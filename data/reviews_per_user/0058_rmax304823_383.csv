The Rock," Actioner, efficient and predictable.
","If you're in the mood for an implausible but reassuringly familiar action flick, this should do the job. I don't know that there is a single original thought in this flick. It's all been done before in one guise or another, but it's done about as well here as anywhere else.Car chases of course are de rigueur. This one involves a Ferarri and a dozen cop cars chasing a Humvee up and down the steep hills of San Francisco. There are multiple smash-ups with flying glass everywhere. The Ferarri knocks down a row of parking meters, spilling thousands of pennies. A telephone pole collapses across the street. Cars do one-and-a-half gainers in midair. A streetcar is blown straight up and comes straight down. And so forth. The chase itself is without point.I lost count of the number of bodies that crashed through glass windows in slow motion, or the number of deaths by slow-motion exploding squib charges. Bodies fall through glass ceilings or are impaled on some kind of pointed spikes. Is all this beginning to sound familiar?There is one novel note -- the labyrinthine underground of Alcatraz. Who really knows or remembers what's down there? What we see is a jungle of twisted and rusting iron, crusty gratings, burnt orange bursts of flame that come out of nowhere and accomplish nothing, over-sized rotating cogs, small railroad tracks with small carts on them, caverns, sewers, lots of water, pipes emitting plumes of steam (where is the steam coming from and where is it going?). But -- well, why not? Nobody knows or cares what's really down there. It could be the hanging gardens of Babylon for all anyone knows.That's about it for originality. Sean Connery and Nicholas Cage and Ed Harris are good, as usual. The production values are high (all those smashed cars). The script is sprinkled with wisecracks, like a Schwarzenegger movie, in order to warn us against taking all this too seriously, as if warnings were necessary. The car chase is punctuated by the expectable imprecations -- 'Hope you have insurance!' and 'Sorry about that!'It must have been a bad idea to turn the Marines into heavies, so in the finale, the movie makes General Harris the only man of principle, however misguided that principle may be, and turns the others into nothing more than money-hungry mercenaries. The plot is so disarticulated that after Ed Harris is offed, another Marine has to become the chief heavy and he has a jaw like King Kong and a haircut like Hugh Grant or Hugh Jackman or whoever it is that has his long hair parted in the middle. You can tell all the bad guys anyway because they have bulging eyeballs that glow with lunacy, or they have sneers that radiate contempt for all the good things God has blessed us with in modern life, like Brittny Spears. Ed Harris, the Marine of principle, had to die a noble death. His evil successor has to be made to swallow a poison pill the size of a tennis ball and then melt on screen. The others, the 'phony soldiers', to borrow a phrase, are just in it for the blackmail money. This is a common device used to avoid offending anyone in the audience. It can't be the REAL Marine Corps, so it has to be a loony splinter group of thieves. In 'Patriot Games', it's not the real IRA but a splinter group. In 'Air Force One', it's not the real Russians but a splinter group. In Clint Eastwood's 'The Enforcer,' it's not even the real 'People's Army' because the 'people' in the audience might take it personally, so it's a phony band of greedy gangsters posing as a populist army. Yes. If you like to see cars doing grand jetes and exploding fireballs and ugly guns, this is your movie. Cage and Connery work very well with one another and seem to be having a lot of fun. They have just solved the problem and ended the threat, but can they call off the air strike that is seconds away from being unleashed on them? Guess.My biology is long behind me and I know nothing of VX, but if it is a cholinesterase inhibitor, isn't it similar to, or the same thing, as black widow spider venom? And if so, what does it have to do with melting your skin?",5,6,10,11 April 2004
The Devil's Advocate," The Devil in Ms. Lomax.
","Nicely photographed and generally well acted. It's a pleasure to look at it on the screen. And there's some nifty dialog.Charlize Theron is like chewing gum for the eyes, with her chubby cheeks and pretty, plump lips. You've just got to love ballerinas. And Connie Nielson is a treat too, although of a different kind. Not chewing gum exactly. Maybe a sourball. She has a distinctively sensual squint from which two surprisingly innocent eyes seem to glow. Nobody projects virginal depravity better than she.Al Pacino is reliable in a loud and expansive role, waving his arms, 'Hoo'-ing his way through the movie, eyes abulge. Keanu Reeves looks handsome as a Southern lawyer although he doesn't bring much to the part. He can shout as well as Pacino but it's like watching an animatronic figure in Disneyland's Hall of Presidents shout. The effort shows through the performance and it's not really very convincing. Also, saints preserve us, how naive can a lawyer be? But even if everything else were perfect, the movie would still be confused about exactly what it's trying to be. A story of corruption at high-income levels, like 'The Firm' or 'Wall Street'? A courtroom drama? The dramatic story of a devoted wife's breakdown? A supernatural thriller grappling with Big Questions? In the end it turns out to be a kind of ragout with the ingredients dominating in the order they're listed above. The climax is entirely and fantastically supernatural.And what theology it is! Catechism is more complicated. This theology is really very simple. There's a real, genuine Christian God (who is of no help whatever, except that he's given us 'free will'). There is a good old-fashioned devil whose sole aim seems to be to noodge God and tick Him or Her off like a pebble in a shoe. The devil organized this gigantic and successful law firm because he wants to acquit everyone. (If he weren't a fallen angel he'd be all for burning at the stake.) There's a heaven, just as we've been told, and it seems like a Christian heaven. And there's a hell too. And judging from the last scene, involving a naked Nielson and orgiastic figures in a huge bas relief, the chiefest of sins is sex. It almost seems that the religious theme is built around Reeves' fundamentalist faith.And, boy, is there punishment. At the end, just as he's about to do Connie Nielson, Reeves decides to shoot himself instead. Now, this strikes me as a major error in judgment, but let it go. As Reeves' dead body topples towards the floor, Pacino, the devil in the case, begins screaming, 'NOOO! NOOO!' Connie Nielsen drops dead and rots on screen. Pacino somehow loses his clothes and then is burned alive -- or dead -- whatever. Everyone is shrieking and the screen is filled with special effects. It isn't explained how this particular earthly enterprise of the devil's can be destroyed by the suicide of one dumb guy.It's pleasant to look at it, yes, but I'd have settled for that courtroom drama instead of this confused and confusing mishmash.",4,6,15,6 September 2006
The King's Speech," It's Trying To Be The King.
","Nobody looks much like the Windsors, and 'Churchill' doesn't look much like Churchill, but it doesn't matter much in this suspenseful, comic, and human story of the future King George VI (Firth) learning to overcome his stammering under the idiosyncratic tutelage of his speech therapist (Rush). It's a good movie.The period covered in from the early 1930s to the outbreak of World War II in 1939. They weren't easy years for England. The Great Depression was world wide. Hitler had come to power in Germany and was threatening war. And King George V (Gambon) died and left the crown to the somewhat flighty Edward VIII (Pearce). It didn't take much to be flighty. At his father's death bed, Pearce breaks down and weeps on his mother's shoulder instead of maintaining the requisite stiff upper lip. On top of that, Pearce is sleeping with the ex flapper Wallace Simpson, who is not only an American from Baltimore but twice divorced. When Pearce follows his bliss and resigns, the Kinghood is thrust on Firth who, for the life of him, cannot give a speech without a discrediting stutter.But the story itself isn't unfamiliar. He hires Rush to help him and Rush, a failed Australian actor with no medical credentials, uses the usual means to aid him in grappling with the king's problem. He taunts him, calls him 'Bertie' instead of using the honorific, bets him shillings and then keeps bringing the debt up when Firth has lost. He has Firth doing silly thing like rolling around on the floor and speaking while his Firth's wife sits on his chest. Some of his techniques sound more useful. At a difficult juncture, Firth should pause and think to himself, 'God save the king.' (Firth: 'I do, but no one seems to be listening.') In any case, in the shadow of dark clouds of anxiety and uncertainty, Firth manages successfully to wend his way through his first war-time speech, while Rush stands before him waving his hands like a conductor. That is to say, there's a happy ending.The direction by Tom Hooper is clean and functional. The camera is handled in a manner fit for adults -- and why not? Nobody who gets his rocks off watching human bodies being torn apart is going to bother with a movie about some Ancient King of England or someplace who has trouble giving a speech. And who is this 'Hitler', anyway? The performances are unimpeachable. I don't know that Firth exactly stammers. He seems to hesitate, repeat morphemes, gulp, and smack his lips a lot. As his wife, Helena Bonham Carter is cute and perfectly competent. Rush gives a marvelously sensitive performance despite its occasional formulaic moments.In real life, the Rush figure was given an award for special assistance to the king. A similar award should be given to Production Design, Set Decoration, and Art Direction for special assistance rendered to 'The King's Speech.' One look at Rush's flat is enough to spoil your appetite. That title, by the way, 'The King's Speech', I take to have a double meaning -- one is Firth's manner of speaking, the other is to the triumphant final speech he manages to deliver successfully over the BBC.Don't be put off by the subject, which sounds trivial. It's a nicely planned and executed job.",8,0,1,8 January 2012
Moneyball," Money's Not Even A Good Way Of Keeping Score.
","Brad Pitt is Billy Beane, General Manager for the Oakland Athletics. I add, for our overseas friends, that the Oakland Athletics are a baseball team in California, distinguished chiefly by their outer uniforms of dull gray and their jerseys of putrid green. And I will take a guess that this story is based on fact because no writers would deliberately give a baseball manager a name like Billy Beane outside of a comedy.It's directed by Bennett Miller, and a very nice job he's done too. Here we have a story about the tense decision-making that goes on behind a game in which there is plenty of suspense and action, and yet Miller uses a classic approach to the narrative. The camera doesn't wobble drunkenly. The cuts aren't instantaneous. The speech has the rhythms of real life with hesitations ('umm,' 'ahhh') and pauses, either awkward or thoughtful, between utterances. Viewers used to crackling commotion and ballbreaking bustle may be disappointed to find that most of the important stuff takes place in offices and the facilities of a stadium. Nobody wrenches anybody else's head off. And there's no sex and little sentiment.The acting is on a par with the direction. Brad Pitt is pretty good, despite his conventional good looks and muscles. His job is to figure out how to turn a losing team with no money into a winning team with no money. The rest of the cast is fine, including Philip Seymour Hoffman in a relatively minor role as Pitt's antagonist. Pitt has a teen-aged daughter too, but she's not a modelesque beauty, thank God, just an ordinary looking kid. Jonah Hill plays a chubby economics graduate from Yale, one of those freaks who has really gotten seriously into baseball stats, along the lines of Steven Jay Gould. By means of complex mathematical equations that are never explained, and which you and I wouldn't understand anyway, Hill has computerized every player's potential, based strictly on performance, and scored them on a ratio scale. The human element is not quantifiable so it's dropped. Pitt decides the kid is onto something and adopts the anfractuous and inhuman rating system wholesale, dumping some players, trading others, buying still others who look oversold.It's not entirely successful though. Again, the colors are drawn from the ghoulish end of the palette, no help to those sleeves. And the writers have made a big mistake. They've assumed a certain level of knowledge of the game that some viewers simply won't have. Take my brother, for instance. Here he is, sitting in the living room with Dad. Dad's in his usual undershirt, guzzling his beer, and watching a ball game on the tube. My brother shows no obvious interest in the goings on and Dad asks if he, Dad, is correct in assuming my brother is bored. 'Yes.' Then Dad asks whether Bobby is interested in the game, and my brother says, 'Not as far as I know.' Okay. The game proceeds for a minute, then Dad turns to my brother and asks, 'Are you guys faggots?' A second error, though I don't know that it could easily have been avoided, is that the script tells us nothing about the tactical details of the game or, indeed, about the players. I couldn't tell one from the other. At one point, Pitt advises a player to stop stealing second base. 'That's what I do.' 'Well, don't. You're paid to get a hit, not to get thrown out at second.' The exchange is meaningless because it lacks context. We don't know the player; we don't know that he tries too often to steal a base. Nothing. All the tension is focused on Pitt's character as he desperately tries to implement Hill's computer theory before -- wait for it -- he discovers that 'winning isn't everything' and that 'money isn't a good way of keeping score.' Yet, those weaknesses aside, this a refreshing movie, innovative in its naturalism and in the apparent spontaneity it manages to capture. If only the narrative weren't all so awfully foggy.",5,0,1,7 December 2012
Million Dollar Arm," Feel Good Movie.
","It's rather like a cable TV movie, which starts out funny, becomes a bit gloomy, and then ends on a transcendent note. And there's not an unpredictable moment in it.That's not necessarily bad. When we encounter a ritualized narrative like this, it can be relaxing. There may not be thrills galore or laugh galore or anything else galore, but it's a fixed point in a changing and disappointing universe, like a church service.John Hamm is a sports agent or some kind of promoter who is running short of clients and needs to find a super pitcher to sell to a baseball team. He's all business. That's why he's able to drive a gold-plated Bugatti and live in a Los Angeles house that Frank Sinatra might have approved of. He has a sexy tenant living in a cottage in his backyard but he has no time for her,.So, with the backing of an inscrutable Oriental angel, he goes to India and recruits two young guys who bowl at cricket games. They've got speed up the मलाशय but they're wild. Their pitches go all over the place.The naive kids are brought back to Lower California and subject to discipline and training. Hamm shows little interest in their progress because he's too involved with pimping his services to other clients. The kids are terribly homesick. They've never seen a big city; they don't know what a baseball mitt is. They eat too much pizza or accidentally drink alcohol and puke in his spiffy sports car.The inscrutable Oriental insists that the agreed-upon time limit is observed but the kids aren't quite ready and they fail their first public test because they are nervous. A cloud of gloom. Hamm is angry. The Indians are ashamed.Cherchez la femme. Lake Bell emerges from the cottage in the back yard, gets to know the kids, seduces Hamm, and together Bell and the Indians humanize Hamm. He gives up all his other clients and fully commits himself to the job. The kids throw him a lavish party and Bell is Hamm's date. She wears a sari and sports a bindhi.And they all live happily ever after -- we're led to believe.I can't really recommend it because so little of it shows any originality, but the performances are pretty good. Alan Arkin shows up long enough to collect his paycheck. John Hamm could be interesting in another cinematic context. He sort of looks like a movie star and has a husky voice. It would be nice to see if he has any range or whether he's headed for television. I didn't find Lake Bell's character appealing -- perceptive, candid, full of common sense. And her voice is that of a locomotive grinding to a halt.But if you don't feel like answering a challenge, if you just want to stretch out and watch a warm film full of human interest, this is your huckleberry.",5,1,1,13 February 2015
Angels & Demons," Pursuit, Becoming Hotter.
","Tom Hanks carries on in his role as a Harvard symbologist. This time he's called to the Vatican because of threats received from an anti-clerical group called the Illuminati -- revenge for the way the church mistreated the Illuminati hundreds of years ago, driving them underground and almost exterminating them. (Kids, the Vatican is an independent city with its own police force and a staff of Swiss mercenary guards and is in the middle of Rome, which in turn is in the middle of a European country called Italy.) The Pope has just died and the city, waiting for the next Pope to be chosen, is in a tumult of anticipation, waving flags, setting of fireworks, punching each other out, and choking the grounds of St. Peter's. It's in this disorderly milieu that Hanks is asked to find and disable one of those ticking time bombs set by the Illuminati. The Illuminati have also kidnapped four cardinals from the Vatican and will kill one per hour until five hours later, when the anti-matter bomb will go off with the biggest bang known to man, beast, or celluloid. The device is hidden somewhere on the grounds of the Vatican itself -- maybe.Then it gets really twisted and turns into two or three plot threads. Will Hanks exchange kisses with his beautiful Italian assistant? Who is the madman behind the plot and how do we find him? Who is the insider in the Vatican who is screwing everything up? And -- pride of place -- WILL they find that monstrous and incandescently evil anti-matter bomb? The bulk of the film is given over to the last task -- finding that bomb -- and, with only four or five hours before it explodes, everyone is forced to run instead of walk and to drive at top speed through the traffic-choked streets of the city. And the byways of Rome are something to behold. I had an encounter with a policeman who was directing traffic by hand at a busy crossroad. As I oozed past him I shouted a quick request for directions. He stepped off his pedestal, walked over to the car, leaned on the windowsill and began chatting in the most friendly manner about an uncle who lived in New York.At any rate, we have Hanks and his intense female companion running from one landmark to the next, followed by the Vatican and Roman police force and Peter Skarsgaard, chief of the Swiss Guards. The clock on doomsday is winding down. Two or three of the hostage cardinals have already been branded and murdered. (One corpse seems to have been in this condition for much longer than a few hours.) In other words it's a chase movie, involving cues that I -- a humble shoemaker -- was unable to follow. I DID manage to get the reference to Bernini's marble statue of St. Teresa having a mystic experience. We actually get to see it, or a replica, and it's magnificent art work. You don't get a decent view of it or you'd be able to see down Teresa's wide open mouth into her throat and wonder how it was possible for Bernini to polish her tonsils. And hovering over her while she levitates is a smiling cupid holding a golden arrow. Instead of the arrow pointing to Teresa's nether regions, suggesting not an epiphany so much as an orgasm, as in the original, whoever has been leaving the clues has twisted the arrow in a direction that will lead Hanks and the rest to the next location. No, I didn't get it either.I found the movie watchable but confusing because it's so episodic and convoluted. There were some James Bond moments that left me wondering why they were there. And the plot is a kind of paradox in that the person mainly responsible for the entire thing foils the plot without explanation. I gather this has now become another franchise. Tom Hanks, the Harvard symbologist, and an attractive assistant are called in to solve a conspiracy that will bring about a disaster. Haven't we seen this before?",6,0,1,17 September 2017
Kill Bill: Vol. 2," A Long Trail That Has No Turning.
","'Pulp Fiction' struck me as a haphazard masterpiece of originality. The incongruity was startling -- Bruce Willis and Ving Rhames tied up in a basement, their mouth stuffed with Japanese S/M balls, and an old Turkish pop song clanging away loudly in the background. And, wow, did 'Pulp Fiction' have style of a particularly visual sort. It was hard to care who lived or died except that it's usually better when characters survive.'Kill Bill, Vol. 2,' is an extended revenge story full of twists, pain, and blood. In this one, I cared chiefly that the heroine, Uma Thurman, would survive. Who could not? The gangly all-encompassing limbs. The long monkey feet. The bent nose. The plumbless blue depths of those irises as they peer at us out of a face spattered with gore.But this is a triumph of visuals in which the characters and actions are stylized almost out of existence. People strike odd poses and speak deliberately, relishing each syllable. The amazing thing is that despite the abstraction of style and its fragile roots in reality Tarantino manages to get moments of genuine excitement and terror out of the story. It makes you not want to be buried alive.The highlight comes when two blond babes -- Thurman and Darryl Hannah -- face one another with and without expensive Japanese Hondo swords. The camera zooms in and out in a frenzy, sometimes with only a single eyeball as its focus, while the air inside a shack is filled with flying kicks and flashing steel, of a like never before seen by any human being except those who have known my ex wife. I'll tell you, this scene alone left me panting and exhausted.But for all the flash, it's more a fantasy than anything else, only one or two steps away from a kid's cartoon or a computer war game. I got some of the in jokes and allusions, I think, but the imagery becomes tiresome after a while. It all prompted me to with that everyone had sat down for an hour or two with a couple of bottles of Dos Equis and simply, I don't know, taken a breather.",6,2,4,26 April 2012
The Legend of Bagger Vance," Up To Par.
","This tale hangs on a well-worn peg. An African-American (Smith) acts as coach and mentor to a talented young white man (Damon) who must overcome inner demons.The game is golf. But Smith, who wanders into Damon's yard out of the night, is something more than a supportive friend. His lines turn him into a Zen master. 'Every man has that perfect swing inside him.' 'You lost your swing but you don't find it -- it finds you.' 'Close your eyes and feel the field.' 'Golf is a game that can't be won, only played.' That last one is a doozie because life has that same quality of course. The last we see of Smith is his silhouette, wandering off, hands in pockets, into a florid sunset. He came like water and like the wind he went.But Smith has some of the better lines too. In an important match, the Savanna Open or the Atlanta Closed or something, Damon winds up in the sand trap, the ball half buried. He turns to Smith, who is watching dispassionately. 'What do I do now?' Smith: 'About what?' The director, Robert Redford, has turned golf into a religious experience. Mystical music play while Damon contemplates the field. It's like watching Ben Hur play golf. And when the little white ball sails through the air, we hear a heavenly chorus.Golf, despite its sanctity and the imprimatur of St. Andrew himself, has always struck me as absurd. Grown men taking a stick and trying to knock a little ball into a hole in the earth. Take away the sticks, shrink the field, and you'd have a great game of marbles.Redford doesn't spell out all the technical details although they sometimes crop up willy nilly in the dialog. I never had the slightest idea of what a sand trap had a 'lip' or what an 'iron' was. Now I have the slightest idea. You can pick up the argot from the context.The photography of South Carolina is exquisitely done and the period details are amusing to see. The performances are all professional too. I particularly liked Charlize Theron as one of Damon's demons, the other being his shattering experiences in World War I. Certainly, Theron is beautiful but Hollywood is filled with beautiful women. Theron has rather more than these accidental attributes going for her. For one thing, she is a polished ballerina and can still bust a couple of tough moves. For another, she speaks Afrikaans. Her rosy aereolae may be a bit circumscribed in their extent but she can be forgiven for that. It's curious that her theme line with Damon should be 'I like the way you dance.' In many ways -- in many fundamental ways -- it's a dumb movie, but it's done so well that I hung with it, tensely, until the inevitable outcome of the only golf match the movie shows us.",7,0,1,9 April 2015
Vertigo," Only the most shallow man would fail to be impressed by appearances.
","'Vertigo' is considered Hitchcock's masterpiece by high-brows and viewed as a slow, dull movie by proletarians. Indulge this Olympian generalizations for a moment. If you don't know the story by now, it goes something like this. Jimmy Stewart is a San Francisco detective retired from the force because he contracted a severe case of acrophobia on the job. An old college friend, Gavin Elster, hires him to follow Elster's wife, Madeleine (Kim Novak) around. Elster is afraid Madeleine is going nuts. Stewart takes the job and is soon hooked on the lovely Madeleine. He rescues her from a suicide attempt, lugs her unconscious body to his own apartment, undresses her, and puts her in his bed until she recovers. Stewart and Madeleine fall in love, but she's still balmy and climbs to the tower of an old church to kill herself. Stewart can't follow because of his acrophobia. He blames himself. Later, while wandering the city streets, he spots a girl named Judy Barton (also Kim Novak) who resembles the departed Madeleine. Stewart gets to know her, squires her around, and step-by-step has her dress and groom herself exactly like his lost love. Then he discovers that Judy IS in fact his lost love. Judy was in cahoots with Gavin Elster and Stewart was a victim of a hoax designed to get rid of Elster's real wife. It ends tragically.It's neither a masterpiece nor dull, really. I don't doubt for a minute that it's Hitchcock's most personal movie. Cripes, he's got this luscious blond he keeps dressing and undressing, gorgeous and sexy, but also unattainable and ghostly. (A ghost of substantial heft, though.) That was always Hitchcock's fantasy, the icy Nordic who would attack you in the back seat of a taxi. (Poor Alma Reville, his wife, a rather homely brunette dwarf.) On top of the personal interest that Hitchcock lavished on the story, he adds some technical dazzle. Not too much. The acrophobic detective stares down the tall campanile and the camera simultaneously zooms in and dollies back. The tactic was so successful it's been imitated a number of times. And when Stewart and Novak finally kiss and make love in her green-lighted apartment, the director has them and the camera on a turntable that slowly revolves and shows us varied haunting backdrops. And the movie wouldn't be what it is without Bernard Hermann's romantic and oneiristic score.The whole film is meant to be dream-like and that's why it's understandable that some people would see it as irritatingly slow. It follows Edgar Allan Poe's theory of literary aesthetics. Poe threw reason off the bell tower and went for eerie effects, period. A man buries a murder victim under the floor but nails a cat in with the body by mistake. How can anyone miss a cat that's in the burial chamber? I can imagine viewers now, squirming, and asking, 'Where the hell is the logic in this movie?' Let's put it this way. You are a girl named Judy Barton. You're pretty but have no marketable skills. A very wealthy man comes to you and offers you money to help him kill his wife. All you have to do is impersonate the wife and trap a former detective named Jimmy Stewart into falling in love with you and then lead him to a place where the wife can be safely killed and still look like suicide.Then, after the rich dude takes off for Europe, leaving you to become your slovenly self, you accidentally run into the victimized Stewart on the streets. (In a city of 700,000.) He doesn't recognize you, naturally, because now, having reverted to your original persona, you look like an overly made-up hooker. But he follows you home, knocks on your door, introduces himself, and asks you for a date. I ask you -- the discerning, sophisticated, somewhat street-savvy viewer -- would you accept? Would you date a man who will almost inevitably find out you're a murderess? One slip of the tongue could do it. The only person stupid enough to accept would also bury a black cat alongside a dead body.Kim Novak is a lot more effective as Madeleine than as Judy. The latter persona is coarse but tender too. The former is elegant and speaks in a ghostly whisper. Kim Novak was probably right for the part. As Judy, she has these overemphatic eyebrows that lend her the appearance of a Universal monster, perhaps one of the lesbian vampires that smiles as she pours you the drugged wine. But of Hitchcock's other actresses at the time, who else could have done better? The photography is splendid. And the director takes us on a Cook's Tour of many of the Bay Area landmarks -- Ernie's restaurant (now gone), Muir Woods almost, The Palace of the Legion of Honor, Fort Point, Mission San Juan Bautista (which has no tower), Point Lobos. And every day is perfectly sunny. Stewart re-dresses Novak at an expensive shop that was Ransohoff's at the time. It, too, is now gone but I took my wife to its less expensive replacement and insisted she buy a signature gray suit with a soft white shirt and a pair of brown heels. She swore she would do no such thing. After a slight scuffle, not nearly as athletic as the papers made it out to be, we wound up with some cheap scrap of an apron. (She never wore it.) It's only in a film in which there is no place for common sense, let alone genuine logic, that a man can create a new woman or resurrect an old one.I find it a fascinating movie, technically almost perfect, and worth repeated viewings if they're not repeated too often. (It's pretty depressing.) It's at once demanding and rewarding. And I'm certainly glad Hitchcock made it, if only to get it out of his system.",8,9,13,12 October 2008
"The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert"," Exuberant Road Movie.
","Three professional drag queens -- the curious-looking Weaving, the muscular Pearce, and the aging Stamp -- decide to leave Sidney for a gig in the town of Alice Springs in the middle of nowhere. What follows is a road trip out of 'The Electric Koolade Acid Test.' They make no secret of their gender orientation. On their journey through the vast desert they encounter puzzlement and prejudice. Their performance in Alice Springs wins no prizes but Weaving acquires the cheerfully accepting wife and son he'd left behind, and Stamp can quit worrying about wrinkles because he's found a nice, good-natured bloke to settle down with.I'd imagine that one of the problems in making (or appreciating) a movie like this is what you do after the initial shock of seeing three guys prance around in fancy costumes wears off. Stephen Elliott, the writer/director, has generally gotten past the problem. The three guys are soon individualized. Weaver is the anxious, uncertain guy with the odd ball eyebrows. Pearce is flamboyant and chipper. Stamp is somber and worried about what will happen now that his looks have faded.But turning three fairies into persons is the easy part. 'The Boys In The Band' did it with a snap of the fingers. The tough part is laying out a story with some substance to it. Otherwise the viewer is liable to be bored listening to the bitchy insults and improbable displays. Elliott and the cast give the story just enough juice to get us all through it happily, aided immeasurably by the incandescent magnificence of the Australian outback. You have never seen such sere and blasted vistas. Well, not since 'Lawrence of Arabia'.What really worried me was that this effervescent flick would turn 'serious' in the end -- sentimental and sloppy. You know -- one of the trio is beaten to death or contracts AIDS or something. It doesn't happen. I grovel in gratitude.And how do the boys handle the roles? Pretty well, as far as that goes. Their act consists of appearing on stage in kaleidoscopically gaudy outfits and make up and making believe they are singing and dancing to a recorded song. The songs aren't bad, by the way. You won't get boiler maker's gap from listening to disco or pop songs from the 40s. Stamp and his frown look completely out of place under a mop of plastic hair. His settling down was little loss to the act. Weaving doesn't look bad as a prismatically groomed young woman. And Pearce doesn't look bad at all until you get down to the muscles, which remind you that he is a more slender simulacrum of Arnold Schwarzenegger. There used to be shows like theirs at the now-defunct Finnochio's in San Francisco, a tourist spot frequented by celebrities for some thirty years. I had a chat with the actor Thomas Gomez there.It's an interesting film, never really boring, and gorgeously photographed. It's a kind of lesson in how to construct a good time out of nothing much. They have a lot of fun, and if they get punched in the face by some redneck, they cry and sulk for a while but soon get over it.",7,0,2,14 June 2012
Black Swan," The Pink Shoes.
","This may be one of the most deliberately confusing movies ever made. Somebody started off with an interesting variation on an old idea. Let's have a very talented person go nuts while achieving stardom and then die after much suffering and one absolutely perfect performance.Instead of the rock scene or movie stardom -- among the more common venues -- we'll set it in the ballet arena. That's full of egotists, isn't it? Kind of like opera? It's a reasonable enough premise. Being a ballet dancer is no easy job. It requires infinite practice, precision, devotion, competitiveness, and a physical fitness rivaling that of a championship boxer. Enough to drive anybody nuts.Then it must have occurred to someone that a movie about a young woman, Portman, who becomes a star at the price of her own sanity is going to have an audience of about ten people, not including the producers and their mothers. Who's going to watch a movie about going for the perfect saute fouette? So they juiced it up using two techniques, both of which manage to scrap any pretensions to seriousness that the original idea might have had.The film has all the clichés of any other straight-to-DVD horror movie. There is the oppressive and demanding mother, Barbara Hershey, from 'Carrie.' There is the 'friend' who may or may not be angling for the role of prima ballerina. The dance director, Cassel, is an untrustworthy heterosexual, and if I remember you'll find the same figure in 'The Red Shoes'. There's no one else of importance in the movie. Cassel is staging 'Swan Lake' and he sees in Portman a very good white swan full of the usual virtues but not her evil twin, the black swan. Portman can't seem to let her passions loose so Cassel gives her helpful instruction like, 'Go home and touch yourself.' (She can't do it because she's interrupted by the image of her overbearing mother.) Later, Cassel takes Portman aside, begins smooching her fiercely and feeling her up until she begins to respond. At this point he pushes her away and says, 'See? I'm seducing you when it is you who should be seducing me.' The fool. There isn't a single person who listens sympathetically to Portman. Even her affable understudy, Mila Kunis, may have ulterior motives for trying to get Portman to loosen up, have a few drinks, do a Lude or two.But it's very difficult to tell whether Kunis is a real friend or not because Portman is cracking up and the viewer, like Portman, is unable to distinguish hallucinations from reality. The Jungian shadow is always nudging its way into her life. Does Portman really kill Kunis? If so, she does it in a formulaic and unrealistic way, copped from innumerable other horror movies. She grabs a piece of broken mirror and shoves it into Kunis's belly. As usual, the point pierces the stomach and leaves the hand clutching the glass unmolested. You can't help wincing when you see something as dumb as this. It's like the scene in which two guys are fighting and one knocks the other out by bumping heads. Newton's third law is herewith repealed.And the hallucinations, which seem to involve everything in and around Portman, gives the computer-generated image guys an excuse to go berserk. For no reason at all, while Portman is alone, both her legs snap into the shape of chicken legs with the knees backwards. I guess nobody could think of where to take that dismal picture so it fades to black. I mean, what are they going to have her do, sit down in a chair? Through all this mishigas, the camera never leaves Portman alone long enough to take a breather. She's a beautiful young woman, though her voice comes out in her few lines as a kind of hoarse squeak. But, really, she's in just about every frame and almost always in close up. If she runs down a hall, the camera wobbles along, a foot behind her head. Talk about oppression! It isn't that horror movies are in themselves bad. It all depends on how they're done. Hell, Val Lewton turned out some psychological horror movies at RKO in the early 40s that were masterful, and on a budget that wouldn't sustain a normal person for a year, and barely keep a gerbil alive. This one had genuine potential. It did not actually need CGIs that turn Portman's hands and forearms into bloated, gangrenous limbs. Acute schizophrenia can be rendered in subtle ways too. See Roman Polanski's 'Repulsion.' I, for one, am beginning to regret CGI was ever invented. Useful for dinosaurs and UFOs, yes, but they're becoming an excuse for not thinking enough about the plots themselves. When your mind becomes blank, you just have somebody's face fall off.

Changeling," Society Tries to Impose Happy Ending on Tragedy But Mom Turns Down Role.
","One of Clint's more challenging films. Angelina Jolie's young son disappears and the corrupt LAPD, prodded into a search, try to foist off a different kid on her. She denies it is her son. The police want the case wrapped up and Jolie's public complaints are becoming a nuisance so they have her committed to a psychiatric hospital where she undergoes various horrifying experiences.Then a boy shows up in police custody, an illegal Canadian immigrant, who begins to tell a blood-curdling tale of being held with other boys on a ranch near Riverside. The rancher, a fruitcake named Northcott, was in the habit of kidnapping young boys wholesale and slaughtering them at his pleasure with an ax. The ex-Canadian identifies Jolie's son as one of the twenty or so victims. Northcott is captured in Vancouver, convicted in Los Angeles, and hanged in San Quentin.Years later, still another kid shows up and reveals that, in fact, he and Jolie's son managed a joint escape. The other boy may still be out there somewhere, alive, afraid to return home. The last shot is of Jolie walking with a smile down the street. 'It's given me something I didn't have before.' A detective who has backed her in the case says, 'Huh? What's that?' 'Hope,' says Jolie sweetly.That final exchange gave me a shudder because just for a moment a flashbulb exploded in my admittedly unusual brain and I was suddenly watching an old episode of 'Dragnet.' In fact, the first half hour or more focuses on Angelina Jolie, earth mother. If the end sounded like 'Dragnet,' the whole beginning of the story looked and sounded like a movie on LMN, the kind with titles like 'Please Don't Take My Baby!' and 'Why Are You Doing This To Me?' Jolie handles the role of the despairing but ever hopeful mother with seasoned skill but it's a stereotype nevertheless. She's loving, plucky, and defiant in the face of patronizing cops or brutal hospital staff. She gets to weep a lot. My heart was sinking along with hers, as I was pinning down the difference between Eastwood's ambitious story and a typical LMN offering -- higher production values and more expensive actors in the former.Happily the narrative takes a turn for the better when it shifts from Jolie's clichÃ©d tribulations to the new investigation by the police, led sub rosa by a sympathetic but thoroughly UN-stereotyped tough cop, played by Michael Kelly. His is one of three outstanding performances in the film, the others' being that of the mass murderer Northcott, played by Jason Butler Harner, and the final escaped child to turn up in custody and tell the tale, Asher Axe. Harner's role is a difficult one. He must shift his demeanor, his motives, his whole persona, in different directions at different time, a Proteus of a character. The part isn't that well written and it takes skill to pull it off.In fact, the movie itself doesn't follow the usual narrative template. That's not bad in itself. If the story is based on real events, it can only be twisted so far. But this plot is wrought by the writer, J. Michael Straczynski, in a way that seems to me to hold the audience in something like contempt. Anti-climax follows anti-climax with the strictness of a religious ritual. And we don't really get a single solid scene with Northcott the monster until his execution when, yet again, we get to go through the process -- the shivering convict, the solemn reverend, the thirteen steps, the grim witnesses, the black hood, the adjusting of the hairy noose, the checking of the watch to make sure there are no last-minute reprieves, the nod of the warden to the executioner, the flapping of the trap door, the plunging of the shackled body, and this time Clint lingers on the victim's final spasms a long time -- too long. I'm frankly getting tired of these execution scenes. We've seen dozens of them lately. They're getting more and more explicit. Is there some hidden appeal in a realistic scene of a man being deliberately murdered? If so, it's under my head. They're starting to look like slasher movies for adults.It's one of Clint's more arty movies but not, in my opinion, one of his best. The period detail is exquisite. Love those antique cars! But the photography is darker than it needs to be. Even the scene in the desert, with dead bodies being unearthed, is shot late in the afternoon so that the sun is low, the shadows long, and the atmosphere mephitic. There are a few other jarring instants. Jolie would have referred to an 'ice box' rather than a 'fridge' in 1928. And she would not have said, 'F--- you, and the horse you rode in on.' These are lapses in judgment not so much because they're anachronistic but because Clint, as the director, either didn't realize that they were, or, worse, didn't think anyone would notice them. There are other scenes that are eminently predictable -- the hellish psychopathic ward, the pinched-face nurses fire hosing the patient, the screaming fruitcake in the next bunk. With its several flaws, though, the movie is still worth watching. I'd never heard of the case before yet, according to what we see on the screen, it had a great deal of impact on California law.",6,2,6,9 July 2009
The New World," Death and transfiguration.
","This pretty authentic reconstruction of the loves of Pocahontas in the first English colony in the New World, North Carolina, to be exact, is like most of Terence Malick's movies, deliriously slow, suffused with natural beauty, and voiced over with poetic narrative comments that touch only lightly on the scenes we witness.Captain John Smith (Colin Farrell) helps establish the colony in 1607, meets the teen aged Pocahontas (Q'orianka Kilcher), they fall for each other, and then Smith departs for England. Word reaches the colony that he died on the passage. She lives with the English now, going about her chores in a daze, but attracts the widower Guy Rolfe (Christian Bales), who talks her into marriage, has a child with her, and takes her to England with him. She learns that John Smith is still alive and Rolfe frees her to be with Smith. When they meet again, however, she realizes that so much time has past, about 8 years, that she has come to love Rolfe and she returns to him. Pocahontas is introduced to the King and Queen. She dies on the outward passage to the New World, happy enough to leave the future to her son.So far, it sounds like a soap opera and in a way it is, but Malick makes it more than that. There are battles, for instance, between the colonists and the Indians of Powhatan's tribe. (I don't see any reason to call them Native Americans because I've lived with several tribes and they invariably referred to themselves as 'Indians' when speaking English.) It's also a commentary on cultural dominance, though Malick doesn't hit us over the head with it. The location shooting is splendid. Compared to this, Ingmar Bergman's 'Scenes From a Marriage', is very slow indeed.Malick has wisely cast a young woman as Pocahontas who is half Peruvian and half Swiss and who is not a raving knockout, which is the usual tactic. Q'oreanka Kilcher has delicate, feline eyes, a bulky nose, and sensuous lips. I mention this because Malick spends a lot of film time on close ups of her, and it's all to the good. By the end of the film we've come to know her, and she's come to have a wistful beauty that belongs to her and not to Hollywood convention. Malick also seems to believe the audience is mature enough to do without any politically correct attributions of supernal spirituality to the Indians. They're doing okay, and that's good enough. They have a sense of humor and are pretty relaxed about things that have the Englishmen quaking in their boots. But neither do they go out of their way to avoid battles.Malick is an interesting director. His first film, 'Badlands,' was in its own quiet way masterful. The next one, though exhibiting some gorgeous scenery, didn't do well. And 'The Thin Red Line' had the misfortune of being released at the same time as 'Saving Private Ryan,' which was released under the aegis of Steven Spielberg. 'Private Ryan' was an award-winning blockbuster and comparisons with Malick's more subdued, less commercial meditation on Guadalcanal were pointless.This is really well worth seeing.",8,1,3,2 October 2007
Scarface," Things Go Better With Coke
","The visual imagery is strikingly different from Howard Hawks' early 1930s version, but the plot is fundamentally the same, transposed from Al Capone in Chicago in the 1920s, through Tony Camonte and prohibition in the 1930s, to Tony Montana (Al Pacino) and cocaine in Miami in the 1980s. The protagonist begins as an ethnic nobody and rises to the top before being undone by his own reach. There's a sub-plot. A Latin kid falls for a trophy blond before returning to the girl who reflects his own roots, though she may be his sister.I'm not sure about that incest business, which showed up first in a shadowy way in Hawks' film. There it was arguable. Here, with Maria Mastrantonio as Pacino's sister Gina, it's made explicit in Gina's speech before she attempt to shoot Pacino. But, I don't know. Latin culture tends to be pretty protective of its women, who are either Madonnas or whores. (And not just Latins, but other cultures as well, including Samoans.) It's the business of the brother to protect his sister's reputation. True enough, Pacino seems obsessed with Gina, and the director, Brian DePalma, emphasizes this by giving us a close-up of Pacino's glare every time he spots her with a boy friend. But then, after all, Tony kills his best friend for being with his sister, only BEFORE he discovers they're married. Sure, it's ambiguous. It's just hard to believe that what amounts to fratricide would have taken place simply because of incestuous longings.Anyway, enough incest. In Hawks' film, Tony drove an armor-plated car and lived in an armor-plated room. We only knew he was rich because everybody said so. Here, we actually SEE the opulence and, man, is it disgusting. It's ritzy in the same sense that a Las Vegas casino is ritzy, which is to say pretty vulgar. No class, you know? The production designer, glimpsing the plan, just have entered the phase of ejaculatory inevitability. And in Hawks' film there is the usual final shoot out in which the sister is accidentally shot and Tony gets his. It's dramatic but it doesn't last long. In this film it looks a little like World War III. It's not a blood bath. It's literally a swimming pool of blood. (Two of them, in fact.) 'Say hell to my LITTLE FRIEND!', Pacino screams before triggering his grenade-launching assault rifle -- but a bullet is just a bullet after all.Pacino, playing a rogue Cuban, is kind of funny. I wonder if he played it for laughs. His accent is a kind of all-purpose Romance language dialect, edging crabwise at times into some kind of Slavic. And coke has a peculiar effect on him. Where most people get a rush of exhilaration and euphoria from doing a line or two, Pacino can shove his face into a mountain of the stuff, take a big deep breath, and emerge more sluggish and dispirited than before. Michelle Pfeiffer is the trophy blond wife. (Yummy.) If you rubbed her belly with a hundred dollar bill she'd go into tonic immobility like a chicken. I was most impressed by the performance of Arnaldo Santana as Pacino's adversary Ernie, the henchman of Robert Loggia. Pacino has just killed two of his enemies, leaving only the remaining gangster Santana standing next to Loggia's body. (Why does Loggia wear a chai?) As Pacino and his friends are walking out with their guns still asmoke, Steven Bauer glances over and asks, 'What about Ernie?' The expressions that flit across Santana's features at that moment are priceless. He's not exactly terrified. He's just monumentally UNEASY. DePalma stages a few memorable scenes. One is an argument between him and Pfeiffer in a fancy restaurant. My ex wife was a specialist in initiating such public scenes. Another is an attempted assassination of Pacino in his own night club, in which a fat Fellini-esquire clown with a plastic head gets caught in the crossfire while prancing around to 'Strangers in the Night.' The third has Pacino in a marble tub surrounded by sycophants, booze, and bubble bath. The shoot out, with Pacino taking bullet after bullet while waving his arms and screaming vile curses, is hard to take because of its excess. (Let the guy DIE, for crying out loud!)",7,6,11,12 January 2008
Love and Death," Funny.
","Woody Allen wrote and directed this, one of his two most amusing comedies. Not funny/serious, like 'Annie Hall,' which may be his best film ever, but at times hilarious.Allen and Diane Keaton, who plays his distant cousin, are Russians during the Napoleonic era. The climax is their attempt to assassinate Napoleon after he captures Moscow.The plot is ridiculous and encompasses the war, the tangled love affairs, duels, the tendency in Russian novels towards philosophizing and brooding about God, the distinction between aristocrats and serfs. It borrows heavily from Dostoyevsky and especially Tolstoy's 'War and Peace.' Its cinematic touchstones are Sergei Eisenstein and Ingmar Bergman -- some shots parody exactly the images from both.There are too many jokes to list, and it would be a bad idea to even think about it. I'll direct the viewer's attention to two.(1) Allen and Keaton attempt to knock out the Ambassador from Spain by hitting him over the head with a wine bottle. The Ambassador is alerted at the last moment. What follows is a speeded-up silent comedy shtick in which Allen and Keaton try to convince the Ambassador that it was just a game. The illustrate the game by hitting each other over the head with the bottle and laughing as they do so. No music, just a CLUNK each time the bottle lands on somebody's head.(2) Allen is about to be executed but receives a message from God that the Emperor will spare him at the last moment. This sends him into an epiphany in which he looks heavenward and recites a soliloquy about the meaning of life and the prophecies from the Bible. He's carrying on with banalities about how the wicked man will be delivered into the hands of his enemies. The spotlight on him is extinguished but he adds quickly, 'Wait, not yet! I'm not done with the wicked man.' It skewers a number of sacred cows, God and the belief in an afterlife among them.Some of the wisecracks fall a little flat but there are scenes and set pieces that lift it far above most comedies of the decade. He flirts with the paramour of a marksman and is challenged to a duel. The challenge should be to the viewer: Try not to laugh.",7,2,4,30 December 2015
Frost_Nixon," The Main Event.
","The four interviews David Frost conducted with Richard Nixon, the resigned ex-president in his first public outing, were exchanges of information about incidents and the reasons behind them.For added dramatic impact, the writers beef up the emotional and moral load carried by each of the two teams. Frost, a TV celebrity, has lost much of his audience and is making a come back by paying for this production. Nixon has a lot to lose as well. Too many unanswered questions about Watergate hang over his head.The film tries strenuously to take sides. Nixon should be the heavy of the piece. He should break down sobbing on camera under Frost's barrage of penetrating questions.That's the usual formula but it doesn't apply very directly in this case. Nixon defends himself handily and seems at ease and unpretentious. Frank Langella, as Nixon, does his best to invest the character with an explosive kind of anger. I remember from the real interviews, Nixon's statement that if the president does it, it's not illegal. In context, it seemed to me that he was arguing (with a polite and conspiratorial smile) that no president would do something illegal. The way the line is handled by Langella and his director, Ron Howard, it sounds as if Nixon means that the president can do anything he likes, regardless of the legality of the act.Michael Sheen is David Frost and we learn little about him except that he desperately wants the project to be a success. Subsidiary characters help us fill in the blanks and keep us informed about how they'd like viewers to feel.I didn't vote for Nixon but I could never understand the hatred he inspired in some of his critics. He couldn't do anything right. He was despised for eating cottage cheese with ketchup on it, just as our current commander-in-chief is blamed by his enemies for reading speeches from a teleprompter and appointing 'czars'. The logic behind the criticisms is the same, in that there is no logic. Nixon virtually opened China to the West but all people remember about him is his silent-movie villainous eyebrows and Watergate.At the end of the final interview, Nixon admits making 'errors of the heart' and failing the American people. The camera lingers on the man's gloomy face and this is interpreted by commentators as loneliness and self loathing. The cast and crew have turned a sad expression into the breakdown of Captain Queeg and treated it as a giant victory for David Frost.I wound up feeling sorry for Nixon, as some of his biographers have done, Stephen Ambrose and Oliver Stone among them, even when they've begun with the intention of hacking Nixon to pieces.",6,0,2,7 November 2009
Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Kazakhstan discovers America, and vice versa.
","Borat (Sasha Baron Cohen) is a TV broadcaster in Kazakhstan takes a trip to the United States with his roly-poly friend Azamat. His mission: To experience the greatest country on earth and acquaint its citizens with the folkways of Kazakhstan.But first he guides the viewer through his home town, all its glories on display -- the cows in the living room, the incestuous relations, the 'oldest woman in city' who is 47 and looks twice that. This technique is used throughout the film. As Borat and Azamat perambulate, there is a third person always present but never on camera, the photographer who is recording all these adventures on film.The structure is by its nature episodic. There is New York City, where Borat tries to greet pedestrians on the street with a Kazakh kiss on the cheeks and they threaten to emasculate him or rearrange his features. Then there is Washington, DC. Then Atlanta and Dallas, where Borat visits a curio shop that carries items like a bumper sticker with a Confederate flag and the slogan: 'Secession -- Because It's the Right Thing To Do.' Complications arise. Borat happens to catch 'Baywatch' or 'Beverly Hills 12345' or whatever it is and falls in love with Pamela Anderson. His pronunciation of her name -- Pa-MELLA -- is in synch with his English syntax, of which you may get some hint by reading the subtitle of the movie. He is determined to wed her in the Kazakh manner, by kidnapping her. This leads to what impressed me as the funniest scene in the movie. Pamela Anderson is signing her book at a store and Borat joins the line of admirers. When he reaches her, he fawns all over her and produces what looks like a white tablecloth embossed with roses. He lovingly shows it to her and explains that it was made by his wife back in Kazakhstan. But it's not a blanket or a tablecloth. It's a kind of canvas dufflebag and he shouts with the pride of a successful fisherman as he throws it violently over her head, packs her over his shoulder, and tries to run away with her.It is, at times, a very funny film, right down to the credits and the subtitles. Yet there was something distasteful about it too. It's not a particularly good-natured film. Cohen wrote it himself and some of the scenes are up-dated slapstick -- two naked men, one of them impossibly obese, wrestling at a public meeting. It's outrageous but it's not exactly clever. Then, too, Cohen seems to have taken aim at people and notions he personally finds offensive. Christian evangelicals come in for ridicule when they speak in tongues and go through faith healings. Homosexuals get it too. And he announces to a large rally, 'I support your war of terror in Iraq!' (Some targets deserve to be skewered.) The only people who seem thoroughly decent and polite are an elderly African-American lady and a Jewish couple who run a Bed and Breakfast place. Borat is an anti-Semitic and he covertly spits out the food they serve him. I'd have found the comedy more satisfying if it dealt with the politically correct Thought Police or something. Or militant minority groups and their leaders. Spread it around a little bit, you know? One bunch of loonies is as silly as another. His victims are safe, easy to mock. (How did he miss the Miss American pageant?)The underlying theme of contempt is not dismissable, but what we see is diverting and amusing enough and we can thank the Great Jub Jub that at no point does Cohen treat the material as serious enough to turn it into a platitudinous sermon on tolerance, understanding, and love. That's one big pitfall that every attempt at comedy must skirt, and 'Borat' does so successfully.",6,0,0,28 December 2008
Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," Holmes: Killed in Action Movie.
","On the plus side, the acting isn't bad. Downey's Sherlock Holmes is adequate, including his accent. From certain angles he's beginning to look like Dustin Hoffman as he aged. Jude Law, likewise, delivers as a more than usually active Dr. Watson. Sebastian Moran I dismiss, but Jared Harris as Professor Moriarty is quite good, especially considering that he doesn't look the part as it was described in the canon. Best of all, though, is Steven Frey as Mycroft Holmes, Sherlock's brother. His flabby geniality and hooded eyes suggest a wry dispassion. I think he may have been Oscar Wilde in another film. If he wasn't, he should have been.An avalanche of plot twists almost buries some of the clever lines in the script. Offered a horse to ride, instead of a carriage, Holmes remarks, 'The animals are dangerous at both ends and devious in the middle.' There are some other good one liners but I forget them at the moment.You know the Sherlock Holmes series from Universal Studios -- the ones with Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce? They were cheap, simple, spooky, and bloodless. Well, this is everything that series was not.It rushes headlong through its narrative -- something to do with Moriarty wanting to start a World War because he's acquiring the rights to all the weaponry. And this movie has weaponry enough to satisfy weaponry fans, and sometimes described in loving detail. One of them appears to be an assault rifle that cycle at about the same rate as a Tommy gun. This is the 1890s and there is a Gatling gun too, but forget that one. It doesn't shoot enough bullets fast enough. The dynamic duo undergo all sorts of travails that I won't bother to spell out. I will, though, mention that the action scenes are edited at a lightning pace except when they are reduced to near-absolute minimum motion. Not slow motion, but hardly any motion at all. Things explode in fireballs several times. Computer-generated images abound. And almost every scene takes place in an eerie and unworldly murk, as if shot underwater in the Harlem River.Does Sherlock Holmes ever exercise his deductive powers? Indeed he does. But he never quite explains them in any detail. Instead, the movie borrows from Law and Order: Crime Scene Unit or whatever it's called. The explanation is zipped through with such alacrity that the viewer is left gaping at the flashing images.It's full of action, adventure, and mystery. I thought it was a travesty.",5,3,4,2 March 2013
The Monuments Men," Big Movie.
","Nice cast in a splashy movie about a group of American officers and men trying to prevent the Germans from absconding with all the art treasures of France during the last months of the war.It's uneven and kind of derivative. In the last scenes, the heavies are not the Nazis. The war is over. But the Russian 'Trophy Brigade' fills the gap and there is a lot of cross-cutting between the ugly, advancing Russians and the GIs trying to drive away with the loot before the Russians arrive.The general theme is probably from 'The Train', or maybe from Clooney's 'Three Kings;' the idea of a group of comrades of disparate backgrounds resembles the Frank Sinatra movies with the Rat Pack; and a scene mourning the death of a friend, while the ironic 'Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas' is sung in the background by somebody who sounds like Judy Garland, first appeared in 'The Victors.' No one really has a chance to display any acting chops. Clooney can be pretty good in the right role. His humor is dead pan. John Goodman, ditto; he was great in the Cohen's 'Barton Fink.' Matt Damon distinguished himself in a number of films. Bob Balaban is reliable, either as villain or as, here, a mousy Jewish professor. The best performance is given by Cate Blanchett, as a French resistance fighter. Maybe an award should be given to Holger Handtke as the Nazi officer who manages to maintain an expression that might have been carved in marble while he orders people about or is insulted while a prisoner. Also he resembles Michael Moriarty.It's not a bad film, though I must say the musical score really sucks. It's just that it alternates clumsily between the wisecracking shenanigans of 'Kelly's Heroes' and something resembling drama. Each opposition seems to drain much of the life out of the other.Michelangelo's 'Madonna and Child,' treated as the summum bonum of fine art, is worth drooling over. It's a fine, beautiful, and innovative piece of work. The Germans did in fact get it out to Germany and it was found considerably later and brought back to Bruges, where it now sits behind a shield of bulletproof glass so that no maniac attacks it with a hammer, as happened to Michelangelo's 'Pieta.'",6,0,0,30 December 2014
Lucky Number Slevin," Shadow Lives.
","It's hard to judge this movie because, in a fundamental way, it's really two movies -- one a casual look at mistaken identity out of 'North By Northwest' -- the other a complicated story of murder and revenge, out of 'The Usual Suspects.' The performances are excellent with a few exceptions. One of the exceptions is Josh Hartnett, on whom the momentum of the story depends. He's inoffensive as the ordinary young guy mistaken for somebody who owes high-echelon gangsters a load of money, but he's something of an embarrassment as the bitter and sadistic killer of the climax.Morgan Freeman and Ben Kingsley are opposite numbers at the top of the racketeering business, and both are superb. Both are highly respected actors and here they get to show why. Freeman's two black goons are convincing as well, but Kingsley's are not. Kingsley is a rabbi. His goons are orthodox Jews and orthodox Jews are simply not menacing, even when they punch you out. Kingsley is hilarious in the penultimate scene. He's strapped into a chair and his killer is explaining why he must die. Kingsley is desperate to talk his way out of this inconvenient situation. He haggles in whispers. He tries gallantly to gesture with his arms and hands but he can't because they're taped to the arms of his chair.It sounds a bit like a joke so far, and for the most part it is, despite the broken nose and the punches in the stomach.The direction owes something to the Coen brothers, and if you have to owe something, the Coens are much better than Freeman or Rabbi Shlomo. Art direction should also take a bow. Lots of imagination has been expended on the set dressing. The screenplay is fine, the dialog has some nice exchanges and wisecracks, until the end, when it changes from 'A Midsummer Night's Dream' to something more like 'Reservoir Dogs.' That ending, and Josh Hartnett's light weight performance, keep it from being the thoroughly enjoyable parody of high-end crime that it might have been.",6,1,2,6 April 2016
Requiem for a Dream," Innovative, Wow.
","The story of four people who get too much into drugs, it poses several questions, not all of them about drugs.  One of them is, how stylized can movies become before they are so thoroughly stylized that they lose their narrative roots?  It's rather like music in some respects.  At one end of the dimension, which I won't try to name, there is a simple tune like, oh, 'Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star,' which is easy to remember, fun to whistle, cute, and rudimentary (although Mozart did some very odd things with it). At the other, three minutes and some seconds of silence.  In movies, at the simple end, we can have, say, a one-hour film consisting of nothing but the same shot of the Empire State Building.  At the other end of the dimension we might get something resembling what one sees in a kaleidoscope while stoned.  (Or maybe we come back to the Empire State Building; maybe it's not a dimension at all, but a circle.)This one certainly hasn't lost touch with the events it describes but it's pretty highly stylized too, as far as the direction, photography, editing, and sound are concerned.  Sometimes this stylization works to support the narrative and sometimes it doesn.  Sometimes it actually works against it. Example:  all of the drugged-up scenes are in fast motion, including those involving, not just speed, but marijuana and heroin.  The hyped-up action we get while Ellen Burstyn is on diet pills is evocative, peppy, full of accelerated business.  But heroin doesn't work that way.  And marijuana practically ablates one's sense of the passage of time so that, for instance, it sometimes seems to take half an hour to urinate -- so they tell me.  If you stop using speed abruptly you can get some wizard hallucinations.  But no one hallucinates on heroin, although this film suggests they do.  The result is that the stylization is sometimes over the top, not slowing down enough to give us a chance to take a breath.  It's nerve jangling and leaves the viewer a neural shambles.  The performances are fine, by everyone concerned.  In particular, Jennifer Connoley has by far her juiciest role and, somewhat surprisingly, is up to it.  Burstyn is excellent too, her accent pretty well Brooklynized.  But some of that shredding of sensibilities is unearned and unnecessary.  The editing is increasingly jumpy and shocking, though it never leaves us in doubt of where we are or who we are with.  The score is a blend of mostly scratchy, unpleasant electronics and ordinary sounds with the gain on high -- each pill accompanied by a 'plop' on the sound track, each flick on a lighter by a 'pfft,' and so on.  (Sometimes it sounds like a Popeye cartoon.)  The photography too is highly distinctive.  Fisheye lenses abound here. Cameras are fixed by harness onto an actor's body so that the actor's face and shoulders are immobile while the background seems to swivel around him and he walks and turns corners.  The effect is so disturbing that it keeps your eyes glued to the screen.I found Aranovsky's earlier film, Pi, plan irritating and depressing because of the high-contrast photography and other directorially imposed effects. This one is depressing too, but less irritating because, despite the high style, a story is being carried, and the story is about characters we care something about.  They may be self absorbed, like the subject of 'Pi,' but they're hardly self confident.  Their weaknesses are pathetic but entirely recognizable.  Ellen Burstyn wants to lose weight so she can look good in that red dress, just as she did at her son's graduation.  She pursues the cultural ideal of slenderness and youthfulness.  Her son and his pardners in euphoria pursue the cultural ideal of pleasuring one's self.  The drugs could be a neat stand in for the values that prevail in our community currently.  Why else, except out of a desire to look good, would people buy a three-hundred-dollar simulacrum of a rowboat and use it so regularly? Why else, except out of a desire to feel pleased with one's self, would anyone buy a forty-thousand-dollar ten-gallon-per-mile Suburban Assault Vehicle with a revolving machine gun turret atop it?  Hey!  Look at me, everybody, I'm young, beautiful, and happy!  Of course I can't figure out why I'm alive, but I don't ask myself that question.This is an extremely innovative film, but the director has made clear his admiration of earlier movies, including 'The Panic in Needle Park' (the same general idea), 'The Godfather' (ominous oranges), 'The Little Shop of Horrors' ('Feed me, Sara!'), and maybe 'Koyaanisqatsi' (the acceleration of the cuts, tempo, and onscreen movements from moderato at the beginning to molto agitato towards the end).It left me saddened and panting for breath.  I'm not sure I'd like to sit through it too often, but I certainly wouldn't have wanted to miss it.",Null,13,21,22 February 2003
Captain Phillips," Dangerous Sea.
","The title is accurate; the docudrama is about Captain Richard Phillips, whose huge American cargo ship was boarded by four teen-aged Somali pirates in 2009. Phillips himself was taken hostage and kept aboard the Maersk Albama's lifeboat, to be held for millions of dollars in ransom. It didn't work. The five men were crowded into the fiberglass lifeboat for a day or two. The US Navy intervened. The pirate chieftain was taken prisoners, the others shot by Navy Seals, and Phillips was released.It gets off to a rather sluggish start, ahead dead slow, except that no Master issues orders like that anymore. Our first views of the Maersk Alabama drain all the romance from our fantasies about life at sea. First of all, the ship is so long and so tall that when it's in port you can't identify it as a ship. It looks like a city, an industrial city. Second, there is no glamor on the bridge. No messenger stands by; no one at the engine controls; there's no one at the helm -- there's no HELM. The ship is all computerized. You want to change course? You push a button. Where did it all go? (Sob.) As the ship's master, Tom Hanks does a decent job, brisk, efficient, calm in the face of troubled waters -- until the last few minutes, when he lets loose. He's had gun muzzles at his temple, his forehead, and his throat, and he's been whacked several times with rifle butts and been beaten with fists. He's had blood splattered all over him. After the lifeboat is recovered, Hanks is taken to the sick bay on the destroyer Bainbridge, where he's checked out and treated by a female CPO. Hanks is so shaken he can barely speak. The CPO has no such problem. She can't shut up. 'Are you okay? You don't look okay? Are you okay? Does this hurt?' There's no chance for Hanks to respond, nor is any response expected. And, while still examining the shocked Hanks, she addresses comments to her assistant in the usual detached tone of a medical provider who is describing an assemblage of organs. Soothingly to Hanks: 'You're okay now. Just relax.' In clipped, efficient tones to the assistant: 'Laceration on the right temple.' Very nice scenes of ships at sea, depictions of devices to repel boarders that I'd never dreamed of, and a convincing picture of the discomfort of being aboard an unventilated lifeboat of shallow draft, bouncing around in the ocean, throwing bodies to and fro, banging their heads against the bulkheads. And no sentimental flashbacks to Phillip's dreamy life at home -- the loving wife, the happy children, the rose-covered cottage in the vale. Like Phillips, the movie is all business.The movie has a tougher time with the pirates. They could have made off safely with thirty thousand dollars but decided to take a hostage and demands thirty million. So how do you handle these guys? Their looks are so strikingly exotic that it's hard to tell one from another. Yet the story must differentiate them somehow. The pirate who is most nearly sympathetic to Hanks looks a little younger than the others. They were evidently all in their teens, the youngest perhaps fifteen, but they all look older than that. The pirate chief is given some cynical remarks about Hanks' naivté, and he wants above all to go to America. He's the one who's captured, not killed, and he gets his wish -- thirty-three years' worth.There are still some puzzles about the film, though it was based on an 'as-told-to' book by Phillips himself. I got the number of pirates mixed up. Maybe that's just the result of a mini-stroke. And I don't understand why a destroyer's bridge should be lighted with blue instead of red, a pretty cavalier treatment of the Purkinje effect. We barely see the members of Seal Team Six, and we don't know what their protocol is. 'Two targets red -- one green, one fuschia.' And if the movie needed a touch of humor, we could at least have heard the most prominent radio talk show pundit in America, describing the pirates as 'just a couple of scared kids trying to get home', a real-life interpretation of the event. Yes, he actually said it.",8,1,3,8 December 2014
3:10 to Yuma," Remake
","There are so many remakes and imitations on the screen these days that I'm tempted to borrow a line from a thirty-year-old movie myself and remark that if the MBAs who greenlight these projects had an original thought it would die of loneliness.The original was a modest black-and-white Western of relatively low budget and a more or less satisfying 1950s ending. The poor rancher (Van Heflin then, Christian Bale now) gets to successfully deliver his carefree prisoner (Glen Ford then, Russell Crowe now) to the train on time and collects the money that will save his ranch.This rifacimento isn't badly done but it's gargantuan by comparison. It's updated. Currently, the word 'updated' can only mean more brutal, sexier, bloodier, sadistic, muddier, dirtier, and characterized by filthier language. All the modern conventions are adhered to.Gone are the familiar studio back lots. Gone are the sunny days of dusty streets at the imitation ranches outside of Los Angeles. This was shot in northern New Mexico in the winter and it looks it. Everyone seems cold, dirty, and grim.Again, that's not necessarily bad news. The historic Old West, though probably nothing much like this, probably resembled the remake more than the original.But, unpretentious as the original was, I think I prefer it. There was only one deliberate murder in the original, and a fairly gruesome one. A hapless helper is hanged by the neck in the hotel lobby. We don't see the lynching but the image of the abject body is startling. This one has multiple killings -- more than I could count, since I have only ten fingers, not counting the extra pinky, and can no longer reach my toes. Russell Crowe is a convincing enough chief heavy but lacks the fake charm that allows Glen Ford to talk barmaid Felicia Farr into bed.Crowe has only to say a few words to Farr's replacement, Vinessa Shaw, before the cut to the bedroom scene, giving the viewer a chance to ogle her nude body, which, as a matter of fact, is worth an ogle or two.Ford kills nobody but here Crowe murders two of his captives. In one case he creeps up on a sleeping figure and stabs him in the chest with a stolen fork -- whap whap whap whap. It's kind of disgusting. It projects the sense that the producers were pandering to an audience of violence-hungry kids who must have their periodic fix. The original was all tension. This one is tense enough, but the bloodletting seems designed to make us sigh with relief. At last, some gore after all that talk.The original ended with Heflin getting Ford on the 3:10 to Yuma Territorial Prison (which is still there and can be visited). A Hollywood ending, one might say. This one finishes with the rancher being plugged full of holes by one of Crowe's gang, then dying in the arms of his teenaged son. Looking down at Bale's dying body, Crowe has a ludicrous epiphany, draws his gun, whirls around, and instantly kills off the gang that has just saved him from the rope, one by one. Unlike the original, the remake must end, as it started, with a cascade of gore. Then Crowe turns the whole movie into self parody by jumping aboard the train to Yuma and climbing into the barred cell. There has never been a hint of remorse in his attitude before, nothing but deadpan stoicism, so this comes as a complete surprise. Yet, although the climax must be bloody, the producers don't want the bad guy to go free, so at least a part of the old Hollywood ending is retained after all -- even if it must be forced onto the narrative like a one-size-fits-all sock that doesn't fit.What will they come up with next? How about Roy Rogers' 'Son of Trigger,' only with Keanu Reeves, and this time we kill Trigger and then eat him. It will probably make a nickel or two. Is the portfolio of Hollywood's ideas completely bankrupt? It's a legitimate question.",5,3,4,19 June 2009
The Equalizer," Toe to Toe With the Russkies!
","I've been trying to figure out the difference between action heroes like Denzel Washington here or Matt Damon in the Bourne franchise and Superman -- I mean Clark Kent's Superman. It's not always easy. They're always 'mild mannered' until their latent identity is triggered. None of them ever seems to lose a battle or be seriously wounded. And they may not have X-ray vision but here the camera takes us inside Washington's eyeball and quick cuts show us the details of his surroundings that he's noticing.Washington is another lightning-fast killer with a hidden identity. Just trying to get along in a huge Home Depot warehouse. But these damned Russian pimps and mobsters keep getting in his way, clobbering his friends, investigating him, and generally making nuisances of themselves. And, man, are they UGLY -- hawk-nosed, covered in inscrutable, tattoos, and with complexions like a relief map of Afghanistan. Always sneering. Washington begins to push back, wiping out six alert armed men in twenty seconds, as if he'd choreographed the dance.The Russians in turn call in their expert hit man, Marton Csokas, who may be the best performer in the movie in that he's able to segue between his two expressions -- a smile and a sneer. He kills and maims brutally.No matter that he's the best there is. Washington kills him too, blows up some of the Russian mafia's oil tankers because -- well, just because -- and then tracks down the capo de tutti capi in Moscow and eliminates him. End of Russian mobsters in America, and freedom for all the young girls they've been running. Americans can breathe free again.If you like the Bourne franchise you'll like this move because it's a close imitation. I thought that -- for what it was -- it was almost ruined by directorial excess. The camera doesn't wobble too much, thank God, but Fuqua seems intent on calling attention to himself as director. Some of the shots are plain pointless. If Washington prepares a cup of tea, we must follow the teabag and watch it dip into the steaming water. If a kitchen faucet is leaking slightly, the camera is position in the basin of the sink, looking UPWARD at the spout, as a drop of water forms and drips down. The explosive fireballs are in slow motion because they cost a lot of money.It could have been better. The opening scenes in a kind of New York 'Nighthawks' cafe are engaging but we don't have to wait long before Clark Kent sheds his drab civilian clothes and emerges in all his majesty to kill the bad guys.",6,2,2,3 September 2016
War Dogs," Arms and the Men.
","Miles Teller, who looks and sounds a bit like John Cusack, is a nice Jewish young man, just trying to get along in Miami by giving massages and selling first-class sheets to the many old age homes. His wife, Ana de Armas, doesn't really care. But Miles' life course is full of bumps. He meets an old high school friend, plump Jonah Hill, who involves him in a money-making scheme selling armaments and ammunition to the US Army. Maybe some others. I was lost from time to time.Well, I'll tell you, the money rolls in. It rolls in in barrels, visible even through the cloud of smoke from all the weed they do. There are cascades of one hundred dollar bills. They drive Porches. And all those thousands of first-class sheets of Egyptian cotton that Miles had bought? He and Hill make a mountain of those boxes and jubilantly set fire to them. Their arms empire grows. It expands from two ambitious guys to a vast international group of shady characters. The flow chart turns murky. What the shady characters are doing is outside the box but apparently legal enough, though dangerous. Then they discover that some AK-47 ammunition, left over in Albania from the Cold War, was made in China. It's illegal to sell Chinese-made ammunition to the US Army. So they set about anxiously repackaging the millions of dollars worth of ammo, from heavy wooden crates to fiberboard boxes, which gets rid of the Chinese ideograms on the wooden boxes.But somebody squeals and one by one the organization is taken down by the FBI.This sound a little complicated, and it is, but we're helped along by Miles Teller's matter-of-fact narration. He tells us what's going on every step of the way, often during a freeze frame. There are overhead shots. There are vicious arguments with the wife. Hill, who is the springboard for all this chicanery, turns out to be a perfidious boss. There is judicious use of contemporary pop music from the likes of Crosby, Stills, and Nash. The deployment of cuss words is unfettered. One of Jonah Hills' previous performances was in 'The Wolf of Wall Street.' This could easily have been directed by Martin Scorsese. In fact, if you didn't know it wasn't, you might think it was. Perhaps it most closely resembles 'Casino', with Jonah Hill in the Joe Pesci part -- the guy who just pushed a good thing too far. The structure also owes a lot to Scorsese's 'Goodfellows', with Miles being taken up into illegal activities while explaining in the narration exactly how it works. One might call the movie 'The Wolf of Albania.' That's not bad. If you're going to steal from someone, steal from the best. And there are funny moments. Miles Teller and Jonah Hill are about to have an extremely important meeting with some US officials regarding a huge arms deal. The meeting will take place on the upper floor of a huge office building. They're nervous so they decide to get stoned before the tête-a-tête and they approach the meeting half wrecked. The duo walk down a long hall, their footsteps clicking loudly on the stone floor. Hill stops. 'Wait a minute. Does it sound to you like there are other people in this hall?' Miles replies, 'Yes.' Okay, satisfied, they begin walking again.It may be imitation Scorsese but it's a good imitation. Brian De Palma's near constant imitation of Alfred Hitchcock became an irritation after a while, but as long as director Todd Phillips finds his own vision, sooner or later, I don't care. I enjoyed the hell out of it.",7,0,0,29 July 2017
The Young Victoria," Splendidly Done Historical Romance.
","Emily Blunt is Victoria who, when her uncle dies, succeeds to the throne. Everyone figures her to be a passive leader. After all, she's just a kid, has no experience, and is a woman to boot.Various august personages are vying for influence over her. Now, if this were an ill-considered movie, we'd have a robust feminist figure dressing down the Old Boy network and taking charge in no uncertain way.But this is a a more savvy story than that. She's no will o' the wisp when it comes to decision making and even temper. She can throw a childish fit. But she needs a man, just as men of that stature need a wife, and she finds him in one of her less aggressive suitors, Prince Albert of Saxony, Coberg, and Ruritania. And, no, we don't get to see Prince Albert go to the can.It's different from what you'd expect and its informative. (I, for one, never knew that Albert was shot in an assassination attempt.) Ordinarily, This kind of biopic takes us through to the inevitable end. As Ernest Hemingway once observed, every love story is a tragedy because at the end one of the lovers dies.NOT HERE. We don't even follow Victoria and Albert into old age, just the first couple of years of their marriage. The last shot is of the two of them in bed, the smiling queen gently hugging the heroic Prince Consort or whatever he was. Their futures and their ends are given in a printed epilogue.I liked it. Okay, so it ends happily instead of tragically, but these days, who needs more tragedy in his life? The location film is superlative. It will make you rufous with envy. It will coagulate your eyeballs. The ladies costumes are suitably muted but the men in uniform wear outrageous colors. Out of uniform they wear black suits with stylishly skinny shoulders. Most of the interiors have so many paintings they resemble the Louvre except for the dining rooms. They're all framed, tinged, and imbued with gilt and appointed with Louis XIV furniture and resemble Donald Trump's suite at Trump Towers.Emily Blunt is a professional and convincing actress -- and in fact all the performances are at least adequate. She's also quietly pretty. It's not high drama, to be sure, but, again, I don't think I could take much more high drama without stroking out. It's a velvety narrative of romance and the exercise of power. You'll probably not be bored.",7,2,2,6 November 2016
Catch Me If You Can," Should have caught him sooner.
","These sorts of psychopaths are always interesting figures, one of the reasons stories and films about them keep appearing on a regular basis. (Tony Curtis did a nice number in 'The Imposter'.) The guys can charm the pants off you. They tend to be bright and handsome, or at least well groomed. And they run into situations that are bound to be comic. All the ingredients are there for an engaging flick.Maybe one of the reasons we are fascinated by them is that we envy them. Here are people who are reasonably smart, who keep themselves clean, have decent manners, and in many ways resemble the rest of us except for one thing -- they lack anxiety. Well, anxiety of a particular sort, the kind that is sometimes called 'responsibility,' 'conscience' or, if you want to stretch it, 'superego.' Any of us could learn how to pass for a lawyer by watching Perry Mason reruns for a couple of weeks. We could perhaps even pass the bar exam with a few weeks of dedicated study. We could all be doctors too, if being a doctor meant nothing more than strolling around in a lab coat with a stethoscope hanging around our necks and never having to perform a laparotomy. But we can't do it because we've been conditioned in such a way that we would be betrayed by our own anxiety.DeCaprio is able to do it here, in this nicely directed Spielberg movie, with the help of his victims. The help comes in the form that sociologists call 'normalization.' We live our lives according to generally recognized scripts. If we do something it calls for a certain kind of response from the people around us. (Eg., what does the script call for next when we say to someone, 'How are you'?) The mistakes we inevitably make are reinterpreted by others so that they seem to follow the script. DeCaprio as a doctor is called in unexpectedly to treat a patient in the ER. 'Bicycle accident,' says one of the other physicians. 'Do you concur?' he asks the others one by one. They concur. 'Carry on then,' he tells them and leaves and they make up a good reason for his behavior. Most of the movie is played for laughs, as Williams' light-hearted semi-fantasy theme tells us. And it has its amusing moments. DeCaprio has seduced a girl and is on the brink of marrying her when he blurts out the truth -- 'I'm not a doctor, I'm not a Lutheran, I never went to Harvard, and I'm not a lawyer.' Her jaw drops and she says, 'You're not a LUTHERAN?' A scam in which DeCaprio chooses eight pretty young girls to play stewardesses and distract attention from him is staged like a Miss America contest. There are some dramatic moments too in which the film and the score, as manipulative as the DeCaprio character, practically begs you to feel sympathy for the guy. It stops just short of ripping open your thorax, reaching inside, and playing 'Hearts and Flowers' on your heartstrings.But it all leaves a kind of sour aftertaste if you give it any thought at all. Here is DeCaprio. Strutting around in his faux Pan Am pilot's uniform, or his doctor's clothes, a multimillionaire after hanging all this bad paper, all the women adoring him for being something he isn't, sprung from jail after a few years for a cushy job with the FBI, writing a book about his crimes, selling the rights to Hollywood. Fine for him, but he has cost the rest of us a good deal. These financial shenanigans alone must have boosted the banks' insurance rates, which means their operating expenses went up, which means the rates they charge us for their services went up, which means we all contributed our little bit to the 4.1 million dollar pot that DeCaprio's character has accumulated. And that's not counting the heartbreak he leaves behind. (Eg., once he dumps his girlfriend she disappears from the movie. She's portrayed as stupid, homely, and shallow. But she's as human as DeCaprio. How, exactly, did she feel about the whole affair?)It seems unfair somehow that people like this should be celebrated at our expense, just because we have consciences and they don't. When a guy cuts in front of you in line it's a selfish act, and it doesn't matter whether he's charming or not. He's putting everybody else one place back and hasn't earned his position. It's sorry enough in real life. That the movie should celebrate the facts of DeCaprio's contempt and our own foolishness is really inexcusable.",Null,4,9,15 December 2003
Marie Antoinette," Boy, Did They Eat Cake.
","The film has a fine cast and there are some original touches. The American actors speak unaccented English, without as much as a nod to any alien phones, for instance, despite the late 18th-century French setting. And there may be snatches of rococo music but most of the score is electronically amplified rock with, at one point, a singer belting out the old Frank Sinatra standard, 'Fools Rush In.' There are multiple close ups of lavish plates of exquisitely prepared and presented food. And minute examination of clothing, wigs, fabrics, jewelry, and period shoes -- especially shoes. (The hairdresser who dolls up Kirsten Dunst as Marie Antoinette is a fairy and is played for laughs.) Miniature dogs. Lots of miniature dogs slurping up charlotte russes or other desserts.Okay -- decadence in abundance. It might have taken ten minutes. Instead, that's what the entire film seems to be about.You have to applaud the director's intent to do something different, something original. The problem is that it doesn't work. Rip Torn's speech doesn't sound too much out of place but most of the rest of the women sound like Valley Girls. And, boy, they gossip! In extended scenes, they gossip! They talk behind one another's back about hair styles and personalities -- 'She's so political.' Stuff you could find on MySpace.It wouldn't take much in the way of rewriting to turn this story of self-indulgent aristos at Versailles into a handful of high school kids in El Cerrito. And it didn't need to be directed by Sophia Coppola. Martha Stewart could have phoned it in while under house arrest.I don't know which audience this was aimed at, but I can recommend it for selected groups anyway. Those youngsters who, in a recent poll, identified Toronto as a city in Italy, for example. Or the fourteen percent of us who believe Barack Obama is a Muslim. Or that majority of high school seniors unable to place the American Civil War in its correct half century. At least they'd gain some familiarity with the dress of the period French court.",3,31,46,10 April 2008
Child 44," Sowiet Union Not Havink Serial Killer!
","A flawed film, more or less based on the case of Chikotilo, the notorious serial killer who notched up several dozen children, some after terrible torture.It's interesting to compare the HBO docudrama, 'Citizen X', with this fictional feature film. The first was measured in its pace and splendidly acted by the droopy faced Steven Rhea and his superior, Donald Sutherland. It stuck closely to the historical facts as documented in the well-informed case study, 'The Killer Department,' by Robert Cullen. The dissolution of the dilatory and obstructionist USSR is clearly shown but with some subtlety.In my review I described 'Citizen X' as a serial killer movie made for adults. 'Child 44' isn't without its moments. It's well-directed and the performance's are adequate, with Tom Hardy's relentless investigator and Joel Kinnaman as the handsome and utterly ruthless NKVD operator outstanding.Yet 'Child 44' can't be described as a serial killer movie for adults. It's been alloyed with the current taste for darkness and bone-crushing violence.The plot is what the real participants might have called 'gloopy.' There is some wild crap introduced showing that the killer spent time in a Nazi prison where he was injected with a serum -- or let's call it a potient -- that rendered him hungry for human flesh. Where did such an explanation come from? Whose was the hand that slanted back that brow? The whole movie is overwrought and lacks verisimilitude. Tom Hardy gets his brains beaten out and two minutes later he's clobbering three bald, armed NKVD goons, each the size of Boulder Dam.Part of the story has been turned into domestic drama. I don't mind a come-and-go romance being in the story. In 'Citizen X', the investigator had his plump Russian zhbena, but here he has a lengthy, twisted relationship with his wife who is not (thank Bog) a stunning and glamorous modelesque type.The film shows the USSR to be a dark, dreary, threatening place. Every scene seems to be filled with grimy warehouses and pipes. It's so ashen that it brings to mind Fitzgerald's phantasmal description of the city of ashes in 'Gatsby.' There's never a ray of sunshine.It's very plainly anti-Russian propaganda. We will never get over the Cold War, it seems. But, like 'Citizen X', it does capture the demeaning nature of communism. You're assigned to a particular apartment, for instance, and in both films people are eager to get a larger and more comfortable place to live. What a shabby existence. No wonder it finally fell apart. It ought to give us pause when we call an American public figure a 'communist.' Nobody wants that.",3,0,2,10 January 2016
The Ring," Carnival of Scares.
","I didn't get to the end of this shock fest. Naomi Watts investigates an exceedingly strange videotape. Her friends are indifferent to her unease. A close examination of the tape, which seems to curse its viewers, reveals a connection to an Anna Morgan whose ranch full of prize horses appears to have died of some unfathomable epidemic on the beach and -- that's about where I left.Possibly the climax revealed all and was done in a way that fascinated viewers as much as that bizarre VHS did, but I wouldn't know. A couple of elements were turn offs.One is that it was filmed in a way that saturated the images -- ALL the images -- with a familiar ghoulish green. It's the color of a comic-book Zombie. Man, is that tiresome.Another is that if the film managed to avoid a horror story cliché, I must have missed it. Watts enters a room accompanied by spooky music, sees the back of the baby sitter's body sitting stiffly upright in a chair, approaches the chair and occupant, reaches her hand out to touch the apparently lifeless shoulder -- and the baby sitter shrieks, having only been asleep. Watts has a frightening dream, wakes up and thrusts her open-mouthed face into the camera lens, her eyes bulging, her chest panting. The experienced viewer pendiculates.I could see the plot developing in accordance with the usual textbook rules though. The shocks at first are minor, then grow more grotesque. The first truly bizarre experience that Naomi Watts has comes during one of her many playbacks of the tape. She stops it, zooms in on a fly that always has appeared in one corner of the screen, reaches tentatively towards it and then picks it out of the image, alive. Then what does she do? She's distracted and apparently releases the fly deliberately, uninterested in learning more about it. I'd have had it in a jar pronto and taken it to the nearest entomologist for a closer look at this mysterious mouche.Next up the scale, she's on the phone and begins coughing and hacks up a long string of what appears to be twined human hair, maybe a yard long, with some kind of small plastic device on the end of it. The object, whatever it is, shares the destiny of that fly. Nothing more is heard of it. The entire incident is immediately forgotten by Watts and dropped from the story.I noted before that when Naomi Watts wakes from a bad dream she sits upright and thrusts her open-mouthed face into the lens. That mouth almost saves the picture. In a movie full of dark shadows, rain, dampness, and green, Watt's two incisors are the only things that glisten. My God, those incisors belong on Bugs Bunny. I was in their thrall throughout. In some inexplicable way they add to Watts' delicate blond beauty. Talk about mysteries! That's about it. Naturally nobody believes Watts and her friends are helpless and any witnesses don't like to talk about the past and her child is in jeopardy and blah blah blah. I wonder what the original was like.",5,0,2,17 January 2011
Raiders of the Lost Ark," Conception of a Series.
","Original, exciting, and lots of fun. Spielberg directed it and Kasdan and Lucas wrote it. Without it, we wouldn't have had 'Romancing the Stone', 'The Jewel of the Nile,' 'The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Empire', and many others too numerous to list. They were all more or less rip offs of this one. Of course the original was highly successful. I dragged my lugubrious ex to the theater and even SHE enjoyed it. For a while there was an attempt to merchandise Indiana Jones' leather jackets, fedoras, and bull whips but they didn't get far.The fact that this was such a commercial blockbuster raised the inevitable question, which may be roughly phrased as, 'What do I do NOW, Ma?' What you do is produce sequels: 'Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom,' 'Indiana Jones and the Amazon Women of the Moon,' and so on. Each imitation, each sequel, was less innovative and more desperate and sloppy, but that's in the nature of decadence.Harrison Ford, whose career this put the stamp of approval on, is an archaeologist who is recruited to find the Ark of the Covenant hidden somewhere in the Middle East. It's 1936 and the Nazis are after it and who knows what havoc they might wreak with its powers? Jones drags along Karen Allen, a former lover and assistant, to provide a pulchritudinous sidekick with whom he can exchange insults. Anything resembling sex is out of the question, though, just as it would never have been considered in one of the 1930s Saturday afternoon theater serials on which this kind of story is based.Here's the schematic diagram of the plot: Introduction, suspense, action, suspense, action, suspense . . . n. Then the climax -- a really BIG action scene.But the thing that made it successful and keeps it so enjoyable after thirty years is that the action wasn't of the usual sort. Oh, sure, Jones and his girl friend are threatened with immanent death lots of times -- involved in comic fist fights, shot at with poisoned arrows. That's de rigeur. But how often does a hero find himself dashing through an underground tunnel downhill pursued by a three-ton rolling marble? Another element that contributed to its appeal was its reconstruction of the period, 1936. The exotic settings of 1936 aren't just rebuilt. They're lovingly reproduced. The ordinary set dressings are there to suggest the exotic -- always look for beaded curtains -- but the men don't waltz around in immaculate double-breasted white suits and pith helmets. The settings are overblown, to be sure. I strongly doubt that in all of Nepal there was a saloon with the size and atmosphere of Karen Allen's. I'm not at all sure there were ANY saloons in Nepal in 1936. But they're meant to suggest authenticity, not embody it, and they succeed in an creative way.Finally, the characters are kind of enjoyable in themselves, from the often frightened and only barely willing Indiana Jones himself, through the cartoon Nazis with the monocles and Swastika armbands. Oh, boy, watch the ark of the covenant MELT them down to nothing while they are frozen in place and screaming! The force unleashed.",7,15,21,9 July 2011
Spartacus," I am not Spartacus.
","Some very impressive shots of Kirk Douglas's army of ex slaves and ex gladiators and their followers sweeping across the Italian countryside like a wave of army ants. This is Stanley Kubrick's first Big Movie. It largely succeeds as entertainment -- complete with Entr'acte -- because its colorful, splashy, and Kubruck is still in touch with his human roots. He was soon to be absorbed by technology as a food particle is absorbed by an amoeba.In brief, Douglas is Spartacus who, in the years before Christ, was a slave trained as a gladiator. He led a revolt and marched his army to Bridisium (now Brindisi) where ships were supposed to be waiting to spirit him and his thousand followers out of the country to freedom. The pirates who were to man the ships were bought out by Spartacus's enemies in Rome, leaving Spartacus trapped between two or three Roman armies led by the nasty and determined patrician Lawrence Olivier. Spartacus's men put up a good fight but they lose and all are crucified. That's why I don't watch the last ten minutes or so. Before his own torture and death, Spartacus is forced to kill the harmless Tony Curtis, his best friend. And when Spartacus is strung up there, his girl friend, Jean Simmons, looks up at him and begs him to die. That, I don't need.In fact, with the exception of two scenes -- the exhilarating rebellion at the gladiator school and the pastoral love scene at the pond between Douglas and Simmons -- it's pretty tragic all around. It's as if John Brown had succeeded in freeing the slaves in the South, then went around looting plantations, having a good time, and causing all sorts of discomfort until, finally, Washington sent the army down, led by Robert E. Lee, and crushed him. I don't know how closely the story matches historical reality but, if I remember, the march to Brindisi wasn't all wine and roses. Spartacus had a falling out with his friend and colleague Crixus and the group split up, didn't they? There's a hilarious conversation between Olivier and his body servant, Curtis, while Olivier is in the bath. It was cut from the first release print but has been restored. 'Do you like oysters?', queries Olivier. 'When I can get them, Master,' replies Curtis, who is tenderly washing Olivier's back. 'Do you like snails?' 'No, Master.' 'You see, it's a matter of taste. I myself enjoy both oysters and snails.' (Something like that.) It's all code for homosexuality, which was not exactly unknown, let alone condemned as immoral, in Ancient Rome. As a matter of fact, without any particular interest in the subject, I noticed among the principals in the cast one who was thoroughly committed to snails, one who apparently enjoyed both snails and oysters, and one who preferred oysters although he'd tried snails at least once. I can't speak for the supporting players or the thousand extras.Douglas does okay by the heroic but unlucky Spartacus. Jean Simmons is a nice lady but, once out of adolescence in Dickens and Shakespeare, she seemed mundane. Woody Strode, of all people, has a marvelous scene. (Strode's character, a gladiator, has hardly any lines.) He's sitting in the bull pen with Douglas. The two men, who are fellow slaves, are about to be forced to fight to the death for the enjoyment of a couple of really slimy aristos. We can hear the clang of swords from the arena outside and the gasps of the crowd. Strode and Douglas don't say a word. Douglas is biting his tongue and staring at Strode, and Strode slowly looks sideways at him with the sweetest, gentlest, most enigmatic smile you can imagine. It only last a minute but it's the best minute that Woody Strode ever committed to celluloid.The winner of tonight's prize of a whole Smithfield ham must be divided between Lord Lawrence Olivier, as the rabid Patrician who wants to be dictator, and Peter Ustinov as the comical and servile brown noser -- 'Oh, yes, whatever you wish, Your Pulchritude.' The two fight like gladiators to upstage one another.According to Kirk Douglas, who was Executive Producer, there was some argument over who should get writing credit on the movie. Dalton Trumbo had, after all, been blacklisted during the McCarthy era. Did they dare give Trumbo screen credit. Maybe not, but then who would get it? Should they invent a fake name? Kubrick, in all seriousness, piped up with, 'Use my name. I'll take the credit.' Douglas was disgusted.The score by Alex North is loud and martial, except for a saccharine love them associated with Spartacus and Varinia, but it's uninspired. I'd have preferred the borscht that was always served up by Dmitri Tiomkin -- those cow bells and flatulent trombones -- but North's score is an improvement over the ominous chords of Miklos Rozsa.It's a decent movie with some fine scenes in it but, Lordy, it's depressing.",7,1,3,16 November 2011
Deepwater Horizon," Watch Out For That Traveling Crown Block!
","I believe one of the producers was Mark Wahlberg, who also stars. Too bad. His writers and his own judgment failed him. When it comes to special visual effects it's possible to go too far -- and they have gone it.The first twenty minutes are kind of interesting. We get to know the characters, like a grizzled Kurt Russel who manages the rig, Wahlberg who is the chief electronic technician, and John Malkovitch, who is not one of the worker ants but rather seems to represent the suits who own the rig, Burns Phillips. It's a little hard to tell. It's a little hard to tell anything about the people or the operations or the rig itself. You see, I am only five years old and I need the pace of the exposition to be slowed down so I can understand the meaning of terms like crack block, feeder pump, boom, operative covering, and cement block. I'm smart, so I figured out p.s.i. all by myself. I never did figure out why some of the jiggling needles on the gauges caused concern while others didn't. Malkovitch is treated as the villain of the piece but I don't know why, since his suggestions sounded sensible enough to me. But then, though I'm smart, my intuitive faculty is impaired.There's a lot of bonhommie aboard the Deepwater Horizon, which floats and isn't set on piles, and which has a bridge from which the screws are operated and all that. It's really a big flat boat. There's even an attractive young lady who works on the bridge. Everybody knows everybody else and there are running gags expressing the extent of Gemeinchaft. It all reminded me of the opening scenes of 'The Perfect Storm' except these blue-collar types are pretty well set. Life aboard one of these rigs is deliberately made pleasant for the crew, otherwise why would they work on them? The cuisine is described in other sources as four star. There's booze available too. Everything is as comfortable as practicable only no smoking.That's the first twenty minutes. The rest is a breathless explosion of CGIs and special visual effects. The wretched drill blows out and we see a gusher of mud and/or oil, which then is ignited and burns eleven men to a crisp, while wounding most of the others. There is no pause. The structure blows up piece by piece with no explanation of what the hell is going on. An hour of solid flame, terror, flying debris, and blood. As a five year old, I loved it. It's hard to imagine what other audience it's aimed at. It's just that even at my tender age it's possible to reach a point of genuine satiation. Of the performances, only one stands out. The bewhiskered Malkovitch is a magnetic Cajun speaking in a memorable dialect.",4,4,6,25 May 2017
Deja Vu," Well-done, tricky, time-travel crime thriller.
","If you should tune in to this film after the first twenty minutes or so, you are likely to be clueless about what happens afterward. It's confusing enough from the beginning. Instead of deja vu (already seen) I finished it with an uncanny feeling of presque vu (almost seen).A special government agency has these satellites, you see, which are able to peer down and capture events in and near New Orleans in incredible detail. Nothing much new there. But the thing is, the picture the agents get is, dig it, four days old! And it's a trailing four day period, meaning that the events they are looking at on their giant TV screen are happening in real time. And as the agents spend their 'present' watching the images, the 'past' they are viewing travels along with them, always four days old.The satellites are not only able to capture any normal images of events in public spaces either. They have 'infra red' capacity that allows them to penetrate buildings and walls and see inside people's apartments and offices. And they pick up the audio as well. Of course this opens up new vistas, which the agents take advantage of by watching the drop-dead gorgeous Paula Patton take a shower.Not wanting to run out of space here, and space is our problem now, not time, although we're assured they're one and the same, I'd better -- wait a minute. It occurs to me that I just spent too much of the space/time continuum explaining why I couldn't spend too much of the space/time continuum. Well, it's all no more confusing than the science and technology we see in this movie.To cut to the chase, a domestic terrorist (James Caviezel) blows up a big ferry, killing any number of people, including the partner of Denzel Washington, who's an ATF agent. When Washington finds out that not only can we view the past but we can also, in some curious way, penetrate it, he insists on being sent back to a few hours before the explosion to see if he can prevent it. (The usual paradox is mentioned in passing, as a joke.) BANG -- and Washington is sent back to a few hours before the blast, and after his Terminator-like trip he immediately rescues the drop-dead gorgeous Paula Patton from certain incineration by the terrorist. He does more than that. He saves the drop-dead gorgeous Paula Patton a second time. He saves the ferry by sacrificing his own life. Or so it would seem, except that he unknowingly shows up at the post-disaster scene, his unknowing 'present' self, where he is introduced for the first time to the drop-dead gorgeous Pamela Patton. I don't know how that works either. If you died in the past, how can you show up alive in the present? For that matter, if your satellite technology can pick up the visual spectrum in the electromagnetic field, plus infra red, how come it can also give you high-definition audio, which is nothing more than waves of differing air pressure? Actually, I happen to know all these answers but the NSA won't let me spill the beans.Denzel Washington is quite good in this most action movie. He doesn't have much in the way of dynamic range but that's okay. Neither did Gary Cooper or Robert Redford. What more can be said about the drop-dead gorgeous Paula Patton except that she has a slinky, sinewy figure and the face of a model, full of good bone structure. And she has a distinctive husky voice too. Her features are slightly, engagingly, askew, as if someone had sliced her face through the sagittal plane and put it back together somewhat carelessly. She's African-American, I suppose, because we all agree that she is. But genetically my guess is that she's about half Caucasian, like Barak Obama and Hallie Berry. A living example of what's called 'the social construction of reality.' She's a decent actress and one hopes she has a career in films, and not just because she's, well, drop-dead gorgeous either.The director, Tony Scott, deserves a comment too. He's done some meretricious work in the past, undeserving of much attention, but this (with one or two exceptional scenes) is nicely executed material. There's a bit too much editorial razzle dazzle in the expository scenes involving the satellites, but that's about it. The action scenes, the special effects, are above what you might expect from a routine action movie. Sometimes they're startling. I hope the stunt people were being paid above scale.This is a film that ought to keep you attentive and in your seat, even if you're not an action movie fan. It's a superior example of a much degraded genre.",7,0,1,24 October 2007
Casablanca," Wartime Drama, Intrigue, Romance in Exotica.
","Since no one reading these comments knows the plot, I'll outline it. Loner Humphrey Bogart runs a shady saloon and gambling house in French Morocco in 1942. The Nazis are closing in. The region is under the government of the French puppet government and is represented by Claude Raines. Bogart is wary of relationships. 'I stick my neck out for nobody.' Into his gin joint walks an old girl friend, Ingrid Bergman, and her husband. They're still in love but Bergman is bonded to her idealistic husband, a resistance hero and concentration camp escapee. Bogart is distraught. A flashback reveals that they were lovers in Paris before it was occupied by the Germans. They kiss often on the screen and it's even suggested that they had premarital intercourse. Bergman finds out that her husband is still alive and deserts Bogart without explanation. The rebuff leaves him shocked -- shocked! Back in the present, in Rick's café in Casablanca, it's revealed that Bogart has two unimpeachable passes out of Casablanca, which Bergman attempts to get from him, for use by her and her hero husband, at the point of a gun. But she can't shoot Bogart. Instead, she collapses in his arms. The scene dissolves. When the next scene fades in they are standing apart and conversing. I suspect another illicit interlude has taken place.In the end, good prevails. Bogart and Bergman sacrifice their love for the greater good.It's practically an icon of 1940s Hollywood. It has a great cast -- Bogart, Bergman, Cuddles Sakal, Claude Raines, Greenstreet and Lorre from 'The Maltese Falcon,' Paul Henreid, John Qualen, Leonid Kinsky, Conrad Veidt from Fritz Lang's 'The Cabinet of Doctor Caligari.' It was probably the high point of Michael Curtiz's career. And it's been applauded by fans from all over the world for almost seventy years.And it's not bad, either. It's just that, to the extent that it eludes my aesthetic apparatus, I guess it's because I find it no more than an interesting but strictly routine tale of the nasty Nazis, the ambiguous French, the heroic European resistance, and the cynical and embittered American who converts to the values of the Free World at the end. Bogart was to play similar roles for the rest of his career. (Cf., 'Key Largo.')The very features of the film that are so consistently pointed to as its greatest assets I find kind of corny. Everybody quotes tag lines. 'The problems of two people don't amount to a hill of beans in this crazy world.' 'Round up the usual suspects.' 'Louie, I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship.' I remember every detail of Paris. The Germans wore gray, you wore blue.' Then there's the scene in which the Free French outsing the Germans. Is that cannon fire or is it myself I hear snoring? The movie is okay for what it purports to be, a strictly commercial, patriotic effort from Warner Brothers. There's nothing to indicate the slapdash quality of the shooting itself. (At one point, Bogart had a scene in which he stood on a balcony nodding at something below, without knowing what the something was supposed to be.) I watch it more out of a sense of duty than any magnetic attraction towards an irresistible film. The schmaltz is frankly irritating. I wince, watching the tears roll down Bergman's gorgeous face, hearing Bogart's repeated, 'Here's looking at you kid.' It would be nice to think that there was more going on than what we see and hear on the surface. Somewhere between the rainy train station in Paris and the colorful desert resorts of Casablanca, couldn't Bogart have come out of the closet? Maybe he and Claude Raines were jealous of one another? Couldn't Bogart have sent Bergman off with her husband because he was more in love with his collection of ladies' undergarments? He found the local goat herds more inspiring?Anything?",5,8,19,2 September 2009
Minority Report," Full of action and suspense, and still dull.
","I'm afraid watching this thing, the images on the screen constantly in motion, the blurry images, the supersonic warp-speed editing, must have fused my synapses. I couldn't get through it. Oh, I enjoyed the score. Always liked Beethoven. But it was much easier to listen to with eyes closed.The performances weren't bad. How can a performance be bad in a plot-driven special-effects loaded action SF flick? Even Max von Sydow, who, I was happy to see, is still working, was perforce animated.Lots of opportunities for exploring issues like, If you can see something coming and you stop it before it comes, how come it still comes? It's the grandfather paradox of future time travel.I really didn't care much about the characters because I didn't get to know anything much about them except that they can run fast and jump from one vertically moving vehicle to another -- the car chase, as it were, in dimension number two, up and down.It seems to me that this movie will be an embarrassment when 2053 rolls around and everything looks and acts pretty much like it does now, in 2007. 'On the Beach' (set in 1964) and '2001: A Space Odyssey' had similar problems. Well, I suppose they weren't BIG problems, but still.Will it really ever be easier to manipulate images by waving your hands like some guy in a demonic Tai Chi frenzy than by tweaking a few dials with your fingertips?",3,4,9,16 July 2007
Lifeboat," Thoughtful and Exciting Drama From Hitchcock.
","This doesn't get much attention and I'm not sure why, because it certainly deserves more. The story of a diverse handful of survivors adrift in the Atlantic after their ship is torpedoed, it represents one of the technical and narrative challenges that Hitchcock at the time was beginning to impose on himself. There's only one set -- the lifeboat -- and how do you give the ten or so people aboard enough to do and say to keep the audience watching? You can't have them almost mowed down by an airplane in the middle of a corn field.Hitchcock and his writers handled the problem deftly. There isn't a dull moment in the film. They fight storms, cut off legs, play cards, get drunk, fall in love, and kill each other.John Steinbeck wrote the treatment and the screenplay was polished off by Jo Swerling. It immediately ran into trouble with the Office of War Information and the Breen Office. The handful of British and American survivors pick up the captain of the U-boat, now sunk, that torpedoed their ship -- good old Willie. Willie proves to be more focused and more able than anyone else in the boat. He's not only a master seaman and navigator but a surgeon as well. He turns out to be cheerful, practical, cherubic, avuncular, perceptive, melodious, charismatic, and murderous. He rows the boat in the general direction of the U-boat's mother ship while he sings German folk songs and the others tootle along, accompanying him on a flute. 'How'm I doing, Willie?', asks the millionaire Henry Hull. The hypermasculine, possibly communist, John Hodiak mocks Hull in a queer voice, 'How'm I doin', Willie?', and then cackles. And why not? After all, everybody in the boat is accompanying Willie.The problem, as the censors saw it, was that Willie was superior to anyone else in the boat and Willie was a Nazi. The fact that Willie was cheating by swigging from a concealed bottle of water, taking vitamin pills, and peeking at a hidden compass was trumped by the obvious fact that he was the only person who knew exactly what he was doing. The Germans could have shown the film throughout Europe as pro-Nazi propaganda.Steinbeck caught most of the heat for this, as he had for an earlier screenplay, 'The Moon is Down,' that humanized a German soldier. Was Steinbeck a crypto-fascist? It's ironic that the question should have been raised because before the war, Steinbeck, the author of such modestly leftist works as 'To a God Unknown' and 'The Grapes of Wrath', was accused of being a Commie.There are a couple of shots that no other director would have employed because no other director would have thought of them, and they're not necessarily dramatic or suspenseful. It's a languorous afternoon on the becalmed sea. Hodiak, his torso mottled with tattoos is reading an old newspaper. We see the newspaper from his point of view. Then a mischievous finger pokes slowly through the page and pulls the paper away, to be replaced by Tallulah Bankhead's seductively smiling face dropping gently backwards onto Hodiak's lap. While they swap back stories, she produces her lipstick and adds another fake tattoo to his chest -- the initials C.P. They're Bankhead's initials, of course, 'Connie Porter', but they also hint at 'Communist Party.' With only a few minor exceptions, the acting is superb. I never found myself under Talullah Bankhead's Magic Spell but if I had to choose an actress to play a spoiled, snobbish, rich bitch it might be her. She seems to belong in that mink coat and she practically owns that smoke-cured voice. In many ways, this is her story. She's progressively stripped of every material possession she uses to define herself, and it's her character that shows the most development. Canada Lee, as the black guy, is a fine actor and has the right face for the part but he's saddled with a stereotypical role. There isn't space to get into all the characters but it's clear that Hitchcock opted for genuine faces instead of glamor pusses in this story. John Hodiak looks like an ordinary stoker, not like Cary Grant. And I mean -- take a look at Hume Cronyn. A face made for radio.You really shouldn't miss this one. It's a lesson in movie-making.",8,3,3,13 June 2008
G.I. Jane," Unwatchable. Well -- Unseeable.
","Maybe you can get through this but I couldn't get past the first 45 minutes. Every scene was too dark. Almost all the scenes took place at night or were shot day-for-night. All of the indoor scenes were shadowy, even in the mess hall, so much so that faces were indistinguishable. Groups of people standing together became homogeneous black masses. When I realized that I was looking forward to the commercial breaks because I could actually SEE them, I gave up.Here's what I got out of the first 45 minutes. Demi Moore is a successful Naval Intelligence officer, a lieutenant who is given a crack at the SEAL training program. She feels she ought to take it because she would be the first woman to complete the program. (She's been denied duty on submarines and in a couple of other positions because they couldn't accommodate women.) She has a conversation about this with her husband in bed, in almost complete darkness, so I can only guess from the conversation that it was her husband because her companion didn't sound like Daffy Duck. She points out that although they've been in the Navy the same amount of time and had similar appointments, he has had a more successful career because he's a man. He doesn't understand her desire to prove herself despite her womanhood. (My heart began to sink somewhere around here.)Well, I kid you not, the training program is really a rough one. They seem to perform all their exercises at night and in the rain. And when the recruits are told they must jump over a series of barriers or something -- I couldn't tell exactly what the obstacles were because I couldn't see them -- she is informed that steps have been provided for her use. She gets up on her hind legs and screams that she doesn't want any special considerations just because she's a woman. The other recruits, by the way, have been acting like testosterone-maddened brutes towards her -- whistling when she enters the mess deck, ogling her rack, shouting out questions to her: 'Don't you know it's rude to point'? I don't know why. Demi Moore isn't unattractive but her voice sounds like tires crunching over a gravel driveway.Enough is enough. Whether or not the photography was bilged, the script seemed well on its way to doing so all on its own. You can imagine how little effort went into picking a title for this politically correct piece -- 'GI Jane.' The writers and the director (who has done admirable work elsewhere) seemed to have worked equally hard on the story. That is to say, not very much. I anticipated that she would not only successfully complete the program but in addition perform some heroic deed -- saving the life of a fellow recruit during an accident or something. There would be a band playing at the end, when the credentials were being handed out, and all the men who had treated her with such condescension would stand at attention when she passed. Her husband would take her in his arms and apologize for having been such an unfeeling moron. I mean, that's the kind of plot a committee of unimaginative writers would come up with and a bunch of MBAs with an eye on the box office would greenlight. It's like one of those connect-the-dots puzzles that are provided on the backs of the menus in some Chinese restaurants to keep the impatient kids occupied, only here, instead of winding up with a pencil drawing of a clown it comes out as a dollar sign.Demi Moore is good at playing a tough cookie with that voice of hers that sounds as if it had been cured by Gauloise. And Vigo Mortenson has the stereotyped role of the harsh Master Chief who is only sadistic in the service of a noble cause. At least I think it was Vigo Mortenson. It may have been Sam Shephard. It was too dark to tell.",3,7,23,25 July 2003
In Bruges," A Tour You Can Learn From.
","What a splendidly executed dramatic comedy about two Irish hit men wandering around the ancient city of Bruges, Belgium. Everything seems to come together, everything synchronized, and the chief credit must go to the writer and director, Martin McDonagh, with myriad plaudits left over for the actors, the photographer, the typically insinuating score by Carter Burwell, and all the other elements of the film.Colin Farrell is a hit man in London. On his first assignment from boss Ralph Fiennes, he shoots a priest and, accidentally, a little boy waiting to make his confession. The guilt haunts him although, aside from the occasional act of putting a pistol to his head and cocking it, it doesn't otherwise seem to interfere with his enjoyment of life.Farrell and another murderer, the plump but perceptive Brendan Gleeson, are sent to Bruges to await a phone call from Fiennes identifying their next target. While sitting around, instead of twiddling their thumbs, they visit the medieval Old City at Gleeson's insistence. Farrell is nervous and impatient, while Gleeson is enthralled by the cathedrals, the canal, and 'The Last Judgment,' a triptych by Heironymous Bosch. It prompts Farrell to observe that Bruges itself might serve as a proper Hell.In fact, it just about does. Gleeson finally receives the long-awaited call from Fiennes, who inquires about Farrell's appreciation of Bruges. Did he visit the cathedral? Yes. Did he see all the paintings? Yes. The canal? Yes, but Gleeson doesn't think that's Farrell's 'thing.' Did he see the swans? Are the swans still there? Yes. (Long pause on the phone.) 'Well then what does he ****ing mean, it's not his ****ing thing?' Fiennes has sent the two of them there intending this trip to be a last present to Farrell, whom Gleeson must now kill for having murdered that young boy, a violation of principle which must be atoned for. In the end, Gleeson refuses. Fiennes himself comes to Bruges to straighten things out and there is a violent climax.The brutality is as gory and realistic as the comedy is funny. The dialog sparkles, and there were some lines and some conversational exchanges that made me laugh out loud. The characters are quirky and interesting in themselves. Farrell gets wildly excited when he sees a movie crew filming a scene with a dwarf. 'There filming MIDGETS!' he exclaims, running to the shoot.This is pretty dangerous territory for a movie, when you get right down to it. You know -- whimsy involving idiosyncratic hit men, a pregnant concierge, a dwarf who complains about how much **** he's had to take from black midgets, cocaine, a Russian arms dealer who wonders if he's using the right word when he talks about 'alcoves', a beautiful young woman who supplies film crews with dope. It's the kind of story that could easily try to coast along on its phantasmic charm. But the plot is strong enough to hold in one channel the divagations into saintly relics and restaurant fist fights with Americans who complain about Europeans blowing cigarette smoke in their direction. That last incident, the one about smoking in a restaurant, is emblematic of the entire film. It's a misunderstanding, and a bloody one. The impulsive Farrell decks the American, Zeljko Ivanek, saying, 'That's for John Lennon, you ****,' only to discover later that the American was a Canadian and that he, Farrell, had made another violent error.Well, I guess I won't go on about it although, to be sure, we're talking about more than just two murderers taking a vacation in Belgium. There are religious undertones -- or, more generally, moral ones -- galore. The logic doesn't always maintain its integrity. (Eg., Farrell is supposed to be eliminated because he accidentally killed a little boy -- but whacking the priest during confession was okay?)I'm not so sure that kids would either understand it or enjoy it but see it when you get a chance.",8,1,4,13 May 2009
John Wick," A Brand New FRANCHISE!
","I don't know how deeply I want to get into this. It's like stepping into a septic tank.So let's keep it short. Keanu Reeves is John Wick, wearing a cloak of ordinariness. Some Russian miscreants insult him at a gas station. That night, they break into his house, beat hell out of him, steal his car, and kill his dog. Well! The beating, yes; the car maybe; but the dog -- NO! His response is first-order change. He knows who dunnit because he just retired from a Special Ops group and he's skilled at martial arts, the use of deadly weapons, and has a talent with macramé. None of these guys with a hidden past ever turns out to have been a busboy or a plumber. Similarly, the bad guys, as here, tend to be either Germans, Russians, or Arabs. We've never quite forgiven the Germans for World War II. Russia was balanced on the fence but now with Putin in charge, a dictator manqué, they seem to be fair game again. I'm certain that in the crepuscular recesses of Hollywood board rooms they are DYING to drag Muslims into the narratives but it wouldn't be PC now, would it? The plot? Oh, the plot. John Wick shoulders his way through a crowded night club where the Russkies hang out and shoots everyone who looks disagreeable. His gun is quick. And he's thorough. One ugly adversary gets three bullets in the abdominal cavity and one in the center of the forehead. The wounded lying on the floor, he shoots and kills more or less in passing, not really paying much attention to them. That's just the first brutal encounter. Several others follow.In between massacres there are a few minutes of metaphysical discourse. 'John, what happened? You and I were colleagues.' 'Yes, but bonds fade with time.' 'Surely some symbolic interactionism persists.' 'Well -- YES AND NO.' 'At least as the systemic level!' 'But not as individual traits.' 'But how can you KNOW that?' 'My epistemological intuition.' (Bang, shoots interlocutor in center of forehead, dead center on the saggital suture.) By the end, Wick has either killed or brought about the death of dozens of men and women. Willem DaFoe dies horribly, for reasons never explained. It was just time for another bloody killing, I guess.Someone else suggested that this was a perfect action movie because it had nothing much other than perfect action. And if you don't like action movies, then stay away from them. I suppose I don't like most action movies -- the Stallones, the Schwarzeneggers, the van Damms, although I have a few on DVDs if they have something going for them besides blood -- if the narrative is properly jelled ('The Bourne Identity') or if its so silly it's amusing ('The Terminator') -- but 'John Wick' takes itself seriously, as if it were structured in a way that distinguishes it from one of those skin flick with just enough of a thin plot to link the sexual episodes, the genre that begins with a happily married couple, then drags in a new lover for each, then the chauffeur, then the mule, and so on. Yet, the perceptive viewer is able to discern a moral message beneath the mayhem. Leave dogs alone.Why go on? John Wick, Chapter 2, is already in theaters.",3,2,8,18 February 2017
Chinatown," Marvelous
","There is a word, impossible to spell, that describes the alignment of solar bodies like the planets when they all fall into place together. A similar word would describe this film. Everything about it is right. Polanski never directed a better movie. The performers, down to the lowest atmosphere person, are superb. The editing, the score, the sound, the decor, the dialog, all are just about flawless. The photography is peerless. The white garden apartments, the terra cotta roof tiles, the palms and desert sand are all painted with a faint gold, faintly ripe with false promise, like the oranges that bounce from Gittes' desperately speeding car in the northwest Valley. Polanski deserves much of the credit. When Gittes surprises Evelyn Mulwray in her car, after he follows her to her daughter's house, her face slumps forward and beeps the horn briefly. Then, so faintly, we hear a few dogs bark in the background. Not only is the scene itself exquisitely done but it prefigures the ending, as does Gittes' remark earlier to Evelyn that she has a flaw in her iris. The movie is too good to deserve much dissecting. It stands repeated watching. If there is anything wrong with it, it is the serious and tragic ending that Polanski always insists on tacking on. Robert Towne was right and Polanski wrong in this case. Everything came together on this film. It's not only the best detective movie ever made; it's one of the best movies ever made -- period. A marvelous job by everyone concerned.I have to add (6/27/05) that the word I mentioned in the first sentence is spelled 'syzygy.' Man, did I get enlightening email on that. I might as well add two other impressive features of this movie. (1) Polanksi takes his time. Example: Gittes sneaks into Hollis Mulwray's office and begins to go through the drawers of his old-fashioned wooden desk. As he slides each drawer out, Polanksi gives us a shot of their humdrum contents (checkbooks, magnifying glass, and so forth) and we can almost smell the heat and the odor of shellac and sawdust emanating from the wooden containers. The contents reveal nothing of importance in this case. But (2) sometimes irrelevant information crops up that resonates later in the film with its own echo. The detail might be just a word ('applecore') or an ordinary object (a pair of spectacles found in a pond, immediately after Gittes imitates the Japanese gardener's remark that the water is bad for the 'glass.') Some of the references may be so consistent as to constitute a theme (water). None of this hits you over the head with its significance. It's all very neatly stitched together.",10,225,312,30 January 2002
Gravity," What Do I Do Now, Ma?
","A team of four astronauts is out in space repairing some floating piece of American technology. The team is led by George Clooney and Sandra Bullock. Oops -- force majeur. An accident elsewhere in the sky sends an invidious junk yard of space debris hurtling in their direction. They can't escape it, and two of the team are killed as their entry vehicle is destroyed.This leaves Bullock and Clooney spinning around without any way of returning to earth without getting burned up by the atmosphere. Clooney's solution: He tethers Bullock's space suit to the mobile chair he occupies and they head towards a nearby, abandoned Soyuz that has a workable re-entry system, as well as oxygen.Bullock makes it. Clooney sacrifices himself, making cheerful wisecracks as he glides off in the general direction of Betelgeuse. Bullock is some kind of engineer and lacks confidence but she becomes resourceful. In the empty but pressurized Soyuz she has the good sense to strip off that hampering space suit so we can see her floating around in a tank top and a pair of tight black shorts.Alas, the space debris comes whipping around in its orbit and bangs into the Soyuz and it tumbles around and Bullock dons a drab Russian space suit and launches a pod towards an old, decaying Chinese space station, and everything is whipped around as Newton's laws prevail, things are spun and bumped around like pin balls, there are loud thumps and WHOOMS, and I don't know what all.We've seen danger in modern space stories before. 'Marooned' and the like. They're all kind of interesting if they're at all well done. They raise provocative questions like 'What the hell are we DOING out here where there is no IHOP?' This movie gets underneath all that tension but it does so too extravagantly. The viewer is overwhelmed by the (very good) computer-generated images. And, if nothing else, the musical score will pound you into insensibility. It's full of weird sounds, eerie noises barely heard, ominous electronic chords, drums beating faster than a sprinter's heart. And it's loud.Stripped to its armature, what we have is one of those journey movies in which the lost person or persons must find their way from one watering hole to the next, hoping to hit the town or the railroad, as they plod through the desert and get bitten by rattlesnakes and stuck by vicious cholla. John Ford's 'Three Godfathers' is a good example.It's entertaining enough and sometimes thrilling. Clooney is such a likable guy, no matter his film character. And Sandra Bullock looks choice in a short haircut and short shorts. Can she really be fifty this year? She doesn't bring that much to the role. How could she? There is one touching moment when she is preparing to die and listens to an Eskimo singing a faint lullaby on the radio, but calls mostly for gasps and brief, breathless monologues. However, she speaks German flawlessly and I give her a bonus point for that. I give the movie a bonus point, too, for not being nearly as dumbed-down as most recent Hollywood productions, although this will challenge no one's sensibilities.",6,2,4,13 July 2014
Lone Survivor," Lost Patrol.
","Style and acting, fine. Format, familiar. Message -- I don't know.The true story of a group of SEALS inserted behind Taliban lines in Afghanistan. They are discovered and try to abort the mission but are ambushed by Taliban forces that outnumber them. One by one, they die until only the character played by Mark Wahlberg reaches a Pashtun village. The safety is only temporary. The Taliban soon arrive, demanding the American soldier but are forced off by the villagers. When the Taliban return in force, they are driven off by the arrival of helicopters bearing American troops, and Wahlberg is recovered.It's a brutal tale. The men suffer multiple wounds before dying and there is blood all over. When these guys jump from a cliff to escape their pursuers, it really HURTS when they hit the ground and roll the rest of the way to the bottom.None of the performers stands out much because it's an ensemble movie, and, really, not much acting is called for.At heart, it's a familiar story, like Custer's last stand or John Ford's 'Lost Patrol' or 'Bataan,' except for Wahlberg's titular survivor. It's never been done better but it IS a familiar narrative.I don't know about the message behind the movie. Of course the invasion of Afghnistan was more or less necessary and the heroism of the real SEAL team can in no way be criticized. Yet, the movie condescends to the viewer in a way that, say, 'Saving Private Ryan' or 'Blackhawk Down' did not. The movie tells us over and over, and has the characters voice it, that these men are heroes. But that's something we already know. The message of the movie is turned from 'These men are brave' into 'The audience is pretty dumb.' The direction is okay except for the now-trite slow motion deaths and falling bodies. But I don't know just how stupid the director thinks the audience is. After one cliff jump, a character finds that he's landed next to a sizable rattlesnake -- in Afghanistan. Just an added and unnecessary thrill.A few incidents ring truer than that. The mistake of calling off support from the gun ships, for instance. I can certainly believe THAT happened. The last-minute rescue by the cavalry, no -- not the way it's presented anyway.It's well worth watching despite the fact that it's regressive and resembles a flag waver from World War II.",6,3,4,9 February 2015
To Be or Not to Be," Don't Spit On My Field Gray Gabardines.
","What a fine film from Ernst Lubitsch. Jack Benny is an egomaniacal famous actor in Warsaw, and Carole Lombard his unfaithful actress wife, when the Nazis take over Poland in 1939.The plot involves secret information, impersonations, spies, clandestine trips back and forth to England, assignations with Carole Lombard, and -- oh, let me recount how the featured assignation works.Lombard is visited in her dressing room by a young and animated Robert Stack, an bomber pilot in the Polish Air Force. He's been sending her flowers for days and is overwhelmed by her presence. He boasts of his exploits and she melts while listening. When he's leaving, after she agrees to see him again, he tells her he's never met a real actress before. She replies in a throaty voice, 'I've never met a man who could drop three tons of dynamite in two minutes before.' (Lubitsch pulls this stuff off with aplomb.) The agreement is that they will meet again in her dressing room for further conversation, so to speak, during her husband's recital of Hamlet's soliloquy -- 'To be or not to be, that is the question.' Every high school kid knows it because it's perhaps the best-known line that Shakespeare ever wrote.So, we see the performance of 'Hamlet' with Robert Stack in the second row. Jack Benny enters, alone, pauses, closes the book he's holding, and looks up soulfully. It's his great moment. 'To be . . . or not to be --', he begins, and Stack stands up and shuffles his way noisily out to the aisle to be with Lombard. Benny stops talking and gapes at him.This goes on for several nights in a row. Benny has no idea why the same officer stands up and leaves at the same point in the soliloquy. It's driving him nuts. Finally, with the main plot underway, Benny is unable to perform Hamlet again until the end of the movie, on the English stage. He strolls onto the stage in the same puffed-up manner, folds his book, and begins. 'To be . . . or not to be?' And a British naval officer in the second row shuffles his way out.I don't want to get into this because I'll give away more gags, and the plot is complicated and has several surprises tucked away in it. Sig Rumann gives ample support as a comic Gestapo officer. When the movie first appeared, it was excoriated by some observers who felt that the Nazi conquest of Europe was not in the least fit as a subject for comedy. Fortunately, the Allies won the war and we can now sit back and enjoy this radiant comedy without feeling the guilt of the contemporary audience.",8,2,4,13 July 2010
Monty Python's Life of Brian," Cheerful Nihilism.
","There's a scene in this send up of Biblical movies and stories that always gets a chuckle out of me. At the end, there are a dozen or so men strung up there and left to die on crosses. Brian, the protagonist, is one of them. He's done nothing to deserve it. His friends and rescuers have failed him. But his crucified neighbor sums up the most apt attitude by cheerfully advising Brian not to be so glum about it all. He begins to sing and whistle a song, 'Always Look On The Bright Side of Life,' that contains incongruous lyrics that are too vulgar to reproduce here. Not only, 'Always look on the bright side of Death/ Just before you draw your terminal breath,' but 'Life's a piece of s***/ When you look at it....' Monty Python seem to me to have been entirely serious, amid the gaggle of gags, in skewering all of our intense dispositions to follow one or another social or religious movement. As far as I know they were only explicit about it in the penultimate scene of 'The Meaning of Life,' which wound up with an actor in drag advising us to try to be nice to one another. I think it was meant seriously.But then there is often a momentous covert message behind some of the jokes. I'll give one example.Brian, having been mistaken for a prophet in the Holy Land, runs down the streets followed by a gang of ardent worshippers and he accidentally loses his shoe and leaves it behind rather than be caught. The followers stop and gape at the shoe. One holds the shoe in the air and cries that Brian wants all of us to wear only one shoe. Another argues that it's not the shoe that's the sign, it's Brian's gourd that he left behind. An dispute ensues over whether it should be the shoe or the gourd. A joke, because the conflict lacks instrumental meaning -- except when you think of Sunni vs. Shi'ite in the Middle East, or Catholic vs. Protestant in Northern Ireland.Some of the jokes are sillier than others, recalling Mel Brooks. Pilate has speech defect. His 'r' comes out as 'w', and the crowd keeps tricking him into calling out names with lots of 'r's in them, which convulses them with laughter. 'Woger the Wobber!' he cries, and the crowd hoots and doubles over. His friend, Biggus Dickus, speaks with a lisp and is drawn into lengthy pronouncements containing 's'. Well, I DID mention Mel Brooks.It helps, though, if you're in the right mood for this nihilistic nonsense. Anything can happen. Anything goes. A man may jump from a tower and land in a space ship that happens to be speeding by. When the Roman guards find a rebel painting 'Romans Go Home' (in Latin) on a wall, they don't arrest him. They correct his grammar and make him copy it one hundred times on the wall. (The Centurion, John Cleese, had attended prep school and Cambridge and had taught Latin.) I don't know how well that will go over with kids who never heard of using correct grammar, let alone in Latin, a notoriously synthetic language in which each word contains many morphemes. I swear there must be an agglutinative language somewhere in which you can say something like, 'I'd rather watch television tonight than hang out at the Sonicburger' -- and it all comes out as one word.Anyway, if you're in a mood to have your head taken and shaken back and forth a little, 'The Life of Brian' might get the job done.",7,2,6,17 December 2011
Erin Brockovich," Slick heart warmer.
","These kinds of films are beginning to form a genre unto themselves. 'Marie,' 'Silkwood,' 'Afterburn,' 'Guerin,' 'Norma Rae', and 'Brokovich.' Elements, too, in other successful heart warmers like 'Mask' and 'Class Action'.The basic idea is to pit a lower-class David against a multi billion-dollar Goliath and have the underdog win. (Maybe I should have included 'Rocky' in that list.) Well, Erin Brokovich is the real thing, a trailer-park floozy with messy hair, a quick vulgar mouth, and boobs that look like two helium balloons about to pop up out of her push-up bra. No wonder her female coworkers hate her. Not just her looks though. She's a human dynamo at work. She collects something like 640 signed affidavits over a week and the stuffy partners at her law firm gawk and ask how she did it. 'I went out and distributed sexual favors,' she says. 'Six hundred and forty BJs in five days. I'm tired.' (The camera lingers on her triumphant expression so we can share her joy in humiliating her superiors.) It's very slickly done. Her life is filled with travails. I mean, out of work, three fatherless children, rear ended by some rich dope in a Mercedes. Fortunately there's a guy.Therein is an illustration of a slight problem. These folks look real enough on the surface but they're actually ringers. Erin, despite her cutting sarcasm, doesn't really speak much like a redneck and neither do the other people of her class. Nobody smokes. (Might drive away the intended audience.) The guy she falls in with is introduced as some kind of biker/doper wearing ragged jeans, a faded bandanna wrapped around his head, a beard, and a pony tale -- revving up his chopper after he moves in next door. But it's all a front. The bandanna is soon dropped and we get to know him for the quiet, quietly reassuring, supportive, child-loving Mensch that he truly is. When the trappings of bikerhood are gone -- and we never see the bike again -- he sits there in silence while Erin pours out her woes and, what with his neat beard, his reading glasses and his serenity and his slight, tolerant smile, he is more a Jewish psychotherapist than a biker.Of course he has to pack up and leave her at some point otherwise the movie would be absent one clichÃ©. They're both sad about the split, and it doesn't last that long, but, as he explains it, he never sees her anymore because she's always working late. He does everything but say, 'You're already married -- to your job.' There's never a moment's doubt about who is good and who is bad in a movie like this. Erin is authentic and good, like the earth before it was poisoned by PG&E. The fraudulent biker is also good. We know it right away, although she doesn't. Erin's boss, Finney, is good too, although a little gruff at times, kind of like Lou Grant. The victims of the lethal chromium isotope are all good too. None of them is in it for the money. The new partners that Finney acquires to help him cover his expenses are on the right side but they're pretentious. They dress in expensive tailored clothing and are aghast when Erin swears. The poor woman who represents the new partners looks as if she took baths in a mild solution of hydrochloric acid. There is no life either in her or on her. Her hair is pulled back severely, she wears a suit and tie, and her makeup gives her a cadaverous glow.It's not a thoughtful film by any measure, but it does get the job done. Goliath is vanquished by David and we applaud as the end credits roll. The performances are adequate -- no better than that, but no worse either. Sometimes the film borrows entire modules from other successful movies. The resentment of the antagonistic informant who answers the door when the investigator knocks. ('Verdict,' 'All the President's Men'.) The heroine caught up in the cause that threatens her love life. ('Silkwood,' 'Norma Rae.') The script makes fun of a jealous fat woman. ('Kiss my ***, Krispy Kreme.') It's that kind of movie.",6,2,5,6 October 2006
Se7en," Literate, Engaging Genre Piece
","Nicely plotted and well-written script, suitably ominous score, good performances all around.I think the seven deadly sins were codified in the sixth century by Pope Gregory I. Keven Spacey, as the serial killer (there seems to be no end of them), takes them seriously enough to track down good examples of each and execute them according to their cardinal traits. For instance, he ties an obese man into a chair and force feeds him until he is the size of the puking man in 'Monty Python's Meaning of Life,' and then kicks him until he explodes. The older I get and the more the flesh sags, the less amusing I find this concept.The murders, by the way, are pretty disgusting, what with the darkness lighted by tiny candles, the flies buzzing around, the mutilated and decomposing corpses, the severed body parts, and all that.Particularly horrifying are the last two of the seven killings. One involves an excess of envy and the other of anger. I don't want to give much more away, but they involve Spacey himself and one of the two detectives (Freeman and Pitt). The incident is a most unexpected twist, and a plausible one. That's what I meant in describing this as well written. As an unintended bonus there is an exchange between the detectives, in 1995. Freeman has just bribed an FBI man for a list of library records. Certain books are flagged and when someone checks them out, the users records are fed into the Bureau's data base. Pitt: 'Wait a minute now. How is this legal?' Freeman: 'Legal, illegal, these terms don't apply here.'Freeman and Pitt are the usual mismatched cops at the beginning, but this is not a mismatched buddy movie by any means. Half-way through and their few differences are resolved in a reasonable manner.Pitt doesn't do a bad job, and Morgan Freeman is outstanding as usual. What a fine actor he is. Ordinarily he's rock solid but then watch him as a murderous pimp in 'Street Smart' to get an idea of his range. And the movie simply would not be all that it is without Gwyneth Paltrow. She is a gangly blond with features so delicate that a viewer gets the impression that the slightest kiss on her cheek might leave a memorial bruise. That's important, for reasons I won't go into. The scene in the cafe in which she helplessly asks a helpless Freeman for advice about her secret pregnancy could have been either cloying or unnecessary if it had been written clumsily, but it was not. We can feel the actors meshing like gear wheels during the conversation.If I had a problem it was with the lights. I wish someone had bothered to turn them on. Okay, a murder scene in a shabby apartment could be dark. But why is the PRECINCT STATION as gloomy as a Bohemian bar? I realize this underlighting is fashionable -- damn 'The X Files' -- but it's getting tiresome to see people running around during action scenes carrying flashlights. While I'm complaining I might as well mention that the score, though brooding, is loud, obtrusive, and generic. Under the opening credits it passes through the obtrusive barrier into irritating, as are the credits themselves, which are shaky and resemble the deliberate but sloppy scrawl of a kindergardener. Every scene is underlined by edgy music except one in which Freeman pokes around in the library, when the composer uses the rapturous Air on a G String, the most accessible piece Bach ever wrote. The very well done library scene reminded me of college one hundred years ago when students had ideals. During exam week the student radio station would play nothing but suitable classical music. You could walk across the quad and hear Bach coming from two dozen open windows, a 24.0 sound system.That's a minor carp though. The is a genuinely good example of the genre. Another thriller about a serial murderer, but a good example still.",7,2,4,22 January 2006
The Big Lebowski," Relaxed spoof with charm.
","Something about an aging hippie called 'The Dude' who is hired to find a woman who's kidnapping was faked and who was supposed to be ransomed with fake money, but none of that has anything to do with the film, which makes fun of just about everything, fake or genuine.Among the targets of the Coen brothers' jibes, I was able to identify political correctness, movies about private investigators, Busby Berkley, Njinsky, the psychedelic subculture, pornography, celebrity, the ritual solemnity of funerals, sage old Westerners (cf., Curly in 'City Slickers'), the military mentality, the violent gangs of terrorists with German accents that insist on turning up in action movies, hippies, and Malibu.The acting is just good enough, with Jeff Bridges and John Goodman fitting nicely into their roles. Here's an example of some wit from the dialog. Bridges is a private investigator. He finds his car being broken into by a stranger, pulls the man out, and threatens him. Wait! the other guy shouts. He's a private investigator too, just like Bridges, 'a brother Shamus.' 'Brother Seamus? Like an Irish Monk?'There's a lot of malice in this film but it's undercut by a gentle, easy-going presentation that embodies a certain off-kilter charm and is more likely to lead to smiles than either outright laughter or self-righteous resentment. I forgive it its occasional misdirection.It's not a masterpiece but it's certainly an original piece of work, and it probably ought to be seen for that reason alone, if not for any other. The MBA committees that are currently grinding out the Supersonicburgers in Hollywood should be the first in line. They need the lesson.",6,6,14,23 September 2007
Fury," Uncertain Glory.
","I expected more from the movie but more turned out to be less.It's really a 'last stand' story except that in the Spring of 1945 American tankers weren't making much of a last stand. That's the way the movie presents it. But the real 7th Cavalry was the Wehrmacht, who were just about out of everything except boys and old men, fanatic SS troops, and great big-assed Tiger tanks that our M-4 Shermans couldn't hope to cope with, despite the newer model having been up-gunned and despite there being far more Shermans than Tigers. We also had air superiority and a vast advantage in artillery, so we were plowing our way through a nearly spent Germany. Yet that doesn't stop the movie from turning It's a grim story, all rain, muck, and mud, and a Sherman tank with 'FURY' painted on the barrel. That barrel was part of a high-velocity 76 mm. cannon, which was an improvement over the earlier variant's 75 mm. But the movie doesn't explain any of that because that's not where it wants to go.And that raises the question of where the movie DOES want to go. My answer is firm. I don't know.It's another CGI extravaganza but not that much of an improvement over the 'Great Tank Battles' that can be seen on YouTube. Brad Pitt is the tank commander and he's a pretty lousy guy who commits war crimes and tells the newly arrived audience proxy member to go screw a German girl they've discovered in an abandoned house. 'If you don't take her in the bedroom, I will.' Improbably -- IMPOSSIBLY -- she seems to fall in love with him after one roll in the hay, and after these five greasy aliens have occupied her shabby flat and eaten her food.Pitt's main characteristics, aside from his authoritarianism and sadism, is his desire to kill Germans. In the end it leads to the death of all the crew members but one.The supporting crew members are grimy stereotypes: the Bible-thumping gunner, the Latino driver, and the drawling Southern loader. The junior soldier is a greenhorn clerk redirected into tank service as the assistant gunner. He gets a swift, wide-eyed education in warfare while desperately trying to survive and integrate with his unwelcoming, veteran crew mates.One of the crew -- I forget which -- is given an especially repulsive appearance and demeanor. He slobbers freely. He has a distinctive and very ugly haircut. I had a feeling that the director and the make up folks would love to have shaved his head bald and given him a Goth tattoo but even THEY realized that it might give the game away.Well -- a virtue of the movie. You get a better feel for the crowded, painted, steel interior of the tank that I've seen in any other movie.Otherwise, if you need a mindless adrenalin fix, this is probably the answer.",5,3,9,6 August 2015
Fight Club," Rebels without a cause.
","It's very impressive visually, nicely directed, well acted, scripted in a literate way, and immeasurably depressing.I suppose the plot has been covered in detail elsewhere so I'll keep it brief. The narrator (Edward Norton)is a bored, anomic insomniac who doesn't know why he's alive. He runs into a creepy and insulting babe (Helena Bonham Carter) who seems to care about nothing. Then he meets a brutally honest Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt) who seems to see through everything and everyone, who actively hates and engages in combat against modern ennui and phoniness, and things start to pop. Pitt and the narrator found Fight Club in which men who would otherwise be leading lives of quiet desperation get to pound the crap out of one another. Fight Club franchises spring up everywhere as men search for their lost cojones. Pitt becomes a cult leader and wages war against corporate art with homemade explosives. The upshot of all this, I won't reveal.I didn't like it at all. At first I thought it was going to turn into one of those Gallic philosophical conundrums with a lot of pointless non sequiturs in the foreground. (Narrator: Is Tyler Durden in my dream? Or am I in his?') Then it appeared to morph into an excuse for more bloodshed and violence. And then it got really twisted. I never realized a guy could shoot off a large-caliber pistol in his mouth and carry on a normal conversation five minutes later.It will, I suppose, be claimed that this is an original -- in contrast to the formulaic rubbish ground out by Hollywood these days. True enough, but it's not all THAT original. Proving your masculinity by enduring punishment? Is there a Rambo movie in which Stallone doesn't bleed, or get himself dipped in pig excrement, or electrocuted half to death, without flinching? In the stockade, in James Jones' 'From Here to Eternity,' the guards treat the inmates with unspeakable brutality. So what do the prisoners do to prove their transcendance of authority? They beat hell out of each other, in games, in ways that the guards wouldn't have the imagination to dream up. Not to mention a hundred movies about The Big House and POWs and slaves biting their tongues during whippings.The punishment within the group is only part of the story, of course. It leads to a consideration of secret cults and their desire to rid the world of credit cards. We've had that before too, with Charlie Manson and the Reverend Jim Jones. And if Tyler Durden is going to insult the narrator by calling him 'Ikea Boy', and if the group is going to assault society by demolishing icons like Starbucks, don't they have some kind of obligation to provide more constructive icons? Shouldn't they have some sense of beauty, truth, and logic that takes them beyond moral nihilism? Or is the movie actually saying that Western civilization SHOULD be destroyed? The film is ugly to watch, partly because the message itself is so banal, and partly because the imagery is so repulsive. The back of somebody's head is blown off. Human fat is boiled down to make soap. Fight Club members lives in an abandoned house near a toxic waste dump amid unutterable squalor. They don't seem to change clothes. (The narrator shows up for work at his office with his own blood on his shirt.) They don't bathe. Brad Pitt shuffles around in a filthy bathrobe wearing a pair of lady's slippers with clotted fur around the tops, as Doris Day might appear during a trip on battery acid. It isn't that I find such voluntarism necessarily bad. I'm sitting here writing this, wearing only a sarong and a pair of eyeglasses in the middle of the desert. But doesn't bodily filth reach a point at which it becomes intolerable to the self, never mind the person you're trying to sell your homemade soap to? Mostly, though, what a beastly message. If you want to swagger around, a member of a cult, dealing out summary punishment to those whose values aren't your own, why not join Blackwater or some other mercenary group and at least get paid more than one thousand dollars a day. Or if you really want to get in your face with respect to bourgeois verities, give away everything you have and serve soup to the homeless at St. Anthony's Dining Room. Or vote Libertarian? Or become a Theravada Buddhist monk, earning merit and living on alms? I guess, though, that nothing like that is going to get your testosterone pumping and that's what concerns this movie. Know when blood testosterone levels peak in men? During late adolescence, when our fantasies are even more limited than our brain power.",5,4,14,1 October 2007
As Good as It Gets," Dog
","This is a movie for children with a few kibbles thrown in for adults. Jack Nicholson is reliable, as usual, and Helen Hunt is surprisingly appealing, but their performances are torpedoed by a plot that is lifted from Walt Disney's most saccharine nightmare. Where to begin? We start with a guy suffering from OCD, played for laughs, and played very well too. Nicholson is a misogynistic, anti-Semitic homophobe, and an amusing one. He has nowhere to go but up. And the movie is basically the story of his rise up the ladder to what the rest of us consider 'normality.' First the dog. Any movie with a dog, especially a cute, curly little thing, immediately prompts any reasonable person to envy the misanthrope who lives alone and likes it. This beast is unbearable, with disproportionately large black eyes straight out of a Walter Keane painting, who actually manages to produce tears when he seems about to leave Nicholson for another keeper. Even Disney wouldn't have dared that. Next the gay artist and his friends from across the hall, the gay guy who is bashed and sent to the hospital, whom Nicholson eventually comes to accept. Half-way up the ladder now, folks. Finally, the woman, the waitress he's been hassling at the restaurant, the woman with the seriously ill child at home. Nicholson reaches the top of the ladder when he tells her, 'You make me want to be a better man.' Finally the nightmare is over. It did well critically too, as well as with the public. And when Nicholson is on screen, you don't want to take your eyes off him. But the movie falls into a certain, increasingly commonly encountered class: the garish, in-your-face, about-something-important class that really doesn't have much to say. Brooks is only one of several directors who really aren't trying to produce anything else. Ron Howard, Penny Marshall, and Rob Reiner are others. They're more like made-for-TV think pieces than features. (Brooks was a writer and director for 'The Mary Tyler Moore Show.') The films are colorful, sprinkled with obscenities and innuendos, filled with choker close ups as if the director had forgotten for the moment that he was shooting for the big screen rather than the small, spiced up with set-pieces and windy speeches that spell out whatever kibble of information the film carries. There is never a moment's doubt about who and what is good or bad. The endings are happy. Everyone wants a happy ending and they get nothing if not wish-fulfillment in these movies. But -- despite itself -- this movie and the others like it raise a quite serious question: Exactly how dumbed-down are American movies going to get?",5,1,7,11 February 2002
Citizen Kane," Look On My Works, Ye Mighty, And Despair.
","I don't know exactly what's left to say about 'Citizen Kane', about it's technical dazzle or the maturity of its plot, but it's interesting to note that its prominence gained height only gradually. At first, if not disregarded, it was mostly unnoticed, probably because William Randolph Hearst and his newspaper chain (pre-TV and pre-blog) avoided any mention of it. Only in the last 20 years or so has it been recognized for the masterpiece that it is.Of course everyone's heard of it by now, and though most of us admire it, some despise it. I suspect that if some of us dislike it, it's not because of the film itself, but because the majority adore it. This is known as 'contrarianism' and I blame the Frogs for it.The French -- I can carry on with these Olympian generalizations, can't it? I mean, I'm protected by the First Amendment, right? The French have this tendency to turn common values upside down. That's what gave the world Jerry Lewis.Not that I intend to put France and its couture down entirely. The single best sandwich I ever ate was in the Gare du Nord. But, really, take the anthropologist Claude Levi-Strauss as an example. Greek mythology? Pfui. Let's look more closely at Tlingit myths. The Tlingit are not proto-scientists or philosophers. They're a bunch of clam diggers in the Northwest. I should know, having lived with them.Where was I? Oh, yes. That sandwich. Wow.Getting back to 'Citizen Kane,' I watch it now and again -- not too often because I have it memorized. But here's an example of why I think it's a masterpiece. Okay. Charles Foster Kane has forced his wife, who has a mediocre voice, to push herself into becoming an opera star with the help of his vast financial resources. She fails and tries to poison herself.Here's how that scene plays out on screen. The camera is shooting poor half-dead Dorothy Comingore in fuzzy close up, looking anything but glamorous, breathing heavily, covered with sweat, unconscious, her face away from the door on which Kane and his minions are banging. Behind her figure is a table on which we see the suicide apparatus -- bottles and glasses. It's a rear projection, meaning that Comingore was being filmed while a screen behind her (previously shot) is being shown behind her. And -- within THAT back projection -- there is a third projection screen of the door, which finally swings open and admits Kane. Back projections were in common use in 1941 -- but a projection within a projection? (Welles used the same technique later, in 'Lady From Shanghai.') Okay. As someone said, Welles was a kid with a new toy -- the camera. But he turned it into a model that did barrel rolls and crazy eights. Few have done it better since then -- and Welles' technique was tacked onto an adult story with no bad guys and no good guys, yet gripping. A young man loses his illusions as he ages. (Don't we all?) Welles' output went downhill from there, his apologists notwithstanding, not because of a monstrous ego. That's too easy. He couldn't bring himself to finish the editing because it was never again to meet his demanding expectations.Don't let revisionists beguile you. It's one of the best movies ever made, and you can measure its quality along any number of dimensions, from Greg Toland's revolutionary photograph to Benny Hermann's subtle but apt score.It's pretty good.",10,1,4,4 November 2008
Monster," Lying Down With Dogs.
","An intense, depressing movie. It sticks pretty close to the facts but focuses chiefly on the relationship between Charlize Theron as Lee and Christina Ricci as Selby. The police are hardly there at all. In fact, neither is anyone else except for Bruce Dern who makes one or two short but welcome appearances.It could easily have been a by-the-numbers TV movie. (Come to think of it, it has, hasn't it? With Jean Smart?) But the production values are good, and the time and money has been spent on this film that we usually associate with feature films.The cinematography is outstanding. The shots of Lee near the end of her rope, hitching on a foggy blue nightime Florida highway look like a desktop theme from some arty horror/occult site. The script doesn't have many tag lines. No 'Rosebuds' or 'I coulda been a contendah.' Nor is it folksy or catching in some other way. The dialogue follows the story in being pretty straightforward and without much in the way of noticeable touches. The director should be commended on her handling of two things. One is the explanation for Lee's crimes. None is given. There is a short scene in which Lee tells one of her johns about her miserable childhood, but the abuse excuse is vitiated by Selby's mother, an orthodox and unimaginative woman, who says simply that lots of people have hard childhoods without growing up like Lee. And the men are not all turned into sadistic hogs, which must have been a temptation for the writers. The second virtue in the direction is its management of the murders. Instead of exploding heads, there are a few squibs, and usually not even that, before the victim yields to the fathomless, cool, enwinding arms of death. The themes explored here are not so much violence as love and desperation.Ricci looks the part, with her broad forehead and tiny lips, but comes across more as a Valley Girl than the kind of outcast who would pick up and move off with someone like Lee.Which brings us to Theron's performance as Lee. It's startling, of course, to see a glamor-puss like Theron so thoroughly deglamorized. It's the kind of performance that wins Academy Awards -- lesbians, the height-challenged, autistics, all have won awards in recent years. Theron deserves recognition for her effort too, but not just because of the makeup and wardrobe. They're all splendid. Makeup has shaved her brows to a Mona Lisa extent and turned her face just blotchy enough and given her a raggedy set of teeth.But that's not all that has made her performance as the central character so memorable. (She's in almost every frame.) And it isn't the thirty or so pounds that she put on for the role either. What's so homeric about that? I can put on thirty pounds without blinking an eye, and enjoy doing it. Heck, I can put on forty or fifty if she wants to get into a peeing contest. No -- it's Theron herself who MAKES the character. She's great, particularly in her physical manifestation of Lee -- her body language, for instance. Instead of coasting through the role, she animates it. The way she struts around with her shoulders thrown back and her face down, emphasizing her several chins and the girth of her neck. Maybe it takes a profession ballerina to figure out these little techniques. Her voice isn't as coarse as that of a hooker who constantly puffs on cigarettes, but Theron does what she can with her own. She overcomes her native South African speech with no trouble and introduces us to a breathless bravado that she's never used on screen before -- not that I know of.Her movements, her speech, her dreams, are filled with a desperate illusion that doesn't exactly make us feel sorry for her but does make us worry for her -- that she might, for instance, start screaming at any minute and never stop. A nerve-racking picture of a ruined soul.Is it worth seeing? Absolutely. You won't learn too much about how Aileen Wournos turned into the person she did. Even the narrative itself is a little confusing at time, so that you can't be sure where Lee and Selby are at given moments. But it's Hollywood professionalism at one of its rare high points. It's made by a mature team for an audience of adults. Refreshing.",8,113,130,18 December 2004
The Birth of a Nation," The Stern Lessons of Honor.
","Leaving the message aside for the moment, I don't think that anyone could deny that for 1915 this was a monumental achievement. Griffith was a genuine innovator, and one of the first. As a film maker he deserves at least the disinterest that Leni Riefenstahl gets.He's often said to have 'invented the grammar of film,' whatever that means. (For twenty years I've had trouble thinking of anything, except language, as a language.) He didn't invent cross-cutting, a device that shows us a critical scene, cuts to the onrushing rescuers, then back and forth to juice up the tension. But he did invent what came to be called 'invisible editing.' Ante-Griffith, if there was a scene in which someone wiped his forehead of sweat, it was done in a single shot. Post-Griffith, we might see the figure in a far shot begin to lift his handkerchief, then a cut to a medium close up in which the figure completes the action, beginning precisely where it was cut off in the previous shot.That doesn't sound like much but it did alter the way movies were made, and Griffith does it here. He also tells a LONG and complicated story forthrightly and with a minimum use of title cards, a big relief because, man, are the titles stilted, sentimental, florid, embarrassing. But making such a lengthy and still coherent movie was an achievement in itself. It was a big, expensive movie with lots of characters and hundreds of extras, about an epic event in history, and Griffith pulls it off. Credit where credit is due.It's impossible to comment on the performances because they are all over wrought, as was the convention at the time. I suppose the casting is adequate, if not very subtle. Lillian Gish is fetchingly virginal with her tiny lips, but I preferred Miriam Cooper as one of the Southern Cameron daughters. She has a prominent nose, black hair, and dark soulful eyes, and she looks as if she's been around a little.The DVD I have is splotched and marred and the only virtue of the sound track is that you get to hear The New World Symphony from beginning to end and, here and there, excerpts from other light classics.At this point it becomes impossible to avoid talking about the plot. Here's the story. Happy Southern Cameron family, riding horses and such, chuckling along with the happy darkies picking the cotton. Sour-looking Senator Stoneman in Pennsylvania, abolitionist, who is nevertheless close friends with the Cameron family. Stoneman boy loves Cameron girl.Then comes the war. (Kids: That's the American Civil War, 1861 to 1865. The North won.) A title card informs us that Lincoln has just asserted the rights of the federal government over those of the sovereign states, the first time since Cornwallis surrendered at Yorktown. (Kids: That's a reference to the Revolutionary War. PS: We won.) If your ears haven't pricked up before, now's the time for them to do it. Griffith either forgot about, or didn't know, about the Articles of Confederation being replaced by the Constitution.In any case this is not the place to refight the Civil War or to argue over the Reconstruction Era that followed the Federal victory. Part I takes the viewer up through the Civil War and is generally accurate. Part II goes completely ape. 'I will build a Black Empire and you will be my white queen.' 'The streets are filled with crazed Negroes.' A little white Southern girl jumps to her death to avoid being raped by some villainous black guy. The Ku Klux Klan comes riding to the rescue of another -- well, two others, actually. An African-American judge and jury convict a white gentleman of something he wasn't supposed to do -- aiding and abetting the Klan. In 1931, the white folks made up for it. An all-white judge and jury convicted nine young black men of something they didn't do at all -- raping two white women -- in Scottsboro, Alabama. Griffith had another thing right. Reconstruction under President Johnson and others is generally considered a calamity visited upon the South. In the absence of a formal system of justice, we often wind up with an informal one. From 1889 through 1918 mobs lynched 129 persons in the Midwest, 9 in New England, and 2,915 in the South and Border South. The nation reached a total of 3,587 by 1930.D. W. Griffith is said to have been surprised at the outrage caused by his film, and I believe it. Like President Woodrow Wilson, who said of the movie, 'it's all true,' Griffith was a Southerner at a time when the South was so isolated that it was almost a country unto itself. Whatever the opposite of 'cosmopolitanism' is, Griffith was it. I believe it, too, when he claimed he meant no harm. He was like the Buddha leaving his father's garden at sixteen and discovering for the first time that there was more than one point of view.",5,2,4,17 September 2010
Inglourious Basterds," Schlock and Awe.
","It's one of those movies that's difficult to evaluate because it's as inconsistent as it is. The plot is ludicrous yet there are very suspenseful moments embedded in it. Nobody could have made this except Quentin Tarantino -- it's that original -- and yet it rips off bits of business and entire subplots from a dozen or more other sources.Any enthusiasm I felt for it is limited because some scenes -- the entirety of 'Chapter One' -- approach a kind of pornography of torture that's in danger of becoming a genre unto itself, and Tarantino, the writer and director, seems to get too much of a kick out what is some pretty ugly stuff.Brad Pitt is an American officer with an atrocious mountain accent who recruits a half dozen men to be inserted into France with the object of killing Nazis. The men are Jewish. The reasoning goes: the Nazis kill Jews, therefore we will kill Nazis. The collateral killing of any innocents is beside the point. The innocent must be punished along with the guilty. See 'The Dirty Dozen' is you want a classier presentation of this moral nihilism.Not only do Pitt and his men kill the Nazis they capture. They scalp them too, and Tarantino treats the audience several times to explicit scenes of the men slicing the scalps of hair from the skulls of the dead.One captured officer is told to indicate where his unit is and how well armed and refuses, saying he will not yield information that will endanger the lives of German soldiers. There's a scene in 'Reservoir Dogs,' in which Michael Madsen is left alone with an innocent policeman and caresses his razor as he describes the pleasure he's going to get from torturing the prisoner. In 'Reservoir Dogs,' Madsen is the sadistic madman and the cop is the terrified captive who winds up being mutilated. In 'Inglorious Bastards,' the German officer who refuses to give up the information is told he will have his brains beaten out by a Jew wielding a baseball bat -- 'The Bear Jew.' The scene is long and drawn out. The camera cuts between the blackness of the cave from with The Bear Jew will emerge -- we hear the bat banging against the wall and coming close -- and close ups of the horrified face of the officer awaiting his own death. The horror is justified. The point is that the sadistic lunatic of 'Reservoir Dogs' has become the hero now.Well -- what's the point of this scene? Just killing the recalcitrant officer is a violation of the Geneva Conventions. But why draw the scene out with such relish? What does Tarantino expect from the viewer? Chills, thrills -- exaltation -- during the anticipation of the grisly murder? LAUGHTER? That's the kind of crap I'd expect in a cheap slasher movie before the pretty girl in the underwear gets her throat cut and blood splashes all over the walls.'Pulp Fiction' was a true original, even if it was a couple of sub-plots slapped together. 'Reservoir Dogs' had some fine acting, though it ended pointlessly. Both were essentially well-done in their own shocking ways.But I can't forgive Tarantino for this one. I don't mind the in-jokes. (The name of Pitt's officer is 'Aldo Raine.') There is even some intentional comedy that works. Pitt is trying to pass himself off as a native Italian, and you ought to hear him mangle the word 'arrivederci.' But not even the scenes that embody suspense, the genuinely well-staged episode in the basement night club, can lift this effort out of the teen-aged trash can.Good performances for the most part, especially from Melanie Laurent who is unmistakably French, Christoph Waltz as the chief Nazi villain, and Daniel Bruhl as the fresh-faced young German hero who is given some inexplicable and uncharacteristically villainous lines just before he's done in.The climax is a fantasy, which is okay, but there are signs of outright carelessness in the direction. (I don't want to call it stupidity.) The audience of high-ranking Nazis is sitting there watching a movie about a heroic sniper and everyone -- der Fuhrer included -- is laughing out loud as hundreds of American soldiers are shot and killed in a strictly Hollywood manner, twirling around, stunt men tumbling down stairs, anachronistic squibs exploding. Does anyone actually believe that an audience of sophisticates would laugh during a movie like this? Or -- let me put it differently. We made the same kind of movie, 'To Hell And Back,' in which Audie Murphy played his historically heroic self and slaughtered hundreds of Germans. Did anyone laugh? Tarantino unquestionably has a lot of movie-making skill. Maybe it's time for him to reconsider the parameters of his morality.",3,36,63,14 August 2010
Amistad," Commercial, slow, professional.
","The first third of the movie is pretty exciting, loaded with dramatic special effects -- a storm at sea, stroboscopic lightning, butcher with a cutlass. The second act is interesting too and competently done. The 40-some captured Mende are introduced to New England culture, such as it was in 1839, and Spielberg does a nice job with language problems, misunderstandings, and the clash between the outraged and murderous big black guys on the one hand, and the psalm-singing shrunken white moralists on the other. The third act kind of loses steam and ultimately peters out in a series of trials -- three actually -- in which the blacks ultimately gain the freedom they'd lost in Sierra Leone.I'll give one example each of the movie's strong points and weaknesses.Djimon Hounsou is terrific as the lead would-be slave. He's an impressive physical presence, tall, muscular, brooding. When he's angry he booms and shouts and his eyes bulge slightly. He is every intimidated white person's nightmare come true. But that's his character. As an actor he's far more sly, and this is no one-note performance. He rarely smiles but when he is obviously pleased he looks out of the corners of his eyes, shyly, almost furtively, and it's touching. His Mende-ness, his 'other'-ness, is suggested just enough. He stands a little too close to the people he's dealing with, the way Mediterranean people do. And if it makes US a little uncomfortable just watching it, we can only imagine how the descendants of the Mayflower felt about this whole business. Close enough to smell each other! The Africans are treated as ordinary folks, which is pretty much what they are, allowing for cultural differences, and we get to see enough of the inhuman way they were treated by slavers to know the suffering they've been through. And that's about where the movie drops the ball. Spielberg and his writers don't really trust the audience enough to allow them understanding to this extent. The Africans, if not exactly ennobled by their horrors, are given dramatic scenes which are too many in quantity and too bald in their intent.Hounsou -- in the middle of a trial in which his fate is being decided, carried on in a language he does not understand -- has to stand up in the docks raise his manacled fists and repeatedly shout, 'Give us FREE. Give us FREE!' And in the denouement, when they are freed for the last time to return to Africa, Hounsou goes from white savior to white savior, eyes brimming with tears, while soupy music swells in the background, and clasps hands with each of them -- at length. (That last handclasp almost turns shockingly into a high-five.) It's not only unnecessary, it goes on way too long.Well, I'll throw in another observation. Anthony Hopkins is John Quincy Adama, former President, by this time in his life course a curmudgeonly old geezer with a lot still on the ball. He only has two scenes -- an early introduction in which we see him perfunctorily giving orders to people trying to help him walk. ('Gimme a hand.' 'Leggo my arm.') And a later summary given to the court that once and for all ends the legal baloney. The speech isn't really well written. It doesn't say much, and what it says is not particularly gripping. But Hopkins' performance could not be improved upon. He's got the role down pat, even to the suggestion of a Boston accent. Not MUCH of a Boston accent, but no more than is necessary because, after all, in 1839 Bostonians may have sounded as much like their Brit ancestors as like Barney Frank.The photography is great. The location shooting is good -- those dreary New England winters. Well worth seeing, despite the overdone moralizing.",6,0,3,4 January 2006
Shakespeare in Love," Exeunt Educated
","You can't help wondering how Shakespeare managed it.  In 26 years he produced 37 plays, three epic poems, and all those sonnets, on top of which he was an actor and prosperous businessman.  I would be hard put to type everything he wrote in those years using a quill pen and pot of ink.  The haste sometimes shows.  His plots are often weak and derivative and suffer excessively from what Ebert calls the idiot plot syndrome, in which characters do the stupidest things just to keep the story hopping.  When King Lear asks his daughters how much they love him, Cordelia's one-sentence answer is misunderstood and sets the whole tragedy in motion, though the problem could be solved with a few additional words.  Whole chunks of dialogue in Julius Caeser are shamelessly ripped off from Plutarch.  But the poetry is a different matter, resonant, finely constructed, and sometimes ethereal.  Well, this movie is, in short, the story of how WS came to write Romeo and Juliet, chiefly it seems by integrating bits of his personal life into the mosaic of the play.  He overhears someone on the street yelling, 'A plague on both your houses,' and so on.  And the movie is filled with amusing anachronistic expressions.  Actors say 'break a leg' to one another, and they say things like 'boobies' and 'dip your wick' and 'we'll be put in the clink.'  It's not jarring because none of this fairy tale is supposed to be realistic.  Basically there are two ways a movie about a period classic can go.  (1) There is the elegant way.  Everyone wears immaculate clothes and speaks a sort of perfumed English; vide Olivier.  (2)  There is the dirty way, the route this movie takes, in which characters may be sweaty and vulgar, get into slapstick brawls in the mud, use barely interpretable dialects, and bump into things.  The actors here do a nice job along their naturalistic way.  The dialogue is written in such a way as to suggest the author just finished reading the bard's collected works in one sitting.  WS is clean cut and handsome, though he has inky fingernails.  Paltrow, as Viola, uses an irreproachable English accent and impresses with her lanky body and her sharply boned, slightly asymmetrical face, although she too must brush her teeth and spit.  One also looks forward to the appearance of even the most minor supporting players.  And Judy Dench as QE I is a standout, coiffed like an escapee from Coppola's Dracula.If there is a problem it's that it helps to understand the film if you are a fan of Shakespeare.  I don't mean that you necessarily like the film more, just that you understand it better.  Then you know why Marlowe is such a pain as far as WS is concerned, and why Burbage makes such a stir when he enters the theater for the first time, and why the rival theatrical troupes enact so realistically the Donnybrook between the Capulet and the Montague boys.  I could tell there were a lot of allusions that were getting past me. No matter.  There is verisimilitude enough that you finish viewing the film a more educated person than before.What a place Elizabethan London must have been if you could somehow set aside the plague, the smallpox, the outhouses, the poverty and starvation and odor and other such quibbles.  Along these streets, at the same time, strode people like Queen Elizabeth, Condell, Burbage, Thomas Kyd, Marlowe, Sir Francis Drake, Frobisher -- every English-speaking person who was anybody at the time, it seems.  This film, a mixture of fact and plausible fantasy, is pretty enjoyable.",Null,1,2,28 January 2002
Two for the Money," Don't Bet On It.
","There are myriad movies about a young man who has an amateur's gift for something. Then he enters the big leagues, the enterprise becomes demystified, he faces inner or outer demons, overcomes them, achieves momentous success, and returns to his roots, a man in full.That's pretty much the tale of McConaughey, an amiable naif giving comments and advice on a backwoods radio program who's talent is for figuring out who's going to win football games.He gets a call from Al Pacino, who runs -- well, I don't know what the enterprise can be called. It's a large room full of experts on football who sell betting odds over the phone, rather like stockbrokers, only this is serious money. Pacino is expansive and seductive, almost a reprise of his role in 'The Devil's Advocate.' He takes over McConaughey's life, buys him expensive suits, advertises him, and puts him on a TV show. Pacino's wife, Rene Russo, takes a shine to McConaughey too, but nothing untoward happens. McConaughey's a likable guy -- until he gets cocky, superior, and begins to take time off to play golf. A series of failures bring down both him and Pacino, until the climactic Big Win.The characters are superbly written by Dan Gilroy, and the dialog sounds like the Fourth of July parade in Disneyland. The violent language sparkles with a hilarious profanity. Pacino's metaphors rise to the heights of poetry. I can't reproduce any here.The score is unobtrusive, the location shooting evocative without showing off, and Conrad Hall's seasoned photography catches it all nicely on celluloid.All the performances, major and minor, are fine but there are times when it's hard to discern a character's motivation. Pacino and McConaughey have a complex relationship, switching back and forth between deep affection and creeping suspicion. The switches sometimes come too quickly and for reasons that remain murky. I don't know why Pacino embraces McConaughey instead of just kicking his ass out, when McConaughey comes up with a string of losers, and I don't know the significance of making big bets on the flip of a coin (twice). Last scene: a refurbished and renewed McConaughey in old clothes, a pack slung over his shoulder, a smile on his face, boarding the airplane that will take him back to San Placebo where life is simpler and he can become a middle-school coach with perspective.The story doesn't link its episodes together very well but the pieces on occasion become works of art. Not majestic works of art, but not Grandma Moses either.",7,0,1,12 December 2014
Passengers," Hal Goes Ape!
","There is this titanic space ship carrying 5,000 hibernating passengers and crew on a 99-year journey from earth to a new planetary paradise. The nuclear-powered ship is run by a series of computers. Everyone is peacefully asleep, traveling through space at half the speed of light. So far, so good. Then -- well, think of it this way. Sometimes your computer develops idiopathic quirks and sometimes even crashes, doesn't it? Chris Pratt is waked up prematurely by a faulty chip or something, climbs out of his hibernation pod and finds himself all alone on a magnificently appointed but Listerianlly sterile space ship. Robots swirl around and serve him but the only robot he can speak to (and who can understand and reply) is the very human looking bartender, Arthur, who has the smooth, non-committal delivery of all good bartenders in first-class settings.Pratt, a mechanic, explores the ship but there's nothing he can do to get back to sleep, nor can he discover what went wrong and woke him up. A year of debauchery sensibly follows. When he's not playing basketball and working out, he's drunk in the Mexican cantina moaning for 'un autro cerveza.' Arthur sympathizes but after all he's just a robot with a fluid line of reassurance. Pratt winds up unkempt -- dressed in sweaty rags, bearded, and with long hair, he resembles Robinson Crusoe. Who can blame him? Arthur is the only other sentient being aboard and he certainly doesn't give a damn what Pratt looks like.Instead of shooting himself naked into outer space, Pratt learns how to wake up his fellow passenger, Jennifer Lawrence. It's a sound idea, except for the fact that now TWO of them will be stuck for 90 years aboard an otherwise empty vessel in space. Both will be dead long before the ship reaches its destination. What follows next is predictable. The romance has its ups and downs. The romance takes up about a third of the screen time and is followed by scenes in which the central computer, if there is one, goes ape. Frankly, some of the exposition lost me. The 'gravity center' shuts down and everything floats into the air, and comes perilously close to drowning Lawrence. But inasmuch as the ship is spinning, centrifugal force should keep everyone's feet firmly planted anyway, shouldn't it? In any case, the last third of the movie raises the tempo to agitato with sirens going off, alarm bells ringing, instruments whose shivering needles are climbing towards the red zones, and all that sort of thing. Not to worry though. This ship is titanic but not THE 'Titanic.' The nuclear neurosis is only an excuse for an extravaganza of special effects.The direction is unspectacular and for that, I think, we can all be grateful. The cameraman wasn't drunk. The production values are impressive even if the result lacks any poetry whatever. Pratt bears about as much resemblance to Patrick Swayze as Lawrence does to Reneé Zellwigger. As an actor, Pratt himself is neither here nor there, but Lawrence, her crossed eyes, and the throaty squeak in her voice, are endearing. Also her bosom, of which the director deprives us of even a glimpse. No wonder the world is going to hell in a handbasket.I wish them well in their 60 or 70 years together. I hope their marriage doesn't turn into the hellish experiences my six or seven did. And I hope they practice safe sex and use condoms because, should Lawrence become preggers, they have no way of waking up the docs or even the midwife. And I hope boredom doesn't overwhelm them because, after all, Arthur is nothing more than a pair of metallic legs beneath his bartender's jacket.",6,1,2,9 July 2017
Forgetting Sarah Marshall," Dullish collage of comic incidents.
","This film is reasonably highly rated by users here so I obviously missed something because it seemed patched together out of semi-independent events that were designed to be amusing but, to me, were for the most part pointless and unfunny.This nebbish who writes the score for a TV crime series (Jason Segel) is dumped by his hoarse-voiced petite blond girl friend Sarah Marshall (Kristen Bell), an actress on the show, and runs away to Hawaii to forget her. However, Bell shows up coincidentally at the same time and hotel, and with her new boyfriend, an English musician, Russell Brand. Segel keeps running into the pair each time he has dinner, drinks, surfs, takes yoga classes, or just walks around. He also meets a handful of weird, vaguely new-agey characters who use words like 'totally' and say things like, 'There's pain behind those eyes.' In the end, Bell and Brand break up. Bell wants to get it on again with Segel but he rejects her and goes back to Los Angeles. The end.I think what this film is trying to be is a refurbished 'There's Something About Mary,' although if you shook its family tree, 'Ten' might fall out of it. Example: After being jilted, Segel bawls abjectly, like an infant, in a public place, just like the protagonist of 'There's Something About Mary.' But all the incidents take place in an exotic beach setting, as in 'Ten.' The difference is that 'There's Something About Mary' had a plot that developed, that led somewhere. One incident followed and depended upon some previous incident, and the story thickened. Another example: The TV show that Segel and Bell work for is canceled. And nothing happens. It leads nowhere, a dead end that simply fills up a bit of screen time. The impression left by 'Forgetting Sarah Marshall' is that of a padded-out episode from a situation comedy.In 'There's Something About Mary' we are interested in seeing what devious surprise lurks around the next corner. In 'Ten', the purpose of the film was to show us that when a middle-aged man tries to overcome his fear of maturity, it can work, though it may involve effort, pain, and humiliation. Here, I couldn't bring myself to be interested in what happened to any of the characters.It all seemed pointless, unless the point was to cash in on the success of the earlier comedies. There is a five-minute scene in a yoga class. Everyone else in the class is able to assume the positions with ease, but Segel has to struggle to do, say, a tripod handstand, though he succeeds in the end. So? Best performances in the sense that they were least abrasive: Segel and Rand. Segel is flabby and giddy, one foot in some other self-obsessed dimension, like a half-gassed Judge Reinhold. Rand gives us a nicely honed portrait of a hairy, tattooed bloke who is a paragon of good will.The version I saw was unrated but it's hard to imagine why. It's hardly erotic. There is some male nudity which, I admit, I found gratuitous and objectionable. I wouldn't have found female nudity gratuitous and objectionable though.I'd advise a pass on this one, despite its overall good ratings. If you are the sort who would find this amusing, then you might want not only to forget Sarah Marshall but to ablate her entirely and go directly to the sources, 'There's Something About Mary' and 'Ten.' Why settle for this pinchbeck ripoff?",3,5,11,18 February 2009
12 Monkeys," Slippery Time-Travel Conundrum.
","I have a feeling there is a lot of substance in this film. I wish I could say I got it, but I didn't. Maybe I glanced away from the screen too often or something. The story seemed to meander around through time and space and maybe one or two other dimensions known only to the director, Terry Gilliam. (By the way, it's anything but funny.) Bruce Willis is sent back from the future, as in 'The Terminator,' but without any ability to alter the future, only the capacity to learn from the past and report back to the future world in which he originated. (Got that? Good.) On one of his first, mis-directed trips, he winds up in 1990 being treated by psychiatrist Madeleine Stowe, whom I would have been pleased to treat me, even if only for a hangnail. Brad Pitt shows up as a super-animated fellow patient. Willis is somehow jerked into 1996, where he again runs into Stowe and this time kidnaps her as a kind of living tourist guide.I kept watching what seemed to me to be a pretty slipshod and ill thought-out movie because the acting is rather good. Bruce Willis, whatever else he may be, is no narcissist. He's made to be dumpy, shaved bald, tattooed, and dressed like a homeless bag man. (Everyone else seems to dress in rags too. The fashion seems to fit the physical milieu in which everything, whatever the time period, is broken, jagged, wet, and made out of junk -- even the scientific laboratories.) Stowe doesn't have to act much to be magnetic but she fits the role alright. Brad Pitt is a manic loony and puts more into it than he has in some other roles.I said before that it wasn't a comedy. But it's more than just not a comedy. It's tragic, as I suppose it's armature is supposed to be. Why else the allusions to 'Vertigo'?",4,5,19,6 October 2007
Mississippi Burning," Nice drama, conjectural history.
","Willem DaFoe is a by-the-book FBI investigator and is assisted by ex-Southern-sheriff Gene Hackman in the real-life inquiry into the deaths of three civil rights workers in Mississippi in 1964. The three kids disappeared. No one, black or white, is willing to cooperate with the 'Hoover boys' that poke around in the small town's business. The blacks won't cooperate because they're afraid, the whites for more obvious reasons. And some less obvious ones. As the clued-in Hackman puts it, 'They have to live here long after we're packed up and gone.' Just about every character is a stereotype that's played out like a card in a hand of bridge. The head of the local Ku Klux Klan, who calls himself 'a local businessman' is a balding nincompoop who hates not just blacks but Papists and Jews and probably Brobdignagians. He doesn't have a family. Not even a dog or a cat as far as we can tell. The other heavies, including the prototypical redneck Michael Rooker with his frozen sneer, don't have families either, except for Deputy Brad Dourif, who has a wife. But he only has a wife so that the movie can show us that not all Southern whites are murdering racists. Some are sweet and lovable and attractive, in the way that Carol Burnett is attractive, and, as just about sublimely played by Frances McDormand, are so haunted by distaste for these illegal caste-ridden shenanigans that she's able and willing to squeal to Gene Hackman's FBI agent about the murders. That indiscretion gets her clobbered.The performances are all good and some are splendid. Hackman could not be better. Every move he makes, every line of dialog, carries weight. DaFoe's character is less colorfully delineated. McDormand is outstanding, and so are Rooker, Dourif, and the guy who plays the KKK head. (What a trio of villains.) The tobacco-chewing Sheriff is great in a small supporting role.When the FBI is stretched to its official limits without results, Hackman is given license to use his own methods. Enter two unofficial FBI heavies. One is a balding red-head with bulging eyes who has since made a career out of playing serial murderers. The other is a huge black guy with an ominous and resonant baritone who threatens to castrate the Mayor unless he spills the beans, which the Mayor does, leading to almost all the desired convictions.The direction is tasteful. When the decomposing corpses are uncovered, it's in long shot. When Dourif beats hell out of McDormand, we only get a few introductory blows before the cut, just so we know what's going to happen next.Location shooting is evocative. It's a convincing small Southern town shimmering in the summer heat. Most 'Southern' scene -- the silent guy on the Choctaw reservations who is carving up catfish. The characters, although they may as well carry sandwich boards advertising their function in the script, are pretty well drawn.If there's a problem with the film it's that it is laid out like a dramatic movie in the usual form of rising climaxes. The payoffs towards the end simply don't fit in with the otherwise realistic depiction of events. I did not for a moment believe that undercover FBI agents were brought in to kidnap the Mayor and threaten to cut off his family jewels. That belongs to a movie script, or to some black hole of a CIA prison in Bulgaria, not to a narrative that purports to be based on an historic event.The final impression the film leaves you with is how surprisingly easy it is for a deeply felt and thoroughly entrenched set of values to change so quickly. A generation has passed, only a generation, since the governor of Mississippi's neighboring state stood in the doorway of the university and proclaimed, 'Segregation now, segregation tomorrow, segregation forever.' The situation displayed here, in 1964, isn't perfect now. Nothing is perfect. But it's a hell of a lot better than it was then. This is actually a curiously mixed blessing. It leaves Southern white people with still another defeat that they must get over. And it leaves blacks with a great deal of anti-white resentment that has no place to go.",7,10,17,13 April 2007
The 13th Warrior," Here's To Níðhöggr.
","A nice, high-echelon, young Arab (Banderas) is sent as an emissary to the Bulgars in 922 AD. At the time, the Middle East was the center of civilization. While Europeans were living on a flat earth, the people of Egypt were measuring its circumference. They invented soap. They also invented algebra, for which may God forgive them.Banderas is more or less shanghaied into joining a band of Norsemen returning to their home to protect it against the people of the mist, the Wendlos. I don't know if the Wendlos existed or not but they do in this movie.Banderas is revolted by the slovenliness of the Vikings. And who can blame him. They pass around a bowl to wash their faces in, but they also spit in it and one guy blows his nose into it using the one-nostril side slip method. But, like a good cultural anthropologist, he adapts to the ways of his hosts without trying to convert them to his religion or his customs.I was watching this on YouTube and at this point, Disney blocked the middle third of the film because of some copyright dispute. Therefore, it appears, I missed Diane Venora, which is a damned shame. Although, come to think of it, they could have used Mia Maestro because they look so much alike. I wonder if they are one and the same person. Has anyone ever seen Venora and Maestro together in the same room at the same time? No? I thought not.The ending is a sword-slinging bash in the rain and the mud. The Wendlos are all bundled up in bear costumes and whatnot so it's hard to tell whether they're supposed to be human or not. Someone has suggested they were Neanderthals but that's out of the question. It's out of date by some 50,000 years for one thing.Guess who wins the slogging match? RIGHT, the Norsemen and Banderas, fighting the enemy together, drenched in blood. The Vikings were pretty destructive when you get right down to it but they left us a few souvenirs -- 'skiff', 'shirt,' 'Thursday', 'Friday,' and so on.",6,0,4,28 September 2016
Argo," In The Beginning, There Was the Shah.
","It's an important movie because the incident that began this whole Middle East muddle in which we now find ourselves -- let's think of it as the index incident -- is fast disappearing down the memory hole. The Iranian takeover of the U.S. embassy in Teheran in 1979 is as remote from younger Iranis as the Vietnam war is to our college students. It's something they read about in history books. The mutual enmity has become functionally autonomous; it's an ongoing thing and now feels as if it's always been there.So it's important if only for its educational value. It's also a suspenseful story in itself. While the enraged Iranis storm the American embassy and occupy it, six of the staff escape out the back door and are finally given safe quarters in the house of the Canadian ambassador, while the rest of the staff are not so lucky. No one has any idea of what will happen to the six escapees. They could be caught and murdered momentarily. And they have no way of getting out of the country.Enter Ben Affleck as Tony Mendez, intrepid agent of the CIA, whose book this screenplay is based on, alas. I hope no one expects a personal memoir by a CIA hero to reflect any characterological weaknesses such as self doubt or vanity or hesitancy or fear. Affleck is grimly determined throughout, despite the company's attempts to shut the operation down. 'I will get you out. That's what I do,' he tells his terrified wards repeatedly. The outrageous plan is to give the six Americans new identities as location scouts for a film company.The script, and Affleck's performance, turns Mendez into a cipher. He seems to have only one trait -- that obsession to get them out. But then the script doesn't give any of the six hostages any personality either. They each have one trait, if that many, and are otherwise impossible to distinguish from one another. Well, that's not entirely true, because you can tell the men from the women.The story itself is intrinsically strong. The problems of getting a new identity and fooling the house-to-house Irani searchers at the airport, are spelled out in a jumbled kind of way. But Affleck, the director, and his cameraman seem to have caught some sort of palsy that has been endemic in Hollywood for the last decade or more.The hand-held camera is hardly ever still. The cuts come quickly, one upon the other. There are swish pans, wobbles, innumerable close ups of static faces where there need be no close ups at all. That's during the contemplative periods. During the action scenes, forget it -- a kaleidoscope of flashing images. As a result, the movie has taken on some of the visual qualities of a rock video, or a TV commercial for pimple cream, exercycles, or SUVs with Ma Deuces on top. ZOOM, BANG, Ooops, pardon me! The stylistic quirks juice up a story that needs no more juice than it already has. A suspense thriller doesn't need to convince us that it's supposed to be thrilling. I mean, cf., 'All The President's Men', and count the close ups and wobbles.But the directorial and editing style may just be trying to keep pace with the headlong layout of exposition. A brief but very valuable and dispassionate historical introduction is quickly tossed aside in favor of in favor of shots in which some Suit rushes into an office somewhere, grabs a phone and shouts, 'WHAT? They can't DO that!' And I couldn't tell who 'they' were or what they weren't supposed to do.Except for Affleck's robotic honcho, the performances are okay, and some are better than that. Thank God for Alan Arkin and John Goodman, who inject a necessary dose of humor and cynicism into the movie. Even without them, the movie would have been better than the average junk pouring out of the studios, if only because of its political and historical significance. Yet, I'm getting awfully tired of being yanked by the ear from one place to another. Why don't 'they' take a breather and watch 'Lawrence of Arabia' again?",7,3,4,7 September 2013
12 Angry Men," Finely tuned
","First of all, what a cast! Fonda doesn't seem like much of a New Yorker, but the rest of the cast reads like a Who's Who in New York movies. All of them except Sweeney and Voscovek went on to lengthy careers in character and support roles.The plot comes from a TV show and is very tightly written. There's hardly a wasted word or an unnecessary gesture. This has its drawbacks because it imposes a dramatic frame on the characters and the development. There's not much sense of 'real life' here. Everything fits together too neatly for that. But if events follow earlier events with a logic that is a bit obvious, it's forgivable because the screenplay is done so well. Like 'Stagecoach,' it may be mechanical but it's as finely tuned as a good wristwatch.Also more or less unavoidable in a short movie dealing with a dozen often conflicting characters is the reduction in their complexity. Each is a stereotype. They practically wear sweatshirts with logos on them. 'I AM A SHALLOW AD MAN.' 'BORED MARMALADE SALESMAN HERE.' 'KICK ME, I AM AN IGNORANT RACIST.' They are capable of changing their opinions but they show only one side of their characters.A third unfortunate quality in the script is that it is imbued with what Tom Wolfe referred to as 'nostalgie de la bou' -- a kind of admiration for the lowbrow. Pauline Kael made the same observation back in the early 60s in an essay called 'Fantasies of the Art House Audience.' What it boils down to is a dislike of the middle-class. Fonda is an architect, a professional. The other good guys in the movie are members of minority groups or ordinary working stiffs with slum backgrounds. The two most repulsive villains (Ed Begley and Lee J. Cobb) are self-made men who run their own successful businesses. The rufescent Begley has a line, something like, 'I got ten factories going to pot while we're talking' here.' Cobb brags about how he built up his delivery business starting out with nothing. A third dummy is a SALESMAN -- of marmalade! (Yukk.)Okay. That gets pretty much all of the weaknesses out of the way. The pluses outweigh the minuses by exactly two short tons. The acting is almost impossible to improve upon, not surprisingly. It's unfair to single out Jack Warden and Martin Balsam for their performances but I'll do it anyway.The photography, by Boris Kaufman, is perceptive and adds to the tension, the feeling of claustrophobia. Especially memorable is the scene in which most of the jurors are standing together, there is a rumble of thunder, and a shadow falls gloomily over the group. It's a small touch but palpable.Lumet manages to suggest New York City effectively in this crowded room, practically the only set. (There is a shot at the end that is done on the steps of the real Courthouse.) Lumet's direction makes the most of his actors' talents. The pauses in their arguments last just long enough for us to take a few breaths.Rose's script avoids an easy ending. Yes, there is reasonable doubt enough for the verdict to turn out as it does, but there is no dramatic introduction of crucial evidence to demonstrate that the defendant is innocent. Did he do it? We don't know. Suppose the kid actually did it and gets away with it? Fonda is twice challenged on that point -- once at the table and once in the men's room -- and in neither instance does he have a reply.Overall, it's a marvelous movie, a lesson in acting, directing, writing, and shooting. The recent updated version has been made politically correct but is not an improvement over this original. See it if you have the chance.",8,5,6,11 November 2003
The English Patient," Haunted Pasts.
","Ralph Fiennes is the English patient. It's World War II and he's been burned to one of those scarred, blue-white human simulacra who is slowly dying. His nurse, Juliette Binoche, keeps him pumped up with morphine in a half-ruined abbey.Willem Dafoe is a dope addict who holds Fiennes responsible for his torture by the Germans, particularly by a villainous German officer in a fine performance by Jurgen Prochnow. Prochnow's use of torture offends even his own men, who deferentially bring up the Geneva Conventions, never having had the advice of the White House Office of Legal Counsel. Aside from providing the opportunity for a terrible torture scene, it was never really clear to me what Dafoe's mission in the movie was.Fiennes, immobilized in bed, has carried with him a copy of Herodotus, 'the Father of History'. For Fiennes, history is a nightmare from which he is trying to awake. Between Dafoe's quiet interrogations and the mementos Fiennes carried within the tattered pages of Herodotus, the English patient is haunted by past sins, some worthier than others, and finally, with minimal gestures, persuades Binoche to put him to sleep.That's the fictional present in war-blasted Italy. Meanwhile, Fiennes is narcotized to the extent that his chthonic memories are turned into flashbacks -- of friendships he's betrayed, of his love for the lost Lenore, of his minor indiscretions and major screw ups, and of the futility of every effort he's made, except for a few momentary passions.Fiennes has been through a lot in the years between 1939 and 1945 and you get to see much of it. The Tunisian desert is a magnificent landscape -- not so much flat and shimmering with heat, as in 'Lawrence of Arabia' but criss-crossed by ridges and pillars of a rich rust. The performances are smooth and convincing. The first time I saw the movie, I almost nodded off a few times. Fiennes' haunted past got to me. My own past has enough ghosts. But, wisely, the script has enough tautly done suspense and action sequences that it keeps even lowbrows like myself awake. One of the scenes, of an old-fashioned biplane plowing into the earth accidentally, comes and goes in a few seconds but is excellently shot. Overall, though, the movie might have profited from more such scenes, since it's still pretty sluggish.",7,0,2,18 February 2013
Public Enemies," Rat-a-tat-tat.
","Michael Mann made a taut and colorful movie about a gang of thieves, 'Heat,' some years ago but, boy, this is familiar material.Johnny Depp is John Dillinger, public enemy number one in the early 30s. Everyone knows his face and name. Marion Cotillard is his moll, to whom he returns whenever the story needs a break to allow the wreathes of gun smoke to clear. Christian Bale is Dillinger's chief nemesis, his Jabert, as it were, named Melvin Purvis, who is ordered by J. Edgar Hoover, President-for Life of the FBI, to track down Dillinger and bring him to justice. Assorted miscreants like Alvin Karpis, Frank Nitti, Louis Piquett, Pretty Boy Floyd, Baby Face Nelson, and Jo-Jo the Dog Faced Boy show up in minor parts.It should have been called 'The John Dillinger Story' and it would have made a good 1930s B feature or a Roger Corman cheapie from the early 60s, which, maybe, it was. It's all about Dillinger and his travails. Depp plays him as a go-getter unconcerned about the past. (What keeps him awake at night? 'Coffee.') He wisecracks with the press and becomes something of a public hero, along the lines of Bonny and Clyde.Christian Bale as the G-Man is efficient, ruthless, humorless, relentless, and a bit of a brute. He beats hell out of prisoners to get information. But, well, come to think of it, he has certain limited gentlemanly qualities. When he finds one of his agents -- a jutting chinned, beefy, pig-eyed guy -- using the petite French actress Marion Cotillard as a punching bag, he puts a stop to it. And we should note that when a captured criminal, a horribly wounded man with a bullet in his brain, is screaming with pain and begging for a shot from the doctor, Bale turns away as one of his men chokes some information out of the bad guy. Purvis is strictly a one-note character.But, really, don't expect much new here. Purvis gained so much notoriety from his exploits that the media-hogging J. Edgar Hoover demoted him and Purvis resigned from the FBI in 1934. The gun battles are frequent, though sometimes clumsily staged, and you've seen them all in one or another form before. The Tommy guns chatter away with lightning speed but no recoil. You can hold it in one hand and spray bullets as if it were a garden hose or water pistol. And when two bank robbers are sitting around ruminating over a forthcoming job and one of them says, 'I got a feeling I'm not going to make it this time' -- do you think he makes it? It's not a terrible movie. It doesn't insult the audience. It doesn't shove a viewer's face into the pain and the gore. It's just that it's all so awfully old.",5,0,0,25 July 2010
The Other Boleyn Girl," It's GOOD to be the king.
","An uninspired title for a lavish royal story of intrigue, ambition, lust, power, mishigas, and witchery, bitchery, block. There were two Bolyn girls, you see -- Scarlett Johanssen as shy Mary Bolyn, with her exquisitely misshapen features, and Natalie Portman as Anne, girlish and grasping. The Bolyns, like the royal family itself, is full of knaves. I mean, imagine a father pimping off his two daughters, even to a Eric Bana's king. Henry VIII (ruled 1509 -1547) is Eric Bana, who gives a subdued performance compared to, say, Charles Laughton or Robert Shaw. Henry ran through six wives, enough that a mnemonic peg has proved itself useful over the years: King Henry VIII, To six wives he was wedded. One died, one survived, Two divorced, two beheaded.This movie deals with the first two -- Catherine of Aragon of Spain, who stubbornly refuses to give Henry a son and heir but becomes instead the mother of Mary Queen of Scots, perhaps out of spite. The marriage is annulled, a great shock at the time, and the actress, the magnificent Ana Torrent, gives the role all she's got. But as Catherine approaches menopause after twenty-four years of marriage, the frustrated younger Henry has had enough. Catherine leaves the court in a high dudgeon, dies later in prison, and Henry takes up with shy Mary, she of the low dudgeon but high bosom, of which the viewer gets not a glimpse. Now, I'm describing the movie, not the historical facts because I'm unable to remember anything that happened before I was five years old. In any case, Mary and Henry get along quite well, although of course they aren't married. The men of the court, especially Boleyn pater, are anxious to see Mary become queen. The dialog is exceptional when the nobles question Mary about her first night. 'Did he lie with you?' 'Yes, he lay with me.' 'Did he lie with you more than once?' 'Yes, he lay with me more than once.' It was enough. She gives birth -- but to a girl, not a boy. The end credits tell us that this is, in fact, the case and that the girl grew up to be Elizabeth I -- the Elizabethan Age of Shakespeare, Sir Francis Drake, the Spanish Armade, Errol Flynn, et al. I understand the claim is in some dispute.The king sheds Mary, though. First of all, he's not keen on baby girls as heirs, though he's willing enough to give it another go. 'Well, if she can bear a healthy baby girl, she can bear a healthy baby boy.' He's put off the scent by the conations of Mary's sister Anne. It's hard to tell from the film whether Anne is deliberately trying to undo Mary's position, which has seemed secure. The king is tender with Mary and she has grown to love him. In any case, Anne enters the king's affections kind of crabwise, which isn't hard since Anne is beautiful and flirtatious while the king seems to be ruled entirely by his glands. As history has shown, Anne has made a big mistake and is succeeded by Jane Seymour, the wife from whom the actress (née Joyce Penelope Wilhelmina Frankenberg) copped her name.All of the performances are up to par, as is the direction. Scarlett Johansson gives the most notable performance, possibly because it's the most complex, whereas Portman is shackled to the role of bitch with mute. We don't see that much of Eric Bana as Henry, but he joins all the men of the story in being scheming and unscrupulous brutes. Not that the women are much better, with the exceptions of shy Mary and proud Catherine. I kind of enjoyed it, although if you stripped the story of its historical roots and cut its budget by about 999,999% what you'd wind up with is something resembling a Lifetime Network Movie. You know, give the characters contemporary dress, get rid of the 'lie with's, and make the king a CEO, and there you have it.",6,0,0,19 November 2017
Elizabeth," Lonely at the Top.
","Elizabeth starts out as a gay young girl and winds up alone on a throne, painted like a corpse, omnipotent, friendless, full of tragic grandeur like Al Pacino at the end of The Godfather II. 'The Godmother'? No -- hardly that.This is the most complex of the few movies I've seen that deal with the reign of Elizabeth I. John Ford's 'Mary of Scotland' was really about Mary and its message was simple-minded: the Catholics were good and the Calvinists bad. In 'The Sea Hawk,' we learned that it was an almighty good thing for Flora Robson to have Errol Flynn on her side. Vanessa Redgrave, in 'Mary, Queen of Scots', taught us that the queen who leads with her head and not with her heart wins.'Elizabeth' doesn't have such an easily stated message. It's an expensive costume romantic drama that has dozens of characters and at least twice that many intrigues.As for the religious part of the conflict, the Catholics come off the worst, although the Protestants don't exactly shine either. A priest comes from France, murders people, and tries more than once to assassinate Elizabeth -- once by 'poisoning her dress.' (How do you do that?) And it's amazing, really, how many of the people Elizabeth has known all her life turn out to be secret Catholic traitors, hiding in holes and whatnot. The headsman is kept busy and the climax contrasts the executions and the lopped-off heads with the ritual purity of Elizabeth's coronation, again vide 'The Godfather.' Thinking it over, I'm not sure there is a moral behind this epic at all. Maybe, like 'The Godfather', it is meant to show us that it's powerful lonely at the top. It also twigs us to the fact that when Elizabeth is referred to as a 'virgin queen,' the term is used figuratively. I think, if I had been her counselor, I'd have had the answer to all the religious troubles and the competition with France, Scotland, and Spain and all that dreary stuff.I'd have made sure she married the incestuous, foolish Duc d'Anjou. Okay, he was a cross-dressing pouf, but so what? Elizabeth already spoke French, so the language wouldn't have been a problem. The Duc could have handled the money, and he would know where the best restaurants were hidden. And besides, in addition to getting an amusing sometime-lover, she would have had access to a region that cultivates fine pears and produces a respectable rosÃ©.Pshaw, you say. The marriage wouldn't have worked out. I reply: how many marriages do you know that DO work out? And there is always divorce, isn't there? After all, Elizabeth's Old Man invented it. Oh -- and another thing. If we're all going to conspire against one another and go about chopping off heads because of religious differences, let's get rid of religions. We could all become serious Pantheists. That would satisfy everybody, from the rabid Evangelicals to the Green Party.Some advice: After watching this movie, for a good tickle, go to some of the news boards and read all the venomous comments about how the Moslems keep fighting each other.But, all seriousness aside, the movie's worth seeing. The locations and production design are splendid. The music opulent. The acting just fine on everyone's part, including John Gielgud in a tiny unsympathetic role as the Pope. Cate Blanchett is luminously beautiful but not in a typical Hollywood way. She has a pale elongated face and an anole's eyes that are expressive slits. At its best, the film is an elaborate panorama and at it's least, an amuse-bouche.",6,0,1,21 February 2006
The Secret in Their Eyes," Very Nicely Executed Adult Murder Mystery.
","I'm glad they called this 'The Secret In Their Eyes' because the director, Campanella, has filled the film with close ups of the faces of people who are mostly lying or manipulative. Happily, he has abjured the usual sickening fads -- the wobbling camera, the instantaneous cuts, the desaturated ghoulish pallet, the revolver held sideways, the two-gun shoot out, the inappropriate wisecracks.Not that there aren't many exceedingly humorous moments sprinkled throughout the script, particularly in the first half. You have seen the detective too eager to solve the crime chewed out by his angry superior. Please don't trouble to deny it. You've seen it a thousand times. Often the miscreant is forced to hand over his piece and his shield. But you have never seen it done like this. I laughed all the way through it.Esposito's new boss in the Justice Office, a stern woman named Hastings, is a recent graduate of Cornell which, high as it is above Cayuga's waters, suffers a climate that practically makes cheer illegal. She gets Esposito and his drunken partner Sandoval out of trouble, she tells him, by exercising her social skills, her charm, and her irresistible smile. Thoroughly reamed out, Esposito is about to leave her office but turns and asks humbly, with her permission, what 'irresistable smile' is she talking about because he's never seen it.All this humor is written with the understanding that the audience will get it and it's delivered in a manner consistent with an adult audience. The same isn't true of all the comedy. Esposito and Sandoval illegally examine a woman's house. She returns unexpectedly and they are chased outside by a furious but tiny short-haired dog. They dash out the door, the barking dog in hot pursuit. When they're out of sight, we hear a yelp, and see the dog running back in.Well, one more example. His wife kicks out the drunken Sandoval and Esposito takes him into his apartment. Sandoval keeps stumbling into things. 'Too much furniture,' he complains. When Esposito tries to call Sandoval's wife and explain things, he finds that there is no answer because Sandoval's phone has been broken for a year. Esposito decides to drive to Sandoval's house and get the wife. 'Why not phone her?', asks Sandoval. Esposito: 'You just said your phone was broken.' A long pause and Sandoval replies with the logic of the inebriated, 'My phone IS broken, but yours isn't.' I don't want to get into the plot too much because it's complicated and has a couple of twists that no one could see coming. Some are, let's say, improbably. Having found that a murderer is a soccer fan, Esposito and Sandoval begin visiting games, which Esposito has no interest in. One game a week. Lo, on the fourth, they find themselves only a few seats away from the killer -- out of about 70,000 seats.The acting could hardly be improved on. Esposito has a face that challenges disbelief. He's modest and completely trustworthy. Sandoval never overplays the drunkenness. Hastings, the boss back at the DA's office, is middle-aged, pretty, and not knock-out beautiful like a movie star. Romano, Esposito's rival who chews him out, is hilarious before he turns to the dark side.Yes, it's true. You have to read the subtitles. And they're in the Argentine dialect too. But it's worth it. Everything about the film is admirable, including the photography and location shooting. Besides, you get to see what Buenos Aires looks like. It's arguably the most Europeanized city on the continent. And out in the boondocks, they drink mate. I believe you also get a glimpse of pampas grass, a fiendish growth that I had to fight weekly in my California back yard.",8,3,4,7 April 2011
Black Book," Excellent film about Dutch resistance.
","Says my TV guide, 'In World War II Holland, a woman of the Jewish resistance falls in love with the German officer she was sent to seduce.' That makes it sound like another sappy love story. We visualize the scene in which the luscious babe holds a trembling pistol against the head of her sleeping Nazi lover, her face a mask of anguish. 'Do I love him too much to kill him'? Actually, it's much more than that, a bitter and adult story of intrigue and betrayal among the Dutch resistance during the German occupation.Paul Verhoeven directed not only this highly European film but a number of American action movies as well, and he learned his commercial lessons in Hollywood, but he hasn't imported them to his native Holland. This isn't 'Robocop' or a Schwarzenegger Schlagfest by any means. Lots of nudity, yes, but mostly non-erotic -- and male as well as female. Sharon Stone may open her knees and cross her legs while half a dozen men goggle and lick their lips. Here, Clarice Van Houten bleaches her pubic hair on screen and nothing is made of it except that she is Jewish, has black hair, and is trying to make herself blond all over so as not to be found out.What horror. And it doesn't follow the usual trajectory, with a climactic shoot out at the end. Most of the good guys die before the end, except the ones who most deserve it. The German officer with whom Clarice falls in love (Jobst Schnibbe) is a fundamentally decent guy who, seeing the war's end, tries to prevent more bloodshed by arranging a truce with the Resistance. These kinds of stories generally call for him to die a heroic, self-sacrificing death, maybe in order to save the girl's life. But it doesn't happen. He dies alright, but only because he's caught, mistaken for a Nazi, and the Canadians who liberate the city permit a cooperative but still fascistic German to carry out the death sentence that has been imposed on Schnibbe. It's not a heroic death. Schnibbe is simply stood up against a stone wall and shot.If there's a problem with the film, it may be that Verhoeven has learned a little too much from Hollywood. The end of the war, and the liberation of Amsterdam by the British and Canadians, is followed by a lengthy story of mistaken intentions and Allied gloating that lead not just to Schnibbe's death but to the incarceration and humiliation of Clarice by a drunken Dutch rabble. I mean -- they dump a cauldron of human excrement on her, and the scene is drawn out until long after we've grasped the point. And there's a great deal of gun play. It seems to go on and on, while automatic weapons tear bodies apart.But this is no more a dumb action movie than it is a simple-minded love story. If it has its commercial elements, it at least is ambitious enough to reach for an audience of grown-ups who can understand the complexity of motives and of human nature.Every once in a while, during a pause in the narrative, I thought of Anne Frank and her family and friends, most of whom lived in Holland and died before the end of the war -- and of Audrey Hepburn too, who managed to live through it.",8,3,8,30 May 2008
Batman Returns," Was He Ever GONE?
","Gotham City is a majestic presence in this movie. It looks lavish enough for its budget to have fed the entire population of Upper Volta for a year.I kind of like it, mostly because it featured two of my costars, Michael Keaton in the superb art-house hit, 'Squeeze,' and Pat Hingle, who was my supporting player in the memorable, umm, whatever it was. It will come when it will come.Keaton is laid back, even a bit sluggish, as Bruce Wayne. Danny DeVito as the Penguin is not at all sluggish. He waddles around in a fat suit and wears enough makeup to disguise his human identity. Michelle Pfeiffer makes a sleek Cat Woman in a black plastic outfit. Christopher Walken in a gray wig stands out as a corrupt mayor. Christopher Walken always stands out.But what's it all about? It's all full of fireworks but it's not the Fourth of July, just a run of the mill Tuesday or something. Is it supposed to be sufficiently entertaining just to look at movie stars in costumes running around in expensive sets? I only ask because there's not much more to the film than that. And if that's your pleasure, you'll certainly find it here.",6,1,3,3 July 2016
The Great Dictator," Farce.
","Charlie has a dual identity. He looks like Hitler -- well, I'm going to use the real names of the satirized characters instead of Chaplin's rather silly ones. He also plays a Jewish barber just recovered from twenty years of amnesia. He returns to his little barber shop in the ghetto, not knowing that his Doppelganger has taken over the country and is persecuting the Jews. He develops an interest in the spunky and very pretty young Paulette Goddard. She's pretty highly evolved, compared to the other mousy residents. She wants everyone to stand up and fight against the Storm Troopers, even if their shops and fruit stands are destroyed. 'What good is money?' she shouts. Good question. When Paulette Goddard died about fifteen years ago she left the mass of her estate to New York University.I wish I could endorse this comic sermon without qualification but I can't. It's not as funny as it should be. There's little in the way of Chaplin's usual superb choreography. There's the scene in which he plays with a light-as-air balloon of the globe, but it doesn't compare to, say, the scene in the tilting cabin in 'The Gold Rush.' And there's a scene in which he shaves a customer, suiting the actions of the razor to the tune of one of the Hungarian Dances. Maybe that's where they got the idea for the Tom and Jerry cartoons that used the same gag.Chaplin here deals with a genuine catastrophe -- the genocidal programs of the Nazis -- but doesn't slather the message with easy sentiment, thank God. Of course, in 1940, the world already knew of concentration camps but few had a very clear idea of the magnitude of the horrors. The German occupation of Poland was also satirized, in a far more sophisticated way, in Ernst Lubitsch's 'To Be Or Not To Be.' Chaplin's movie is, in a way, more courageous in bringing the problems of the Jews to center stage, not just the Poles. That candor probably didn't help him when he was kicked out of the US for 'communist' leanings.I'm trying to avoid the use of the term 'old fashioned' but it's difficult. Paulette Goddard's downtrodden status is signaled by her wearing of nice clean rags and a simple, and rather becoming, smudge on one cheek. Make up in general is overdone. It's as if the audience were assumed to be locked into 1915, when such excesses were called for. Chaplin probably should have quit after 'Modern Times.' His voice isn't really suited to sound movies and by this time, maybe, his inventiveness was flagging. How much brilliant stuff can one man put on the screen over the course of twenty-five years? This one is for kids, the kind who like The Three Stooges, but sadly the kids won't get many of the jokes.",5,8,18,4 December 2010
Hot Fuzz," Does Civilization Need Another Slasher Parody?
","Simon Pegg is a police sergeant from London who transfers to the force of a small and beautiful English village that has virtually no crime but an extraordinarily high rate of death by accident. Pegg becomes convinced that the many bizarre accidental deaths are no accident, that there is a connection of some kind, and that they are actually homicides, but nobody in the village or on the police force believes him.So far, this is familiar serial-killer territory. And it's supposed to be. It's a send up of every such film you've ever seen, with parodic elements of other genres thrown in for good measure. The musical score is a blitz that pounds us into insensibility. The editing is lightning fast. I don't keep track of these things but I could identify absurd rip-offs of John Woo, Sergio Leone, Disraeli Gears, Sam Pekinpah ('Straw Dogs' in particular: one man trap and one shooting-off-the-foot-by-shotgun) and I don't know how many other elements of vernacular culture. They blended into one another, sometimes not so smoothly, and not just on the screen but in my by-now befuddled long-term memory.Oddly, the acting is pretty good. Simon Pegg has the face of everyman. Timothy Dalton is splendid showing the hidden menace in his crocodile smile. And the dialog shows a good deal of sometimes keen wit. In the midst of the inevitable bloody, climactic shoot out, the local minister emerges from his church, his arms outspread, trembling and appealing for peace and love instead of all this violence. Rejected, he exclaims, 'Oh, **** off, then,' draws two pistols and begins shooting.I don't know. I guess it's my problem. But the fact is that the kinds of movies this film satirizes are so dumb, so repetitive and formulaic, that they are parodies sufficient unto themselves. But if you enjoyed the originals, you'll probably get a kick out of this. It's good natured. I prefer 'Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein,' but of course it's all a matter of taste.",5,9,23,2 August 2008
The Mummy," A Curse on He Who Violates This Tomb.
","The degree to which you'll enjoy this movie depends a lot on how much -- and why -- you like 'Raiders of the Lost Ark.' Without 'Raiders', this movie wouldn't exist. Neither would 'Romancing the Stone,' 'The Jewel of the Nile,' and the numerous sequels in the Indiana Jones series.'Raiders of the Lost Ark' was a true original, the brainchild of Stephen Spielberg, based on the silly, action-filled serials of the 1930s and 40s. There can only be one original, and that was it.As is always the case, the imitations gave us more of what audiences found appealing in the original. Not only more, but much more. Often, too much more.In 'Raiders', the archaeologist hero had to beat the Nazis in finding the Lost Ark of the Covenant. Here, the hero, Frazier, has to beat a bunch of greedy Americans looking for treasure. Frazier is funded by Weisz's library. Unlike Indiana Jones, he has no particular profession. No identity, really, beyond that of the figure who must save the delicious Rachel Weisz when she is strapped down on an altar of rock next to a disgusting mummy who is brought to life.'Raiders' didn't have CGIs but 'The Mummy' certainly does. The mummies march around in cadence, holding shields and swords, a rip off of Ray Harryhausen's skeleton fight from 'Jason and the Argonauts.' But if you like action, you'll get it here. And some of it revolting enough to be thoroughly enjoyable. Nothing I like better than seeing a man eaten alive by overgrown cockroaches. Frazier jumps around, a pistol in each hand, wearing a 1920s outfit with crossed holsters and boots. ('Raiders' was set in the 30s.) Frazier gapes, she shouts warning, he makes wisecracks with his eyeballs bulging. Weisz has opportunities to look flabbergasted and frightened. Gawd, she's pretty. She has a delightfully wide face, broad nose, scintillating smile, and eyes that belong in a museum.The thing is, though, the thing that keeps this from being better appreciated than it is, at least by me, is that it's a copy of something else. People sat down and STUDIED 'Raiders of the Lost Ark,' trying to figure out what it was that made it so successful, so enjoyable -- what it was that raked in all those SHEKELS. For one thing to be 'influenced' by something that came earlier is both understandable and inevitable. But for something to be deliberately copied in the pursuit of pelf. To me, that's almost as sphincter-puckering a notion as being eaten alive by giant cockroaches. I guess that's why I never got rich.",Null,0,0,17 July 2011
Constantine," Purgatorio
","There is a scene in this movie in which a detective with supernatural powers uses a cat as a portal into Hell. I turned to my cat, Josefina, usually keen on the heuristics of these things, and asked if she found this in any way offensive. 'Absolutely,' she replied, turning her eyes from the screen in disgust. I gave it a good mulling-over that night, and the next day asked Josefina if she would have found it more acceptable if the portal to hell had been provided by another animal -- say, a dog -- but by that time the effects of my herbal psychotropics had worn off and, if Josefina answered, I didn't hear it.Rachel Weisz plays a nice Catholic girl who's sister has apparently committed suicide. Weisz wants her buried in sacred ground, though, and she knows her sister would never kill herself. So she turns to Ke'anu Reeves, who has a reputation for knowing stuff about the supernatural.It turns out he knows quite a lot. There are angels in Heaven and devils in Hell. The problem is they can't pass into the realm of the quotidian, so they send 'half breeds,' half-angels or half-devils, whose powers are limited to 'whispering in our ears.' Or so he says. Some of them resemble Harpies of Greek mythology or horrible deformed creatures out of 'The Garden of Earthly Delights.' Considering that they're limited to merely whispering, they do a good job of throwing bodies around and filling the streets with flapping bat-like wings.I won't go on about it. The movie stinks. The dialog has lines like, 'You're trying to buy your way into Heaven.' And, 'God is a kid with an ant farm.' (Actually, come to think of it, that last one is pretty funny but I don't think it was meant to be.) The wind-up is that Reeves gives Weisz a crash course in the writer's version of how things work in this all-too-Christian cosmology and, expectably, it's all an excuse to hang a lot of computer-generated effects on. There are no surprises. The only thing that could have saved this trite piece of trash would have been the introduction of an Eskimo cosmology, with Hell consisting of seven levels of cold, and Sedna lording it over all.Reeves, in poor fettle, rarely departs from his imitation of a mahogany idol. Rachel Weisz is more animated, a better actress, and beautiful in a not-quite Hollywood way.My recommendation: Something is whispering in my ear. It's saying, 'Don't bother.'",3,0,1,25 October 2008
The Natural," Spectacular Catch by Levinson!
","I don't know why I enjoy this movie as much as I do. I haven't cared about baseball much since I was ten years old and this isn't Redford's best performance. Let me get the weaknesses out of the way first. The story is an ur-sports one. Act One: Prodigy is discovered. Act Two: Tragedy leads to slump. Act Three: Protagonist overcomes demons and wins the game (or bout, or chukkar, or whatever). Subordinate characters are largely quirky stereotypes. There is an over-obvious mythological overlay that's more pretentious than anything else. During dramatic moments, the score swells to heroic proportions to an extent that we almost expect a cut to Moses's parting of the Red Sea. The slow-motion not only signals a triumph in the making but allows us to relish it for a few seconds longer. Let's see. I guess that about covers most of the reasons not to like the film. But these flaws are pretty much overcome by its virtues. When the score isn't alter-casting us as worshipers it has a nice slangy period feel to it. During the periods of defeat the score never becomes maudlin. It retains a kind of tinkly offhand quality but sounds a bit slower in tempo, imbued with a hardly noticeable melancholy. The photography is first rate. It has the same tawny quality that has cropped up in lesser works like 'The Fortune' or 'W. C. Fields and Me.' Everyone seems burnished by the sun. There is an early scene, shot late in the afternoon, in which tiny, white, feathery pappus drift slowly in the air like motes, and each figure wears a golden nimbus. When Glenn Close needs to be inspirational, she stands upright and is engulfed in a mandriole of gilded flame, a little overdone.And the period detail is evocative without being obtrusive. A slow-motion shot of a dying flashbulb signals the beginning of Redford's career slump. The light-bulb-as-career works well, as it did for Scorcese and for Orson Welles in 'Citizen Kane.' The lighting and photography are warm and welcoming and exceptionally skillful. The story follows the three-act pattern, except that it doubles it by giving us two tragedies instead of one, so you get twice as much for your money, and Hobbs has double the number of demons to cope with. (First he gets shot -- in a theme I must say I didn't completely understand -- then he falls for Lillith instead of whoever the muse of the game of baseball is.) The acting? As I say, Redford in the central role is a bit too minimized, or maybe it's the wrong kind of role for him, although he looks the part of the fit athlete perfectly -- sinuously muscled instead of bulging all over with sarcomeres. Of course his real background in baseball must have helped his physical performance. He looks right. I wish he had projected a little more concern about his slump. He's pretty casual about the whole thing. 'Whatever's wrong, it's not the bat,' he shrugs. Glenn Close is good, as usual, although surely such companions don't exist. Kim Basinger, later to be my co-star, looks ravishing. Duval, another co-star, turns in his usual superior performance, an arid chuckle, smiling, his mouth open, villainous. The other players are equally good, locked as some are into one-dimensional roles. I particularly enjoy the pizazz that Darren McGavin brings to his part of the antagonistic gambler. It's his best role in years. He's philosophical about losing, charming, full of casual jokes. The restaurant scene in which he pops out his eye is amusing and slightly frightening at the same time. The judge, despite his greed and underhandedness, is amusing too. He speaks in the pompous Gongoristic prose you'd expect from someone who used to sit on the bench and is accustomed to demonstrating how superior he is to most mortals. 'A canard -- a pure canard.' Brimley and Farnsworth are a pair of aces as they try to deal with the newly arrived middle-aged rookie, or sit together on the bench while each tries to name the song the other is humming. (This was a touch added by Levinson when he noticed the two of them doing it between takes.) Yes, it has all those weaknesses. But it's the kind of movie that doesn't repay much analysis. Anybody up for deconstructing 'Duck Soup'? It's extremely easy to sit back and be drawn into this story because it is, in so many ways, admirably done.",7,0,3,3 October 2002
Troy," How do you like them Golden Apples?
","The movie is colossal, spectacular, stupendous, gongoristic, monumental, and secular.What happened to the GODS? I mean the whole thing started with Eris and that damme golden apple and vain Aprhodite -- whom I would not want backing me in a war, I'll tell you. Yes. It's a godless movie, no doubt propagated by some leftist Commies in Hollywood. Oh, sure. Lots of people entreat the gods, or propitiate them, or insult them, but does anything happen as a result? They don't. No, they don't. You may call it secular humanism but I call it hubris.The best thing about the movie is Peter O'Toole. He practically gives acting lessons to the leads. Brad Pitt I feel kind of mixed about. He's not bad actually -- humorless, narcissistic, and relentless except when he's in a snit. By the way, didn't Achilles hide in drag among the women in order to avoid being drafted? Maybe not. My memory is a little rusty after all these years. I didn't have a problem with Brad Pitt, the actor, but rather with his role as written and directed. We already know that Achilles is full of love for himself, but must we be too? Pitt is all pumped up and musclebound and the camera gives us more than one shot of his bare behind. That's okay as far as it goes because the Greeks were pretty casual about nudity ('gymnasium', etc.) but then, well -- why not a bit more of Helen too? Or Briseis? What's the matter with their behinds? Speaking of Briseis, the erstwhile temple virgin with whom Achilles falls in love, brings up a couple of creaky places in the construction of the story. Alright, they don't have to hew too closely to Homer's original. He probably didn't hew very closely either. After all it was an oral tradition and there wasn't too much to hew to. But the introduction of the romance between Achilles and Briseis, which I don't remember being in The Iliad, almost turns the movie into a Harlequin romance punctuated by scenes of battle and intrigue. In fact all the romances are handled through dialog that is positively an embarrassment. Near the beginning Paris sneaks into Helen's room and she says, 'You shouldn't be here.' Paris: 'That's what you said last night.' Helen: 'Last night was a mistake.' I kept waiting for one of the lovers to turn to the other and say, 'We have to talk.' At least the Helen/Paris romance was required. Her sleek Teutonic beauty is what launched those thousand ships. But Achilles and Briseis is off track. It's the story of a man who 'found himself' through the love of a good woman. (Ho hum.) It turns out, according to this version of the story, that Paris didn't shoot Achilles with an arrow before the walls of Troy after all. Instead Achilles is killed because he foolishly rushes around the burning palace searching for Briseis, his missing love. When Briseis yields to him and agrees to leave, he sweeps her up in his brawny arms and Paris, mistaking this for a coerced abduction, plugs him in the heel. There follow the few last words to his lost love, from a man who died tragically just as he found the true meaning of life. The real Achilles must be begging the boatman to take him back across the Styx so he can strangle the writers.Visually of course the movie is overwhelming. Maybe too much so. We see a horde of about two thousand Greeks in dark armor plodding relentlessly towards Troy, while ominous music throbs in the background. It owes something to the score for Alexander Nevsky, but if you're going to rip somebody off it might as well be Prokoviev. The fact is, there are too many guys. In The Iliad Homer gives us two lines of warriors -- the Greeks and Trojans -- shouting insults and shaking spears at one another until some of them rush out of line to do battle. This puts the spotlight on individual mano a mano combat, like that between Hector and Patroclus. But when you have a myriad of men hacking away at each other, who's to notice, and stop to watch, when two heroes swear off against one another? It's not a bad movie at all. Rarely does one's mind drift. But why did the writers try to hammer that round peg of a romance into the square hole of the narrative itself? Is Brad Pitt such a bustier-melting hunk that someone thought the audience wanted to see his tender side? And his backside as well? Was he so expensive that somebody figured he ought to be given more lines of dialog? And get that stupid helmet off so we can all see how handsome he is? I was reassured to see that the guys I enjoyed and admired most in the original -- the morally upright Hector and the clever, ironic Odysseus -- receive fair treatment here. I never liked Paris much. I always thought of him as a handsome namby-pamby and an idiot to boot. Happily he doesn't get much better play in the movie.",6,9,19,2 July 2005
Orphan," Avoid If Possible.
","It begins with a horrifying and bloody nightmare from which Vera Farmiga awakes shaken. We don't know it's a nightmare until there is a cut to her sitting up, panting and sweaty. How's that for an imaginative scene?It ends with one of those excruciating scenes in which a slasher -- in this case the adopted and demonic daughter of Farmiga and husband Pete Sarsgaard chases everyone around the darkened house with a bloody knife, murdering her way through the gloom. Every movement of the knife seems to be accompanied by the snick of sharp metal against metal -- even when the knife is only being waved through the air. Even when it's brandished UNDER WATER.Good-bye Sarsgaard, overcome by a pubescent young girl. And it's almost good-bye for Farmiga and her younger daughter as they are chased through the snowy woods by the knife-wielding juvenile maniac.The adopted kid is one of those slashers who are very difficult to kill, a veritable Rasputin. You can stomp her, you can kick her face in, you can shoot her. She falls down, apparently lifeless, but just as the sweet music begins to play, she comes back to life more animated, more thoroughly evil, than before. You can pull her underwater too. Doesn't matter. Nothing matters.In her last scene, the adopted demon drowns the way it has become fashionable to drown -- the way Robin Williams drowns in 'Insomnia,' and George Clooney in 'The Perfect Storm', and Leonard DeCaprio in 'Titanic.' Each drifts slowly down into the murk, looking upward, sometimes smiling. There is no longer any other way to die underwater. A struggle would be unseemly.You want a laugh? Johnson and Mace, the 'writers', whose names I believe are actually the nom de plume of some deranged computer, have Farmiga in a hospital bed. She receives a call on her cell phone, informing her that the adopted nine-year-old daughter is really a thirty-three year old homicidal maniac and that her husband and child are in immediate danger. What would you, the viewer, do? You'd rush to the nurse's station, have the caller repeat the information, and dial the police pronto. Not this heroine. As always happens in these movies, she tells no one, stumbles out to her car, and speeds over the snow, ice-slick roads to her distant home -- alone.This is derivative garbage, mostly from 'The Omen' but borrowing from any source that promises the additional thrill that will suck another unwary customer into the theater. It's only ambition is to deliver money-making thrills. If you're into arousal jags, this one should do the job.The pity is that both Vera Farmiga and Peter Sarsgaard are fine actors of considerable talent and range. Farmiga, in particular, has the kind of quirky face and sexy figure that seems made for the camera. Her features are plastic, as if some sculptor had begin molding a beautiful visage and then was called away before he was quite finished. And Sarsgaard can play good or bad. He has the kind of bland cleanliness that can go either way. But seeing him lying on his back on the floor, with that maniacal kid sitting on his chest, stabbing him repeatedly while he watches curiously -- well, it was all too much.How can anyone attach his or her name to an abomination like this?",2,9,21,26 December 2011
The Hustler," Shoot Pool, Fast Eddie.
","When Paul Newman got his teeth into a role he could really deliver. Nobody else could have handled roles like the leads in 'Cool Hand Luke,' 'Hud,' 'The Verdict,' or this, his first major effort, 'The Hustler.' Not to say that Newman's performance makes the movie because ALL of the major performances are superb, as is the direction by Robert Rossen, the script by Rossen and Sidney Caroll, and the jazzy blues score by Kenyon Hopkins. Even the set dressing couldn't be much improved. This one is a winner.Newman is 'Fast Eddie' Felson from Oakland, California, who comes to New York to play the reigning king of the game of pool, 'Minnesota Fats', done to a turn by Jackie Gleason in a dramatic part. The initial contest drags on for twenty-five hours. Newman, a small-time hustler, is as talented as Gleason but he drinks recklessly and becomes over confident, fatigued, and careless. He loses everything he'd won when the game began.Cutting a long story short, Newman ditches his sensible old partner, Myron McCormick, meets a lame alcoholic, Piper Laurie, and moves in with her. Laurie falls very convincingly in love with Newman but his attitude towards her is casual, sometimes callous. Failing at local hustling and getting his thumbs broken in the process, Newman comes under the tutelage of gambler George C. Scott. Scott had made a good deal of money off Newman's losing the bout with Gleason, which Scott attributes to a lack of character. There is an immediate antipathy between Laurie and Scott. She sees Scott as a materialist with no soul, and he sees her as structurally weak, which she is. Scott wins the contest but Newman acquires 'character' in addition to talent, and in the final match up, he beats Gleason flat, then leaves town alone.It's a tragic story. Newman may 'win' in the end but Laurie loses everything in order to make that victory possible. Newman's character arc is clear. He begins as a cold-blooded hustler, using everyone to advance his standing in the game's hierarchy. He dumps his old friend and partner, McCormick, and chooses to play a game of billiards with the effete Murray Hamilton over leaving with Piper Laurie. By the end of the film he is almost destroyed and willingly gives up big-time pool, which is not a bad idea since his achievement, in beating Gleason, was stunning. What could he do for an encore? I kept waiting for some trap door to open and have the whole enterprise collapse but it never happened. (The deck sagged only once, during the final shoot out between Newman and Gleason, when Newman spells everything out for an audience that, in its infinite maturity, must already understand.)It's hard to believe that Piper Laurie once played third fiddle to Francis the Talking Mule or Elvis Presley the Singing King. She's not the cloyingly sweet cutie from the early 1950s. She's worn -- just enough. She doesn't play the character of the drunken slut flatly either. She brings nuance to the part. Her voice is a mellow contralto and has peculiar and unpredictable ups and down, and often she turns her face from the person she's speaking to and looks at him from the sides of her eyes. It doesn't come across as an acting trick. It seems more like the kind of habit we might find in someone we know. When she tells Newman in an firm declarative statement that she loves him, and Newman looks away embarrassed, we find that scene familiar too.Murray Hamilton's ultra-wealthy gentleman gambler is likewise outstanding. The photography has given us some angles of Scott that lend him a Satanic cast. Hamilton gives Scott some curious regard then turns to look at a statuette of a satyr, or perhaps its Bacchus or Pan, and remarks that Scott could have modeled for the sculptor. (Scott stares at it for a few seconds then says, 'It's possible.') And when Hamilton loses a bundle of money to Newman and Scott during a game of billiards, he gives new meaning to the descriptive adjective 'shaken.' But there isn't space enough to give this movie the attention it deserves. It was, in its time, a breakthrough film for Newman, Scott, and Gleason, and it led inevitably to one or two pallid imitations like 'The Cincinnati Kid.' Fats and Fast Eddie became icons of vernacular culture, enduring enough that Eddie was resurrected by Martin Scorcese for 'The Color of Money.' Scott repeatedly refers to Newman as a 'loser' while Piper Laurie tells Newman he's a 'winner.' Well, in the end, Newman is a tragic winner. The film itself is a winner.",9,4,6,11 July 2009
Insomnia," Thus conscience does make insomniacs of us all...
","SPOILERS. You have to hand it to Al Pacino's detective in this movie. He goes for more than six days and nights without sleeping. (Dormer -- what an ironic name for an insomniac.) He even loads up on Alaskan beer and becomes so woozy he can't find the men's room and he *still* can't sleep. He drags himself from room to room. On one occasion when he runs there is no spring left in his step, only heavy weight. There were times I felt, 'I AM that man!' Well, he feels pretty crummy because (1) he planted some evidence down in LA to ensure the conviction of some genuinely guilty scumbag, and (2) he accidentally (maybe) shot and killed his partner who was about to turn on him for Internal Affairs. He's so beat that he simply doesn't remember whether he did it deliberately or not. This isn't the tragic, distant young Don of The Godfather. Nor does he rant, flail his arms, and roll his eyes as he did in some later roles.Hillary Swank is in some ways just as interesting and in some ways less so. She doesn't have as much a part as Pacino. And she sounds lispy, like a model who has taken acting lessons, although this impression is in error because she was pretty good in 'Boys Don't Cry.' The interesting aspect of her presence in this movie is that she looks far, far better as a beautiful young woman than she did as a tender young man. My God, those plump lips, those big incisors, those slightly feline eyes -- if she were an animal she'd be a small predator, maybe an ocelot. She can lisp anytime she wants.Robin Williams. A deadly serious role. I never realized before how much he looks in profile like an old crone. He gives a good performance, a perfectly pragmatic novelist who's only motive, post facto, is seeing that no one suffers because of guilt or conscience. He's so rational -- so REASONABLE -- in his arguments with Pacino, telling Pacino how pinning the accidental shooting AND the murder under investigation on an innocent, but not entirely saintly, third party is the right thing to do that, yes, it doesn't seem like the worst conspiracy in the world. The major flaw as far as Williams' character is concerned is not the fault of the actor but of the writers, who turn him into a conventionally violent all-guns-blazing maniac at the end. The novelist we've come to know and love would just not act like that, anymore than Hannibal Lecter would pick his nose at the dinner table.The story is almost as exhausting to watch as it must have been for Pacino's detective to experience, yet it's not at all dull. The location shooting includes British Columbia, familiar ground now, but has some spectacular shots of Alaska's mountains, rivers, and wet small-town streets. At those latitudes the sun may set but it's always daylight. This doesn't bother the natural fauna though. At 2 AM, sunlight or not, the birds are as much asleep as the people and it is as quiet as the dead of night should be. Unsettling territory. The director spices things up with brief inserts reflecting Pacino's hypnogogic hallucinations. They're kind of interesting in themselves. Were you ever about to fall asleep and suddenly seemed to see insects or some other repugnant things in front of you? They're fairly common experiences, yet no one can explain them. All we know is that they don't seem to come from the same part of the brain that generates dreams. There is no humor in the film, but there is action. Most notably a chase through the town's streets and alleys and through it's lumberyard. Nothing spectacular though. No jumping across rooftops or anything. Neither actor is Clint Eastwood. Instead they leap up onto hurricane fences and kind of tumble over on the other side. Pacino loses his footing at a critical moment.It's genuinely worth watching, although it's grim. It embodies a kind of philosophy in which good cop/ bad cop = the same cop. And it's morally stern. Pacino finally gets to sleep.",Null,1,1,14 May 2003
L.A. Confidential," Three Cops Who Changed Their Minds
","SPOILERS...The story of three cops who changed their minds. Guy Pearce begins as a coldly manipulative cop interested mainly in promotions. He winds up sanctioning the use of brute force in order to obtain what passes for justice in this movie. Kevin Spacey is sort of 'affiliated' with the LAPD but his chief interest is in being technical adviser on a 'Dragnet' show and getting his picture in the L.A. Times. He discovers that he has a sense of responsibility when a sympathetic young bisexual is murdered on his watch. Russell Crowe is an apparently mindless brutal thug who finds that love has made him vulnerable and that the instrumentality of anger has its limits.Overall, it's an excellent film. The theme is similar to that of 'Chinatown,' in which Jack Nicholson, a brittle but basically decent representative of objectivity and order, discovers corruption in high places. 'L. A. Confidential' isn't 'Chinatown' (what is?) but it brims with the same irony and sense of dis-ease, although our identification with a single isolated human being is dispersed over a trio of flawed cops.What a well-drawn flick. Curtis Hanson handles the direction competently, blessedly without the sort of dazzling special effects a viewer has come to expect from cop movies. There is plenty of action, but no car chases, exploding heads, or slow-motion deaths. In fact, all but two of the deaths take place offscreen. That's directorial bravery for you. Bring another Medal of Valor here.The performances are about as good as they come. Danny DeVito is a tabloid reporter who speaks in headlines, liable at any moment to say something like, 'What he needs is a snoot of coca-cola up the old schnozzola.' (This is 1953, don't forget.) Kim Basinger is beautiful as a Veronica Lake lookalike but doesn't have too much of a chance to stretch her acting chops. Guy Pearce as the independent loner is the only character who gets my respect from beginning to end. He really BELIEVES in the cause, a hard charger, unfriendly though he may be. He also looks oddly like Arnold Schwarzenegger, especially odd since he was a body builder of sorts. I knew another body builder who was Schwarzenegger's body double in 'Raw Deal' because he was a ringer. (Do all body builder have to look like Arnold Schwarzenegger? I mean, aside from their glutes?) Speaking of body builders, Russell Crowe gets a lot of screen time in a dark brown suit speckled with what looks like bird droppings, perhaps the ugliest suit ever committed to film, with shoulders as wide as the central span of the George Washington Bridge.Two of the performances are irreproachable. John Cromwell is the corrupt police captain. He plays the role chewing gum and exuding unpretentious Irish charm ('Call me Dudley.') while tempering the charm with what sounds like good-natured and sincere common sense advice. Underneath that, he's thoroughly rotten in every respect. And Kevin Spacey is perfect as the vain detective who knows his way around the show-biz part of L.A. and enjoys schmoozing with councilmen, celebrities, and the press. He's involved in the two most amusing scenes in the movie. The first involves an almost miraculous control of facial expression. He's called in for interrogation by his superiors and is asked to testify against some other officers. 'No,' he says, 'I won't snitch on anyone in the department.' They offer him no punishment more severe than a slap on the wrist and before he knows it, he'll be back on 'the show,' which he loves. 'The show?' he asks. There is a long long moment while his face sort of drifts from surprise, through disbelief, and into resignation. Then he figuratively shrugs his shoulders and says, without any deliberation, 'All right, I'll do it.' The very model of a complete sellout. The other amusing scene is when he and Pearce accost a beautiful blond in a nightclub and sneer at her because she's a whore plastic-surgerized to look like Lana Turner. And Spacey informs Pearce to lay off, 'She IS Lana Turner.' When they return to their car, both officers begin laughing.The photography is fine, the early 50s decor is what you'd expect from a professional job like this. There isn't much in the way of original music in the score -- hardly any in fact -- but period music is used, not overused, to good effect. (It's quality varies from Kay Starr to Cole Porter.) Extra Casting and Wardrobe even went to the trouble of making the actors playing Jerry Mulligan and Chet Baker LOOK LIKE Mulligan and Baker, although they cut Baker's recorded solo short on 'The Lady is a Tramp.'The movie doesn't have a traditionally happy ending really. All values are gray, as they are in real life, rather than black and white. Pearce, the political animal, remains ambitious but now has distance enough from his role to see it for what it is. The same seems to be true for Crowe's character, who has found the love of a good woman. Well, the love of a woman anyway. Crowe still has a long way to go before reaching redemption. He's killed in cold blood a rapist and drug dealer and planted a gun on him and gotten away with it, but we've seen him look disgusted at some violence he's forced to witness later in the film. Vincennes is dead.This one is definitely worth seeing.Catch this, if you can.",Null,10,15,20 December 2003
Concussion," Have You Thought About Squash Instead?
","When I was a child the favorite American sport was baseball. Interest in football was limited to college teams because there were no professional teams. Over the years football seems to have eclipsed baseball as the national sport. And the reason is easy to understand. Baseball has a lot of slack time. The pitcher has to survey the field, the batter has to get in position, sometimes he lets the ball sail by, and there's very little physical contact.Compared to football it's dull. Football has a cabal of behemoths bashing one another. The only pause in the action occurs when the teams run together for a huddle. Now we have basketball, which is all action all the time. Movies have pretty much followed the same trajectory. If a good film like 'Bullett' had a thrilling high-speed pursuit, similar films now begin and end with a car chase. And they usually end with exploding fireballs. The snub-nosed .38 has been replaced by an ugly black cannon that fires bullets the size of footballs and has the added advantage of never having to be aimed or reloaded.Okay, okay. I'm stepping down off this egg crate. Someone give me a hand, please? Thank you.I wanted this to be really good and, in fact, the performances aren't at all bad, especially Will Smith in a dramatic role, and an almost unrecognizable Albert Brooks. The doc who represents the NFL is memorable too. And most impressive are Eddy Marsan as the unapproachable expert in the field of brain damage, and Peter Berg, who looks like you look when you get out of bed after a night on the town.Berg is the first cadaver who shows up on pathologist Smith's table. Smith has never heard of football so he knows nothing about it. Yet here's a football hero who played for almost 20 years for the Pittsburgh Steelers and has been acting crazy for a year before snuffing himself. His brain looks normal, except when it's 'fixed' an sliced up into paper-thin pieces for microscopic examination. Smith finds something unusual. What it is, isn't clearly explained. ('Bad proteins.') But he concludes it's the result of getting your head banged around on the gridiron for twenty years and he calls it 'concussive traumatic encephalopathy.' I don't believe the symptoms f the victims shown on screen. There's not just dementia but every single victim turns extremely violent. Makes for a tumultuous scene each time but it's probably fabricated. Against the advice of many of his colleagues, afraid to alienate the all-powerful National Football League, he published his findings on two similar cadavers, both football players. I envied him when he opened his copy of the (unnamed) medical journal and glowed with pride when he saw his name at the top of the list of coauthors. I remember the warm glow I felt when I first saw my name as a coauthor in a scientific journal. There were only two other names, Frances Cheek and Richard Weisman. Medical journals tend to have far more coauthors. Smith's original article, for which he was largely responsible, had about half a dozen. Some have had as many as sixty-five, which to me sounds like overreach.Well, that's a bit off track, I know. But the story itself is familiar to anyone who has watched the biopics that came out of Warners and MGM during the 30s and 40s. Of course this has a much larger budget and is in color on a wide screen, yet the armature is there. An unexpected discovery by a scientist. It's controversial. There are supportive but skeptical friends. There's an identifiable enemy, who caves at the end. At the climax, the now-gray-haired but thoroughly redeemed hero gives a conciliatory and inspiring speech to a quietly eager audience of scientific aristos. You can check the framework out in something like Edward G. Robinson's 'Dr. Ehrlich's Magic Bullet' or Paul Muni's 'The Story of Louis Pasteur.' 'Concussion' may be as well done, although despite the uplifting ending nothing in football seems to have changed. Makeup has done a good job on Smith an on Albert Brooks. Not on Alex Baldwin, who looks wrecked.",5,1,2,8 November 2016
The Day After Tomorrow," Wretched excess.
","In movies like 'Twister' you only get one real disaster, although admittedly it's a doozie. In movies like 'Earthquake' you can get several disasters for the price of one -- the ground shakes, dams burst and cause floods, there may be a fire. In movies like 'The Day After Tomorrow' you get no end of disasters, and you flirt with the end of the world too.Let me see. Floods. Tsunamis. Cold snaps beyond belief. Tornadoes. (No fires.) A sick child threatened with abandonment. A sick adult who needs medicine that can only be found in a super dangerous place. A gigantic crevasse in the ice into which men and machines fall. (This will have to do in lieu of an earthquake.) Hurricanes. Blizzards. Airplane crashes. The doomed team having a final drink of twelve-year old scotch. A middle-aged man hiking in snowshoes from Washington to New York hauling a sled, in order to be with his trapped son because 'I promised him.' Other things of similar ilk.I didn't mind so much seeing LA get it. Nothing against the Capitol Records Building (which takes off in a tornado like a stack of frisbees). It's just knowing that the storm is taking along with it several dozen Taj Mahal Motels painted day-glo purple. And the 'Hollywood' sign, which, to borrow a phrase, looks like 'an explosion in a shingle factory.' On the other hand it was tragic to see New York first inundated by seawater and then frozen solid. The notion of patrons in The White Horse Tavern frozen stiff while still hunched over their chessboards brought tears to my eyes. And the frosty statues in Julius's, immobilized during a sip of a martini, pinkies still pointed upward.Actually, the special effects are very good. The flood in New York is naturally much better than George Pal's justly celebrated earlier version. And there's something appealing about scenes in which people creep about on deserted ships.That, by the way, reminds me of the one big surprise in the movie. Hundreds of people are trapped by the flood on the upper stories of the New York Public Library, shouting at one another, and suddenly everyone goes quiet. A very low rumble is heard from the avenue outside. People rush to the windows and what we see is shocking -- the prow of a huge Russian tanker proceeding uptown with slow majesty.I guess, from reading the 'trivia' entries, that the director was serious in his concern about global warming -- as he should be. The movie doesn't really convey that anxiety. I know a little about climatology but the explanation got passed me. (Maybe the book made more sense.) As it is, the science we hear is very sketchy and given by fiat. (Why does atmospheric subsidence over the Canadian north bring with it storm and snow instead of stability and low temperatures?) Because Dennis Quaid's model says it does? Anyway, I was lost.The last ice ages left us with our immediate hominid ancestors ('Cro-Magnon'), woolly mammoths, and who knows what else? This one seems to leave us in thrall to tropical third-world countries, which should make for an interesting sequel.I enjoyed the movie's visuals. (It's impossible to comment on the acting.) What's worrisome is that global warming -- despite a multitude of attempt to muddy the scientific waters -- is now pretty much universally accepted by investigators without vested interests. 'The Day After Tomorrow' turns it into an excuse for just another expensive disaster flick.It's worth watching though. That Russian ship groaning past the Public Library is a gem.",5,3,6,14 May 2005
Match Point," Too Long In The Mid-day Sun.
","Poor young tennis instructor falls for his client's girl friend, and who wouldn't? It's smoldering Scarlett Johansson from Boulder, Colorado, whose beauty is of such peculiarity that from some angles she looks like a creature recently emerged from the sea.The attraction between Johansson and her swain, Mathew Goode, is understandable. Not only does Johansson look good but, as she remarks, 'Nobody ever asked for their money back.' However, her boyfriend, Goode, is a high-end British aristo, soon to be Lord of Cummerbund-and-Peplum or whatever it is. The family is ill disposed towards an aspiring American actress with only one commercial behind her and a distinct lack of interest from any casting directors. I mean, what is she going to do when her looks fade -- make him flapjacks for breakfast and prairie oysters for supper? Not that it matters much, because Johansson and Goode are soon quit of each other. The young tennis coach who had fallen for her and had a roll in the meadow with her now seeks her out again, although he himself is married to the high-end sister of his tennis client.Are you following all this? I followed it but I had to organize as much concentration as I did when learning to solve quadratic equations. 'Hannah and Her Sisters' was another pretzel of intrigue and crossed relationships, and so was 'A Midsummer Night's Sex Comedy.' The story plays out as if it had been intended for New York City and wound up in Mayfair. It's still distinctly Woody Allen, with overlapping dialog, very little shouting -- and I don't know how many times one person says to another, 'How ARE you?' The score is distinctive. Scratchy-sounding arias. The production design is carefully done, lavish, and exquisitely photographed. London has not looked this CLEAN since Robert Mitchum strode through it in his Savile Row suits in the remake of 'The Big Sleep.' As a writer, Allen sometimes can't help himself from insinuating jokes into dramatic situations but he manages to avoid it here. The problem is that it DOES drag on for a long time. It isn't funny and it's not gripping. In 'Manhattan,' I didn't care who wound up with whom but enjoyed the little gags, like Allan in a boat in Central Park trailing his hand through the water and coming up with a twisted clump of slime. No such jokes here.I don't consider it one of Allen's better films. Others apparently don't agree.",5,0,2,21 October 2013
A Bridge Too Far," Accurate, flawed
","I applaud Attenborough for having made this movie. What a headache its filming must have been. It's accurate in a sense both material and overall.His P 47s may be mock ups, but he used genuine World-War-II era M-4 'Sherman' tanks. (God knows how he managed to muster them.) I can't vouch for the German tank -- there is only one shown on screen and it could pass for a Panther. I also admire him for having the daring to make a movie about an unmitigated Allied defeat. As a whole, movies in this genre depict a victory on the part of the nations producing the movie in the first place.'The Enemy Below,' 'Zulu,' 'Torpedo Bay,' 'Die Brucke,' just to give American, British, Italian, and German examples. The list goes on. About the only time we're permitted to witness defeats for 'our side' is during a heroic last stand against overwhelming odds ('Bataan') or when the defeat is the result of dirty pool ('Pearl Harbor'). But here, with no excuses, Attenborough delivers a different message entirely.The performances are as good as can be expected from actors who have so little time to develop their characters. The battle scenes are realistic enough, without their shoving our noses into spilled intestines. Attenborough is not a splashy director but he has a couple of things go on that are worth noticing. The Dutch citizens who first greet the Allied troops joyfully as liberators wind up being slaughtered and their cities destroyed by the war that is thrust on them. Civilian suffering tends to get short shrift unless one of them is Sofia Loren or somebody. Another worthwhile touch, a small one. The British politely take over one of those large super-scrubbed middle-class Dutch homes as a hospital -- 'just for the slightly wounded, Ma'am.' And as the first soldiers enter they step over two kids playing with a toy train on a thick creamy rug -- and a few drops of blood sprinkle the carpet. Two other observations. 'The Longest Day' is sometimes compared unfavorably to this film for a number of reasons, many of them justified. But 'The Longest Day' was made under restrictions that had been lifted by the time this movie was produced. Zanuck wanted to show more of the slaughter at Omaha Beach but was prevented from doing so. He was similarly prevented by prevailing folkways from showing Allied troops as more brutal. And he originally filmed the closing scene of the movie not with a triumphant parade of victorious infantrymen marching up the slopes to a peppy military tune but with an forlorn, exhausted, empty grunt, sitting at the water's edge and listlessly tossing pebbles into the waves. The scene had to be deleted. A bothersome thing about 'A Bridge Too Far' is that, at least as I've seen it on TV, I can't easily tell who is where. In Ryan's book it's easy enough to follow events and characters but, as edited, this movie is pretty confusing. When five of the major actors all show up together on a balcony, it came as a big surprise. I thought Connery and one or two of the others were still trapped behind German lines! I don't know whether this confusion is due to poor editing or a ministroke.",Null,19,23,28 November 2001
Zodiac," Unfinished Narrative.
","The movie industry must be drawn to this story of the San Francisco Bay Area serial murderer like moths to a Klieg light and they always wind up irritated. The Zodiac narrative doesn't fit the required dramatic trajectory. Oh, the elements that have now become conventions are all there in the investigation -- the spooky killings, piecing the tesserae together into a mosaic with a pattern, the problem coordinating efforts between venues, the increasing number of incidents, the involvement of the press, the frustration of the police, the special investigative team, the obsessive pursuer, the red herrings, the 'good' suspects who can't be pinned down -- but there is no climax! What is SUPPOSED to happen is that the killer is identified and finally captured, preferably after a chase, and preferably after a shoot out if possible, then brought to justice. The last shot of the movie ought to show either (1) the vicious murderer smiling behind bars or (2) the lead detective finally able to sleep peacefully, undisturbed by nightmares.Not here. Multiple characters weave their way in and out of the story, so many that some of us may lose track of who's who. Mainly we can identify Robert Graysmith (Jake Gyllenhaal), his wife (Chloe Sevigny), reporter Paul Avery (Robert Downey, Jr.). and Inspector Toschi (Mark Ruffalo). We can identify them because they are familiar faces and because they show up on screen more often than others. And Jake Gyllenhaal is the especially perceptive cartoonist who is gradually swept up in the case, becomes possessed by it, and loses his family and his job in order to write the definitive book about it. I guess we remember Melvin Belli (Bryan Cox) too because he's so fluid. And we remember Arthur Leigh Allen (John Carroll Lynch) because he looks monumentally guilty.The story is all Gylenhaal's. He's the guy who cracks the code, does the leg work, amazes the police with his dedication, and virtually solves the case, though not to the satisfaction of the justice system. His chase, though ultimately fruitless, becomes frenzied. Well, it has to be the story of Graysmith and his sacrifices. He wrote the book the film is based on and he was technical adviser, along with his wife. If I were to be the adviser on a movie about MY life, my ex-wife would have had to leave because of my dedication to justice too, not because I kept a closet full of ladies' shoes or something. (No.) But then, why did the investigation become so fast and sweaty towards the end? The cops had long ago given up the case. Nothing was pending. There were no deadlines looming. The viewer senses chiefly that the pace must pick up speed because that's what the traditional narrative structure demands. The audience expects it. And, further, Graysmith must have found himself with a fascinating and commercial story that had no satisfactory ending, which is why Truman Capote was being driven nuts in the case of 'In Cold Blood,' and delayed finishing the book until the killers were hanged.It isn't that there are no recurring treatments of unsolved murders. 'Lizzie Borden took an ax,' etc. The Black Dahlia. And then there's Jack the Ripper. But the killers in these cases are safely dead, along with all the other real characters, and you can speculate about them as much as you like without fear of their taking legal redress. But with the Zodiac killer, who began his career in 1969 and, as far as we know, is still around, along with the victims and the agents of social control, conjecture has to be kept within the bounds of prudence. The result: an unfinished narrative, with everything left hanging in the air.It would have been nice if they'd caught the murderous, crowing lunatic. Not only would it have made a better book and better film, but he needs to suffer a little. As it stands, this movie provides us with all the details of the case we're likely to know. It's intelligently done. No exploding heads, no glitzy directorial displays, no lightning-fast editing. We're not likely to see a better description of the case on film.Yet the film leaves a sour taste. If the hero of the tale is Robert Graysmith (nee Robert Gray Smith), he's a flawed hero in real life and even in this screen portrayal. Or maybe it's just me. I'm chary of over achievers, especially reporters accused of plagiarism and suspected of forging one of Zodiac's letters, shopping his book around, looking so avidly for money and celebrity.",5,5,10,23 August 2008
Milk," 'You can't violate God's law.'
","Not a bad biography of Harvey Milk (Sean Penn), the gay San Francisco City Supervisor who, along with Mayor Moscone, was assassinated by political opponent Dan White (Josh Brolin) in 1978.Penn has got Milk's speech and mannerisms down pat. (The HOURS he must have put into research.) On display are Milk's insouciant charm and his political savvy, accessorized by some touches of egotism. There is nothing flamboyantly 'homosexual' about Milk's mannerisms. That was probably part of his winning ways outside the Castro. Not that it would have kept him from running for office if he'd been a flaming queer. I lived in the Bay Area at the time and remember one of the candidates for a minor office -- 'Sister Boom Boom', a male who dressed in a vulgar parody of a nun's outfit with short skirt, high heels, fishnet stockings, and lurid make up. It wouldn't have kept Milk from running but it would have kept him from winning.There shouldn't be anything surprising about Milk's having become the first openly gay man to hold a major elective office. California has a way of tolerating all sorts in its politics. It can elect a Viennese weight lifter as governor, or propel an aging ex-actor into the presidency.The story if naturally from Harvey Milk's point of view. His ghost narrates the events of his career into a tape recorder. He inevitably emerges as the heroic protagonist he was. (Who knows which of all those death threats is real?) And he undoubtedly stood for office in order to promote something greater than himself.Nor does the movie avoid mention of any of his human flaws. He begins his first campaign as a rather typical liberal -- more help for seniors, aid for schools and minorities, and so forth. But his political persona devolves into something narrower, defined as he sees it through the prism of his sexual orientation. Then, too, he wants to 'out' every homosexual in America, whether they want it or not. (A subordinate points out to Milk that this might be disturbing to the outed persons' families and careers, but he shrugs it off.) When the sublime Anita Bryant -- the orange-juice saleslady who is convinced that Jesus loves everybody but queers -- pulls off a win for 'family values' in Florida, Milk doesn't hesitate to get his supporters together and shout that they should 'show your anger.' Being permitted to show your anger is one of several advantages to victimhood. You get to have an enemy and heap your calumny upon him. Especially when your enemy is Anita ('Family Values') Bryant or a nerd like State Senator Briggs, who can't tell 'homosexuality' from 'pedophilia.' As a victim, you also get to participate in what the sociologost Arnold van Gennep called 'rites of intensification.' The gays have theirs, including Halloween in San Francisco, and we have ours -- the Fourth of July parades, the Christmas carols, Cinco de Mayo, Yom Kippur. Hitler's Nurenberg rallies were among the most imposing of rites of intensification.But in a way the villain here is not so much Dan White, although he was its instrument. It's intolerant categorical thinking, the belief in a Manichaean world that is black OR white, good OR evil, with no room for anything in between or any mixture in any proportion of both. Dan White's declaration is emblematic: 'I grew up differently. Everything was either moral or immoral.' In categorical thinking, all sorts of weird things are lumped together simply because they're seen as either 'moral' or 'immoral.' A little something is just as bad as a lot of something. That's why Senator Briggs can't separate homosexuality from pedophilia. Anita Bryant argues with a bright smile that gay rights today will lead to rights for thieves and murderers tomorrow. And Milk writes that if we can fire gays today, we should look at what happened next to the fired gays in 1930s Germany.I kind of missed a more thorough explanation of Dan White's behavior though, especially since Josh Brolin did such a crackerjack job of projecting White's distress. In a way, White the murderer was a more complicated and interesting man than Milk the victim. He really meant it when he said something was either moral or immoral. He blew his brains out two years after his release from prison. And he experienced a volcano of torment trying to support his traditional family on the measly salary of a City Supervisor. During his temporary resignation he operated some kind of fast food joint which failed to do business.You can't expect much about Dan White in a movie entitled 'Milk,' of course, but in some ways 'Milk and White' might have made for a more gripping story.",7,2,4,29 October 2009
The Prestige," Never ask me about my business.
","Dark, brooding piece about the rivalry between two turn-of-the century stage illusionists outdoing each other. One of the young men, Borden (Christian Bale) may have been responsible for the death of the other's beloved blond wife, the other being Angier (Hugh Jackman). Angier and his mentor, Michael Caine, continue their careers, while Borden builds his own.The emotional tumult caused by the death of Angier's wife leads him to sabotage Borden's performance, actually shooting two of his fingers off. Borden, filled with resentment, retaliates by putting a major crimp into Angier's career. It gets a little complicated but they both wind up more or less at the top of the prestidigitative heap before the end.There are romances flung into the pot too, functional to the extent that they illustrate character development in the two magicians and act as links between the two competitors. Scarlette Johansson is surprisingly good as the bosomy stage assistant with the working-class Brit accent, even though the dialect suppresses her usual croak. Rebecca Hall is splendid as the perceptive woman who takes up with the lower-class Borden, even though she knows he's lying half the time when he tells her he loves her. (He's married to his job, you see.) Enter Nicolas Tesla, the very real historical figure who did all sorts of things, conceptual and physical, that strike some of us as a little outré today. A man ahead of his time, played by an unrecognizable David Bowie.At this point, what was a more or less cogent drama turns into something else. Tesla, like Baron Frankenstein, pulls off something that's half scientific and half supernatural. If you've seen 'The Fly' you have some idea, only the idea you have is a little simpler than the one presented here. I was a little confused by the ending in which 'all is explained' but somewhat too perfunctorily for me. Maybe I'm dull but the jigsaw puzzle remained mostly a table full of scattered and disjointed pieces.The photography captures the time and place nicely. Too nicely, maybe, because it's hard to imagine anyone wanting to live in a landscape of perpetual poverty and gloom. If there was a scene in bright daylight, I missed it. Do we learn anything about the tricks of stage magicians? Are you kidding? Illusionists have the kinds of social borders (us inside, them outside) that cops have, or airline pilots or doctors. The trick is told when the trick is sold. We do see some of the machinations but they're ones we might have easily figured out for ourselves. The ultimate trick, the one devised by Tesla, is of course never explained because it never happened.I hope you don't find these comments confusing. If you do, the film will present an even greater challenge. Still, it's worth watching for anyone with mature sensibilities. Confusing, maybe. Pandering, no.",7,3,8,7 August 2007
The Terminator," You'll find this humerus.....
","What's worse than an ordinary action picture? Hardly anything, except maybe a really bad slasher movie. In an action picture we see a fireball explode in slow motion while in the foreground an actor dives towards the camera. A speeding car hits an obstacle and does a grand jetee. Everyone's hand grips an ugly gun. The disparate hero and heroine finally fall for one another and close the deal between blood baths. The musical score pounds us into excruciating insensibility. A pinned hand gropes for a weapon. The script is sparsely sprinkled with wisecracks to the wise.'The Terminator' has all of these clichés and more, and yet, the gol danged thing hangs together. It's as if you'd taken all your leftovers, thrown them into a pot, shaken some lesser-used seasoning onto it, cooked it, and hoped for the best. It isn't that there's very much distinctive about the film, except maybe its all-gray pallet and the overall darkness. Of course it's easier to shoot in LA at night when the city is empty of all human tissue. If you want to make a movie about the last person on earth, shoot it in downtown LA on a weekend. Come to think of it, they already have -- 'The Omega Man.' It's not possible to explain the success of this flick. The only thing you can say is that it succeeds on its own terms. It has no moral, like 'The Invasion of the Body Snatchers,' no resonance beyond its violence. If the acting is good enough that's largely because so little is called for. The best performance is given by the two cops. Arnold comes in a close second. His best moments come when he is not on screen but has been replaced by a completely metallic skeletal cyborg that is blown to bits -- an ear here, a humerus there -- until he is finally extinguished by this gigantic duck press. That's not to put down Linda Hamilton. She is plump lipped, hair blown, and sexy. She was my supporting player in another film, one that I think everyone would agree is a masterpiece of cinematic high art, a nonpareil of poetics, and an unforgettable action drama in itself -- 'King Kong Lives.' Michael Biene falls a bit short of the bar set by Linda Hamilton.But what does any of that matter? You can watch the thing repeatedly. It's almost hypnotic.",6,2,24,6 April 2006
Sleepy Hollow," Voloptuous and spooky.
","To tell the truth, I was a little confused by the plot. Yes, it's true. The story that used to be on every high school reading list lost me here and there. I can't remember the original, but did it really include so much detail about family trees and inheritances and local conspiracies to hide forbidden truths? It's hard to believe that it did.It probably doesn't matter that the story is confusing at times because the cinematography and set design are are so resplendently dismal as to be spooky in themselves. And if the constant twilight, the desaturated colors, the late Fall atmosphere, the general gloom of both the interiors and exteriors don't creep you out, there's always the Headless Hessian Horseman with his flailing blades. (He twirls them around in his hands like a gunfighter's six-shooters and they have this swishing sound.) The acting is pretty good too. Johnny Depp seems a little stiff at time but maybe the part calls for it. Christina Ricci looks almost edible with her wide forehead, enormous doll-like eyes, and diminutive splanchnocranium. The supporting players are all just fine, including Christopher Lee, with the exception of the kid who serves as Crane's sidekick. He sounds as if he's still practicing his lines.The story has a couple of false starts. Depp is first set up as a kind of visionary Sherlock Holmes type. He has invented new tools for investigating crime scenes. But none of them is explained and he is seen using them only once, for a purpose we can't define. We expect him, based on this early exposition, which leads to his exile from New York City to Sleepy Hollow, to be a scientific genius. But that's soon gotten out of the way. It isn't long before he meets the Horseman himself and realizes he's dealing with the supernatural.At that point, alas, the movie begins to lean more heavily on the clichÃ©s of the slasher movie. People do stupid things that put them in danger, for instance. Having just run away from the Horseman and knowing they are still being stalked by him, two guys stop running, turn around, and stare into the fog to see if their pursuer will show up. (Huh?) The constituents of the slasher movie are always there, lurking in the mist, ready to attack at any moment, like the Headless Horseman (and I DO mean 'headless'). The very first murder, in the opening few minutes, has a guy in a cornfield get his head lopped off and we see the blood splatter across the face of a Jack o' Lantern. Almost all the heads are chopped off graphically on the screen although there isn't that much blood, thanks. I suppose that kids, who ought to enjoy this movie, were part of the intended audience so the gore was contained.As for the Horseman himself -- well, I don't think I like him too much. He's presented as an immortal action figure. He's always in motion, galloping a horse at full speed, striding quickly around. He's dressed in a black cloak over black armor, which is alright, but I think he might have been spookier if he'd been less energetic and more of a plodding, implacable menace. The staging of his attacks are low-brow. There are sword fights out of any number of action movies, with two antagonists, flashing blades, twirling figures, swishing and clanking sounds -- all to no purpose since it's already known that the Horseman can't be beaten. At least they didn't throw in any flying kicks from the Chop Sockey movies.But the figure himself is really terrifying, especially when we don't have a clear view of him. The parts I enjoyed most were simply those in which frightened people were whispering in the shadows. The look and the feel of the late 18th-century Hudson Valley are admirably conveyed, though even that is a little too heavily laid on. Can't remember a single scene that takes place in broad daylight. It's as if the sun didn't exist in Sleepy Hollow.",6,1,2,29 December 2006
Hotel Rwanda," Ambitious, successful TV-docudrama.
","The story is familiar enough in its outline that I'll pretty much skip it. Basically, Don Cheadle's character, a hotel manager in Rwanda during the genocide, manages to save most of his family and more than a thousand Hutus who would otherwise have become victims in the slaughter.It's sometimes reminiscent of parts of 'The Killing Fields' and 'Salvador,' but it's more modestly done. No grand, sweeping shots of ten thousand extras; no repetitive shots of machetes hacking up innocent people. It's the story of one ordinary -- well, maybe extraordinary -- guy who wheedles, bribes, and blackmails until he gets his charges out into neighboring Tanzania.Yet, though we see little of it, the horror hangs palpably in the atmosphere. Cheadle's character is driving a van full of supplies back to his hotel in the middle of the night and the van begins to bump and lurch on a suddenly rough road. Cheadle gets out and discovers he's been driving over piles of corpses which cover the road as far ahead as he can see.The UN forces are present but almost (not quite) impotent. I lost track of who was doing all the killing -- there is the army, the rebels, various factions -- it hardly matters. The Hutus are killing the Tutsi children so as to wipe out the next generation. It's difficult to tell how this differs much from the Serbs raping rival women in order to impregnate them and produce a next generation that is at least half-Serbian.Perhaps half a million people were killed in Rwanda in 1994. The rivers and waterfalls were choked with naked and mutilated bodies. And little attention was paid by most of us, just as there is little attention being paid to events in Darfur as I write this. Our general view of human nature is that we are flawed but perfectible. Maybe we're just flawed. Maybe what we need is a signal of surrender, the kind dogs have, in which the loser rolls over on his back and the victor straddles him, looks around, and growls. Alas we have no such signal. The hand of the Intelligent Designer shook.Cheadle's performance is better than just good. He's VERY good. He darts about wearing the same expression, wheeling and dealing, being reasonable, until we think that's all there is to him. Until there is a scene with a corrupt general who swigs out of a bottle of single malt scotch and muses about his visit to Scotland. 'Good golf. I wonder if I will ever visit there again. Do you think so?' Cheadle, meanwhile, sweat pouring down his face, has been frantically stacking bottles of scotch in a crate to bribe the general, paying no attention, and he replies unthinkingly, 'No,' then looks up and adds quickly, 'I mean there are many things I believe we should all do in the future.' The scene ends with Cheadle's man who embraces realpolitik finally losing his temper and shouting wide-eyed at the general that some day there will be an accounting for all this and who, if not Cheadle, will be around to testify for the general. The transformation of the character from polite and subservient to angry and threatening is shocking. And it is hard to believe that Cheadle could have been one of the undercover Narcs in 'Traffic.' He's exceptional.His wife, Sophie Okonedo, is compellingly beautiful in a most ordinary kind of way with her plump pouting lips, her Egyptian eyes, and her narrow-shouldered vulnerable frame.But, really, all the performances are pretty good. If there were a temptation to turn the white folks into villains, it was successfully resisted. I'm not sure -- I'll have to look it up later -- but I don't believe the distinction between Tutsi and Hutu was created by European colonials. Probably the measurements and all that took place, and perhaps the laying on of hands ceremony, but if I remember the Hutu and Tutsi spoke different languages and were of different somatotypes to begin with. Not that it matters much.The movie is both gripping and instructive. A great candidate for showing in classes on international affairs and social change. Throw it into a philosophy class while you're at it. Let's see what they make out of human nature.",7,0,0,25 February 2006
Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy," Sometimes You Need A Scorecard.
","I'm giving this production some bonus points for the elegant photography, composition, acting, and the use of sound. Oh, and for being a movie that should be X rated because in all these respects it's a movie made for adults rather than ten-year olds. There's very little violence. Nobody's head is removed with a hedge trimmer. There are a few shootings but never once do we see the shooter and victim in the same frame. The camera doesn't wobble as if held by a drunk and the pallet, though muted, is not drawn from the cadaverous green area. Felicitations.The story is basically simple. The never-smiling, extremely cool, Gary Oldman is George Smiley, part of some high-up British intelligence agency. It's 1973 and there is a Moscow Mule somewhere in the department. Smiley and one or two help mates finally dig him out. The biggest rat of all gets away -- I think.However, the screenplay meanders all over the place, with mostly passionless subplots that turn the film into a Cretan labyrinth with no Minotaur, just the labyrinth. You need patience to get through this; and a mature sensibility, not one attuned to instant and complete gratification.The two most tragic scenes.(1) Tom Hardy is a young British spy in Budapest who falls for the young woman he's squeezing secret information out of. Hardy himself is handsome, I suppose. He looks like Kevin Costner with Marlon Brando lips. But his girl friend, Svetlana Khodchenkova, is an absolute knockout with her blue tartar eyes. I wish the USSR had collapsed earlier than it did so we could have gotten to know her better, although, come to think of it, she was only seven or eight when the implosion took place. Anyway, she winds up with a bullet through her head. That's tragic.(2) One of the subplots involves an ex British spy, tortured by the Reds, now a stern teacher in a boy's boarding school. At first arid and unforgiving in class, he forms a friendship with a chubby little kid who is an outsider at the school too. But the teacher is drawn back into 'the circus' and towards the end, when the plain little social isolate tries to give him a present, the teacher curses and shoos him away, knowing that his peaceful, pastoral existence must come to an end. All of us murderers who work for the state must know how the school teacher feels.The cast is fine. I was happy to see the craggy face of John Hurt as 'Control.' He gave me such splendid support in the classic 'From The Hip.' I liked him too because he was shorter than I. The rest of the cast is equally good. Except for what I take to be the Etonian haircut, Benedict Cumberbatch as Smiley's reliable, homosexual assistant, reminds me of Kenneth Williams from the 'Carry On' series. Incidentally, the brief scene in which Cumberbatch's homosexuality is revealed, there is only one line of dialog that trips the viewer to what's happening: 'If there's someone else --' Otherwise, as so often elsewhere, you might not know what the hell is going on.",7,4,8,24 August 2013
The Hateful Eight," Torture Porn
","This increasing bloodiness -- and the anticipation of it -- is getting kind of tiresome, as far as I'm concerned, yet Grand Guignol seems to be rising from its grave, rotting and dripping, even as we speak.This is an episodic Western, chopped up into non-sequential blocks, rather like the bodies on comic display. It's the goriest Western I've ever seen. By the time it's over, not only are all the dead and the few living bodies covered with blood, but the floor of Minnie's Haberdashery, a shabby merchant store marooned in a fierce blizzard atop a snowy mountain, is an inch deep in blood.People die in various ways. There's the hanging of a woman with the camera on her venomous bloodied face as she strangles to death, a lot of shooting deaths, a black guy gets his head blown off with a shotgun, a man is stabbed to death, two or three poisonings with gallons of gore in each vomit, a man whose head disintegrates under a couple of bullets before our eyes. Some deaths are in slow motion. All are served up with relish. It's kind of 'The Outcasts of Poker Flat' except everybody winds up mincemeat.There are wince-inducing anachronisms. The MF word, a couple of expressions, and so forth. Some fine and witty acting can't save this mishmash. The score by Ennio Morricone comes close to it. The story isn't always easy to follow, and someone ought to spank Quentin Tarrantino, but if you want to see people die on screen, this is where the path will lead you.",3,6,14,17 December 2016
Gettysburg," Defines Epic.
","Who's going to want to watch a movie about the American Civil War? Oh, sure, maybe the public will watch an ageless soap opera like 'Gone With the Wind' but a movie about nothing but a BATTLE? No women in it? No slashers? No aliens or car chases or huge explosions or sex? Americans seem to have little interest in their own history. A recent survey of high school seniors found that a majority could not place the American Civil War in its proper half-century.In a way, it's not too bad to have moguls in charge of things instead of a committee of MBAs whose eyes dart first to the bottom line. It USED to be this way in the movies when there was still a studio system and the Louis B. Mayers and Sam Goldwyns and Harry Cohns could manage (or mismanage) their empires as they liked. It used to be that way in publishing too. Mr. Simon and Mr. Schuster and Mr. Knopf and Mr. Scribner could print whatever they liked, even if they thought it would turn out to be a quality loser instead of an immensely profitable but brainless blockbuster.That's all pretty much changed now, and a lot of people would argue not for the better. So you have to give Ted Turner a lot of credit for financing this expensive production. As Ronald F. Maxwell, the director, put it -- 'He followed his passion.' (Cf., Joseph Campbell, 'Follow your bliss.') You have to give the reenactors credit for following their passions too. I doubt that they were paid although I expect they were fed. For what it's worth, the staging of the scene in which Lt. Chamberlain chats with three Confederate prisoners is copied directly from a Winslow Homer painting.It's an excellent movie, blending character study with action. Of the performances, I thought among the best were Sheen as Lee, Lang as Pickett, Jordan as Armistad, and Mallon, who played Winfield Scott Hancock. Not that the other performances were poor. They're all up to professional snuff but, well, for instance, how much could Jeff Daniels do with a character who is a taciturn and inexpressive New Englander beyond speaking his lines woodenly? I should also mention Lancaster as the British observer. He's pretty good. He comes across at first as simpering and dressed like a bellboy in a fancy French hotel, but when the situation calls for it his head tilts back and his eyes narrow searchingly. He does a splendid job of being just friendly enough to absorb information without expressing any opinions about the events he witnesses. It's a small part but nicely done. Stephen Lang's General Pickett is a descendant of the cavaliers who settled the South, gentlemanly, proud, brave, and filled with a kind of Errol Flynn factor. Sheen's Lee is thoughtful, religious, and wrong in his decisions. Jeb Stuart has a small part, as he did in the battle itself. He was given to riding in complete circles around the opposing Federal army and he did it at Gettysburg too, but that wasn't his job.I won't go on about the story of the battle itself because, if the MBAs are correct in their assumptions about us, any further discussion of the battle would be a spoiler. So -- no hints about who won. (PS: There is no Confederate States of America anymore.) What a bloody and stupid war that was. Well, they all are of course, but some are unavoidable while others seem even more irrational than most. And the emotions generated by that conflict seem to persist beyond any real reason. It wasn't that long ago that roadside stands in the South displayed beach towels picturing a tattered Confederate soldier carrying the battle flag over his shoulder, and the caption, 'Hell no, we won't forget.' Why not? Nobody who fought that war is still alive. It's the sort of sentiment that will lead to the next war and the one after that.The production could have used more maps though. We get exchanges like this, between General Buford and a courier. 'What is Heath doing?' 'He says to tell you he's putting in his reserves, sir, but not all of them. What should I tell Heath?' 'Tell him to put in his reserves -- ALL of them.' Who and where is Heath? Why should he put in all of his reserves?",8,0,2,11 November 2005
We Were Soldiers," Portent of Things to Come
","I wasn't expecting much from this film because many of the reviews I'd read at the time of its release argued that it, and the book it was based on, were retrograde. The US soldiers provide the heroes and the North Vietnamese the villains. But it wasn't nearly so simple as that.Obviously it's been heavily influenced by 'Saving Private Ryan', at least in one respect. It's even gorier than SPR. If a phosphorous grenade explodes, we see the Grunt with the flaming stuff stuck to his skin and clothing, burning holes into him, and we see a buddy cutting away the burning flesh of his cheek with a knife. When a Grunt is caught in a friendly-napalm blast he really burns and afterward his charred flesh is blackened, so that when a buddy tries to take his legs and pull him towards a Medivac the flesh of both legs from the knees down peels off into his buddy's hands. And of course there is squib charge upon squib charge exploding in slow motion, an unfortunate cliché by now.One wonders just in passing how far this trend towards realistic gore can go -- and what the purpose behind the trip is. Well, it can't go much farther than it has. It seems just a short time ago that 'M*A*S*H' had one shocking scene in it -- a wounded soldier in a hospital whose arterial blood pumped out of his body towards the surgeon. Actually it was more than thirty years ago. But our cinematic carnage has progressed by leaps and bounds. 'M*A*S*H' was an early milestone. So was 'Bonny and Clyde,' which introduced slow-motion death to American movies. 'Saving Private Ryan' was a shocking blood bath. Now we have 'Blackhawk Down', with a still-living soldier whose lower half has been blown away. And now there's 'We Were Soldiers.'As for WHY there has been such an increase of realism in violence, well, that's a different question whose answer can only be guessed at. Many cinematic movements like this one seem to follow a trajectory in which each film must out-do the previous examples of the genre. If gore is good box office, then more gore is even better box office. There may be a sincere desire on the part of the producers to show combat as it really is, but like all motives this one may be mixed, with some commercial interests thrown into the stew. And the motives of the audiences who turn these films into marketable products? It would be nice to think that they leave the theaters having learned something about the results of combat. But if that's the case, we don't seem to be showing much evidence of having grasped the lesson. In a sense, sensational gore cheapens and degrades the experience of the men and women who have lived through these extreme situations. So much suffering brings tears to the eyes, especially when we see the survivors visiting graves and monuments after the battle, as we do both here and in 'Saving Private Ryan.' And then, having wept, the audience leaves the theater and embraces the next war. The arousal jag is over. Good intentions, when viewed from a slightly different angle, have an uncanny way of resembling exploitation.Okay. Enough philosophy. The movie is better than I'd expected it to be, the excess of gore and the slow-motion clichés aside. (I was also confused by the topography, although locations are clearly labelled. Where exactly is the creek bed?) There isn't much in the way of home-front scenes, but what there is neatly reflects the anxiety and pain of those left behind. The combat scenes are exhausting. A few hundred Americans opposed by some four thousand regulars of the North Vietnamese army. (About the same ratio of Americans to adversaries as General Custer faced, only he had no air support. Custer is brought up several times.) But, most important, this is the first film I can remember seeing about the Vietnam war in which the enemy is presented as something other than outright evil. There is a good deal of irony in the movie. Mel Gibson prays before the battle. Take us under your wing, and so forth, he asks. Then throws in, 'Ignore those pagans praying to a different God.' Much later in the film, long enough for us to have forgotten Gibson's racist plea, the commander of the North Vietnamese army is also seen praying -- presumably to the same God. And one of the NV soldiers is humanized to the extent of keeping on his person a diary written to his wife. (The soldier wears glasses so we can tell him from the other North Vietnamese and remember him.) He dies heroically and when the Americans take the diary from his body and flip through it, they find a picture of his wife, a woman who bears an uncanny resemblance to Gibson's wife, played by Madeleine Stowe. We win the battle (Ia Drang) of course, but even this is undercut by irony. The NV commander looks at the piles of bodies after the Americans leave. He shakes his head and says, 'What a tragedy.' The worst part of it, he muses, is that the Americans will treat this as a victory and the war will go on to its necessary end, although now it will mean just that many more deaths.Should you bother watching this? I think so. This one would have been a true original if it had appeared twenty years ago.",6,19,29,7 June 2003
Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid," Still Amuses.
","Everybody know this is a clever, anachronistic piece of commercial of offal, written by a wise guy and directed by a man of no artistic pretensions whatever, but after more than forty years this remains a charming comedy of two roguish and uber-handsome outlaws in the Old West.Newman is Butch Cassidy as Peck's bad boy, always leading the taciturn gun-slinging Redford, as the Sundance Kid, astray. Together, they have the sensibilities of Harpo Marx. It's 'based on a true story,' meaning half of it is made up. Katherine Ross as the real-life beauty, Etta Place, is pleasant to look at but seems here chiefly to prove that Butch and Sundance aren't queer, since she has little to do but undress and make predictions of doom.Some of the gags are clunkers ('Man, I got vision --') while others are pretty good ('This may be the garden spot of Bolivia --'), but that's true of most comedies.It was filmed all over the place and the location shooting and photography by Conrad Hall are exceptional. I imagine the long-distance shots during the pursuit were filmed in Mexico because it's getting more difficult to find sweeping panoramas of hills and mountains in a country that is now approaching a perfect state of urbanization, or rather suburbanization. One shivers with agoraphobia when he can look for miles in any direction and not see a telephone pole or a pall of smog or a Gold's Gym.Let's see. This was released in 1969. The year before, 'The Wild Bunch' had scored a big hit at the box office, so we have a thoroughly misplaced scene of slow-motion death here. (I blame Akira Kurosawa for starting the whole wretched business in 'Seven Samurai.') Of course 'The Wild Bunch' led to a host of imitations, but so did 'Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.' How many semi-comic buddy action movies followed? I have counted them. There were four hundred and forty-two imitations, not counting those in Urdu. I mention 'Lethal Weapon' only in passing.Here's another thing, propelled strictly by commercial considerations, that was imitated. Burt Bacharach's original score was contemporary, diverse, and colorful -- waltzes, polkas, rag time, a gallop, a successful pop tune. I always felt that Burt Bacharach's popular music during the late 1960s was inventive and surprising, a nice alternative to The Beatles, whom I enjoyed immensely. Of course Burt Bacharach's songs and movie scores were always middle-class but his talents seem to fit this film because nobody in it -- not Newman, Redford, or Ross -- sounds like anything other than middle class themselves.Anyway, it's a lot of fun.",8,1,1,6 August 2010
Ocean's Twelve," Don't Bother.
","It's not an insulting film, in that it doesn't pimp child molestation or religious righteousness. It's just poorly done.I imagine all the Big Stars up there must have had a lot of fun goofing with each other, just as the original Rat Pack did in the original 'Ocean's Eleven.' The director and the editor don't let the audience in on all the jokes. This is strictly a commercial product, clumsy and confusing in its execution.A good heist movie brings together a group of diverse characters and has them pull off a stunt whose points and junctures are made clear, one by one, so we can follow the shenanigans. It doesn't have to be comedy thriller like 'Topkapi'. It can be more of a character study like 'Bob Le Flambeur' or a thorough-going crime drama like 'The Asphalt Jungle.' But the plot must be CLEAR. This one isn't.One plus. Catherine Zeta-Jones never looked more beautiful and succulent.",4,0,1,5 February 2014
Crash," Through a glass darkly.
","What 'Traffic' did for drugs, 'Crash' tries to do for race relations, and to a lesser extent succeeds.The crash of the title, presumably, refers to the offensive behavior of ethnic groups and races to one another. But behavior must be justified, and the justification here (as in life) evolves from the prism through which we view society. As our sensitivity to tribal allegiances is heightened, so we tend to heighten it even more in a kind of vicious circle at the end of which the evil nature of the 'other' can simply be taken for granted.The movie does a pretty good job of showing how this distorted vision evolves, sometimes out of practically nothing. I guess I'll give an illustration of what I'm getting at. I'm white and my friend was African-American. This was in Philadelphia in the early 70s, when urban crime was rampant. On payday we cashed our checks, first at his bank, then at mine. I stood around in his bank awkwardly waiting for him, nervously imagining that the armed guards were eying me suspiciously as a potential bank robber, since I seemed to have no business being there. I said nothing about it to Bill because it seemed silly. Then we went through the same business at my bank except that this time Bill was left to loll around. When we were outside, he told me, 'You know, I think those guards were all keeping an eye on me because I'm black.' Racism, as it's usually called, is probably our most profound social problem and it is rarely talked about because it makes for clumsy conversation between members of opposite groups. But, as this movie makes clear, the prejudice is not entirely without justification. Prejudice seldom is. Abrasions, major and minor, build up animosities until individuals explode with anger or reach too quickly for the gun.'Crash' gives us a good picture of the way prejudice insinuates itself into our lives, often without our realizing it. Not that the movie is flawless. Compared to 'Traffic,' the seams show. The interlocking stories are rather mechanically spelled out for us. And instead of focusing on three stories, there are multiple narratives involving -- let me think -- whites, Iranians, African-Americans, Cambodians, Chinese, and Mexican-Americans. Absolutely nobody gets along with anybody else. And there is no figure who is able to transcend these animadversions. Don Cheadle could do it in 'Traffic' but his character can't do it here. And Sandra Bulluck is in this movie for reasons not immediately apparent to a viewer. The ending of the movie is hyped by a lugubrious score that shows us all of the major figures suffering, although we need neither the score nor the montage to tell us the fate of characters that the movie has spent all of its time spelling out in detail for us.Yet the movie carries more weight than most. It's more literal than it needs to be but its message is so important that it can't, and shouldn't be, ignored.Where does this abominable sentiment come from, this racism that Gunnar Myrdal saw right of the boat or the bat? Maybe the answer is as sad as the movie's ending. 'We have seen the enemy,' said Pogo, 'and he is us.'",7,1,4,2 April 2006
Snatch," Poikers et al.
","Let's reconstruct a scene from Quentin Tarantino's highly successful 'Pulp Fiction (1994).' Samuel L, Jackson and John Travolta are two hit men assigned to wipe out a couple of welshers. In the apartment they shoot two of the kids to death and turn to leave, when a third terrified kid rushes out of the bathroom and empties his pistol at their backs. Jackson and Travolta turn and look at the six bullet holes in the wall behind them -- every shot having missed -- glance quizzically at each other, then wordlessly raise their guns and blow the brains out of the third guy.Now, if that scene was funny, this whole movie is hilarious. It's vastly more stylized, with abundant slow motion, instantaneous cuts, stings on the sound track, and occasional subtitle, as well as a narration by Jason Statham. But, as in 'Pulp Fiction,' there are multiple narrative threads involving three black thieves, a mock-Jewish conspiracy, a Russian, corrupt boxing matches, and something about a priceless diamond as big as a ping pong ball. For lagniappe, in addition to Quentin Tarantino in excess, we get touches -- or snatches, if you prefer -- of Charlie Chaplin's slapstick, mostly involving a cute sassy mutt with a black patch over one eye. The dog gulps down a squeaky rubber toy and thereafter when barking he also squeaks. Sometimes he only squeaks. Later, after the dog swallows the diamond, the head villain orders him 'opened up' but the .50 caliber pistol bearing goon who has killed dozens of men is reluctant to shoot the dog.It's full of wisecracks, F-bombs, fast cuts, action, and assorted mishigas, all of which manage to subsume the plot with less difficulty than the dog had swallowing the squeaky rubber toy. The only time I cared about what happened to any of the characters was when the heavies burned Brad Pitt's Mum alive in the caravan -- a dirty trick if you ask me. It may be that Pitt gives the best performance in the sense that, though I could understand only about one word out of five from the normal characters, I could understand nothing at all said by Pitt's Irish tinker. 'Waw may' is actually 'Why me?'",6,4,9,19 November 2017
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," Superlative.
","The best black comedy ever made. I could watch it a thousand times and still laugh. Oh -- dated, sure. There no longer is a Soviet Union, although there are plenty of people willing to barbecue one another nuclearly -- as in India and Pakistan. I'd like to mention the writer on this, the late Terry Southern, who had lots of input into some pretty funny movies, not to mention his short stories or novellas. He's the guy who came up with 'pre-version.' Kubrik did a fine job. He lost his sense of humor afterward. The acting couldn't be better. George C. Scott embeds himself in one's brain as the general. And Peter Sellers. 'Look, Mein Fuhrer -- I can VALK!' They wanted him to play King Kong, the pilot, but it didn't work out. Doesn't matter. It's hard to imagine how he would have improved upon Slim Pickens. 'Two pairs a nylon stockin's. Two pair a prophylactics. Shoot. A fella could have a good time on this in Vegas.' Sterling Hayden as the mad general gives his best performance ever, even managing to inject a note of pathos into his delusions. For what it's worth, the final target they attack, 'the missile complex at Laputa', comes from Swift's satire, 'Gulliver's Travels,' in which Laputa is the name of a flying island.After the Doomsday Device has gone off and begun to irradiate the entire globe, Sellers, as Dr. Strangelove, opines that it might be possible for selected humans to survive in the deepest of mine shafts. I wanted to make some reference to a Mine Shaft Gesellschaft but couldn't figure out an easy way to fit it in. So I'm shoe-horning it in here. Not that it makes much difference because so few will twig. The final scenes. Credits roll. Atomic blast follows atomic blast whilst Vera sings 'Keep Smiling.' DO NOT MISS THIS ONE. If you miss it, you will miss something worth seeing.",9,2,3,9 June 2002
Scary Movie 2," Collage of Horror Bits.
","There's a lengthy introductory skit -- as in 'Twilight Zone: The Movie' -- that's a rip off of 'The Exorcist.' It's pretty funny, with bit parts for James Woods and Veronica Cartwright. The priest is playing the piano at the party when 'Regan' appears in the doorway, declaims 'You suck,' and pees all over the floor. She pees and pees, while the guests look uncomfortable. Finally, Mom rushes to Regans side and explains, 'She's been sick.' Then she slams Regans face down into the puddle of urine and begins to beat the back of her head.That was pretty funny because until that point you didn't know which direction the movie was headed in. But the introductory section ends in showers of vomit involving the two priests and Regan. Except for its residual shock value, it's about as funny as a pie fight.The rest of the movie, after the credits, is mainly a take off of 'The Haunting,' a fine film in its original form, directed by Robert Wise, and no more than a special effects extravaganza in the remake. Let's see. There is a lascivious poltergeist who is evidently a male and who chases a young girl across the ceiling after forcing her to have oral sex with an invisible penis. Which teen-age horror movie is that from? The ones with Freddy Kruger? I get them mixed up.Some of the bits are more revolting than funny -- a butler with a hideously deformed hand who manages to stick the grotesque thing into every dish he serves at dinner. A scene with James Woods on the crapper.Most of the gags are physical and except for the supposedly outrageous use of curses and swear words it might have been a silent movie. Not that it avoids ALL possible verbal wit. James Woods is the Max Von Sydow character from 'The Exorcist' and when he first enters the house, he asks how Regan is. Veronica Cartwright, as the mother, breaks into sobs and says, 'Father -- she won't even let me touch her.' Woods nods knowingly and replies, 'Yes, sometimes you have to give them candy.' It's nothing you wouldn't hear on a late-night talk show, but a little more of that would have been nice.I've concentrated on the first half hour or so because I didn't watch the entire film. The level of comedy or, more important, the KIND of jokes, became predictable and a little stale. Although you could never be sure. One scene is ripped off from 'Raging Bull.' I'm not sure the younger audience would get that one, but I'm even more certain that there were many allusions that I missed too.It was outrageous, yes, and some of the jokes were better than others, but I had no trouble shutting it off. It's the kind of thing best left to the kids.",6,1,3,24 July 2010
Pan's Labyrinth," Dorothy on a Drastic Bummer.
","The film had enough hype behind it that I settled in to watch it. In the first ten minutes I was considering watching an Agatha Christie mystery instead. At the end of fifteen minutes it had me and I couldn't get away.Ofelia, who should know better at fourteen, has childhood fantasies about fairies and fauns and monsters and magic cures. She lives in Spain in 1944. Her mother is having a troubled pregnancy and her stepfather is a sadistic murdering brute who represents General Franco. There a lot of special effects in the first ten minutes or so. A fairy visits her and beckons her into a labyrinth, at the bottom of which is a faun who gives her three scary tasks. She completes the first one okay -- feeding stones to a giant toad. She flunks the second, but, given a last chance, she succeeds at the third, which means giving her life for the life of her infant brother. She ascends into heaven and sitteth at the right hand of her long-gone real father, and the left hand of her newly deceased mother.What turned me off were those special effects. First of all, the fairy that visits her in her bedroom, the first time, is not my idea of a fairy. The fairy starts of fluttering around the room and making an ominous crackling sound. The first time Ofelia sees it, it looks like a cross between a stick insect and a praying mantis. I don't know if the producers intended it that way but the thing made my skin crawl. Ditto for the 'faun.' This is the least pettable faun in your collective unconscious. A stone statue creaks into life and turns into this hideous, demonic creature with monster ram horns, a thoroughly screwed up face, long pointy fingernails, hooves and whatnot. It speaks in a slow raspy voice that sounds as if it's lying with every phoneme. If that's the best fantasy she can come up with, she needs to get into Deepak Chopra or something. Gave me the willies.At that, it may be an improvement over the real world she lives in, a story that saves the film in my estimation. All these Spanish folks are just trying to get along, see, except for Franco's soldiers, of which Ofelia's stepfather is one. He has a nasty habit of going around shooting people, including, in the end, the young girl. He does it without passion, without remorse, even when the victims turn out to be innocent. Sometimes, I guess out of boredom, he allows a doomed prisoner to try brushing away the muzzle a few times before he finally pulls the trigger. On the other side are the communist peasants who live in the hills. They're the good guys and see to it that the stepfather pays for his sins.The special effects were overdone. It's as if they'd been designed by somebody on shrooms. Many of the fantasy creatures are covered with the glutinous substance that sticks to everything, and the sound people have made it sound as if someone is stirring a pot of molasses with a wooden spoon. It would have been a better film if the effects had been turned down a little bit. They seem intended to dazzle rather than convince, but the only people who will be dazzled would be children who haven't played video games or watched crummy monster movies. The effects are even overdone during the real-life story, as when the stepfather sews up his own slashed cheek. He didn't need to do that. First, he could have called the company medic who would have done a better job. Second, we've already witnessed this scene when Arnold Schwarzenegger plucks out his own eyeball in 'The Terminator.' It's not shocking. It's self indulgent.But, the CGI aside, it's an innovative movie. There have been other Spanish films about kids' fantasies ('The Spirit of the Hive') but this one is livelier and truly gripping. A person who has just been shot isn't yanked backwards like a marionette, the cliché treatment. He may hardly notice it at first, pause to remove his glasses, before slumping. The director will sometimes cut while a foreground object, such as a tree trunk, interrupts the flow of the images. And more than once there are other people witnessing a scene but they are hidden from us until someone waves aside the obscuring object, which may be an open umbrella. The shocks are effective and more subtle than anything in the fantasies. The movie really does resemble 'The Wizard of Oz' played as tragedy. We even get a pair of Ofelia's red shoes. The ending, of course, is a cop out unless you can believe, as some do, that fantasy life continues after we expire. And the good peasants didn't win, as they seem to in the movie. Instead, Franco lived on to a ripe old age and the baton was passed to his son. The film will break your heart, but it's a nice fantasy.",7,3,6,20 August 2007
The Way Back," The Big Hike.
","It takes a lot of patience to watch this long movie through. There is nothing to keep your attention glued to the screen. Nobody's head gets wrenched off. There are no high speed pursuits. Not a gun is fired. No explicit sex, not even gratuitous nudity. If the pace were any slower you'd think you were watching something by Werner Herzog.Peter Weir has shown a taste for the deliberate and the mysterious, especially in his early films. He has a taste for landscape, a sense of place, too. Here, there is not much mystery and the landscape overwhelms the characters until, as the footage rolls along, the characters become clearer and define themselves.In 1941, half a dozen men are penned up in a gulag in Siberia, some for good reason and some not. Conditions are utterly miserable. The men escape and trudge their way through a forest of snow-laden fir trees that looks like a Christmas card signed by Beelzebub because it's dark and dangerous. Wolves threaten. People freeze to death.The escaped convicts must avoid any villages because there is a bounty out on them. So they steal and kill their way through the Soviet Union, past Lake Baikal, to the refuge they seek in Mongolia. Except that they find Mongolia has shaken hands with Stalin. So it's on to China, picking up the elfin Saoirse Ronan along the way, then Tibet way up in the Himalayas, then finally salvation in India among the tea pickers of Darjeeling. About half the trekkers have survived the several thousand-mile walk, ragged, filthy, starving.Lamentably, Saoirse Ronan is not a survivor. It's too bad, too. She's a cute, pale, little pixie. I hated to see her go, not just because she was so fragile but because I could tell her from the men. That was part of the problem. We don't really know the men. We meet them in the gulag but for the most part they only exchange a few words. And when they're all covered with dirt, lice, and sweat, they all resemble each other. I could tell Ed Harris from the others, and Colin Farrel, because I've seen them before. But the main character, the one whose story we know best, the one we're supposed to identify with, is Jim Sturgess. He was a cipher to me. He handles his Russian accent well, as they all do. Russian accents aren't hard to do. They come easily to the native English speech organs, the way Irish accents do. 'So vare do you tink you are GOINK, Meestair?' See? It's not a dull movie, once you get past the introduction to the gulag and put on your pelzkappe. Some of the escapees don't change much, but some do. They begin as Darwinian survivors, every man for himself. But, little by little, they reveal themselves. Ed Harris's motto, as the cynical American, is, 'There's no room for sentiment on this trip.' He winds up caring for Ronan and when she gives up the ghost he can barely bring himself to leave her grave.The final scene carries with it a weighty sense of relief. Not just because the movie is over but because the suffering is.",7,1,1,19 August 2013
Knocked Up," Funny.
","It doesn't sound too promising. Seth Rogen picks up Katherine Heigl in a dance hall, both of them drunk. A night of passion and she turns up preggers. Abortion being out of the question (this is a romantic comedy) the two of them must struggle through he condition for the following nine months. The pregnancy threatens her job at a TV studio and his way of life as a profound wastrel. It not only sound unpromising, it sounds familiar. Two mismatched people fall in love, give up their selfish ways, and have a cute baby.Yet the edgy comedy is deftly handled by the director and the performers, even down to supporting roles. It doesn't get truly sickening until the last five minutes or so -- after the excruciating birth scene -- and during the credits, at which time we see home movies and still photos of all those cute cooing tykes that we'd so far been spared.It's raunchy as hell with F bombs galore and some of the funniest scenes depend on that vulgarity but it's not adolescent. It's fully blown and mature.As much impressive as anything else is the picture it presents of life in Northridge, California. Oh, how the mores have changed since I was their age. The talk among men in my youth was always industrial strength -- but WOMEN or 'girls' didn't use it, nor did young men use it when women were present. And even without women around, the curses were colorful but decorative. The swearing in this film is equal to that I'd only found in the military, mere punctuation with no semantic baggage. And the women use equally foul language. There's dope all over the place. And everybody hops right into the sack with whoever they pick up at a bar! Where was this life style when I NEEDED it? Oh, I'm -- I'm choking up. (Sob.) Seth Rogen is nobody's idea of a handsome man. At least I don't think so. He's chubby, has a halo of curly locks, needs a shave, and has a voice that suggests gargling. But he's a good actor and brings exactly the right characteristics to the role.I don't want to give away the jokes but I guess I can mention two, both involving small parts.(1) A desperately worried Rogen consults his Dad, the late Harold Ramis, and asks his advice. The advice? Stop worrying. Marriage is a wonderful state and children are a living miracle. Later, when Rogen's life is going to hell in a hand basket, he calls Ramis and shouts that the advice was all wrong. Reply: 'I've been divorced three times -- how could you have listened to somebody like me?' (2) The pregnant Heigl consults a Chinese obstetrician who quizzes her about bad habits the way an aggressive district attorney attacks a defendant. 'And how many cigarettes have you smoked? Hmm? How MANY?' You'll probably get a lift out of it. It's a knowing sort of comedy built around bits of reality that everyone will find recognizable.",7,0,1,2 May 2016
Alien," SF 'lost patrol' movie
","'Alien' follows the general conventions established by John Ford's 'The Lost Patrol,' his highly influential 1934 work.  It's been redone any number of times as a war movie or a Western.  Now it's in outer space.  The sub-genre looks something like this.  A small contingent of people -- a mixed group -- in an isolated situation are confronted with a rarely seen enemy who strikes out of the darkness.  There is no way to fight back effectively.  One by one, the group members are picked off, beginning with the leader.  This shifts the responsibility to the next in command, who turns out to be the lone survivor or, sometimes, the last to sacrifice himself or herself for the sake of the mission.But it's hard to recognize the basic plot under all the gloss.  This movie was something of a shocker on its release, and introduced a lot of innovations into SF movies.  For instance, in all earlier movies in which a team lands on an alien astronomical body there is no wind.  Here, there is a howling gale.  This may not seem like much, stated so baldly, but no one had thought of it before, although it's long been known that planets like Jupiter have atmospheres that are in a state of constant turbulence.
The monster was also a vehicle for a new, slimier conception of raw evil. This one is no Gill Man or furry pet with teeth.  This thing is positively reptilian in its detestability.  And it doesn't just 'do away' with its victims.  It begins by incorporating every revolting image from our worst nightmares -- a scaly muscular skate-like creature that plasters itself to John Hurt's face and embeds itself in his innards in order to plant a seed of some sort, which later develops into a juvenile that, in a famous scene, bursts out of Hurt's chest during a shipboard dinner that didn't look very appetizing anyway.  This was the first movie that could really turn one's stomach, what with jelly-like substances and gooey sounds.  Everything connected with the alien looks as if it belongs under a rock in a jungle. The f/x are outstanding.  If they look a little tired today it's only because they've been so often imitated.The performances are professional all the way down the line.  Sigourney Weaver has a strangely boney face and tiny mouth, but she's believable and turns in a good performance, especially for a Stanford graduate.  Her first name was plucked by her father from F. Scott Fitzgerald's novel, 'The Great Gatsby,' one of my faves.  Tom Skerrit isn't around that long, but he is so likably easy-going that we hate to see him disappear from the plot early on. John Hurt is a fine actor.  He was my supporting player in the art-theater classic, 'From the Hip.'  He's never done less than a first-rate job. Whatever happened to him?  Veronica Cartwright exudes vulnerability.  She needs protection as an adult as much as she did when she was a child in 'The Birds.'  In an interview she revealed that when the juvenile creature first appeared everyone laughed at it because it looked so much like a penis. Ian Holm as the robot is suitably cold.  He's a good Shakespearian too. Yaphet Koto is an earthy comforting presence -- while he lasts.  The alien itself doesn't have much screen time but makes the most of it, dripping all over with what looks like saliva.  It reminded me of a boatswain's mate I once had the misfortune to serve under.There are a couple of curious things that shouldn't get more than footnotes. The music is almost all taken from Howard Hanson, a moody and underrated composer, and effectively evokes distance, darkness, and the mystery associated with them.  There are also a couple of references to Joseph Conrad thrown in (eg., the name of the ship is the Nostromo) for reasons I can't figure out.  Maybe the writers or the director just happened to like Conrad.  It should also be noted that Sigourney Weaver's figure, while not bursting with femininity, is sleek and smooth and looks designed for underwater swimming.If you haven't seen this, you should probably try to.  The gross factor isn't very high, viewed from today's perspective, so if that's what you're looking for, rent Carpenter's regurgitative newer version of 'The Thing' or something.",Null,2,4,12 July 2003
The Book Thief," Endurance.
","A young girl named Liesel, Sophie Nélisse, grows up in Hitler's Germany and loses almost everything she cares about, yet she endures.The movie is narrated by Death. You have to handle Death carefully otherwise it turns into a cliché. Ingmar Bergman barely got away with it. Here, we don't actually SEE that narrator but his soothing voice is nice to listen to. He has a touch of humanity and a wry wit. On Liesl's childhood friend, Nico Liersch, 'His soul rolled into my arms very lightly.' On Liesel's frowning mother, 'I caught her in mid-snore.' Next time, try making Death a woman, preferably one resembling my high school girl friend, Agnes De Groot.You have to be careful about Nazi Germany and the Jews too, or it turns into something much worse than a cliché. It becomes a cheap shot at breaking hearts.'The Book Thief' has a young Jew in it, who shelters for a time in the basement of Liesel's father (Geoffrey Rush) and plump mother (Emily Watson). Liesel and Max become friends and Max teaches her to read.The movie, despite its over-used theme, is made for perceptive adults who don't need a kick in the pants to feel empathy for the suffering of the characters. The Nazis aren't all snarling beasts but at their best they're no more than men doing routine jobs. Nobody turns from a nice guy into a rabid Gestapo officer. Max doesn't get caught and crucified, which spares us another tour of the unspeakable camps. In fact, he walks off into the night and survives the war.Liesl's family, on the other hand, dies in a night-time bombing raid, along with Liesl's boy friend, Nico Liersch. Yet, though we see a row of houses disappear silently into a garden of flames, when the bodies are dug out they are already dead and gray. Only Liersch has time to gasp out an attempt at a declaration of love while lying in Liesel's arms but he (or the director) gives up and he rolls his head to the side and dies a Hollywood death.It's a sensitive movie. It's not challenging like 'The Tin Drum.' It's easily grasped because it's sentimental. But it is not insulting. Given the subject, for that reason alone it deserves a prize. It's a movie about people, not about cardboard cut outs.",7,0,1,3 April 2015
Black Mass," Turgid
","The movie is about James 'Whitey' Bulger, the notorious Boston mob leader. It ought to be better than it is. The style and subject matter are chiefly from Martin Scorsese, just as the musical score borrows heavily from John Powell's score for 'The Bourne Identity.' There are several of Scorsese's familiar overhead shots of table tops, amusing scenes of Bulger playing gin rummy with his mother, and so forth.I'll have to guess at why it doesn't entirely clear the bar. It's certainly not the subject matter, which has been a popular movie subject since the beginning of the talkies in the early 30s. Oh, we LOVE gangsters. The casting is flawed, for one thing. Johnny Depp looks rather like Bulger but he's so inexpressive that there's hardly any way of knowing what the character is feeling, especially since he lies so often. He wears the same expression whether he's kissing his son good-night or shooting a traitor in the back of the head.Dakota Johnson looks sweet beyond comparison but it remains to be seen whether she has chops. The figure who is almost as central to the story as Bulger himself is Joel Edgerton, and he's not very convincing as an FBI agent. It's unpleasant to watch his character and listen to him. The whole movie is unpleasant. The opening shot is a close up of a battered, ugly, snotty, pitted face -- poor Jesse Plemons.Since this is 'based on a true story,' we expect the narrative to be messy. That's life, right? But this story is sometimes hard to follow because the continuity is weak. Not by design, I don't think, as it was in Stanley Kubrick's work, but because the script was faulty.What the movie DOES deliver on is gore. People are battered to death, blood splashing all over the place. People are constantly being shot, sometimes for reasons that are obscure. And they're almost all head shots, except for somebody like Peter Sarsgaard who gets riddled with bullets and dies shrieking with pain, rolling around in a parking lot. (Cf., Joe Pesci beaten to death with baseball bats in Scorsese's 'Casino.') The FBI is involved in all this, one way or another, but they're hardly sympathetic figures.The reliable Kevin Bacon emerges with his dignity intact as does Sarsgaard. It's curious to see Benedict Cumberbatch in an American movie. He's a fine actor, though his accent sounds generically urban rather than Bostonian. Nice location shooting, by the way.It's not a bad film, not insulting, but it is sluggish and a little dull, uninspired except for the murder scenes.",5,1,2,10 July 2016
Battleship Potemkin," A Sailor's Life For Me.
","I saw this for only the second time recently and I'm not sure I can judge it properly. You sort of have to BE there in order to fully appreciate something new, and I mean 'appreciate' in the sense of 'recognize the quality, significance, or magnitude of' the thing. Any artistic or scientific product has to be judged in the context of its time and I've only seen a couple of Charlie Chaplin's movies from that period.This was released in, what, 1926? Eighty years ago. So imagine a viewer eighty years from now transported to our age, seeing only one or two movies, and trying to judge them. 'Die Hard 2'? A MASTERPIECE. It's in glorious color, dodekaphonic sound, superwide screen, a story that blends drama, excitement, adventure, period airplanes, humor, all in one superb Gesamtkunstwerk. But a time traveler wouldn't think so if he knew that a hundred other action movies, more or less identical, were being ground out like Superburgers at a Sonic Drive-In.That's the position most of us non film scholars are in with respect to films like 'Battleship Potemkin.' We KNOW it must be good because everyone says so. Directed by Sergei Eisenstein, the Gay Revolutionary given to triadic arrangements. But in many ways it's primitive. The officers aboard the ship look like stereotyped sneering villains. The characters, good and bad, are made of cardboard. We don't really get to know any of them well. The miniatures are obvious toys. And the acting is uniformly over the top.But from our current perspective, even with the most minimal of contexts, it's a gripping movie because of the theme and the way the director handles it. The first time I saw it the maggots on the meat were kind of disgusting. Shockingly disgusting material was still a rarity on the screen, though it's now commonplace. And the Captain of the ship is about to execute a dozen of his men because THEY REFUSE TO EAT HIS STUPID SOUP! Okay, that's one thing. But look at the way Eisenstein manipulates the detail in the scene when the execution is about to take place. The recalcitrant swine are huddled together on deck. A conventional treatment calls for them to cower against the rails and wait for the bullets. But no. Eisenstein spends time having them covered up with an ominous canvas tarp that gets several shots of its own. We can't see the men under the canvas. It's just a rough bubble with an irregular surface -- until one of the men under it faints and one of the bumps in the canvas slumps to the deck. Well, context aside, that's a pretty innovate statement. A less imaginative director would have spelled the whole scene out for us. The terrified faces of the men, the pleading, the sobbing, the praying. But Eisenstein trusts in the maturity of his audience and turns the incident into a rich display of mature taste. And that kind of realistic detail is used in other important scenes. When the wounded hero falls overboard he doesn't simply splash into the sea. Instead he lands on a snatch block, bent backwards, head and feet dangling a bit above the water, hanging for a moment while his mates dive in to save him.The blood comes later and there isn't much of it but what there is, is powerful. One bullet on the Odessa steps generates a greater emotional impact than the sight of all the gallons of Haemocolor Number Nine Red that Bruce Willis has shed in all his action movies put together. We can make a good guess that the one shot of the bullet hole through the eyeglass lens was an innovation because it's been copied so often since -- from dramas like 'The Godfather' and 'Bonnie and Clyde' to parodies like Woody Allen's. A guy with no legs running away from the bullets. I'd guess that was innovative too.The story is about the 1905 uprising that took place after the debacle of the Russo-Japanese war. It adumbrates the REAL revolution that came in 1917 during World War I. If the Czars knew what was good for them they'd have avoided wars whenever at all possible. (Change that from 'Czars' to 'heads of state.') Like all revolutions, though, this one left unanswered the question, 'Who's running things around here?' Certainly the church would have nothing to do with it. The priest who tries to quiet down the mutineers gets bonked for his pains and the crucifix embedded in the wooden deck.At any rate, historical context aside, it's a powerful movie despite any weaknesses. Eighty years, and we are still gripped by its images and its story. It can still rouse us, like those sleeping lions in Odessa.",9,2,2,6 July 2007
Taxi Driver," Urban Anomi.
","A truly disturbing movie. Travis Bickle (Robert DeNiro), great name, falls into a mood of brooding, amorphous rage and is frustrated in his attempts to murder a politician. So he wipes out a couple of low-life pimps instead.The story tracks him through his descent into insanity. Interesting folks are encountered along the way but have less impact than rubber bumpers have on a pinball. Cybill Shepherd and Peter Boyle, for instance. Boyle is one of a handful of taxi drivers, like DeNiro, who gather at a certain café to shoot the breeze on breaks. He's particularly funny in his working-class disinclination to think things through. 'Them queers' have to get married and divorced in California, he says wonderingly. I saw this in the Castro Theater in San Francisco and the audience erupted in laughter. When DeNiro asks for advice and gets nonsense in response, Boyle asks, 'What do you want, Bertrand Russell?' The film is unusual for Martin Scorsese. His most successful work has been with solidary groups, like small time hoods and the Mafia, in which there is an agreed-upon set of rules, and everyone knows everyone else. This one digs into urban anomie. 'Anomi' is a concept developed by the French sociologist Emile Durkheim and it means, essentially, 'without rules.' It's the kind of thing you experience when you drive into a vast strip mall parking lot and all the yellow lines guiding traffic have been erased. What do I do NOW, Ma? Scorsese is examining a social world that, as an Italian Catholic, he really has had little contact with. The film was written by Paul Schrader who, as an ex-Calvinist, is a little more familiar with this sort of ontological anxiety. It crops up in the production design. When DeNiro makes his unfulfilling meeting with Jody Foster, the twelve-year-old whore, it collapses in misunderstanding but in the background there are a multitude of Catholic candles. The climactic scene has a voice reading a letter to DeNiro from Foster's square Midwestern parents, congratulating him for an act that was ancillary to his own agenda, which was evidently to bring the world down around his ears.A film of the 1970s, it resonates less with audiences today. The racial troubles that were so headline-grabbing at the time show up less often in the news today. Not that the problem of race is solved, but the categorical thinking that divided us into two warring tribes has less relevance. The resentment simmers but has been cut off at the ankles, partly by our recent election of an African-American to the highest office in the nation. At the same time we have to admit that, as a nation, we are pustular with hatred for each other and for other countries that may not behave the way we want them to. Our leading presidential candidate has made it clear that he will go to war with Iran if Iran doesn't give up its nuclear ambitions. These attitudes come from the same place as Travis Bickle's. Most powerful shot in the movie: the camera slowly moves in on a bubbling glass of Alka Seltzer on the table in front of Robert DeNiro. All that fizzing is but one step removed from the explosion that is to follow.",8,10,16,29 March 2009
Shutter Island," Psychophagy 101.
","It's well directed by Scorsese, nicely photographed, the locations and photography are convincing. Very atmospheric. It's the kind of storm that would send me scurrying to the cellar.But I'm beginning to wish M. Night Shyamalan had never turned 'The Sixth Sense' into a successful movie, in which you can't tell the living people from the flashbacks from the ghosts from the hallucinations from the dreams.I was puzzled by the ghosts (or whatever they were) in 'The Shining.' Here's Jack Nicholson, heretofore troubled but sane, strolling into the deserted ballroom of the Overlook Hotel, slapping his hands on the bar, and saying with a big, welcoming grin, 'Well, HELLO, Lloyd! How's business tonight?' And the accommodating bar tender suddenly appears and replies politely. Well, we know Lloyd isn't really there. Is he one of Nicholson's hallucinations? After all, Jack calls him by name. But later there are ghosts with masks on that Jack has absolutely nothing to do with. I'll tell you, it's a conundrum. The mind boggles.'Shutter Island' has the same problem in spades. It's completely bewildering through most of its length. I finally caught up with it in the last five or ten minutes. It's even more confusing because the staff of the psychiatric hospital in which DeCaprio is a patient are playing roles that coincide with DeCaprio's delusions. Mark Ruffalo, whom I like, for instance, is in reality DeCaprio's primary psychiatrist but he's playing the role of DeCaprio's partner in the U. S. Marshall Service. The whole hospital is organized around DeCaprio's psychosis -- just to see if going along with his paranoia will somehow cure it.It's a nifty premise, but like the notion behind 'The Game,' it's not just improbable. It's impossible. 'The Game' was kind of enjoyable because it had its small comic moments but Scorsese clearly means this story to be tragic. 'Which is better,' DeCaprio asks his partner/psychiatrist at the end, 'to be a living monster or to die like a hero?' In other words, DeCaprio seems to realize he has a choice. He can accept reality and be the monster -- he murdered his wife. Or he can submit to a lobotomy and, somehow, go on being the innocent hero of the U. S. Marshalls that he once was.That lobotomy business is pretty aptly described, by the way. The operations began in the 1930s and António Egas Moniz, a Portugese neurologist, won the Nobel for using and describing the operation. Mostly it was a last resort and sometimes it worked, though with side effects. It was more or less discontinued after the discovery of anti-psychotic meds in the 1950s. If DeCaprio wants to go on living as a hero, he probably makes the right choice in choosing a lobotomy. It didn't usually rid the patient of his symptoms. It just calmed him down so he didn't act on them. DeCaprio will probably still think he's a federal agent but what remains of his personality will be a bloody stump and he won't care if they let him off the island or not.",6,3,6,23 June 2013
Capote," A Story of Two Men Who Had Something in Common.
","Richard Brooks directed an earlier version of Capote's book, 'In Cold Blood,' in 1968 that seems in retrospect to have been made for a mass audience. For the most part it takes the point of view of the killers, Smith and Hickock, their childhoods, their fantasies, their travels, their barbaric crimes. Truman Capote doesn't appear in Brooks' film. Instead there is a journalist (Paul Stewart) who shows up at the end to witness the executions and mouth humanisms about capital punishment.In this film, Capote is front and center, with capable support from Clifton Collins, Jr. (Perry Smith), Katherine Keener (Harper Lee) and Chris Cooper as the bitterly angry detective, Alvin Dewey. Phillip Seymour Hoffman is excellent as Truman Capote -- not just his impersonation, which is sometimes as difficult to understand as Son Soong's Cosmic Engine, but because he gives Capote a fully formed incarnation.Capote begins to look into the case for a New Yorker article about how the murders of the Clutter family affected the small town, but after the boys are captured and he begins to get to know them (particularly Perry Smith) the short piece begins to look sensational and very bookish in length. The problem Capote is faced with is that until the death sentence is either carried out or some other permanent solution is arrived at -- Capote has NO END for his story! Well, you can imagine the conflict he finds himself in. He's under pressure from his publishers to finish the by-now well-ballyhood piece. But he has become friends, in a manner of speaking, with Perry. And Perry's death turns into a tool for Capote's professional advancement, a consideration of which Capote is keenly aware. (In sociology this is called 'role conflict'.) It is to Hoffman's and the screenwriter's credit that they treat this conflict honestly. There is no doubt that Capote is sincere about his friendship with Perry and Hickock and his desire to see them live. He helps find a lawyer to represent them at their appeal. (It isn't until later that he realizes his work requires their death.) And he weeps convincingly at his last meeting with them. But this doesn't prevent him from lying repeatedly to Perry about matters such as who chose the gory title for Capote's book -- 'In Cold Blood.' Capote tells Perry that his publishers chose it just as a working title for a one-night reading and that he had nothing to do with it, and that he hasn't chosen a title yet. But we know that he proudly announced his decision about the title to Alvin Dewey some time earlier. He also dissembles in order to wheedle out of Perry the details of events at the Clutter farm so that the book's popular appeal will be boosted.So did Capote want the pair to be executed for the sake of drama? Or was he being sincere about his emotional involvement with them. The answer is 'both'. He was sincere, and then he used it as an instrument of manipulation. That two-dimensionality is what makes this a more adult film than Brooks' 1968 version. Capote, like all of us, is a flawed and very human moral entity.'In Cold Blood' indeed. Alvin Dewey asks Capote if the title refers to the boys' crimes or to Capote's attempts to get them off. Hoffman hesitates before replying, 'Why, the former.' The script at times seems a little generous with the Capote character. He's given to telling amusing stories about celebrities -- true enough. But during interviews he's given the presence and demeanor of a caring shrink oozing unconditional regard. It isn't until the end that we realize that this is partly, but only partly, a mask for his ambition. Over the phone, after the execution, he tells Harper Lee that he is distraught because he couldn't save them. Lee tells him not unkindly, 'You didn't want to.' The direction is functional, the pacing deliberate. The photography is really magnificent with arty, if somewhat derivative touches -- a long flat Kansas landscape with a tiny train rolling along the horizon. The Clutter murders are shown briefly on the screen. Perry's hanging is shown too, but not from Perry's point of view, as it is in Brooks' film, thank God. Details of executions pander to our basest impulses. 'Ted Bundy' is a good example of what I mean.Capote was a good, clear writer, and 'In Cold Blood' was a straightforward extended New Yorker piece, even if it was in book form. It was also a great success, critically and publicly -- 'a non-fiction novel.' It irritated the ever-envious Normal Mailer so much that he subtitled his next book 'The Novel as History, History as Novel.' Capote wrote several more fragmentary pieces about such things as the arrangement of paintings in Greta Garbo's living room, and he continued puffing his next book, 'Answered Prayers,' which didn't happen. The epilogue suggests that Capote drank himself to death because the effort of producing 'In Cold Blood' destroyed him, but maybe he'd just written himself out. Or maybe he figured he could never follow up such a glorious success. Maybe when you get everything you've ever wanted there's nothing left to live for.",8,0,1,28 March 2007
Barry Lyndon," An Uppity Irishman.
","The whole story of an 18th-century Irish kid working his way up and down through the world is staged by director Kubrick as a series of tableaux vivants. Tableaux were popular before movies, radio, and television, and before the introduction of posters of famous paintings or historical events. The participants in period dress would simple assume artistic poses, stand there properly lighted, and do nothing. They wouldn't speak or move.And that's pretty much a typical scene from 'Barry Lyndon.' Scene follows scene, in which several people in lavish dress stand in dramatic light and nobody's moving. It must have been deliberate and, to a certain extent it works. Let me put it this way. There is, say, a scene in which a game of cards is being played by half a dozen people sitting around a table. Everyone is as frozen as an ice sculpture. Then one person's eyes -- not the head, just the eyes -- look up from the cards. The eyes, let's say, belong to Marisa Berenson in an outlandish period costume. The gaze lights on the pose plastique figure of, say, Ryan O'Neal who is seated opposite Berenson, staring back at her. Well, the movement is minimal but it tells us all we need to know. There's a card game going on and O'Neill and Berenson fall for each other.Or rather SEEM to fall for each other because, in the case of Redmond Barry, O'Neal's character, he's not truly interested in Marisa Berenson's mind or her body -- just her title and her money. I think anyone would have to admit that this shows a certain shallowness on O'Neal's part because this is Marisa Berenson we're talking about. She's sinewy, has the eyes of a lemur, and is about ten feet tall. She can join that girl's basketball team along with Mariel Hemingway and Uma Thurman. If there were any depth to O'Neal's character, he would disregard her title and her money and her mind, too, and just be interested in her body. People with featherbrained values like Redmond Barry are disgusting.Anyway, though he began as a penurious nobody in the Auld Sod, he becomes Barry Lyndon, possessor of a fortune, a vast estate, Marisa Berenson, and a stepson who hates him because he sees O'Neal as the mountebank he actually is, a phony through and through.Not satisfied with a loving wife, a mansion and an estate the size of Crete, he overreaches when he tries to bribe his way into the peerage and before you know it the Lyndon family is on the verge of bankruptcy. Everyone is poor -- the family, the dozens of butlers and attendants, the coachmen, the livery men, the men who mow the lawn, the resident preacher, the live-in technician who maintains the computers.That feckless ambition and a mutual hatred between him and his stepson get him into a lot of trouble. He loses a leg, gets kicked out of the house with a small annuity, and disappears from the story -- back to Ireland, with occasional visits to the continent where he gambles and loses often.It's a pretty melancholy story, a sequence of achievements followed by loss. There's practically no humor. There's not much passion either. (The only real passion I can remember from a Kubrick movie is when the soldiers join the German girl in singing a simple tune in 'Paths of Glory.') There's an abrupt fist fight, two battle scenes, and a couple of duels but nobody talks much about their emotions. Emotions like love are conveyed with a glance or by someone's hand slowly grasping another's. Anger is shown with a frown. If someone is afraid, he blinks or gulps.But what a phenomenal feast for the eyes the film is. All these tableaux and blinks are done in settings that nobody has ever seen in a theater before -- vast halls, real candle light, sumptuous dinners, and make up that turns rich men into poufs. When O'Neal first kisses Berenson, I was worried that HIS lipstick might be smeared.Not all that much acting is required, and that may be all to the good. Ryan O'Neal, his name notwithstanding, seems unable to get hold of a decent Irish accent. (You and I could do as well.) And -- I can't tell whether he's handsome or not but I've never been impressed by his acting ability. He does okay when he's not speaking. The two little kids are great. Berenson doesn't have to say a word. Andre Morell's subtlety makes his small role a stand out.I've often wondered how novelists like Thackeray and the rest could turn out such long books with nothing more than a pen and a pot of ink. It would take half a lifetime just to copy them with the same instruments.",Null,4,7,28 August 2011
Full Metal Jacket," Definitely Kubrickian
","SPOILERS.  Nobody in Hollywood would touch Vietnam with a ten-foot pole until Oliver Stone's 'Platoon' became a 'major motion picture.'  It was followed quickly by Coppola's 'Apocalypse Now,' which had been in production for years.  And then came Kubrick's take, 'Full Metal Jacket,' which, being last in the series and therefore not much of a novelty, didn't get the kind of reviews the first two had gotten.A strange thing about all three of the films is that none was made by a first-line storyteller.  Stone's film was about good and evil that happened to be set in Vietnam.  Coppola's expressed his own obsessions.  (He announced to a French audience, 'My film isn't about Vietnam.  My film IS Vietnam.'  This got lots of applause because the French love big metaphysical statements.)  Kubrick's film has his fingerprints all over it. The lighting, the ironic humor, the static shots of people lined up motionlessly with regard to one another, the lowering skies of an unmistakable English twilight.  But, most relevant, its episodic structure. Kubrick gave us straight narratives, pretty much, with taut plots, until '2001,' when the structure became more, let us say, cubistic. 
This one is divided into two main parts, not quite independent of one another, although there isn't much overlap.  The first part is a hilarious and yet tragic view of Marine Corps boot camp.  R. Lee Ermy is fantastic and became a media icon after his performance here.  That the man is no real actor was demonstrated when he made a movie in which he plays a zombie or a pod person -- I forget the name of it, possibly a remake of 'Invasion of the Body Snatchers.'  You will find that your memory of Ermy's idea of a zombie is indelible.  Part two of this film follows Mathew Modine to Vietnam where he undergoes various adventures.  This second section is filled with jokes that only half hide their dramatic content.  'You've gotta hack it,' says a Marine to his dying comrade, 'you're my favorite turd.' 
And there is an exchange between Modine and a colonel in the field that has more resonance today than it did when the film was first released.  The colonel snaps at Modine:  'I ask nothing of my men except that they obey my every command as if it was the word of God.  We have to bring freedom to these people because inside of every gook there's an American trying to get out.  We've all got to keep our heads until this Peace craze blows over.'I think it's a better film than it's usually credited for being.  The comedic leavening doesn't stop it from ultimately being a tragedy.  It ends on a note that is a mockery of jolliness, the Marines marching back to base singing the Mickey Mouse song from the TV program that they grew up with. But Modine has just deliberately shot and killed a wounded young Vietnamese woman who was a VC sniper, forsaking the jokes that had enabled him to keep his distance from the others.  (Watch the transformation in Modine's features as he aims his pistol and pulls the trigger.)  Some bunch of Mousketeers.",Null,2,6,17 November 2003
The Grapes of Wrath," People That Live
","The movie itself is generally recognized as about as good (or great) as you can get, especially considering that it was shot in 33 days. But it often gets nailed for two scenes, one absent from the film, the other changed drastically. No Rosasharn is not seen in the film nursing the dying old man from her swollen breast. If the scene had been shot in 1939 (or even suggested), the movie would never have been released. The second problem often pointed out is that the ending is too upbeat, what with Ma Joad's carrying on about how men live their lives in jerks while women flow along like Anna Livia Plurabelle, and 'we're the people that live.' That last scene was written by Zanuck and was almost essential to a successful film in the late 1930s. Of course tragedies had been filmed for years, but ordinarily the tragic hero or heroine had earned his or her fate. Both audiences and authorities would have waxed wroth seeing an honest close-knit family crushed by an American economy that was totally inimical to their welfare. We need to look at art in the context of its time.From the Marxist perspective that Steinbeck used in writing the novel, Tom Joad (Henry Fonda) is the protagonist but the two most important characters are Ma Joad (Jane Darwell) and Casey the Preacher (John Carradine). Ma represents what Marx called 'false consciousness,' the tendency to attribute our misery to our own flaws, to bad luck, or God's will. Ma Joad's solution is retrograde -- to hold the 'fambly' together. Casey, on the other hand, discovers 'class consciousness.' It's not our fault. The flaw is systemic, and the solution lies in correcting the inequities in the system. Our allegiance has to transcend groups like the family and embrace all the exploited workers. The film endorses not Marx's revolution but a milder form of socialism -- the government-run labor camp with its democratic 'sanitary units', and the emerging union movement with its collective bargaining. Steinbeck's polemic is more acid. The novel has a reference to the extremely wealthy William Randolph Hearst (better known as Charles Foster Kane) who is described as have 'a mean face and a mouth like a a**hole.' There aren't many references to communism either in the novel or the film, just a few remarks about 'Who is these Reds, anyways?' Still pretty bold stuff for the 1930s with the public in one of its periodic Bolshevik scares!No need for anxiety, though. By the late 1930s the Great Depression was easing up, and World War II was about to bring it to an end. Bakersfield now looks as if Tom Joad had made a successful escape and decided to open a chain of organic food stores. This is a marvelous film. To single out just one shot, note when the Joads drive through the first starving Hooverville. The camera is mounted on the front of the old truck and travels slowly, without any cuts or dialog, through groups of wary, singularly ratty looking people, men and women, young and old, some resembling photos of criminals from old Police Gazettes, who 'don't look none too prosperous.' If nothing else, the film is a valuable corrective to the current view that people are poor because they're lazy. How did one third of a nation become so terribly lazy in the years following the 1929 stock market crash?",10,15,21,16 September 2000
Empire of the Sun," This Boy's Life
","Just after Pearl Harbor the Japanese move into Shangai, separating Jim (Christian Bale) from his parents. After wandering around the city for a while he winds up in an internment camp, tutored by Fagin, I mean Basie (John Malkovitch), in the fine arts of theft, arrogating the advantages of the dead, swapping favors for fancy golf shoes, and so on. Basie doesn't really care as much about Jim as he does about survival and in the end has no qualms about deserting him and his best pal, Joe Pantoliano, without a word or, as far as we can tell, a second thought. When the atomic bomb demolishes two cities, the Japanese leave the camp. Jim wanders around a bit more before his parents finally locate him and take him away.Now kids, before you get lost, this is World War II we're talking about here. The USA got into it in 1941 and it ended in 1945. Shanghai was on the coast of China and it was a very cosmopolitan city, and it's becoming one again. The Japanese fought on one side and the US, Britain, and China (more or less) fought against them. Now I hope you're paying attention because, if not, you will be punished by having to read a big fat book on Chinese history.The performances are pretty good. Nice occasional use of Chopin, but John Williams' score tells us what to think and feel in no uncertain terms. In this respect it serves as an almost perfect complement to Steven Spielberg's effective and technically superb direction. Every shot of an airplane -- whether a home-made model or a P-51 -- is accompanied by a heavenly choir. So are celestial orbs. During moments that elicit sentiment we have a Welsh lullaby. The whole film is evocative and visually splendid.It nicely joins art with artifice. Commercially it could be described as a 'crossover' movie. There's nothing much in it to offend any of the ethnic groups it deals with. Yes, the aristocratic Brits are a little snobby and unfeeling. And the Americans are scoundrels. But those are projections from inside the social borders. Brits and Americans can take it from one of their own. The Chinese for the most part are anonymous, except that once in a while they slap the kid's face while stealing his piano or a street thug beats Jim while trying to pull off his shoes in an alley. (I guess if you're going to offend someone you might as well make it the Chinese.) The Japanese are treated naturalistically. Some are friendlier and gentler than others but all of them show human emotions, even if the emotions are rage. We shouldn't be surprised that the Japanese at the internment camp whomp prisoners who defy their orders. My God, what they did to their own recruits at the Eta Navel Academy would make Parris Island look like Esalen. Japanese culture historically has been an odd blend of delicacy and cruelty, exemplified in the title of Ruth Benedict's 'The Chrysanthemum and the Sword.' The longest section has to do with the prison camp and it's a little confusing in its details although we get the general picture. Everything seems to depend on whether you can find those extra cigarettes or swipe an additional potato. Erving Goffman described this sort of 'total institution' and its 'small reward system' evocatively.It's a big and generous film that spells 'epic' with every frame. I don't know where it intended going though. There are some scenes that absolutely MUST have been lifted directly from Ballard's autobiographical novel. Footprints in the ashes that cover the bedroom floor. Jim, the central character, seems to have learned something. He begins as a superior snot, learns to survive while roughing it in a place where kids get no passes, and in the end comes full circle and goes home with his parents, presumably changed, in the sense of having discovered that, though survival comes first, there are boundaries beyond which behavior turns indecent.",6,8,20,6 April 2007
American Sniper," Center Mass?
","It's a gripping movie about a sniper in the Navy Seals who serves four tours in the Middle East and then is killed at home by a veteran he was trying to help. The scenes of action are well done, positively spooky, especially a fire fight in the middle of a sandstorm, where no one knows where anyone else is, or, if they see a figure, whether it's friend or foe. And it's informative. It never occurred to me that in the middle of a battle you could make a phone call to your home between bullets.But I was confused as to the movie's intent. If we take the story at face value, it's almost a cartoon. Very polite Texan boy learns to shoot on the prairie, then becomes a sniper after watching 9/11 on the television. 'Those men are my enemies.' 'I have to defend my country.' Are we to take that literally? Some of it sounds like a World War II comic book, the kind of remember so well. Not that Bradley Cooper as Chris Kyle has much to say. He's a bulky man with an ordinary face who says 'Yes, sir' and 'No, sir.' He swears little.And his career takes him to the Middle East where he becomes a hero. The shooting of an armed woman and an armed young boy doesn't bother him, nor does it bother the viewer for more than a second, nor is it shown in a way that should bother anyone.The fire fights are vivid and there is no question of Kyle's bravery. But then neither do we get much of Kyle's character beyond what little the film is prepared to tell us. Only once, does his tension break through that composed surface, when he almost kills a dog that is playfully wrestling with someone at a picnic.There is his wife and child at home, of course. He clearly cares deeply for them. Sienna Miller doesn't have much to do except unfurl the stereotyped role of the wife who wants her husband at home, not risking his life overseas. John Wayne's wives and girl friends always had the same complaint.Kyle's character is capable of making the kinds of harmless insults and jokes that abound in companies of men. He jokes about his wounded brother's having a two-inch penis. And he smiles. But then he always smiles except when there is no expression on his face at all. He's sincere throughout and dies ironically and, nicely, off screen in an epilogue.The movie leaps ahead and skips lightly over his SEAL training and all the rest of his initial adjustment to the military. And there are other gaps. We don't see him become the Number One SEAL sniper, a hero. We're told that he's such. The morality of the Iraq invasion is never brought up. That glimpse of 9/11 was enough. 'Blackhawk Down' never questioned our presence in Mogadishu, but was a far better film.I had a hard time making heads or tails out of his military career, his family life, or anything else about him, except that he's sincere, selfless, and motivated by patriotism. That's not telling very much about what's going on inside his head. And, not being the sort of man given to introspection, there may in fact not be much else. For whatever reason, he appears to have exaggerated his decorations. He claims two Silver Stars and five Bronze Stars with valor. More detailed records from Kyle's personnel file only reflect one Silver Star and three Bronze stars instead of the five he wrote about. As I said, I found it a confusing film into which almost anything can be read -- or it can be taken as the simple, integumental story that we see, without thinking about it.I find it more difficult to grasp what Clint Eastwood is getting at as he grows older. His early films were mostly junk about comic chimpanzees and uninteresting cowboy figures. But then he directed 'Unforgiven,' which raised a multitude of challenging questions.'American Sniper' poses a question too: What is 'American Sniper'?",5,9,16,4 August 2015
Glory," Overall fine; in detail flawed.
","There were complaints that Mathew Broderick was too short and unimposing to play Robert Gould Shaw, the Colonel who led the 54th Massachussetts into battle and dismemberment. I don't think I agree. Why should a courageous and even heroic man be made to look like Michelangelo's sculpture of Moses? Weren't there ever any SHORT heroes? As far as I can discern, from what little grasp of historical events I have, the general outline of the plot sticks pretty close to the facts. I don't know that Frederick Douglass was still as prominent in 1863 as he had been earlier. Maybe he was. As the events unfold, though, they ring fairly true. The narration by Broderick is lifted directly from Shaw's letters to his family and they reveal a self-doubt, a contrarian conviction, a dignity, an objectivity, and a humility that all the rest of us must envy. His role in the film is similar to that of Liam Neeson's in 'Schindler's List' or Richard Harris's in 'A Man Called Horse' or Kevin Costner's in 'Dances With Wolves.' He is 'our' liaison to 'them'. Shaw was educated, white, and socially prominent so we get to know a lot about him and the milieu in which he was raised. The Colored Troops, as they were called at the time, are only sketched in by the writers, and only sketchily sketched. There is the angry ex-slave, the wise old man, the good-natured but dumb squirrel shooter, and the poetry-reading New Englander who gets the crap beaten out of him by a racist Mick Sergeant -- for a lofty cause, naturally, as all sadistic drill sergeants are quick to point out. They look a little too much like the crew of the original Memphis Belle. If they were white, there would be a street-wise tough guy from Brooklyn and a braggart farm boy from Texas. The stereotypes are functional, though. Most stereotypes are.The structure shows us that not all 'blacks' were the same. Nor were all 'Northern whites' the same. Cliff DeYoung is a Jayhawker, an ex-slave owner, now an abolitionist, who believes his men must be treated like children. There was a lot of that going around. Darwinism was still a radical idea, less than ten years old. Nobody had the slightest idea of how humans had evolved and in the absence of DNA and other biological evidence of racial relationships, judgments were made on the basis of traits that have been shown to be superficial -- hair texture, skin color, the shape of the soft parts of the face. African-Americans were easy targets for displaced aggression just because they looked so different and there were so many of them around. Irishmen stepping off the boats were faced with being drafted into what was thought (wrongly) to be a rich man's war and a poor man's fight. The draft riots of New York City killed more than a hundred people, most of them black, including some in an orphanage.There were some monumental historical dynamics at work at the time, but no space to go into them, and they're most irrelevant to the movie anyway. (May I suggest reading Bruce Catton's books on the Civil War? Or MacPherson's Pulitzer-Prize-winning 'The Battle Cry of Freedom'?) Broderick does pretty well by his role. He toughens up as he goes along. Cary Elwes looks handsome and acts as a humanistic counterbalance. Among the troops, Morgan Freeman is excellent, as usual, though his part doesn't offer him that much to do. What a fine actor he is. And Andre Braugher as the educated New Englander who is a poor soldier is outstanding as well. Denzel Washington was adequate without bringing much else to the party. The score is so bloated with 'glory' that it really belongs to some epic about The Second Coming.Perhaps the scene I found most amusing involved Braugher and the rest debarking in South Carolina and bumping into some local ex-slaves. Braugher is unable to understand them because they're speaking in Gullah dialect, in which a 'buckra man' is a boss or, by extension, any white person. The most disturbing scene involved my watching this in a theater in which the audience was largely black and being almost deafened by screams of exhortation as the Colored Troops shot and bayoneted whites. I wonder if Gunnar Myrdal may have been right about race in this country.",6,4,11,23 February 2007
The Passion of Joan of Arc," Horrifying Masterwork.
","There's no doubt about Dreyer's 'The Passion of Joan of Arc' being a work of genuine poetry. Nothing like it had been seen before. The performances are nearly perfect, although Maria Falconetti as Joan of Arc has few light moments, as you can imagine. Dreyer's direction was all new to the screen, mostly low-angle close ups. The set direction was similarly innovative. All the rooms are spare and brightly lighted. Even the torture chamber is clean and uncluttered -- no pots of oil bubbling over a fire, no hairy greaseballs going grimly about their tasks. We get a hypnotic glimpse of a spool of spikes whirling, and what appears to be some sharp and jagged farm implements hanging on the wall.I don't know where the Dreyer managed to find such faces. Some of the bishops have warts that look like boils; some have handsome and earnest features. The dwarf-like low-lifes who tug her from place to place caper and giggle with glee at Joan's distress. BOY, does the church want her to sign that paper that will at once save her life and betray her belief in God's message.But I can't watch it more than once or twice. There's very little in the way of torture -- nothing like today's movies with bath tubs of gore and screams so loud they launch your basilar membranes into a tarantella. Joan is feverish and faints and the good doctors bleed her, as is the custom of the day, and that's it for foreplay.But when she burns, it seems to take forever, and Falconetti's face goes through one expression after another, like a chameleon changing its pattern. It's too painful.Am I permitted to add a little note, not directly related to the film. In the last 1960s, the critic Stanley Kaufmann was teaching film appreciation at Columbia. He showed this movie and asked for responses. They ranged all over, comparing it to Preminger's movie about Jean Darc, the actual historical figure from both the French and English perspectives, and so on. It was one of the reasons Kaufmann was prompted to write 'The Film Generation,' predicting that in the future classical movies would have virtually replaced literature as the principal art form. Within twenty years, he retracted his prediction, having found that in the intervening years the intellectual reach of his students had regressed to the mean, or perhaps dropped below it. Anyway, you may not want to watch it often either, but you're not likely to forget it.",8,2,4,23 December 2012
Gone Baby Gone," Truth and Consequences
","Some keen dialog here. Boston policeman, Ed Harris, to Private Investigator, Casey Affleck: 'Look, just forget what I said the other night and we'll be friends.' Affleck: 'And if I don't?' Harris: 'That's not the kind of 'if' you want to bring into your life.' It's the story of a three-year-old girl apparently kidnapped from her single mother, Amy Ryan. Ryan's sister hires two amateur young sleuths from the neighborhood, Affleck and Michelle Monaghan, to poke around and see if they can turn up any leads on the girl's whereabouts. The police, Ed Harris and Morgan Freeman, as a captain in the BPD, cooperate reluctantly.The cops advise Affleck to give up the search because the girl must be dead, but he and his partner persist, leading to a couple of deaths, including that of the child who is evidently drowned in a quarry. Some time passes. A friend gives Affleck a hint about a child molester. Affleck calls Harris and as they approach the house, more shootings and deaths occur. I'm being deliberately vague because this plot is full of twists and odd plot turns, many of the most important ones revealed in momentary flashbacks. The result of this directorial decision, unless my brain is turning to tofu, is some confusion about the details of events. Anyway, I'll let the plot go at this point.The general impression a viewer gets from the movie is that Boston, the city that gave us Paul Revere, Benjamin Franklin, Indian pudding and the baked bean, is now about as ugly and dangerous a place as New York City. This is a very naturalistic movie, meaning you don't get to see any ritzy restaurants, there is no shot of the Old North Church, and nobody goes water skiing on the North Shore. The F word is used exactly one million, two hundred, and three times. I counted. There is little bonhomie. Most of the people seem to slouch around in black Gothic rags with crucifixes or St. Christopher medallions used as fashion accents. A goodly number smoke marijuana (Gasp!) or snort coke, even after it spills on the floor. Bad guys may die, but so do good guys, and some of the best of the good guys wind up in the slams for reasons that are at best arguable.And that's the crux of the film -- that arguable quality. Should a person live according to inflexible principles that may be too lofty for practical use? Would you insist on telling the truth, though the heavens fall? (See 'Prince of the City' for an examination of a similar dilemma.) More specifically, if you found a child who had been kidnapped by a loving family, would you insist that she be returned to her immoral and uncaring biological mother, knowing that in doing so you would see the law upheld but would be consigning the child to an almost certainly wrecked life? Casey Affleck is the central figure, and he provides a sketchy narration. It's hard to judge his performance. He displays little range but maybe that's how he's decided to draw the character. His voice has all the semihemidemiquavers of Jimmy Stewart's but none of the expressiveness. Morgan Freeman is impressive, as always, a sublime actor. Michelle Monaghan's character seems to be in the film in order to prove that Affleck is heterosexual and to provide him with something to risk losing. The best performance may be given by Amy Ryan as the child's flawed mother. It's a most difficult role, too. Ryan has to walk a fine line between genuine but fleeting motherly instincts and frivolous self indulgence on the other. It's hard to see how anyone could have done better than she did. Ed Harris does well, too, as the cop who is willing to recognize a distinction between formal principle and pragmatism, and to be willing to sacrifice for a good that is outside the law. But then everyone is pretty good. Not a sour note in the bunch.Warning: Children under the age of 35 may fall asleep. This movie is made for adults. Shots are fired in only two scenes, and they are mostly pops and flashes in the background. There is no sex or nudity. There are long scenes in which nobody wrenches someone else's head off and pees down his neck cavity. They just sit and talk. The film doesn't provide instant gratification -- not during the meandering unfolding of the plot, nor at the end.Ben Affleck directed. He needs a little seasoning but his judgment is generally good. The script is a bit weak in presenting us with that dilemma, by the way. The protagonist is in a quandary over whether to punish good guys for breaking the law in order to achieve a greater good. But that makes him more than ordinarily extrapunitive. After all, earlier he murdered a helpless child molester and THAT doesn't seem to bother him much. He's better at forgiving himself than at forgiving others. The script kind of skips over that little problem. See it if you can. You won't wind up whistling a happy tune but you might find yourself wondering about the issues raised here.",8,3,5,6 August 2008
Southpaw," The Moral Equivalent of War?
","Jake Gyllenhaal and Forrest Whitaker are up to par in this knock-kneed drama about pugilism. Whitaker always brings a little something extra to each role, rarely menacing, rarely perceptive, but always listening carefully. Gyllenhaal, as has become traditional, is bloodied in the boxing ring. He has three things going for him as the movie opens. He can take all kinds of punches without falling down. (Watch De Niro do the same in HIS boxing movie.) He's motivated by anger. And he loves his family, the cute Rachel McAdams who isn't around long enough, and his devoted daughter. He's so good, he's the champion. Of course his face is all misshapen and his wife wants him to quit the ring but he's pretty uneducated (he can't spell 'incarcerated') and it's all he knows how to do. His speech is already slurred.At a party he meets the rising young star, Miguel Gomez, who is a very savvy and skilled fighter. Gomez flings a few ritual insults at Gyllenhaal's wife and daughter and the champ, being what he is, loses it. A fracas breaks out. Someone produces a pistol and McAdams is shot dead. As a result Gyllenhaal goes on a self-destructive binge and loses everything -- his house, his little daughter, his self respect, the esteem of the public, and the championship. He's now a bum living alone in a shabby hotel room.Of course we've been here before -- the sports hero battling his inner demons. And here, as elsewhere, and as my TV Guide puts it, he seeks redemption. I wish that word would disappear from our vocabulary because it's so overused. Listen, I had to learn about 'redemption' in Catechism and redemption is when you do some terrible wrong and then make up for it by becoming sort of spiritual and by doing good works. 'Redemption' does not mean 'success regained.' It's closer to what Freud called 'undoing.' The only person Gyllenhaal abuses is Gyllenhaal.That reminds me of my own career in the ring. In boot camp, they had try-outs for the boxing team. I knew nothing about boxing but my good friend Andy from Michigan accompanied me to the gym. He and I were outfitted with gloves the size of throw pillows and told to get in the ring and fool around. Well, Andy and I were buddies and didn't want to hit one another so we danced about and finally, bashfully, Andry swung his glove around in a long, slow loop large enough to trace the equator. I saw it coming and watched it curiously as it approached. It barely touched flesh and I was on my knees. End of ring career. Where was I? Yes. Well, now a desperate bum, Gyllenhaal finds an amateur trainer, Whittaker, and works his way up from cleaning the toilets to challenging Miguel Gomez for the championship. I will let you guess who wins. The scenes in the boxing ring are well done. When a guy misses, he misses fast, and only by half an inch, not by a mile. And the fighters actually seem to tag one another realistically. Whap -- a jab and the opponent's face is visibly knocked back.That's about the end of the good parts. Antoine Fuqua directed and he seems not to know when to leave well enough alone, or else he's aiming for an audience of semi-moronic Neanderthals who can't tell that Gyllenhaal is being crushed while he cradles his bloody and dying wife in his arms. The scene is full of blubbering and cries and lasts about as long as the Mousterian Age. It's not just the direction. There is no evident motive for his daughter's alienation. I suppose she blames her Dad for her mother's death but it seems hard to understand why she should, since Dad had practically nothing to do with the shooting. (Impressive performance here by Naomie Harris as the Child Care Worker charged with the daughter's welfare.) Whittaker teaches Gyllenhaal to fight as a Southpaw but nothing at all comes of it. The final bout is touted as 'a revenge match' -- repeated over and over. But revenge for what? Miguel, Gyllenhaal's opponent, had nothing to do with the killing, and neither did Gyllenhaal himself.One wonder if it's at all possible to make a sports movie WITHOUT the hero falling from grace and finally 'finding redemption.' 'Rocky' -- the first 'Rocky,' not the egregious sequels -- was a good film about boxing and character and it ended realistically in a draw. This one is crowded with clichés and, what the hell, if the hero wants to find redemption let him join a monastery.",5,0,1,3 December 2016
Bridget Jones's Diary," Fantasy Numero Uno.
","It's an amusing romantic comedy with Renée Zellweger is a plumpish woman on and after her thirty-second birthday. She's single and nothing much is going on. She seems cheerful enough about it all but she decides to begin life anew, starting a diary and making resolutions such as losing fourteen pounds and cutting down on the drinking and smoking.Zellweger works in a London publishing house and begins to wear short skirts and rather vulgar see-through blouses to the office. Soon enough she's flirting with her boss, the ever sly Hugh Jackman, and soon after than they're in the sack together. She begins to get a bit mushy and asks him if he loves her. For that, he buggers her for the second time.Well -- does he love her? Is he willing to 'commit'? (That's code for 'willing to get married.') Evidently not, because she pays him an unexpected visit one day and finds a luscious babe naked in his bath room. The babe eyes Zellweger with a smirk and remarks, 'I thought you said she was THIN.' Ouch.Meanwhile, always hovering around the background, is the successful but stuffy and decidedly unchic Colin Firth. Zellweger has loathed him at first sight. He never smiles or flirt or jokes around like the roguish Jackman. Not much fun, you know. But one day he takes her aside and tells her grimly that he 'likes her' just the way she is. Coming from him, that's a Niagara Falls of a confession. In the meantime, though, Jackman has abandoned all his girl friends and tells Zellweger she can give him rebirth. That is, he's now willing to get married and so, it develops, is Firth.At a dinner one night at Zellweger's flat, Jackman and Firth run into one another and have a fist fight over her. Now this has got to be female fantasy Number One -- two men fighting over you, a plain girl with not much going for her but brains and zest. And they're both successful and have other women salivating over them. Wow. I won't claim it began with Jane Austen's 'Pride and Prejudice' because I'm sure the theme goes back in history through the Greek masques, and is lost finally in the mists of antiquity. (For men's fantasy Number One, viz., The Conquering Hero. Start with 'Rocky.' Go back to 'The Iliad.') Much of the wit lies in the writing itself, full of irony and vulgarity. There are a few slapstick scenes -- Bridget trying to cook -- that hark back to 'I Love Lucy' and Laurel and Hardy. They're still funny and the absurd characters are well defined.Zellweger is a decent actress and though hefty she has an engaging blue eyes and a smile that could brighten a room. Jackman is his usual on-screen self, stuttering slightly, a little embarrassed at times. Firth is unpleasant and stiff but Zellweger has juice enough for both of them and she'll turn him into a paragon of élan before you know it.",6,0,0,6 March 2015
American Hustle," New Jersey, The Garden of Evil State.
","If you liked Martin Scorcese's work, especially 'Casino,' then you ought to love this one because the writer/director, David Russell, is to Scorcese as Brian De Palma is to Alfred Hitchcock. Not only is the plot redolent of 'Casino' or 'Goodfellas', but the techniques belong to the same family -- loud intrusions of 70s pop tunes, rapid dolly shots into someone's tense face during a crisis, the romantic troubles of the con man hero with his jealous wife and his smooth girl friend. There are narrative comments here and there by two of the actors.Christian Bale is surprisingly good as the small-time New York Jew who promises to get desperate people a loan of fifty thousand dollars for an irrevocable fee of five thousand, then just keeps the five. Good accent, Chris. But he fades from view about a third of the way into the movie and has only minor functions until the last few minutes.Amy Adams, as the very savvy phony English aristocrat who is swept up in Bale's schemes, is very, well, sexy although her innocent features seem to glow with the freshness of a Kansas sunflower. The director was courageous enough to give her a few scenes with her hair up in those ugly plastic curlers, while she wears no discernible make up. And, though pallid and washed out, she STILL looks pinchable.Jennifer Lawrence, who has been in the news a lot lately, looks a little like the younger Leelee Sobieski, something in the slant of her eyes. Her character, the bitchy and conniving wife, was a surprise. I thought that someone whose celebrity depended partly on the hacking of some nude photos wouldn't have much juice, but she can act. She's not as radiant on the screen as Amy Adams but she's not supposed to be, what with her hair piled up into a pompadour, something resembling a fire plug on top of her head and her overall witchiness.The plot has the confidence team of Christian Bale and Amy Adams being caught by the FBI in one of their transactions. The agent in charge is Bradley Cooper (who also curls his hair into little knots) and he sort of cons them into pulling their stunts on other illegals and on politicians so that he, Cooper, can make a big name for himself. Cooper does his best to keep his hands off Adams, but he manages to come out of the affair the most vile of the bunch. A touch of Sidney Lumet. (See Lumet's 'Prince of the City' for a comparison.) But then, whatever interest the story and the performances had is drained by the imitative techniques, which go far beyond Martin Scorcese into some kind of decadent hell. The actors must have been told to improvise some bits of business because some of the exchanges sound exactly like improvised bits of business from other films.Adams and Lawrence have a vicious exchange in the ladies' room. 'You're all gross inside.' 'I'M all gross inside? YOU'RE all gross inside.' 'Maybe we're both gross inside.' I didn't make that up. Nor am I making this up: 'Waddaya mean?' 'Waddaya MEAN, what do I mean?' The film is too long by, say, half an hour. And some of the actors must have been given free rein in their improvisations because the scenes become unbelievably raw, ridiculously excessive, shouting and screaming, smashing furniture in a fit of pique.I hope Russell makes more movies because a successful film, not commercially but emotionally, is just a matter of successive approximation.",5,3,7,13 January 2015
Top Secret!," How Silly Can You Get!
","Lots of fun in this shambling parody of a dozen different genres, mainly those in which the good espionage agent is sent into enemy territory to rescue an imprisoned scientist, climb fortress walls, outwit the Gestapo, uncover a spy in the midst of the resistance movement, slaughter innumerable Germans, make love to a beautiful woman, and do Elvis impressions.Some of the gags are pretty inventive. A giant telephone looms in the foreground of the shot and when it rings a man in the distance marches up to it and picks up -- a giant phone. A man falls off the wall of a fortress and does one of those carefully times head-over-heel flips that stunt people have perfected and when he hits the ground, he shatters because the figure is made of pottery.Others come across as rather too extended. At least a minute is given over to a scene in a bookshop -- one take -- that's filmed backwards and has the dialog backwards as well. It's funny, but it must have taken a long time to get the whole thing right. Every backward movement must be timed perfectly. Eons, geological epochs must have come and gone during rehearsals. Dynasties rose and fell. And the novelty is worn off as soon as we get the joke, which is about ten seconds into the skit.And one Elvis number would have been enough for me, but I had to sit through three -- I think. Maybe it was four.Val Kilmer is very pretty but acts as if he can't act. Later, when he was over the top of that cinematic arc, he turned in a splendid performance in 'Heat.' He does, however, capture Elvis's kinesics very well. Not that they're at all suggestive. No, no. As The King himself put it, 'I don't make no dirty body movements.' Best male performance in a slightly-better-than-average comedy: Jeremy Kemp as the German General Streck. He's absolutely marvelous with that pocked face and thick neck and built-in sneer. His German accent is convincing too.The object of the parody gets a little mixed up at times. The East Germans are all dressed like Nazis from World War II. And they act and speak accordingly. But of course East Germany at the time was under the domination of the Soviet Union and was dying from an excess of communism. Still, the Germans are always good when you need a villain. It seems that we've never been able to forgive them.",6,2,4,4 March 2009
The Godfather: Part II," Excellent dramatic story.
","I suppose everyone already knows the story -- Al Pacino as Michael Corleone rises to power in 1958, with multiple flashbacks to Robert DeNiro as his father Vito in the 1920s -- so we can dispense with a summary. Actually, the story itself is less important than the fact that the film naturally divides itself in two -- its execution and its moral message.The execution is splendid in every regard. Coppola's direction is deliberately paced. There is a conspicuous absence of unsubtle and dizzying directorial razzle-dazzle, thank God -- a movie that doesn't give you a headache.The performances are nearly flawless. There isn't a sour note in the entire cast, and especially outstanding is the acting of Lee Strasberg, Michael V. Gazzo (author of 'A Hatfull of Rain'), and Gastone Moschin as Don Fanucci, who tackles the role with an understated grandiosity -- what operatic flourishes! But everyone is good.The photography by Gordon Willis, as in its predecessor, is dominated by a burnished amber except for wintry Lake Tahoe where various shades of blue and a steely gray predominate. The production designer deserves credit. Nino Rota's orchestral score is memorable, a folksy melancholic tune. The script has some neat tag lines. When Strasberg and Pacino meet, they shake hands and exchange warm wishes, then when Pacino admits that he's going to kill a colleague of Strasberg, the latter shrugs, turns to his tuna fish sandwich, and says, 'He's small potatoes.' It's a chilling moment. The avuncular, sentimental old man is a ruthless murderer. That's the execution. The -- I don't know what to call it. I don't like the term 'moral of the movie.' Sounds like a high school term paper. And I'm not sure exactly what 'intentionality' means in phenomenology, so I'll just say 'intention.' The intention of the film is thoroughly corrupt. Maybe Puzo and Coppola realized it, maybe not.I think the director did, though. That's why he splices so much carnage into the rituals. Almost every scene of violence takes place during some sort of party or religious festival. I think -- I HOPE -- that Coppola was aware of the irony between the rites of intensification and the fact that the principles they embody are ignored almost at will. It's important to have your baby baptized as soon as possible, just as it's important to shoot a miscreant in the chest.In a sense all the rituals, all the religion, are fakes. There is no license permitted, unlike Irish wakes, Polish weddings, or Russian parties. If, like Gazzo, you have too much wine and accidentally spill some on the vast tablecloth at an al fresco party, the glances are severe. No sexy dancing either. In a way, despite the faux gaiety, it's something like living in a prison, especially for women.We're supposed to feel sorry for Michael who, at the end, is seen sitting alone in solemn grandeur, emotionally bankrupt. But Michael is really a rat who deserves everyone's contempt and execution by the state. It doesn't matter that he's young, handsome, well-spoken, powerful and rich. He's broken more laws than anyone can count. He lies, cheats, and murders at will. Those murders include an innocent whore who is horribly butchered simply in order to entrap the Senator from Nevada in Michael's thrall. He betrays his friends. He throws out his wife and prevents her from taking 'his' children. He murders his own brother for a past mistake for which he's already been punished.The original Don Corleone, Marlon Brando, had a set of allegiances extending outward from the family at its center -- to his ethnic group, his neighborhood, his co-conspirators in the business, and beyond that to some vague construct called 'the nation.' Al Pacino's Don has whittled it all down. At the center is ego, and beyond that, business. He's become a classical villain, a Richard III who has plucked down that crown, and if he now has buyer's remorse -- well, he should have thought things out earlier. His tragedy is nothing compared to mine, which has been Shakespearean in its grandeur, really. In my adolescence, the love of my life, Juliet, poisoned herself. And when, in all modesty, I tried to become Emperor of Rome, the treacherous bastards assassinated me.",8,1,4,25 May 2009
The Bourne Ultimatum," The Dregs.
","Great cast -- Matt Damon, Scott Glenn, Joan Allen, David Strathairn -- wasted in this commercial piece of egregious offal.The original in this franchise, 'The Bourne Identity', was a fascinating and brutal action movie with a genuine engine behind the plot. Just who IS Jason Bourne? Well, as it turns out, Bourne (Damon) is a failed CIA assassin who, having failed in an illegal enterprise and having become an amnesic, is a loose cannon that the CIA must destroy. (It's not the CIA, of course. It's some internal cabal. It's the INS or the IRS or the ABC or CNN or STD.) Lots of high-tech stuff and a good deal of splendidly realized action. Damon not only escapes from the agents of his former employer, he solves the question that has driven him.The sequel, 'The Bourne Supremacy', was a partial-birth abortion not only written to cash in on the commercial success of the original but directed in an unspeakably ill-conceived manner.This one is, if possible, worse than the previous installment. The MGM is still trying to kill Matt Damon but for no good reason. 'As far as I'm concerned, he's still a risk,' intones Scott Glenn, bad guy. There have been a hundred movies in the past two decades in which an entire regiment of evildoers pursues one action superhero who outwits and out-muscles them at every turn. Everybody has seen one or another version of 'Rambo'.This is an insult to the presumed intelligence of the American people. Near the beginning, there is a wide-angled aerial shot of the Arch of Triumph in the center of Paris, one of the city's three or four immediately recognizable landmarks. Then a caption inform us of the location -- 'Paris.' Not only that, but 'Paris, France.' Just so you don't get confused and think it's a postcard of Paris, New Jersey, or Las Vegas (NEVADA).There is a superabundance of action. People beat the crap out of one another. If that's what you're looking for, you'll find it here, pointless though it is. The score, however, is a copy of the effective original.I can't for the life of me understand why the director decided to follow the model set by the sequel, instead of that of the original, which was better in all respects.Every shot in 'The Bourne Ultimatum' seems to use a hand-held camera. And the camera wobbles all over the place as if held by a man suffering from a volcanic hangover. When Bourne first meets a possible friend in a café, near the opening, the shots are done in reverse angle, meaning when Damon speaks we watch him over the other guy's shoulder, and when the other guy speaks we look over Damon's shoulder. But here the camera roves and meanders. I've seen more professional camera work in home videos by high school kids. At one point the image of the other speakers blocks out all of Damon's face but his nose and mouth. In a later shot, the camera sinks so low and moves so excessively laterally that, instead of an over-the-shoulder shot, the image we see is a behind-the-neck shot because Damon's face is entirely obscured. Let me repeat that. A conversation is taking place between two men and the screen is filled with the shivering image of the back of one of their heads. I mean that literally.I couldn't finish watching this. I was in fear for the well-being of my visual cortex, not to mention my frontal lobes. But the user ratings are high enough to suggest that this is satisfying somebody's appetite for something. I won't try to guess what appetite that is, but can I ask one question? Guys, did you see the original? You know, 'The Bourne Identity'?",2,6,9,6 September 2008
Fargo," Don't Forgo Fargo
","Boy, is this a good movie. In its bare bones it is a crime drama but the Coen brothers constantly undercut the seriousness with a quirky irony. The acting, the script, and the direction lift the movie light years above most of the movies of its decade.The performances, for instance, everyone speaks with what passes for an upper Midwestern accent, a very pronounced accent, let's say. So when characters are doing wicked things on screen, it's rather like watching people dressed in clown suits do nasty things. It's utterly impossible to take it very seriously -- only just seriously enough for us to feel sorry for the victims and to disapprove of the bad guys, but no more than that.Everyone except the two killers are forced by their culture to speak and act cheerfully. They never swear either. 'You're darn tootin',' they say. The casting couldn't be better, with Frances McDormand, Steve Buscemi, and Bill Macy outstanding.The script is likewise splendidly done. It's full of scenes that seem peripheral except that they add to our understanding of the characters and often lead to later payoffs. Without taking the space to describe them, I will simply mention the scene in the restaurant between MacDormand and her Japanese friend from high school. Why is it in there at all? (My God, those hotel restaurants are depressingly ugly.) Well -- among other things, such as establishing the kind of milieu these folks consider Ritzy, it tells us quite a bit about how MacDormand handles attempts to violate her inherent good nature. When the Japanese guy tries to sit next to her she tells him firmly that she'd prefer it if he sat across the table so that she can see him more easily. When he breaks down in tears she whispers that it's all okay. She is polite, a little distant without being unfriendly, completely practical, and absolutely iron bound in her values. Nobody is going to take advantage of or discompose this hyper pregnant babe. Further, this scene is a set up for a later one. After MacDormand learns that the Japanese guy has told her a gaggle of lies, she wakes up to the fact that, yes, people can tell untruths -- and she returns to interview Macy a second time. In another scene, when she's pressing one of the criminals during an interview, he excuses himself for a moment and she spots him taking off in his car. She exclaims, 'Oh, for Pete's sake, he's FLEEIN' THE INTERVIEW.' It's impossible to improve on a line like that, or on MacDormand's delivery of it.The third element of the film that makes it superior is the direction. The pauses come at the right times. A woman is sitting on her couch watching a soap opera on TV. Through the glass door of her apartment she sees a man approach. He's wearing a black ski mask and carrying a crowbar. He walks up to her door and shades his eyes while trying to peer inside. Now in an ordinary action movie, by this time the woman would be screeching and speeding down the hallway. Not here. The victim sits there staring at the intruder as he fiddles at the door, half horrified and half curious. 'Who is this guy? He's not the meter reader, is he?' Coen the director has an eye for the suggestive picturesque too. Bill Macy has asked his father-in-law for a large loan for some sure-fire business proposition, but Dad offers him only a finder's fee. We see Macy's deflated face as his disappointment sets in. Cut. Now we're looking at a white screen punctuated by four or five bare trees equidistant from one another, and there is a tiny car in the middle of the whiteness. Then Macy's tiny figure trudges into the bottom of the shot and we realize we're looking at a snow-filled parking lot with only one ordinary-sized car in the center of it.Wintery weather plays an important part in the movie. People die in it, drive off the road because of it, stand shivering in it. Two freezing people are conversing on the street while one shovels snow. The shoveler stops, gazes up at the sky, and remarks that it 'ought to be really cold tomorrow.' Cars and ambulances tend to drive in and out of white outs during blizzards and blowing snow. MacDormand is driving her murdering prisoner through a niveous white landscape in which nothing much is visible and she is mildly remonstrating with him, saying something like, 'Why did you do it, for a little bit of money? It's a perfect day, and here you are.' (A perfect day!) There are seven murders in this movie. Only three take place on screen. The others either take place off screen or else the director has the good sense to cut at the moment the gun fires or the ax blade lands.'Fargo' is one of perhaps half a dozen movies from the 1990s that I would consider buying on DVD. It's an original and refreshingly adult picture. Don't miss it.",10,200,246,4 February 2005
Rush," Adrenalin Addicts.
","This may be Ron Howard's best film. It's certainly his most adult. Usually, Howard's work is cunningly commercial. No smoking on the screen because we don't want to set a bad example and somebody in the audience might be offended. Internal demons are overcome. Happy endings follow.'Rush' is a lot more textured than that, and Howard's directorial devices are muted but effective. Not a lot of time is given over to off-track romances. A couple meet and spend a few minutes together, then there is a cut to their marriage, sparing the viewer the agony of indecision and uncertainty and sobs. That comes later, but again it's just as quickly over with. And there are surprising grace notes. Before a more than usually dangerous race, there is the brief silhouette of a particularly venomous looking spider crawling in that deliberate spiderly way down a vertical surface. Just a second or two. More would have cheapened the shot. Less would have shrieked 'egomania'.The tale, of course, is based on a true 1976b story of rivalry between two Formula I racing car drivers -- Chris Hemsworth, an English playboy with long blond hair, and Daniel Brühl, an ambitious Austrian with a face like a garden gnome.Immediately, we like Hemsworth and dislike Brühl. Hemsworth is more handsome and has a more immediately appealing personality. It's a tribute to the director and the writer, Peter Morgan, that over time, as we get to understand both men better, they cross the finish line in a tie.The racing scenes are kept within bounds, sometimes skipped entirely and announced on TV or read about in a newspaper. The balance is just about right. And so is the explicitness of Brühl's injuries and the pain of his recovery. They aren't dwelt on or milked for a cheap gush of sympathy.The two women mainly involved with Hemsworth and Brühl need to be mentioned. Olivia Wilde is stunning in a felinesque way. Her birth surname is Cockburn and the family includes a number of well-known journalists and diplomats. She has dual citizenship with the US and Ireland, which perhaps explains why she is able to pull off her Brit accent with such conviction. She's the model who marries Hemsworth and divorces him to run off with Richard Burton.Alexandra Maria Lara meets Brühl by accident and they're quickly married. She's extraordinarily beautiful but in a quite different way from Wilde. Wilde radiates sexuality. She might consume you. But Lara, both in appearance and demeanor, suggests a gentler kind of love, quieter, less demonstrative, less feral, more nurturing. The women match the men they marry very well.It's a well done picture, not part of the usual Hollywood effluvium.",7,1,1,11 November 2014
Predator," Combat, mano a pseudopod.
","As action flicks go, this one's pretty typical. Arnold leads the usual band of expert musclemen into some tropical country on a mercy mission, or was it a mercenary mission, picks up a pretty young Latina (Elpidia Carillo) after a furious battle with well-armed swarthy guerrillas who make easy targets, and encounters a -- well, an alien, while on his way back to meet the chopper at the rendezvous.As Arnold pointed out at the time of release, you really get two movies for one. A regular excursion action flick and a science-fiction action flick.Boy, are these guys macho. (One of them is one of those North American Indians with an intuitive, spiritual collective unconscious who senses when the thing is nearby.) And they carry the ugliest guns ever seen on screen.It's the kind of 'lost patrol' movie in which the characters get picked off one by one by an unseen enemy until, in this example, only Arnold and Carillo are left alive to hop on the chopper. The major difference between most examples of the genre and this one is that the other examples ordinarily take breathers and give the characters a chance to chat, so we get to know them a little. Not much time for that here. A coffee break would mean one less opportunity for the group to shred the banana plants with their slugs and grenades.The alien gave me a bit of a problem, I have to say. Here he is, all decked out in high-tech equipment including a helmet that gives his vision infra-red capabilities. (He presses Arnold's head up against a tree and examines it carefully through this heat-registering device and you can tell what great shape Arnold is in because his nose is cold.) He's also got some kind of rocket launchers built into his arms and carries some strap ons that enable him to heal quickly or, failing that, to set off an atomic explosion.All of that high-tech stuff didn't bother me. But his organic evolution hasn't seem to have kept up with his technology. Okay, he's got opposable thumbs. Thank heaven for small favors. And he's bipedal. But that's about it. How do you design and build delicate equipment like that when your fingers end in claws? And when he removes his helmet we see that his mouth is surrounded by four maxillapods, crab-like claws that can serve no other purpose than to shovel food into his diminutive mouth. They've invented space travel but not the fork? Finally, his hair is made up into dreadful dreadlocks, which looks pretty retro from our perspective.What's this alien doing here anyway? 'He comes when the summer is hot,' Elpidia intones. (A sissy after all.) He seems to be a trophy hunter. He skins the people he kills but then seems to do nothing with the body except burn it so he can add the skull to his collection. He fawns proudly over those skulls.Does he show any other values aside from the desire to kill other living beings and preserve their heads as trophies? What I mean is, does he have any NON-HUMAN traits? Well, actually no. While they are being pursued, Elpidia drops a weapon and Arnold stops her and says, 'No! He didn't gill you befawh because you vair unahmed.' Later on, though, he shows no such compunction about deciding to kill a wounded and unarmed Arnold. Then, too, when challenged directly by Arnold at the end, the alien unburdens himself of his technological accoutrements and faces Arnold hand to hand, raising the question of whether they have Roy Rogers movies on the place from whence the alien came.If you're a fan of action movies, Arnold, earth-bound science fiction, or any combination thereof, catch this one if you haven't seen it yet.",5,4,18,25 June 2005
Notting Hill," Er, This Is So, Um, So Awkward Really That, Well -- It's Surreal.
","You have never seen such realistic portrayals of awkwardness, nor so many of them. Hugh Grant runs a humble bookshop in the little urban village of Notting Hill and one day a glamorous movie star, Julia Roberts, enters the store and pokes around. He doesn't recognize her but he kind of, well, likes her. On his way home to his humble flat and his skinny and nearly insane flat mate he bumps into her again, spilling something all over her shirt. With abundant apologies he invites her in so that she can clean up. She does so. And as she leaves his flat she unexpectedly leans forward and gives him a great big smooch, leaving poor Hugh Grant dumbfounded.He later makes a date with her but shows up while her interviews with reporters is still going on. He must pose as a writer from Horse and Hounds magazine and ask her silly questions like did she use horses in her last movie. ('It took place in outer space.') But mistaken identities are a staple of successful romantic comedies and of comedies in general. They were probably staples when Aristophanes used them. And that's what this is, a traditional romantic comedy, with three ups and two downs.What makes this different is the understatement and unease in the budding relationship. Nobody is better at discomfiture than Hugh Grant. Hugh is as good as Cary, better maybe. Some of the other staples I could have done without -- Hugh's eccentric but warm family, a near-slapstick ending, the soggy music. (A melancholy rendition of 'Love Makes the World Go Round' when Hugh seems to have lost Roberts and is moping around.) It's a colorful comedy though and I enjoyed it. There are just enough touches of realistic diffidence to tickle the heart of anyone who was once swamped with the neuropeptides of true love and then lost it.",6,0,1,13 November 2017
The Aviator," Surly Bonds.
","Lots of computer-generated images in this story of Howard Hughes' career as aviator, businessman, movie make, and heterosexual. I'm pretty sick of CGIs. In this instance, though, I applaud Martin Scorsese's prudent use of them. This isn't a simple and dumb story on which CGIs are hung. That is, the story isn't an excuse for airplanes to dive nose first into the camera or for ten-story-tall gorillas to go ice skating in Central Park. They're used when necessary to advance the exploration of Hughes' character and don't draw attention to themselves. Their impact is more dramatic. That crash of Hughes' experimental reconnaissance airplane with the twin booms is enough to swear anyone off flying for a while.Hughes himself -- it would be understating the fact to call him eccentric. I did part of a dissertation on Howard Hughes, based on the popular literature available at the time, and the guy we see on screen here is a lot worse off than I was led to believe. What seemed years ago as just the self indulgence of a very rich man now begins to look like the most flagrant form of obsessive-compulsive disorder with paranoid features. He wound up ensconced in a Mexican hotel suite surrounded and guarded and tended by Mormon myrmidons wearing surgical gloves. Everything became static. He watched the same movie ('Ice Station Zebra') over and over and over, to the point at which his servants, hearing the bombastic score begin behind the opening credits, sank their faces in their hands. He died of kidney shut-down in mid air without a peep.As a younger man he was far more thumotic. He moved around, spoke to strangers, manipulated women, designed airplanes, spent money recklessly, leaving the business end of things to Noah Dietrich. When Dietrich brought up some financial details, Hughes once waved him away, saying, 'You go down there and do what you want to do.' We get to see quite a lot of the younger, more spirited Hughes. Well, maybe not 'spiritied' but less stifled. It makes for a more lively movie. It's not merely a caricature of a guy who descended into a disabling mental illness. What would have happened to him if he'd been born poor, instead of heir to a cash cow? He'd have ended up in one of those psychiatric warehouses of the time.The supporting cast sports some pretty good performances. Cate Blanchett is a marvelous actress and she has Katherine Hepburn's mannerisms down pat, though she looks nothing like the original. The dinner scene with Hepburn's family at their estate in Connecticut tells us about all we need to know about why they are never going to make it. Hughes was a self-educated, obsessive-compulsive Texan, with little curiosity about the world outside of his own keenly focused interests. The Hepburn family reflected a sort of 'liberal arts' view of life, which is presented as elitist here. And it WAS elitist. But our sympathy for Hughes in this scene doesn't make him any more of a model of populism.There were some problems with Leonard DiCaprio as Hughes. The main difficulty that I had is one that shouldn't matter but did. DiCaprio adopts a Southern accent but that's about the only resemblance to Hughes. Hughes was extremely tall, a real leptosome, spoke in a slow, smooth, sometimes passionate, Southern drawl. DiCaprio's voice is cracked and quick. And he's short. Tommy Lee Jones gave a more convincing performance in a TV miniseries, even if it was less attention-grabbing.Nice job of illustrating the relationship between Hughes, on the one hand, and Alec Baldwin's Juan Trippe, who ran both Pan American Airways and an important senator from Maine. Trippe comes off as a master manipulator who systematically eliminated Pan Am's competition. Judging from casual outside reading I've done, this seems to be a widely shared view of Pan Am during the post-war years. The goal of a powerful corporation isn't to encourage competition but to establish a legitimate monopoly and establish a wide moat.In the end, you can't help feeling sympathy for Hughes, the poor little rich boy who ends the story a little like Citizen Kane, monarch of all he surveys, and with no friends.",7,0,1,18 January 2011
Léon: The Professional," Smart Kid.
","Natalie Portman, at twelve, is a smart, street-wise kid living in an shabby walk-up apartment with a dysfunctional family. Returning from an innocent trip to the grocery she finds that Gary Oldman and his goons have killed her entire family and are rummaging around, looking for some lost dope.Being a smart kid, Portman slowly carries her grocery bags past the open door to the blood-spattered room, past Oldman's lookout man who eyes her suspiciously, and when she reaches the end of the hallway, unable to walk farther, she presses the last doorbell. It doesn't open. The lookout is watching, his pistol in hand. She rings the bell again, whispering, 'Please open it.' Behind Door Number N is Jean Reno, a professional hit man, also with a drawn pistol, watching the goings on through a hole in the door. He works alone, 'no women, no kids', doesn't want to be involved in somebody else's violence, and he knows the girl's situation.He opens the door and for him it's like opening Pandora's box. All sorts of irrelevant demands are placed on him and he's subject to threats that have nothing to do with his profession.Oldman discovers that Portman was missed in the slaughter and the gang begins its search for her and, ultimately, for him too. Portman smokes cigarettes, is cheeky, wants to learn how to kill people, and whispers to the manager of their new hotel that Reno is not really her father. He's her lover.The manager's expression is a little hard to read. Natalie Portman may be an underdeveloped twelve but she is angelic with her Louise Brooks hair cut and her black choker and her feline eyes and her plump lips. She's not the most convincing little actress in the business but what does it matter? Any normal man would be abnormal if he didn't want to squeeze and bite her.There is a shoot-out at the end or, maybe, a grenade-out would be better. It's not a very sophisticated movie and it doesn't demand much of the viewer. Lone gunman comes to love a little kid and sacrifices himself. And there are a couple of spots meant to be humorous that only sometimes hit the mark. Reno's imitation of John Wayne is superb.In fact, though, Reno is pretty good throughout. What an 'everyman' kind of face. It's in no way glamorized. He's balding and his chin is stubbled. He dresses like a hobo and looks as if he might smell like a goat.Gary Oldman is a good heavy too, but the movie makes a clear distinction between bad killer Oldman and good killer Reno, who has a soft spot in his heart for beautiful children, rather like Allan Ladd had his kitten in 'This Gun For Hire.' But Portman is cute and Reno is appealing. A divertimento.",6,7,13,17 October 2011
Oblivion," The Ethics Are Situational.
","This is one of those futuristic movies that always confuses me because memories have been manipulated, the past is a mystery, and just when the hero (Cruise) and the viewer think they have a handle on the plot it turns into one of those giant, lavender, plopping mud puddles at Yellowstone National Park. Where am I? The movie begins clearly enough. There has been a war that wiped out most of the people on Earth except those who have migrated to a colony elsewhere, one of Jupiter's moons or someplace. A few misguided enemy stragglers have been left behind on earth, hiding in holes, and must be eliminated -- casually, one by one -- by Tom Cruise.Cruise has nothing much to complain about. He lives in a spotless plastic penthouse on top of a promontory and although he doesn't seem to have an HD-TV with a wide, curving screen, or much of anything else in the way of cultural artifacts, no cooking utensils or anything, he's not exactly starved for company. He's in constant touch with home base by radio/TV. They give him occasional orders like, 'Scab found poking around at grid X plus 3. Eliminate.' Moreover, he has a house mate who handles all the communications and monitors Cruise's movements when he takes his helicopter out on a mission. She's skilled at her job. And, more important, compliant -- even eagerly compliant. And she's played by Zoë Bell, who is attractive, has these arresting Saurian eyes, and has done stunt work for people like Uma Thurman in real life. One can bet she brings new meaning to the concept of gymnastics.A nice, quiet, domestic life for Cruise -- and the work is pleasant, too, occasionally blowing up people or left-over robots. I kept waiting for 'Morning' from Peer Gynt Suite. His own robots zip around in the air and look like angry pool balls. They do the wet work. But everything is not what it seems. Is it ever? When you look in the mirror, maybe you THINK you're seeing yourself as you really are, but you're not. The left hand side of the REAL YOU is the right hand side of the image in the mirror. I have broadened this idea into an entire philosophy of existence and expect to publish it shortly in my next volume: 'The Reflective Universe.' The logic is not entirely my own. It owes a great deal to the German phenomenologist and onanist Martin Freidegger, and to my high school football coach. (Thanks, Butch.)Where was I? Anyway, the whole idyllic life is just a fantasy. The underground enemy is led by Morgan Freeman in black leather armor and shades. He and his acolytes live in a cave, so it's very dark. Then Olga Kurylenko enters the film and it brightens considerably. What a stunning babe. I am so glad the Cold War is over so she can be an unalloyed good person. Not only is she 'good' but she, too, is compliant, I suppose compelled by the sheer Tom Cruiseness of the hero. But that's okay because she's also very moral. Yes, despite the apparently illicit sexual congress. Because she's his wife -- That's about as far as medical ethics will allow me to go with the plot. Besides, by this time I was terribly confused and I don't know if I could describe it accurately. The climax is an extravaganza of special effects, and not bad, as these things go. Action aplenty. Those peed-off pool balls really get around and they're hard to knock down, even with what appears to be a quad mount of M-2 .50 caliber machine guns.It's interesting enough to hold your interest but I wish they'd stop messing around with dreams, memories, fantasies, brain transplants, and all that stuff. If anyone needs that kind of confusion they can always glance through 'Finnegans Wake' or something.",6,1,2,10 July 2014
Burn After Reading," Comedy of Errors.
","John Malkovich is a mid-level CIA bureaucrat who is fired for misbehavior. 'A DRINKING problem?,' he shouts wildly. 'You're a MORMON. Next to you we ALL have drinking problems!' Propelled by revenge he begins to write a tell-all memoir, saving it to disk. He loses the disk at a gym, Hardbodies, where it's found by the empty-headed employees Brad Pitt and Frances McDormand, who try to sell it to the Russians, who aren't interested in it because it's 'drivel.' McDormand meets womanizing ex-Secret Service agent, George Clooney, who is schtupping Malkovich's wife. The disk full of 'secret' information is forgotten about and there follow all sorts of permutations on misidentification, paranoia, murder, and confusion.Of these, the trump is confusion. The CIA is trying to keep track of all this but is constantly being surprised and left bemused by new and inexplicable coincidences. So is the viewer.The humor doesn't depend on the plot, which is nonsense, but on twists and inversions of the conventions of the spy movie, and maybe movies in general. It's a comedy with some very funny moments, and other moments that clunk like a fumbled bronze mallet. Example of funny moment.Brad Pitt wants to confront Malkovich and demand money for the lost disk, so he breaks into Malkovich's house. Malkovich himself is out, but his wife's lover, Clooney, comes in and makes himself at home while the terrified Pitt hides in a bedroom closet. Clooney comes upstairs to the bedroom, takes a shower, casually puts on a robe, whistling and singing to himself. Then he opens the closet door.We expect to find Pitt cowering behind the clothes. Instead, there he is, right up front, greeting Clooney with a silent grin full of glistening white teeth, as if he were selling magazines on the doorstep. We only see his face for an instant -- before Clooney makes a reflexive grab for his gun and blows Pitt's head off.That's one of the more amusing scenes.The performances are okay. Nobody flubs it and, in fact, Brad Pitt is outrageous in his enactment of a comic role. The direction itself has its smiles. I do wish more effort had gone into plotting a story that had more opportunities for laughs, that didn't depend so heavily on cute moments and characters with pointless quirks.",5,7,14,23 December 2009
The Bourne Identity," Rambo in the City.
","You remember, I'm sure, how John Rambo was a practically superhuman expert at surviving and killing in the forest? And he was hunted by a horde of ill-motivated nincompoops and outwitted all of them in the mountains of Washington? Well, 'The Bourne Identity' is like that, except that its setting is urban and its a far less stupid movie. It's an action move alright, but not a stupid one. You can tell it's an action movie because there is a speedy car chase through the streets of Paris, and because the hero can cause a fuel tank to explode simply by shooting at it with a shotgun. You can tell it's not stereotypical because there are a number of physical fights in which one or another participant's pistol is knocked out of his hand -- and in no case is there a shot of the gun skittering along the floor. And neither does the hero bump his head against an adversary's head in defiance of Newton's third law. Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) is hauled out of the sea with a bullet wound and amnesia. He spends the movie, along with the girl friend he acquires (Potente) trying to find out who he is, a 'born' identity, so to speak. Meanwhile he's being hunted in the most thorough and high-tech sort of way by the CIA, who was to whack him for having failed to complete a hit. They're afraid he'll spill the beans, you see, and of course the police are after him too for various infractions committed in the course of his quest.I quite liked the movie. The atmosphere of wintry Switzerland and Paris are nicely set up. Whew, it looks cold. The performances are fine, especially the two leads and Chris Cooper at the CIA honcho. Oh, I suppose we can all have doubts that the CIA are quite so good at what they do, but this story is fictional.The action scenes, mostly mano a mano, don't drag on. They happen suddenly and are lightning-fast. The script is literate in the sense that people do and say things that are believable. Potenta's voice is especially neat to listen to. Her German-tinted sarcasm is perfectly believable.Matt Damon, well, he looks perhaps a bit like a ex-preppy whose most violent endeavors involved a tennis ball but his performance is fine, as it usually is. And although Chris Cooper's part isn't overly large, I think it's one of his best roles. He has an amazing range considering what he brings with him -- from efficiently slimy here to gentle and sensitive in something like 'Lone Star.' And though the plot is propelled by a set of less than plausible propositions, compare it to 'Rambo,' in which everything hinges on the revenge motive (if that's what it is) of one big hulking brute of an irritable sheriff.It's a well-crafted action movie with no great ethical moral embedded in it. I hope not anyway. If there were a message it would have to be something like, 'Who are we, really?' That's pretty banal unless it's treated as an absurdity, as in Georg Buchner's 'Woyzeck,' in which, when the hero becomes conscious, he asks something like, 'Who am I? Where am I? Why am I?' I'm not sure why, on the DVD, the director keeps drawing our attention to the 'realism' of the script while, at one point, he tells us that nobody was shown smoking in the movie because he didn't want to provide bad role models for kids, even though the entire French crew had Gauloise stubs glued to their lips. What price political correctness?Technically I suppose this is what I'd call a 'latent status movie,' in which the hero has the status of a highly skilled craftsman but doesn't reveal it until circumstances force him to. Shane's latent status was that of a skilled gunslinger. Richard Kimball's was that of a doctor. This is a higher-order latent status movie in that, not only do his friends not know of Bourne's secret identity as a superb assassin, but Bourne has amnesia and doesn't know it himself. (Suppose, though, Bourne's secret identity turned out to be that of manager of a Sonic Drive-Thru in Amarillo or something?)This has nothing to do with the movie but there is a director's audio commentary on the DVD. I do wish directors would do more than tell us which scenes were shot on location and which on a sound stage, and stop telling us how incredible everyone was on the set. Why not point out goofs, weaknesses, and conflicts as well? They're equally interesting.I recommend it, and I recommend taking a second look at Franka Potente, a young German woman whose appearance would not pass muster next to Brittny Spears or Jessica Alba but who has an inner beauty as well as a hell of a lot more talent than most of today's tabloid heroines. She does have one major flaw -- her name. I keep getting it mixed up with Famke Janssen and Battleship Potemkin and Mandy Potamkin and Frankie Sinatra and the name of a Chevrolet dealership in New Jersey. She'll have to change it.",7,1,2,10 December 2006
The Killing Fields," Horrifying Story of War and Character.
","Sam Waterston is Sidney Schanberg, a reporter working for the New York Times in the midst of a civil war in Cambodia in the early 70s. His dedicated interpreter is Dith Pran. In and around the capital are a few dozen other reporters and diplomatic personnel, including photographers John Malkovich and Julian Sands. It's dangerous work.Briefly, the Khmer Rouge win the battle for the country. The Westerners, towards whom the rebels have no reason to feel grateful, are penned up in the French embassy and finally thrown out of Cambodia. The Cambodians who have been associated with the West are sent to forced labor camps. They include Dith Pran, who has elected to stay with Schanberg because 'I am a journalist too, Sidney.' Waterston, Malkovich, and Sands try desperately to forge a passport for Pran but the attempt fails.Pran is beaten and tortured and finally escapes from the camp, only to face even more appalling horrors on his trek to safety. Meanwhile, Schanberg collects prizes in New York while agonizing over Pran's incommunicado.It's an outstanding film in almost every way. Haing Ngor won an award for his performance as Dith Pran and, in fact, he's quite good, stoic and frightened at the same time. But the story is Schanberg's because he's the person who has something to learn -- and learns it.Waterston's handling of the Schanberg role is more than adequate. He's able to capture Schanberg's New England accent with no trouble. Waterston himself was born in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and was graduated from Yale. But he does more than just play with a regional accent.In the beginning, Shanberg treats Pran as a kind of lackey or gofer. The famous reporter for the fabled New York Times rushes from place to place, self absorbed, eager for the truth, while Pran is little more than an instrument to him. I'm surprised the movie is so candid about this.At one point, the Khmer Rouge are about to roll into the Phnom Penh and Schanberg and the other reporters have decided to stay and cover the problematic event. Schanberg, busy typing, interrupts himself long enough to tell Dith Pran that people will be killed -- a lot of people -- and tells him to decide on the spot whether he wants to stay or leave. Arrangements have been made for Pran's family to get out but Pran himself is torn between his family and his loyalty to his profession as a 'journalist', as well as his personal loyalty to Schanberg. He twists his hands and works his features for a second before deciding to remain behind. As a result, he is dropped into hell.That basically is the first half of the film. The second half gives us a few scenes of Schanberg in New York shredding himself with guilt. But the focus is on Dith Pran's journey through the killing fields of Cambodia. He undergoes unspeakable iniquities. I won't describe them but I can say that the movie treats them with as much discretion as they deserve. The film doesn't wallow in blood. The final scene is sentimental but very moving.Among its virtues we can say that the photography is unimpeachable, although what it sometimes shows us is revolting. The musical score by Mike Oldfield is appropriate and innovative. Especially effective is the percussive dissonance that accompanies the arrival of the last U. S. Marine helicopters that evacuate some of the refugees. Oldfield also gets the palm for introducing so many Americans to 'Nessun Dorma' from 'Turandot,' one of only a handful of arias that most of us will find familiar now. I can't say the same for John Lennon's 'Imagine' at the end. I thought it was spelling out the obvious and I felt my basilar membranes wince a little. There were a few crying babies too many as well. Roland Joffe should have had more respect for his audience.It's one of the most realistic movies about war than I can remember seeing, and not 'brutal' in the usual sense of squibs exploding and bodies falling in slow motion. It's not that stupid. Sherman said, 'War is all hell.' True enough, for civilians as well as troops.",8,2,2,10 May 2011
The Italian Job," Blisteringly Fast Caper Movie.
","This is one of those movies in which a car rarely starts from a standing position without burning rubber. And, as far as I could tell, there wasn't a single U turn in it. If the driver wants to reverse his direction, he (or she) simply spins it around in a sort of pivot. Not to give the driving team too much credit. The three principal cars are souped-up Mini Coopers of different colors and must be easier to pivot than, say, a greyhound bus or an earth mover.There's no need to spell out plot details. A team of half a dozen or so 'professionals' pull off a spectacular heist of some 35 million dollars in gold bullion in Venice, Italy. I believe Venice was chosen as the location because it gives the film makers a chance to shoot sizable speedboat violating all the traffic rules on the narrow canals of the city. The boats chase one another at high speed, upsetting gondolas, smashing fishing docks, shooting through the air over obstacles, sinking battleships, and whatnot. Except for the police boats that seem to run in circles, I couldn't figure out who was chasing whom or why. It hardly matters. The point is the chase per se.The professionals meet on some Alpine mountain top to savor their success, with their mentor, Donald Sutherland, presiding over the proceedings. The young leader is Mark Wahlberg. Lamentably, there is a traitor in their midst, the freaky looking, mustachioed Edward Norton. He kills Sutherland and does his best to knock off everyone else.But they outwit him and survive, tracking this new multimillionaire back to his sumptuous lair in Southern California, home to many sumptuous lairs. They recruit Charlize Theron, Sutherland's daughter and now a security expert, in their attempt to steal the gold back.Norton, being nobody's fool, twigs to the arrangement and tries to foil their plan. The plan, by the way, involves a good deal of that impossible high tech stuff that appears only in movies like this. Their computer expert hijacks -- is that the word? -- hijacks the entire traffic light system of Greater Los Angeles as well as the subway system. Not only didn't I realize that these things could be hacked, I didn't even know Los Angeles now has a subway system for the little people. All of this leads to another, even more monumental chase, with the Mini Coopers zipping around on streets, sidewalks, subway tracks, and the ever-popular Los Angeles River like three cockroaches, pursued by a black helicopter and some expendable motorcycles.The acting, what there is of it, isn't objectionable, except that when the good guys finally corner the villainous Edward Norton and confront him with their victory, they smirk abominably. That's the director's fault, not the actors'. And certainly not the actress's. Charlize Theron, former ballerina, is seen drilling a particularly difficult safe. She should feel at liberty to drill any of the many safes in my possession. I love ballerinas. Charlize, O moon of my delight, I'm easy to reach. I'm a dancer too. I was once seen doing the froog. And I'm deliciously witty and gay, especially drunk. And my Mom and Pop have been known to kvell over my impression of Kirk Douglas.I will happily grovel before you and will ask only this in return: Try in the future to appear in movies in which the pattern exhaustion isn't so evident. Thank you, dear.",6,0,1,10 November 2010
Man of Steel," It's a Bird; It's a Plane; It's a -- No, It's a Bird.
","Lots of recognizable names in the cast as well as a couple of talented newcomers, and the story is complex, with several somewhat confusing flashbacks. But at heart it's just the old story, reminiscent of one of the later sequels to the original 'Superman' of 1978, with Christopher Reeves, plus a stylish and cadaverous green pallet and an absolute cornucopia of computer-generated graphics, with added hints of 'The War of the Worlds' and 'Mars Attacks.' Cavill is the alien from Krypton who is adopted by a farming family in Kansas and must hide his latent status because, as the editor of the Daily Planet, Laurence Fishburne, puts it, it would start a panic if people knew. He communicates this in a hushed voice to Lois Lane, Amy Adams, whose presence is appealing.I would have killed to see this movie if it had been available when I was a child, during the comic book age. Now it all seems to much and too little at the same time. Too little depth but so much action that it set my nerves on edge and I had to dash for the scotch. The action -- the visual f/x in general -- aren't deliberately paced. They come at you in bundles. WHAM! BANG! Bodies are flung around at the speed of light with abandon. The attacking Weasels of the US Air Force ought to know better than to try destroying an alien space craft on a small town street. Haven't the authorities ever seen a science fiction movie? The armed forces always lose. Except in 'Tarantula', in which Clint Eastwood manages to set afire a spider the size of Greenland. A disgusting sight. But just try something like that with Gort -- or with these evil-intioned goons.Everyone is either good or bad, as in a comic book, and sometimes that's fun, as in 'Indiana Jones' or the original 'Cape Fear.' Just sit back and let it wash over you. But the sort of things on screen here -- the tornadoes, the cars flung through the air, the anti-gravity machine turning Metropolis into a black hole -- have all been done before, and the people of the city running in panic from the massive cloud of dust raised by a collapsing building is genuinely tasteless.On the other hand, reducing the broth, if you enjoy a bonanza of destruction and fist fights and so on, this is your movie. I outgrew it about the time I lost my sense of the absurd.",6,3,7,5 April 2014
The Caine Mutiny," Novel Film
","There have already been almost 30 comments on this film and I agree with most of the points made, so I'd like to say a few things about the translation of Wouk's novel in film. The comparison sheds some light on what some people have seen as weaknesses in the film, and it brings up I think the problem that some strong points in the novel are lacking in the movie. First, the novel is big and fat, but it is Wouk's best if only because it has a tense, nicely honed narrative and is in fact a rattling good tale. It's a fine novel in many respects. The bonds between Willie and May, and between Willie and his mother, belongs. They provide a kind of parallel to his character's maturing aboard ship. Unfortunately, the main narrative of the film needs to be so condensed already that his romances should have been left out. The movie needed to be longer, I'm afraid, even without the 1950s love interest. What emerges gradually in the novel is thrust in our faces in the film in order to pack as much action and drama into the visuals as possible. The episode in which Queeg's cowardice becomes apparent, instead of involving an engagement between the Caine and a single shore battery, has the ship plowing through a forest of spouting explosions. We've seen it before. And the typhoon, when it comes, doesn't build in intensity; it's suddenly there on screen, hitting like a sledgehammer. It's not the fault of the screenwriters. They've done a good job of investing the residual lines with meaning, and even provide a new one that perhaps should have been in the novel: when Queeg is introducing himself to his wardroom he makes the remark that, 'The way those subs ganged up on us, I thought they had it in for me personally.' Neat! The novel also has a long introductory section on Willie at midshipman school which was properly left out. (As it was left out of the Reader's Digest condensation.) Wouk's book has little in it about anti-Semitism in the Navy, except to say that when it occurs, it's overridden by the anti-Semite's sense of fairness. The speech about Judaism given by Greenwald at the party reflects his own worries. He's railing against Hitler, not the Navy. Wouk's book reflects a patronizing attitude towards the crew, who are uniformly small minded and mostly dumb, and who are variously derided repeatedly as 'animals' or 'admired for the pure morning light that is in them,' which only tells us that Wouk found nothing to admire in them or he wouldn't have resorted to such junk. Mercifully, this class snobbery is barely apparent in the film. A few more irresistible points. All the characters are too old for their parts. And, if they had to use the romantic subplot, where in God's name did they find Robert Francis and 'May Wynn'? (That name, by the way, was already too top-heavy with symbolism.) Willie is a pivotal character in the book, if not in the film, and poor Robert Francis looks like a pug-nosed spoiled kid at the beginning, where it may be appropriate, and also at the end, where it's not. At no place in the film does he do anything that resembles acting. The final exchange between Greenwald and Bogart is fine except that it comes and goes too quickly. The disintegration in the novel, a result of the traps laid by Greenwald, seems a sudden and hardly motivated fracture in the movie. The first captain, Tom Tully, is described in the book as having 'a voice filled with irony and authority.' Tully, whom I've often admired, reduces this complexity to simple sarcasm and contempt. Maybe he didn't have time to do more. And Greenwald in the novel is given a shambling, almost shy demeanor, like Lieutenant Columbo, completely at odds with his courtroom cleverness, so that his forceful questioning comes as a shocking surprise. Jose Ferrer misses this and comes across as consistently sharp and resolute. I enjoy this film each time I see it. Yet, one look at the relatively new destroyer that poses as the Caine and one yearns for the broken-down World War I hulk of a converted minesweeper that was the Caine in the novel. Someday, someone might make a truly great film out of this finely written novel. They keep remaking classics that don't need improvement. Here's one that could use some updating. Imagine that climactic typhoon with CGI.",Null,1,4,29 September 2001
28 Weeks Later," Type: B Negative.
","I don't think this is worth more than a few words. A plague has killed or exiled the residents of London and the US Army, the world's epidemiologist, is now patrolling the city as exiled are re-introduced in small batches.Among them is a hapless father who has lost his wife and his two lonely children, just returned from exile in Spain. A kind of Army hostess greets them at the equivalent of Ellis Island on the Isle of Dogs. The island is completely safe, she tells them in a soothing voice. Just be sure you don't leave it or you might encounter a contaminated object or a survivor. In this kind of movie, when a warning like that is issued, you become prescient.The two kids promptly leave the Isle of Dogs looking for what was once their home and, with luck, a photo of their mother. They do better than that. They find mother herself, an asymptomatic contagious survivor. The Army finds the three of them and takes them back to the isolated Isle, where the next stupid act comes from the woman's husband. He can't stand to be without her. The sanctuary apparently has no control officers or guards because the husband waltzes blithely through the many doors, kisses his wife, who is under restraint, then becomes infected at once, goes berserk, bangs his head against the walls, screams, has an epileptiform seizure, spurts blood from every orifice, and attacks his helpless wife, gouging our her eyeballs with his fingers, battering her face into pulp.It's a shame that it so quickly deteriorated into a more than usually violent bath tub full of gore and violence because the premise has promise. The disease being dealt with has symptoms similar to those of ebola, except for the superhuman strength and madness that movies must tack on for greater impact.The locations are surprisingly good. London has changed a lot since I was last there. But the photography is fashionably dark. I have no idea how this fad got started, perhaps with 'The X Files,' but every scene is underlighted. Even a hospital is dark during hours. It doesn't enhance the sense of mystery or threat. It only irritates you and makes you wonder what the hell is going on. And the fashionably wobbling camera is enough to make you spurt blood from every orifice.The early scenes with the soldiers jerking around with one another are kind of fun, although even here cheap shots at shock are taken. (Eg., a pilot is dozing off and there is a loud noise and he is attacked from someone off screen -- but it's just a buddy playing grabass. It happens twice, as if once weren't too much.) Aside from those opening scenes, what the film has going for it is Imogen Poots as the daughter. She has a nose on her that seems sculpted out of one of those plastic French curves used by school children. She's stunning. Her beauty is strictly conventional but undeniable. But -- Imogen Poots? And her close friend is supposed to be Mathew Beard? Where do the Brits get these names from? I mean, Micawber or Bumble, okay. But Poots and Beard? It sounds like a Monty Python sketch. Poots and Beard present: 'YOU'LL NEVER BELIEVE IT!', A Zany Laff Riot That Will Jar Loose Your Dental Plate!!!",3,1,5,3 October 2014
He Got Game," All over the court but sometimes compelling.
","The director, Spike Lee, has got talent. No question about it. He stylizes the film with momentary flashbacks and slow motion -- but just enough. Not so much as to interfere with the narrative or attract attention to the director. And the photography, as is usual in his films, is truly splendid. Coney Island never looked quite so inviting, at least not for the last fifty years or so.The story -- the best high school basketball player being tempted with all sorts of material benefits to sign up for prestigious schools -- gives Lee a chance to indulge his fascination with basketball. I must admit that basketball never fascinated me. When I was a kid there was nothing but baseball. But, now, it seems that instant gratification trumps patience. Who wants to wait for the pitcher to dig his cleated shoe into the mound, remove his hat and wipe the sweat from his brow, acknowledge signals from the catcher, glance at first base, the wind up, the pitch, the call -- yawn. Basketball is all motion by regulation.Still, 'White Men Can't Jump' was a pretty good movie about basketball. And 'He Got Game' doesn't have that much basketball in it, and nothing at all that's technical. It's chiefly a story of Ray Allen, who must choose a lesser school or see his father (Denzel Washington) go back to Attica. And it's the story of the relationship between Washington, who accidentally offed his wife, and Allen, who despises his father. There isn't really a boring moment in it, although, to be sure, it wanders all over the place and explores, however briefly and unsatisfactorily, a number of issues and the conflicts they generate.Lee has chosen to use Aaron Copeland's music to provide a symphonic score that is curiously at odds with the lives we're watching. The visuals get down on their knees and sob for hip hop. Yet the score is appropriate because it helps to universalize a story that otherwise might seem locked into too narrow a cultural setting.Ray Allen, sports figure, can't act very well. He's an object of envy anyway. Full of principle, for one thing. Old Denzel's future would have been lost the moment that Italian salesman offered me the two-million dollar platinum watch. Also, is there a greater imaginable thrill on Planet Earth than getting it on with Rosario Dawson while in the cage of one of those giant swings in the amusement park? Denzel Washington gives one of his best performances and the others are easily up to par, especially Bill Nunn as Allen's new Dad who is unable to see any future that doesn't include diamond pinkie rings and a new Lexus. He's hilarious.I've always been chary of Spike Lee since 'Do the Right Thing,' which closes with admonishments from Martin Luther King, Jr., and Malcom X -- in that climactic order. The last words were 'by any means necessary.' When the goal to be achieved is something as vague and general as 'freedom' or 'democracy', using any means you consider necessary can get you into trouble. Instead of achieving freedom you're liable to achieve jail, and instead of achieving democracy you're liable to achieve a somebody else's civil war. There are sentiments that belong on bumper stickers and nowhere else.However, Lee's films generally have been far from rabble rousers, and 'He Got Game' is no exception. It's a well-done drama with a couple of clunkers in it. (A magic basketball sails all the way from Attica's exercise yard to the court at Big State University.) The whole thing, weaknesses notwithstanding, is odd but gripping. We really DO want to see how it turns out.",6,1,3,12 July 2007
Trouble with the Curve," What is past, or passing, or to come.
","It's a movie about Clint Eastwood, baseball scout for one of the major league teams, sent to North Carolina to bid competitively for the services of an arrogant young slugger. He's joined by his estranged daughter, Amy Adams, who grew up with baseball but has just been offered a partnership in her law firm back in Atlanta.Will the managers take Eastwood's advice to pass the slugger up, or will they go with the statistics and hire him? Eastwood is going blind and can hardly read his own name, but his knowledgeable daughter serves as his eyes. (Clintwood has his own ears and can use them instrumentally.) The firm wants her back in the city to make an important presentation to a client, and she's working her butt off to polish it up, but she feels that Dad needs her here in the sticks. Will she abrogate her professional responsibilities and see this conundrum through with Eastwood, who keeps telling her to beat it? It's all very tense.Eastwood's later work has always been leisurely and here it's even more so, with its focus on father and daughter, and baseball and jobs important subjects but minor. There are plenty of scenes in which people sit around and talk over bottles of beer. There really isn't much baseball involved, and practically nothing about the way a scout exercises his skills. Dad hates computers and all that robotical crap. He can tell whether a boy can hit from the way the ball sounds when it whops into the catcher's glove. But how he does it, how he can tell, remains a mystery.Amy Adams' performance isn't bad. She's kind of cute, with that upturned nose of hers. And she's of a proper age to play Eastwood's daughter, in her early thirties, a graduate of law school, and an established career. If she were ten years younger it would make us wonder about Eastwood, who has aged quite a bit in the past few years, since, say, 'The Changeling.' It's not just that he LOOKS older. His voice has been reduced from an aging gargle to a hoarse whisper. It's depressing to see him soldiering on and yet it evokes our sympathy for the character -- and for Eastwood. 'An aged man is but a paltry thing, A tattered coat upon a stick, unless Soul clap its hands and sing, and louder sing For every tatter in its mortal dress.' Eastwood handles the role as an angry egotist in professional decline, but it's quietly moving. It's not a great movie, not exceptionally good, but, in a way, it doesn't have to be.",6,1,2,27 June 2013
Bridge of Spies," Two For One.
","In the early 50s, the quiet, middle-aged amateur artist, Walter Abel is arrested. He's a Soviet spy. Tom Hanks is appointed to defend him but it's all supposed to be pro forma. Hanks is supposed to wave the fourth amendment, mention due process and protection from search and seizure, then sit down and shut up. But he takes his job as defense counsel seriously and nobody likes it. He can't possibly get Abel off but still he's defending a Russky espionage agent. Everyone is anxious to see this guy get the chair. It was disheartening to see that the director has Hanks sitting on a subway at this point while all the strap hangers are reading about the trial in the newspapers and glare at him. The reason it's disheartening is that such a scene surely never happened in real life. Who the hell knows what Abel's defense attorney looked like -- or if they had seen photos of him, would recognize the innocent Hanks sitting on a subway train. And another reason that it's disheartening is that the director doesn't trust the audience to know what's already been made clear -- Hanks is ill thought of because he's defending a hated enemy. Really, earlier scenes in court and at Hanks' home have made that very clear.The judge is eager to hang Abel too, but Hanks, an insurance lawyer, visits the judge at home and points out that if Abel is put in prison instead of the graveyard, the U. S. will have a little something in its back pocket to trade in case something similar happens to one of our agents in Moscow. Just in case, you know, kind of like an insurance policy. The judge is convinced and Abel gets thirty years, much to the anger of the public at large. While the two sit quietly in the visiting room listening to Shostakovitch, Able remarks, not unkindly, that Hanks 'should be careful', and in fact a couple of bullets are fired through the windows of his home. When he loses his appeal to the Supreme Court, it's back to the insurance business for Hanks. He's summarily snubbed.Meanwhile, however, there has been a parallel story. The CIA has developed the super-secret U-2, a spy plane whose service altitude is 70,000 feet. That's pretty high up, out of the range of known Soviet missiles. But then, as Leo Strauss has pointed out, there are 'unknown unknowns' and one of them is that Soviet missiles can bring down an airplane at 70,000 feet, which they duly do. The pilot, Francis Gary Powers, has been instructed to destroy both himself and the airplane if it should be brought down in Russian territory but he's unable to do either. The Soviets get both prizes and make the most of their exploit in the media, embarrassing president Dwight D. Eisenhower who at first claimed no knowledge of the spying. (This detail isn't in the movie.) Powers is tried and given ten years in a Soviet prison. Ugh.Hanks is given the job of arranging a prisoner exchange in East Berlin, all on his own. His mission is to trade Abel for Powers and another guy, Pryor, a graduate student from Yale who was detained for no particular reason. Again, it's not mentioned in the movie but John F. Kennedy was president at the time and Hanks' character had his full backing except that Kennedy, a Harvard man, said he 'wouldn't bust his *** getting a Yale man out.' The CIA cares nothing at all about Pryor. They only want to get Powers back, although they all hate him for having survived. The fact that Powers has suffered in an East German prison and kept awake for extended periods to squeeze information out of him means nothing to the CIA. In the end, due to Hanks' determination, the swap is accomplished after much bureaucratic haggling, and both Americans are released, while Abel is sent back to his family.Good stuff. Nice photography and visual f/x. The scene of Powers' U-2 being shot down is thrilling. Tom Hanks brings an unusual edginess to the role of the central figure. He's jumpy, nervous, speaks rapidly, paces. Think of Gregory Peck. Now think of the opposite, except for the concordant confidence. As James B. Donovan, Hanks has a wife and two lovely kiddies. The kids are a little cute, but Hanks' wife, Amy Ryan, is just about right. She's pretty without being Hollywood gorgeous. And she doesn't provide unconditional support, nor does she nag. Nice job of writing. The standout performance is by Mary Rylance as Rudolf Abel. Rylance gives us a wimpy little spy, wily, artistic, unflappable. He's taciturn and when he speaks it's with a Scottish accent and what he says is keenly perceptive. It's never slow because with the exception of Abel, all the character speak quickly, as in a thirty-second TV commercial. At time it felt as if the camera were undercranked.The director, Spielberg, could easily have ruined the film by turning Hanks into a brave and resolute hero instead of a guy who insists on playing by the rules, who is anxious to get home and go to bed, who is frightened when cornered by some German kids who demand his warm coat in the middle of winter. Abel could have been turned into a stereotypical Russian spy, bald, ugly, and snarling defiantly. Instead of being snubbed after his return, Francis Gary Powers might have been hailed as a proud representative of Uncle Sam and given a ticker tape parade. And so on until we're not watching an adult movie but a children's cartoon.",7,1,1,1 July 2016
The Hills Have Eyes," Nice idea. Movie: One long execution.
","Great location shooting -- a windswept old model town, right out of a Twilight Zone episode, that was used as an atomic testing site. I love it when naive characters wander around in a deserted little settlement, discovering the mannequins and other left-overs from the era of atomic testing. There's a certain thrill in it all, which might be called 'the last people on earth' arousal jag. The New Mexico desert is tinted a delicate yellow and is thoroughly windswept, inviting exploration. As a kid I spent a summer along with a handful of Coast Guardsmen at the closed Fort Hancock on Sandy Hook, New Jersey. The entire fort had been closed down and left exactly as it was except no locks on anything, like an empty movie set -- the mile long lines of barracks, the administration buildings, the hospital (with stained slides still lined up neatly on the shelves). It made your hair stand on end to wander at will through a community that was completely silent and empty. (Of course, now, anybody can do it by walking through downtown Los Angeles on a weekend.) I stumbled across a heap of discarded, live 20 millimeter cannon shells and, not realizing that live ammo of such age might be unstable, began juggling the things like a circus performer. That's kind of the story of this movie except the ammo assumes explosive human form. Five or six people in their trailer-towing van have a flat tire and wind up looking through the phony community they've discovered. It's an involving experience until the mutated zombies show up and then it turns into an unusually gory and revolting slash fest.What a wasted opportunity. What could have been a great Twilight Zone story becomes just another movie with angry, made-up, el freakos, trapping and killing half the visitors in the most repugnant fashion and the survivors retaliating in kind. The camera lingers with relish on one of the deformed creeps (they all look different except for their bad teeth) who has just had a wooden stake thrust into his belly. To the accompaniment of a sound like a glue pot, the creature looks down at the protruding handle, says, 'Huh?', and then pulls it out with what I think was intended to be an evil smile. You see, in order to really KILL the things, you have to do some REAL damage -- whack them through the head with an ax, jump off a cliff with them, blow them to smithereens in an explosion. The killings are not only an insult to the human body but to the human intelligence as well. (The escapees are literally drenched in blood by the end.) And yet that's what the movie is ABOUT.There's no attempt to reach the audience above the abdominal level. It has nothing to say about atomic bombs or the wonder of the exotic. It might as well be taking place with half a dozen kids trapped in a mausoleum full of ghouls, a variation on a theme that was old a long time ago, only this time around the special effects are excruciating.Of course it's always nice to see Kathleen Quinlan, but the acting here consists almost entirely of screams. And the young men, who ought to be able to take care of themselves, are incredibly stupid. One of them is being chased through the desert by a mutant who is equally light of foot. The kid is armed with an automatic. As he sprints and stumbles along he points the pistol behind him and fires wildly without looking until he empties his weapon. The viewer's heart races alarmingly.Maybe you'll enjoy seeing zombies/ghouls/rotting corpses/mutants slaughtering innocent people in the bloodiest way imaginable. It wasn't my kind of film. I thought it sucked. But -- if I can end on a constructive note -- for anyone who wants to see an ax murderer at work, almost equally bloody but amounting to far more than an upper-torso exercise, they might try 'The Weight of Water.' If you don't like challenges, of course, then skip it.",2,6,9,8 September 2007
Cold Mountain," War is all hell.
","There's a stunning scene towards the end when Jude Law approaches his long-lost girlfriend, Nicole Kidman, on a snowy path through what appears to be an archway of rock pinnacles all dusted with white. Law is hardly more than a scrawny black scarecrow in a slouch hat. Not recognizing him after a year's absence she fires two warning shots towards him. He is shaken and begins to turn away, thinking she's forgotten him, but then awareness comes to her and she calls out, 'Inman?' Now, what follows ought to be a slow-motion shot of the two figures running towards each other and weeping with joy. She runs and weeps and laughs in slow motion. He runs and weeps and laughs in slow motion. But, no. Minghella, the director, has Law and Kidman crunch towards one another cautiously, as if neither is entirely certain that what is happening is not an hallucination. And Minghella cuts away from the reunion after only a brief and tasteful moment.The movie is a series of rather loosely linked episodes, cutting back and forth between Law making his lonely and dangerous way back home from the battlefield, and Kidman who is about to starve on her wretched farm because, as a gentlewoman, she was taught only what was useless. She can name all the plants in Latin but she can't grow them. Renee Zellweger shows up at the opportune moment, a no-nonsense practical independent and blunt young woman who is able to show Kidman the ropes.The initial meeting between Law and Kidman only lasts for a few minutes, and they are together at the end just long enough for the anticipated climax, so to speak, but everything in between the beginning and the end kind of meanders about, like one of the ox bow lakes that Law must traverse during his journey. What the heck is going on?What seems to be going on is mostly two things. First, the movie gives us a pretty good ethnographic picture of the folks who lived in the Upland South in the 1860s. (Good production design and wardrobe.) There are no magnificent steps in the Big House for Bette Davis to trip down in a hoop skirt, just old weathered shacks whose shingles need replacing and whose corn cribs must be filled if the inhabitants are to survive the winter. Come to think of it, there are no hoop skirts at all. Everyone is dressed in more than usually drab garments, usually dirty. Even the women's underwear is yellow and blotched. The dialog isn't noticeably Upland South though. In the Lowland South, say around Charleston, 'sir' becomes 'suh,' but in the mountains it is 'sirr.' Not an important point.Because of their beards and raggedy clothing the men tend to look alike. They all look like Chuck Norris, unless they are older and look like James Gammon. In fact one of them IS James Gammon. Nicole Kidman's visage is as sleek as her figure. She could be the hood ornament on an old, ornate automobile.Some of the episodes are more interesting than others although it was never too difficult to figure out who would survive and who would die. Philip Seymour Hoffman as one of those pasquinades of pastoral piety is a riot. What music he lends his lines! And at one point Law is invited to spend the night in bed with Natalie Portman, her husband long dead, who writhes with grief, guilt, and horniness as she asks him to promise that if he lies down next to her he 'won't go no further.' Righto! It reminded me of a similar scene in which a lad was successfully tested in 'Tales of the Arabian Nights', to which the translator, Richard Burton, had added a rare footnote -- 'The young man must have been a demon of chastity.'I have a feeling there is a moral to this movie. The moral is that war should be entered into only as a last resort, but I'm not sure.",6,3,7,26 July 2005
American Psycho," If It's a Joke, It Got By Me.
","I didn't read the novel, only reviews of the novel, but I'm not sure that makes too much difference. A movie more or less stands on its own two feet. Or else it pretty much drops as dead as this one does.It has two very good features: (1) the performances, especially Christian Bale's as the homicidal loony, and (2) the art direction. You've never seen such opulence, spare and shiny and sterile.The problems lie with the script. It takes us through the days in the life of Patrick, who begins his mornings with some kind of horrifying bikini wax all over his face, then lounges around his office competing for nasty cracks with the rest of the boys, and ends up with mayhem of a particularly gory sort. I couldn't put the climactic reveal through any kind of step-down transducer that made sense. You mean 'it was all a dream'? I didn't find the blood sickening but found the characters and their values to be enough to gag a maggot -- excepting the winsome Chloe Sevigny and Willem DaFoe's affably ironic detective. The rest of them were about as appalling as the characters in 'Bonfire of the Vanities.' Who wants to sit through such a parade of narcissism for two hours? Don't we get enough of that from Washington? And this thing has been described as a comic/horror film. The phrase lends new meaning to the word 'comic'. What the hell is funny about it? Listening to Bateman's spiels about how deeply profound 1980s rock was? Is that funny? Or waltzing around in a plastic raincoat while preparing to chop a colleague into bits? Is THAT somehow amusing? Well. I'm kind of thinking it over and, yeah, I guess there is one comic element to the film. It's that it was taken seriously.There's a moral lesson here though. Please take this down. Yes, it will be on the exam. A slasher movie doesn't become a good feature film just because you've spent a lot of money on it and based it on a best-selling novel. Now pardon me while I go slit a vein.",3,12,26,14 May 2007
Little Miss Sunshine," Comedy has charm, humor, and is a commercial product.
","We are introduced to the Hoover family: the mother (Toni Collette), the achievement-obsessed father (Greg Kinnear), the vulgar grandfather (Alan Arkin), the depressed teen-aged son suffering from elective mutism (Paul Dano), the scholarly, gay uncle who is recovering from a suicide attempt (Steve Carrell), and the cutely plain little girl who wants to be a candidate for Little Miss Sunshine (Abigail Breslin).'A family of losers,' someone calls them. (Well, they are, after all, the Hoovers.) Actually, once we get the introductions over with, it isn't a promising picture. This is the way TV situation comedies are planned -- throw together a group of dissimilar nuts into one house and have them stumble all over each other while making wisecracks. If you try to stretch it out to feature length you're liable to wind up with Chevy Chase in a Griswold family vacation movie, with a dead body strapped to the roof. (This one has a dead body in the back of the VW microbus.) The little girl, Olive, wins a crack at the title of Little Miss Sunshine in Redondo Beach, California, an apt location, but the whole family must pile into the VW and drive the 800 miles from Albuquerque and must arrive the day after tomorrow by 3PM to register. All sorts of things go wrong that cause delays -- surprise! Not only does gramps die in his sleep, but the local hospital's 'bereavement counselor,' after offering them her condolences in a practiced voice, begins handing them thousands of pages of forms that have to be filled out. What's more, they can't just transport gramp's remains across the state line because that involves the personal endorsement of the Federal Trade Commission and would be a violation of the Mann Act. I just made that up, but I want to suggest that if the Hoover family follows the rules, Olive's entry in the contest is forfeit. So, the Little Miss Sunshine contest being of paramount importance, they don't follow the rules. Instead, they smuggle the remains out of a hospital window and stuff it into the back of the bus in a scene that lacks the laughs that the smuggling of a dead body ought to have.Actually, there aren't many laughs in the film, although it is replete with incidents that generate smiles. As in any successful sitcom, the characters' quirks are milked for all the laughs that can be gotten from them. At breakfast in a café, for instance, Olive orders waffles a la mode. Kinnear, his eye ever on the game, explains to her that ice cream is made from cream and that it has a lot of fat and that beauty contest winners are -- well, would you call them fat or skinny? Olive replies doubtfully, 'Skinny?' Kinnear smiles down at her. Smart kid.The beauty contest must have provided the writers with a challenge. The other contestants look like porcelain dolls. They are of various races but share bulbous foreheads, bouffant hair styles, lots of make up, great big false lashes, pasted-on smiles full of capped teeth, flashy outfits of sequins and bangles, and a way of prancing around on stage while shaking their little tushies, to the delight of a burly, bearded guy smothered in tattoos who appears to represent the pedophiles in our midst. Well, Olive is a nice kid, but she's no beauty and her talent is modest compared to the yodelers and the gymnasts.Does Olive win? It would defy our suspension of disbelief. Does she lose? What kind of happy ending would that be? So the writers plump for having her get on the stage in front of these professional stage mothers and do a kind of raucous strip tease, using some lascivious steps taught to her by her degraded grandfather. Some members of the audience get up and leave in disgust. They prefer a more disguised pornography. The bailiffs, or the guards, or the corrections officers, or the civilian contractors rush to remove Olive from the stage. BUT -- the whole family runs on the stage, beats off the agents of social control, and JOINS IN OLIVE'S DANCE! Not only do the concepts of 'winning' and 'losing' become irrelevant, but Olive has brought the whole family together again! Let's hear it for Olive! The movie has its moments of desperation. At one point, the horn of the VW begins bleating by itself. But on the whole there are enough laughs to keep a family entertained. The kids aren't likely to get the mostly unsuccessful gags about homosexuality (or maybe they will) and they'll surely miss the references to Proust and Nietzsche, but they'll appreciate gramp's filthy mouth and the sillier jokes. It ends on a warm, up-lifting note. I wish it had ended with a capper of a comedy caper.",6,0,0,1 January 2008
North by Northwest," Best in Show.
","A lot of directors have taken a crack at the comedy-laced thriller, among them, most notably, Alfred Hitchcock, but probably none have topped this for sheer entertainment value.Cary Grant is a stereotypical Madison Avenue advertising man in the 1950s, shallow and given to 'expedient exaggerations.' He's urban, well groomed, and tan as only Cary Grant can be tan. By accident, he is misidentified as George Kaplan, a non-existent government agent. He's kidnapped by foreign operatives who try to kill him. When he manages to escape he's framed for a murder. With the police after him, he boards a train for Chicago in pursuit of the real 'Kaplan', who of course is nothing more than a CIA-inspired fiction who occupies prop hotel rooms, wears prop clothes, and has prop dandruff. On the train he bumps into the savagely seductive Eva Marie Saint. This at least is no accident. She's a double agent, working for the suave spy, James Mason, and secretly for the CIA's Leo G. Carroll. The double pursuit -- the cops after Grant, Grant after 'Kaplan' -- becomes twisted and winds up on the faces of the four presidents at Mount Rushmore in South Dakota.At the exciting climax, Cary Grant has shed some of his callousness and has committed his love and his life to Eva Marie Saint. His monogrammed matchbooks, 'R.O.T.', standing for Roger Thornhill and also for 'rot' are no longer relevant.There are some splendid examples of black and white feature films. Who could improve on Gregg Toland's photography in 'Citizen Kane' or the striking and sinuous contrasts in 'The Maltese Falcon' or the bleak gaiety captured in 'La Dolce Vita'? But this one cries out for a big screen, color, and surround sound to accommodate composer Bernard Hermann's musical score, that opens and closes with a wild fandango.Okay. Visualize one of the sequences here, probably the best known. Kaplan has supposedly agreed to meet Grant at 'Prairie Stop, Indiana.' It's nothing more than a spot in the middle of a two-dimensionally flat wasteland -- no trees, no buildings, no hills, nothing but vast, tawny plowed plots and a parched cornfield nearby, all shimmering in the heat. Grant waits silently as the occasional car whizzes past. Nothing is happening. Then a man is dropped off across the highway. The two strangers are alone, staring at each other across the pavement. Minutes go by as they do nothing but stare, Grant puzzled ('Is this Kaplan?'), the other inexpressive. The other guy turns out to be a know-nothing local and after he departs on a bus, Grant is attacked by an airplane and barely escapes with his life. For the many people who have seen this sequence, let me ask them to imagine this shot in the traditional small screen ratio and done in black and white. It would lose half its impact.Some critics have, I think, over-interpreted the movie. I doubt that the title is taken from from Hamlet: 'I am but mad north-northwest: when the wind is southerly I know a hawk from a handsaw.' There's Grant's ambiguous relationship with his mother (a favorite Hitchcock theme in serious contexts), the wary love story, the development of Grant's character. But in this instance those features are trivialized. It's really a complicated, sublimely executed chase thriller at heart.Ernest Lehman's script includes many amusing incidents and some of them are very funny indeed. Not just snappy dialog -- 'Something wrong with your eyes, Mister?' 'Yes, they're sensitive to questions.' But whole scenes that are laugh-out-loud comic -- Grant making a fool of himself at a public auction in order to attract the attention of the police. (The scene was prefigured in the much earlier 'All Through the Night' and later imitated in 'The Prize.') The love affair between Grant and Saint begins with a dutiful seduction and ends with marriage -- too quickly, too jury-rigged, too required by the plot -- and some of the dialog between them is clumsy, but who cares? It's not art, but so little on the screen is. It's about as good an entertainment as you're likely to find, better than any of the chase thrillers coming out today. If I see another car chase that ends in an exploding fireball I'll write an angry OpEd piece for the New York Times.",9,1,4,1 May 2009
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," Snap, Crackle, Pop.
","If it's worth doing at all, it's worth doing to excess. That is, if you're making a sequel to a sequel, why not make it bigger and add more of whatever excited the kids in the first place? Only, of course, Arnold must be a good guy.'The Terminator' was kind of cute and fun, what with it's inventiveness, lack of preciosity, it's high-speed chases through night-time Los Angeles, and Arnold finally being turned into the robot he was always intended to be.This one sucks. The jokes aren't funny and they're self referential. The high-speed chases only pause for breath now and then. None of the characters convince, although Claire Danes is a decent actress with strong features a bit too fleshy to qualify as beautiful by Hollywood standards, one of the reasons I find her appealing. And, as I say, she can act too, as she did in Coppola's 'The Rain Maker.' But she has no more of a chance here than any of the other performers, maybe less because her character has been shoehorned into the plot.The explosions are bigger and better. And why not? As Mies Van Der Rohe said, 'More is more; and MORE is more and more.'",3,1,8,14 July 2015
Doctor Zhivago," A Farewell to Yuriatin.
","What a remarkable eye David Lean has for visual imagery. Two hundred years ago, without a camera, he might have been a painter. Not a Cezanne maybe but an Andrew Wyeth. Not much love but lots of precision. What a host of golden daffodils.Example: Omar Sheriff is Yuri Zhivago who has trekked miles across the windswept snows of Russia during the Civil War that followed the revolution. He's a deserter and all alone. He's been on his own for months. Finally he reaches the house of his erstwhile lover, Julie Christie. His eyes fill with tears as he surveys the bleak, empty apartment that he will call home, at least for a while.He stumbles exhausted into the bedroom, stares at the bed where he and Christie slept together long ago, then catches sight of himself in the mirror. He's a physical wreck. His face is an oily white, his facial hair a frozen muff. His clothes are tattered rags wrapped around his trembling body.And -- get this -- there is still a bit of snow on his clothing and the snow-soaked wool is STEAMING in the slight heat of the room. The shot only lasts one or two seconds. In the name of Bog, would anyone but Lean have thought of such a slight detail? There are other moments that might make the hair of the vulnerable rise.A passenger train stuffed with refugees has been chugging along eastward and is shunted on to a spur to allow the passage of an express. The passenger train is dilapidated, without toilets, without chairs, nothing. Each car has a single stove that throws negligible heat. The floors are covered with hay and disinfectants. While the train sits silently, some of its passengers step out into the snow to stretch their legs and grumble at the delay. Then the express appears on the horizon. It's the personal train of Strelnikov, Tom Courtenay, and it's panels are painted red and its crossed red flags are whipping in the wind as it roars past the astonished pedestrians. WHOOOOOSH! And it disappears in a swirl of snow.The story itself is, to me, less interesting than the film as a whole. It reminds me of 'Crime and Punishment', in which everyone seems to know everyone else, as if Petersberg were a small village. This tale is long, a little confusing, criss-crossed with meetings between men and women who are relatives, old friends, present or past lovers, or virtual strangers. History is pitted against human emotions like love. It's either one or the other. You can't have your babka and eat it too.There is an abundance of suffering with brief interludes of serenity that are always disrupted by historical events. Zhivago is in love with Lara but is married to someone else, Geraldine Chaplin. He has children by both. Well -- as I said, it's not ALL suffering.What impressed me as much as the striking visuals, as much as the Jack Frost window prints dissolving into a field of nodding jonquils, was the fact that, as narrator Alec Guiness puts it, 'He was a Russian and Russians love poetry.' By the time Sheriff passes from the scene, he's a nationally famous figure, adored by all. Why? Because he wrote such splendid poetry. What a queer country, right? (Question for Americans: Who is our Poet Laureate?) I've had a young Russian, who's self-taught English was no more than two years old, point out to me contradictions in a famous poem by Robert Frost. I don't know why so many of us find a love for poetry to be effete, not masculine or practical enough. General Patton wrote poetry. The commanders of the armies of ancient Greece wrote poems on the nights before battles. The Japanese warriors of World War II left poems behind for their loved ones before suicide missions. Yet, for Americans, such an amour fou implies one foot in fairydom.",7,3,5,3 October 2009
U-571," Silly Fictional Submarine Fare.
","There really isn't much to be said about this hokey story of an event that never happened during World War II. The movie involves ratty German U-boat sailors, scared but brave and religious American sailors, the capture of a German coding device called Enigma that we already had, impossible triple somersaults in the incidents -- and every submarine cliché in the cinematic code book.The main plot has an American crew trying to maneuver a damaged U-boat into an Allied port while simultaneously keeping it afloat, causing it to move, avoiding the Germans who are searching frantically for it, and meanwhile being attacked by another German submarine and a German destroyer. I had a bit of trouble keeping that all-American crew straight. They're all blandly even featured, except for Harvey Keitel who definitely is in the wrong movie.The B story is about the Lieutenant in charge, about his character, about the crew's doubts, about whether or not he has the guts to command and order men to their deaths. (Guess whether he does or not.) The writers, producers, and director have absorbed lessons from other submarine movies, from 'Destination Tokyo' to 'Das Boot.' At one point, the captain has to dive to plutonian depths the U-boat was never designed for and we can watch the arrow on the familiar Tiefenmesser mope its way into the red part of the dial -- and then beyond -- while the hull creaks from the increasing pressure. The men hold onto fittings and gawk at the bulkheads and one of them mutters, 'Man, them Krauts sure know how to build 'em.' (Cf: KaEl Curt Jurgens' line in 'The Enemy Below' under identical circumstances, 'They build them good in Germany, huh?') So the hull is creaking and the men are scared to death and the minatory destroyer circles overhead and the only lights are from feeble portable lamps and flashlights and I'm thinking, 'Wait a minute! Where are the popping bolts? Where's the squirting water and the shattered glass instruments?' Didn't have long to wait.To trick the destroyer into believing that the U-boat has sunk, the captain has fuel released from the tanks and shoots some debris from one of the torpedo tubes. The debris includes a dead conveniently body, as in -- which one was it? -- 'Run Silent, Run Deep'? You know, the one with Clark Gable? Not that the sleight-of-hand works. If it did, we would be deprived of the thrill of watching the pursuing destroyer blown out of the water with the wounded submarine's lone remaining torpedo.The clichés never seem to end, and they're not drawn entirely from the submarine genre either. Two men -- one good guy and one bad guy -- are struggling face to face with a pistol between them. A shot is heard. The struggle stops. The good guy wears a shocked expression and backs slowly away. The bad guy smiles slightly -- and then slumps dead to the deck. I'm fairly sure the first time such a scene was presented to the public was in a comedy by Aristophanes.Where was I? Think I had a period of microsleep there. Anyway, there are thrills galore during the action sequences that seem to comprise half the movie. The cuts are instantaneous. Depth charge patterns yield a dozen explosions in speedy sequence. The camera jiggles. The men dash about, shouting. Lights flash on and off. Sparks fly like the Fourth of July. The chuckling director darts for a second in front of the camera lens and gives the audience the finger. BANG! BOOM! 'She's coming apart!'Want to see a submarine movie you can believe? Rent 'Das Boot.' Of course 'Das Boot' is long, precisely observed, contains some leisure moments that tell us things about individuals, and it has subtitles, so if 'U 571' is your kind of movie, 'Das Boot' probably is not.",2,6,11,2 January 2009
The Shining," Lavish B Horror.
","The photography is exquisite, the score insinuating, the direction unblemished, and the acting sumptuous. It's so good that even Steven King's usual pulp horror script can't undo it.From the opening scenes of an insignificant Volkswagon beetle snaking up the deserted road towards an old fortress-like hotel, with an ominous, electronic Dies Irae providing the accompaniment, we know we're in some strange territory. At the wheel of that tiny car is Jack Nicholson who is about to be hired as the winter caretaker of the Hotel Overlook. He brings his family, goggle-eyed but beautiful Shelley Duval, and his cute little son along to keep him company while he does his minimal manual chores and tries to write the great American novel. Things begin to go wrong. The echo of things past begins to make itself heard. Nicholson goes berserk, kills a good Samaritan (Scatman Crothers) with an ax and hunts down his wife and child. Duval manages to reach the snow cat, the only vehicle that can travel through the monstrous snowfall that has isolated them. Nicholson chases little Danny through an intricate maze of thirteen-foot-high hedges, howling and lugging his bloody ax. Danny outwits him, escapes with Duval, and Nicholson is finally left to freeze to death in the middle of the insoluble maze, a more cinematic ending than the novel's boiler room.The hotel is a stage set in England and so is the exterior. But what a set it is. It comes across not at all faked but rather like stylized reality. Kubrik does a fine job. The natural tendency in a spooky horror movie would be to hurry the pace so as not to bore the audience of impatient teens. But Kubrik takes his time. The first hour does little more than introduce us to the characters, just enough information to pique us. The shock scenes are not sprinkled throughout the film but are built up to as logically as possible. Threats don't lurk in the shadows. Everything is visible. And the scenes are sometimes funny. The camera views Crother's TV through his bare feet as he lies in bed, under the portrait of a naked babe with an Afro the size of a medicine ball. His camera placement is original. Often the scenes are brightly lighted and the characters seem to be without makeup and the conversational pauses and hesitations stretched out to the horizon, a self-imposed directorial challenge.And an acting challenge too. Jack Nicholson has been in better films but his performance here has never been topped. There are some long takes during which he speaks to Loyd, the ghostly bartender, while looking directly into the camera. He delivers a superlative slice of ham here and elsewhere, winking, wriggling his tongue at his wife, snorting, making gargoyle faces, acting stupefied. What a performance. Everybody else is good, too, if not quite at Nicholson's level, but of course he has by far the juiciest part.The story is so full of holes that it's hardly worth bothering with them. Something strange happens to Nicholson, let's say. A beautiful naked woman approaches him in one of the hotel's rooms and smooches him while turning into a rotting corpse. Nicholson screams in horror and runs away. When Duval asks him what happened, he says, 'Nothing.' And if Loyd the bartender is a real ghost, and if the booze is real, and if Nicholson's character is really a recovering alcoholic who has decided to get off the wagon, then why does Jack order just one drink and then wander away to join a supernatural party? Why doesn't he say, 'Loyd, give me something simple -- a bottle of bourbon and a straw.' But suppose Nicholson is hallucinating the ghosts? Well, that can't be, either. One of them unlocks the door to the food storage room and lets Nicholson out. And Shelley Duval and little Danny see them too.This doesn't really torpedo the movie. It has too many superlative features to be destroyed. The holes are irritants but not lethal. A good deal of talent was lavished on this lowbrow script. See it if you can.",7,3,8,21 May 2008
"I, Robot"," No, YOU Robot!
","The end of civilization is at hand, if this computer-generated special effects extravaganza is any indication.The plot is impossibly loopy, but it all boils down to an evil central robotic mind taking over control of the multitude of harmless robots in 2035 and turning them into authoritarians programmed to save human beings from themselves, kind of like Klaatu and Gort in 'The Day The Earth Stood Still.' The sinewy, metallic robots that were originally mindless machines, have become sentient and questions about 'soul' are raised. Now there's a novel idea. A robot that starts to think for itself. I enjoyed it in 'Colossus: The Forbin Project.' I liked it even more in '2001: A Space Odyssey.' The latter seems to have given HAL's voice to Sonny, the main robot in this movie.If the plot is practically impossible to follow, it doesn't really matter because the chief notion behind the production is to have robots that look something like the denuded Schwarzenegger in 'Terminator' fight it out with vulnerable humans. It's one action set piece after another. These machines are all over the place, plotting, glowing with inner embers, their mask-like faces usually as mean as street thugs from an ordinary human action flick. There is dialog. And there are double crosses and mysteries and all that, but their function is identical to the dialog scenes in pornography. They just fill in the gaps between the parts everyone is waiting for.I could add that Will Smith is likable but his ears are outlandish. Some of the robots out-act the pretty but marmorial Bridget Moynihan. But why go on? The movie doesn't deserve more attention.",1,0,3,6 July 2013
American Beauty," Anomiville, USA
","You can probably count on your fingers the number of successful above-average films that have been made about surburban life. ('Lolita' is one. 'No Down Payment' is not.) Excluding the ones in which the house is taken over by a gang of rapist thugees or whatnot. There used to be a genre called suburban literature (John Cheever, etc.) but whatever visual potential the milieu of No Problem Drive may have had was drained by TV serials.Here, on the other hand, is a movie about exactly that kind of dull life, centered about mortgages and SUVs, that succeeds in almost all respects, from comic (the first half) to dramatic (the last half).I found it touching when it was released and figured, well, one viewing was enough, but seeing it again has only deepened my respect for the film and the people behind it.Truth, goodness, and beauty -- such rarely found commodities among the wisteria and the rose bushes and the asphalt driveways and the dinner china from Hitler's table. The dinner china from HITLER'S TABLE? Yes, it's true. The Marine colonel (Chris Cooper) who moves in next door to the Burnhams (Kevin Spacey and Annette Bening) has such a platter locked up with the guns in his display cabinet. You can't tell what it is just by looking at it. You have to turn it over. On the bottom there is no sign of the manufacturer, just a small, simple Swastika.The whole story is kind of about that. When you turn the pretty glistening object over -- well, you'd better not.The performances are uniformly good. Kevin Spacey is outstanding. And Chris Cooper as the counterfeit colonel is especially good in a strictly dramatic role, with his military haircut and his traitorous rheumy eyes. I don't know why they had to make him a Marine though. Never in history has there been a gay marine. Well, except maybe for Ed Wood, who landed under fire on Pacific beaches during the big war while wearing a pair of panties under his uniform. But technically even he was a transvestite. Why couldn't they have put him in the Navy? All those months at sea? And no women? Cooper may turn out to be an abusive father, a homosexual, and a murderer, but you feel sorry for the guy anyway when he has to come to terms with himself. In fact there isn't a soul in this movie for whom you don't feel at least some pity. That's a feat in itself. A movie with no one-dimensional heavies. Only one gunshot fired in anger -- and off screen. And only two sex scenes -- one comic and the other unfulfilled.The story is well written and well photographed. (Lots of memorable tag lines.) One of those empty plastic little bags that junk food is carried in, dancing around in a breeze, with its chorus of tannin-colored fall leaves.Not that it doesn't have its weaknesses. What movie is perfect? The transition from comedy to drama is deftly handled but some of the character development seems rather abrupt and over-edited. Mena Suvari, as the empty-headed narcissistic 17-year-old is told she is 'ordinary' by a boy her age. She calls him a psycho freak and storms out of the room, 'weirded out.' She's correct in calling him freaky. I don't believe he blinks once in the entire movie. But, okay, so someone she despises has told her she's ugly and ordinary. She's angry and dismissive. And yet the next time we see her (in a romantic moonlit living room with Spacey) her eyes are watering and she has undergone an epiphany. 'I can't stand being ordinary,' she tells Spacey before yielding her virginity to him, or trying to. Spacey has his own epiphany when he finds out she's unsullied. He has visions of roses, of majestic vistas, of San Quentin.And I guess I can't see why the movie sets us up for having Bening murder Spacey and then turning the task over to someone else. And maybe the overhead shot after the killing looks a little like 'Taxi Driver.' And I suppose having the narration by a dead man reminds one of 'Sunset Boulevard.' And the final voice-over by Spacey, about how the last second of life lasts forever and consists of memories of boyhood and husbandhood and fatherhood are a little corny. Granted some of the characters are hackneyed and all are overdrawn, but consider how unpromising the material was to begin with, as if Mozart had written a particularly difficult sonata to be played on partly filled wine glasses. But that's minor stuff. This is a good movie. Lots of pop songs from the early 70s if you're into that.",9,3,6,24 October 2006
The Alamo," Surrender is not an option. (?)
","In World War II many Japanese soldiers fought according to the Samurai's code of Bushido, the way of the warrior, battling to the last man and committing sepuku rather than surrendering. And then there's the kamikaze business.The response of Americans to this was one of mixed contempt and bewilderment. Repeatedly, we still hear on TV documentaries some variation on the expression, 'The Japanese fought to die for their country. We wanted to live for ours.' It was said that banzai attacks were made by soldiers crazed by drugs or hopped up on saki. 'Fanatics,' we called them.We have in this movie a reflection of that ethos, only here they are called heroes because they're on 'our' side. It's never convincingly explained why they threw their lives away. Maybe, for any number of reasons, they wanted to exchange fire with the Mexicans -- 'The drunk delight of battle with my peers.'I know that's a discomforting thought. In behavioral science it's called the social construction of reality.It's a well-done movie. Hancock is an efficient and perceptive director. The script is more thoughtful and less condescending than John Wayne's version of the story, and the acting is better too, particularly Billy Bob Thornton, who is an amazingly versatile actor. As Davy Crockett his flabby and expressive face radiates a gleam of mischief and irony most of the time, while at other moments he seems to be contemplating a bust of Homer. He's outstanding. Dennis Quaid is good too, an actor who always brings something interesting to each performance -- as Sam Houston, a husky voice and determined frown -- but he's not on screen that much.The battle scenes are well staged. The script gives all of the Americans and their compadres a courage touched by doubt. It also treats the Mexican soldiers as human beings. (It's a good thing our neighbors to the south aren't North Koreans or Iranians, eh?) But there is a heavy -- Santa Ana. A real grease ball of a heavy too, with an unprepossessing face painted like a corpse in a funeral parlor, thin lips, an arrogant sneer, and a complete disregard for the lives of his men or anybody else. 'What are the lives of soldiers? They are like chickens.' Needless to say, any legitimate claims Mexico might have had on Texas aren't gone into.And yet this is an improvement over John Wayne's 1960 rendering. In the earlier film, the Americans are mostly comic figures playing lowbrow tricks on one another -- if you want to start a fight you have to knock a feather off your opponent's nose. Wayne's men all die super heroic deaths, with a mortally wounded Wayne deliberately blowing up an ammunition magazine, taking himself and dozens of the enemy with him. It's not exactly a 'kamikaze' death but it will do. In this more recent movie, the men die for the most part just like everybody else inside the walls, except for Crockett who disdainfully invites the Mexican soldiers to perform their variation of harikiri on him.The special effects deserve mention too. I really don't know much about the Alamo or the military technology of the time but it's interesting to see cannonballs with fuzes, which sometimes sputter out. The camera even shows us the point of view of a Mexican cannonball soaring through the sky and plopping down in the middle of the Alamo's zocalo. And to see the effects of grapeshot or cannister on massed troops. In most movies set around this time or a bit later, in the Civil War, we never get to see a cannonball hit the ground. There is simply an explosion and a few stunt men are tossed into the air. Grapeshot is never shown and I don't know why, because in close quarters it was murderous, far more devastating to attacking troops than musket fire. Grapeshot turns a cannon into a huge shotgun full of bullet-sized balls. Cannister shot takes the shell into the midst of the enemy before it explodes and sprays its little iron balls about. It was responsible for most of the deaths among the men of Pickett's charge. At any rate, technology is given its due.The movie ends after the battle of San Jacinto. I'm not familiar with Texas' history but I know something about movie scripts and this battle seems to be in the movie mainly because we won it. It's the equivalent of Doolittle's raid on Tokyo at the end of the unfortunate 'Pearl Harbor.' What I mean is that it provides a victorious ending, with Sam Houston astride a rearing white charger and waving his sabre. This story really ended with the defeat at the Alamo.I can't help wondering what this story would be like if the movie had been made by Mexico. How hard would it be to paint Texas as a secessionist province of the national territory, not unlike the Confederate South, except that Texas was being supported and populated by a foreign power? A nice symbolic touch. The Alamo is surrounded by Mexican soldiers who persistently play the Deguello, a song meaning 'no mercy.' It is sunset and Davy Crockett says, 'I know what's missing,' and he takes out his violin, goes to the roof, and using the Mexican band as an accompanying orchestra he smoothly begins to improvise a tune which ends in a sprightly jig. A nocturne in which one lonely fiddle defies a marching band, a cavalry march turned into a violin concerto. It's a better movie than I'd expected it to be. I'd recommend watching it. You'll get involved, even if you're already familiar with the events themselves.",7,4,7,30 April 2005
Judgment at Nuremberg," Verdict Guilty -- Defendants AND Movie
","SPOILERS.I watch this once in a while if it happens to be on TV because the performances are as good as they are. Tracy is the epitome of rock-ribbed Republican rectitude. Widmark is good. Maximilian Schell is nothing less than great. He deserved his awards. Burt Lancaster should avoid any part that calls for an accent unless the movie is a comedy. But Garland and Monty Clift are truly pathetic, for more reasons than the script gives them.But that's the problem with the movie -- the script. The trial is a court set up in such a way that we must fight the values behind World-War-Two Germany all over again. Except for Lancaster's character the defendants are inhuman caricatures. Werner Klemperer is compelled to be a malignant version of Colonel Klink. The others are plain nasty. And Schell must try to get them off by defending their actions, which is impossible. The best he can do for Lancaster is to argue that Lancaster knew the justice system was rotten but was determined to minimize the harm it did by working against it from the inside, occasionally letting rotten things happen because the rottenness was prescribed by the law. If you think about it, that's kind of what a judge is supposed to do, isn't it? See that the law is carried out? Here's how two analysts posed the dilemma: 'The criminal law usually punishes people that break laws, not carry them out. The responsibility imposed by such a standard requires a judge to choose between resigning immediately or becoming an international criminal if he enforces an unjust law or becoming a German criminal if he refuses to enforce it. This is a lot to ask of anyone.' (Bergman and Isamov, 'Reel Justice,' 1996.)But it's best not to think too hard about this movie. Some idea of its self-congratulatory and self-righteous nature is given by Abby Mann's speech when he won the academy award, accepting it not only for himself but 'for all intellectuals everywhere.' Really. He's very mistaken if he actually believes that this movie is in any way 'intellectual.' It doesn't invite analysis. It invites judgment based on hatred of the Nazis. Or, let's be honest about it, hatred of Germans. There isn't a good German in it. Tracy's butler and his wife seem compliant and obedient but 'we knew nothing of what was going on.' Then there is Marlene Dietrich, cultivated and intelligent and helpful and friendly towards Tracy. When the guilty verdict comes in, her true nature reveals itself and she refuses to answer his phone call, sitting alone in the dark, filled with the kind of anger that brought Hitler to power. (The Germans will never change, not even the best of them.)Tracy has a last jailhouse conversation with Lancaster, at Lancaster's request. Burt has been mute throughout most of the trial, refusing to speak in his own defense, but here he tries to tell Tracy, as one morally upright man to another, that he, Lancaster, didn't know Germany was going to turn into what it did. Tracy sneers at him and says, 'You knew what was going to happen the first time you sent an innocent man to jail.' That's judgment at Nurenberg for you.The movie never asks what a moral person might do in Lancaster's circumstances. Mann and Kramer don't bother to ask because they already know the answer. The rest of us may not be quite so sure what we might do because we are aware of our moral flaws, our weaknesses, our desire to get along trying to do well without stepping on too many toes or striking useless heroic poses. But the writer and director haven't really thought about it. The worst scene in the movie, perhaps, among so many, has Schell grilling Judy Garland (Judy Garland!), who as a young girl had some innocent dalliance with an elderly Jew who was then convicted of consorting with Aryans and was disappeared. The most damning evidence was that she'd been seen sitting on the man's lap. She stutters neurotically while Schell bears down on her and he finally shouts at her -- 'DID YOU -- SIT -- ON -- HIS -- LAP???' Enough is enough, finally. I really dislike this movie for its fake humanitarianism. The victims were innocent, but does that make all of their countrymen evil? That's the kind of stereotypica, digital, black-and-white thinking that will lead to the next war, the next genocide. If the Nazis hadn't existed we would be almost forced to invent them because as a society we need bad examples. Without evil, how can we possibly convince ourselves that we are good? So we can all leave the theater or switch off the TV, eyes brimming with tears at the tragedy that has been brought to our attention again, cheapened though it is by this film, and go to bed glowing with self satisfaction.",5,25,47,24 November 2003
Heartbreak Ridge," Dress Right! Well -- Okay, Left.
","Clint made this during a sort of transitional stage, between movies that (had he not made them) would have gone straight to a drive-in movie and those that provoke thoughts running slightly deeper than how to keep your orang-utan amused.In 'Heartbreak Ridge,' Clint is the gravel-voiced, much-decorated, combat-experience Marine Gunnery Sergeant whose new job is to snap a reconnaissance platoon out of the self-indulgent, rebellious indolence into which its been allowed to lapse. Nobody who hasn't been through what Clint's character has been through can understand him. His officers are morons -- one sadistic goon from 'supply' and a mousy new lieutenant who brags about his ROTC in college. It take the whole movie for Clint to show them how the cow ate the cabbage. The plot is positively hoary. Patton had the same job. So did Gregory Peck in 'Twelve O'Clock High' and John Wayne in too many movies to list. It's always enjoyable to see a rough, tough man's man walk into his new command and rip everybody a new one.It's kind of amusing too in its own flamboyantly retrograde way. You ought to hear Gunny insult his men by calling them 'ladies' and muttering that, though he may have just done them a favor, that doesn't mean they're going to swap spit in the shower.There's a bit of combat at the end, in Granada, which we invaded in order to save the sons and daughters of wealthy Americans attending an offshore medical school in St. George. Not to worry though. One man is killed but he's quickly brushed over. And the men go into battle with bullets zinging around them while exchanging the usual wisecracks and sometimes whooping with joy. It's not meant to be a serious depiction of life in the Marine Corps -- I hope -- but rather a cassation that reassures and numbs the mind at the same time. It would have gone over quite well with the teens at the drive-in. They could have rolled around in the back seats and fogged up the windows while Clint and his wife, Marsha Mason, had the kinds of arguments about family versus job that John Wayne suffered through so often.It was shot at Camp Pendleton in California and in Puerto Rico. It's almost an insult to the Marine Corps. The men in the platoon have let their hair grow out and some wear earrings. They dress and act like slobs. They openly insult their sergeant, who is a Medal of Honor winner, and threaten to do him physical injury. It was tougher than that in the Coast Guard. I mean it. Sure, in boot camp the Swedish maids were young, radiant, and eager to please but the Swedish language does not have a word for 'medium rare' so we had breakfast in bed with steaks that were invariably overdone. On the other hand I taught night school for some years at Camp Lejeune and the students, admittedly a select group, were as sharp and responsible as any that I've taught anywhere, and smarter than most. The Marines I knew would have looked at this the way you and I might look at 'Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.' Kind of amusing but in no way meant as more than a cartoon fantasy.",5,4,6,27 May 2011
Salt," Stroke-Inducing Action Movie.
","The Soviet Union, dead lo these many years, is revivified and set to its evil work again in this political chase story. I'd like to call it a 'thriller' but it's not. It's a 'chase story.' You see, Angelina Jolie is Evelyn Salt, a high-level CIA type in Washington, working under her company friend, Liev Schreiber. Jolie is their Russian expert and the movie opens with her interrogating a Russian defector. The defector tells the skeptical Jolie that the USSR planted a dozen moles in the US back in the 1980s. The mission of the moles: to assassinate the visiting president of modern Russia while he attends the funeral of his good friend, the Vice President of the United States, in New York. Russia will take this as an American plot and start vamping up its missiles. America will have to retaliate. Chaos will follow.How -- you, the discerning viewer, ask -- how did anybody in the decaying USSR of the 1980s know what the international situation would look like in 2010? And what -- you ask -- do these Soviet moles hope to gain from a nuclear war? Those are good questions and it does you credit that you've asked them. No, really.But that's nothing compared to the questions raised by the rest of the movie. First, let me limn in the general style of this commercial Schlagfest. During the opening scene, when the defector is describing the moles, he ends by saying that one of the dozen specially trained agents is named Evelyn Salt. Well, gosh, that's JOLIE. The CIA observers on the other side of the glass wall gasp. It's impossible. But then Jolie, with the flimsiest of excuses, departs the premises in a crash of glass and a leap from one window sill to another, one hundred and forty floors above the tiny street below. The CIA goes ape chasing her, and so does the FBI. Oh, the Russian defector escapes too. (What IS a 'Russian defector' anyway?) So, after the first five minutes a pursuit begins, with Jolie running through the streets in her bare feet, pursued by various agents of social control. Let me think. There are lots of bullets, a razor blade concealed in the tip of a boot, karate chops all over the place, cars careering down interstate highways, a motorcycle maybe, tear gas, and hand grenades. At the thirty-minute point, with my heart pounding and my tongue lolling out in a way Jolie's never does, I began to wonder how long this chase is supposed to last.It lasts the entire 100 minutes. There are pauses now and then but just for a few seconds, not long enough for anyone to catch her breath but long enough for one or another character to explain why this next chase is about to take place. It's like pornography. The sex scenes have to be linked by SOME kind of phantasmic narrative before the brawny handyman and the glossy masseuse are hauled in.Angelina Jolie is adequate in the part. I was never convinced of her acting ability, always distracted by that queer splanchnochranium and puffy collagenic lips and that inimitable rack of hers. She's unbelievable here, though not more so than the rest of the movie. She's given the powers of a superhero in a comic book. She can slide down ten floors of an elevator shaft just using some slots in the walls. (I won't even get into the rest of it.) You know what was a good chase movie with political overtones? I thought 'The Bourne Identity' was pretty good. It's not the genre that's offensive; it's the producers' conviction that if five minutes go by without somebody's head getting wrenched off, the audience will walk out. Okay, the less discerning viewers may ask why, if I detested this movie so much, I sat through it without my synapses being fused like those of any other ten year old. Maybe it was only through the seasonable interposition of a Gracious Providence that I alone am escaped -- to tell thee.",Null,3,6,30 July 2011
Duck Soup," Beyond Surreal.
","One qualification: You have to be in a receptive mood to enjoy this otherwise it seems flat and silly, just a reflection of your sagging mood.It may be their funniest movie, at least in the sense that it's hard, or impossible, to beat some of their gags. I'll give two examples, one verbal and one non-verbal.(1) The peanut/lemonade stand scene with Edgar Kennedy, especially the mix up over who belongs to the three hats. It's out of Laurel and Hardy, true, but more quickly paced, fits in better with the general sense of nonsense, and Edgar Kennedy's exasperation is superbly projected. The director, Leo McCarey, had also directed Laurel and Hardy and there may have been some cross-fertilization.(2) Chico is being tried in court and is threatened with 'ten years in Leavenworth. And if that doesn't woik, we'll give you eleven years in Twelveworth.' Chico: 'I'll take five and ten in Woolworth!' (Kids, Woolworth's was a popular department store at the time, belonging to a genre called the five-and-ten-cent store.) I was in a meeting of the staff of a geriatric center in Philadelphia some years ago when someone commented on a suggestion, that it would 'get you ten years in Leavenworth.' I hastily added the rest of the sequence. Everyone looked at me, and no one laughed. The moral lesson here is that humor depends a great deal on context.The context of 'Duck Soup' is post-World War I in Europe and America, the Great Depression, the rise of National Socialism, and the impact of the Lost Generation on Western life. The First World War was begun by the assassination of an Archduke. National pride piled upon ethnic pride led to one of the most mismanaged and pointless wars of the century, an exercise in absurdity.I doubt the Marx brothers were concerned about sending a message, but in retrospect that's exactly what they did. It's like one of those humorous birthday cards that make a joke out of growing older.",8,1,2,13 June 2010
Apocalypse Now," The heads -- you're lookin' at the heads....
","What a movie. Martin Sheen is an anguished Army captain in Vietnam in 1968, ordered to proceed up river to the Cambodian border on a Navy River Patrol Boat and assassinate a Colonel Kurtz (Marlon Brando) who has apparently gone berserk and established his own little, ruthless anti-communist empire in the jungle.It's a free transposition of Joseph Conrad's 'Heart of Darkness' but that hardly matters. Nor does the overall plot. We already know most of it because some of its features have become integral to our vernacular culture. 'I love the smell of napalm in the morning. It smells like -- victory.' 'The horror. The horror.' (Well -- that last is lifted directly from Conrad's novel, but never mind.) What Stephen Spielberg did so miraculously with light in 'Close Encounters of the Third Kind,' Francis Ford Coppola does with smoke here. All kinds of smoke. Gray smoke from gunfire and explosions. Amber smoke from fires. Pink and lime and lavender smoke from flares and grenades. People stalk slowly through it like images from hell. Boats drift through clouds of it.The lighting (Vittorio Storaro) and special effects contribute to the impact of the film too. Brando's first appearance in unforgettable chiaroscuro. A burnt orange light illuminates his shaved head from the side and turns the naked scalp into a luminous crescent. Then Brando bows his head, dips his fingers into a bowl of water and flutters his fingertips along the skin as if playing a piano or celesta.Sheen's boat and its two-man crew glide very slowly into the tiny cove which serves as Brando's main port. The place looks like mannequin factory. There are bodies and body parts strewn about. Bodies that are more or less whole droop from the trees and from the gargoyle monuments that surround the entrance to Brando's dark and beckoning castle. Hundreds of half-naked natives with spears and guns have assembled in silence to greet the boat. Out of this unholy horde dances a crazed photographic journalist, the ever reliably crazed Dennis Hopper. He shouts greetings, shakes hands, welcomes them warmly, but adds in a wary tone, 'They think you've come to kill him -- and I hope THAT'S not true.' He leads the stunned Sheen through the throng that opens before them. Sheen is gaping at some of the body parts. 'The heads -- you're lookin' at the heads! Y'know, sometimes he goes too far, but he'll be the first to admit it, man.' Brando is a warrior and a poet. Near the end, one scene seems to be a T. S. Eliot study group gone awfully wrong. He's a philosopher. 'Did you ever think that the middle word of LIFE is IF?' That whole climactic visit to Brando's fortress in the wilderness lifts the movie out of whatever sense of reality it had earlier carried and places it squarely into the surreal. It's just impossible. A viewer can't tell what consequences any given event will precipitate. There are two beheadings and a buffalo having its head half chopped off by the Bontoc Igorots among whom this film was shot. (Only three generations ago, they hunted heads. I was in graduate school with an Igorot whose grandfather had enjoyed such an enterprise.) It's about as arty a film as you're likely to see, if art means slowly and relentlessly digging beneath the civilized surface of human culture and uncovering the uncoverable nature of humanity itself, and that's not a pretty picture.",8,3,4,8 February 2009
Disturbia," Steroids.
","The girl friend in this desecration of Alfred Hitchcock's 'Rear Window' is Sarah Roemer whose character is named 'Ashley', as it should be. She's a knockout ex-model, along the lines of Gwyneth Paltrow but without the magnetism or talent. She has deliciously narrow shoulders and seems to hunch them up and hold them back, as if someone had told her it makes her look slinky and sexy, which it does. What a flawless figure. Yum.And Shia LaBeouf, of unprepossessing appearance, does surprisingly well in the James Stewart role of the housebound peeper. I'd only seen LaBeouf in 'Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skulls,' or whatever that miscarriage was called, and he was a blank.Perhaps the most compelling performance is given by Viola Davis in the small role of the police officer who puts one of those home-arrest anklets on LaBeouf. She's a marvelous actress.The writers have taken 'Rear Window', pumped the story full of adrenalin and various psychedelic substances, and turned it into a comedy thriller about teens. In the original, James Stewart suspected one of his neighbors of murdering his irritating wife. Here, David Morse, older and throatier, is a serial killer who hides rotting bodies all over his house. Of course, no one believes LaBeouf or, after she's convinced, Roemer either. They have an Asian sidekick, Aaron Yoo, who adds comedy and suspense to some scenes.I won't bother describing the whole plot. Parts of the narrative are idiotic, beneath imagining. A madman is stalking you in your house, carrying a lethal baseball bat, so you escape from him -- after a scene reminiscent of Nicholson's 'Here's JOHNNY' -- and you run into the murderer's house, searching for your mother, who may or may not be there. The basement of his house turns into a terrifying milieu out of H. P. Lovecraft, with dark sub-basements and pools of decomposing corpses, so the hero can fall into them and scream.I'd better be careful because I don't want to give away the ending, in which LaBeouf kills the lunatic and saves himself, his mother, his girl friend, and the Oriental gentleman.It's a surprising climax though. Pardon me, but isn't the dead killer supposed to explosively spring back to life? I can't imagine how the writers and directors skipped that cliché. They make up for it by using so many others -- the hand reached in from off screen and touching the hero's shoulder, accompanied by a loud electronic WHAM on the sound track. (Twice.) And the spastic movements of the camera during action scenes, making it almost impossible to grasp what's happening.I enjoyed it for what it was -- cinematic treif.",6,0,0,31 August 2015
The Patriot," Freedom As Secondary Gain.
","Sigmund Freud interpreted hysterical symptoms as part of the working out of repressed childhood memories. Someone pointed out that being sick also got you a lot of sympathy and attention. Freud -- no sociologist -- dismissed all that as 'secondary gains.' This movie, for all its epic sweep, doesn't really deal with freedom from King George's sometimes whimsical rules for the colonies. It's the story of the rebels' revenge on the British redcoats who are snobs and sadists. Independence, freedom, representation -- all that nonsense is a secondary gain compared to the motive to kill certain individuals who have harmed the militia. It might as well be a Western, with the redcoats as Indians, except that here it's the colonials who use sneaky tactics and the Brits who march around in loud jackets in the open, inviting attack. I don't know why it's called 'The Patriot' because patriotism has little to do with it. The writers and producers always have to handle the Revolutionary War very carefully. After all, Americans and Brits have been allies in any number of wars, large and small, and have generally supported one another since 1812, when those damned sons of Albion burned down the White House in Washington. Maybe that's why there are so few movies about the Revolutionary War. Classics like James Fenimore Cooper's 'Last of the Mohicans', John Ford's 'Drums Along the Mohawk', and John Wayne's 'Allegheny Uprising,' are all about the French and Indian wars, known in Europe as the Seven Years War.The Americans at that time weren't Americans yet, just overseas British citizens. We avoid Revolutionary War stories because the mental gears begin to grind and a lot of cognitive dissonance is stirred up. The result is discomfiting. It's good that we don't have to extend this cinematic tenderness doesn't apply to the Germans or Japanese. If Hollywood had to do that, it would mean an end to war movies.The film itself is rather routine, though colorful and filled with action and sentiment. Splendid scenery. Many slow-motion deaths, a hoary cliché long before this came out. There are good people and there are evil people. All the colonists are good. The Brits as a whole aren't really bad, just one or two rotten red astrachans in that crimson barrel. Tom Wilkinson as General Cornwallis (Kids: he was a British soldier) is perfect in the role. He plays it in the way of classic English actors, projecting thoughts and emotions without carrying on about them. He's been splendid elsewhere too, a fine actor.Poor Jason Isaacs is the sadistic officer, tolerated but not approved of by Cornwallis. He has the coldest blue eyes known to man or beast, except for those of my ex spouse. I believe make up has clipped off his eyelashes to make his icy irises stand out more ominous, as in a comic book. He may be a good actor too but there's no way to tell because the script has him trapped in a swampy stereotype. Everything he does is pure e-vil. Why, man, he burns down churches full of innocent civilians! Burning a church is one thing, but with the whole congregation locked inside? He gets his comeuppance in the movie, which his real life counterpart never did. The real guy went on to serve in parliament and died in 1833.Mel Gibson is okay as the Homeric hero, wielding his tomahawk, teaching the farmers how to shoot and run away, to set traps for the enemy -- but no useless slaughter. He was never a very expressive actor but he's reliable enough and easy to identify with if you're as handsome and well built as he and I are.The locations are splashy and evocative, nicely photographed. The sentimentality is less than I'd expected. I got rather a kick out of it, even though it was thoroughly predictable, right down to the smallest incident. If you enjoyed 'The Adventures of Robin Hood,' you'll like this too, bloodier though it is.",6,2,5,31 August 2013
The White Ribbon," Reap What You Sow.
","It's an ordinary village in northern Germany in the year preceding the outbreak of World War I -- or so it seems -- until strange things begin happening. They're not supernatural in any way. A doctor's horse in deliberately tripped, severely injuring the rider. A woman falls through a rotting floor and is killed. A retarded child is tied to a tree and thoroughly beaten. People seem to be hiding things. People disappear.But, unnerving as these events are, they seem to fit the frame of values in the village. We usually think of 'the doctor' as the sensible person. 'The Reverend', as a stock figure, is almost always for humanitarianism and forgiveness.In this film, like everyone else, the 'good' figures are possessed by destructive habits. The Pastor is taciturn and humorless and beats hell out of his many children for the slightest infraction, like being late for dinner. He forces one of his boys to admit to masturbation and chastises him. The doctor, victim of that horse fall, seems to be equally pitiless. He shows no sympathy, is schtupping the Midwife who is caring for his children, may have murdered his own wife, and is playing sex games with his own daughter.There are two people -- neither of them a barrel of laughs -- who are less than repulsive. The Baron and his wife live in the Big House and hire the villagers are harvest time. The Baron is overbearing, but the wife, although not allowed to say much, wants to get out of the village because of the 'malice' that is all around it. And the school teacher is a nice guy who is in love with the young Nanny in the Baron's employ. He comes to suspect the brutality is the result of a secret society among the children of the village, led by the Preacher's kids.Before his hypothesis can be developed, before anything is resolved, war breaks out. Everyone left in the village crowds into the church. No one says anything. Fade to black. The End.I don't know exactly what to make of it. It's a long, slow, black-and-white movie about a village gone sour. I've been trying to figure out how the war fits into it but I can't do it. The war seems adventitious. But it must be somehow connected to the transgressive events of the village otherwise why is it lurking there in the background? Maybe rotten people with bad habits cause war in some stochastic way? That doesn't work, because not only do the villagers have no politics or even any local allegiance, but Germany was sucked into the First World War just like all the other nations, as a result of a clumsy and sentimental arrangement of treaties and ethnic pride. Was the war a way of clearing up these bad habits, of getting rid of those strict rules and harsh punishments? Like hell. It led to a twenty-year truce, after which things got far worse than they had been.It's a movie that gives us no one to root for -- except the teacher, an earnest and sober Schlub, who is narrating the tale in his old age. It's episodic too and sometimes a little hard to follow, never mind piecing it all together. But I was caught up in it after the first exhibition of pitiless punishment. I'm tempted to say it didn't turn out the way I expected, but it would be more accurate to say that I don't know HOW it turned out.",7,0,2,28 January 2012
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," Get By With A Little Help From Your Friends.
","I missed the first quarter hour of the film and that may be why I was a little puzzled throughout. I understand that Daniel Craig is a magazine editor offered a lot of money by a millionaire isolate to find out what happened to his daughter many years ago. I understand that Craig enlists the help of a punk delinquent young girl who is a computer whiz.The problem, if any exists outside of my own head, may lie in the difficult task of translating a novel into a movie. In a novel, we have time to stretch out and get comfortable with the characters, to learn their distinguishing features. A movie by necessity compresses social space and simplifies the story. That's one of the reasons there are so many complaints that 'the movie isn't as good as the book,' and so few complaints that, 'the novel is a waste of time compared to the movie.' This must have been a long novel because the disappearance of Harriet, that fourteen-year-old girl, that took place so many years ago, happened in an Agatha Christie setting -- an island from which it was impossible for Harriet to escape and equally unlikely that she was drowned.So someone on the island probably knows what happened to her, but who? The only people on the island -- now and at the time of the disappearance -- are family members, many of whom are not on speaking terms with one another, for reasons not made too clear. Except for the fact that one of them is an unregenerate Nazi, it's hard to tell one from another. And when you add in the police and big business intrigues, it's like looking into a kaleidoscope. It isn't until a few minutes before the end when things clear up, and the solution turned out to be extremely simple.One of the resident family is Stellan Skarsgard, who is always impressive, no matter if he's a good guy ('Good Will Hunting') or a bad boy ('Ronin'). He has an easy-going psychotherapeutic demeanor. If a bullet pocks the plaster near his ear (as in 'Insomnia'), he just leans slightly away and looks slightly annoyed, as if he'd been pestered by a fly.Rooney Mara has an important role as the devalued computer expert with the leather jacket, the tattoos, and the pins through her eyebrow, nose, and lips. She lacks eyebrows too but she's no Mona Lisa because she never smiles. Neither does she blink. This gives her a fixed, determined, reptilian glare. And it all adds to the impression that her character has only one note on her instrument. Not even sex seems to arouse her.It's a long, slow, rather dull mystery with little action, though what there is of it is handled deftly. But I'll bet the novel was interesting because some of the dialog, presumably lifted from the text, is catchy. ('Isn't it odd, that we're more afraid of offending someone than of dying?')",4,2,3,19 October 2013
Rocky IV," This isn't Mike Tyson, this is Woody Allan
","It poses as another epic boxing movie but it boils down to a piffle.  I can't believe the positive comments this piece of garbage has received.  Is there no end to our lack of taste?  It's a 'guilty pleasure' only in the sense that having a dominatrix snap a wet towel at your bare buns in a guilty pleasure.  Rocky goes through his usual homey and decidedly low-tech training routine, schlepping a huge log up a mountainside, carrying it like a yoke across his shoulders.  (Oh, Lord, let us hope this wasn't intended as a religious allusion.)  Dolf Lundgren, who cannot act, is a sullen Aryan monster.  He's given a lousy haircut, in case we might not get the point, and even sports a black mouthpiece in the ring, in case we missed the haircut too.  Stallone almost always has non-Latins in the role of the heavies.  A couple of African-Americans, an Irish gang in Paradise Alley, a Nordic here, an Eskimo there.  I wonder if he knows exactly what he's trying to tap into, what tribal animadversions are oozing out of his cortical sulci.  He practically converts the Soviet Union to capitalism at the end. And all those years we were sending people like Louis Armstrong and Benny Goodman around as Goodwill Ambassadors.  Let's see.  Drago -- great name! -- can land a punch that packs 2,000 pounds per square inch.  That's 131.5789474 times the force of gravity at sea level.  And Rocky comes away from that final bout looking put upon.  And all I have to do is look in the mirror to see what gravity alone is doing to my face!  Watching this -- this -- thing -- I couldn't tear myself from the screen, any more than I could pass a highway accident without gawking at it.  What an execrable piece of movie-making crap.",1,21,43,10 May 2002
Dreamgirls," Interesting Story, Loudly Delivered.
","Three young girls, a singing trio, work their way up into the big time and find that it requires sacrifice.Jennifer Hudson has a great voice with a range from elephant rumble to dog whistle. She is the lead singer and really belts them out. The girls love singing and are very close.Then they are adopted by Jamie Foxx and put on a stairway to paradise. But the problem is that, though Jennifer Hudson is the best singer, Beyoncé Knowles is an absolute knockout, so she's made the lead.Stuff happens. Karen Carpenter was yanked out from behind the drums and put in front of The Carpenters because she was photogenic. Never mind the drums.Best performances are -- envelope, please -- Eddie Murphy as a nonpareil of pompadoured self display, and Danny Glover, of whom we don't see nearly enough because he's the guy who puts them together in the minor leagues and is ditched as they make their way to the top. Slightyly plump Jennifer Hudson gets her share of pathos.I didn't care for the songs -- at all -- or the staging of them, all glitz and the piercing shrieks of Gospel music. And during some conversations a character will start singing her lines, as in an operetta.If the songs don't rupture your basilar membranes, you might like the story.

In the Name of the Father," Original Sin
","Daniel Day-Lewis is Gerry Conlon, a Belfast Catholic. He's a young guy who leads a reckless life, throwing rocks gleefully at British armored cars, stealing from a prostitute's apartment. But things are getting rough in Belfast. A resolution has just been passed that allows for the arrest and retention of suspected terrorists for seven days without charge. (Seven days, nothing. How about infinity? Betrayed by neighboring and competitive falafel-stand owner, the despicable and damned-forever Shaymala, who is forever after me. May her tribe be cursed. Signed: Abdul Abulbul Amir, Guantanamo.) Well, Day-Lewis ships over to London where he leads a reckless, heedless, drug- and booze-besotted, frolicsome, life of hippiedom in a shoddy commune of like-minded dope-smoking friends. We don't believe in eating animals. Only love.The next thing he knows, he's in the slams with his father. He's been convicted of setting off a bomb in a pub, and his Da of running a safe house.The scene in which the explosion occurs is very well done. Here is the happy, fur-bedecked Day-Lewis in the equivalent of Central Park or Golden Gate Park, having his usual unthinking good time, when there comes to the gay group a distant but loud THUMP. They rise and look grimly in the direction of the sound. 'Sounds like Belfast,' says one of them.It would have been easy to make the Crown the heavy and the poor IRA folk the awesome victims, but that's not what this is about. It's about the relationship between Day-Lewis, a delinquent, and his father, Pete Postelthwaite, who committed sins a long time ago.Inmates have an interesting subculture. And it's different, evidently, from one country to another. These inmates are almost benign compared to Americans. American inmates have ritual verbalisms that excuse their acts -- murder or whatever. 'It wasn't personal.' (Probably taken from 'The Godfather.') Or, 'He had no business being there.' American cops have the same convention: 'It was just a natural act,' said when a police officer shoots or beats the crap out of a bystander. No problem. If one inmate has a fit and falls down an iron staircase, another inmate who witnesses it might -- might -- call the center and say, 'Somebody just fell down,' without helping. And the slams themselves are better kept up in Britain than in all but the newest slams in America. The direction is zippy without being maddening, and the acting superb. It's well worth seeing.",6,0,5,4 December 2007
Being John Malkovich," Craig's Other's Other Wife.
","This is a difficult movie to describe so you have to bear with me. John Cusack plays an unsuccessful puppeteer in New York, married to a thoroughly deglamorized Cameron Diaz. He has the hots for his sole employee, his tough and savvy office-mate, Catherine Keener.Then he discovers a kind of crawlspace in his office, at the end of which is the sensorium of the actor John Malkovich. That is, Cusack can be in the mind of the real John Malkovich, but only for 15 minutes at a time, after which he is spit out and flops on the ground next to the New Jersey Turnpike. Cusack decides that if he can't get anyone to pay to see his puppets he can at least charge the public $200 apiece for their 15 minutes in Malkovich's mind. (This doesn't bother Malkovich because he seems completely unaware of anyone else's being inside him.) But Cusack's secretary, Keener, has the hots for Malkovich and through this 'portal' is able to get his private phone number and agree to meet her at a restaurant. They meet, as arranged. However, when they sit across the table from one another and Keener gazes at Malkovich, glowing with admiration and a filthier kind of lust, Malkovich's mind happens to be occupied by Cameron Diaz at that moment. Diaz has previously spent time taking a shower with Malkovich and has found the idea of having a male's plumbing appealing. Now, she melts under the adoring gaze of Keener in the restaurant.Diaz returns from Malkovich and tells her husband, John Cusack the failed puppeteer, that she must be a trans-sexual because she has never had a woman stare at her with such love as Keener showed towards Malkovich in the restaurant. Now she wants an operation and she's going to talk to Dr. Lester. The astounded Cusack shouts, 'But Dr. Lester is an ALLERGIST!' The next evening, Cusack and his wife are having dinner at home with Keener. They explain the situation to her, then they both throw themselves on Keener at the same time. Keener slaps Cusack away and tells Diaz that, yes, she finds Diaz attractive -- but only when Diaz is in Malkovich.Then it gets REALLY complicated. There is a pursuit at one point through the repressed memories of Malkovich's subconscious, with Malkovich seen peeing his pants on the school bus and sniffing panties. (Malkovich -- the real Malkovich -- must have a heck of a sense of humor. His character admits to being stoned, and we see him exercising his libido, being snooty towards cab drivers, and so forth.) The story ends up with Diaz fathering her own child by Keener while occupying Malkovich.If this were a novel, it would be something like Kafka's 'Metamorphosis' or Nicholson Baker's 'The Fermata,' both attempt to follow the logic of an absurd premise. It also packs a lot of humor and pathos into the story, along the lines of Pirandello and Ionescu. Example of what I mean: When John Cusack returns from his first trip into Malkovich's brain, he no longer has the piece of wood he took with him. In the face of Keener's skepticism, Cusack demands to know where that piece of wood IS. Did it disappear in the ether? Is it still somehow back there in Malkovich's brain? Good question. Keener, by the way, is very sexy. She has a throaty laugh, nice limbs, and she is strictly utilitarian, only interested in money and sex until she falls for Diaz. She never heard of either John Malkovitch or metaphysics.As a film it most closely resembles something that Woody Allen might have come up with if Allen had been in the habit of ingesting psychedelic substances, or something Monty Python might have dreamed up without any chemical help. (I must say I didn't get much out of 'Brazil.') If you want a sense of the lengths to which this film is willing to go, imagine a scene from 'Swan Lake' being performed in front of a full audience, involving the entire corps de ballet, with a human-sized wooden puppet in the middle of a circle of ballerinas, and the puppet is unclothed, made of raw wood, with all his hinges and joints showing, and the audience stands up and applauds. In an era when American movies seem to have been formed by cookie cutters, this kind of innovation is startling.Should you watch this? Well, I'll tell you how you can find out. You go to a clinical psychologist, see, and you sit down and take the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI), and then you ask the shrink what your profile looks like. If he says ANYTHING like, 'You peaked on Scale Eight,' you should definitely see this film because you'll appreciate and enjoy it more than most. Otherwise -- well, it's your mind.",7,0,1,20 September 2007
The Men Who Stare at Goats," Noble Failure.
","Jon Ronson wrote the book this movie is based on. (Or was it Ron Johnson.) It must have been a pretty impressive novel otherwise the MBAs who greenlight these projects wouldn't have touched it with a ten- or even an eleven-foot pole. It brings together three elements that, perhaps in print, were seamlessly joined: comedy, nostalgia for the New Age, and social comment.None of it works here, lamentably, despite the reasonably good performances by the leads and support and despite the competence of the director.It's the script that's the problem. There ARE some amusing lines and funny moments in this story of a band of soldiers selected for duty in the Middle East because of their psychic powers. It's just that the funny lines and situations are so few and that they're so understated as to elicit wan smiles rather than chuckles -- and never mind laughter. My guess would be that the humor in the novel depended chiefly on internal monologues and the author's particular choice of descriptive phrases, rather than in the dialog or the situations themselves. That's a common problem with transposing comic novels to the screen, from 'Ulysses' to 'Lolita.' And to whom is the nostalgia for New Age beliefs and activities addressed? Who's mind will click when they witness the kinds of tricks the Yippies pulled during the Vietnam war -- trying to levitate the Pentagon and whatnot? And much of the parody goes farther back in time than that, to the early 1960s, somewhere in the temporal vicinity of 'Candy.' It's a small audience indeed.The social comment deals not just with the New Age but with even greater resonance with the war in the Middle East. We now have two wars going, or maybe two and a half. One is winding down in Iraq. 'Winding down' here means we only have some 5,000 armed troops fighting and dying there. One in Afghanistan is fully blown. One in Pakistan is covert and is not happening at all.The difficulty with the social comment is that these wars are so controversial and the country itself so polarized that nothing can be said about the conflicts. WHATEVER scene or statement reflects a value judgment is going to outrage half the population. The result is a chasm across which there is no tightrope. The actual wars -- the mercenary groups, the blood -- sort of loom in the background without being directly addressed.Nope. It's not an insulting film. It doesn't treat the viewer as some recently evolved species of moral ape. It isn't dumbed down. It's just not successful in its enterprise. I'm tempted to give it a decoration just for taking as many chances with the audience as it does. But I can't recommend seeing it because it's so dull.",4,11,17,28 November 2010
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation," Of Thinly Disguised Identities.
","These fracnhises have replaced the weejkkly adventure series on televvision. It doesn't matter who the stars are or what the plot is. Everything and everyone are replaceable. Okay, Connery and Stallone are out, but Damon and Cruise are now in. No more SMERSH but then we have 'The Syndicate.' If there are any consistent themes, they are advanced technology and the superior combat skills of the protagonist. Well, I suppose there are other iterated shots at a more molecular level -- an armed man is fighting an unarmed man and there is a shot of the weapon skidding across the floor; one combatant slams his forehead against that of the other and disables him, and to hell with Newton; a shoe stomps on the accelerator cut to a tire burning rubber and raising a cloud of dust. This film as at least one example of each cliché. It's just added evidence that the fall of civilization is at hand.Here's another I'll throw in for the cognocenti among us. An assassination attempt -- mostly out of Hitchcock's 'The Man Who Knew Too Much' -- takes place during an opera. It's 'Madam Butterfly.' Now guess which aria you're going to hear. At least no one will sleep during the bullets and acrobatics. The villainous organization here has no particular plan in mind. It's not an underground nest of rich Nazis or rabid drug dealers. It's only purpose, we're told, is to 'destroy the system that created it.' Right. You can watch it if you like. Personally, these sequels drain me of energy in the way that Hollywood has been drained of imagination.",2,2,5,26 February 2018
Jarhead," Jarheads Can Take It.
","There's a scene in which Swofford and his fellow Marines are watching the scene in 'Apocalypse Now' in which the Vietnamese village is attacked by napalm-bearing helicopters and the gooks are all blown to pieces in a shower of bullets and jellied gasoline. The Marines are cheering wildly and the killing. They couldn't be happier that the natives are being fried. That's what's supposed to happen to the enemy.They missed the whole ironic point of the scene, of course. The world is simply not a Biblical one of clear good and evil. But if they missed the point, it's not simply because a lack of sophistication and a desire to destroy is part of their adolescent nature, but because they now belong to a system that reinforces that view.I think I kind of missed the point of THIS movie myself. I'm not sure why it was made because it doesn't tell us much that's very new. The scenes in boot camp, I'm absolutely certain, were vital to the development of Swofford's character and those of his colleagues but it's not very new. We've seen it before in movies like 'Full Metal Jacket.' Not that it's filled with clichés -- the bragging Texan, the Brooklyn wise guy. Those are absent. It's just that there's nothing much to replace them. A football game that must be played in heavy chemical suits in 110-degree heat for the TV cameras looks, sounds, and probably is real enough, at least until the Jarheads start ripping off all their clothes while the cameras roll. Other incidents, like a truck full of parachute flares that explodes accidentally on Christmas Eve, are a little weak in credibility although, okay, maybe it did happen.The film shows us that the Marines are bored to distraction while waiting to be deployed in a combat area. There is an interesting description of how latrine waste is dealt with. But it's a little more disgusting than it is funny. The antics of the bored aren't very funny to a mature audience either. And there's very little drama.Jake Gyllenhaal I don't find to be a very appealing actor, although I haven't seen him in anything else. Peter Skarsgaard is fine, and so is the staff sergeant.Chris Cooper, as a cheer-leading officer, is GENUINELY funny because he's not trying to be. He asks his troops something like, 'What do we do with the enemy?' 'Kill 'em!' 'I must be going' deaf because I can't HEAR you!' 'KILL 'EM!' 'Eww, now I got a real (erection).' The movie needed more scenes like this. The first time most of us probably heard that routine -- I can't hear you! -- was either in second grade or at a summer camp in the Poconos. And here are these bemuscled Behemoths eagerly playing the same game, so steeped in a subculture that promotes blowing heads off and producing 'the pink mist' that they don't realize the reptilian level at which their brains operate.That's not to demean the Marine Corps. We need a Marine Corps, and in order to do the job they may have to do they must be trained to do that job without hesitation, in the unswerving belief that it is the right thing to do, the Biblical thing to do. And they're not 'retards' or dummies who are easily brainwashed either. I taught at Camp Lejeune for a few years and was never disappointed in their cognitive abilities.The problem isn't with the Marine Corps or with the young people who buy into the organization's values but with a larger and deeper system that makes the Marine Corps and its members necessary. It's a system rooted in human nature that knows no national boundaries and doesn't recognize uniforms.But that raises Big Questions that a movie like this, of essentially ethnographic ambition, isn't designed to deal with. The spirit of Camus hovering overhead notwithstanding, the movie is careful to avoid controversial considerations. Skarsgaard says, '**** politics. We're here, and that's that.' What we get out of this movie is a picture of day-to-day life as it was for Swofford. And the photography is splendid. Otherwise, it left me a little unfulfilled.",5,15,25,7 October 2006
Collateral," A Desert of the Mind
","In this one, Tom Cruise is a hit man who's job is to wipe out five witnesses scheduled to testify against a drug lord, and then beat it. He's a real pro. He's a steel gray inside and out, from his hair to his suit and socks. He kills ruthlessly, with no regard for whether the victim deserves it or not. 'I do this for a living.' But he explains to the cab driver (Jamie Foxx) whom he has coerced into driving him around that he was abused as a child, so that explains everything.There are a couple of minor subplots. An LAPD detective (Mark Ruffalo) begins to twig to the fact that the people being murdered so quickly, one after another, seem to form a pattern among the drug community. It's the serial murderer routine. There is even a boss (Peter Berg) who refuses to believe Ruffalo and says, 'I'm tired. I'm going home.' Then there's the woman. Jada Pinkett Smith, looking and acting pretty good. Her main function in the film is to give Jamie Foxx somebody to get hysterical about saving. There is the expectable scene in which he calls her on a cell phone and warn her that Cruise is inside her building, looking for her. 'Max,' she tells him, 'isn't it kind of late to be calling?' And will his cell phone cutting out, Foxx stutters, 'Anna, Anna! Listen. You've go to listen to me! Anna?' Tom Cruise is a killer made of ice except that he saves Foxx's rear end in a shoot out for no discernible reason. He seems to stalk through the movie like The Terminator on meth. Jamie Foxx isn't a seasoned actor but his very tentativeness, his awkwardness, contribute to the effectiveness of his performance as the pleasant unreflective dutiful son who is satisfied with keeping the cleanest cab in town.None of the other characters registers much except for one -- the city of Los Angeles at night. You know how they say, 'You're always loneliest in a crowd'? Well, you would never be lonely in L.A. because the streets are completely deserted. A few exceptions, true, such as when the plot requires a couple of street muggers. But, otherwise, we can be sure that if we happen to glimpse a pedestrian he is only walking a short distance, from one car to another probably. There is practically no traffic on the streets. The marmorial office buildings themselves are flourescently lit and morgue-like in their carpentered right-angled purity.The director, the photographer, and the art director have this urban desert in their grasp and it makes the entire movie better than an average action flick, although the skeleton of that primitive structure still shows through what we see on the screen.But -- well, take a scene like this. Cruise is forcing Foxx to drive him to another destination along an empty thoroughfare. They stop for a red light. There is no music or other sound. The cab rolls to a halt in slow motion. Neither of the two men speak. And then, out of nowhere, trotting across the city streets in front of the car, two coyotes with gleaming eyes go about their business while the two men follow them with their gaze. The animals seem certain of being ignored, and why not? Everybody ignores everything in L.A. It's brief but telling. Someone had to actually think about shooting that footage and editing it in.There is a final shootout on a ghostly subway train. The damsel in distress is saved.It's an ordinary action flick in its conception. No doubt about it. But its execution is more impressive than the original imitative script deserved.",6,1,4,14 May 2006
Dark City," Unfathomable Heights.
","A man (Sewell) wakes up in a bath tub, receives a phone call from a stranger (Sutherland) hysterically urging him to depart the premises pronto, runs out into the night-time streets, and is pursued by mysterious figures in black fedoras and long black overcoats, as well as a detective (Hurt) who believes him to be a serial killer. Later he runs into a woman (Connelly) who claims to be his wife but he has no memory of her. (I'd remember her.) Sewell, in fact, has no memory of anything at all from his past.Out on the shabby city streets, surrounded by ominous and immensely tall buildings, Sewell is astounded. He can't tell what time period he's in because the cars are from the 40s and 50s. There are a few other people about but they all fall asleep at the same instant, no matter what they're doing at the time. It's always night. The sun never rises. And he runs through the alleys, hides in niches, clambers over roof tops, always pursued by either the cadaverous men in black clothes or by the relentless and humorless cop. Later, he'll see the buildings reshape themselves in a few minutes, the city changing its face.I don't know if I want to give away what's going on. It would be difficult in any case because the plot is so full of twists and turns and so many of the events inexplicable. I'll say it has something to do with aliens experimenting with human reactions to staged circumstances.It's all the product of a wild imagination -- Alex Proyas was the director and writer of the screenplay. I gather he'd opened the film with an explanation of what was up by Kiefer Sutherland, the mad scientist. It might have made for a less surprising but more comprehensible movie. As it is, all those dark scenes and paranoia depressed me. It was like a gigantic jigsaw puzzle, only the individual pieces were all drawn from different pictures and didn't fit together. Even at the end -- after the earth-shattering CGI confrontation, considerable doubt was left about what had just happened and what was going to happen.I kind of like stories about the mysterious transformation of people, events, and things, but I prefer them to be rooted in some kind of reality I can get hold of. Imagination is one thing; chaos is another. When literally anything can happen at any time, there is no longer room for surprise. Give me 'The Invasion of the Body Snatchers' or 'Being John Malkovitch'. And I hope I never live to see another exploding head.",4,6,11,11 September 2012
Cross of Iron," All Hell.
","Sam Pekinpaugh has given us a big war-time movie situated on the Russian front, starring James Coburn as the savvy and taciturn Sgt. Steiner and Maximilian Schell as the newly arrived, dapper, Junker aristo, eager for the Iron Cross, the decoration given only for heroism in battle. It has Pekinpaugh's signature on it -- an abundance of painful deaths, more explosions than have ever before been committed to celluloid, and all in slow motion. The story is such that, if it weren't for some cogent lines, it could have been directed by Sam Fuller.I'll give one example of what I thought was a good line. At the end, both Coburn and Schell stand face to face, armed, and about to be overwhelmed and killed by the onrushing Russians. It's only a brief pause, but Schell admits his status still requires the winning of the Iron Cross. 'You come with me,' says Coburn, 'and I'll show you where the crosses of iron are.' It's neat because by a simple transposition of words within the phrase, Coburn has turned a medal (the Iron Cross) into a grave marker (crosses of iron). It has its weaknesses. It's really too long and too loose-limbed for what it has to say. As Steiner, Coburn is a monument to military perfection, while Schell is a stereotypical cowardly and spiteful traitor. Coburn does well enough by the role of the humanitarian but dedicated sergeant. Schell is a marvelous actor but he has only one scene in which he's able to put his chops on display -- when he tricks a subordinate into admitting that he prefers the company of men to women. 'He said YES! He said YES!' Schell is in a transport of delight at having finagled his subordinate into a possible admission of homosexuality which, as far as we can tell, isn't true. The effect, though, is to make the subordinate a compliant slave.It's not a bad film in any way but it lacks poetry of any kind. Pekinpah by this time in his career was describing himself as 'a functioning alcoholic.' He's lucky he got it out at all.",6,3,5,5 November 2013
The Exorcist," Almost Flawless Supernatural Thriller.
","Someone once wrote that 'The Exorcist' was an advertisement for the Roman Catholic Church, and I guess it is partly. I don't see anything necessarily wrong with that. Every story is an advertisement for one or another belief system. A man must stick to his guns and do what he believes is right, even against public opposition. ('High Noon,' 'The Fountainhead', and God knows how many others.) Or it's wrong to push ahead in the face of public opinion. ('Citizen Kane', etc.) Some belief systems are better than others but even the obviously malignant messages can be well framed. ('Triumph of the Will.') 'The Exorcist,' taken for what it is, is a well-constructed and thoroughly spooky film, better than the novel it was based on. Promoting Holy Mother Church may have been necessary in order to enlist the aid of the authorities in filming the story on the campus of Georgetown University. Some of the minor characters are played by real priests. William Friedkin, the director, tells us practically nothing of the back story in his least-informative audio commentary.It hardly seems worthwhile to describe in any detail the narrative itself. A normal young girl (Linda Blair) is possessed by some kind of demon and after many gruesome medical tests is turned over by her terrified mother (Ellen Burstyn) to two priests (Jason Miller and Max Von Sydow) to be exorcised. The clerics get the job done but it costs them their lives.The special effects were superb for their time. The performances are equally good, especially Lee J. Cobb as Lieutenant Kinderman, the cop who is investigating a death associated with the possession. He's been excellent before but never better than here, with his soothing, childlike, and perspicacious presence. Jason Miller is as taut as a 40-pound bow string. Even Linda Blair, who went on to do some awful trash, is thoroughly convincing.The director steps wrong once or twice, revealing a passion not for spiritual enlightenment but commercial success. Having a candle flame flare up and then blow out in a darkened room is a cheap shot but it works. So does a shot in which Jason Miller is hunched over tensely, a ringing phone explodes the silence, and he shouts 'Huh?' and jerks upward. Bob Hope could have done that. But these minor intrusions, though they remind us that what we're watching is 'just a movie,' don't detract from the aplomb with which the rest of the film is handled.It really IS scary!",8,3,5,9 December 2009
Now You See Me," Populist Gramarye.
","It's probably aimed at the same audience as some of Steven Spielberg's lighter works. Four magicians (or illusionists) combine forces to rob millions of dollars from an insurance scam, led by Michael Caine, who, baggy eyes or not, is still a presence to be dealt with on the screen. Ditto for Morgan Freeman as the debunker of magicians. Mark Ruffalo delivers a smooth performance as the New York City detective out to nail the Fab Four.And Mélanie Laurent as the Interpol Agent after the same gang of miscreant youngsters is -- Wow. If you subscribe to the concept of conventional beauty, she's got it. Only she doesn't smile much. Her default expression is searching and a little grim. Reminds me of a French concierge I once had to deal with. Makes me shudder to think of it. That wouldn't stop any normal man from throwing himself at her feet and worshiping her toes.Of the four youthful illusionists, the least youthful, and the only one I recognized, was Woody Harrelson as a 'mentalist' adept at intuiting facts from a person's expressions and body language. Of the other three, one of them, I think Jesse Eisenberg, speaks more quickly than I can think. Don't we already see enough of that on cable news and in commercials? Of course we don't want to bore the intended audience with elasticized phonemes.I'm kind of skipping over the plot, I know, but for good reason. I couldn't follow it. Illusion follows illusion, the identities of the principals are peeled apart like layers of an onion, and some of the supposed tricks aren't tricks at all because the explanations that follow make no sense. Example: An ordinary mirror reflects the person looking at it, not a distorted image of what's behind it. Well -- doesn't it? Not in this movie. An illusionist here can see through the kind of mirror you have in your bathroom.With respect to these magic tricks, it resembles 'The Game,' with Michael Douglas as the victim of a cruel conspiracy designed to turn him from a frigid ass into a mensch. Every trick pulled on poor Douglas must be planned perfect, right down to minor events that no one could have predicted would take place. Same here.The only method of coping with this is to relax and allow the fantasy to flood your mind. You know, try not to think too hard. Just watch the images flashing by on the screen, and relish the Ooohs and Ahhhs from the audience. The epic musical score will help a lot. And since you will never understand the intricacies of the plot, why not indulge yourself with a dose of psychedelic tea? When it's all over, it will make looking into a kaleidoscope seem dull.",6,0,1,9 August 2014
Gandhi," Noble Effort.
","There is no question of Gandhi's wisdom or his bravery. He was a standout on both counts. That makes it a little difficult to make a movie about him because flawlessness isn't inherently interesting. He would have been an easier project if he'd kept an opium den or liked little girls. A little realistic ambiguity never hurt anyone. Look at 'Lawrence of Arabia.' As it is, we get what I presume is a roughly accurate picture of Gandhi's mature life, wrapped up as it was with the drive for India's independence. I don't suppose it's giving away too much of the ending to say that his life led to the death that such heroic figures so frequently suffer. Why is it that people of peace are always assassinated while scurrilous and dictatorial thugs seem to go on ruling forever?Ben Kingsley is damned near perfect in the lead role. Not just because he LOOKED almost identical to the older Gandhi but because he captures the man's moods so well, humorous and dramatic both. The film is by necessity a hagiography. I mean, he's celebrated as a leader in India. There is Gandhi Day, a holiday. And he's recognized world wide as a man whose protests were, at his demand, non-violent. Christians ought to be sensitive to those kinds of values, considering that they were espoused by Christianity's founder.There is, of course, conflict, first between the Indians and the British colonial system; then between the Hindus and Moslems, which led to the separation of India into what is now three countries -- Pakistan, India, and Bengladesh. There was nothing Gandhi could do to put a stop to the violence, and the enmity between Pakistan and India lingers to this day.In the film, the Moslems seem to come off worse. Their leader, Jinnah, continues throughout to wear European dress, sometimes a monocle. He seems always to scowl and is dilatory during the independence movement.There are several cameos by well-known actors -- John Gielgud, John Mills, Trevor Howard -- and small but prominent roles for Martin Sheen as the kind of newsman who discovered T. E. Lawrence and for Candice Bergen as the kind of photographer who made Gandhi's a familiar visage in the Western world.The movie is somehow neither gripping nor 'epic' despite the potential of the material. I really DO wish we'd seen some of Gandhi's weaknesses. He must have had them. After all, he was just human. As it is, we get a picture of the kind of man who once had an awkward moment just to see what it felt like.Fortunately, the movie gives adequate coverage to the Moslem/Hindu conflict. But structurally it's a little anti-climactic. The proper fictional ending would have the hero assassinated just as the battle for independence was won, like Abraham Lincoln. But I don't mind the anti-climax. The reason is that anti-climactic events are often, as here, just as instructive as the events that led to the climax in the first place.It's not just the script that's weak. The director, Richard Attenborough, has clearly put a lot of effort into the film but he's shot it as if it were a TV movies. One close up follows another, not because they are dramatically called for but because Attenborough chose to use this conventional technique. No attention is paid to features of the natural landscape either. India looks like South Africa looked, although, with a few exceptional shots, we don't feel much impact from either location. The movie marches along, a little predictably, and lacks poetry.But the questions it raises have resonance. Is it possible for people to live in peace despite their differences in ethnicity or religion? Or must tribal allegiances continue to lead to more blood historically than political differences ever have, as the priest/sociologist/novelist Andrew Greeley has argued? Gandhi believed that peace could be achieved without violence, but moves on the international chess board constantly suggest he was mistaken.",7,2,4,18 November 2009
American History X," Chronicle of the Times.
","I don't think this is ONLY about Edward Norton's shifting attitudes towards white supremacy or American Naziism or whatever the organization is called here. Maybe that was the producers' intent when this was made in 1997, when some of the public were still hearing for the first time about the Aryan Brotherhood and all that.If the object was not just to entertain us but to teach us that racist-inspired violence is utterly wrong, the message seems not to have gotten through. We don't have race riots very often but the country is now polarized and angrier than I can remember, at least since Vietnam. The engine propelling that hatred now is not so much race, although that plays a part, but political ideology. One end of the political spectrum is so consumed by anger that the fantasies on which that outrage is based has come to look as anomalous as Norton's original notions of Aryan supremacy. In some cases, it's downright loco.Norton is a skinhead in an ordinary American family, though he himself is anything but ordinary. He belongs to a group led by Stacey Keach that meets in some kind of garage draped with Nazi flags. Norton's body is covered with tattoos of barbed wire and, featured prominently, a Swastika on his chest. This part of the movie -- the introduction and many flashbacks -- is in black and white.When a black gang burglarizes a house in his neighborhood, one of the gang is wounded and helpless. The shirtless and bemuscled Norton strides over to him and stomps his head against the curb, removing with one stomp all of the guy's front teeth. He's arrested and sent to prison. Norton's actions sound pretty bad to most of us, but evidently not to all of us. Ten years after this movie's release, a Texan named Joe Horn saw his neighbor's house being burglarized by two Mexicans and called the police, who said cars were on the way. Against the instructions of the police, Horn announced, 'This ain't right,' took his shotgun, went out on his lawn and said, 'Freeze -- or you're dead.' Two men tried to run away and Horn shot and killed them, later to be cleared of any charges.Norton's spell in prison rearranges his attitudes. Initially hostile to the black and Mexicans he is forced to live with, he finally begins to chuckle over a black colleague's absurd jokes in the laundry room. And, with the cooperation of the corrections officers, Norton is beaten and raped in the shower room by whites, in a particularly brutal scene. He emerges reformed and tries to save his younger brother from treading the same path. The scenes after his release from the slams are shot in color.The writing is sometimes rather clever. Elliot Gould plays a polite, vaguely 'live-and-let-live' kind of Jew who is courting Norton's mother. Over the dinner table, the unregenerate Norton tweaks him about his attitude towards the Rodney King incident and is allowed to make some points. (What if King were white and the cops were all blacks?) The mother tries to put an end to the growing argument -- 'What about some ICE CREAM?' -- and there follow about 30 seconds of a well-scripted and sublimely awkward silence. But the fight has acquired its own momentum, as combat has a tendency to do. Norton is hijacked by his amygdala and shouts poor Gould down so that Gould must leave the house and the widow he's courting. Norton's extreme attitudes have corrupted his manners at the table and perhaps wrecked his mother's chances for remarriage.I don't want to go on about this. Norton is actually pretty good. The character's attitudes are ironbound but Norton isn't stupid at all. Stacey Keach is a stereotype and is shown as such. When he laughs heartily at some racist remark, the camera practically dives down his throat. I haven't seen so many teeth since 'Jaws.' The writers have been careful to indicate that Norton's pre-prison personality has nothing to do with the Ku Klux Klan -- 'a bunch of illiterate rednecks.' Why not, asks the curious viewer, since the ideologies are almost the same? Well, answer the producers, we don't want to align the KKK with this despicable racist because we don't know how many KKK members are out there but we do know that they buy movie tickets.I really doubt that anyone learned much from watching Norton's rehabilitation or reformation or whatever it was. We can't identify with him. He's too extreme and obnoxious in all respects. We might learn more from a movie about Joe Horn, his killing of two unarmed burglars at somebody else's house, and his subsequent vindication by the courts. I'm sure Joe Horn had good table manners and loved his dog. We can see us in him.",6,2,5,2 September 2012
Pearl Harbor," Rude Japanese Interrupt Love Affair.
","It cost roughly $140 million to produce this chimera. At the rate of my current income, that would sustain me for 12,727,272 years. No kidding.Well, so it had a monstrous budget and professionally competent actors, but it's not worth much mention. I suppose it accomplished its goal, which was to use computer-generated effects and make money.Its chief utility may be to introduce kids to some elementary facts about World War II. It wasn't designed to do it, but kids may need all the help they can get. A recent poll showed an alarming percentage of high school students didn't know who fought whom. A goodly number thought we and the Germans fought the Russians. Does that constitute a red flag or what? Basically this is a movie about a nurse who loves two men, only one of which manages to survive the Doolittle raid on Japan. If you're interested in love affairs and that sort of thing, this is your kind of movie. The CGIs are nice and exciting. That ought to hold the interest if nothing else does. Ka-BOOM.For the record, Admiral Yamamoto never said, 'I fear all we have done is awaken a sleeping giant and fill him with a terrible resolve.' That was invented for the film 'Tora, Tora, Tora'. For that matter, the bombing of Tokyo, tacked on at the end with reckless calculation, since it had nothing to do with the basic story, was not done in formation as the movie shows it. The B-25s took off early and headed straight for their targets one by one, not having enough fuel to form up. They launched early because they were sighted by some Japanese fishing vessels and it was justifiably assumed that the fishing vessels had radioed the contact to authorities. The fishing vessels were fired upon and sunk by our cruisers. They were filled with men, women, and children, according to Rod Steiger, who was among the crew of one of the destroyers in the flotilla.There IS no really good movie about the attack on Pearl Harbor. A far better film of the period is 'From Here to Eternity' or, better yet, 'Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo.' I realize it's hard to believe but 'Pearl Harbor' is cornier, less accurate, and more dumbed down than 'Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo,' which is a 1944 movie made for adults not kids suffering from attention-deficit disorder.",3,3,8,8 March 2009
The Usual Suspects," Devil makes work for idle hands.
","This is a well-made and ambitious crime thriller, nicely acted and directed, and with a most unexpected ending.I won't bother with the story since I'm sure it's been thoroughly described elsewhere.The construction is a little complicated. Kevin Spacey, a small-time con man, is telling his story of a band of thieves and murderers to an investigator, Chaz Palminteri. The are multiple flashbacks and the transition from the present to the past isn't obvious. What I mean is, you will not see the pages flapping on a desk calendar while harp arpeggios strum in the background. Instead, there are quick cuts back and forth, sometimes with a time and date at the bottom of the screen to help orient us, and it works. We're never confused about when or where we are.I must say, though, that the rules of film making have become a lot more, well -- relaxed over the years. Around 1950 Alfred Hitchcock was taken to task for including what critics called a 'lying flashback' in 'Stage Fright.' They were bothered by the fact that Hitchcock used a flashback to illustrate a story being told by Richard Todd and part of the story was false, yet it still appeared in the flashback. Yes, film grammar has changed. Ain't it wonderful? When I said the movie was ambitious I meant that it seemed to strive for a significance greater than that provided by the exploits of a handful of losers. The mysterious villain may or may not be real. He is said to rule just about the entire criminal world. There is nothing he can't or won't do. The movie conjures up Professor Moriarty -- or Macavity the Cat at the least, the Napolean of crime. 'The greatest trick the devil ever pulled,' says Spacey, 'was convincing us that he doesn't exist.' Do the ominous shadows cast over the plot by this invocation work? Yes, kind of. We get a sense of the hopelessness of trying to pit ourselves against an irresistible power. It also drains away some of the realism that so many cop movies fuss over. If we don't believe in an arch criminal running the dark universe, then it's hard to believe the plot of this movie. In paying attention to its loftier goals the movie lacks the down-to-earth and familiar quality of stories like 'L.A. Confidential.' But what the heck. It's a good movie. If it doesn't tell us too much about human nature it gives us characters we get to know a bit about, lots of colorful and well-handled action, and something of a sense of tragedy. Mephistopheles outlives everyone.",8,0,2,28 June 2005
Die Hard 2," If you liked Die Hard, you'll love this.
","It's a reworking of 'Die Hard' with a bigger budget and clumsier plot. The formula, in only its second appearance, is already entering its decadent stage.Bruce Willis plays the same character and goes through the same motions and dresses in what appear to be the same clothes. He appears to be positively superhuman. Everybody shoots at him and misses. He can fall three stories to the asphalt with no more than a wince. He wears his blood in different places though. Bonny Bedalia could have been left out. William Atherton duplicates his role as egomaniacal spoiler, almost word for word. William Sadler is the chief villain, with a face so ugly that if it were a building it would be condemned. Fred Dalton Thompson demonstrates his striking range of expressions. When he's sad, he looks unhappy. When he's happy, he also looks unhappy. He projects deep thought by looking unhappy. Whatever the thespian demands made on him he projects an overwhelming absorption with some deep inner condition, maybe a strangulated hernia.The setting this time is Dulles, Washington's glamour airport. (Nobody of weight ever uses the other one.) The villains are terrorists again, only this time they are helping some kind of Latin American strong man to escape custody. At least THESE villains don't speak German with a Russian accent! They're the home-bred, good old-fashioned American variety, and some of them are not only heavies but traitorous members of the military elite.The score substitutes Sibelius for Beethoven behind the climactic action. (Next time, Kenny G?) Some of the action scenes are better choreographed than in the original 'Die Hard' and that's saying a lot, because the original had superb staging.It has come to this. We must now begin to compare action movies to one another by ranking them in terms of how adroit their scenes of slaughter are, because after all, what else do they have to offer? At one point Willis beaten, bloody, and freezing, falls through a hole in the floor and looks around dazed. 'Another elevator! Another basement! How many times can the same THING happen to the same GUY?' he wonders.Well, Bruce, it can happen three times.",6,7,12,7 January 2007
The Commitments," Good-Natured Story of Irish Rock Band.
","A couple of working class kids in Dublin decide to put together a band that mirrors the soul music of the USA in the 1960s. Not the Beatles, not Elvis, but do-wop and Motown. 'The Irish are the blacks of Europe. Dubliners are the blacks of Ireland. And North Enders are the blacks of Dublin!' As they audition other young semi-hoods of varying talents, I kept thinking of what a curious diffusionary path this musical style -- with its African rhythms and call-and-response technique -- had taken: from West Africa, on slave ships to the Southern US, morphed into Christian gospel music, adapted by Detroit, and back across the ocean to Dublin.It's not a style I groove to. The three young ladies who are backup singers are, by and large, okay, but the lead singers screeches and shouts and weeps with simulated transport. The sidemen on alto sax and trumpet are kewl, however, although one chides the other for spiralling -- 'That's JAZZ.' It's a movie that elicits smiles rather than laughter. The young folks are all pretty quirky and have problems dealing with unemployment and baby sitting. There's an almost constant use of a word pronounced 'fook' or 'fewk,' which I take to be some kind of Dublin slang, possibly relating to fish and chips.And there ARE a number of smiles in it. They watch tapes of performances by one of their heroes, James Brown, who does his emoting on stage, then falls to the floor after one particularly strenuous number, as if knee-capped. Aides rush to him, help him to his feet and guide him off stage. 'Fluke!', says one of the kids, 'Oi'd bust me knees!' Another assures him, 'It's all part of the ACT.' If you enjoyed 'The Full Monte,' which appeared six years later, you'll get a kick out of this. Also if you grew up during the Motown era.",6,1,4,21 June 2010
The Dirty Dozen," Above Average, But Pretty Dirty, Too.
","Twelve Leavenworth- or gallows-bound Army misfits are gathered together and trained for a suicide mission. The film gives us the tale of these assorted loonies becoming a solidary male group under the tutelage of their tough but practical major (Marvin) and his Sergeant (Jaekel) who accompany them as they are parachuted behind German lines to carry out their mission.Except for the last half hour, the movie is a kind of 'training camp' movie familiar to audiences during World War II. Everybody wisecracks and insults everyone else. There are fist fights and pratfalls. When a stern and distant colonel (Ryan) penetrates the secret camp he is humiliated and run off by the filthy trainees. Later, Ryan is further humiliated when the dirty dozen play on the opposite side during a combat exercise and manage to capture him and his headquarters by pretending to be on his side. (I can't count the number of times this had been done in earlier movies. Even Laurel and Hardy did it.) The laughs and grabass disappear in the final thirty minutes when the group's mission becomes clear. They are to invade an estate in which German officers take some rest and relaxation with their families and girl friends. And the film now begins to make us squirm a bit.Members of the group penetrate the castle and hide in various niches while others prepare to trap the German officers inside. The slimiest and most clearly nuts of the dirty dozen (Savalas), who is referred to by a staff officer as 'a malignant dwarf', silently knifes a victim in one of the bedrooms. The victim seems to have been playing a game with his girl friend who enters the room and begins inquiring where her partner is. Savalas is behind a curtain, caressing his knife like Jack the Ripper, and stifling maniacal giggles. The young woman finally grows impatient and says angrily, 'This is no longer a joke.' Indeed it isn't. Savalas grabs her from behind, covering her mouth, holding his knife against her delicate neck and taunting her for being a filthy slut who deserves God's punishment.The whole tone of the movie changes with this scene because we realize that these guys we've been rooting for all along can be pretty thoroughly murderous thugs.After Savalas finishes her off, bells ring, alarms clang, shots ring out, and all the guests -- men and women alike -- retreat to a bunker in the cellar. The dirty dozen lock them inside, then pour gasoline on them through the ceiling vents while the girls scream and the Germans shout while trying to stuff the vents closed. They don't succeed. They are all blown to bits and most of the dirty dozen are killed in the action.I don't know if the director intended it or not, but he's pulled us into a state of sympathy with these raggedy undisciplined warriors and then turned around on us and shown us that their mission consists of the deliberate murder of a hundred or more people, many of them innocent, all of them helpless. It does not leave the viewer with any feeling of triumph. Guilt is more like it. The greater message is that war itself is nothing more than organized homicide, not at all like a football game.The acting really MAKES this movie. Lee Marvin has never been better. And his support is great -- stalwarts like Ernest Borgnine, Robert Ryan, John Cassavetes, Jim Brown, Ralph Meeker, Charles Bronson, Donald Southerland. We don't get to know all of the men equally intimately. Some of the dirty dozen apparently have no lines of dialog at all. And sometimes the humor is silly. But all of that is papered over by the performances, by the efficient direction, and by wardrobe and cinematography, both departments outstanding.It's long but never dull. It's both an entertainment and a lesson. See it if you get the chance.",7,5,9,18 April 2006
Gone with the Wind," Lawdy, Mizz Scarlett, where's yo britches?
","Whatever you may think about the products of the traditional Hollywood studio system, this is one of those products in excelsis. This is not a movie. It is A MAJOR MOTION PICTURE! It's become part of the data base of our shared vernacular culture. If you don't watch it, you won't be able to understand some of the allusions on The Tonight Show and David Letterman. It's got more tag lines than Shakespeare's 'Julius Caesar.''As Gawd is my witness, I'll never be hungry again.' 'I'll think about that tomorrow.' 'I love you, Scarlett. I've always loved you.' 'Oh, Miss Scarlet, I don't know nothing' bout birthin' babies.' 'Tomorrow is another day.' And the immortal, 'Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn.' Selznik, the producer, outdid himself here, the benzedrine being a big help, as did the half dozen or so directors whom he fired seriatim. The location shooting is magnificent -- all those silhouettes against all those vermilion skies -- even though the location shooting was confined to the RKO studios and back lot. The photography with its amber side lighting is stunning. The musical score is thrilling, arresting, exalted, majestic, commanding, opulent, colossal, bombastic.Vivien Leigh sparkles. Clark Gable is masculine. Hattie McDaniel is impertinent. Olivia De Havilland is sweet. Leslie Howard is noble.And every one of the performers, leads included, is a stereotype. Leigh is the bratty self-centered woman survivor who realizes too late, sigh, that real love was hers to be had all the time. I remember seeing it on one of its releases in a theater full of proletarians and the guy sitting next to me watched the camera close in on Vivien Leight in her low-cut maroon dress in the birthday party scene mumbled: 'Dat's a good lookin' woman.' Gable, with his irony and pursed lips, is the heroic guy who shows up from time to time to rescue the heroine who is in crisis. McDaniel is the devoted darky who has no life of her own and lives only for her masters. De Havilland is 'pure in thought, word, and deed' -- a phrase I quote either from Catechism or the Boy Scout Manual, I forget. No man would dream of dreaming of De Havilland's knees. Howard is the high-minded weakling, elegant and honest, that women pine for but are soon bored with. He's the guy who reminds women of their first husband.I admired the way the film cleaned up the novel. The book, written by a 1920s Southern flapper like Zelda Fitzgerald, was loaded with N words -- and not just the words but the attitudes that they embody. I mean, in the entire movie, which is one hundred and forty-two hours long, the word 'slaves' is mentioned only once, a bellwether, the Klan never mentioned at all. If you visit Beau Rivage or some other Southern plantation the bungalows that housed the slaves are called 'servants' quarters.' You'll laugh, you'll applaud, you'll shiver with fear and excitement, and most of all you'll sob. This is a romance. There is about the same ratio of love story to adventure as there is in 'Pearl Harbor', except that here there is no combat whatever and very little violence. And of course no CGIs. The Atlanta that burns down behind the escaping wagon driven by Gable is actually King Kong's gate.In its lack of battle scenes it differs from 'Birth of a Nation' but the heavies are the same. Carpetbaggers and chicken-eating black legislators and Yankees generally. Not to mention General Sherman, who marched through Georgia destroying artifacts, housing, railroads, and produce as he went. Sherman is still cursed as a butcher by some but it sometimes seems to me that his march from Corinth to Savannah wasn't a bad strategy if you want to win a war. You destroy the adversary's ability to wage war with a minimum of casualties. That was the intent of the USAAF's precision daylight bombing campaign in Europe in World War II.Anyway, whatever its cost or quality, it can't be ignored. It's simply there, like the moon is there, or the Grand Canyon, or Stonehenge, or the Great Barrier Reef, or the African Rift, or human folly.",7,1,5,14 September 2010
No Country for Old Men," It Don't Do No Good To Be Fast on the Draw No More.
","It's hard to know exactly what to make of this film because it doesn't follow the usual narrative structure. Bad things happen to people, whether they are good, bad, or indifferent. And the soft-spoken but menacing murdering man in black who simply kills anyone who gets in his way, and even a couple who don't, walks away into the sunset. And the hero, Tommy Lee Jones as the aging Texas sheriff, isn't on screen for very long and, in his climactic scene, merely relates to Tess Harper an unilluminating dream he had last night.But, although I didn't always know what was going on, what OUGHT to come next, I will assume that the Coen brothers did and accept the film as projecting some kind of coherent philosophy about life -- even if that philosophy goes something like: 'Chance, the fall of a coin, plays such an important role in life that any coherent philosophy about it is impossible.' Very briefly, a young Texan (Josh Brolin) hunting deer stumbles on the aftermath of a drug double-cross. The ground is strewn with bodies. Ignoring the pleas of a wounded man for water, Brolin pokes around and finds a bag filled with half a million or so dollars and makes off with the satchel. He packs off his wife and mother-in-law to safety, but a transponder is concealed in the satchel, allowing Javier Bardem to follow him around and engage in the occasional shoot out. Bardem, with his incongruously saintly eyes, is one of those killers who is impossible to stop. He's like Schwarzenegger's robot in 'Terminator' or any one of a dozen other stereotypes. Tommy Lee Jones is Tom Bell, the disillusioned sheriff who tracks Brolin in an attempt to save him, and fails. Barry Corbin makes a brief appearance as an ex-lawman with even less optimism than Jones, who lives in a dump even messier and more thoroughly debauched than my own.There are other familiar faces in the cast (Tess Harper, Woody Harrelson) but what sticks in the mind are the bit parts -- the elderly Texan in the isolated gas station, for instance, whose life apparently depends on whether a tossed quarter falls heads up. He seems to have been plucked at random from the streets of Alpine. Or Brolin's mother-in-law, Beth Grant, a garrulous woman with terminal cancer. When a man offers to carry her luggage to the station, she comments, 'Well, there's at least one gentleman left in west Texas.' But then she adds, 'You don't often see a Mexican wearing a suit.' This is a darker story than the Coen's 'Fargo.' 'Fargo' had one psychopath and one low-level thug, and the rest were ordinary characters with weaknesses. In this film, the greedy and murderous outnumber the good. But, I suppose, following the novel, the blame isn't pinned on regional character. One frazzled sheriff tells Jones that it's all the drug money and the kids with green hair. Jones replies with ambiguous insincerity that he gave up hope when kids stopped using 'sir' and 'ma'am' as terms of address. The story certainly STARTS with drug money but then it seems to move on inexorably from there, turning into a contest of wills mediated by accident. A flirtatious young woman at a motel pool asks Brolin why he's always looking out the window. 'Oh, just to see what's comin'.' And she says, 'You never see what's comin'.' How right she is. A car running a stop sign when you're not paying attention can ruin your life.At any rate, the Coens have done for the values, people, and landscape of southwest Texas what they did for snowbound Minnesota in 'Fargo.' In Texas, if you want a gun you walk in and buy it. The majority of folks are given to categorical thinking but aren't unkind. And the landscape is raw and arid, no country for old men, not anymore.It's a pretty good film. The Coens are among the most original writers and directors working today.",8,2,3,26 June 2008
The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford," Ad Astra
","Man, is this an ambitious movie. It's long and punctuated only at lengthy intervals by any kind of gunplay. There is a narration in the style of a turn-of-the-century pulp Western novel. 'His moodiness modeled him. It dungeoned him.' Such a style beggars all description in a familiar Western story about the shooting of Jesse James, a crumb bum of the first order.Except that this is only barely a Western. They ride horses, naturally, and carry pistols, but it takes place in locations ranging from Kansas through Missouri to Kentucky. Nobody is a cowboy. You don't hear nothing' about nobody a-squattin' on the range or holdin' up stagecoaches. No, nor anything about Indians neither. Which, if you're prompted to think about it, is a little loopy since the Battle of Little Bighorn was only twelve years old when James was shot in the back while adjusting a picture on the wall of his home in 1888. For that matter, Lizzie Borden at the time was building up steam enough in Massachussetts to chop up her father, and Sherlock Holmes was in pursuit of Professor Moriarty in London. Exciting times.It won't be necessary, I hope, to detail the story. For one thing, pretty much everyone already has some grasp of the mythos. For another, the plot, as presented here, is pretty complicated. The film may be only barely a Western but it's certainly a period drama full of intrigue, shifting allegiances, and obscure motives, with a barely concealed but constant undercurrent of betrayal leading to violence.We only see one railroad robbery and that's at the very start, the only scene in which Sam Shepard makes an appearance as Frank James. The hold up takes place at night. It's very impressively done. The artful photography of Roger Deakins captures the approaching train, seemingly an unstoppable mass of iron, in an almost spooky fashion. The score is by Nick Cave and Warren Ellis and it's distinctively current -- no folksy violins or other clichés.Following this lone hold up, though, we must then follow the plot. I couldn't do it. I was lost among the dozen or so gang members and their kinship bonds. I don't know why Brad Pitt, as Jesse James, shot a man in the back after asking him to take a ride in the darkness. I could unravel the reasoning behind the killing of Wood Hite, or at least part of it. Another man was boffing Hite's old uncle's young wife and Hite initiated a gun fight to punish the guilty. Why Bob Ford, Casey Affleck, decided to shoot Hite eluded my understanding, since Bob Ford had no dog in that hunt, as they say.Brad Pitt is pretty good in the role of James. In some of his movies I thought he might be another heart throb who began to fade the moment he appeared in the public consciousness. When he showed up, all bulked up, in things like 'Troy,' I was almost sure of it. But he has greater range than that and evidently more endurance. Casey Affleck is Bob Ford and he's equally fine. His face is a little askew. His eyes look in slightly different direction, his high voice is cracked, and the actor adopts a slyly innocent, open-mouthed, slack-smiled demeanor that is as appropriate as it is misleading.The script is overblown but not dumb. Compared to the early Twentieth-Century Fox version, it's a masterpiece of maturity. In 1939, Tyrone Power and his friends were unambiguously good, except for the cowards Bob and Charlie Ford, who were unambiguously treacherous. Not to put down the enjoyable 1939 tale. I'm sure there are liberties taken with the historical facts in this version too, but it doesn't leave the viewer feeling that he's just watched a fairy tale with a sad ending -- 'The Little Match Murderer' or 'Hansel, Gretl, and Jesse'.",6,6,7,28 June 2009
Tigerland," Not So Bad.
","I'd gotten the impression that this was just another autobiographical study of the hardships of an Army training camp, rather like 'Jarhead.' Instead, it's an interesting piece about suffering, responsibility, and testosterone.It's 1971. Colin Farrell and Mathew Davis are friends, sort of, just out of basic training, now in infantry school in the Louisiana. The final week is spent at an isolated camp which replicates the conditions of Vietnam, called Tigerland. Soldiers speak of Tigerland in hushed, frightened voices.I don't know why they dread it so much because, as it turns out, except for one psychopathic maniac, it's not that much worse than infantry school. The sergeants should foul curses at the men, shove them, kick them, beat them to the ground and literally make them eat dirt.Plaudits for the photography, the casting, the performances, and the direction, which, thank Bog, doesn't use a wobbling camera except for a few minutes during a live fire exercise. No CGIs and no slow motion action. Nobody runs away from an exploding fireball. Nothing explodes. What a relief.The plot is an amalgam of elements familiar from other stories. There is the non-conformist who invites disaster by not cowering like everyone else -- 'From Here To Eternity,' 'Cool Hand Luke.' The soldier who is a natural leader of men but continually turns down responsibility -- 'To Hell And Back,' 'Fixed Bayonets.' The main message of the movie shouldn't raise anyone's hackles. Vietnam was a pointless shedding of blood, but it's not the Army's fault. They do everything possible to prepare the men for combat, even if it looks (and is) sadistic. The war was foolish but the men in uniform aren't to blame. How can it be wrong?",7,2,4,26 July 2015
Remember the Titans," Football As Metaphor.
","This is a corny but still moving story of a football team becoming integrated in 1971, with the whites led by Will Patton and the blacks led by Denzel Washington. I know 'blacks' and 'whites' are obsolete terms but that's the way the movie pitches them.The performances are pretty good. Denzel Washington is always reliable and Will Patton has done some superb turns on film. He was my supporting player in one of his lesser efforts, 'Everybody Wins.' The team members vary in chops, with some better than others, but nobody torpedoes the film, not even the lovable and pathetic football player with the build of a sumo wrestler, the kid so fat he can be seen from outer space.The movie more or less divides itself into two halves. I found the first half more interesting than the second. The first half deals with bringing two mutually antagonistic groups together. The second half, a moral vacuum, deals with winning the Pan-Tidewater and Okefenokee High School Championship or something, and not an opportunity to stir the rabid enthusiasm of the crowd or to milk a tear out of the audience is missed.It's hard to believe that the philosopher William James once described sports as 'the moral equivalent of war.' You know -- get that pent up anger out of your system in a peaceful and rule-bound manner? I don't think he'd make that argument today, not with riots so common after soccer games that England banned them, and not with a dispute over soccer -- what IS it about soccer? -- having provided a trigger for the so-called Football War between El Salvador and Guatamala. Three thousand people died.I don't want to get too far off the gridiron here but let me add that Denzel Washington is the first black coach of the Titans, the high school football team, most of whose members look old enough to have been held back for four or five years. How does Washington run the team? Like Marine Corps boot camp, right out of 'Full Metal Jacket.' He's a real hard-ass. Color means nothing to him. He's pitiless. And his ruthlessness lends the story some meaning. Let me introduce some experimental evidence for that claim.(1) The famous 'Robber's Cave Experiment' by Muzafer Sheriff. Sheriff brought together two antagonistic groups of matched twelve-year-old boys, gangs that had been labeled the Eagles and the Rattlers. They hated each other. Then they were both faced with a difficult task that could only be achieved by cooperation. Sheriff called it a 'superordinate goal.' It resolved the antagonism. I'm simplifying this but it's easily Googled. And I refer you to Ronald Reagan's musing that if the earth were invaded by UFOs it would draw the disputatious nations of the world together. (2) A 1959 study by Aronson and Mills that demonstrated that the tougher the initiation rite, the more group loyalty you get. By browbeating them so mercilessly Washington enhanced the solidarity of the Low-Country and Panhandle Titans, blacks and whites together. Basic training aims at the same end, and the harder the training, the greater the loyalty. Just being in the Armed Forces is not enough. You have to have your butt kicked. It's why you sometimes hear, 'Once a Marine, always a Marine,' but never, 'Once a Coast Guardsman, always a Coast Guardsman.' There's an element missing from the story, though. We see a lot of white antagonism towards blacks but very little in the way of black solidarity. Many African-Americans have built a wall around themselves and punish each other for associating too closely with white people. A hint of that reality would have turned this into an edgy adult movie instead of something that resembles a Hallmark special.The direction is okay. The football scenes are exciting and every impact of shield-clad body with shield-clad body is accompanied by an explosive WHOMP on the sound track. The same effect is applied recklessly to a football pass landing in a runner's arms. The musical score is loud and signals with reasonable precision exactly what emotion is expected of you during a given scene.",6,0,1,25 December 2015
Batman Begins," It's a bird! It's a plane! No -- it's a flying squirrel!
","It's reaching a point at which I no longer have any idea of what to make of these comic-book derived superhero movies. The budget must have been lavish. You ought to see Gotham. The glass boxes of yesteryear have become a little more baroque, so that Batman can swing from cartouche to Churrigueresque spatial decoration. Actually, he does do a lot of swinging, as well as zipping up and down, but he doesn't have to. He can leap from the top of a skyscraper and flutter his way elsewhere like a flying squirrel. Somewhere in the silent film archives is a short shot of a man jumping from a platform wearing a pair of wings strapped to his arms. He falls immediately to earth. Batman doesn't. He just make a loud fluttering noise, as of a bat. He also has a lot of gadget and an armor suit and what-not -- not including a gun -- that makes it possible for him to do impossible things.Where did he learn his principles, after his mother and father were killed by a poor person in the bifurcated society of the future? And where did he pick up his mano-a-mano combat skills? And where did he find all those gadgets that make James Bond look like a tyro? Christian Bale got them from a host of first-rate supporting players, including Liam Neeson as his faux guru, Morgan Freeman as the custodian of armor and weapons too expensive to sell to the army, Gary Oldman as one of the few upright police officers in Gotham, and Michael Caine as the ever-helpful Alfred. Every one of them is splendid. Even the villainous parts -- Rutger Hauer, for instance -- are neatly delivered, and Cillian Murphy, as the psychiatrist who has developed a hallucinogenic substance to poison Gotham's water supply, is superbly prissy and haughty. Tom Wilkinson is fine too, as Carmine Falcone, one of the honchos who will bring the city to its delirious knees. I thought I saw John Hurt in the cast, but no -- a dead ringer. Katie Holmes is very nice to look at, with her cherubic face, but she isn't given much to do.There is some mumbo jumbo about 'finding your inner self' and all that. 'In order to conquer fear you must become fear,' intones Liam Neeson somewhere in Tibet. But the acting and the Philosophy for Dummies are all distractions for the real star of the movie -- the special effects. They've turned the Batmobile into what one cop describes hesitantly as 'a tank.' The visual effects are overwhelming. They are to the rest of the movie what a wrecking ball is to the abandoned tenement it destroys.If you like special effects, especially those that reveal a city on which the sun never shines, although the rainfall is copious, this is your movie. You'll just have to sit through a little thoughtful advice on how to come to terms with your anger -- and you don't get the girl at the end, either.",6,3,5,13 August 2014
Zulu," Gunfight at Roarke's Drift.
","It seems incredible that one hundred or so British soldiers could hold off a Zulu army of about 4,000 in Natal in 1878, yet it apparently happened. The story fits comfortably in the template established during the American colonial wars against the Indians. 'Our side' is better armed and more disciplined and one of our boys can tackle ten of theirs.Yet, it's more than just another Western set in Africa, with soldiers in red tunics instead of blue. The Zulu warriors, though faceless, are given their due as human beings. When a soldier with a bayonet faces off against a Zulu with an lklwa, a short stabbing spear, both are seen as clearly scared.And the Zulus in this movie are really scary too. They don't ride around the circled wagons waiting to be picked off one by one. They attack in droves. And the sounds they make, the long low moans, the awesome thumps of a thousand spears against a thousand shields, is enough to turn your hair gray. At the end of the battle, the ground in and around the mission post at Roarke's Drift is littered with hundreds of African dead and wounded. One of the officers, Michael Caine, asks himself how he feels and his answer is 'ashamed.' The film explores the differences in attitude between and within social classes. The enlisted men are a rough lot, given to tearing at the bodices of young missionary women. Some are inveterate goof offs who malinger and hide in the hospital to avoid work. There are class differences between the officers as well. Stanley Baker is an engineer who gets his hands dirty. Michael Caine is from a military family and plays his character as an effete snob. When he runs, he holds his hands still at his sides so he seems to be mincing in double time. He must have had fun turning this aristocrat into a fastidious androgyne with a high voice, because Caine himself was a Cockney with a Gypsy background.The movie has another feature that's a little unusual in these kinds of action tales. It gives us a genuine sense of the fatigue the men felt. The battle itself didn't last all that long -- a day and a night -- but the men were worked half to death building the defenses and manning them during the fight. Even the color sergeant, the stereotypical savvy and rough can-do enlisted leader, falls asleep at his post. Mostly, physical exhaustion isn't dealt with in war movies because, I suppose, it's not nearly as dramatic to see men slogging along with their faces drooping as it is to see them singing and firing rifles. I should mention the score. Evoking the Zulu threat, it sounds like a huge locomotive picking up speed while still in low gear -- and absolutely unstoppable.For some reason I remember distinctly seeing this in a theater in Butte, Montana, during its release. The only other theater in town was showing 'The Unsinkable Molly Brown.' I'm thinking of leaving my long-term memory to the Smithsonian Institute.Anyway, the movie is colorful and exciting, and reasonably fair to both sides, given that it represents a more or less common incident in colonial wars that pitted white soldiers against people with darker skin.",7,2,5,28 October 2010
Saving Private Ryan," The Fate of Rebels
","Seeing it again, nine years after its release, you can't help being struck by how familiar things are: the pale blue cast of the photography, the distinctive special effects, the squib charges exploding not with blood but with dust when a man is hit, the clank of bullet against armor, the shaky camera, the enemy seen as dark phantoms scurrying through the murk of the battlefield, the tiny fountain of cork chips as a bullet slams into the dirt, the attention to period detail, the necessity of reloading at particularly awkward moments.All of this is familiar now because it's been so often aped, often in strong films like 'Band of Brothers' and 'Blackhawk Down'. I doubt that anyone could make an 'ordinary' war film anymore. Slow, cheap ones like Sam Fuller's or even innovative grunt's-view stories like 'Platoon.' If you're going to make a war movie now, Spielberg's 'Saving Private Ryan' is the bogie you have to match. It is the fate of rebels to found orthodoxies.And what an innovation this movie was. Oliver Stone must be applauded for tackling a subject like the Vietnam war that was so controversial that the conflict was avoided for more than ten years, because of the still smoldering emotions the war had generated. If Vietnam had been a human being it would have had to stalk around dressed in rags, tinkling a little bell, and crying 'Unclean, unclean.' 'Saving Private Ryan''s subject is less controversial. First, the enemy really WAS our enemy. (Germany declared war on the USA first, not the other way around.) Second, well -- we won, didn't we? But it is probably more original in its details. And candid too. A German and an American soldier are locked in bitter mano a mano conflict, and the German wins! And not by cheating either! He is the bigger man and finally overpowers the American and inch by inch sinks the American's own bayonet into his chest. He does not gloat or smile. It's no tennis game to the German, but a deadly necessity, just as it is for the American soldier. 'Relax,' the German pants in a low voice, 'it's very simple,' as the tip of the knife slowly penetrates the American's chest. The scene is phenomenally stark.The most complex character is Upham's. The rest of the Americans play their assigned roles, performing impossible feats of bravery. This is precisely what the Germans are doing too. But Upham fails at a crucial point and costs the lives of his allies. The viewer can sit back and make Olympian judgments about Upham's character, but consider that for every hour Upham spent in combat he was as valiant as everyone else for fifty-five minutes. He translated, was almost run over by a tank, ran across open spaces under fire, and carried ammunition. But those fifty-five minutes don't count on his side, only the five during which he was frozen in tonic immobility, a fundamental mammalian trait which -- not having been in Upham's place ourselves -- we can condemn him for.Maybe nobody can define an 'anti-war movie.' They ALL claim to be anti-war movies. How could you possibly market a PRO-war movie unless we were formally at war with another nation? To many people, an anti-war movie is a simple excuse to give us more action and more blood. Put Steven Segal in combat boots. Others are anti-war because they give us a glimpse of the enemy's humanity somewhere along the line. But in all the anti-war movies we always seem to win, as indeed we do in 'Saving Private Ryan'. (The cavalry comes galloping to the rescue.) All war movies, even those depicting a 'defeat' like Pearl Harbor, seem to endorse the same bumper-sticker slogan: 'No matter how sneaky or noble they may be, they can't whip us.' I guess it takes an enormous amount of courage -- in Hollywood -- to ask an audience to pay money to see a movie in which we lose a war or a battle or a fist fight with an enemy. It's what I admire about a movie as flawed as 'A Bridge Too Far.' And it's what makes me feel more involved in the tragedy shown in 'Saving Private Ryan.' That hand-to-hand fight that the American loses contravenes established war narratives. What? We LOSE? It's as shocking as Hitchcock's killing of Janet Leigh half-way through 'Psycho.' Don't miss 'Saving Private Ryan,' a milestone at the time.",8,3,8,11 November 2005
The Pianist," Survivor
","Film makers have to step carefully when dealing with issues like the Nazi extermination program. There have been equally brutal programs of ethnic cleansing in places like Southeast Asia and Rwanda, in which hundreds of millions died, but nothing like this in Europe since the Middle Ages. The victims here were not only Jews but Gypsies, the mentally ill, homosexuals, socialists, communists, and political undesirables. The Nazis eliminated not six million but some uncountable number between 12 and 15 million. An event like that can't be treated lightly and milked for easy tears, or the event itself is cheapened.Fortunately, the films that have explored the subject have been uniformly well done, as Roman Polanski's 'The Pianist' is well done. Polanski himself suffered in much the same way as the protagonist, Vlad Szpilman (Adrien Brody). Polanski has a habit of embellishing his tales but there's no question that in this instance he knows what he's talking about.Szpilman is a well-known young pianist on Warsaw radio but the German occupation puts the station out of business. He and his family are herded into the Warsaw ghetto where they are subject to constant abuse and occasional murder. Szpilman barely escapes being sent to Treblinka with the rest of his family. And for the last half of the film, with the help of some friends who endanger themselves by lending him aid, he scuttles rat-like from one hiding place to another, each more dismal and perilous than the last. He suffers jaundice, his hair and beard grow long, his clothes turn to tatters, his food disappears, he's half frozen, and he seems to shrink.He's reduced to living in the attic of a nearly demolished apartment building and is ecstatic to discover a gallon can of pickles overlooked on the top shelf of a kitchen cabinet. The can falls out of his hands while he tries to open it and rolls across the floor to come to rest at the boots of a German officer, Captain Hosenfeld (Thomas Kretschmann). The only Germans we've seen so far have been brutes -- ridiculing the insane, executing Jews who ask simple questions, or simply shooting people chosen at random.We expect nothing from Hosenfeld except a quick shooting. But Hosenfeld is a human being and, having discovered that Szpilman 'is' -- or rather 'was' -- a pianist, he asks him to play a piano left in one of the flats. Szpliman has been unable to play for years and when he seats himself we worry that he might not bring it off and, indeed, his first chords are tentative, uncertain. Then his playing becomes automated, the old habits return, and he dashes off a dramatic and exquisitely executed piece of Chopin. Hosenfeld has been leaning back, enjoying the music, then leaves Szpilman quietly to his attic. He returns a few times later, before the Germans withdraw before the Russians, and unceremoniously hands him a few packages of food and, finally, his overcoat. The matter-of-fact compassion shown by Hosenfeld, and Szpilman's desperate need for contact with another human, are very moving.When the Russian troops finally arrive, Szpilman stumbles out of his hovel to greet them, but seeing his overcoat the Russians open fire on him. Szpilman finally convinces them that he is a Pole, not a German, and one of the befuddled soldiers asks, 'Then why the ****ing coat?' Szpilman is trembling with fear but manages to gulp, 'I was cold.' An epilogue tells us that Szpilman went on with his career and Hosenfeld wound up in a Soviet prison camp where he died in 1952, despite Szpilman's attempt to find him. Under the end credits, a smiling Szpilman plays a lively, sparkling composition by Chopin.It's a remarkable film. Polanski is no longer the Wunderkind but a mature film maker. Nothing is excessive. We need only as much as we need to know to understand Szpilman's travails -- one tragedy following another. There are no sentimental speeches at the final parting of Szpilman and his family. Szpilman himself never breaks down. He simply does what needs to be done to survive. And Adrien Brody captures what Szpilman must have been like. (From some angles he resembles the young Arthur Rubenstein.) Kretschmann gets Hosenfeld down pat as well. In their scenes together we sense their respective positions -- one man with nothing left to lose, the other with nothing left to gain. The story, and the historical facts it's based on, raise many questions about human nature, of course. I'm not at all sure that if we could find the answers to those questions we would like what we found.One of the better films of the year.",8,13,18,30 April 2008
The Grand Budapest Hotel," Elaborate, Funny.
","The writer/director Wes Anderson seems to have translated the story directly from Stefan Zweig's German, except for a few more or less modern interpolations, like 'F*** you.' Really, it begins in the Grand Manner, with someone telling a story to someone else, that is then illustrated in the following scenes, much like Marlowe in 'The Heart of Darkness,' missing one intermediary, I think. And Henry James in 'The Turn of the Screw.' It must have been a powerful convention of the time, around the turn of the century.The translated prose that comes to us is phrased in elegance, very formal and dignified, like the Grand Budapest Hotel itself in its fashionable early years, a stately pleasure dome, all pink gingerbread, perched on a mountain top, accessible only by funicular railways. (No riff raff allowed.) I'm afraid I missed the middle part so I can't spell out the story. I don't think I could anyway because it's not exactly linear. There are lots of characters, all somewhat cockeyed, and many incidents, some briefly violent.But if the story of the little lobby boy who grows up to be F. Murray Abraham isn't linear, the direction certainly is. I've never in my life seen a more SYMMETRICAL movie, a more CARPENTERED movie. Forget about traditional reverse angle shots, in which two people are speaking and the camera alternates from peeping over one shoulder to peeping over the other. Everybody looks and speaks straight into the lens.The settings are equally stylized. You want to see a huge dining room? You see it framed from the entrance, each side mirroring the other. The chandeliers are equidistant. When people walk or run past the camera, or away from it, or towards it, they seem to do it on x and y axes, as if the scene were the solution to a problem in calculus. There's no other film quite like it.Yet it's funny too. Near the beginning, when there is breaking news, we see a succession of local newspapers. The names of the newspapers run along lines like 'The Middle European Star' and so forth, and one of them, which gets no special treatment, is 'The Continental Drift.' The dialog sometimes descends from formalized and ornate into the vulgate. It doesn't happen often but when it does, it's a surprising and refreshing break from all those sumptuous phrases.I look forward to catching the part I missed.",7,2,4,28 December 2014
Seabiscuit," Be All That You Can Be.
","I haven't read Laura Hillenbrand's book but have heard nothing but good things about it. What is it that goes on between women and horses? Well, let's stick with the movie.Basically -- without repeating the story, which everyone already knows -- the movie shows four losers being brought together, by MacFate, and forming one winner. It's the depression in America and everyone is suffering. The owner (Jeff Bridges) has a high-need for achievement and has money, but has lost his son in an accident and his wife for reasons that got by me. The jockey too has tried several careers and failed. The trainer (Christ Cooper, in the Wilford Brimley/Richard Farnsworth role, and excellent)has run out of open range land as a horse wrangler. The horse is ugly, ungainly, and stunted. Basically, the weaknesses of all the participants -- or the bad luck, rather, since nobody seems to actually HAVE weaknesses -- are overcome and everyone wins.A viewer feels good watching all this, and the period detail is nicely done.The direction too has its moments -- if something dramatic does not need spelling out, the director and the editor do not spell it out. I did lose some of my suspension of disbelief when two jockeys in the midst of a race started exchanging greetings and bon mots.That said, the movie is interesting for any number of reasons without being outstanding. I like David McCullough, his sympatico features and sonorous voice, distant but not unengaged, but his narration evokes PBS, especially Ken Burns' 'Civil War.' It's a little demeaning to hear his voice behind such a commercial enterprise, talking about 'the forty-thousand hot dogs' sold at one of Seabiscuit's races. I had trouble with Randy Newman's score too. I like his score for 'The Natural,' derived from Copeland's 'Fanfare for the Common Man,' and especially the interpolated rinky-tink contemporary tunes. But this music sounds positively generic. When something important is about to happen, the music cues our tension. When it DOES happen, the music takes off heavenward with triumphant trombones and chiliastic overtones. The acting's pretty good. Jiff Bridges never fails. (His new wife is a pretty blank.) Gary Stevens, a famous jockey, has a neat face for movies. And Chris Cooper is fine -- a soft-spoken and candid rube, a bit of a mystic. And it's always uplifting to see a Comeback Kid, even if the kid is a horse.But a movie about overcoming flaws and bad luck is kind of easy to do. Everyone leaves the theater aglow with warmth. For every winner there are thousands of losers. I enjoyed the original 'Rocky' because Rocky LOST THE MATCH! If this is a movie that's not about winning but about doing your best, then why does the damme horse WIN? There's nothing wrong with upliftingness. On the contrary, it feels good. That's why they're so easy to do, and so popular. And I don't mean to tout despair as the most suitable philosophical tonus for a flick. But I'm reminded of a professor of mine who gave his class an assignment and advised them to 'do your very best.' Then he paused for a moment and added, 'Suppose you really did your very best and the results turned out to be pedestrian?' Never mind Seabiscuit, when are they going to make a movie about the rest of us who come in second?",Null,0,0,2 June 2004
Tucker and Dale vs Evil," Lawd, Where'd Ye Put The Redman?
","I didn't get to see the whole thing but the first half hour or so was diverting, full of rustic humor, and probably aimed at the good folk who love slasher movies and are ready for a parody.Half a dozen college kids go camping in Appalachia, setting up their tents at a location in which a bunch of kids very much like themselves were slaughtered by inbred Hillbillies. (Think 'Deliverance.') And in fact there ARE two semi-natural but good-natured redneck enjoying a fishing vacation at their nearby vacation home -- a dilapidated dump of a shack.The two groups meet. The well-bred kids misunderstand the intentions of the rednecks and comic scenes ensue.It seems well enough written. The gags are worthy of smiles. The acting is about what you'd expect. The direction goes overboard in bringing in hoary clichés. (A hand reaches out and touches the shoulder of a terrified blond, and there is a sting on the sound track, but it's only a friend.) If it were genuinely comic it wouldn't need to stoop so low.Still, if it were on again I'd try to watch it all the way through. Unless it turns into a bath tub of gore with meat hooks and so forth, it might be enjoyable.",6,2,5,7 June 2014
1941," War Drums Beat, Bodies Fly, Eyeballs Roll, Viewers Wince.
","After the release, John Belushi wore to a party a button reading 'John Belushi: 1949 - 1941.' That's how much of a failure this story of the Los Angeles panic in the wake of Pearl Harbor is.It's all done with brio but if Spielberg missed on opportunity for low-brow humor anywhere along the way, I missed it. If someone tosses eggs to a cook, the eggs miss and splat on the counter. If someone pours coffee into a cup, most of it sloshes onto the table. Belushi is piloting his P-40 through the Grand Canyon. When he gets a yen for a Coke, he smashes off the top of the bottle and most of it gets on his face, although a bit of it dribbles into his mouth, drowning the cigar stub implanted there.There are fights, flights, jitterbug dances, mockery of a Japanese submarine, beautiful young women wearing stockings and garter belts, an abundance of socks in the jaw, collapsing towers, crazed motorcyclists, and all of it thrown at the viewer at a frenzied pace.It was all done at least as well, if more deliberately, by Laurel and Hardy. Some comedies, especially those with big budgets, seem to fail for similar reasons. 'It's A Mad Mad Mad Mad World' and 'What's New Pussycat' seem to equate energy and speed with humor, and the two are just not necessarily the same. A genuinely fast comedy can be funny -- 'His Girl Friday' or 'One Two Three' -- but speed can't be substituted for well-designed gags. It's just not especially amusing when two men boost Belushi up onto the wing of his airplane and he rolls off the other side. We've seen it a dozen times, though most often with horses.And as I watched this for the second time, my mind drifting a little, I began wondering exactly how many of the period references and spoofs would register with younger viewers. They'll undoubtedly get the opening allusion to 'Jaws', but will they know that the zoot suit riots were real, or recognize the musical tribute to the score of 'Patton', or get the incarnation of the Andrew Sisters? The funniest scenes are those in which a firm declaration is immediately contradicted by events. 'I'll have no guns in this house,' declares a housewife -- and the barrel of a 40 mm. cannon comes crashing through the front door. 'There will be no bombs dropped on this airfield!', General Robert Stack announces during a speech, and a bomb accidentally dropped from a parked B-17 rolls toward the stand and explodes. But that's the height that subtlety reaches in this comedy.Great cast caught up in a pointless whirlwind of lunacy.",4,1,3,27 January 2013
Foxcatcher," Money Can't Buy Me Love.
","I have no interest whatever in wrestling and very little in the life styles of the enormously wealthy except in comedies but this film is original and curiously gripping throughout.The story is based on historical fact and goes something like this. Channing Tatum is an taciturn amateur wrestler hoping to compete in the Olympics of 1988. His brother Mark Ruffalo is his older brother, coach, and best friend -- or ONLY friend as far as we're able to discern. Ruffalo is a laid back kind of guy, supporting his wife and two daughters. Both brothers live in one of those Northeast working-class shack towns of the sort I grew up in.Then, one day, fate steps into their lives. Du Fate takes the corporeal form of Steve Carell as John du Pont, the fortyish scion of the self-proclaimed 'wealthiest family in America' -- they own Delaware -- calls Tatum and invites him to Foxcatcher, the family estate somewhere in the neighborhood of Washington.To keep it short, Carell acts as wrestling mentor to Tatum and in fact practically adopts him. Carell also gathers a squad of half a dozen promising wrestlers and is going to fund them through the next Olympics, with himself as the head of 'Team Foxcatcher.' He also hires the quietly cheerful Ruffalo but over time comes to resent Ruffalo's bond with Tatum. Carell wants to do all the bonding around here. It leads to tragedy.The film is about as far away from the typical 'docudrama' as you can get. It's imaginative in almost every respect and plaudits are due especially to Bennett Miller, the director, and editors Jay Cassidy, Stuart Levy, and Conor O'Neil who have figured out the precise length to let a scene linger on the screen.The performances of the three principals is unimpeachable. Channing Tatum is first seen as an inarticulate brute, shuffling around in a gym, his eyes cast down as always. He speaks in grunts. True, he's a college graduate (I won't name the university, which must be known for its wrestling team) but we can't help asking whose breath blew out the light within this brain. When he tries to read the word 'philanthropist' it comes out 'philogulist.' Steve Carrell is unforgettable as the rich guy. He's got a schnozz on him like a bald eagle and when he speaks -- or even when he doesn't speak -- he tilts his head back and stares down his nose like William F. Buckley. And that voice, so accommodating, so bland, so pragmatic. When he learns that Ruffalo doesn't want to move to Foxcatcher because his family is now established elsewhere, Carrell asks tonelessly, 'How much does he want?' Nothing is made of it but it tells us a great deal about being rich.I don't know how closely it hews to historical reality. I'd never heard of the case. And it's not easy to figure out the dynamics in the narrative because it isn't spelled out for us, as it would be in a child's ABC book. The writer and director have enough trust in the maturity of the audience to let us figure it out for ourselves.My guess? The mother-dominated rich boy is starved for love. He had one friend in his childhood -- until he discovered that his mother was PAYING the other kid to be a friend. Well, now he's got a whole wrestling team that adores him as their angel. The presence of Ruffalo as the coach who knows what he's about interferes with that paternalistic relationship, not to mention the implicit homoeroticism. Carrell is jealous of Ruffalo.But you're entitled to your own guess. Or make no guess at all and just watch the understated imagery float with such aplomb across the screen. I'm glad I caught it, though it didn't unleash a love of wrestling. Where I grew up it was all schoolyard fist fights and bloody noses. Like Vanessa Redgrave as the starchy old mother, we'd have considered wrestling a 'low sport.'",8,3,4,23 September 2015
Lawrence of Arabia," Who, me? Neurotic?
","When this film was released in 1962 I was seeing a shrink. Nothing serious, just the usual ontological Angst. You know, 'What's it all about?' 'Why have I developed this sudden taste for houseflies?' When I described my torment to him he tilted his head and asked, 'Have you seen Lawrence of Arabia'? Okay, this film has been analyzed to death, and with good reason. It's one of the best films ever made. David Lean has a way of doing things, and he's never done it better than here. 'The Bridge on the River Kwai' may be more watchable, if you're not in a patient mood, but isn't -- couldn't be -- more thought provoking.Every role seems played to perfection. Peter O'Toole is a marvelous Lawrence, Homeric and naive. Anthony Quayle, Jack Hawkins, Alec Guiness, all do their best, which is more than good enough. Each is a jewel of a performance. I don't think I've ever watched a funnier scene than the change on politician Claude Raines' face when Hawkins, as General Allenby of the British Army, tells Lawrence that the British have no ambitions in Arabia. Lawrence accepts his word. Raines is sipping champagne and his eyes drift upwards and his mouth purses with amused disbelief -- how could anybody like Lawrence be so damned stupid? The editing is unimpeachable. Everyone applauds Stanley Kubrick for his cut in '2001: A Space Odyssey', when the bone flung in the air becomes a space ship. It's like the moment at which the clucking chicken turns into a guitar in 'Sergeant Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band.' But there's a more quiet and equally effective cut here, when T. E. Lawrence in Cairo blows out a match and in the blink of an eye we are watching a crimson sun rise over a desert horizon so flat and blank it looks drawn with a ruler.If you want an isolated example of good writing and direction, watch the scene in which Lawrence and his men derail a passenger train and shoot it full of holes, killing everyone aboard. Lawrence shouts a cease fire, but his Arabs pay no attention and continue to riddle the cars. He runs out in front of them, shouting, but they still fire on the train. It takes two flares to get them to come to a ragged stop. That's the way real life generally is -- messy, chaotic, and with a jagged edge. Then compare this with a similar scene in 'Khartoum,' made shortly afterwards. During a battle, every extra follows direction and obeys every order at once, running and riding from place to place like figures in a video game. I won't even bring up more recent 'epics' like 'Pearl Harbor' and 'Titanic.' The most tragic moment doesn't involve death but Lawrence's disillusionment. When his plans for Arabian independence collapse, he's called in for a final conference with General Allenby. His expression is vacuous, far away, his voice distant and distracted. As he turns to leave, Prince Faisal says to him, 'Of course, what I OWE you' -- and there is a quick shot Lawrence turning to leave the room -- 'is beyond evaluation.' But the next shot, lasting a second, is only of Lawrence's back swiftly disappearing through the curtain. How easy it would have been for a director less thoughtful than Lean, less respectful of the audience, to have Lawrence stop in the doorway -- give us a close up here -- turn back to Faisal and clearly state some sort of fateful exit line: 'You're all hypocrites,' or 'Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn,' or something. Then leave, while trumpets of triumph blare. Instead Lawrence gets in a truck and leaves the dust and the camels and the Arabs, unimportantly, dismally, heart-breakingly, behind.",10,5,10,29 December 2001
Legend," Fooled.
","I sat through the entire film without realizing that Tom Hardy was playing the roles of both brothers -- crooked but handsome Reggie Krey and brutal and deformed Ron Krey, both of whom made headlines in England for their thieving ways.It's well acted -- on everyone's part, including Emily Browning as the tiny girl friend of handsome Reggie, who is thrown out of her parents' home for hanging around with gangsters.The Kreys build up their criminal empire, we're meant to understand, although the film is nowhere near as didactic as Martin Scorcese's movies about gangsters. The methods by which the brothers and their gang acquire their ill-gotten goods is more referred to than displayed.I have to hand it to Tom Hardy though. Reggie is a familiar character in films, the villainous hood who loves a good woman. But Ron is some kind of hulking mutant with a mouth like a limpet, so ugly that if his face were a building it would be condemned. When that repugnant face is bashed in during a fist fight, he stumbles to his feet and wanders around, dripping blood, emitting feral howls. The performance is startling.",7,0,0,20 September 2016
Behind The Candelabra," Personae
","'Mala Noche' may have given us an equally convincing picture of gay life and exploitation on the streets, but this one takes us into the upper reaches of celebrity. It's believable and grotesque.I'm surprised that it was based on a book 'by' Scott Thorson, Liberace's young lover with whom he had a falling out. The reason I'm surprised is that the film, which I'd have expected to be something like 'Sugar Daddy Dearest', in fact portrays Liberace as a pathetic, sometimes almost saintly, old queen, while Scott Thorson changes from a young naif into a greedy Frankenstein's monster. Until the last scene, that is, when he has an epiphany and realizes what a truly nice guy his keeper was.Well, we've seen love stories between wealthy older men and younger inamoratas ending in bitterness before. Robert DeNiro and Sharon Stone in 'Casino' were more rambunctious in their separation. And Orson Welles and Dorothy Comingore were more ambiguous in 'Citizen Kane.' This flick follows the same trajectory, yet it's an important film for a number of reasons, aside from the splendid budget. One is that Michael Douglas does a magnificent impression of Liberace, believe it or not. And it's a wise career move. It's the first time we've seen him as anything other than an ordinary bourgeois, his first character role. It's a sagacious choice because Douglas is now a little too old for the usual leads in action or romantic movies. Only occasionally does he go a bit over the top -- not in his lines but in his non-verbal behavior, a little too much fluttering of hands, one mince more than is called for.And Matt Damon is equally good as the loyal subordinate who becomes the petulant pet. A bisexual (he claims), he begins as an assistant dog wrangler in Hollywood movies, and winds up living in luxury, sipping wine from a tulip glass while naked in Liberace's jacuzzi. Then his increasing use of speed appears to drive him to excesses of an abusive kind, although I suspect that's just a pat explanation for a guy who became greedier as time passed. He has a face lift at Liberace's suggestion and he's not at all turned off by the notion, except that he insists a dimple be put in his chin, like Cary Grant or Michael's father.The homosexuality isn't bothersome. There is some nudity and some non-explicit depictions of unnatural connections, but so what? We've all been there, one way or another. What makes the film so revolting is the rococo life style that Liberace has chosen for himself with his millions, and the way Damon apparently is awed by it, and the way Liberace himself seems to think it deserves public approbation. 'These columns are real Roman -- ionic.' As the chauffeur Damon is dressed in the outfit of a comic book hero with silver boots. If you thought that the tastes of Frank Sinatra or Elvis Presley were as bad as it gets, you need to see this.The viewer should keep in mind that this is what's called a 'topical biography.' It deals with the relationship between Liberace and Scott. The means some scandalous events are ablated, such as the woman Liberace used as a beard, who, in thrall of hypothetical imperatives, later sued his behind off.It's competently directed by Soderbergh. The photography layers over almost every scene with pale gold and ivory, giving the impression of viewing an object suspended in an aspic made if Tang. The director steps wrong only twice. A couple of times the camera wobbles and zooms in and out of focus, a repellent fad that I hope is now on its way into the dustbin of history. And the end is a cop out. At Liberace's funeral service, Damon sits in the congregation, evidently in his original persona, no longer a bleached blond with a face permanently altered into a demonic mask. Liberace may not have gone out with much style, but his lover does.There was, by the way, a terrific legal battle over the possession of Liberace's corpse, each jurisdiction crying for the celebrity that would go with holding onto the dead body. Brushed aside in the film, it's the sort of petty battle that makes someone like Liberace look perfectly representative of the human race.",Null,2,5,2 June 2013
Gone Girl," Cry For The Camera.
","Ben Affleck is apparently a happily married man who returns home one afternoon to find the living room is a mess, there are blood spots on the wall, and his wife, Rosamund Pike, is gone. The police force of the small Indiana town investigate and find that the kidnapping was staged. Their suspicions naturally fall on the husband and he is battered in the news. Everyone wants a quick solution.The suspicions are heightened when the wife's half-burned diary shows entries indicating that the marriage was failing and that she was scared to death her husband was going to kill her. Affleck is charged, hires a media-savvy lawyer.The case has become one of those nationwide incidents like O. J. Simpson's, in which everyone follows events daily and has made judgments about Affleck's guilt -- all to the effect that he murdered his wife, of course. The TV cameras have been rolling throughout and the reporters are an unruly horde. Affleck's personality is dissected by a Nancy-Grace figure on television. The audience is especially gleeful when Affleck reveals that he has been schtupping one of his students at the community college where he teaches.It's absolutely sensational (but a little confusing to the media's narrative) when his wife finally returns, bloodied but not unbowed, claiming she really WAS kidnapped, abused, and had to kill her abductor to free herself. She's dressed only in a blood-soaked nightgown and she collapses in her husband's arms on the lawn, while the cameras roll and everyone gasps with delight.Well, the whole plot is really too complicated to explain. It's a somber story and nobody emerges guilt free. On the audio commentary, the director seems self confident, maybe too much so. ('F*** you,' he announces to some of his critics.) But it's a useful commentary because you learn what the director was getting at, even if it doesn't come across vividly on the screen.The gap is understandable. The director, like the writer, knows what's going on because, after all, he's READ THE SCRIPT and knows how it will all turn out. But the catch is that, knowing all this, the director is liable to project his knowledge and assume that the audience is more sophisticated than it actually is. In other words, the 'hints' and forshadowings are minimal and don't get past the viewer's apperceptive apparatus. Dave -- we're stupid.The film focuses on the malleable and naive Affleck and the manipulative and morally bankrupt Pike. Marriage is like a deck of cards. In the beginning all you need is two hearts and a diamond. By the end you wish you had a club and a spade. Affleck seems honestly in love, while Pike is manipulative. As Jorge Luis Borges said, 'To fall in love is to create a religion that has a fallible god.'But I'd prefer to read it as a comment on the media. Here is a complex, small-scale, interpersonal event and the media turn it into a morality play that reverses the roles of victims and the perpetrator. Pike, the murderess, becomes the abused heroine of the tale. Affleck, the simple minded dupe, has revealed all of his weaknesses and peccadilloes in television interviews.Well, as any member of the viewing audience will tell you, he doesn't deserve a wonderful woman like Pike. The audience doesn't even have to think about the moral calculus. It's given to them by the price of a TV dish.The reason I see this as perhaps the most important 'message' of the film is that it's happening now, every day, and not just with regard to such personal transgressions and murder and sexual abuse but to issues of fundamental import, like politics. Led on by television, our opinions precede the analysis. I'm for a 'strong' dollar. And why? No TV personality has ever told me I shouldn't. I like the word 'strong' when it applies to anything American. Please don't confuse me with a lot of complicated junk about imports and exports. If it's 'American' it's got to be 'strong.' I'll give away a part of the ending. Except for the fact that Affleck and Pike will now probably become rich as a consequence of the TV movie and the books, nothing much changes.",6,0,5,7 June 2015
Django Unchained," Revenge.
","I enjoyed this action/comedy movie because I hated the evil doers and wanted to see them die because of their brutal natures. I reveled in their pain. And that's the problem.I'm going along about half way on this one because the performances are as good as they are and I can appreciate Quentin Tarantino's collegial sense of humor. Two 'Django's' shaking hands. Brunhilde and Siegfried coming out of nowhere. A musical score that is an homage to Ennio Morricone. The surprises that pop out of a man's mouth or his sleeve.Tarantino's earlier stuff was pretty good -- 'Reservoir Dogs', 'Pulp Fiction' -- and 'Jackie Brown' was finely written and directed, a very nice piece of work. The 'Kill Bills' was far too stylized for me.'Inglourious Basterds' was a disappointment. It was much more violent than anything else he's done, and instead of comic internal conflicts, he'd chosen as villains the Nazis, the most evil people of the century, and their torture and murder could be endorsed without chagrin by the least sophisticated of us, the kind who think 'Don't just kill the enemy; torture them before killing them.' It was a kind of pornography for the millions.He's followed the same course here and I didn't like it much. Given the depraved character of the slave-owning Southerners, no punishment is too harsh, so Django can kill helpless and unarmed people -- including women -- at will. As a hero, the character of Django is not just flawed but practically turned inside out. Superman was a hero Roy Rogers was a hero. Django was a walking abattoir, savagely killing everyone he disliked -- and Tarantino has provided him with a the simple-minded excuse of hating that 'peculiar institution.' I don't want him as my hero. He's too Old Testament for me.The performances are good, though, and the production values high. Jamie Foxx has about two notes on his instrument but Christoph Waltz does a great job as the German bounty hunter. His accent doesn't sound German at all. It sounds like it came from somewhere in outer space. And Don Johnson is surprisingly chipper and colorful as Big Daddy, the plantation owner who gets splashily offed by Django's powerful rifle. (The squibbs seem to have had double charges.) Tarantino obviously has a lot of talent and a keen sense of humor. I wish he'd get back to his roots and lay off the easy targets.",6,2,4,7 February 2015
The Lives of Others," The Walls Have Ears.
","Sebastian Koch, the central figure -- well, one of the central figures -- is a talented actor with one of those plausible European faces and demeanors. He's not gruffly sexy like George Clooney. He's not smoothly handsome like Tom Cruise. He has utility features that can take any part that requires a sympatico character.In 'The Lives of Others' he's a playwright in the 1980s stuck on the wrong side of the Berlin Wall, haunted by the Stasi, the State Security Police, because the possibility exists in the minds of authorities that he and any other artists must secretly harbor dissident thoughts, and we can't have that.So the Stasi plant bugs all over his apartment and install a monitor in the cellar, Hauptmann Gerd Wiesler, who signs his reports 'HGW'.The authorities are right, in a way. Koch and his live-in girl friend and star actress in his plays, do have a lot of politically active visitors. Pretty soon, Wiesler, that joyless cellar rat, is witness to all kinds of subversive conversational exchanges in addition to frequent 'vigorous intimate events.' But a strange thing happens. Wiesler, an almost stereotypical bad guy who never smiles or cracks a joke, begins to change as a consequence of looking into the unrestrained life of artists and intellectuals. It's like the Heisenberg principle in reverse. Observing the object results in a change in the observer. And Wiesler starts altering his reports, leaving out any suspicious conversations, listening raptly to Koch's piano playing a moody and elegant piece written by a friend and titled 'Sonata for a Good Man.'There isn't space to outline the entire plot, which is deliberately paced and clearly not intended for kids munching popcorn and getting high on energy drinks. You have to have patience for events to unfold. And unfold they do, with increasing rapidity, until there are some exceedingly tense searches for hidden objects, some self-indulgent squealing on the part of people who shouldn't squeal, and penultimately a cothurnal accident and the death of someone who has been squeezed beyond endurance by the state.In the denouement, some years after the wall falls, Koch decides to look up his own Stasi file in the archives. There he learns the truth. Every guilty move that he, his lover, and his friends made, was overheard by Wiesler, the pale slug downstairs, who decided to save Koch's Speck. The pages of the report are signed merely 'HGW XXVII.' But Koch is inspired to find out the name and identity of his underground friend and savior, although he doesn't contact him.In the final scene, Wiesler, now a humble mailman dragging himself through the graffiti-ridden slums, wanders into a book store and locates Koch's new book, 'Sonata for a Good Man: A Novel.' The dedication reads: 'To HGW.' The clerk asks if Wiesler would like the purchase gift wrapped and Wiesler, without expression, replies, 'No. It's for me.' I found that ending both clarifying and emotionally moving. There were no more loose ends.It's a powerful film. I recommend it but, as I say, it requires some attention, especially for the first third, which moves along slowly. The last half picks up. If you make it that far, you probably won't want to leave it without seeing the end.",7,2,5,6 January 2010
Good Will Hunting," Manipulative and Heartwarming
","SPOILERS. I can see why this project was greenlighted. It's got everything a Hallmark feature should have -- plus profanity. A love story between a brilliant lower-class boy and a young girl at Harvard. (In the original 'Love Story' it was more or less the other way around.) A tortured boy barely out of his teens who is a miscreant and unable to expose himself to others and who is not 'in touch with his feelings.' (I've always wondered how you get in touch with your feelings.) Well, it's worked dozens of times before -- 'Blood Brothers,' 'David and Lisa,' inter alia. In this instance he's wary of others because he was abused as a child; cf., any of two or three dozen Lifetime Movies for Women. A very human but somewhat remote academic mentor, and a warm, humanistic, unpretentious bearded shrink, as in 'Ordinary People.' A score that tells us when we're supposed to laugh and when we're supposed to tear up. Good, evocative location shooting in Boston. Is Will Hunting going to be able to overcome his fear of commitment, leave Beantown, and find himself emotionally and intellectually? (How do you find yourself?) We viewers want him so badly to choose the right path, which we can discern amidst the murky and myriad possibilities even if he can't, that we feel like we're watching someone trying to shove a boulder and we find ourselves sitting in our seats and humping along with him. Does he make the right choice? Does a bear hibernate in the winter?Well, I'm sorry. I kind of enjoyed the first half hour or so, when Will Hunting's genius is being finally and painfully uncovered. It was kind of confusing though, in a technical sense. Mathematics is one of those creative talents that appears at an early age, rather like genius in music. It tends to peter out in early adulthood. (If you haven't made it as a professional mathematician by the time you're twenty-five you're considered over the hill in academia.) In other words, mathematical genius has a life course of its own, almost, but not quite, independent of what is generally recognized as 'intelligence.' But Matt Damon, as Will Hunting, not only has this isolated talent, but something that resembles a photographic memory as well. He's remembered practically everything he's ever read, which is practically everything ever written, from law to organic chem, although we never see him reading a book. If a kid in my working-class neighborhood ever was caught reading Nietzsche, he'd be twitted to death. Well, eidetic imagery (or photographic memory) really does exist. You can hold up an ordinary comb in front of a kid who 'has' it, for a few seconds, then put the comb out of sight and the kid will be able to tell you the number of teeth in the comb, because the image in his mind is so clear that he can count them. But, like musical or mathematical genius, it shows up early, in young kids, then tends to fade. And again, it's independent of ordinary intelligence. For one individual, especially at the age of twenty-one, to have both singular geniuses at the same time, is so unlikely as to constitute an irritation for someone watching the flick. I mean, it's like drawing two straight flushes, one after the other. And then too, it makes me squirm when I watch a scene in which a shrink brings up the abuse his client suffered in childhood and then tells him over and over (and over), 'It's not your fault,' until the client breaks into a cascade of fulsome sobs and the two of them hug one another like Esalen grads. Who ever claimed it was the client's fault in the first place? Why in God's name should the client blame himself for the brutality instead of the foster fathers who are the guilty parties here? (Hint: the script calls for it.) And there are shouted arguments between the academic mentor -- played in a most engaging way by Skarsgard -- and the humanistic shrink -- done devilishly by Robin Williams -- that seem to take place only because they add texture to the picture. Neither the mathematician or the shrink show the slightest evidence of being the shouting type. There's also a shouted argument between Will and his girl friend that isn't called for either, although a simple disagreement would have been plausible. I guess what I'm saying is that this is a commercial product. It could have come out of a course in screen writing taken through Phoenix University. Introduce interesting characters with idiosyncratic traits, pull the audience in, then tug at the plot and the heartstrings. Have a scene in which an emotionally distant person finally breaks down and cries. In the last half of the movie, when the interest may be dying down, pump it up with fights between people we like. This isn't meant as cynicism or a blanket condemnation of the talent involved in the production. Matt Damon is particularly good as a bragging roughnecked Southie. Contrast this performance with what he does in 'The Talented Mister Ripley.' When he and Williams have a quiet confrontation on a park bench, Damon gives the scene entirely to the shrink. Robin Williams does a fine imitation of Oliver Sacks. (Why does he choose so many other poor vehicles?) Van Sandt handles the direction competently, but see 'Drugstore Cowboys' for a more personal Weltanschauung, in some ways just the opposite of the one presented here. It isn't nearly as heartwarming as 'Good Will Hunting,' thank Bog.",6,6,14,31 May 2003
The Secret Life of Walter Mitty," Making The Scene.
","Oh, how I dreaded watching this. There was Thurber's pat little short story of a nobody who is bossed around by everybody and who daydreams fiercely in order to compensate for his nothingess. It's just right for a short story. The boredom alternates with the adventure and it all ends on time and as it should. MGM had a crack at it back in the 40s with Danny Kaye, a full-length feature, and of course it didn't work. The fantasies didn't seem so funny on screen and were gotten out of the way in the first half hour to make room for a routine and funnier crime plot.And now -- Hollywood presents another remake, no doubt filled with Ben Stiller's exploits in the world of computer-generated images. Ben Stiller as Man Mountain Dean conquering the Greys from outer space. Stiller besting Boulder Dam with legs and becoming Heavyweight Champion of the World. Stiller singlehandedly saving the planet from God only knows what pot pourri of gangsters, geological threats, and mad scientists. Explosions, roiling clouds of black smoke, swords thrust into torsos, groans of agony. I forced myself to watch it as penance for an impure thought I'd had as a one year old child.But no. Stiller has directed Steve Conrad's screenplay with an eye to an audience above the Mental Age of twelve. Stiller is Mitty, not so much bored as socially ineffective, a little cowed by all the transactions taking place around him. He can't seem to get a hit on eHarmony. (Lots of product placement.) There are few fantasies and they're over with quickly. And he's trying to make his presence known to a colleague at the dying 'Life Magazine,' Kristen Wiig, who sometimes seems almost as uncertain of herself as Stiller is of himself. Still, she inspires him. From a nobody with a nothing past, he leaps around the world in pursuit of the famous photographer who has taken the last and most earth-shaking photograph of his career for the final issue of 'Life.' Only the photographer seems to have forgotten to hand the negative over to Stiller, who is in charge of 'Negative Assets.' There's Iceland, Greenland, and Afghanistan, with people playing games you can't pronounce. As I remember from an anthropology course, one of the games shown on screen, a version of soccer, is far more tame than the description I read. But no matter.It's Stiller's story, sometimes pensive, sometime quite amusing, about the rise in his blood testosterone level. It never goes out of bounds nor does the movie, which is in fact not bad at all.",7,1,1,18 October 2016
Schindler's List," A moving story.
","Steven Spielberg, until the appearance of this film, was rightly noted mainly for his child's view of movies, fast action, easy sentiment, and a generally accurate sense of appeal to fantasy and wish fulfillment. He pretty much discarded that sort of innocence here, without leaving behind his appreciation of the commercial value of a story.It's impossible not to be deeply moved. The extermination program of the Nazis was the most horrific offense to human morality of the 20th century, and one of the worst in history. It wasn't the worst of the slaughters. The two world wars qualified for those honors. It wasn't even the worst example of ethnic cleansing, as it's come to be called. But more than six million Jews and more than seven million other undesirables -- homosexuals, the mentally ill, gypsies, political dissidents -- perished in the camps and not a single Jewish family in Europe went untouched. And it wasn't a war in which the victims were fighting back. It was a deliberate and very thorough act of genocide on the part of a people that Madame de Stael once described as 'a nation of poets and dreamers.'It's a kind of 'cross-over' movie in which the protagonist is not Jewish but rather a Christian who comes to their rescue. A basically decent man comes to his senses. This is the formula, whether the despised and abused minority are Jews or African-Americans. If it were otherwise, there would be a danger of this being seen somehow as a 'Jewish' movie by the unenlightened masses and, as a consequence, might suffer at the box office. Better 'In the Heat of the Night' than 'Superfly.' But Spielberg has avoided most of the clichÃ©s associated with films of the final solution. No voice overs telling us of the suffering. No stock footage of bull dozers plowing corpses into mass graves. For the most part, the story stays at the personal level. (We hear hardly anything of the progress of the war.) And it's at this level that the film excels, due to the mature script and the performances of Liam Neeson, Ben Kingsley and Ralph Feinnes. There are many other characters, including Embeth Davidtz.The film is good because Neason's character begins not as a racist or a humanitarian but as a moral nihilist. He cares about nothing but money and the sensory pleasures it affords. He couldn't care less about the Jews, or about the Nazis either for that matter. The war to him is just a way of making a profit using cheap labor. And the script rises above the formulaic in not giving him a moment of epiphany. At no point does his brow furrow, his eyes light up, and he thinks to himself, 'My God, what am I doing?' Nope. Instead, his development is informed by minor but important insights distributed here and there. After the surrender, he leaves the camp as a fugitive, dressed in prison clothes, mourning his carelessness in not saving more lives.Spielberg tells the story in a straightforward way but of course some incidents and dialog from events of fifty years ago must be fabricated. And the fabrications are well done. Especially enjoyable is the touchy, sometimes abrasive, and often humorous relationship between Neason, the salesman and con man who simply has no head for business, and Ben Kingsley as the matter-of-fact accountant who does. I'd give examples of some exchanges but there isn't space.Spielberg hasn't quite gotten over his taste for easy sentimentality. There are only two touches of color in this black-and-white movie. A little girl in a rose-colored coat appears two or three times, so that we can know who it is when her body is wheeled past in a barrow, just another victim. And when the workers hold a ceremony on Shabat, the candle flames are touched with a warm orange that signifies life. Effective, yes, but unnecessary in an adult film like this. Most people watching the film may be trusted to know what's going on without being nudged. But that's small stuff. Somewhat more embarrassing is a scene in which a German officer screams like a maniac and makes gargoyle faces at the camera after emptying his pistol into a mountain of burning bodies. Are we supposed to learn from this that the people running the camps were evil? The Nazi's extermination program prompted many studies in social science, none of which has contributed much to our understanding of why this, and similar programs, seem to be so common around the world. It's easy enough to blame Germany and the SS, but what happened in Kosovo, Maylasia, Cambodia, and Rwanda? Perhaps one of the reasons we've never really understood it is that we don't want to. Perhaps the answer lies not in 'F' (for 'facism') scales or ideographic studies of power but in the darkest aspects of human nature itself. Is there a group of people who have nothing in common but their ethnic identity that we ourselves would enjoy seeing wiped off the map? We all have massive cerebral cortices, much of the functions of which seem devoted to damping down impulses from structures lower down on the brain that generate desires to mate, to flee from danger, and to kill things and people that get in our way. Some day science might give us an answer but until then we have to rely on poets like Robert Burns.'Many and sharp the num'rous ills Inwoven with our frame! More pointed still we make ourselves Regret, remorse, and shame! And Man, whose heav'n-erected face The smiles of love adorn, - Man's inhumanity to man Makes countless thousands mourn!",8,30,51,23 October 2007
Across the Universe," You Can Still Find the Scattered Limbs of the Poet.
","'Invenias disjecti membra poetæ.' The scattered remains that Horace referred to are pretty much found here. Julie Taymor's film just about captures most of 1967 and 1968, illustrated in a thin but socially relevant story linking some Beatles songs of the period. The songs are the thing. They're not the original releases, which we can now hear rendered peppily in WalMart by a thousand and one singing violins. These are fresh, more grand arrangements backed by choirs of cherubim. We see the jarring anti-war protests, the celestial calm of what passes for love among teens, doomed simulacra of Janis Joplin and Jimmi Hendrix and Timothy Leary, the real Martin Luther King, Jr., and the real Walter Cronkite broadcasting King's murder. The songs include some of the less well known numbers, Prudence, as well as some of the overly familiar, Jude. The arrangements sometimes bring out a wistful beauty that was hidden in the original. 'Give My Heart' is rendered more slowly and sung by a pure soprano. The tempo is slower and the electric guitars downplayed so that the silken harmonies become more apparent.The Beatles were mostly a funny joke when they first appeared on the pop scene, with 'I Want to Hold Your Hand.' Some joke. After each of their albums, I was convinced that they'd shot their wad, that no improvement was possible given this increasingly loose-limbed approach, light years away from 'I Want to Hold Your Hand.' They continued to confound me. Today, I find it difficult to listen to the tunes since they evoke some memories that are, after all, tragic. I can't hear Lennon singing 'they're gonna crucify me.'The direction and imagery are not light-hearted like 'Yellow Submarine,' and the directorial tricks are not exactly psychedelic in the sense of, say, Peter Max. Overall, it's a rather dark movie. The Vietnam War hovers over the whole thing and sometimes we are snatched away to Southeast Asia for a brief visit to the battlefield. The images are in fashionable high contrast and mostly rather gloomy, not in the spirit of Lennon et all but more in the sensibilities of today when the country or indeed the world seems wrapped in a nebulous hatred that is at least as intense now as it was then.I can't think of an audience for a movie like this. For those in the age bracket we think of as most involved with pop music, the social and political issues are strictly of historical interest. They weren't born yet. And the music, I would guess, is imaginative enough to be a daunting challenge. But those who lived through that window in time are likely to be prosperous burghers by now, resentful of today's reckless and self-satisfied youth -- or perhaps youth in general. Kids today (he said creakingly) don't seem to be exploring, let alone experimenting. They already appear jaded without having gone through florescence.It's a better flick than I'd expected. I thought it would be another exploitation of whatever box-office appeal the Beatles had left, but it's clearly more ambitious than that. A lot of effort has gone into the production and a lot of money and it deserves a decent return on both.",7,1,2,28 February 2009
Stardust," Don't You Believe It.
","You'll find this hard to believe, but right next to England there is a walled-off kingdom called Erewhon or Shangri-La or something which, having sealed itself off from the world, remains in the Middle Ages. A young Englishman (Cox) is sent into this benighted place to retrieve a star that has fallen inside the walls. The star turns into Claire Danes, whose astral qualities reside in her emerald necklace. The three sinister sisters (Michelle Pfeiffer in various stages of old-age make up) who have magical powers. There are numerous subplots involving the heir to the throne, a desperate mother, a unicorn, and other characters. The story is accompanied by an epic orchestral score.Something like that, anyway. The story is a lot of episodic whimsy with CGIs used judiciously for effect, for a change. There is comedy and there is an abundance of action.Award for the best performance, not counting the lovestruck boy and the beautiful Danes, is Robert DeNiro as the mean pirate captain who is secretly gay. He claps his hands with glee. He outfits Cox with new clothes and squeals, 'Oh, that's tres YOU!' He does Cox's hair. He's captured when his enemies find him in a corset, doing a fan dance in front of the mirror.Michelle Pfeiffer hasn't been seen much lately, which is too bad because she looks fine. Claire Danes is attractive too, with large fleshy features. When she grins, even her teeth look enticingly big. Her bite would tingle nicely. She's a good actress too. To these alien ears, her British accent is reasonably convincing. Cox is boyishly appropriate to the role and if he doesn't shoot out the lights, well, he gets the job done.It's not worth going on about. It's no masterpiece but it is diverting. I don't follow the Harry Potter stories or anything like them, never having got past 'The Wizard of Oz.' This movie just happened to come up on the channel I'd been watching and I was too lazy to turn it off while I did some reading. But I followed it all the way through.",6,0,4,24 January 2013
The Elephant Man," One of Us.
","This has to be the only totally straight movie that David Lynch ever put his fingers on. And at that, it's not entirely straight, but it seldom edges into Lynch's private vision, or through the looking glass, or down the rabbit hole, or into The Garden of Earthly Delights or the ghoul-haunted woodland of Weir, or wherever it is that his other films, beginning with 'Eraserhead', have voyaged into.I should note that all of David Lynch's movies are eerie and ominous, but that the atmosphere isn't created by directorial fireworks. The techniques are classical -- no instant cutting, no slow motion, no ghoulish colors, no funny camera work, although the lens may occasionally plumb the auditory canal of a severed ear. Instead, what makes his work exception is his control of the images and sound. The art direction, set decoration, the architecture and textures, and the sound are as filled with impact as the story itself. It's a sentimental and ultimately tragic story naturally. John Merrick, the elephant man of the title, was a rude lump of foul deformity, a simulacrum of a human being. What else could they do, turn it into a comedy? A werewolf movie? John Hurt is Merrick, kept in thrall by Bytes (Freddie Jones) who exhibits him to the public in a freak show in Victorian London. Merrick is rescued by Dr. Frederick Treves (Anthony Hopkins) who sneaks him into a hospital run by Carr Gomm (John Gielgud) where he is tended by nurses who are frightened of him. All the nurses except their chief, Mothershead. Mothershead is enacted by a starchy Wendy Hiller.Here's how a director with a case of arrested aesthetic development and a craving for commercial success would have first revealed the hideous half-human that was John Merrick. Generic suspense music, please. A frightened nurse open Merrick's door, she drops the plates and shrieks while the camera zooms into her terrified face. Then -- a cut, and the camera whips up to Merrick's deformed face, accompanied by a loud, dissonant sting on the sound track -- WHAMMMMM! Not here though.Gradually the staff come to realize that despite his disfigurement, Merrick is really a sweet and gentle soul, forgiving and grateful for the smallest of kindnesses. Warmth replaces fear. And when Treves takes Merrick home to meet his wife (Hannah Gordon), this caprice of nature begins to sob quietly, saying, 'I've never been treated so well by a lovely woman.' Imagine how much worse it could have been. Instead of being barely able to hiss his lines -- instead of producing mediocre sketches -- instead of merely building a model cathedral out of match sticks -- the script could have turned him into a genius! How inspiring? Elephant Man rescued from freak show writes a smash hit Broadway play? Paints the Mona Lisa of 1890? Mentally extends pi to 23 digits in ten seconds? Invents Leggos? No. The only thing Merrick has going for him is his utter joy at being treated humanely. Thank God he's just a nice guy, not a saint.The rest of the principles are frankly splendid. Models of acting, really, with not a sour note being struck. Especially interesting is Hannah Gordon's portrayal of Treve's wife. She's not a dazzling beauty but has one of the most expressive faces on screen. She tells us everything we need to know by just lifting an eyebrow. (What Freddy Jones could have learned from her!) Hannah Gordon doesn't have that much screen time here but catch her, if you can, in 'Miss Morrison's Ghosts,' in which she plays opposite Wendy Hiller, to see a true professional at her best.The director, David Lynch, keeps his act together in this relatively straightforward story but it wouldn't have been made quite this oddly by anyone else. I mean, the film opens with a scene of Merrick's mother being run down and trampled by a herd of screaming, stampeding elephants. What the hell does that have to do with the movie? It's never mentioned in the script. It's certainly not Merrick's fantasy. And there's no reason to believe that his mother really WAS frightened by elephants.Although Lynch doesn't use many tricky codes in the movie, he rarely passes up a chance to show us the grimy perineum of Victorian London -- the basement fires being stoked, the black smoke billowing from the chimney, the intricate reticula of a lace curtain stirring in the open window, the slick wet bricks of an industrializing city gone berserk, the iron webbing across Victoria Station's glass roof. Texture piled on texture, and all of it somehow ominous. He does for man's indifferent artifacts what Peter Weir and Nicholas Roeg did for Australia's natural features. He's invested them with dread.It occurred to me while watching this that Alfred Hitchcock's 'Rear Window' is usually described as drawing the audience into Jimmy Stewart's voyeurism and thus making us as guilty as he is, of snooping into others' lives. What does 'The Elephant Man' do to ITS audience then? Turn us into gawkers at a carnival freak show? I wonder how many of us went to see this movie when it was released, not so much to watch an enjoyable and well-done film, but to see what all the fuss was about? Lynch takes it easy on the audience in that regard. Merrick is horrifyingly deformed but there are no cheap shocks. Lynch gives us his appearance little by little until, by the time we see him in his awesome ugliness, we've gotten to know him a bit and to empathize with him. And why shouldn't we admire and respect him? We may look better than Merrick, but he'd be hard for any of us to beat in a contest of soul against soul.",8,1,1,14 August 2008
I Am Legend," Where is Everybody?
","Never having read Richard Matheson's novel, I can't comment on how closely the movie follows the book. Certainly closer than an earlier transposition, 'The Omega Man.' A doctor seeking a cure for cancer winds up with one that kills everyone instead. A few million people are immune, as can be expected in a genetically diverse population. Most of them turn into fierce 'dark seekers' who have lost all human impulses and only appear at night looking for real people to destroy. The monsters include dogs, but, for some reason, not lions or deer.Will Smith is a doc who is left alone with his German shepherd, Sam, in Manhattan. He lives in an apartment and laboratory overlooking Washington Square and he's working on a cure for the 'cure.' Joined by Alce Braga and her son, who have heard his voice on AM radio, he finally discovers the antivenin and sacrifices his life so that Braga and son can escape to an upstate colony of normal survivors, bringing a vial of the serum with her.It's a brutal, suspenseful, violent, and ultimately depressing movie despite the uplifting ending. All by itself, the thought of monsters hanging around The White Horse Tavern is heart breaking. But, man, these monsters are really something. Some of their humanity may have been lost along with their hair, but they zip around like nobody's business and can fling a grown man across a room with one hand. They make a lot of noise too. And they have no respect for furniture.Alice Braga is a sympatico young woman who tends never to blink, but the movie belongs to Will Smith. It requires a strong performance and I'm not sure Smith is up to the job. He tries hard but the effort shows. And his appearance doesn't help -- those outlandish ears. He can be quite good in thrillers that have a comedic component, as in that one with Gene Hackman, 'State Secret?' Something like that.The monsters attack so relentlessly, so careless of their own welfare, that they butt their skulls against steel and bullet proof glass. They can be stopped by light, by bullets, or by fire, but apparently by nothing else. And it's no use talking to them either.The most wrenching scene in the movie is not when the monsters are attacking but when Smith must strangle the infected Sam, the dog he loves and who has been his only companion and helpmate. The director wisely keeps the camera on Smith's face during this ordeal. In the first half of the film, Smith does a lot of talking to Sam and that's good because it allows for exposition. But it does raise questions. When is it alright for a grown man to talk to an animal when the two are otherwise alone? Okay, dogs, anytime. They understand simple commands. They really do. I tried it with a non-English speaking dog in Samoa, switching from English to Samoan, and in each language using a different tone of voice -- angry or friendly. The dog responded to Samoan, regardless of tone. In English, he hadn't a clue. It's kind of okay to talk to cats too. Talking to your plants is supposed to make them flourish but I doubt it. One night, making clam chowder, I found myself apologizing to each living bivalve as I dropped it into the boiling broth. That's when I decided I'd better get a dog.Anyway, I was sorry to see Sam go, but I wasn't really sad when the movie ended. It's long, fast, and expensive, and a bit tiring. It keeps your interest, no doubt about it, and isn't lacking in intelligence. (The events of the past are revealed gradually in small increments.) But, all in all, not worth a second viewing.",6,3,4,6 October 2008
Dog Day Afternoon," Outstanding Drama.
","The 1960s were a period of innovation in movies, what with the French nouvelle vague and 'A Hard Day's Night' and psychedelic influences and everybody stoned and all that. But the 1970s were better. The raw chaos of the antinomian 60s was shaped and formed into structured narratives that were polished and disciplined. A number of great or nearly great film were produced, a surprising number of them dealing with criminal activity in one or another form -- 'The Godfather', 'Chinatown,' 'Serpico.' 'Dog Day Afternoon' is one of the best of them, the story of bisexual Al Pacino and his incredibly dim compadre John Cazale who are discovered while trying to hold up a bank in Brooklyn They take the bank's employees hostage and are undone while attempting their escape.There isn't a sour note in any of the performances, down to the atmosphere people. Charles Durning is the frustrated NYPD negotiator who shouts himself hoarse and is almost driven mad while trying to accommodate Pacino on the one hand and the demands of his superiors and the FBI on the other.Pacino is in top form as the fundamentally decent guy who is trying to get the money for his male wife's sex change operation, and Chris Sarandon is superb in the tough role of the male wife who now wants nothing to do with Pacino. Sarandon must walk a thin line between the suggestion of homosexuality and a parody of it, and he pulls it off perfectly in his speech and gestures. (His hands have long painted fingernails and he clutches his hospital robe close to his throat.) The phone conversation between Sarandon, in a barber shop, and Pacino in the bank across the street, is priceless. When Sarandon is first brought in, the barber shop is jammed with cops and FBI agents, and Durning is solemnly questioning Sarandon about the relationship. Sarandon confesses that he went to a psychiatrist who told him that he 'was a woman trapped in a man's body.' At that, one of the cops in the background who has been trying to suppress a smile all along, snickers out loud, and Durning flicks him an angry glance out of the corners of his eyes for a few seconds. It's superbly done. An instant more of the glance would have been too much, and an instant less too little. Applause for the editor.Everything comes out just right. The ending is tragic but inevitable and perhaps even justified. The viewer is likely to become so wrapped up in the likable Pacino and his dilemmas that he forgets that Cazale has an automatic weapon and is entirely ready to kill with it.A marvelous job all around.",8,1,2,21 April 2009
Amadeus," Green Eyed Monsters.
","There's a scene near the beginning when we are first being introduced to the horny and slightly zany Mozart (Hulce), when he enters the court of the Austrian Emperor, surrounded by outlandishly attired royalty, couturiers, chatelains, stewards, Knights of the Round Table, personal trainers, and shoe shine boys. The Court Composer, Salieri (Abraham), admires the twenty-six year old Mozart with a passion and has written a little tune to celebrate his arrival at the court.Mozart is pleased and flattered. He asks if he can play it at the piano. He sits down and plays the simple ditty. Then, listening intently, he hits one of the chords again and again, and asks, 'That's a little off, don't you think? Shouldn't it go like this?' Then he rips through the tune, deconstructs it, and does to it what Sonny Rollins did to 'I'm An Old Cowhand' and Stan Getz did to 'Autumn in New York.' Salieri looks on. His smile slowly fades into a frown. And the plot is set in motion. Salieri has slaved all his life to become a composer, driven by his love of music, in spite of his poor background and a father whose discouragements were strenuous.And here is this young punk, prodded on by a stern musician father, performing as a child before royalty, a prodigy, giggling maniacally, mocking him, rippling along and making Salieri's tune sound like something children might sing in Kindergarten.Salieri hates Mozart for being everything that Salieri is not. He plots against him, tries to knee-cap his career, spies on him, makes an attempt to steal his work even when Mozart is on his death bed, expiring in his mid-thirties. Salieri winds up telling the tale in flashback to a priest who visits him in the insane asylum in his old age.The curious thing is that Mozart really WAS a musical prodigy. He could play the piano when he was tall enough to reach the keys. He learned the violin. He wrote a minuet was he was eight and had his first symphony published as a prepubescent boy. A similar skill in mathematics shows up at a similar age. By the time Mozart was my age, he'd been dead for thirty or forty years. It's a sobering thought. Too sobering. Calls for a bit of single malt neat. Hold on a moment.There, that's better. Thank you. Those musical skills are obviously something constitutional. The subsequent opportunities to 'learn' how to do it are adventitious. It's 'curious' because it makes you wonder, if this ability isn't confined to a single culture, how many Mozarts have been born and died unrecognized among, say, the Australian aborigines. Not only didn't they have a stage father. They didn't know what a piano was. They had no instruments at all that allowed one to control the notes being played.It's also 'curious' because neither musical talent nor skill in higher mathematics is measured on any of the usual intelligence tests. Psychologists tend to dismiss these skills as mere 'aptitudes' or 'talents', as if calling them by a dismissive name discounts their importance. (The fact is probably that you can't measure them easily with a pencil and paper test.) Anyway, returning to the film, Abraham deserved his Academy Award, for what it's worth. He's quite good. So is Jeffrey Jones as the Emperor with the impenetrable expression and the eyes of a carp. Hulce and Berridge, who plays Mozart's wife Constanze, look the part but sound like two kids from Sherman Oaks. Hulce has the added disadvantage of speaking like Ryan O'Neal. I'm not certain that semi-deranged cackle was necessary -- we get the picture without it -- but okay.Most of Mozart's music that we see on the screen are excerpts from his operas. I was never a big fan of opera. But I suppose in a big splashy award-winning movie you must fill the screen with colorful display. What's the alternative? Have Mozart sit at the piano and play one of his breathtaking sonatas? Milos Forman must have learned from MTV that you can't even do that with Elton John.",7,0,2,21 February 2012
The Game," Who Dealt This Mess?
","SPOILERS.I think it was Chuang Dz who is supposed to have asked: 'Last night I dreamed I was a butterfly. Today, am I a butterfly dreaming I am a man?'The question, like this movie and many others before it, deals with the problem of distinguishing what is real from what is illusory. An old philosophical question. But this movie does a pretty good job of exploring the issue.The plot, basically is this. Sean Penn enrolls his brother Michael Douglas in something called 'the game.' Douglas enrolls in this program, a birthday present, without having any idea of what it's all about. Douglas is an extremely wealthy control freak who lives a life encased in ice. He's brutal to subordinates, frosty to friends, and lives alone and likes it. Then things begin to go wrong. First little things. His pen leaks and stains his shirt at the airport. A waitress spills wine all over him at his favorite restaurant. A man seems to drop dead in front of him. Then things spin wildly out of control. People shoot at him. His bank accounts are emptied by the people running the game. A wild taxi ride ends up with him trapped in the car at the bottom of San Francisco Bay. He's drugged by someone he trusts and wakes up dressed in rags, his nose bloodied, with no ID and no money, in a rubbish-strewn Mexican graveyard. This has happened to me once or twice and I can tell you -- it's discomfiting. It's like an episode from The Twilight Zone or John Fowles' novel 'The Magus'. Or, citing cinematic history, like the pod people or Carpenter's 'The Thing' or Steve Railsback in 'The Stuntman.' Who belongs to the conspiracy and who doesn't. Or does ANYBODY not belong? And, as a birthday present, this 'game' is like one of those really ugly ties that somebody gives you, that you know you'll never wear, but you can't take it back either.Douglas gives a surprisingly good performance. He has greater range than I'd previously given him credit for. He shows the same disdain for others that he did as Gordon Gekko but he brings a fragility to the character as well. When he sees mouth-to-mouth resuscitation being given to someone he displays what could easily pass for real disgust. And when he cuts his hand on a sliver of glass, he grimaces with pain while he rinses it and wraps it in a handkerchief, the way the adventurer of 'Romancing the Stone' would never do. And there is none of the comfortable matter-of-fact laid back quality he showed as a doctor and boy friend in 'Coma.' The other performers are competent but Douglas has the only role that stands out.Interesting use of location shooting too. San Francisco doesn't look like an urban theme park here. Almost all the scenes take place at night on depopulated streets and they make San Francisco look about as ugly as it's possible to make the city look. The dialog doesn't leap out at you but it does have its quiet wit, which I'm not sure is always appropriate. Douglas loses a shoe to an attack dog. 'There goes a thousand dollars,' he remarks to his companion. 'Your shoes cost a thousand dollars?' she asks. 'That one did.'At the movie's end, just when you think the game is over, there's yet another twist coming, the last one leading Douglas to suicide by jumping off the roof of a high-rise hotel, only to land safely on an air bag judiciously placed below in what looks like the lounge of the Sheraton Palace. The movie is entirely implausible. As explained at the end, there isn't a believable moment in it. But it has the kind of illogic that a real nightmare has. The viewer may realize afterward that what has happened is impossible but Douglas has no way of finding that out. Everything seems askew to him as it does to us while we watch. Even Daniel Schorr on CNN has an interactive exchange with him. 'This is impossible,' says Douglas. 'That's right,' replies Schorr. 'It's impossible. You're having a conversation with your TV set.' If you can't trust Daniel Schorr something is seriously screwed up.Alas, the denouement does flunk the believability test, and badly. Douglas has been put through hell, and it all turns out for the best -- all those dangerous pranks, the living nightmare, the humiliation, the druggings, the action movie clichÃ©s, all have made him 'a better man.' He's grateful. Whereas a lot of fairly normal people, myself included, would try to track down every soul involved in this scam and beat the living crap out of them. I'd make a particular point of celebrating my brother Sean Penn's next birthday by crowning him with a crowbar -- a real one.",6,91,129,2 November 2003
The Man Who Would Be King," Huston Gets It Right, Again
","Sometimes Huston seems to have fallen asleep at the wheel. It's hard to believe that he made a movie like 'Annie' for any reasons other than financial. But his winners are first-rate. I'll only mention 'The Maltese Falcon,' 'The Treasure of the Sierra Madre,' and 'The African Queen' in passing. Hardly anybody seems to be turning out well-crafted work like this anymore, pieces in which plot, character, and atmosphere cohere.'The Man Who Would Be King' is a fine example of Huston at or near his best. It is completely without pretense -- a kind of blustering, masculine, tragicomedy with two superb actors in the leads and fine support by Christopher Plummer as Brother Kipling. Nothing that Caine or Connery feel seems to be more than an inch deep. Stranded on a snowy mountaintop in the Hindu Kush, they sit around a dying campfire discussing how they're going to kill themselves, since they will otherwise slowly freeze to death. 'Let's wait till the fire goes out,' suggests Caine, 'and I'll do the necessary.' Connery muses, 'Peachy, do you think our lives have been misspent?' 'Well,' replies Caine, 'I wouldn't say the world is a better place for our having been IN it.' They start laughing as they reminisce, provoking a life-saving snow avalanche.They are clever, treacherous, greedy, and very human. They've taken a serious vow against the use of women or liquor until they've completed their plan of robbing some remote tribe of natives 'six ways from Sunday.' Learning that they have no interest in sleeping with his daughters, a friendly chieftain suggests that maybe some boys would do the trick, sending the heroes into a Victorian dudgeon.I can't carry on much more about the jokes or about the underlying theme, which is pretty sad. Hubris, the Greeks would have called it, defying the gods and presuming to rise above your station. The lawyers might have called it lex loci. Having been proclaimed king, Connery tells Caine, 'I'll be going now. You mortals remain outside.' Connery breaks his vow where women are concerned and marries the lusciously exotic Roxanne (Caine's wife at the time). The spirit grew ever weaker and the flesh was all too willing.Neither Caine nor Connery has ever disgraced or damaged a movie they've been in, although the reverse hasn't always been the case. They're not exactly heroes here, either. Huston and his writers were unsentimental. The two are racists. Caine throws an affable Indian gentleman off the train -- 'Outside, Baboo!' -- and Huston treats it as a comic incident. That unapologetic lack of political correctness also spares us any nonsense about noble savages. Each of the isolated mountain tribes complains about the next tribe living upstream that they wait until the local women are bathing or doing laundry in the river, then they pee into the river. Offered the title of 'Ootah The Great,' one chief grumbles and says he'd prefer to be known as 'Ootah the Terrible.' It would have been easy to sentimentalize these people, a bit of teaching of Oriental Wisdom, 'a man's reach should not exceed his grasp,' or 'all things in moderation,' or some such nonsense, but we don't get it here. These are pretty rough dudes who play ball with the heads of their enemies.In trying to capitalize on the success of this movie, the company brought out a 'novelization', which turned the screenplay into a novel, as if Kipling had never lived to write the original story. (Talk about barbarism!)I could watch this a hundred times and still marvel at Connery's mastery of the military style of speech when he says lines like, 'There'll be no summary executions in THIS ah-my!' And, 'Sorry about that. Blood was up. Won't happen again.' He does it at least as well as Nigel Greene, Harry Andrews, or Jack Hawkins -- those mess hall terminal contours.Don't miss it.",9,20,30,22 September 2003
Unknown," Indelicate Stitching.
","Every time one of these characters suffers a trauma and can't recall his true identity -- whether it's Matt Damon in 'The Bourne Identity' or Geena Davis in 'The Long Kiss Goodnight' -- they always discover in the end that they are amnesic assassins. Inevitably they're assassins. They never wake up to find that they used to be bus boys in a restaurant or gas station attendants on the night shift. They're always skilled killers.It's no surprise that that's what happens to Liam Neeson in this action-filled and thoroughly routine thriller.The writers, the director, and everyone else associated with this production have a lot to answer for because the central idea of questionable identity is itself so packed with resonance. Who among us hasn't asked himself, 'Who the hell am I really?' But that's the genre. It has its cachet. More than that, though, is the generic form itself: the person who finds himself adrift, a stranger in a strange land, where the people have queer customs and don't speak the same language and nobody understands what you say or, if they understand, can't bring themselves to believe it, as in Roman Polanski's 'Frantic', a much better film despite its absurdity. That's the glorious summit. A guy who doesn't know who he is, in a place in which he doesn't know his way around. I once found myself in that position -- trying to locate a toilet in a huge hotel in an exotic land, and it was no picnic, let me tell you.This is one cliché cobbled together with every other cliché the writers could think of. The goal is strictly commercial. 'Art' is somebody's name.We have -- spectacularly -- an urban car chase for a change. The cutting is instantaneous. The night-time streets are crowded with traffic (but not enough to impede the speeding cars), slippery, and glistening with neon reflections. The horns of terrified innocent motorists blare and dwindle with the Doppler effect. Look out -- there's a trolley coming! Shots of the hero's twisted face last a fraction of a second. One car tries to bump the other off the street at high speed. A sedan slides into a 180 degree turn. One of them hits a pile of garbage and does a half twist in the air before landing on its roof and sliding to a halt amid a shower of fake sparks.Why go on? Well, one more thing that always bamboozles me because it violates one of Newton's laws. In desperation, Neeson grabs up a sliver of broken mirror and plunges it into the villain's neck without its doing any damage to his hand. It's like seeing one fighter decking another by bumping foreheads.I kind of like Liam Neeson. His drooping nose begins in the middle of his forehead and he looms over everyone else on the streets of Berlin. (He would loom even more gigantically if it were Tokyo.) I enjoyed his Russian companion too. She's not staggeringly beautiful but Russian accents sound so compellingly fragile in women. Neesom's 'wife', on the other hand, can't really act believably but doesn't have to. No one has ever looked more elegant and cool and blond in a black backless dress.Best performance award -- envelope, please -- Frank Langella. From a handsome Lothario in the 60s he's turned into a marvelous character actor. He's the only person in the film who gives a truly convincing performance, but Bruno Ganz as a sympathetic botanist isn't far behind. Langella gets the best lines too, though the writers don't spare him the clichés either. Best One-Way Ticket To Purgatory -- Flavio Labiano, the cinematographer, for yet another ghoulish green action movie. Any more of this and I'll have to ask the nurse for Dramamine.",5,10,15,26 November 2011
Gran Torino," Grumpy Old Man
","It wouldn't be fair to say that Clint Eastwood was coasting through this movie. Nobody who directs and stars in a large-scale production while he's easing towards ninety is able to coast very far. Yet there is a relaxed and sometimes careless quality to this movie about a grouchy, lonely curmudgeon who slouches around mumbling to himself, smoking and drinking beer, cursing his neighbors, rebuking himself for something that happened more than fifty years ago, before his climactic expiation.One of those next-door neighbors is a Hmong kid named Thao. The Hmong are an internally marginal group who live in the mountains of Southeast Asia. A major effort was made by the US to enlist them on our side during the Vietnam War. A large family of Hmong live in that modest Midwestern house. Thao's initiation into his Asian gang involves stealing Clint's prized and exquisitely preserved Gran Torino. The plot is foiled and Clint gradually finds himself swept up into the dynamics of Hmong home life and Thao's integration into the gang.At this point in his life, Clint is pretty old and he claims this will be the last film he acts in. Well, the withdrawal is sensible enough. There aren't many roles for men who are so late in life. The ones that are available tend to form a genre of their own. The narrative structure seems to follow a line like that of 'Gran Torino.' Grumbling old man is bitter and set in his ways, sometimes comically rigid. A new challenge enters his life and he rediscovers his humanity. Paul Newman went through it; Jack Lemon and Walter Matthau; Henry Fonda.As an example of the genus, this one isn't notable in any way. Except that Clint's profane, mumbling monologues are often pretty funny. And there's an amusing scene in which Clint and his barber try to teach Thao to speak the way real men speak -- nothing but curses and racist insults. As a director he keeps his performers hitting their marks.The performers themselves aren't always up to professional standards. His Italian barber, John Carroll Lynch, sounds like an actor. The boy and girl from the Hmong family don't quite clear that bar, although their monolingual elders come across as authentic enough.It's one of Clint Eastwood's lesser efforts but I give him credit for having done it at all. Even at its worst, it's not as insulting to the viewer as some of the meretricious trash affecting our screens these days.",6,4,13,6 December 2009
The Hurt Locker," Tense and thoughtful.
","The 'hurt locker' of the title refers presumably both to the painful memories the men will carry around with them for the rest of their lives and to the plastic crate that the first sergeant (Renner) keeps under his bunk, filled with souvenirs of explosive devices he's disarmed over he year's tour of duty in Iraq.Renner is proud of them. He's disarmed more than 700 IEDs. One of his prize items is a little snap button that blows up the man who pushes it. That takes will power.The other two men of Bravo Company we get to know are the sergeant next in command of the detail (Mackie) who detests Renner's enthusiasm and bravery as a matter of errant impulse and who has thoughts about killing him. The third member is a grunt (Geraghty) who only wants to stay out of trouble.The taut script is by Mark Boal and it's quite good. It avoids most of the war-movie clichés. Or, when it uses them, as during a friendly drunken punch out contest between Renner and Mackie, the laughter and grab ass gradually turn purposeful because, after all, Mackie dislikes Renner's reckless spiritedness.There are few shots of home life. After his tour is finished, Renner goes home to his lovely wife and baby and chops carrots for dinner. Bored, he volunteers for another tour. But nobody dreams of home or talks about it. As far as Sergeant Mackie is concerned, after a piece of shrapnel has missed his neck by an inch, he remarks that 'if I die out here nobody will give a **** except my mother and father but that don't count.' Nobody dies slowly, gasping out a few last words, 'Tell Prudence it was her all the time, ya big lug.' You know the impression of battle you take away from this film? Not that of soldiers at war, but of police officers in an extremely hostile neighborhood. A soldier is in the center of an empty public square working on a dangerous IED. He's covered by half a dozen men at a distance of about fifty yard, on the streets and on rooftops. But this is the middle of a city. The apartment houses and the tower of a mosque overlook the scene. And, after a few moments of quiet, curious civilians slowly appear on the roofs and balconies. Not many. And not threatening. Or are they? One man is pointing or aiming an object at a soldier. It looks like a video camera and probably is. But then why are the three men on the mosque tower signaling to the camera man, or are they only waving to a friend? Shouldn't you shoot them? Clearly there are enemies. Somebody planted the IEDs. But how do you tell the enemies from the innocent civilians who are waving to friends? Even outside the city, in the middle of an arid nowhere, the detail exchanges fire at a distance with only four or five insurgents -- or 'hajes', as the soldiers call them. The pitched battle is small and inconclusive. The only way of telling who 'won' is by how many men walked away from it.Nice script. Kathryn Bigelow's direction has some neat touches as well, as when a dust devil casually insinuates itself into a pause in the battle.But I had a problem with her direction too, and it's getting to be a big one, at least for me. The camera wobbles. It skims and pans and zooms in and out pointlessly. The action is usually confusing enough. For what reason should it be compounded? But Bigelow, while no artist, has an eye for what sells and, the drunken camera work aside, she does a good job. The lens practically caresses the jumbo .50 caliber sniper's rifle. And she lingers over the clumsy task of cleaning bullets of blood from the magazine to prevent jamming.I don't know if I'd call it a gripping movie. For all the time spent with the three principals, we don't really get to know them except for their cardinal traits. Yet it's a decently done film, and instructive as well. It deserves to be seen.",7,2,4,2 January 2011
K-19: The Widowmaker," Disaster At Sea.
","A sad and confused movie. It's not Kathryn Bigelow's finest hour as a director but I don't image there's too much that could have been done with the script, which seems as hastily thrown together as the submarine itself.The most egregious jolt to continuity probably arrives near the end. Liam Neeson, the Executive Officer, has been a paragon of good sense throughout, pleading the cause of humanity in the face of skipper Tom Ford's blockheaded determination to stretch his boat's envelope and refuse aid from an American ship nearby.The crew mutinies. They handcuff Ford, who sometimes seems deranged, and turn over the boat to Neeson. The officers agree with the act. The commissar initiates the act. Then Neeson's character, with a pistol in his hand, spins around in a neat 'about FACE' and releases Ford from his shackles, turning command back over to him with a big smile. The non sequitur drops to the deck with a heavy CLUNK heard throughout the boat.There is little joy on K-19. The boat itself was hastily assembled in an attempt to keep up with US innovations and the recklessness showed up repeatedly in one accident after another. The photographer and art director turn the boat into the kind of dismal mechanical prison that no US submarine ever looked like. The lights are low, the fittings shabby and peeling, the bulkheads warped and fragile. It's enough to kill your appetite if you're not eating caviar and drinking red wine.But I can see why this was greenlighted. 'Das Boot' had been a great critical and commercial success a decade earlier. 'Das Boot' was a movie about a German U-boat in wartime and it invested its characters with human features. This is a Hollywood movie that tries to do the same thing for the USSR that 'Das Boot' did for Germany. Except that now we have CGIs which allow more in the way of fires and explosions than Wolfgang Peterson had in 1982.As the captain, Ford is rather dull; Neeson is a more animated and thoughtful figure; Peter Sarsgaard as the reactor officer is winning in a naive boyish way. Loved his cowardly refusal to enter the irradiated Compartment of Doom.The whole thing can be construed as a post Cold War analogy. The Russian people were just as good as anybody else but their leadership was whimsical and stupid.",5,0,0,9 January 2016
The Longest Day," Colossal, Stupendous, Brobdingnagian -- and BIG!!
","Darryl F. Zanuck's epic story of the D-Day invasion of Normandy in 1944 boggles the mind with its scope and ambition. It's properly called 'Darryl F. Zanuck's' movie because the cigar-chomping Goy from Wahoo, Nebraska, is the prime mover. Without him, and without the four-million-dollar infusion of his own financial blood, it would never have been made. Zanuck was just coming off a series of flops at the time ('Satan Never Sleeps'?) and this was his last big shot. He controlled everything. He inserted an important part for his then-girlfriend, Irene Demick, during the demise of his marriage. Not that this was anything but traditional in Hollywood then and now. Darryl's son, Richard, gave HIS paramour an important, if silent, part as Charlton Heston's girlfriend in 'Planet of the Apes.' It's GOOD to be the producer. Anyway, it has to be Zanuck's movie because it's a vast ensemble piece with none of the forty-two stars being given more than a few minutes of screen time.There are no back stories at all. None of the characters, most of them based on real people drawn from Cornelius Ryan's blockbuster book, have wives or children. There are no flashbacks to anyone's happy boyhood, fishing barefoot from a pier. Nobody grew up in a dysfunctional family in the slums either. Nobody carries a picture of the girl back home.The Americans and Brits speak English, the French speak French, and the Germans speak German. This means subtitles, which in turn means that if it were produced today nobody under the age of thirty would enjoy seeing it, since MTV and 'Die Hard Forever' and 'I Dismember Mamma' have no subtitles. One can almost hear the complaints of the kids sitting around chugging energy drinks and squirming with the effort to look and read at the same time. Well, maybe that's a little harsh. I'll make an exception. There would be no squirming among the kids in any household that has a copy of 'The Origin of Species' on one of its bookshelves.Aside from the expense and the massive logistical effort on display, it's not a bad movie. There are a few awkward moments in the script, true, such as when a solemn actor tells someone else, and the audience as well, that this is an important day and we should all try to remember it.And, thank God, no speeches about patriotism. These guys on both sides are dying. The nationalism is on display and doesn't need to be spelled out. There's a good deal of irony too. It tempers the obvious heroism. Some German soldiers come out of a bunker with their hands up, crying 'Bitte, bitte!' and a GI shoots them all down, tips his helmet back, and muses, 'I wonder what 'Bitte, bitte' means.' In 'Saving Private Ryan', any Germans trying to surrender are automatically exterminated without qualms. But 'The Longest Day' is a kind of transitional film. Those produced during and immediately after the war pretty much demonized the enemy. Those coming later in the 1960s and afterward were usually more 'realistic' in that they had more blood, and the enemy, although a nuisance, was sometimes humanized. But if the enemy weren't demonized, they weren't sympathized with in any way. They were offed matter-of-factly, the way Dirty Harry shot his adversaries. Just bodies.The British here are the kind who are jolly and brave and who hide their emotions carefully, as Richard Burton does. The Americans are good-natured complainers who practice seductive speeches in rudimentary French before jumping out of airplanes. The Germans are of two types -- the commanders who sit around sipping tea in palaces, and the men and junior officers at the front who frantically try to communicate with them while holding off an inexorable Allied force.There are concessions to commercialism, as there almost inevitably will be. Some incidents are depicted that never took place. Some mistakes are skipped over (the frenetic and pointless gyrations of the airplanes carrying the parachutists). And Irene Demick has a hair style straight out of 1962. Of course, our side wins. Our side always wins. That's why you will never see a movie called 'The Battle of the Java Sea' or 'A Yank at Kasserine Pass.' But it's a good movie, almost a documentary, and should be seen for its educational value alone because it isn't fictionalized like 'Saving Private Ryan.' It may not be as bloody as some people would prefer but it's instructive -- and it's so gol darned BIG that the grand sweep of this ineluctable, elephantine monster carries you along willy nilly.",7,2,4,11 July 2008
Patton," Epic hagiography
","It's a splendidly done movie. Scott's performance is powerful. He does everything but reach out, grab you by the shirt, and shout in your face. Karl Malden is likable and full of common sense, but he is the only person in the movie whom we can grasp as a character -- except for Scott himself. Scott is as good at his job as Patton was, and in fact the quality of his performance is less volatile than Patton's own, with virtually no weak spots.That's part of the problem. Patton himself. I suppose that like most people he had a 'good' side -- loving family, played with his dog, collected stamps and whatnot. But as good and aggressive a general as he was, he wasn't a particularly likable guy. It's easy to demand that everyone in your command have shoes as shiny as yours -- especially when you've got some black PFC doing your shining for you.The movie is noticeably slanted. Patton's weakness, like Coriolanus's, is ambition. Sometimes it's played for laughs. He carried the stars of a Lieutenant General around with him until word of his promotion comes down, then immediately has them pinned on. But only three times is his meanness illustrated without tongue in cheek. (1) During a conversation with Bradley he reveals that he's disobeyed orders by sending his army on a mission to beat Montgomery in taking Sicily. He calls the attack 'a reconnaissance in force'. He receives an order to get his troops back where they belong and tells his aide to send the message back because it's garbled. 'A simple old soldier,' Bradly comments disapprovingly. (2) He orders General Truscott to stage some amphibious landings which will help him take Messina before Montgomery. Truscott complains that they're not prepared to do that without heavy casualties. Patton lies down and threatens to fire Truscott and get someone else to do the job. (3) While visiting a hospital and presenting the wounded with decorations he comes across a soldier whose nerves are shot and who is weeping, and Patton slaps him twice and sends him back to the front.His mean streak went beyond those incidents. He used to practice his arrogant, threatening scowl in front of the mirror. Whether or not it improved the GI's morale to wear neckties in combat is, at best, arguable. (What would Patton make of the Israeli army?) But the simple historical fact is that the movie pitches even these 'mean' incidents at the audience like softballs. He didn't just slap a soldier who was feeling sorry for himself, which is the picture the film presents. He slapped two soldiers on separate occasions, one suffering from combat fatigue (which is no joke) and the other from malaria and other illnesses. Patton also enjoyed an intimate relationship with his niece, a Red Cross donut girl, who accompanied him in England and France, much to his wife's displeasure.Those slapping incidents cost Patton a bit in the way of professional esteem but it didn't cost any lives. And it didn't cause him any remorse. Even in his 'apology,' he claims he was trying to 'shame a coward.' What DID cost lives was Patton's cobbling together a small task force to liberate a POW camp in Germany shortly before the war's end, when such a dangerous move was no longer necessary. 'Task Force Baum' was recognized by its leaders for the lost cause it was, a plunge deep into enemy territory without any backup. There were 53 vehicles and 294 men. All the vehicles were destroyed or captured. Twenty-five of the men were killed, 32 wounded, and almost all the rest captured. The purpose of the mission, it was tacitly agreed, was to rescue Patton's son-in-law.His fitful harshness towards his troops is usually justified in the movie, even if it looks excessive. The soldier-slapping scene is preceded by one in which Patton kneels in the hospital, whispers something to a soldier whose face is covered by bandages, and lovingly places a medal on his chest. Next thing he encounters: Tim Considine, fully dressed, sitting up, and sobbing with self pity. Earlier, when Patton asks a cook why he's not wearing sidearms, the cook laughs genially and replies, 'Sidearms? Why, hell, General, I'm a cook!' I missed the part where cooks learn to laugh in the face of orders from a general, but it gives Patton a chance to tear everybody a new one.Everyone paid for Patton's ambition and vanity, even those not under his command. The gasoline and other supplies he diverted to his own forces during the run through France helped him alright, but they were also needed elsewhere.The movie's subtitle is 'Salute to a Rebel.' Very stylish for 1970 audiences, but the material is presented in such a way as to leave us with a lingering admiration for Patton's genius and bullheadedness. What kind of 'rebel' was he? He was more of an authoritarian Arschloch than anybody else in his greater vicinity.What the writers, the director, and George C. Scott have given us, to paraphrase someone else, is not a warts-and-all portrait but the suggestion that there is something heroic about a wart.I gave the movie high marks because it's as well done as it is -- disregarding its relationship to Patton himself. I didn't mind so much that the wrong tanks were used and that the production could only find two Heinkel 111s in flying condition. The location shooting is great, the cinematography crisp and unimpeachable, the score one of Goldsmith's best, and Scott's performance deserved whatever awards it got.",9,32,42,12 February 2005
La Grande Illusion," Great movie
","The image is grainy, the sound tinny, and it's a great movie, one of only a handful of movies that are truly anti-war. The ordinary 'anti-war movie' typically gives us plenty of blood and intestines to show us how awful war is -- and then at the end, we win. Nobody really wins here, although I guess two French officers escape from the German POW camp successfully and reach Switzerland. But this film gives us no battles, no gore, only one death, and no long speeches about how fruitless it all is.There are four principal actors -- Gabin, Dalio, Fresnay, and von Stroheim (who picked up his 'von' from the same place Claus von Bulow got his). Gabin has big eyes and a homely face that seems made of putty. Fresnay projects aristocracy and good breeding. Dalio is Rosenthal, the Jewish French lieutenant. He speaks German with a Yiddish accent, like James Cagney did. Dalio was in a number of French movies that have become classics of their kind then, barely escaping the Nazis, came to Hollywood where he played in three movies made from Hemingway stories, leading to his apotheosis on the silver screen as the gay interior decorator in 'Pillow Talk.' The 'grand illusion' in the title comes from an exchange between Gabin and Dalio as they are crossing the German countryside in civilian clothes. Gabin says, I don't know who will win this war 'but let's hope it is the last,' and Dalio dismisses the hope as an illusion. History has come down on Dalio's side. As Santayana put it, 'only the dead have seen the end of war.' The film takes a trajectory from amusing to tragic, involving several POW plot touchstones -- the digging of the tunnel, the musical show in which prisoners dress up as girls, the hidden contraband in the barracks. The comedy is pretty good sometimes. The Russian prisoners receive a big box, a present from the Tsaritsa. 'Caviar and booze!' They invite the French and English prisoners to the coming feast, but when they break open the crate it's full of books -- 'Introduction to Grammar,' 'Elements of Philosophy.' They are so enraged they set fire to the box and its contents and brawl with the guards. The Russian aristocracy might have avoided revolution if they'd understood the needs of the common man.The saddest part is near the end, when Gabin and Dalio take shelter in a farmhouse with a German widow and her young daughter. The widow is plain looking, young but not too young, and blond, and she's lost all the men in her family to the war. The little girl, Charlotte, is trusting but not cute. Over time Gabin and the widow fall in love. He teaches her a bit of French and she teaches him a little German -- 'Lotte hat blaue Augen.' It's all very understated. No one weeps when Gabin and Dalio leave, except perhaps the viewer. I'm moved every time I see it, enveloped in a loathsome sentiment. It's well worth watching, if only for Eric von Stroheim's performance as the major in charge of the prisoner's castle. He is an aristocrat and so is one of the French prisoners, Fresnay. Von Stroheim treats Fresnay with masculine affection, like the geranium he cultivates in his stone fortress. The two aristocrats know their time has come, that the world belongs to commoners like Gabin and Dalio. They're like the gunfighters or gangs of the disappearing Old West, unable to adjust to the changes. Fresnay is philosophical about it. Von Stroheim regrets having only been severely wounded and not killed outright. That monocle! Those braces on his neck! The cigarette holder! And I swear that he speaks French with an American accent! See the major click his heels and bow. See him drape his greatcoat over his shoulders like a cape. See the movie!",9,3,5,16 April 2005
The Illusionist," Outstanding.
","What a splendid team effort this film represents. The direction and the performances are fine, and they're lifted well above the simply 'fine' by the art direction, set dresser, photographer, and by Philip Glass's most aptly otherworldly score. Even Prague, frozen in time, the perennial stand in for turn-of-the-century Vienna, looks more authentic than it has before.The story involves the rivalry between the evil and ambitious Crown Prince of Austria-Hungary (Rufus Sewell) and a humble cabinet maker's son (Edward Norton) who has turned into a world famous stage magician or 'illusionist') for the love of a young noblewoman (Jessica Biel). It's well written and acted. Sewell could have turned the Prince into a maniac frothing at the mouth but instead has kept him a quietly smug heavy who mostly keeps his violence under wraps. Jessica Biel is competent and not too beautiful as the prize, although, to be sure, judging from her appearance as a child, she should have grown up to be Cate Blanchett instead of Jessica Biel. Edward Norton, just when you think he's exhausted his bag of thespian tricks, comes up with another fresh character, this time intelligent, confident, elliptical, enigmatic.The special effects deserve a prize. After the supposed murder of Jessica Biel's character, Norton appears again on stage, but this time not in tails but shirtsleeves and without props -- no cane, no fluttering doves, no top hat concealing an albino rabbit -- not even an introduction. He sits alone before the audience, saying nothing, raises his open palm and an apparition slowly appears. We know it's all process photography, yet through the sensory impressions left by the visuals and the score, it turns into a very spooky moment. The rumor spreads that Norton has made a Faustian pact and it gets him into even more trouble.I won't go on with this, I don't think. 'All will be revealed,' as Charlie Chan used to say, or was it Hercule Poirot? I can't say the plot is entirely successful but I can say that there haven't been that many more beautiful movies lately.",8,2,2,19 September 2007
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," A Life Course With A Twist.
","A sweet sentimental tale of a man, Brad Pitt as Benjamin Button, who is born in 1918 New Orleans as a diminutive and withered old man and dies in the 1970s as an infant suffering from dementia. Actually, Benjamin Button is not only Brad Pitt, but is played by Peter Badalamenti at the age of around ten, and by Robert Towers as a slightly older teen-aged Benjamin Button. The casting is marvelous. So is the makeup. It took me some time to realize that the ghostly pale, withered figure, the ancient lady wheezing out a few hoarse words and dying in the hospital bed, was Cate Blanchett.It's hard to resist the story. Benjamin Button is an appealing character, soft spoken, honest, and polite. He speaks little and acts mostly as an observer of everyday life in New Orleans, with occasional visits to Murmansk, New York, Paris, and other far-away-place with strange sounding names. It's a very Southern movie in many respects, slow, like Button himself, contrasting the quiet, colorful characters of New Orleans with the rambunctious snobbery of the New York ballet set, the sterility of Paris's hospital room, and the danger and bloodshed of Russia. But, insallah, we do not see a Mardi Gras in New Orleans, just the patient, gracious sound of a ragtime piece played on the appropriately named piano. We only hear a few notes of the ragtime and they're played simply and slowly, like the film itself. The overscore traces the plot with fairy tale harps and celeste.The performances are pretty good all around. Cate Blanchett, of course, is unforgettable -- a fine actress with the most memorable nose in today's movies. Brad Pitt, I didn't care for earlier in his career, another hunk for teens to swoon over, showing his behind as well as the rest of his jacked up body in 'Troy.' But I've come to appreciate his range after comparing his recedent personality here with his maniacal psychopath in 'Kalifornia.' Julia Ormond doesn't have much to do as the daughter of Pitt and Blanchett.It's an engaging movie -- I couldn't get away from it -- and the photography and lighting are exceptionally good but I had a problem with the plot. It's a tear jerker. The thing is laid out like an obstacle course. Brief moments of happiness, fame, success are inevitably followed by tragedy. Benjamin Button is a little like Hercule Poirot. When he's around, somebody is going to die, except that, to ratchet up the sentiment quotient, the person who dies must be someone that Button loves or has learned to respect. One by one, his family and friends disappear, usually because of some unnamed disease, as Ali McGraw did in 'Love Story.' Pitt is given lines that reflect his keen insight, such as, 'You can curse the fates; you can go round the moon; but when the end comes you have to let go.' The centerpiece of the tale is the relationship between Blanchett, who ages from a ten-year-old girl to a dying old woman, and Pitt, who ages from a sepulchral old man to a dying little baby. That particularly relationship is nicely structured. Blanchett and Pitt have their happiest moments in mid life when they are both the same age. It dampens the manipulative effect of all those unending tragedies.",6,0,0,24 June 2017
Hidden Figures," 'The Way Things Are.'
","A necessary reminder of days gone by and why resentment still lingers. It's 1961 in one of those bureaucratic offices in the NASA research center at Langley, Virginia. Since it's 1961 in Virginia, all the facilities are segregated by law, including office buildings, rest rooms, and drinking fountains. Well, there are about two dozen African-American ladies who are more than usually smart and serve as 'computers' -- ie., human beings who do math by hand -- and their African-American supervisor is the cooperative and relatively restrained Olivia Spencer. Their immediate boss is the very polite, very Southern, very racist Kirsten Dunst, whose name means 'haze' in German. (I just threw that in because I had to learn it in a painful German class and saw no reason why you shouldn't suffer a little too over the word. Now we both know, and you've paid the lesser price, believe me.) Where was I? Yes, in 1961 NASA didn't even have the most elementary of technical facilities and these ladies are really math whizzes -- one especially, Taraji P. Henson, is even more knowing than the rest and is recruited by the director, Kevin Costner, into the sanctum sanctorum of the board room, which she enter boldly, where no 'Negro' has gone before. The all-white male staff don't greet her. They simply stare in disbelief. Casting has made the right choices in all cases. None of the ladies is a glamour girl, although I wouldn't have minded Beyoncé in a prominent role, come to think of it. Costner, however, is indifferent to the staff's response, just as he's indifferent to the indignities these human computers are suffering. As one of the ladies puts it, 'He only thinks about numbers.' So naturally when Costner chews out Henson for so often being out of the office, she shoots back with a couple of reasons why: the rest rooms in the building are segregated, and when she has to visit the bathroom she must run to the nearest colored bathroom in a building a quarter of a mile away, rain or shine. Costner take a crowbar to the 'Whites Only' bathroom and demolishes it. The Russians are ahead of us in the space race, so let's not leave our desks any more than we have to, and by the way, let's work late without pay. And no more of this racist stuff.The film goes on to trumpet the very real talents and achievements of Taraji Henson and the rest, along with all the indignities imposed on them. For many Americans, the indignities are the stuff of history but it wasn't all that long ago. I remember hitch-hiking north on US 40 and encountering colored and white rest rooms at all the stops, well into Maryland. We needed this reminder. That kind of 'racist stuff' is behind us now, thank God, but the sentiments persist in some quarters.Therein lies the chief problem with this movie. I'll have to shed my PC mantle for a few minutes. The movie is buffed to a high sheen. The whites are all either prejudiced or, at best, sullen or indifferent, with John Glenn a notable exception. The blacks are uniformly good -- indignant but well behaved, except for one or two thoroughly justified outbursts that are necessary to capture the attention of the white guys. The story lacks subtlety. And further I don't need to be preached to or taught a lesson because I'm already a member of the choir. The few scenes that are nuanced stand out like a gastropod on its poduncle. Here's one such scene. Towards the end, when the ladies have proved their value, Olivia Spencer and her nemesis Kirsten Dunst find themselves alone in the now-integrated ladies' room. Dunst approaches the ever-smiling Spencer and assures her that she, Dunst, is not really prejudiced against black, regardless of what Spencer might think, 'please believe me.' Still smiling politely, Spencer replies, 'Yes. I really believe that you think that.' How desperately the movie needs more such scenes.There's another irritating weakness too. A lot of time is given over to Tararji Henson's budding romance and ultimate marriage to a black colonel in the U.S. Army. It's all there -- the widowhood, the four charming children, the occasional misunderstanding, the declamation of undying love, the transfer of the mother's wedding ring at the birthday party, the tears of happiness. My God, it's Lifetime Movie Network!I've now gotten the bad stuff out of the way and can say that the movie is well worth watching for any number of reasons. Math wizards are always fascinating anyway. It's a special talent that shows up early in childhood and is later heavily impacted by training, so it's hard to separate the inherited talent from the knowledge picked up in a calculus class. It's not a talent measured on any of the most commonly used intelligence tests, which dismiss it as a mere 'aptitude', like musical ability. Shame on the psychometrists.Anyway, you won't regret seeing it.",6,2,5,10 September 2017
Lincoln," He Belongs To The Ages.
","It's a more demanding film than you might think. Lincoln, the sixteenth president of the United States, ruled for a bit more than four years during a period of turmoil unparalleled in American history. And he pulled is through it all until he was cut down by an assassin.I'm not at all sure he'd be allowed to do it today. I kept thinking, while watching this rather long, dark, complicated movie about Lincoln's struggle to pass the law that would free all the slaves everywhere -- not the weak Emancipation Proclamation but the Constitutional Amendment -- that he may well never have been elected to national office of any kind.In Mike Nichols' 'Primary Colors' John Travolta is running for president and when he falls behind in the polls he dithers over whether his campaign should 'go negative'. That was 1998. Today the question would never be raised because everything is negative and the 'opposition research' is phenomenally effective -- hated by everyone and it works like a charm.The specialists of today would have made mincemeat of Lincoln's candidacy. They would begin with the big ears, the hint of villainy in his features, his warts. In his youth he experienced what today we would call a major affective disorder, which would unquestionably be called 'bipolar.' His minimal political experience would be a major stumbling block -- a few years in the state legislature. Everything he ever wrote would be examined for a misplaced comma. He was tall, gangly, had the appearance of a hick, and was unphotogenic. The tale of his sneaking into Washington disguised as a woman would be accepted as fact by many. He'd have a mountain of trouble being elected today.Yet he was arguably the best president the United States has ever had. Aided by his secretary, he wrote his own speeches and they were marvels of lucidity. The Gettysburgh Address, which isn't his most compelling, has been compared to Pericles' funeral oration. He successfully managed to walk a political tightrope with abolitionists jeering from one side and an outraged audience of Democrats throwing objects at him from the other. It's hard to imagine how he could have done it without going nuts all over again.Spielberg's movie captures the familiar figure of Lincoln -- the awkwardness, the tall folk stories, the absence of bombast. (At Gettyburgh, the man who preceded Lincoln spoke for more than two hours; Lincoln's address was less than 250 words long.) Daniel Day-Lewis could hardly be better. The torment is there but Day-Lewis keeps a lid on it. Everyone else is professional, though the movie belongs to Lincoln.It was a curious decision to focus the story on the struggle to pass the fourteenth amendment. It's not usually thought of as an illustrious moment, only as a footnote to the winning of the Civil War. But the writers dig into the issue and it's a little like turning over a rock and seeing slimy little white things wriggling for cover. Votes in favor of passage were happily bought by Lincoln's administration. If there's a lame duck Democrat you can buy his vote by promising him that he will be appointed postmaster somewhere. It's all taken for granted.Nothing here about Lincoln's more celebrated and arguable actions. He used a flimsy excuse to throw the politicians of Baltimore into jail without habeus corpus. He was under Confederate fire on the outskirts of the capitol. Nothing about his delegatory sins. The astonishing disappointment of some of his appointments -- MacClellan (twice), Burnside, and the rest -- don't come up. His first cabinet, he filled idealistically with his political rivals, with the expected results -- chaos.Moreover, the movie is in some ways confusing and dull. Not the fault of either the performers or the director but the script is a mish-mash of personalities and conflict that are hard to keep straight. And almost all of it seems to take place in sepulchral interiors. Lincoln was as good as they come but the movie isn't. In the end, concentrating on the fourteenth amendment may have been a wise choice. It encompassed most of the awesome and terrifying dynamics that surrounded Lincoln during his entire period in office. And I'd like to shake Spielberg's hand for sparing us from still another trite staging of the assassination at Ford's theater.It's in some ways a challenging movie. The kids will wonder what all the fuss was about. They may even say, 'So THAT'S who Lincoln was.' But overall it's quite a spectacle and maybe an object history lesson.",7,0,2,14 November 2013
Rules of Engagement," A Very Foggy War
","'The Rules of Engagement' got some pretty crummy external reviews, but it's not that bad.The performances are all quite good. Guy Pearce was nailed for his American accent but I don't know why. He comes across as somebody whose regional dialect was subject to some New York City gestation. Let's give him some credit. The Brits used to stick to Southern accents (viz., Scarlett O'Hara, Blanche DuBois) but have lately become more discriminating (viz., Daniel Day-Lewis in 'Gangs of New York'). It's a big improvement over the generic American dialect that Russel Crowe and Charlize Theron come up with.Where was I? Oh, yes. The combat scenes are well done. They owe a great deal to 'Saving Private Ryan' of course. Every combat scene in every movie for the next decade or so will owe a lot to Private Ryan, in particular the abundance of bloody wounds and the sound of bullets clanking off metal surfaces.The locations are well chosen and the photography is up to professional par.If there is a weakness it's in the script. The Tommy Lee Jones character is presented to us as a drunk or a former drunk, but nothing comes of it. By the end he seems to have found the kind of redemption that all drunks find at the end of uplifting movies, except for Paul Newman in 'The Verdict,' who loses faith in friendship even as he finds redemption in good deeds. And he sensibly keeps on drinking.There's a fight between the two macho Marines -- Jones and Jackson -- the point of which eludes me. We really don't need a brawl between two middle-aged men to pump up the middle section of the film.The courtroom scene reeks of drama largely because the director has decided it should. People stand up in the witness box and shout angrily at the pesky prosecutor and admit things they shouldn't just because they're enraged. And there is a touching scene at the end, in which Jackson and a former enemy exchange salutes, but it's corny and there is triumphant music swelling in the background, all by the numbers.I should mention something else that became more clear on second viewing. At the beginning of 'The Green Berets' -- an atrocious John Wayne movie about Vietnam -- a civilian reporter seems to accuse Col. Wayne of militarism. 'You been in Vietnam?', asks Wayne. No. 'Ah-HUH,' comments Wayne dismissively. A sharp contrast is thereby drawn between the characters we are to meet -- those who have been there and those who have not. A similar distinction is made in this movie, and in the most simple-minded way. There are three strata. From the top downward: (1) the heroic men who have been in combat; (2) the well-meaning Marines who haven't; and (3) the lying, perjuring, evidence-destroying suits who have no principles and are out only to further their own careers. Yet, it's a thought-provoking mature movie in a way that, say, 'A Few Good Men' was simply not. I would give 'Saving Private Ryan' a higher rank because of its originality. Nothing in 'The Rules of Engagement' is particularly clear cut. Jackson's character does order his men to fire on civilians, including women and kids, who are firing at him, and the firing from the crowd is covered up by the politicians who want to bury the guy so that the good old USA doesn't have to take the blame for all those deaths. But Jackson is given a good line. 'That's not murder. It's COMBAT.' Sometimes these days it gets a little difficult to distinguish combat from murder, and one of the reasons this movie may irritate some viewers is that the military comes off as both brave and honorable, if not exactly flawless. These Marines are gung ho, reasonably intelligent, and capable of remorse. I would guess there are many people who prefer the kind of idiot played by Jack Nicholson in 'A Few Good Men,' a sadistic, perjuring, stupid, male chauvinist pig. 'A Few Good Men' is a more satisfying movie if you're into self righteousness and anti-militarism.Marines and military people in general tend towards a certain set of common attitudes but there is as much diversity among them as in any other subculture, except maybe devotees of panjandrums of the more extreme stripe. The Marines whom I taught at Camp Lejeune were as bright, curious, and industrious as any students at the nearby University of North Carolina.We all know what we would have done if we'd been Jack Nicholson. We wouldn't have done what he did. We'd have been legal and moral. But this movie asks a different question. What would we have done if we'd been in Jackson's boots? No easy answers there, though the ending kind of betrays the message that the movie itself carries.I should add that it seems to be rare to 'hang anybody out to dry' for making mistakes in combat. A week before this note was entered, Doctors Without Borders accused US forces of deliberately attacking its hospital in Afghanistan, as a top US commander said the deadly air strikes were a mistake. The hospital, also known as Médecins Sans Frontières, claims its medical facility in Kunduz was 'deliberately bombed' three days ago, killing at least 22 people. General John Campbell said he could not provide more details about what happened, including who may have failed to follow procedures for avoiding attacks on hospitals. He said he must await the outcome of multiple investigations. 'Await the outcome of multiple investigations.'",6,2,4,5 November 2005
Children of Men," Not With A Whimper.
","There's a remarkable long Steadicam shot in which the camera follows the hero, Clive Owen, through a raging battle -- buildings being blown up, bullets pinging around him -- and into a doorway and up a flight of stairs and through room after room until he finds what he's searching for -- the first woman to become pregnant in eighteen years. Owen, and some supporters who come and go, are trying to get this pregnant African stranger to an offshore haven where, biology permitting, the human race will begin to reproduce itself again. I was unable to figure out how one baby will save the species.Neither is the reason for the pandemic infertility ever explained but it doesn't really matter much. It's basically a chase movie. Owen and his charge don't have many friends. It's a Hobbesian war of all against all. London is a wreck. The ruins are filled with refugees from other countries, each eagerly killing one another, shouting slogans, waving their AK-47s over their heads. The air is filled with gun fire. A pox on all their houses; a midline granuloma!As a chase movie it's pretty good, carrying a powerful emotional message. The gravid woman, who is quite ordinary, is a Life Force, kind of like Zorba the Greek. I guess that's intended to be good, and it is if you ignore certain inconvenient facts. (The tubercle bacillus has a Life Force too.) It's also easy to read a religious lesson in it. None of that's necessary though. It's tense and tautly constructed, even if it doesn't make much sense. The refugees have no one they can trust and few are anxious to help them. The best seem to lack all conviction, while the worst are full of passionate intensity.I am, though, getting tired of this photographic conceit in which the sun never shines, everyone is grimy and greasy, it's either drizzling or looks about to, every object has an unhappy greenish tinge, and all the men need a shave. Enough already. I also have to wag my finger because there are plenty of dogs in the movie but no cats. My cat, Ajax the Lesser, pointed this out to me. Outside of a dog, a cat is a man's best friend. Inside a dog, it's too dark to see.There is also a kind of paradox built into the movie. The only hope for mankind is a return to fertility. Yet what we see of mankind doesn't reflect well upon it. With all social niceties being eliminated, there seems to be nothing left of government but a horde of uniformed murderous fascists. Judge Learned Hand said, 'A society in which men recognize no check on their freedom soon becomes a society where freedom is the possession of only a savage few.' In this world, everyone appears intent on killing everyone else in order to be among the savage few. The writers should have challenged some of their own assumptions. Look at what Homo sapiens has accomplished -- in 2027 and now. Do we really want to start it all over again? Is the Earth better off for our presence on it?",4,9,12,26 February 2013
Million Dollar Baby," Ponderous, not at all bad.
","Clint Eastwood has earned the satisfaction he seems to get out of making leisurely, moody pieces like this, instead of the drive-in kinds of mindless commercial properties he once had to produce to satisfy his bankers. He has enough ambition and talent to do without the orang-utans.You can tell this is one of his more arty enterprises by the darkness, the shadows, the chiaroscuro. People work out in his gym with all the lights but one turned off so they cast dramatic shadows on the peeling cinder-block walls. We can tell that it's Morgan Freeman lurking in the gloom because a single strip of light falls across his eyes. Even hospital rooms are lighted as if they were the interiors of cathedrals.The score, by Eastwood, is a simple one. A melancholy falling arpeggio on a guitar or piano, perfectly predictable except for the final note, which hovers in the air for a long moment before resolving the progression. The theme is not triumph over aimlessness, as in 'Rocky,' but guilt. Eastwood is Frankie, a fight manager who feels responsible for his pal Morgan Freeman's losing his eye in a bout. The movie begins with Frankie twitting a priest after mass, provoking him into saying the f word. Frankie's been attending mass every Sunday for more than 20 years but the priest can't figure out why because Frankie lies and blasphemes all the time. It isn't until the end of the movie that we realize exactly how guilt-prone Franky is. He's afraid to push his fighters ahead too fast for fear they'll be hurt, the way Freeman was hurt, and so when his best fighters are fully trained they leave him for more aggressive managers. Frankie's final act of mercy involves such a monumental breach of ordinary ethics that the weight of his responsibility now makes it impossible for him to carry on with his previous life. He disappears overnight, without a trace, with leaving a puff of smoke. A minute-long coda tacked on leaves an unnecessary, unrealistic taste of optimism in the mouth, along with some homemade lemon-meringue that's gone slightly off.It's curious, but as Eastwood has aged he's come to resemble the aging Henry Fonda more than ever -- tall, gangling stiff, slightly kyphotic, his voice changed into a hoary whisper.His performance is okay, and so is Hilary Swank's. Morgan Freeman narrates and plays an avuncular observer, doing the interpreting for us, filling in the gaps in the narrative, a fine actor. The prize ought to go to Margo Martindale (?) as Swank's redneck selfish unfeeling Mom. What a picture of pure e-vil.If there's a weakness in the film, that Fitzgerald family is probably the most prominent. The other characters are mostly multidimensional, but not Swank's family members. They're mainly there to illustrate the point that if Swank doesn't box, she has absolutely nothing to live for. It would be a better movie if Swank's family had been more nearly human -- maybe polite and grateful, but not unhappy at her estrangement. As it is, the family is drive-in baggage, though well acted.The boxing part is a little different from that of 'Rocky.' Rocky already knows how to box. He just doesn't care. Swank cares a great deal but knows nothing, so the few lessons we see her getting are instructive. (In 'Champion', Kirk Douglas didn't know how to box and he didn't care either.) Watching those brutal boxing scenes would have prompted me to wonder what it was like to be beaten to a pulp by a woman, if I didn't already know. They don't show much in the way of either realism or artistry. No blank spots in the bouts. It's either, Pow, right in the snot-locker, or, Whiz, a great big miss. And every fight ends in a knockout. Ah, well. It's not really a movie about boxing anyway.Another thing might be mentioned. Eastwood has always tried to build a part for an African-American or other minority in his films, starting early with Albert Popwell. But these characters are never condescended to. They're not sentimentalized, ennobled, or otherwise politically corrected. They're treated like anybody else. And Eastwood hasn't been afraid to challenge himself on screen with fine performers either. Here (and elsewhere) he's used Morgan Freeman, than whom there is no finer actor on the screen today. Watch Freeman play the hilarious scene about his day socks and his night socks, while staring distractedly out the window. Eastwood gets extra points for taking risks like that.This is a tragedy, but a pretty good one.",7,4,6,12 January 2006
Donnie Brasco," Tribalism
","SPOILERS.I'm fully prepared to trash Mafia movies because they've been coming out with so many of them over the last 30 years or so that they could easily be organized into a college course like, 'Deviant Behavior 201: La Cosa Nostra.' The problem is that some of them are pretty good, like 'Donnie Brasco.' And why not? Many of them involve the services of such talented Italian-Americans as Francis Ford Coppola, Martin Scorcese, Mario Puzo, Robert DeNiro, Al Pacino, Brian De Palma, and Roger Corman. They tend to occur in two types. The Sensasionalistic Type (or what we call 'Type I') are usually historical in nature and center on a Big Man, usually Al Capone, and/or an historical event, usually The St. Valentine's Day Massacre. The Ethographic Type (or 'Type II') tries to give us an insider's view of Mafia social dynamics, introducing us to how things work around here, so to speak, like a training film. Thus, for instance, 'He's my friend,' means 'I vouch for him and if he fouls up, I die.' But 'He's a friend of ours,' means, 'He's a made man, a member in good standing, and if you touch him, you die.''Donnie Brasco', based on an at least partially true story, gives us a lot of the insiders' codes -- but we already know most of them from reading, from the History Channel, or from previous movies. ('The Valachi Papers' was a nice introduction.) The film makers of 'Donnie Brasco' know that we know, so some of the codes -- the expressions ('Fuggedaboudit'), the amusing nicknames (Anthony 'The Entymologist' Guglielmo) -- are treated as jokes to the audience. And 'Donnie Brasco' DOES have its amusing moments.But it deals too with what I'm forced to call a 'theme.' The values of the particular social world we belong to are always a little in conflict with the values of society at large. Maybe we occasionally do drugs with friends, although most people disapprove and it's against the law, after all. That sort of thing. Now multiply those discrepancies by a high value number and you are in the position of an FBI informer who infiltrates the Mafia and gets to know and finally respect at least some of them. Do you really want to blow the whistle on a trusting friend who's behavior is criminal only about 1 percent of the time? How about if he really LIKES you and promotes you in the group? And has cancer in his family? And, in his own peculiar way, is a man of principle?The movie makes it easy for us to identify with Depp as the informer, and with Pacino as his mentor, and to some extent with the intimate social world of the Mafia as well. They are earthy and passionate and colorful. They eat, drink, make love, and swear with gusto. Society at large is represented by the FBI, a bunch of bloodless freaks if there ever was one. They look like computer nerds and talk like IRS auditors. When Brasco betrays the mob, which leads to the death of his friend and mentor, the FBI present him with a medal and a check for five-hundred dollars. The ceremony is perfunctory, brief, and nobody attends. A picture is taken of Depp with the measely check that has cost Pacino his life. After what the movie has shown us, the guy must have felt like a minor-league Judas.A lot of people seem to feel that Depp's performance was outstanding, but I thought it was competent, not much more. Maybe I'm missing something. Pacino is marvelous, though. His voice has become a rough gargle and he is old enough to look, not defeated, but thoughtful about his losses. Just right for the role. The support includes Zeljko Ivanek, also excellent in the part of an FBI agent. I wish more use would be made of him because he's a fine actor, but I suppose he'll have to change his name to something more spellable before he hits the big time. Anne Heche is competent too. She's acquired a thin but nice New York accent here. Her skeletal structure is gracile. And her features, even her prominent nose, look delicate and vulnerable. Michael Madsen is a nice gentle guy, but he makes a great screen heavy, of the thuggish type, not the caddish type. Worth seeing.",Null,2,4,5 September 2004
Casualties of War," Maybe De Palma's Best
","It's the only film of De Palma's that I've seen that doesn't imitate Hitchcock, engage in shameless self indulgence, or pander to its audience. ('Pander.'  Interesting word, from a character in Chaucer who acted as a sexual intermediary.)  This is structured more like a three-act play than a traditional movie.  (1) Fox is introduced to the other members of his squad and gets in a fire fight.  (2)  The squad kidnap a girl, take her into the bush, rape her and kill her, and engaged in another fire fight.  (3)  Fox tries to blow the whistle but the higher up the ladder he goes, the more angry the resistance becomes, until he finally sees the four criminals brought to trial. 
It is not an epic war movie full of majestic music and heroic acts and a cast of thousands, but it belongs up there with 'Platoon' and the others. It's quite well done.The acting is uniformly good.  Fox is fine as a short, shiny faced, humanitarian newbie who answers to a higher authority than he can find easily in the military chain of command.  Penn adopts a New York accent that is so thick that it's sometimes hard to follow, but he puts a lot of energy into the role of sergeant, almost to the point of hamminess.  His men are well-differentiated by the script -- one a savage and stupid killer, one a remorseful Hispanic, and another newly arrived grunt who goes along willingly because he's been led to believe that this is the way things are done.  The Vietnamese girl is as good as any of the men.  She appears in two roles, as the victim and, later, as a college student who has a brief, understanding exchange with Fox.In many ways this is a far more shocking movie than any that De Palma has come up with, before or since.  The girl is beautiful, fine-boned, and has long black Asian hair with reddish highlights.  Her suffering during the trek into the bush, in her bare feet, carrying the men's gear on her bleeding back, is palpable.  After being gang banged she huddles in a dark corner and sobs abjectly.  Fox approaches her and she is jolted upward with fear.  And we see not the face of the pretty young girl but a battered bloody swollen toothless mask.  The scene is light years away from Angie Dickinson getting slashed with a razor in an elevator while the audience thrills.There is another scene that is outstanding, a kind of denouement.  Fox is drunk and is queried by a friendly chaplain.  Having been ignored before, he spills out his hopeless story once again.  De Palma dissolves from Fox's stricken face to the court martial of the four men.  It's another shocker, the more effective for not being underlined.  Instead of the four men we have seen before, sweating and unkempt, in dirty fatigues, swearing abominably and threatening Fox, we see them cleaned up in starched kakhis, wearing their campaign ribbons and insignia.  And we are forced to the realization that these murderers and rapists, whom we have taken to be nothing more than an anarchic group of bums, are in fact representatives of the U. S. Army and are subject to its laws.  (De Palma doesn't show the court itself, just the defendants responding to questions.)  They have changed, and yet not changed.  The uncomprehending stupdity remains, and the simmering desperation.  Penn's sergeant is only twenty years old.The scene with the Vietnamese student at the end is a necessary catharsis. Fox is on a train and after she gets off, he notices that she has left a scarf behind.  He retrieves the scarf and hurries after her, calling out in Vietnamese.  She smiles and asks him, 'Do I remind you of someone?'  His distress becomes plain, and she guesses its source and asks, 'Did you have a bad dream?  I think it's over now.'  Brief but touching.De Palma should get a decoration too because he has disregarded his cheesier tendencies as a director.  Another De Palma might have handled that rape scene quite differently, as an opportunity for the audience to identify with the rapists and a chance to display some succulent female flesh.  (Here are her nipples.  See how purple they look?)  But not here.  It's a movie made by a grown up, for grown ups.",Null,37,47,7 May 2004
"Good Night, and Good Luck."," Surprisingly low key docudrama.
","I approached this film warily. Here you've got George Clooney as writer and director and actor, and who IS George Clooney? A self-proclaimed liberal with a background in afternoon television dramas. He's made a movie about a shameful episode in America's past in which lives were ruined and there were few heroes. And the movie focuses on Edward R. Murrow, who is widely acknowledged as among the first and most deserving of those heroes.Well -- look out, now! I figured we were due for a colorful, bombastic civics lesson with every point underscored and overwritten.But, nope. Instead, Clooney has come up with a low-key black-and-white drama about Murrow that shows him as mirthless and doesn't dig into his personal life to give him a more human, hale-fellow-well-met identity. We don't even know where he's from. David Strathairn doesn't smile once. Here's Murrow, warts and all. He doesn't come across as much of an idealist either. He's strictly a newsman. Neither he, nor his able supporting cast, give a single speech about freedom of the press or due process. Only once, in one or two sentences, does he dig in his heels when negotiating with his boss, Bill Paley, about the show. He asks Paley what he wants. Paley replies that he doesn't want to get a bellyache from not knowing what's going to happen next on Murrow's show. And Murrow replies evenly, 'Well, Bill, that's the price you have to pay.' The threat of firings and resignations linger unspoken in the air.So -- totally against my expectations -- the story isn't hyped at all. There are no speeches fulminating against McCarthyism. (I don't think the word 'McCarthyism' is even used. Maybe it should have been. Recent polls show that most high school students believe Watergate took place before 1900.) No dramatic music, no music at all except occasional inserts presumably taken from Columbia Records which CBS operated. Even the suicide of one of the news staff's colleagues is short and silent. And nobody says anything afterward about what a great guy Dan Hollenbeck was, although we see Murrow mention him briefly at the end of a broadcast. Murrow paid for his freedom of speech with a commitment to 'Person To Person' interviews with celebrities. They were supposed to be like Robert Oppenheimer but instead they became Liberace. Note when the lights go out after the Liberace visit and Strathairn looks up and rolls his eyes slightly.Murrow smoked all the time and died of lung cancer. Yet the film ends at a party given in Murrow's honor, a tribute. A cheaper approach would have followed Murrow through his medical exams, his death bed speeches, his funeral, the rousing perorations of his colleagues -- but the film has none of that.In fact, the movie seems to have been deliberately stripped of every quality that might give it commercial appeal. No one shouts at anyone else. No one gets angry. No one swears. People don't fight or have hot sex. Nobody wrenches anybody else's head off and spits down the neck cavity. This damps the drama. I'm not sure how much appeal this film actually had, except for older people, or for people comfortable enough in their skins to absorb a message that isn't pounded into them -- a dwindling few, I'm afraid. How many young people know who McCarthy was or what he did? It's the kind of movie that demands the viewer's attention. It doesn't compromise. 'LA Confidential,' a fine movie in its own right, is set in the same period as this movie. But in 'LA Confidential,' nobody smokes. Why not? Presumably it would turn off some more-than-usually moral people in the audience who would interpret it as a promotion for tobacco smoking. In 'Good Night, and Good Luck,' just about everybody smokes cigarettes. Why? Because just about everybody smoked cigarettes in 1952, that's why. That's what I mean by 'uncompromising.' If you watch this, don't expect to be led by the hand through the evils of overzealous patriotism. Condemnation and imprisonment for reasons kept secret are taken for granted as wrong. President Eisenhower is seen on TV speaking briefly about habeus corpus. Many of us seem to have forgotten the meaning of the term or the dangers of ignoring due process.That last sentence I wrote is more preachy than anything you'll find in this film. Clooney is no Oliver Stone. He trusts the viewer to be able to distinguish good from evil, and it's very flattering to find a writer/director willing to do that.",8,1,2,21 May 2007
Mulholland Drive," Betty and Veronica Go To the Dark Side.
","So many people seem puzzled by this film but I don't know why. The interpretation is clear enough.You see, the thing is, the apartment manager Coco (Miller) is simply dreaming that she is Betty (Watts) who is in turn dreaming that she is Rita (Harring). Near the beginning of the film, when the amnesic Rita lies down in the dark and goes to sleep, she dreams that she is the director's mother (Miller) and -- AT THE SAME TIME -- out of penis envy she also takes the role of the director (Theroux) so that she can have sex with the person she loves most in the world -- herself. (You don't really think that masturbation scene is in there just for the fun of it, do you?) The heuristic skeleton key rests on one simple and indisputable fact. The two dreams -- Miller's and Rita's -- interact with one another. For the simple minded this might prove a problem, but I'm sure Jung would have had no problem with it. Of course Jung was a madman, but still -- Well, I won't go on with this because I don't want to spoil anyone's pleasure by spelling everything out. Let me just say that the topper is this: I MYSELF dreamed this entire movie last night after a dish of chili to which, I admit, a few too many habanero peppers might have been added. Does that explain it for you? Or do I need to draw you a picture.Actually, all seriousness aside, we can at least guess at the meaning. My guess would be that Betty (or Diane) came to LA, fell for a leading actress who managed to get her small parts, and got jealous when the actress fell for the director. So she hired someone to knock off the actress but somehow the deal was made public and when the cops came for her she shot herself. That's my guess. Honest.Whatever else one can say about the movie, this is a true original. Nobody but David Lynch would have dared to make it. It is two and a half hours of absolutely gripping and unfathomable meandering. An exercise in style that probably won't appeal to everyone, but a work of committed art nonetheless. (Who understands Finnegans Wake, another dream?) What Quentin Tarrantino did to chronology in 'Pulp Fiction,' Lynch does here, only some of the out-of-synch sequences are fantasies. Each of the dozen or so semi-episodes is related to the others in some way and each scene is intact and comprehensible unto itself but, related or not, the scenes don't quite match one another logically. (Eg., before the credits we see a frenetic bunch of jitterbuggers which has nothing to do with the story until the end, when we learn that Watts got into performing after winning a jitterbug contest in Ontario.) Like a poem in sprung rhythm each line fits perfectly but is discordant. Naomi Watts. How come Australia has been fielding all these succulent blonds? Where do they get them from? She is perfect for the part. When she arrives in L.A. she is breathless with excitement. She has this gracile frame and wide gray eyes and two big childlike incisors and is given to phrases like, 'I couldn't afford this place in a million years.' And, 'Everything is A-Okay.' And 'Wow!' She seems so pale and vulnerable and naive that one senses she could be easily squished. She's perfectly believable as Nancy Drew and later, when she is the bitter, discarded lover, she's STILL believable in a darker, spiteful way.I just saw it for the second time, expecting to be bored, but couldn't get away from the screen. Every scene had something new and ominous in it. A singer in the club Silencio, belting out a song in Spanish and a cappella that I didn't recognize as 'Cryin'' until it was almost over. I wondered if Ray Orbison in plus time and minus space could recognize it. The trumpeter was Conti Condoli, a fantastic jazz musician (for a white guy) who has played with Stan Kenton and Doc Severison and has his own recognizable style. No hay mejor! His brother Pete's pretty good too. The sound department also deserves plaudits for meeting the considerable demands placed on it by the film. The score will make your woofer tremble.There's a little humor in it, not much. Dog doody on the tiles. Two scenes involving Theroux's wife.Okay, I think there is at least one thing we can all agree on. This is CHAD EVERETT's best performance in years.Why do we give awards to semi-moronic blockbusters like 'Titanic' and 'Pearl Harbor' and ignore the recklessly innovative work of directors like the Coens and Lynch? If you miss this, you will be missing a lot.",9,5,10,10 April 2006
The Boy in the Striped Pajamas," Stark Tragedy.
","Bruno (Asa Butterfield) is the eight-year-old son of the commandant of a Nazi death camp. Shmuel (Jack Scanlon) is a prisoner of the same age. The two boys meet on opposite sides of the barbed wire fence that encloses the camp. Thus, the set up for endless banalities.You have to be very careful in dealing with the genocidal program of the Nazis because the historical events are so moving that they are easily exploited and cheapened. And you have to be careful with children on screen. They're so often childish. They so often seem to be there in order to be abused or get sick and need a kidney transplant.These are onerous problems, but this movie manages them fairly well until the very end.We see a relatively normal German family through the eyes of Bruno. Dad (David Thewless) is a little distant, perhaps, by our standards, but Mom (Vera Farmiga) is in charge of the kids anyway. Kinder, Kirche, Kuchen, you know? Dad is mostly around to make major decisions regarding the household.Their house is in the countryside, far from home, but near the prison camp. Alone and friendless, Bruno wanders through the woods until he meets and befriends Shmuel. He asks Shmuel the kinds of questions an inquisitive eight-year-old might ask. 'Why are you wearing striped pajamas?' Bruno begins to question his father's probity too, which is always a bad idea, especially in a traditional German family, especially when Dad is an Obersturmbannfuhrer in the SS and is killing and cremating Jews, like little Shmuel, by the thousands.It's well photographed and nicely acted. The lead performances are fine. David Thewless isn't presented as a bald, bespectacled monster. And Vera Farmiga, with her strangely askew features, does a nice turn as the mother who discovers, all at once, that people are being murdered next door.Some of the moments are more expectable than others. When Shmuel is discovered in some mischief, he's hustled off by a stern SS officer for a talking to. The next time Bruno meets Shmuel at the fence, Shmuel's head is down -- and we know instantly at the shot that when he lifts his face it will be battered. That's pretty cheap.In fact, except for the family dynamics and the colloquy between Bruno and Shmuel, the trajectory of the plot is fairly predictable, at least until the very end when it falls apart completely.It's unbelievable that Bruno could get a gander at a propaganda film produced by his father, portraying the camp as a kind of Club Med resort with games and music -- and still believe it. He has, after all, been talking at length with an inmate. It's even less believable that Bruno and Shmuel would giggle with delight as Bruno transforms himself into an inmate and crawls under the fence only a few minutes before the two of them, along with a horde of others, are swept up for extermination.We see Farmiga reduced to hysterical weeping and Thewless stone-faced and distraught, as if, 'There, that will teach them a lesson about humanity.' It would have been more realistic and ending, more demanding, and equally tragic, if Bruno had said good-bye to Shmuel for the last time and left with his mother and sister for the safety of Heidelberg. The existing ending is too easy. Moral lessons aren't forced on us with such easy drama in life. As it is, the fundamentally decent Farmiga has learned nothing, and the self-disciplined Thewless will never admit to the evil he does.",6,9,18,23 March 2010
The Imitation Game," Secrets, All Kinds of Secrets.
","It's difficult to show Benedict Cumberbatch, as Alan Turing, trying to figure out how to break the German Enigma code during World War II, just as it's difficult to show the effort being put into any cognitive enterprise. That's the trouble with making movies about writers, puzzle solvers, and chess players. You can't show them as action figures, shooting up a place, killing enemies by the thousands, wrenching heads off. The result is that you wind up concentrating on the drama of the personality itself. The protagonist's social relations, his triumphs and tribulations, his strengths and weaknesses.This one begins in 1951 with the oddball Cumberbatch dismissing the police from his room after an apparent break in, but we're soon back to 1939, with Cumberbatch newly out of Cambridge and recruited by 'MI-6', which doesn't exist and is devoted to the breaking of Enigma at the famous Bletchley Park. The introductory scenes are sometimes amusing. Cumberbatch, always polite, seems to have no sense of humor and interprets expressions literally. His handful of colleagues stand up at noon and ask if Cumberbatch is hungry too. 'Yes, I'm hungry, he replies, but he doesn't get up and join them because no one asked him to. They only asked him if he was hungry. When a colleague comes up with a useful suggestion, his way of saying thank you is, 'That's not an entirely terrible idea.'His artlessness is taken for arrogance and he's generally disliked except for one of his brilliant young colleagues, Keira Knightley. (Lucky him.) He likes her too but not for her contours because he turns out to be a pouf. That was a serious crime in England until 1967.Instead of trying to figure out how Enigma's decoding machine worked -- Polish scientists had brought one to England -- he decided to build a machine that would defeat the machine. Promoted to head of the department at Bletchley, he recruited more members for his team by publishing a crossword puzzle in the newspapers. 'If you can solve this puzzle in ten minutes or less call this number for an exciting and rewarding career.' And the tradition of British crossword puzzles is that they are notoriously hard. 'Name a seed you put in the garage.' (Caraway.) 'Name a major seaport in the middle of Czechoslovakia.' (Oslo.) Those are examples from a recent edition of the London Times.The head honcho at MI-6 despises Cumberbatch and his gang and is just about to shut the whole affair down when there occurs a 'Man in the White Suit' moment. Bingo. The first German encrypted message is disencrtyped by Enigma which, with a bang, turns from a huge, noisy, whirling machine into a silent and obedient servant, standing at attention and waiting for more orders. It IS a big machine too, affectionately named Christopher. It would take up half a garage. I'm glad they didn't go too deeply -- or at all, in fact -- into decoding. I never got past Sherlock Holmes and the Dancing Men.Cumberbatch does fine by the role of the eccentric Alan Turing. He's extremely amusing when he's trying to humanize himself by telling a joke that he doesn't really get. Keira Knightley is Keira Knightly, she of the exquisite iliac crests. Nobody in the supporting cast delivers a weak performance.The story switches without any jolts between 1928, 1941, and 1951, and it follows a familiar trajectory. Someone who is a genius at something, whether maths, the trumpet, or baseball, fights inner demons and is almost destroyed by them. Or sometimes, as here, is himself destroyed.",7,1,2,24 May 2015
The Adjustment Bureau," What It's All About.
","In the post-war period, when existentialism was in flower, everybody was reciting Jean-Paul Sartre: 'Existence precedes essence,' meaning you can do and be anything you want, as long as you're willing to accept the consequences of your choice.That's what this movie is about. There is this supernatural entity called The Adjustment Bureau -- represented by unsmiling guys wearing hats -- that determines your future by arranging incidents that bring that future about.Take Matt Damon's character. He's a very low-level politician but there's a presidency in his future if the Adjustment Bureau has its way. That's his essence, so to speak. They manipulate events so that he accidentally bumps into Emily Blunt, who inspires him to give a candid speech that increases his political hooper rating.As far as the bureau is concerned, that's it. Blunt's purpose is fulfilled. She made him give a good speech. Now she's supposed to disappear from his life because HER destiny is to become a world-famous ballerina. If she and Damon were to hook up, it would spoil the bureau's plans for both of them. Damon would wind up an Alderman and she would teach dance to six-year-olds.But Damon has his own ideas about where he's going and he fights the bureau's plans. It's HE who will determine his essence, and that of Blunt as well.It sounds a little complicated, and it is. The writer/director is George Nolfi, an intelligent and perceptive artist. He's maybe a little too sophisticated for most audiences. The Chairman of the bureau -- presumably some sort of divine presence -- is referred to but never shown, except symbolically by sunshine. That's one example of the kind of symbolism that escaped my apperceptive apparatus. I only learned about it, and about other details and intentions, from the director's commentary on the DVD.Actually, it confused the hell out of me. Not just the symbolism. Damon seems to fall in love with Blunt after a five-minute bout of banter with her. Then he drifts in and out of her life over a period of years, rescuing her at the last minute from marriage to someone else. The romance seemed forced rather than organic, although it's needed because it provides the source of conflict between the bureau's desires and Damon's individualism. It almost devolves into an examination of free will which, in a way, I guess it is.It would have been a more successful movie if -- and you can't imagine how much I hate saying this -- if it had been slightly dumbed down.",5,2,2,20 July 2016
World Trade Center," Nothing special, alas.
","The director, Oliver Stone, labored under multiple handicaps in bringing this story of two trapped Port Authority policemen to the screen. First of all, the narrative is hindered by the constraints of reality. Nothing of much cinematic impact really happened during the attacks on the twin towers. Two airplanes crash into the towers, then a few hours later, kaboom, and the rest is rescue and recovery. It's inherently undramatic.And there were probably a myriad heroes but no single individual strapped to the mast, singing out, 'Damn the torpedoes! Full speed ahead!' So there can be no hero. And there can't be any villains either. Nobody knew who was behind the attacks at the time. And if you exclude the jihadists, what's left? Kirk Douglas' egomaniacal reporter in 'Ace in the Hole'? In other words, you have a film about two PAPD officers immobilized in the rubble, able only to speak to one another, and there follow the kind of clichés you expect from a war movie. The pregnant wife at home, vomiting at the news, and declaring that she will give her unborn child the name her husband wanted. Flashbacks to happy home lives, when the trapped husbands gave their sons instructions on the use of a saw, beaming at their wives. A Marine inspired by a visit to his church who plunges into the rescue effort. And it gets worse. When an officer dies, he sees the tunnel of light with Christ at the end. (What if he'd been a Jew?) A shame, really. The weakness of the drama is not compensated for by spectacular scenes of buildings collapsing -- which is probably a good thing, because that way lies just another disaster movie. More telling is the absence of any exploration of the systemic response to the catastrophe. One of the problems plaguing the rescue efforts was that the NYPD and the NY Fire Department had radios tuned to different frequencies and so were unable to communicate with one another. By the end, first responders were communicating through 911, the emergency phone number. By the way, is that fixed now? It ought to be gripping and it's not really. Two men trapped in the dark rubble, one PR and one WASP, and we pretty much know what they think and feel. Ditto for their families. What many would like to know is what's going on upstairs.To Stone's credit, his narrative is straightforward, with no editorial razzle dazzle. Not a sign of self indulgence. And it seems like a genuine attempt at drama, not greedy cashing in on public interest in the events.The two men are rescued and of course any viewer is glad. It was a catastrophe. And the catastrophe has deepened. It's sadder now than it was on 9/11. We've spent half again as many lives as were lost on 9/11 in the fruitless pursuit of some ill-defined vengeance. And a dozen times more Americans have been maimed. On 9/12, most of the newspapers across Europe and the rest of the world ran headlines like, 'Today We Are All Americans.' I doubt that sentiment still prevails. We've lost more than anyone could have predicted.",2,3,4,11 September 2007
Black Snake Moan," Dual Redemption.
","Christina Ricci is a nymphomaniac in a small Southern town. That's a good start right there. In her previous films I found myself so wound up in her broad forehead, Walter Keane eyes, and tiny lips and mental process that I never realized she had a figure. But that she does, and it's pretty much on display here. She spends half the movie running around in the remnants of a polo shirt and a pair of tiny underpants that emphasize her pubic symphisis. A soupcon of bondage too, for those interested in such things.She's more or less engaged to Justin Timberlake who is often away on National Guard assignments, including combat in the Middle East. He's a good soldier but he gets buck fever when he has to shoot at another human being. When he's out of town she floods out with testosterone. One night her lovers take her to a woodland, beat the hell out of her, and leave her lying unconscious in the grass.Samuel L. Jackson is a blues-playing Jesus-driven guitarist who has alienated his estrange wife and now lives alone in a generic wooden shack on a dirt road. He finds Ricci, picks her up, and takes her home.So far, so formulaic. We immediately think that somehow Jackson is going to 'cure' Ricci. And he DOES. But there are many twists and turns along the way. Jackson comes to realize that you can't dominate others' lives, which is presumably what cost him his family. Ricci overcomes her nymphomania. Timberlake conquers his rage when he finds out everyone in town has been doing his girl friend when he's away, and he winds up marrying her, though still burdened by anxiety attacks. We all feel, as the couple drive away to start a new life, that she will help him find peace.I wasn't surprised at Jackson's superior performance as a rickety and crotchety old man. He's always fine. And this role is a challenge. He must project both a protective impulse towards Ricci and at the same time an uncontrollable desire to exercise power over her. He chains her to a radiator in his shack and keeps her captive -- for her own good. Well, that's the sort of thing he expect from the heavy in an ordinary slasher movie. What comes next -- the torture? The branding with red-hot pokers? But the writers and the actor keep it clean. It's still a tough role though. Ricci in her minimalist clothing keeps offering herself to Jackson -- 'If you want me you can have me. I'll do anything you want.' Of course, he brushes off her advances, as any normal eunuch would.Ricci's performance is pretty good too and that was a bit of a surprise because I'd never seen her do much more than hit her marks before. But then she's never really had a chance to play such a flamboyant Lulubelle before, or to take off all her clothes for that matter.Justin Timberlake doesn't have a very large role but he's not bad at doing rage and anxiety. Or rather 'anxiety', because it seems clear the writers have never had anxiety attacks as I've had. Yet the writing and the direction is subtle enough to suggest the kind of thing that precipitates anxiety attacks, what shrinks call 'low-probability catastrophes.' For example, on their final getaway in the car, Timberlake is driving slowly, as anxiety neurotics are want to do, and is being passed by one of those loud, threatening eighteen-wheelers loaded with timber. The monster truck takes an agonizingly long time to pass in the outer lane, sometimes appearing to slow down to the speed of Timberlake's own sluggish vehicle. Meanwhile another loud monster with a grill the size of a king-sized box spring has pulled up behind him, its air horn screaming. Stuck between threats, Timberlake adjusts the rear-view mirror nervously a few times then tells Ricci he has to pull off onto the shoulder. The symptoms may not be right, but the trigger and the behavior are spot on.The musical score is steeped in blues played on an electric guitar, and I found it lugubrious and ultimately tiresome. 'Shot a man in Memphis -- bullet hole in his haid.' Well, not that. The lyrics actually underline the development of the characters. I also wish the writers hadn't thoughtlessly thrown in the abuse excuse for Ricci's nymphomania. As if it were that simple.Something else I'm compelled to add. If I don't, nobody will get it. In the third sentence above, both the words 'mental' and 'process' are puns. They have independent meanings in anatomy and psychology, and both usages are apt. I'd pat myself on the back if I could reach it but I really can't claim credit. The voices tell me these things. The movie's pace is a bit slow too, but it's obvious that a good deal of effort has gone into it. Not badly done.",6,1,2,18 January 2009
Black Hawk Down," Mission Impossible
","This is a very difficult film to evaluate. I'm not sure exactly how closely the narrative follows the historical facts, for one thing. Certainly some of the dialog is fictional, but it's less the dialog than the layout of the situation that needs to be understood, and the movie is weak on that point. One of the docuchannels, perhaps Discovery, showed a two-hour special on this incident, shortly after the movie was released. The documentary is a lot easier to understand than the movie itself. I emphasize historical accuracy because the rest of the film is fairly competent and doesn't need much in the way of comment. No real acting is called for. The photography is adequate, tinted beige with flying dust during daylight sequences, almost as much as silent films might have been, and a sort of sickly green at night. I had a very hard time keeping up with the location of the various units, or remnants of units, and with just exactly who was who, except for Sam Shepherd who is easily identifiable. The special effects were up to what one would expect of an expensive modern movie. There was an abundance of realistic gore, of bullets clanking off metal, and so forth. Maybe a bit too much. It was inevitable that 'Saving Private Ryan' would initiate a new level of graphic violence.The movie delineates four groups of people. (1) The heroic American elite units, Rangers and Delta Force. (2) The villainous, practically cannibalistic rabble of the Somali 'militia.' (3) The resentful and reluctantly cooperative Pakistanis. And (4) the Somali civilians who are suffering the most.It's a brave film because its subject is an uninvited intervention in a remote anarchistic country done for humanitarian reasons, and it was a failure. We were supposed to relieve starvation and introduce order into a social universe of moral nihilism. I remember feeling that we were going to have trouble getting along in this place that nobody had ever heard of when clips were shown on TV news of Marines standing guard on trucks that were trundling along the unpaved streets. A handful of laughing skinny kids were running alongside the trucks and knocking cartons of food off into the dust. The angry Marines, used to more discipline, were swatting and shouting at the children. For the first few days, the 'militia' lay low. ('Militia' is in quotes because they weren't militia, just warring factions led by charismatic leaders.) After they realized they weren't going to be annihilated, that the UN actually DIDN'T intend to kill everyone and take over, they emerged from hiding doing what they did best, running around with automatic weapons, often mounted on the beds of old pick-ups, and shooting at one another. Well, this was what we had come to stop, right? According to respectable reports in the New Yorker and elsewhere, it was decided on our part that the biggest nuisance of all was one particular warlord. He, out of many contenders, was identified as the 'enemy' and it was seen as necessary to arrest him, if we could find him first. The search and the attempt at capture, which this movie depicts, seems largely to have been done out of rage and frustration. Well, we didn't get the guy we were after, since this wasn't fiction. And we lost eighteen American men (all enlisted men), and the Pakistanis lost two dozen as well, though the film doesn't mention it.I was gripped by the movie from beginning to end. What I took away from it was a feeling that there are simply some missions that are impossible. After all, our most highly trained troops took high tech weapons of all sorts and deployed them against a horde of disorganized hostiles armed with nothing more than small arms and grenades launchers. And we sent our men into a country in which little laughing kids could PO the Marines, a country we understood nothing about, against an 'enemy' that ourselves had defined, in a city in which we didn't know our way around. George F. Will put it very well: 'We have no obligation to do that which is impossible.'The Gulf War of course was a much larger military enterprise. And when we think of the last war we fought, we think of our overwhelming victory there. I wish that every living person who hungers for war at this moment could see 'Blackhawk Down' so that they could envisage a different scenario, a different set of scenes than our airplanes bombing missile bases amidst pretty fireworks, our tanks blowing the hatches off those of the bad guys. It's possible that instead of ending in a quick victory, our next military intervention may end up tragically, more of a bloody nose than an adrenalin rush.",9,1,3,7 December 2002
Prisoners," Crime Story For Adults.
","There is a scene in 'On Dangerous Ground' (1951) in which half-crazy detective Robert Ryan is about to beat the living crap out of a suspect to gain information. Ryan's features twist into a pustule of hate, hardly human. 'Why do you DO it? Why do you punks make me DO it?' And then he goes frantically to work.This is a a more complex story of the kidnapping of two little girls and the lengths to which the parents and police are willing to go to either retrieve the victims or find the bodies. But the most complicated character, the father who engages our interest because he instrumentalizes his grief and anger (Jackman), does more or less what Ryan does in the earlier film. He goes berserk, tramples on the law, and reduces a half-wit that he suspects to a bloody pulp.There are harmonies in the sometimes torpid story that I didn't quite get or wasn't sure of. There are ominous organ chords, a drunken priest who is a red herring, and references to penance. There's a candle light vigil for the girls. It's deep enough, even without any spiritual content. After all, when you get right down to it, the question raised by Jackman's tactics is: 'How far is it ethical to go in torturing a prisoner, even in a good cause?' It's a medieval issue but recently a more contemporary one.It's a long movie -- too long, really -- and it could have benefited from more ruthless cutting, yet it all adds up. The director, Villeneuve, effectively captures the drab aspects of working-class life in one of those flat, brick, ranch-type residential neighborhoods on the outskirts of a small town in Pennsylvania, actually shot in Georgia.The acting is, well, hard to describe in a word but maybe 'naturalistic' will do. It's something like 'All The President's Men' in that respect. The kidding around and the hesitations and interruptions don't sound as if they were being read from cue cards.Jackman is fine as the enraged father who is determined to beat a confession out of his retarded prisoner, but he's not a sadist. He doesn't ENJOY doing it. And the scenes are truncated, avoiding the nasty current affection for torture porn that has infected movies like 'Unthinkable' or the unbearable 'The Killing Gene.' The viewer is likely to be 'for' or 'against' the other characters but Jackman's is problematic. He's not just rude or irrational. He's brutal. It's what makes it the most interesting role.In fact, everyone pulls his or her weight, but Maria Bello is truly impressive, though she doesn't have that much screen time. And Mellisa Leo as the mother of the chief suspect is outstanding. One of those distant, suspicious, kindly authoritative, slightly sour Midwesterners, though she's from New York.The ending collapses in upon itself. People do idiotic things like search dangerous places without calling for back up. Without warning, a familiar character splits open and reveals the demon within. Cliché follows cliché. I still don't exactly understand it. The rest is tense, involving, quite well done.",7,3,4,15 May 2014
The Insider," Warning: Movie May Cause Boredom
","Whether the defendant is a squealer or a whistle blower depends on which side of the social border the judge sits on. If the informant betrays secrets about an organization we support, then he's a squealer or a spy. If we hate the organization, then he's a civic-minded whistle blower. It's kind of like being a 'terrorist' or a 'freedom fighter.'In this case, there's no doubt that Jeffrey Wigand was a flawed but full-blown whistler. He tattled on 'Big Tobacco,' as it's consistently called, a conspiratorial corporate entity everyone hates. What did he have to gain? Not much. He admits to having a bad temper and feels he was fired 'for no good reason,' but for most of us that would be a weak motive for risking your bountiful severance package and your family. (Of course, who knows what's in a man's heart?) There are death threats that show up on his PC and a bullet appears in his mailbox, or so we are told. People may be 'surveilling' him at places like a golf driving range. If so, the surveillers are pretty obvious about it. Writers, and viewers as well, need to be careful with this kind of material. After he was sent to jail, G. Gordon Liddy, a paranoid if there ever was one, describes in his book, 'Will,' how he made killer enemies in prison and concluded that on a given night they were going to make an attempt on his life. He chose bravely to sleep out in the open with a blunt object for defense nearby. Nobody showed up that night. He believes his audacity frightened the killers off, whereas most reasonable readers would suspect that his enemies, like Son of Sam's social life, were all in his head. At any rate, as it turns out, Wigand loses just about everything dear to him.Another brave whistle blower is Lowell Bergman the CBS producer who brings the whole tawdry story to light by blowing the whistle on CBS to the New York Times. He quits his job. (The movie makes it appear that he quits immediately after his victory, whereas in fact he didn't quit until two years later.) The movie is based on Bergman's version of events.The question is: aside from making us feel good because, by means of all this sacrifice Big Tobacco gets it in the chin, what other purpose is served? What startling exposition is there in Wigand's suppressed interview? Certainly not that cigarettes are bad for you. The Surgeon General's report demonstrated that in 1964. And even that report was a redundancy since just about everyone, from scientists to morons, knew that cigarettes make you ill. The first use of the term 'coffin nail' or 'nail in your coffin' used in reference to cigarettes appeared in 1888, when cigarettes were just beginning to be used in addition to cigars and pipes. Here's a headline from the Chicago Daily Tribune, 15 July 1897, 'Unconscious From Cigaret Smoke: George Decker of Jersey City Succumbs to an Excessive Use of 'Coffin Tacks.'' (That's from Dictionary of American Regional English.) In Chinese, the character representing 'tobacco' is the same as that for 'opium,' a stylized picture of a man imprisoned by four walls.There is an interesting datum on how ammonia compounds are added to tobacco to facilitate the impact of nicotine -- but that's the whole point of smoking. No one ever claimed that cigarettes TASTED good. Enhancing the impact of nicotine is an example of good old American know-how.At least from what we can see, the two main contributions of the controversial interview are (1) that the CEOs lied when they testified that they did not believe tobacco was an addictive drug, and (2) sound bites -- 'Cigarettes are nothing more than a delivery system for a drug.' (We hear that last bite quoted 3 times.)Well, Big Tobacco (and little tobacco for that matter, if that term can be applied to users) had already been demonized. The whole affair, in all its complexity, seems to have cemented even more firmly in place those prejudices most viewers will already hold. The film was careful not to indict smokers because, after all, these addicts go to the movies. The film poses as an expose, when in fact it has about the same sensational value as the revelation that Benedict Arnold sold West Point to the British.And who wound up paying for all this? Big Tobacco came under a great deal of expensive litigation, and remains there today. Penalties were levied on the corporations. The corporations passed these additional costs on to the users by tripling and quadrupling the cost of cigarettes. Most of the people who are addicted to cigarettes (we're not talking about the conspicuous consumption of expensive cigars) are working and lower class. The result is a regressive tax, in which the chief burden falls on those least able to pay. Forty years ago, a carton of Camels could be had for 90 cents. Today, in New York, you pay between five and six dollars a pack. That's an increase of roughly 6,111 percent. (I think. If that figure's wrong, it's my calculator's fault.)One might think that, having finally brought the addictive properties of nicotine out into the open, the public and its representatives would feel some sympathy, or even pity, for its victims, but no such sentiment has surfaced. The hatred we feel towards smokers seems boundless and almost gleeful. Here's a poster on the door of a professor of social science in an Eastern university: 'Cancer Cures Smoking,' in huge blood-red letters. The last time there was such widespread and righteous wrath must have been during the anti-communist fervor of the early 1950s.In return we have the warm self-satisfied glow that comes from knowing that we rooted for the right side in this really rather simple-minded and exploitative movie.",2,13,28,18 September 2002
Quiz Show," Time's Up
","Why do networks take a decent movie like this and lop off parts to fit it into a Procrustean bed? So they can include more commercials and make money. Why do contestants cheat on TV quiz shows? Well, yes, to make money too -- but more than that. They want adulation as well as new Caddies. At least Herb Stempel and Charles van Doren do -- brothers under two highly unsimilar-looking skins. This movie, at any rate, was chopped up by WGN, and a shame too. I thought networks had gotten pretty much out of the habit. What was lopped off consisted of small but highly revealing character touches, as is usually the case. What's missing from the print here, at least what came to my notice, are two relatively short scenes, whose importance as revealers of character I leave to you to judge. (1) Van Doren has been on the show and become a celebrity and has gotten used to being surrounded by envious and gushing young idolators. He arrives a bit early, before one of the campus buildings discharges its horde of students. And instead of alighting immediately from the cab, he pauses, leans down, and begins fiddling with his shoelace -- until the building opens and disgorges its young people, and then he gets out and is quickly engulfed as a bit of nutrient might be engulfed by a brainless amoeba. (2) Dick Goodwin visits the van Dorens and their guests (Bunny Wilson, etc.)at their Connecticut home, where everyone sits around the picnic table playing a kind of Shakespeare trivia contest. Dad starts a quote and challenges Charles to finish it and identify its source, that sort of thing. The erudite byplay of all concerned is enough to convince Goodwin that nobody from a community like this could be guilty of cheating on a stupid quiz show. The film rolls along with a lot of dash. Redford has a real facility in the use and placement of the camera. After several important exchanges he tends to linger on the face of one of the speakers, usually the one who has just learned something and whose mouth is left slightly open. The score is mostly of contemporary songs and intrudes a bit, seems loud. Charles van Doren may have envied and perhaps resented his father's fame (the movie hints that it was his desire to become as well-known as Mark that prompted him to cheat) but he's lucky to have had the father he did. Otherwise, master's in astrophysics and doctorate in literature or no, it's unlikely he would have been teaching at Columbia, even as an Instructor. (Talk about unfair advantage!) What is the movie's point of view? It's not completely spelled out, but it seems to be that it was okay for a nobody like Herb Stempel to cheat but not for someone with Charles van Doren's status. There's a certain reasonableness about this judgment. It's one thing for schmucks like you and me to steal towels from a fancy motel like the Tiki Waterbed Palace in Kansas City, but it means something entirely different if a celebrity does it. It's not part of our job descriptions to be models of rectitude, whereas we feel that famous professors and politicians ought to be. It seems an especially apt observation since in the case of quiz shows nobody gets hurt or deprived of anything. It's not a zero sum game. Under different circumstances, though, that's exactly what it is, and that's when cheating becomes not simply unethical but criminal. An armed robber is depriving another of something of value. Yet, our attitudes towards cheating must be very mixed indeed, to judge from the users' comments under 'The Cheaters.' If you cheat in an academic decathlon, you're depriving someone else of something of value, although it isn't a material good, but rather a reward whose value is symbolic. At the end of this story, no one has profited. Stempel, the loudmouth who has been gunning for the blond Aryan, finally brings him down, only to discover that he feels not satisfaction but pity for 'the poor guy.' Goodwin, who was after television, has torpedoed a comrade instead. The public loses its innocence. One or two network small fry are barbecued. And van Doren of course is ruined. The only winner is television itself, which will go on to bigger and better things like 'World's Wildest Police Videos.' Why bother watching someone on TV exercise their brains when you can watch people smash up their cars on a freeway? It's difficult to believe that there was actually a time in our history when people would crowd around their TV sets and watch a contestant struggle to answer a question about the King of Belgium. Maybe Ray Bradbury put it best: 'The television, that insidious beast, that Medusa which freezes a billion people to stone every night, staring fixedly, that Siren which called and sang and promised so much and gave, after all, so little.' Gimme 'Survivor' any day, and pass the sugar frosted flakes.",8,7,10,29 May 2002
The Dark Knight," Action Aplenty.
","I tried to get through this. Really I did. And I could appreciate the effort that went into the performances and the wads of dough that must have been spent on special effects. The atmosphere too is lucidly rendered -- night time in the big city.But my enjoyment was hampered by the fact that I'd outgrown most of this stuff about the time I entered High School, and that was when the comic-book Batman still looked like a human being, not a bemuscled behemoth.The experience, the viewing of this, as much of it as I could stand, was exhausting. You have never seen so many vehicles, large and small, racing through the gloomy and deserted urban streets. And every one of them seems to crash and turn into an exploding fireball emitting shards of glass and flaps of unidentifiable metal.The business is taken seriously too. The blows rained upon the victims seem to hurt. The occasional wisecracks from The Joker don't begin to make up for the realistic pain.It all makes me wonder if our peculiar civilization hasn't entered the decadent period that precedes its fall from dominance. At least in the comic books you had to READ the dialog bubbles. Here, no challenge at all. Just sit back and let the despondency overwhelm you.I know, I know. I missed the point. It's just a fantasy. Right enough, but it's somebody else's fantasy, not mine.",3,18,37,12 April 2010
Everest," Imperfect Storm.
","This is 'based on a true story' of people who climbed, or tried to climb, Mount Everest in 1996. It was difficult enough getting to the peak but on their way back to base camp a storm blew up and four of the team were lost and one lost his hands and nose to frostbite.It's more like a National Geographic Special than a feature film. The locations are magnificent and indifferent. The top peaks are wind whipped and the storm, when it appears, is congested with roiling black clouds and lightning. There have been other movies about mountain climbing but they've never used such effective computer-generated imagery.The personalities -- some of them -- are established well enough without any complicated back stories but individuals are more or less lost during the climb, when everyone is bundled up and masked.And the story is otherwise confusing. The director and, especially, the editor, Mick Audsley, are responsible for making it clear who's who and who's where. The occasional location titles help -- 'Camp Number Two -- 2 PM.' But I gradually lost track of what was happening except to two or three members of the team, and even then I didn't know just where they were. Some of the incidents must have been improvised for dramatic purposes. Doug is panting and exhausted but lets the rest of the team descend while he struggles towards the peak. The leader, Rob, helps him, and the two men finally stand alone, with Doug whooping and planting his fingertip on the point of the highest boulder. Since both men died, the scene is cast in doubt.One of the film's more admirable aspects is its lack of sentiment. There are a few too many minutes of Rob (the sympatico Jason Clarke) moaning his last words over the radio to his wife Jen (the refulgently gorgeous Kiera Knightly) but otherwise the deaths are well handled. Two men slip off a cliff during the storm but there is no Wilhelm scream. There's no exceptional sound at all, just the constant whoosh of wind. Nor does the camera follow the falling body, tumbling over and over. Nope. The two guys slip on the snow and fall out of the frame. Nicely done.Not to be picky but when one of the men (Doug, played by Josh Brolin) finally stumbles back into base camp on his own, all frostbitten and hypothermic and half blind, the first thing they do is take his frozen fingers and dunk them into bowls of steaming water. Eskimo mythology gives us several layers of hell, where the bad folks go, just as our mythology does. The lowest level of Eskimo hell is eternal torment associated with the thawing out of frostbite. There's no indication of pain here, just relief. And I hope that steaming water was merely warm rather than hot.If one wanted to, he or she could read the analog of an organic lifetime into this story. Everyone begins in high spirits, calling each other 'mate' and 'man', all of them exuberant -- 'What a GREAT VIEW.' Then they reach the peak or almost reach it and begin a descent that ends in tragedy for some and distress for the rest.What is it that drives someone to climb Mount Everest anyway? What the hell is the point? Nobody knows. 'Because it's there,' is too flip, and the reasons given by the team members are fatuous. It probably has something to do with self testing, seeing how much we can get away with, whether seeing how fast we can run without collapsing, parking illegally, or outwitting a mountain.",6,0,0,6 September 2016
Into the Wild," In search of time not found.
","I've never seen a movie quite like this one, not an American movie at any rate. The one that comes closest, maybe, is 'Easy Rider,' but that one was full of plot points and ambition, raggedy though they turned out. 'Into the Wild' is more like an assemblage of episodes from a self-made movie, put together with the help of some family friends who happen to be professional actors.Emile Hirsch is the non-fictional Chris McCandless who gives away everything he owns, takes to the road, and winds up owning nothing in the Alaskan wilderness, not even the opportunity to savor the emotional fulfillment of being completely and utterly alone.Hirsch isn't bad either. He is transformed from chubby and cheerful at the start to thin and desperate by the end. I would guess the film sticks pretty closely to its origins, which I think I remember reading in The New Yorker years ago.The narration is based on Chris's sister's memories and on Chris's own journal but narrations can be misleading or sometimes plain wrong. It seems to be all the fault of McCandless's bickering parents. It was they who drove him to these peregrinations. Well -- that's kind of an easy way out. It provides a satisfying explanation for a story that is likely to be otherwise unexplainable, at least until we know more about neurology. It's always easy to find a trigger for behavior in our past experiences. Psychoanalysis rode that horse for generations. In reality I suspect that strangeness in people is partly a given at birth, and the explanations are post hoc and fitted to the cultural climate. It's tough enough being the parent of an odd child without being blamed for every odd thing he does.Where was I? I think I started out for the Sea of Cortez and found myself, like Chris, in the North Woods.The photography is sometimes stunning, often appealing, and sometimes as idiosyncratic as Ray Bolger's dance in 'The Wizard of Oz.' Step motion, slow motion, negative shots, all are employed but not, thank God, to the point of nausea. The whole film is leisurely, moving back and forth from Chris's encounters at home and on the road, to the Magic Bus he lives in at the top of the world.Good actors. Nobody in the movie flubs it. Catherine Keener and William Hurt are exceptional performers but they have little to do on screen. Hurt does get a chance to register some convincing abject anguish at the end. Hal Holbrook, now an older man, has never been quite as good as he is here. A home run for Holbrook.Does the movie have a point? Well, it certainly tries to impose one on the narrative, something along the lines of spiritual fulfillment is worth any price, even life itself. Hirsch dies with an open smile on his face, gazing at opalescent clouds. (If I remember correctly, the real Chris assumed his absence would be noticed and was waiting for an expected helicopter rescue.) The fuzzy points I would take away don't include our need for others in any but a mechanical sense. (We need others to make our shoes and guns.) There have been successful hermits before. I certainly wouldn't conclude from this story that nature is cruel because it isn't. It's just indifferent. What are we, after all, except a widespread large mammal that happens to call itself Homo sapiens?",7,2,4,13 June 2009
Annie Hall," Touching Story of Failed Romance.
","Woody Allen meets Diane Keaton in New York and they fall in love, move in together, try a separation, move back in with one another, and finally split up -- Allen to remain stuck in New York City with his neuroses and tunnel vision of life, Keaton to move to Los Angeles in search of tofu and fresh air.It's arguably Woody Allen's best film. Yes, he's a version of his usual self-centered character, filled with ontological dread, paranoid, frightened. And, yes, Keaton is a naif from Chippewa Falls, self conscious to the point of nail biting, undergoing a course in Sophisticated 101 from Allen. But both characters are explored in enough depth to flesh them out and give them more than one dimension. They're not stereotypes. They don't have just one shtick.Before 'Annie Hall', Allen produced these reckless and relentlessly funny comedies. Afterward, instead of one dyad, as here, the films dealt with so many characters and their multiple misunderstandings that it became hard to keep them straight or, frankly, to care very much about any of them. Allen's mind was still that of a tribal whirling Dervish but instead of flinging out gags he was flinging out puzzles and mazes, most of them not very amusing.'Annie Hall' is a nicely integrated story. It follows Allen and Keaton from their first meeting to their last, and it's filled with comic lines. At a party of extremely wealthy nobodies in Beverly Hills, the camera slowly glides past Jeff Goldblum, looking very concerned and speaking into the phone, saying, 'I forgot my mantra.' (There are lots of recognizable faces among the bit parts.) In fact, as is often the case, Woody endorses his own life style as the worthiest, though he's not blunt about it. It's just that everyone around him seems so dumb, so phony, so suicidally deranged, that he comes closest to representing normality. That's not saying much because he makes fun of himself routinely.Anyway, the result of all this is that we can identify with both of the leads. Woody's position makes sense. Beverly Hills is full of rich, gibbonous morons who are mahogany colored and festooned with jewelry. As Allen remarks, Beverly Hills is so clean because the people don't throw out their garbage, they turn it into entertainment.At the same time, the movie makes clear in sometimes unexpectedly subtile ways (a fleeting expression) that Allen is smothering Keaton. He tells her to take night classes, buys books for her to read, pays for her analysis. And when she grows up enough, she's able to make her own choices despite Allen's objections. If she wants to go to Los Angeles and live in a Day-Glo purple mansion with minarets and garden gnomes, that's her business.The movie ends with a hoar-encrusted but poignant comic observation that neatly encapsulates the atmosphere of the movie itself. We all need the eggs.",8,0,0,11 September 2010
2001: A Space Odyssey," I think, therefore I am. (I think.)
","Nobody could have done it better than Kubrick. The question is, 'What does 'it' mean?' I'll skip the story, what there is of it. Anyone who wants a reasonably decent explanation in coherent terms ought to consult the Film Guide series from Indiana University Press.It is an unforgettable movie that would not have had quite the same impact if it had been made more than one or two years, one way or the other, of 1968.Just take one instance. The computer, Hal, the most interesting character in the film, goes berserk. He signals to the two astronauts that there is a failure that must be fixed from the outside. The astronauts leave the space ship in tiny round pods. While they are gone, Hal kills all the other astronauts who are in hibernation for the long trip to Jupiter. Hal also causes a pod to kill one of the external astronauts and then refuses entry to the remaining live one, Dave (Keir Dullea).Dullea orders repeatedly, 'Open the pod bay doors, Hal.' His expression is one of vexation, as if he's having a duel of wits with a recalcitrant garage door. Finally he blasts his way into the space ship, barely surviving, then sets about destroying Hal. As he climbs a ladder to enter Hal's brain, Hal remarks soothingly, 'Dave -- I can see your really upset about this.' It's EXACTLY what Carl Rogers would have said. Hal begins to sound like a junior executive being fired. 'I know I've made some bad decisions recently. But I can assure you that I am back to normal now. Really, I am devoted to the success of this mission' If that's supposed to be a joke, it must have worked in 1968, when we were all in the business of seeing (or being) humanistic shrinks. I'm not sure that everybody would find the humor in such a line now, in 2005, a year in which most of the USA seems to find itself adrift on Jupiter. In the end, Dullea, if that in fact is what we're looking at, finds himself alone and unborn in the shrill silence of outer space.That 'star gate' episode -- wow! The coeval audience had a heck of a good time seeing it while stoned. Vavoom -- through an unknown universe! Into the Maelstrom. It must have been great if you'd been smoking grass. If you were tripping it might have become one of Edgar Allan Poe's worst hangovers. Just seeing it tonight took me back thirty years or so to when I was a research assistant at the New Jersey Neuropsychiatric Institute, engaged in a study of psychedelic drug use. It was perfectly legitimate, run by the psychiatrist who coined the term 'psychedelic' and visited Aldous Huxley on his death bed, and endorsed by a former Attorney General of the United States. (By the way, has the statute of limitations run out?) We were not supposed to use drugs but one night circumstances demanded it and the next thing I knew I was wandering around a part of Manhattan I was completely unfamiliar with, the East 70s, never having gotten north of 14th Street in my youth. And -- wow -- everything was just terrible. People were walking dogs along the sidewalks and I fancied the dogs were staring at me because they knew I was a complete wreck. Well, let's skip it, except to say that what you need in a paranoid state is not the trip that Kubrick gives you, but a handle on reality. Well, I'm not sure, really. Sometimes I feel spaced out here in New Mexico where the Ice Cream trucks play 'La Cucaracha.' In the New Jersey neighborhood where I grew up they at least had the prescience to play the 'Dies Irae.'Anyway, one of the most impressive features of the film is the special effects -- all done in the 1960s before computers. They are all mechanical or photographic. No computerized graphic images like the dinosaurs in 'Jurassic Park' or the musclebound monsters that leap around on today's screen. If you see a space ship in '2001', it was hand built. The FX are the pinnacle of pre-computerized FX. They're like the clipper ships of the 1850s, marvels of marine engineering, about as good as it gets, before they were replaced by steamships.I realize this is not much of a review of the movie itself, but without having looked, I imagine there must be a hundred or more so, really, why bother? Kubrick was an interesting guy. According to Kirk Douglas's revealing (and not very flattering) autobiography, 'Rag Man's Son,' Kubrick shot 'Spartacus' which had been written by someone on the McCarthy-style blacklist and forbidden to work in the USA. A heated discussion arose about who exactly should get the writing credit, since the actual writer's name couldn't be used. How could justice best be served. Kubrick piped up and said if you want a writer's name, use mine. I'll take the credit. As Douglas put it, 'Kubrick was a talented s***.'But -- all of that period and personal detail aside -- this film is a magnificent artifact. What an artist Kubrik was.",9,5,14,21 June 2005
Men in Black," Pretty Funny.
","This had been around on television for some time and I'd avoided it because it seemed so popular among the crowd that likes to see gore and ooze on the screen, and because I tuned in for a few minutes and caught scene in which the two men in black (Smith and Jones -- two exotic names for you) used ray guns to blow the head off an alien, and then another different head, covered with elastic glue, wriggled into sight. Enough is enough.But I caught the whole film more recently and the humor is generally more subtle than that, although the usual special effects abound. I'll give an example of what I mean. Smith and Jones have just shot down a huge flying saucer that has whirled around the skies like a just-loosed inflated balloon. The saucer crashes into the earth a hundred yard from the two men, and its momentum carries it towards the duo standing there immobile. Closer and closer, it plows through the earth towards the two fixed figure, stirring up a monstrous cloud of roiling dirt and debris. It looks as if they're about to become part of that debris. Jones is starring defiantly at the approaching catastrophe as if staring down a villain in an action movie. Smith says nothing -- no wisecracks, no cries of fright. He simply glances briefly at Jones with an entreating expression. It's only an instant but it's at least as funny as any other scene in the movie.The catastrophic shoot outs and wreckage may appeal to the kids but what I found most admirable were the smaller touches of absurdity. Multiple TV screens of aliens let loose on earth to lead normal lives include clips of Sly Stallone and a popular network weatherman. Two of the aliens, looking normal, or relatively normal, enter a restaurant for a chat. And the director and writer make sure that we see what they order. Not the usual fare, not sandwiches or spaghetti, but pierogi -- Polish dumplings.I won't carry on about it. Will Smith is our proxy. He finds out what's going on as Tommy Lee Jones leads him through the problems they face. Smith is often puzzled, frightened, and given to ironic cracks. Jones is his opposite, the straight man who never smiles, and who is just as funny because his absurd statements are delivered deadpan. Ditto for Rip Torn, who plays it almost as a serious thriller. Linda Fiorentino is alluring as all get out and I'm glad she was there, so she could tumble through the trees in a short skirt.The kids will get a kick out of the wreckage and the grown ups who are sensitive to the more delicate touches will find it funny.",7,7,9,4 January 2015
Pride & Prejudice," The Heart Has Its Reasons.
","A proper English romance among the hills and the dales and the fens and the stately homes. The men bow, the women curtsy. The proprieties are always observed. The roles of class and gender were tautly drawn, and Jane Austen really gets down on the predicament of women. They couldn't DO anything on their own. Austen herself would let no stranger catch her in the act of writing. The only means of advancement was through marriage.That's the topic she deals with here. How are Mr. Bennet's five daughters going to marry well when Bennet's own estate is in debt? Powerful men aren't supposed to be interested in women of lower background. A convoluted conundrum.Yet the distinctions of class between the Bennet girls and the men who are attracted to them, or the other way round, are strictly middle class in nature. We learn nothing about the poor. Dickens would come eighteen years after 'Pride and Prejudice.' It's not difficult to figure out who is going to wind up with whom, at least not where one of the daughters, Keira Knightley, and one of the men of greater social esteem, Matthew MacFadyen, are concerned. We know more or less right off the bat because the two of them don't get along at first, due to a misunderstanding, and they are two handsome people. At least I suppose MacFadyen is handsome. I'm SURE that Keira Knightley is handsome -- or somewhere beyond handsome, in some celestial orbit of beauty where she dwells with the ghosts of actresses like Audrey Hepburn. Yum.I have the same problem with Jane Austen that I have with much of Shakespeare -- not that I'm that familiar with either. But both writers produced all kinds of succulent prose and poetry. The difficulty is that the stories aren't all that good. And she's often confusing. Even her habitations are confusing. One guy in a chat room produced a photo of an ordinary Georgian brick home and claimed it was Jane Austen's house. I argued with him because I'd visited the house of Jane Austen and it was a thatch-roofed English cottage. We finally had to agree that she might have actually lived in two different houses.'Pride and Prejudice' on film is an epic soap opera, and the only thing that can lift it out of the doldrums is Austen's marvelous prose, which we can't read, and her dialog, which at least we can hear. And the performers have to be very good to come up with a successful production -- and that they do.It's really well done. I find it hard to believe that real people spoke the way Austen has them speak, but the actors and actresses do a convincing job of it. Such elegance! All of them are minimally of professional caliber. Judi Dench is a standout. Make up has given her a whirling hair style that looks like some kind of cartoon but is perfect for her arrogant and snobbish character. Kiera Knightley does very well by the role of the confused eligible daughter. She should leave her face to the British Museum. Her left eye slants upward and outward at an alarming angle and her chin is determined. Her features, in combination with her model's neck, lend themselves to a display of either fright and vulnerability or sassiness and even something worse. She'd make a great Catwoman or Supergirl.",7,0,1,6 June 2015
Singin' in the Rain," About as Good as They Come.
","A lot of people seem to gush over this picture -- 'It's my favorite musical,' said one critic, and Kelly replied, 'That's good to know.' Well, it's hard to believe in lists of best or worst things because everything is made up of several dimensions. Some are good and some are bad. Sometimes very bad. Nobody would argue that Hitler was a nice guy but he DID love his dog, Blondi.However, I have to agree that within the limits of the genre this is probably the most satisfying musical I've ever seen. There is not a single musical number that is a dud. Kelly and Donen avoid Kelly's usual repetitive steps and he really stretches out on this one. There is about a one minute sequence in the 'Broadway Rhythm' finale just after Kelly sings 'Gotta Dance' from his knees that is given over to his solo. His dance is full of balletic leaps and jagged edges. It's a moment on unequaled exhilaration. He seems at time suspended by wires.I'll skip over the contributions of Cyd Charrise -- my God, those LEGS, like a more than usually sinewy giraffe -- and Donald O'Connor. You cannot NOT laugh at O'Connor's number, 'Make 'Em Laugh.' Even after several viewings.The most charming (and best-known) number is Kelly's 'Singin' in the Rain,' but it's not the most technically accomplished. I'd give that honor to 'Moses Supposes.' The whole movie is of course as corny as they come, although it probably didn't seem so in 1952 when it was released. There's nothing pretentious about it. Kelly had an unfortunate tendency to step out of his class with films like 'Invitation to the Dance,' and to be involved in musicals with dramatic underpinnings like the overblown 'American in Paris.' The thing about this MGM musical -- and a few others like 'On The Town' and 'The Bandwagon' is that they were funny as hell IN BETWEEN the musical numbers. Nobody could ever criticize Astaire's dancing. He was great, a much better dancer than Kelly in many ways, but his 1930s musicals with Ginger Rogers were appealing mainly because of their musical numbers. Betty Comden and Adolph Green in the 1940s added stories that could stand on their own as a comedies.There's something about singing as opposed to dancing too. Anybody can sing -- however lousily. You can sing. I can sing. My pet canary sings. Not well, but we all can do it. But dancing is a skill of a different order and to do it well we need the attention of Terpsichore. All those steps that seem so effortlessly improvised on screen (the taps are always dubbed in later) must be memorized one by one by the performers. Tap? Okay -- heel or toe? Thirty seconds of unedited dancing on screen represents about 100 hours of memorization and practice. Not to mention that you have to be in as good a physical shape as a running back.'Singin' in the Rain' is a perfect example of how a nearly perfect musical should be made. Okay, Debbie Reynolds isn't much of a dancer and she can't sing well, but so what? The overall impact of the movie is so warm and fuzzy that it doesn't matter. It's like nibbling some kind of tiny and exquisite pastry, not a big deal, but the equal of any experience.",10,5,8,29 July 2005
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," A Cranial Kaleidoscope.
","Jim Carey is a shy man who is more or less accosted by the extraverted Kate Winslet at a beach party. They begin an affair, then split up. Carey visits her at work, behind the counter at Barnes and Noble, but she has no idea who he is.When he learns that she has had her memory of him neurologically erased, he seeks out the clinic that did the number on her and requests the same treatment. If she can forget about him, he can forget about her.So the clinician in charge, Tom Wilkerson, hooks him up to this modernistic looking electronic junk and leaves him in the care of his assistant, Mark Ruffalo, and the receptionist, Kirsten Dunst. Wilkerson goes home to bed, since everything is proceeding normally.Not for long. Although he is unconscious in this metal helmet and electrodes are planted in his scalp, Carey still can think, and after the procedure is underway he changes his mind and doesn't want to forget about Kate Winslet because he still loves her.A conflict ensues within the confines of Carey's skull, causing little glitches to appear. On top of that, Ruffalo is distracted from the monitor by the seductive Dunst, who happens to look very good in her tiny skivvies, and soon the pair are stoned and boogieing around on the very bed on which the tortured Carey is laid out.What follows is an often confusing and disjointed narrative of what's going on inside the head of Jim Carey. There are flashbacks, accelerated motion scenes, total fantasies, and jumbled reconstructions of events from Carey's past. For instance, he wakes up in bed with Winslet, except the bed is isolated on a snowy beach somewhere. The image is imaginative, jarring, and baffling -- all at the same time.Alexander Pope's poem, part of which Dunst quotes to Wilkerson, is apt. It's from 'Eloisa to Abelard', about two tragic 12th-century lovers who were torn apart from each other and sequestered. Abelard was castrated by Eloise's family. The lines express an envy of vestal virgins who were similarly isolated from the world of Ancient Rome, and who forgot the world outside, just as the world forgot about them. Mr. Leland expressed the same sentiment in 'Citizen Kane,' 'I can remember everything. That's my curse, young man. It's the greatest curse that's ever been inflicted on the human race: memory.' I can no longer stand wobbling cameras, instantaneous editing, and other such directorial razzle dazzle, but the tricks here are kept within certain reasonable bounds and the interpolated scenes with Ruffalo and Dunst manage to keep us anchored in the very real present. I didn't get the significance of all of the scenes. I don't know why Carey and Winslet take turns smothering each other with a pillow, both during childhood and during their recent affair. They didn't know each other as children. Maybe it has to do with the unraveling of their relationship -- somehow, each finds the other 'smothering.' There isn't actually much chemistry between the quiet Carey and the whimsical Winslet. The complementarity theory of marriage has been shown not to work. It's a wonder that each put up with the other for as long as they did.I didn't much care for the minced logic of 'Brazil' either, but I still get a kick out of 'Being John Malkovitch,' which this resembles, only without the laughs from the absurd humor. Yet this movie isn't as bad as I'd expected it to be. The romantic element is confounding but at least is aimed at adults.",7,1,2,10 September 2013
Once Upon a Time in America," Corman Writ Large?
","I know this must be a good movie -- more than a collection of point-blank gun shots, close ups of greasy faces, and crude sex jokes -- because everyone tells me so. Therefore, there's something wrong with me because so many of its purported virtues escape me. Is it that I am actually a terrified anxiety neurotic trapped in this body of a robust, tattooed skinhead? Hmm. Nope. It can't be that, because for that I'd need the body of a robust, tattooed skinhead. Let me think.First, this story strikes me as a kind of Kugel gangster story. Sure, the characters all have Jewish names but beneath that we can easily discern the fun-loving, solidary male society of the Italian cowboys on the plains of Spain.Second, this must be the biggest budget Sergio Leone ever handled, and it must have left him tickled pink. He was already into his 50s and this was his biggest chance. It's like a Roger Corman gangster movie, only with money and ambition.Roger Corman never seems to have thought behind the next scene, whereas the length, multi-generational script, and star power of the cast has enable Leone to give this the gloss of nostalgia. Corman wouldn't have bothered. And to a great extent it works too. There is the score of Ennio Morricone to remind us, lest we forget. Not only do we hear Zamphir or somebody on the Peruvian nose flute or shakuhachi or whatever it is, the score even borrows from the Beatles' 'Yesterday.' So, although it has all the earmarks of Leone -- the first 25 minutes have about a dozen words of dialog and they all come in a rush in the last ten -- I guess it has some virtues after all. I'm a sucker for nostalgia and male bonding. I'm a sucker too for the thirteen-year-old Jennifer Connolly waltzing around to 'Amapola' in a mist of magical dust like something out of a fairy tale, criminal, prompting every man to dream of San Quentin. She's serene. She seems secure in her own Alice-in-Wonderland beauty, as if in the thrall of a belief that it will last.It's a lengthy movie and at times slow. The director uses part of that allotment to give us a couple of grown-up scenes. In one, a doomed man holds a casually ominous conversation with his betrayer standing on the opposite sidewalk. A garbage truck grinds along the street between. When it passes the victim is gone.In another, Robert DeNiro learns that the virginal love of his life is about to leave for a career in Hollywood. He rapes her repeatedly in the back seat of a limousine while she kicks and screams until the chauffeur, whom we've never met, brings the car to a screeching halt in the middle of nowhere and opens the back door. DeNiro stumbles out, arranging his clothes, offers the driver a handful of bills and says, 'Take her home.' Wordlessly, the driver goes back to the car, leaving the money in DeNiro's outstretched hand. The scene undoes a little of the damage done by Tuesday Weld and the array of penises. Yes, thinking it over, I'll forgive the adolescent gag of the masked criminals demanding that the sluttish Tuesday Weld identify her rapist by his penis alone. Weld is the whore to Connolly/McGovern's Madonna. This movie has two kinds of women -- whores and Madonnas. The latter you take home to Mamma. The first you adopt as a mistress. You see what I mean? It's a little hard to squeeze past these calcified clichÃ©s.But, okay. Leone has done one thing he deserves credit for. He tries, for the first time in his career that I'm aware of, to illustrate on the screen a genuine sense of loss, loss of friends and of love, of both men and women, not just through the script but Morricone's elegiac score and the judicious use of New York locations, and he comes close enough to get a pass.",6,4,8,31 March 2010
Taken," Pattern Exhaustion.
","I'm about to not recommend this film but I ought to say that I only was able to get through the first forty-five minutes or so. Maybe it perked up and turned into a masterpiece in the last half. I doubt it.I've always enjoyed Liam Neeson's work. He's a big hulking guy with a nose that begins in the middle of his forehead. He always sounds a little self conscious in front of the camera, as though he's reluctant to have his photograph taken. I like that in a guy.He hasn't been on the screen much in recent years and I've wondered why. Now I believe that if this is the sort of garbage he's been offered, I can understand why he's enjoying his leisure time.The genre is action movie. The propellant is the kidnapping of Neeson's daughter and her young friend to be sold into sex slavery. Neeson spends the movie traveling around, making threats and fulfilling them. He's an ex-spy and marshals all his skills to track the kids down in Europe. He bashes heads all over the continent. We've all seen it dozens of times before.Given that it's formulaic, it still needn't be so terribly uninventive and uninteresting. 'Die Hard' was an action movie that had its moments. 'The Bourne Identity' had its action scenes wrapped around a bewitching puzzle -- who am I? 'Taken' has none of that spark. It could have been written by some hack in a drugged stupor. Neeson does his usual best. He's aging but not too old for the part. Famke Janssen is mature too; still beautiful, still rangy, but ready for different parts now.The most interesting feature of the movie was its villains. It's always interesting to see which kind of villain the benumbed minds of Hollywood will choose. For years it was Germans. Then the Cold War came along and it was Russians. There were odd bits of drug cartels here and there ten years ago. Arabs are beginning to show up. There is the occasional hybrid. 'Die Hard' had a German gang, some of whom spoke with Russian accents. 'Crimson Tide' and 'Air Force One' had the Russians -- but splinter groups, not representing the Russian government.'Taken' uses ALBANIANS. Not the first time Albanians have been used, and for good reason. Albania has historically modeled itself on Mao's China. 'Tune in Tomorrow' used Albanians in a parody of villainy, as did 'Wag the Dog.' The Albanians are taken seriously here. Well, why not? Nobody knows where Albania is except the Albanians. It's terra incognita. Vaguely associated with the Balkans -- as in 'Bosnia' -- or the Middle East -- as in 'Iran.' And, what the hell, they don't have any movie theaters in Bosnia anyway so there's nothing to lose.",3,3,12,11 December 2009
Victory," Fussbol with gravitas.
","This kind of football is serious business. Oh, I know it seems silly for a group of Allied prisoners during World War II to sacrifice their chance to escape just so they can go back and whup the pro team of Nazis. A ridiculous fantasy. It's just a game, after all.But there seems to be something about what Americans call soccer that really gets the testosterone flowing. There have been several riots over the last decade or two in soccer stadiums, some with fatalities. And in 1968, shortly after a three-game series between El Salvador and Honduras, we had the so-called soccer war between the two impoverished Central American countries. The armed forces were engaged. A C-47 flew over the enemy's lines, rolling 50 gallon drums and other ammunition out the door, hoping some of it might somehow explode. It would have been comic had not 2,000 people died, 8,000 been wounded, and perhaps 50,000 displaced. John Huston must have made this kind of movie for that kind of audience. It's one of his minor works and we don't get to see the director having any real fun putting it together. It's about a rag tag team of POWs thrown against a Nazi team and passing up their opportunity to escape in order to finish the game. (Guess who wins.) I gather that our team is made up of real-life soccer heroes. Even a provincial American has heard of Pele. Except for Rocky Balboa, who is the world's heavyweight boxing champion. Oh, and Michael Caine, whose paycheck couldn't have been of sufficient magnitude to compensate him for the waste of his natural acting talent in this movie. It's really not much more than a big soccer game climax grafted onto a standard POW escape movie.You ought to hear the Shastakovich-like heroic music when one of the teams wins. I'll bet that gets the old testosterone flowing, but I think I'll stick with those lines of wooden figures that kick a ball bearing back and forth on a table top. That way, if I have a chance to escape from prison, I can just say the hell with it and run away.",5,1,5,19 September 2007
There's Something About Mary," Raunchy and funny.
","There are these three guys out after Mary (Cameron Diaz), or maybe four or five or six, depending on how you count. The most important are, first, Ben Stiller, the shy nobody who has had a crush on her since high school in Providence, Rhode Island. Years later he learns Mary lives in Florida, and Stiller hires a sly and self-promoting private investigator (Matt Dillon) to track her down and bring back a report. Then there is a faux Englishman (Lee Evans) trying to insinuate himself into Mary's life space by posing as a victim of polio or something. Even more devious in his obsession is Stiller's friend Woogie, crippled by a nervous rash. A football player is tossed in at the end, and an older guy who has been cultivating Mary's neighbor in order to get a crack at Mary.It's understandable. When Dillon brings back his intelligence on Diaz, he tells Stiller that she weighs several hundred pounds, is confined to a wheelchair, has had four illegitimate children, and lives in a housing project. But the fact is Cameron Diaz is radiant. She's tall, slender, a little goofy, morally upright, and a doctor to boot.The movie is anything but politically correct or delicate in any way. The writers have dived head first into the energetic gags, which follow one another almost instantly and range from silly (the masturbation scene) to merely reckless. (Dillon learns that Mary finds pearly white teeth sexy so he has his teeth modified, giving him a toothpaste-ad grin and a slight lisp.) I don't know how much I want to get into this because, inasmuch as the movie is a series of jokes, any description of unfolding events or character will give some of the jokes away. Well, let me say at least that I laughed most at the scene in which Matt Dillon has tranquilized Diaz's little dog so that it doesn't reject him on their first meeting. The problem is that the dog ODs and goes into cardiac arrest. With Diaz out of the room momentarily, Dillon is forced to perform CPR on the dog. When that doesn't work he yanks some electrical cords out of a lamp and tries to revive the animal with electric shock. The dog begins to sputter with sparks and his fur catches fire. I'll leave it at that.Comedies about 'romance' generally call for a sobering statement at the end, in which all is explained and the moral spelled out for the viewer. The Farrelly brothers have included such a scene but it's mercifully brief. 'They were only after you because you made them feel good about themselves.' You'll hardly notice the pain.You know how some comedies are toned down, subtle, and require attention to be fully appreciated? This is the opposite.",7,1,2,26 October 2007
The Last Samurai," Generic.
","In 1990 'Dances With Wolves' was released. It was about an officer who fought the Indians on the plains in the 1870s, became disgusted with the war, and joined the Indians, learning their language, their culture, their mystical ways. It garnered all sorts of critical praise and commercial rewards.In 2003 there appeared 'The Last Samurai.' It's about an officer who fought the Indians on the plains in the 1870s, became disgusted with the war, and joined the Japanese fundamentalists, learning their language, their culture, their mystical ways. Maybe it garnered one kudos less but it still made money. Thirteen years is an eternity in the minds of many.But 'Dances With Wolves' isn't the only model for this film. There have been numerous others in which an American or European it swept up in an alien culture and discovers its hidden virtues. The vices are ignored or minimized. In 'Broken Arrow,' it was Jimmy Stewart. In 'A Man Called Horse' it was Richard Harris. In 'Black Rain' and 'The Yakuza,' Michael Douglas and Robert Mitchum, respectively, learned all about honor from the Japanese.There's usually a good-looking woman in the alien culture. The native beauty serves a couple of purposes. (1) She provides a focus for those in the audience looking more for romance than blood; ie., the female audience. (2) A chance for a little nudity and simulated sex for the men. (3) She serves as an index of the white guy's integration into the alien community. (4) She's there to demonstrate that, by falling in love with her, our boy is not a racist.Tom Cruise is hired by the Japanese court to train civilians in the use of guns so they can put down a nativistic rebellion of a group governed by the code of the Samurai. After a clash with the rebels, Cruise is captured and harshly indoctrinated. He proves his worth. All the generic conventions apply.I didn't stick around until the end because another officer in the US Army, about half way through, shows Cruise the new model of the Gatling gun -- two hundred round per minute and it doesn't jam. The rebels are armed only with swords and bows and arrows. I could see some unpleasant scenes in the offing. I quit watching when Cruise made an ominous reference to Thermopylae.Maybe I was wrong and the rebels, whom we've come to respect and admire, didn't get slaughtered. However, that would be going against the generic current. It would take the inner gyroscope of a Samurai to do that and I don't think this movie has the guts.",6,0,2,28 December 2010
The Hurricane," Menace 2 Society.
","This is the story of a world-famous boxer unjustly imprisoned for more than two decades for felony murders he did not commit. His conviction, upheld in a second trial, before he is finally released by a federal court, is practically an operational definition of the term 'railroaded.' Rubin 'Hurricane' Carter would still be in Trenton State Prison, a hell hole if there ever was one, if it hadn't been for the altruistic efforts of three adults and one adolescent member of a Canadian commune, who became amateur sleuths by accident.The film isn't particularly complicated. In fact, it's dumbed down to a point beyond which a lack of comprehension would be attributed to pathology. Almost all the frissons that might have made this more than a simple tale of moral strength and fortitude have been left out or shaped to fit a familiar mold. Dan Hedaya, for instance, is Paterson, New Jersey's Detective Della Pesci, the personification of racist-motivated darkness. The only reason he's in the movie is to snarl, threaten, make foul racist remarks, chivvy Carter, and see to it that he spends as much time in the slams as possible. Now, imagine that the movie gives him edge and adds other dimensions. Imagine, instead of Detective Della Pesci, Inspector Javert of 'Les Miserables,' another police officer who simply cannot give up his persecution and yet is recognizably human rather than another familiar stereotype. It would have been so EASY to give the heavy a family and a dog or at least a social context -- rising black crime in the cities of the 1960s and the panic associated with it. Yet the writers and the director throw away any chance to turn the film into something other than a condemnation of racism and the white people infected by it. As a kid, Hurricane stabs a middle-aged white guy only to save his chum from an oily child molester. Does anyone believe this? Ho hum.Not to diminish the heinous effects of racism (or, more generally, prejudice) in our justice system. It's an imperfect machine, and Carter suffered abominably for every fourteen-year-old black kid who ever decorated a brick wall with graffiti from a can of spray paint. During one of his trials, the prosecution refers to his having been convicted by 'a jury of his peers' and Jewison gives us a long shot of the all-white jury, in case we might otherwise miss the point. We can't help being relieved when Carter is ultimately released, and can't help thinking somewhere in the back of our minds about those twenty years of imprisonment.Nobody really has much to do as far as acting is concerned. Denzel Washington is pretty good at projecting pent-up anger and defiance. And the writers have his character develop too. At first he concentrates on turning his body into an instrument of power. But after reading some inspirational books he develops his mind as well, and in practical ways. He resists being swept up in the prison system by rejecting what sociologists have called 'the small reward system' of total institutions. If favors are returned by cigarettes, Carter doesn't smoke. If submission leads to protection, Carter can do without the protection. His career in the Army, however, was not quite the smooth ride the movie gives us, but let's not dabble in too many discrepancies between art and life.The other characters are rather blank. Life in the Canadian commune was evidently not lastingly satisfying. (Carter and Deborah Kara Unger's blond altruist were married, then divorced.) But we don't really get to know much about them. They -- and Carter's legal defense team -- are played mostly as bland do-gooders who would have failed if not pushed to the wall by the power of Carter's will.There's a good movie around this story, lurking someplace, unorganized, entropic, waiting for someone to write it and put it on the screen. It's a parable of good and evil. Not of good people and evil people, but of people who are each, within themselves, good and evil, just like all the rest of us. But this isn't that movie.",5,7,10,1 November 2007
A Clockwork Orange," Organic Mechanism.
","Poor Anthony Burgess had been clobbered over the head by personal tragedy when he was writing the novel. Still, he did manage to produce a work that was not only serious drama but was punctuated by comic elements in Alex's narration. Kubrick's movie maintains about the same ratio of serious social comment and laughs, or at least smiles.Malcolm McDowell is Alex, a vicious psychopath who rapes, pillages, assaults old men, and finally murders a woman in the course of a robbery. (In the novel, he and his droogs speed down a road running over small squealing animals, but this doesn't appear in the film, presumably because it might drain us of any empathy we might feel for Alex. Killing innocent humans is one thing -- but squashing little animals?) Alex winds up in prison and is subject to 'the Ludovico treatment,' which is a form of conditioning. He's released when he's cured of his violent impulses and fantasies. The problem is that wherever he turns he seems to run into former victims. He's driven to a suicide attempt that finally cures him of his cure.The question posed is whether humans are nothing more than mechanisms whose works are determined by circumstances, or whether they are blessed (or cursed) with free will, as most religions like to believe.Burgess comes down on the side of choice rather than determinism. It's an easy position to take. We're all aware of our own indecisions and anxiety, which we feel as a matter of choice. It's much more difficult to treat consciousness as an epiphenomenon -- a kind of side effect of our underground neural circuits hard at work -- which is what behavioral psychologists believe. It's hard to tell what model Kubrick endorses.Kubrick's movie is funnier than the novel. In the book, most of the humor was ironic and literary. In Alex's prose, the Minister of the Interior becomes 'the minint or something.' But the film gives us additional humor because we see Alex and his droogs and victims from the outside. Patrick Magee, as one of Alex's victims, has been accused of overacting. And he DOES do the quivering madman quite well. But, if we can distance ourselves from the movie's message, his performance becomes amusing because it's outrageously overdone. And, in fact, just about all of the performances are overblown, McDowell's included.It's amusing too because some incidents have been added that are, in themselves, designed explicitly for humor. Having unwittingly drunk some drugged wine with his dinner, Alex confesses to his host that, actually, he feels quite well except for a feeling that something terrible will happen at any moment. With no further prefiguring, his face plops down into the plate of spaghetti.The film is identifiably Kubrick's. He's fond of flat, high-key lighting. And he uses many sets that are acoustically active, so if someone sets a wine glass down on a table top, the 'tink' echoes. A lengthy shot is take from Alex's point of view while he lies supine in a hospital bed. At the bottom of the shot are his two feet, toes up, and an identical shot appears in 'The Shining.' I wish he hadn't decided to transform Beethoven's ninth symphony into some kind of electronic warble. What a travesty.",8,1,4,2 January 2012
Where Eagles Dare," The Guns of Germany.
","The two Allied impostors, Richard ('I've been through hell') Burton, and Ciint ('My Mule Don't Like You Laughin' at Him') Eastwood, have infiltrated a German fortress high atop a craggy mountain, accessible only by cable car. Their mission: discover the identity of a cabal of Nazi spies operating out of London. The two of them, along with three other British agents, are parachuted into the area at night and things, both little and big, begin to go wrong immediately. See 'The Bridge on the River Kwai' for another example. Or -- better yet -- 'The Guns of Navarrone.' Burton is the leader, savvy and quick witted. Clint Eastwood is already a nascent Dirty Harry, the man who kills without passion.I'm trying not to give away too much of the plot because there are several unexpectable twists in it.First, though, the photography and setting are truly impressive. Gloomy, filled with foreboding, snow bound. Second, there can be few less likely American killers seconded to a British mission than Clint Eastwood. A Wehrmacht cap simply does not sit well on him. And his acting was to improve over the years. There is a scene in which Burton and Eastwood are frantically trying to escape from the aerie and find themselves trapped in a radio room with alarm bells clanging all over the place as the German soldiers search for them. Burton is doing all he can to reach his base on the radio. Eastwood is keeping a lookout down the hall. Eastwood looks through the doorway and announces, 'We've got company.' His tone is that of a man who's dinner has been interrupted by the doorbell. And the 'company' is about three dozen machine-pistol wielding avid Nazis -- just about all of whom get slaughtered.In fact there is a lot of slaughtering in this movie -- all of it suffered by the bad guys. I mean, this is one brutal movie when you come right down to it. Nobody hesitates to shoot a fleeing German woman in the back. And there is a terrific fight on top of the tram that is twirling wildly in mid-air. A boot-in-the-face kind of fight. The deaths of most of the victims is not at all bothersome, since most are as faceless as Dirty Harry's victims. But one handsome young soldier is listening to a sentimental tune on the radio while Eastwood creeps up behind him to slit his throat, and the scene raises hairs on the back of your neck. And when a bad guy takes a half-mile nose dive off the tram, his scream is as agonizing as those of the sailors that King Kong shakes off the tree trunk.The movie was probably done as it was to satisfy the audience's thirst for a bloody but victorious Allied enterprise, but it is SO realistically violent that it winds up being insinuating. What if the Allies has lost the war? We would all be sitting around watching German or Japanese agents slaughter an equal number of dim-witted Americans and Brits.However, if your search is for war-time action, this is it. But it's only enjoyable if you keep in mind that it's all a fantasy, like the Rambo movies. Otherwise, you might contract a case of the creeps. Behind the gunsmoke, the movie is a shiver looking for a spine to run up.",6,3,7,26 September 2008
From Hell," The Neverending Story
","I guess we'll continue to get ever more implausible solutions to the mystery of Jack the Ripper. We don't seem to be getting any about Dr. Palmer, but Jack soldiers on. Maybe it's the name -- 'Jack the Ripper,' or his location, 'from hell.' It must also be the sex and the gore. Here's a guy slicing and dicing, and poisoning isn't a patch on butchery. It's probably also because, after all, the crimes were never explained. And the human mind has a tendency to recall uncompleted tasks better than completed ones. (In psychology it's called somewhat grandly, 'the Zeigarnik effect.') Anyway, if we don't know the real answer, then ANY answer can be proffered.This one's fairly routine in its general outline -- something to do with syphilis and marriage beneath one's station among the Royals -- but to tell the truth, I got some of the characters a little mixed up. The hookers, for instance, were hard to tell apart except for Mary Kelly (Graham) with her mane of gloriously curly Irish red hair. The others didn't seem well differentiated, possibly because so much of the movie takes place in the dark.The elaborate set that represents Whitechapel in 1888 was built on the outskirts of Prague. The art direction is quite good, as far as a viewer can tell, but again, the sets might have been half as well done without most people realizing it because the shooting doesn't give us much in the way of grand sweep. There isn't enough fog, either. Or -- let's call a spade a spade -- not enough industrial smoke because that's what it was. I wish the director had taken more care to give us a sense of place. The murder scenes, including the positions of the bodies, are accurately reconstructed, but -- well, take for instance victim number three, I think it was, the one who died in the back yard of a scruffy tenement, positioned next to a fence made of boards. This barren tiny yard was reached through a passageway that ran under a crummy building. Several windows opened onto that back yard. A door led from the tenement to the outhouse at the yard's far end. (I feel I know this place well because it's the stuff my nightmares are made of, and it's always tinted a dull orange for some reason.) But none of this dismal atmosphere is brought on screen. We aren't prompted to wonder why none of the windows were opened by the tenants, or why there were no screams heard, or why on earth the Ripper would entice his victim to stand against a fence that anyone wanting to visit the loo would have to walk past. Part of the popular appeal of Jack the Ripper goes beyond the homicidal maniac and his victims. It includes all of Victorian London as well, especially the East End, its delapidated brick buildings, its toxic air, its blurry streetlights, its rain, its gin-soaked whores, its ordinary pedestrians, its entire physicality, its eidos as well as its ethos. And that's what's missing. Most of the scenes are shot from middle distance, and a lot of the circumstances are lost for this reason. The setting isn't really SCARY enough.As if to compensate for this, there are many cuts to dripping blood, scintillating knife blades, and gurgling cut throats. There are several blazing frames of women screaming. And when a knife is shown you can be sure there is the 'slinkkk' of blade against blade even when there is no other knife in sight. (What a cliché.) Inspector Aberlinne's use of opium and booze gives the director and editor a chance for yet more confusing fuzzy quick shots of events which may or may not have happened, be happening, or will happen. There is quite a bit of blood on screen without the murders being all that graphic. The producers didn't seem to mind the blood but they insisted that the horse manure be cleared from the cobblestone streets so the family audience wouldn't be offended. Note: you can show throats being cut, but you can't show horse s**t.While we're at it, the movie is based on what is now called a 'graphic novel' but which we used to call comic books. (Actually, it was 'funny books' where I grew up.) When 'The Man Who Would Be King' was released thirty years ago, it was accompanied by the release of a 'novelization' of the film -- as if the original story by Kipling were too demanding. I thought that was pretty insulting. Now, with dozens of books in print on Jack the Ripper, we have a movie for adults based on a comic book. The speech balloons are limited to a few words in each panel. Sometimes just one word -- a shriek or imprecation. A generation ago it seemed that a story by Kipling might be too demanding. Now it's prose itself that is endangered. And I can see the logic behind the trend. Why demand more effort of the consumer than he is prepared to offer? Why ask him, for instance, to walk a few blocks to a store when he can harness the three thousand horsepower engine in his SUV and DRIVE back and forth? Why ask him to learn that the expression 'a lot' consists of two words, an indefinite article and a common noun, instead of just one word, 'alot'? This raises a question that is at least as interesting as who committed those murders 120 years ago. The question is, exactly how lacking in curiosity and cognitive stamina can consumers be, and exactly how dumbed down the demands made on those consumers, before a civilization collapses of its own ignorance?Geez, will somebody help me down off this soap box? It's so high my nose is beginning to bleed. Thank you.",Null,6,11,10 June 2004
Groundhog Day," There is a fifth dimension, beyond that known to man....
","This one is a winner in almost all respects, a kind of comic Twilight Zone episode that never quits.  Murray has had roles in which he does nothing funny but seems to stand around waiting for laughs anyway, wearing a goofy expectant smile, as in 'Stripes.'  But not here.  This is probably his best role.  He may still have the goofy expression but this time the laughs arrive on time.The movie excells at three levels.One is the overall conception, the comic theme itself.  Murray, a sarcastic and sadistic weatherman finds himself stuck in a small dreary town in Pennsylvania with two colleagues, one of them Andie MacDowell, his producer. They cover the local Groundhog Day celebration then find themselves unable to leave because of a blizzard.  The next morning Murray wakes up to find that it's the same Groundhog Day all over again.  And the next morning too. And so on ad almost infinitum.  So far so good.  A nice concept but it could go either way, depending on how it's handled.  In fact, it's handled very well.  What could have been a one-gag movie that ran out of steam after the first quarter hour turns instead into a neatly logical progression of plot and character development.  Murray of course is the centerpiece of the tale and it is his changes that occupy our attention; the other roles, although well done, are mostly there to provide reflections on Murray's moral evolution.  (Andie MacDowell, wardrobed in slacks, white blouse and checked vest, and done up with long fluffy curly black hair, looks radiantly appealing.)Murray's reaction discovering that he is now living Day Two is one of a terrible anxiety.  He manages to get this across effectively, even though it is tinged with his own brand of distant amusement.  On Day Three he is depressed and gets drunk.  On Day Four he realizes that tomorrow will have no consequences and tests this hypothesis by breaking all of the rules of traffic.  As the days pass, he plans to seduce MacDowell, and he implements his plan cleverly, discovering more and more about her -- her favorite drink, her favorite toast, the kind of man she is looking for.  He has so much time on his hands that he learns to play the piano expertly because MacDowell likes men who play instruments.  His scheme seems to be working but no matter how perfect his playacting he simply cannot get her into bed in one single day -- and every day he must start over with her from scratch. ('Twelve years of Catholic school speaking,' she tells him.) Eventually, however, he comes to realize that he really DOES care for her because, after all, he's gotten to know her quite well with the passage of time, although she doesn't know it.  When he undergoes this epiphany he goes about doing good, no longer just acting nice but actually BEING nice, whether it advances his desire to get her in the sack or not.  Obliquely, indirectly, it works without his having intended it to.  She falls for him and they live happily ever after.  That's the overall conception and it's very well handled.Level Two is the script, the dialogue, and this too is superior.  How many movies can throw in a handfull of quotes from Sir Walter Scott and people of that ilk -- one quote is in French -- without making a contemporary audience, used to MTV, squirm?  'And winter/ slumbering in the open ground/ wears upon his smiling face/ a dream of spring.'  And it isn't just stuck into the script; it fits into the scene and is an appropriate comment on the plot.  But more than that, the lines are not only intelligent but sometimes very witty.  Just a few examples that come to mind.On Day Two, I believe, Murray is sitting in a bowling alley with two local drunks, bemoaning his fate.  He once spent a beautiful day in the Carribean with a gorgeous girl.  They drank pina coladas.  They watched the sun go down and then they made love like two otters.  Why couldn't he be stuck in THAT day instead of this one?  'How would you feel,' he asks his pals, 'if you woke up every morning and it was the same awful day and nothing you ever did made the slightest difference because nothing meant anything?'  One of the drunks, glumly replies:  'That about sums it up.'On Day Three, Murray and MacDowell are sitting in the Tip Top Cafe and he has a huge tray of fattening food in front of him.  He lights a cigaretteand stuffs whipped-cream pastries into his mouth.  MacDowell:  'I hate to see a man of your advanced years destroying himself.'  Murray:  'Maybe they're not advancing as fast as you think.'Last example from dialogue, somewhere down the time line, after he's begun worming his way into her affections:  Murray and MacDowell are walking along at night in the snow, her arm through his, and she tells him, 'Thank you for a very nice day.  It's the kind of day that could never be planned.' Murray:  'Well -- it CAN be planned but it takes a lot of work.'The third level at which the movie works is, very simply, the actual small bits of business that the actors involve themselves in.  Ramis, the director, plays the doctor who checks out X-rays of Murray's skull to see if there's any pathology.  Ramis stares at the photos and says, 'No clots, no tumors, no aneurysms -- at least as far as I can see,' then he turns around and squints tightly and rapidly three time in a row.  (Who thinks up something like that?)  And Murray takes a girl to a Clint Eastwood movie and does an expert impression of Eastwood, from the Man With No Name costume to the voice.  When he turns his back and speaks, it sounds exactly like Eastwood.  There are running gags about things like innocent-looking but bottomless puddles in the gutter.  I know that some of these things sound old, but they are so well realized here that we can forget their age. They seem born anew, just like Murray.There is one danger in a story like this that the movie skirts neatly. The romance between Murray and MacDowell, had more been made of it, could easily have turned cloying.  That's what happens to Jack London's characters in 'The Sea Wolf.'  You've got to handle this carefully, because, as we all know, comedy in itself is of no significance.  (How many comedies win academy awards?)  The movie has to be about something deeper, of course, and the sort of logic that comes to that conclusions must also come to the conclusion that the audience consists of an unwashed horde of semi-moronic dolts who must have the 'seriousness' pounded into their heads with a sixteen-pound sledge hammer.  The problem is deftly avoided in 'Groundhog Day.'  The romance is funny more often than not.  And during the moments when it isn't played for laughs, it advances our understanding of the changes in Murray's character.  And MacDowell looks angelic enough that Murray's growing feelings for her are believable.  I should also mention the use of appropriate musical numbers on the track.  'The Pennsylvania Polka' is used as punctuation throughout.  Midway through the movie, we get Ray Charles' 'You Don't Know Me,' underlining the uncertainty of the romance. By the end we have an even more romantic theme from Rachmaninoff that begins in sincerity and ends in a jolly jazzed-up version.This is one of the best comedies of the last ten or fifteen years, including 'The In Laws' and 'The Freshman' and 'My Cousin Vinny.'  Before that, there were 'Love at First Bite' and 'Murder by Death.'  Pure comedies, successful ones, come along rarely.",Null,60,103,28 January 2003
Reservoir Dogs," A True Original
","SPOILERS.There's no doubt about Quentin Tarentino's inventiveness. This was a real shocker when I first saw it several years ago. There had been violence before, but never so inexplicable. And gore before, but never gore quite so galore before. And that odd, quirky dialog -- alternately clumsy and adroit. It was obviously done on a small budget but did everything it was supposed to do and more.A second viewing, along with some knowledge of Tarrentino's later work, deprives us of the shock but gives us a better perspective on the movie. A couple of things stand out.One is that Tarrentino is like Howard Hawks in depriving his characters of any background. (That's about all he and Hawks have in common.) There have rarely been such rootless people wandering around on the screen. In this instance, there is a father/son pair, but nobody else has any family, few real friendships except those developed in the course of the narrative. There is no ethnic solidarity. Nobody has a home or a dog. Nobody has a job. Nobody has a girlfriend. These characters are like the ones Shakespeare warned us about, coming out of 'air, thin air.'Another thing is the catholic derivativeness of the story and the scenes. Tarrentino may have made an art movie here but he's gobbled up bits and pieces of every kind of film imaginable, from superior stuff to schlock. The claustrophobic feeling of being cooped up in a warehouse with people you don't know and can't trust, he claims, was borrowed from Carpenter's junk version of 'The Thing.' The moment when everyone is pointing guns at everyone else, waiting for someone to fire first, seems to be from the climactic scene of 'The Wild Bunch.' The exclusive use of pop rock in the score has been done by Scorcese and others. But it's hard to be sure that these are borrowings because, to the extent they are, such borrowings have never seen in such multitudes and so nicely fitted together.The big shootout, of the sort we saw in such detail in 'Heat,' is mostly off screen here, which saves money and doesn't cost the narrative much since it deals mainly with character and motivation and blood. The violence and the blood that follows can be a problem. The focus isn't on suffering, just pain and fear. People bleed enough to fill a bath tub. And that scene in which the bound cop is mutilated by Michael Madsen is a bit too-well set up and executed -- for me, anyway. And this is despite the fact that we don't know the cop, or any of the other characters really. These scenes are just shivers looking for spines to run up. Grown sadists and kids who don't know anxiety may enjoy it more. Interesting anecdote. In an interview, Tarrentino describes how poor Lawrence Tierney was giving his big speech assigning the names of colors to the robbers -- 'Mr. Orange, Mr. Pink', and so on. (Borrowed from 'The Taking of Pelham One Two Three.') Tierney kept forgetting his lines or blowing them and asking to start again from the top. The other actors were required to sit off screen without moving or changing expression. It took two hours for a satisfactory take. All of the other performers who had been sitting like stone idols all that time went suddenly into spasms of twitching, yawning, scratching, and moaning with relief.",7,2,6,30 October 2003
The Great Raid," True to Life.
","This is a very expensive and carefully scripted scenario of a real raid staged by Army Rangers in the Phillipines towards the end of World War II. The raid was designed to liberate a prisoner-of-war camp before the Japanese could kill all the inmates. The raid was successful and the cost not as high as it might have been without the help of the Phillipine resistance.The Japanese occupation of the islands was undeniably brutal. Germans treated their prisoners relatively well, as if they were captured warriors. But for the Japanese, the code covering treatment lay not in the Geneva Accords or, for that matter, in Bushido. The traditional warrior's code usually called Bushido varied a great deal over time. Earlier versions counseled patience and mercy. The Japanese militarists had subverted Bushido and turned it into an ideology in which all conquered people were characterologically inferior. The result was described to me by a friend who had grown up in Ilo-Ilo. 'The river was filled with heads.' The producers shot the film in swampy northern Australia and the city scenes in Shanghai. The period detail is impeccable -- right down to the herringbone pattern of the GI fatigues and the leather (not rubber) soles of their boots. The action scene is believable if confusing. It all rather resembles 'Saving Private Ryan', which is understandable in view of SPR's success: a small elite unit sneaking through enemy territory on an important, life-saving mission. I suppose many other films would qualify too -- 'The Guns of Navarron,' 'The Professionals,' et al.But there are problems with both the writing and the performances. It's not one story but three: (1) the mission led by Benjamin Bratt to rescue the prisoners; (2) the misery of the captives; and (3) the true experiences of a nurse, played by Connie Nielson, living in Manila on a forged passport.The film is too long and seems sluggish. Way too much time is spent on the prisoners, whose abject despondency, if not taken for granted, could have been sketched in more briefly while remaining just as compelling. The nurse's story could have been dispensed with. As it is, a fictional romance is constructed to link her to the prisoners.Joseph Fiemannes must have lost a lot of weight because he looks extremely drawn, but again, too much time is spent with him for no discernible reason except that he's a movie star. At least his malaria is shown for what it is -- a crippling and sometimes lethal disease that involves more than a spasm of shivers.I enjoyed Benjamin Bratt as Detective Ray Curtis on 'Law&Order'. He was just relaxed enough in his role. Unfortunately, the role of commander of this raid requires a character with more power. My God, imagine George C. Scott! Bratt's money scene is when he gives his Rangers a pep talk, and the scene wilts as he recites his lines.Another problem, not an uncommon one, is that few of the other faces are familiar, and in their dark, sweat-stained uniforms and fatigue caps they're hard to tell apart. No particular performance stands out in any way except, perhaps, that of the Japanese major played by Motoki Kobayashi, a handsome and convincing but humorless officer. The director had a hell of a time getting the Japanese to be brutal but finally persuaded them by explaining they were playing soldiers who were 'just following orders.' It may not have worked in Nurenberg but it worked in Australia.",6,1,1,28 March 2015
Total Recall," The Enigma of the Human Mind.
","Well, I must say this is the most vulgar movie Schwarzenegger ever made. The profanity was so astonishing that I had to run the film again and count the number of loathsome words used by the man who was to become the governor of the great state of California. There were thirteen instances of the 'f' word, seven of the 'a' word, eight of the 's' word (including those cases in which the word was incorporated into the expression usually indicated as 'BS'), five 'q' words, four 'x' words, and one case of the 'z' word, for which I am willing to exculpate him because it's a well-known fact that all Viennese are fond of zithers. I suppose a man can't help being what he is.That's certainly true in the example before us. Arnold, with his endearing accent ('Heff a nize day') is what he's been programmed to be by the folks who monopolize the Tympanium mine on Mars ('Mozz') and try to kill all the rebels and turn Arnold's identity so inside out that he doesn't know whether he's coming or going. His mind implants may (or may not) undergo a schizophrenic embolism, which is a neat trick all by itself, but he inserts himself into the rebel group on Mars as a kind of mole for the job creators. He does so with the help of a jive-talking black guy who drives his taxi. At least I think that's what happens. Whenever Arnold came up with his most quizzical look, I was right with him. If anyone can explain why Arnold is disguised as a middle-aged overweight woman at the Mars Airport, and why the get-up suddenly goes awry -- well, I don't know.That's enough of the plot, I think. It's a kaleidoscope of strange images, non sequiturs, and appalling vulgarity. I'll tell you the truth, I was sickened by the odious imprecations. I'm still stunned. And to think this man was my co-star in the magnificent 'Raw Deal.' True, he accidentally knocked me on my dupa during a brawl in a gambling den. I leaped at once to my feet and informed him -- not in an unfriendly manner -- that my hands were registered as lethal weapons in the state of New Jersey.The fact is that the language would have been tolerable, as would the popping out of eyeballs (twice), and the ridiculous menacing earth movers covered on all sides with giant worm gears, if only the movie had had some gratuitous nudity. But, no. Rachel Ticotin is a beautiful woman and doesn't even get to wear a skin-tight suit like Emma Peel.So while away the hour and a half and watch the eyeballs pop.",6,1,5,21 September 2013
Rocky," Mr. Smith Goes to Philadelphia.
","What a nice fairy tale, and most of it due to the writer and star, Sylvester Stallone, aided by director John Avildsen. Stallone is a low-life, well-intentioned young guy who breaks thumbs for the Mafia and makes a few dollars fighting in shabby clubs. He can't even get it on with the homely Talia Shire. Part of the problem is hers in that she's pathologically shy. She lives with her brother, Burt Young, who abuses her, calls her a 'loser'. Finally a drunken Young throws her out. She moves in with Stallone. Two of life's losers, you might say, but otherwise things are at a stalemate.Into this static scene, like the Good Witch of the West, comes the heavyweight champion, Apollo Creed, played by Carl Weathers, who picks Stallone's name out of a hat for his next bout. 'The land of opportunity,' says Weathers, rubbing his hands gleefully over the prospect of pounding the crap out of a white guy in Philadelphia.Now Stallone must get into the ring with this arrogant monster and the odds in Vegas give him no more than three rounds out of fifteen. So he gets up at 4 AM, drinks half a dozen raw eggs, puts on his sweats, and runs and runs and runs, huffing and puffing, through the garbage-strewn streets of dawn. The rough-hewn guy who owns the local gym, Burgess Meredith, adopts him and becomes his manager.The night of the heavyweight championship bout arrives and guess what? Stallone doesn't get knocked out in the third round. Instead, he steps out of his corner in the FIRST round, Weathers taps him politely on the chin, and Stallone slumps to the floor dead. Just kidding.Actually, after fifteen rounds of brutal battle, with Weathers' rib broken and Stallone's face simulating the recovery phase of a major face lift, Weathers has won on points but barely. Stallone has achieved his goal, which was to 'go the distance,' to give it his 'best shot.' On first viewing I thought the ending was perfectly constructed. No thirty-year-old slum bum could train for a couple of weeks and win the championship from a skilled and powerful boxer, no matter how big his heart. But he COULD go the distance. Alas, the ending has Rocky losing the fight, regaining his self esteem, marrying the now rather fetching babe, and winning $150,000 -- but it was all commercially oriented. The fight HAD to end as it did, not for dramatic purposes, but so that the inevitable sequel could follow, and the sequels to the sequels, and so on ad infinitum. It wasn't about self respect or love at all. It was just about money.That ending turned out to be a crashing disappointment but in the context of the first Rocky film it works flawlessly. So does the rest of the script. Stallone is quite good as the inarticulate hoodlum, constantly hunching his shoulders and shadow boxing along the sidewalks. He's like Terry Malloy in 'On the Waterfront'.Don't want to run out of space here, so let me mention a weakness or two. Unlike the Rocky character, it's obvious that Sylvester Stallone doesn't lack much in the way of self esteem. His pheromones are so powerful that he scores with his girl on their first date. He hardly ever passes up a chance to strip off and exhibit his bulky muscles. He climbs out of bed on the first morning of his regimen wearing a grimy sweatshirt that matches his other outfits, and -- you should see this apartment. It looks worse than MINE. Junk all over the place. Two turtles ('Cuff' and 'Link' -- cute, eh?) in their aquarium. Naked light bulbs. But he gives us a glimpse of his skivvies -- blue Gucci Pucci nylon briefs that barely conceal his genitals. Stallone hands us his genitalia all the time, in this and other films. (He starred in a skin flick once, so it is said.) Rocky refuses to 'fool around' with his girl while in training because he has to remain 'strong.' In other words, sperm equals strength, and women drain you of it. What the hell is this -- folk physiology or psychosis? I ask because another Rocky had the same conviction in 'Raging Bull' and because the insane General Jack D. Ripper also believed it in 'Dr. Strangelove.' It must have involved a monstrous effort on Stallone's part to disguise such a phenomenal ego.I thought there was something of a problem with the racism too. Apollo Creed (whose name whisks me back in time to Catechism and memorizing the prayer The Apostle's Creed) is a thorough dufus, given to snapping out orders to underlings, like, 'Make sure you fly my barber to Philadelphia.' When he chooses to fight a white man, the promoter says, 'It's a very American thing to do.' 'No,' says Weathers, 'it's a smart thing.' He's an egotistical fool, and not an endearing one either. Just a fool.Now I've gotten the bad stuff out of the way. The bad stuff would become badder as the series wore on and lead finally to the self glorification of Rocky XXI. But that doesn't detract from the charm of just plain 'Rocky.' It's a fairy tale but an uplifting one, written with insight into the characters, a perceptive performance by Stallone, and expert direction. When Stallone first invites the bashful Shire upstairs to his room, he enters the doorway alone. She's standing at the bottom of the stairs looking up doubtfully. And we see his hand emerge from the flat and hold the door open invitingly. And there's a scene in which Stallone and Meredith must first argue heatedly and then agree to a partnership. The reconciliation is in long shot and we don't hear any dialog. We only see the two finally shake hands, evidence of a director's delicate touch.",8,0,0,14 March 2009
Eyes Wide Shut," Night Life of the Gods.
","One gets the impression that the detractors of this movie outnumber the admirers but I suspect that, if it's true, it's because the movie was directed by THE Stanley Kubrick. It's hard to top a string of hits, some of them near masterpieces. If it had been directed by some nonentity who had just graduated from film school it would have been hailed as a momentous debut.The plot. Doctor Tom Cruise is married to Nicole Kidman and they live on Central Park West in New York. After a party they get stoned and Kidman confesses that on their vacation last year, she noticed a naval officer and couldn't get him out of her mind, not even when she and Cruise were making love and developing plans for their life together. She'd have given up her future to be with this other man just for one night.Now these are ugly words for a husband to hear. He winds up walking the night-time streets, brooding about his wife and doubting his own grasp of things in general. He runs into a pal, a pianist, who quietly tells him that he's going to play the piano blindfolded at a secret party at a mansion. Everyone wears costumes. And he lets slip the password. He leaves, warning Cruise to forget everything he just heard.But Cruise is still tortured by Kidman's confession, rents a costume and mask, and attends the party. He's discovered as persona non grata and, surrounded by a hundred weirdos in dark costumes and garish masks, he's told to take off all his clothes.To make a long story short, he is 'redeemed' -- ie., saved -- by a nude woman and he's allowed to leave. The next day Cruise learns that his pianist friend was hustled out of his hotel with a black eye by a couple of well-spoken hoods. And the woman who apparently volunteered to substitute her life for his is found dead of an overdose. Is it all coincidental? Cruise tells Kidman all about his overnight adventure and the two of them agree to believe that it was simply one of those things.It's slow. Mighty slow. Nobody speaks quickly. There are long pauses between utterances while one of the conversants stands open mouthed with expectation. The plot is wispy and filled with adventitious encounters. In all these respects, and more, it's a lot different from Kubrick's earlier stuff that, by comparison, seemed to rocket along propelled by the plots. But it's an obvious culmination of certain trends in Kubrick's later work, which is to say everything after 'Paths of Glory' -- the episodic structure, the looseness of consequence, the introspection.There are, though, some interesting innovations. Kubrick had developed a habit of high key lighting. Everything was a fluorescent white in his late work, maybe with accents of color here and there, mostly apple red. There's unyielding light everywhere, as in a hospital operating room. In '2001' even the floors were translucent and lighted from below. He's reversed himself here, and it works too. It's Christmas time in New York. The streets are decorated with colored lights and interiors often have Christmas trees. The overall tone of the lighting is rosy and golden and warm all over, an ironic contrast to the disturbing goings on we witness.And there is more comedy that we might expect. There's an encounter with an odd hotel clerk, Alan Cumming, that is right out of the Enchanted Hunters scene in 'Lolita' (both novel and film). And another ludic moment in the shop of a Jewish costumier who discovers his daughter, Leelee Sobieski, in flagrant dilecto with two Japanese transvestites, beats them up and locks them away for the police. When Cruise returns the costume the next day, the two Oriental gentleman emerge with Sobieski from a back room, happy as clams, and it becomes clear that the shop owner is pimping his own daughter.Before I run out of space -- and, believe me, this multi-layered effort deserves plenty of space -- I'll add a few asides. The piano theme that dominates the last half of the film is by a Hungarian madman, well, oddity actually, Ligeti, who built that ominous score almost entirely out of only two notes on the keyboard. It's an astonishing feat. Tom Cruise is something of an embarrassment as an actor, at least for me. I'm sure he's a nice guy and gives it everything he's got but I'm always aware that I'm watching some guy from New Jersey trying desperately to enact a role. It can't be the dialog, as elliptical as it sometimes gets, because Nicole Kidman is saddled with the same kinds of lines and she handles them smoothly. (By the way, she sports an exceedingly nubile figure in her skivvies. She's a lot sexier than the naked hookers at the party.) And it's not surprising that she's married to a doctor and lusts after an officer in the Navy. One projects immense wealth and the other power.",7,1,5,20 March 2009
Some Like It Hot," Snappy and hilarious
","It isn't the first time men were in drag on the screen and certainly not the last, but surely it must be the funniest example.I'll skip the plot and just make a few offhand observations. One is that the writers put a near-perfect polish on this script. They didn't simply throw gags and comic situations into the story hoping they would all add up to a funny movie. Instead they worked running gags into the dialog. Some of them are so utterly without symbolic -- or even sensible -- content that they become in themselves sidesplitting. 'Type O blood.' It must come up half a dozen times in outrageously irrelevant contexts.And one that took me at least ten viewings to catch. I will now spell it out in case anyone out there is as dull as I've been. Near the beginning, when Joe and Jerry are still Joe and Jerry, Joe pitches some woo to Nellie Wymeyer in order to borrow her car, a Hupmobile 1929. An hour into the film, long after this brief exchange has been forgotten, Josephine has cornered Sugar on 'his' yacht and explains to her the origin of his impotence. It's an imaginative and tragic tale. It seems he met his only true love at the Grand Canyon. She was as blind as he was. They stood together on the edge of the highest cliff. He took off his glasses. She took off her glasses. He took a step towards her. She took a step towards him. 'Oh, no!' cries Sugar. 'Yes. Eight hours later they brought her up -- by mule.' That's not the running gag though. The running gag is that while Josephine is improvising this blatantly phony yarn, making it up as he goes along, free associating, he mentions that the girl he loved was named Nellie and that her father was president of Hupmobile. Absolutely nothing more is made of the connection between Nellie Wymeyer's Hupmobile and this baloney Josephine is slicing -- in fact he skips rather blithely over it.I don't think I'll give away any other gags, which means I can't really describe the movie in any detail.But mention should be made of the score and the arrangements of the contemporary tunes, for which I guess Adolph Deutsch is responsible. They're wacky when that's called for and sweet in an old-fashioned way when ballads are required. 'Stairway to the Stars' has never sounded so romantic, and 'I'm Through With Love' more wistful. (Catch the key change after Monroe finishes singing.) The underscore is remarkable too -- a frenetic combination of bass and tenor saxophone. (What else?) Monroe seems a bit thick waisted but it doesn't detract from her sex appeal because she's so Hollywood gorgeous. That transparent dress she almost has on during her love scene with Tony Curtis doesn't dampen her appeal either.The two male leads give unimpeachable performances. I know Tony Curtis has often been criticized for his 'mannerisms' and his accent but they fit his character well enough in the Bing Crosby part, while Jack Lemon couldn't be improved upon in the Bob Hope part of the continually hoodwinked, constantly cackling breathlessly. All the supports are just about right too. Sid Polyakoff -- 'Spielt mit der PhilharMONic!' And where on this planet did casting find all those goons who play George Raft's companions. 'These are my lawyers. All Harvard men.' Those FACES.I can't find anything bad to say about the movie. It's funny from beginning to end. If you haven't seen it yet, you owe it to yourself to catch it when you have a chance.",9,12,20,9 July 2005
Inside Man," Surprising bank heist flick from Spike Lee
","I missed the first 20 minutes or so of this film so that may have contributed to my inability to follow some details of the plot. I get the impression, though, that it was pretty complicated to begin with. And there seems to have been some elisions here and there. (What, exactly, is the significance of the diamond ring?) Basically, a gang of thieves takes over a bank and holds hostages. It is to be 'the perfect bank robbery.' When you hear a phrase like that, used in all seriousness, you must cringe.As it turns out, however, it's not really a robbery at all but rather a scheme to expose the bank's founder and owner for the money-grubbing opportunistic scoundrel he was when he played footsies with the Nazis in order to come into possession of some valuables taken from victims of the genocide. The robbers escape without detection and the lead detective (Denzel Washington) alerts the mayor of New York to the nefarious history of the bank's founder (Christopher Plummer).Lee has more smoothly integrated white folks and African-Americans than in some of his earlier movies. And he has turned the police into good guys for a change. To be sure, when all of the hostages are released and come storming out the bank's front door screaming, 'Don't shoot! Don't shoot!', and the officer-in-charge (Willem DaFoe) shouts 'Stand down!' into his radio, the assembled cops open fire for a minute or two anyway. Firing into the crowd, they MUST be hitting people and yet no one is hurt or killed. I suppose this is related to an earlier suggestion by DaFoe that they use rubber bullets, even though this is never made clear.But then a lot of the story takes unexpected twists and seems jagged, the way life is, rather than the way movies are. 'He won't execute any of the hostages,' Washington announces firmly, 'because he's not the type.' Next scene, we see the principal heavy shoot a hostage in the head. And when offered a promotion as part of a deal to cover up the bank owner's scandalous past, Washington seriously considers it. Everybody else is going to get something out of it and he might as well get his.The performances are uniformly good, as they generally are under Spike Lee's direction. And Lee has an impeccable eye for camera placement and movement. He uses one or two extremely effective overhead shots and is given to angles that turn individuals into masses. Jody Foster, in a relatively small part, gives her most confident performance in years. Clive Owen as the gang leader is a paragon of tranquility throughout, but he has evidently been told to keep his eyes wide open and never blink, a tired cliché.The villain of the piece is Christopher Plummer, head of a bank, filthy rich, and white. And yet even his crimes are mitigated, though not excused. He has insight. 'I sold my soul to the devil,' he says, 'and I've spent my life trying to buy it back.' He's turned philanthropist in his later years and has gone about doing good, as John D. Rockefeller did.In 'Do the Right Thing,' Lee's DP was Ernest R. Dickerson and he did a splendid job except for a few lapses. He seems to have been caught up in current trends and lost sight of his responsibility to the viewer. Most of the movie is shot in darkness with neon-blue highlights. The images are so high in contrast that in the interrogation room they turn almost black and white. He uses a 'Vertigo' zoom twice, without point, and he succumbs in one shot to the loathsome current fad of strapping the camera to the front of the actor, so that the images are jerky and disorienting. The script could have been nothing more than another genre piece, an imitation 'Dog Day Afternoon.' Instead it's a rather different take on a rather old idea.Worth seeing.",7,1,2,9 April 2007
Hoosiers," Hard To Take Seriously.
","It's 1951 and Gene Hackman is an ex basketball coach who has spent the war years and then some in the Navy. He's hired by a small-town high school in rural Indiana to care for their team. The team members are a little self satisfied, having been runners up in some small-time contest a few years ago. Hackman finds the town unfriendly. They liked their last coach and resent him. He brings new ideas to the game -- no more zone defense but rather man-on-man. But he's determined to see these boys whipped into shape and win Big Time.I ask you, the discerning viewer, does he succeed? Barbara Hershey is a teacher hostile to Hackman. Does he win her over? Dennis Hopper is a disgusting drunk but he knows everything about the local teams and how they play basketball. Does Hackman hire him as Assistant Coach? Does Hopper overcome his demons? Is Hackman fired by the town but saved at the last minute by a revelation of some sort? Does he improve the team's spirit. Does he make them want to fight like dogs? Does this get them to the Big Tournament at the state capitol? Does the music on the sound track swell with triumphant fanfares? Are you kidding? I couldn't predict all of the obstacles that would crop up in the screenplay but, once presented with them, pretty much knew exactly how they'd be solved.Maybe part of the reason I found it so tiresome is that I'm not a fan of basketball. But I don't follow baseball either and always enjoy 'The Natural.' And I'm a lousy pool shooter but think 'The Hustler' is a near masterpiece.On the plus side, the cinematography by Fred Murphy is very good indeed, and so is the location shooting. When the distracted Hackman first arrives in Hickory, Indiana, it LOOKS like the beginning of school in September. It's misty, people's breath steams, the ground is littered with tannic leaves. And, as the season progresses, the branches become bare and patches of snow appear in the shadows. If you were driven to find a small farming community dominated by an over-sized white church and an elderly brick high school, you'd want to come here.But how is it possible to take any of this seriously, as the writer and director seem to expect us to? It's a heart-warming write-by-the-numbers story of dispiritedness turning to success. It seems to be aimed at the kind of audience represented by the gangly pituitary cases we watch on the court. The harder you pray, the harder you play.Ho hum.",3,8,25,5 October 2012
Jack Reacher," Mystery Cum Action.
","A man is laid up in a hospital bed, barely conscious, all signs pointing to his having been a sniper who killed four people at random on a Pittsburgh street. He's really stepped into it, though he can't remember any of it. All he can say is, 'Get Jack Reacher.' Jack Reacher is the drifter Tom Cruise, a combination of Sherlock Holmes and Superman.The defense attorney, Rosamund Pike, locates him and hires him as an investigator, her intent being to prove that the accused shooter, Barr, is insane and so spare him the death penalty. Cruise does better than that. He proves that Barr is innocent and uncovers a corporative conspiracy run by the estimable Werner Herzog. Of course there are dozens of tense moments along the way, plenty of action, and numerous deaths.As mysteries go, this one is kind of interesting, although Cruise's intuition sometimes resembles Lieutenant Columbo's in that it leads mistakenly to the correct conclusion. Example: Cruise considers the four victims of the mass murder and discovers that two of them had planned to meet at the spot because they were having an affair. 'So two of the victims weren't there at random.' Well, actually they were. They weren't TOGETHER by accident, but they were at the location by chance. In any case they have nothing to do with the incident.Cruise's character is one of those unconquerable martial arts expert. His opponent barely lay a glove on him while he disables them at light speed or, when he's serious about it, breaks their necks. It was all nicely done by Matt Damon in 'The Bourne Identity.' A car chase at high speed is a requirement for any exciting movie these days. They all represent variations on a theme established in 'Bullit' in 1968. Even the sounds of the full race cams are the same.Cruise is taciturn, impenetrable, without a back story. As the author of the novel on which this story is based, Lee Child, has admitted, the character is an archetype long established in fiction as the mysterious stranger who rides into town and untangles the mess, and then leaves. It was presented superbly in 'Shane' in 1952. I think F. C. S. Northrop calls this the high mimetic mode of narrative. The hero is better than the rest of us but still subject to the laws of nature. Hitchcock preferred to deal in the low mimetic with heros no better than the rest of us, who found themselves swept up in events beyond their control.Bonus points for a director, Christopher McQuarrie, who refuses to surrender to the modern but unstylish tendency to wobble the camera during action scenes. Not a bit of it. The editing is fast but you can tell who's doing what to whom. Which, for some reason, reminds me that there are no sex scenes. Even THAT is a refreshing novelty these days.The director does have a bent though, and it's conspicuous on those few occasions when he uses it. The scene opens with a person speak to someone behind the camera. We don't know who it is. The camera slowly moves around behind the speaker until the other person is revealed. Sometimes it works. 'Hey, that's ROBERT DUVAL behind the counter!' Other times there seems to be no reason for it because the listener isn't a big surprise. The tactic doesn't make the viewer tense, just impatient.As action movies go, this one stands up to the rest of the genre. I was sorry to see Herzog play a heartless heavy because he's such an innovative director himself, and a terribly nice guy in person.",6,0,1,12 March 2016
Titanic," Expensive wreck.
","I've always enjoyed the British version, 'A Night to Remember,' based on Walter Lord's popular book. Yes, it's black and white, and a bit dated, but it's a straightforward telling of an awesome disaster.The 1953 Hollywood version was a boring soap opera which was set aboard the Titanic simply so that some exciting and dramatic scenes could be tacked on at the end.This one is more like the Hollywood version, only with a budget extended to the power of n. What a wreck! In some shots the ship doesn't seem the size of a man-made artifact at all. It seems impossibly huge, twenty leagues long. When the stern rises into the air and a figure falls from the fantail, the figure dwindles down toward the sea which seems a million miles away, and vanishes except for a minuscule white spot marking its splash point. The Titanic in this movie is colossal, stupendous, magnificent, gargantuan, or -- in a word -- titanic.Before the f/x-resplendent climax we endure a romance between a lower-class handsome young man and a pretty, rich young lady. Now, few people realize this, but this is the first cinematic exploration of the theme of True Love overcoming Class Distinctions. Yes, it's true. Love conquers all and you can be sure that threepence or so will be no more than grist for its mill.The film's full of stereotypical character and they're not worth going into. Well, one example -- the wealthy coward who tries to buy his way into a lifeboat. More examples. (There are so many.) Here are the two lovers clinging to the flagstaff as they plung into the see. 'This is where we first met!', she says breathlessly. Earlier the couple find a brand new automobile in the cargo. He leaps into the driver's seat and beeps the ancient horn gaily, as in a Walt Disney movie. She sits elegantly in the coach. 'Where to?' he asks. 'Take me to the stars!,' she chirps. There's a subplot involving a stolen jewel, straight out of Basil Rathbone's Sherlock Holmes movies. Basically this is a megabuck special effects extravaganza built around a B-movie script.So much is lost. Like the irony of the California, sitting a few miles away, watching and misinterpreting the Titanic's distress rockets. The piling up of personal telegrams that kept the radio officer too busy to tend to the ice warnings.The Titanic disaster was an interesting lesson in sociology though, factually speaking. Women and children only, right? Very gentlemanly. Very Edwardian.And most of the women in first class passage were in fact saved. A far lesser proportion of women and kids in second class were saved, and only a handful from third class. You can actually MEASURE the relative impact of social class, gender, and age.I don't want to make this film sound like the catastrophe that the Titanic's first voyage was. If you liked, say, 'Pearl Harbor,' you'll probably like this. It has pretty much the same structure.There's something else that occurred to me while watching this though. When should we just leave the real Titanic alone? Some years ago, Telly Savalas was featured in a TV program called something like, 'Treasures from the Titanic,' in which he displayed and described items retrieved from the wreck and the surrounding sea floor. Savalas gave his best imitation of a carnival barker. You know, smiling, holding up a boot for the camera, pronouncing, 'This was somebody's shoe. Imagine. Someone wearing this shoe as the stately liner made its final descent.' The disarticulated carcass of the Titanic is a giant necropolis, filled with human remains and, who knows?, benthic ghosts. It's a burial ground of sorts. Should we really go searching among the bodies for watches and gold teeth?",5,8,16,20 November 2005
The Happening," Trees Have Feelings Too, You Know.
","I missed the first half hour of this, a production to which my TV Guide gave only one star out of four. That often make me anxious to see it.By the time I tuned it, it was clear that this was one of those extended 'Twilight Zone' episodes with some unseen force following a horde of refugees seeking safe zones somewhere in the Northeastern United States before they suddenly stand stock still, get all paranoid, begin repeating themselves like deranged robots, and finally commit suicide. (One guy lies down and gets himself run over by a mobile wood chopper or some similar device.) The force, whatever it is, seems connected to plant life and is carried by the wind.It's a ridiculous movie. I've seen Mark Wahlberg in other films and thought he was fine, and at least in one case ('The Departed') outstanding. Here, as the central figure, he seems to go out of his way to prove that he can't act. The other performances are okay, and Zooey Deschanel is quite appealing.I was surprised to find it was all written and directed by M. Night Shyamalan, who is a thoughtful and intelligent movie maker. Man, does he make mistakes in judgment here. Enormous close ups of faces are frequent, and a wide-angle lens turns the features into those of a porpoise. It's especially painful when Wahlberg is staring directly into the camera and shouting entreaties to an unseen listener. Otherwise, the photography passes muster. The weeds, the trees, the flowers are all furiously green. It was shot largely in the suburbs of Philadelphia. One scene is supposed to take place in Princeton, New Jersey, an area I'm familiar with, but the placid and empty residential streets we see resemble Princeton as it was fifty years ago. Today it's a bustling industrial park full of glitz and commotion. Anyway, as it develops, plants can communicate with each other and some can even secrete substances that repel others of their species. That's why, when you see a desert with creosote bushes, they're all so evenly spaced that they look as if they were planted. And, if attacked by parasite, some plants secrete a vapor that attracts predators that feed on the parasite. In Polynesia there is a plant called a mile-a-minute vine, and when you touch one of its miniature leaves, they all shrivel up as if afraid they'll be eaten. Oh, they're canny alright, smarter than we give them credit for.Can I quote a stanza from Karl Shapiro's poem, 'A Cut Flower'? Is it permitted? Because it's relevant to the film's message.She tended me and held me by my stalk. Yesterday I was well, and then the gleam, The thing sharper than frost cut me in half. I fainted and was lifted high. I feel Waist-deep in rain. My face is dry and drawn. My beauty leaks into the glass like rain. When first I opened to the sun I thought My colors would be parched. Where are my bees? Must I die now? Is this a part of life?The gleaming thing that's 'sharper than frost' is a pair of scissors. It's the problem that underlies the film and provides it with a message. We're cutting down too many trees and other plants and they're responding defensively. But, don't think of this as unambiguous, or some kind of eco-leftist tract. It's not explained until the end, and then only in a TV interview hosted by a skeptic, and the argument is explained by a professor who looks and acts like a neural shambles. You wouldn't buy a potted African violet from this man, let alone a botanical and moral theory.",5,2,5,9 December 2012
The Untouchables," Professionally Crafted Cop Thriller
","None of the TV channels seem to rerun episodes of the superior 1960s series, 'The Untouchables,' with Robert Stack as Elliot Ness. If they did, no explanation of who the untouchables were would be necessary.They were a small group of hand-picked agents from the Department of the Treasury, supposedly 'untouchable' because they were shrimp pink and incorruptible. Their primary job was to battle Al Capone and, shortly after his being sent up the river, Frank Nitti in Chicago. The whole city was more than ordinarily corrupt during and after prohibition. After all, bootleg booze brought in a lot of money and, as Lord Acton should have said, money corrupts and absolute money corrupts absolutely.Here we have Kevin Costner as the idealistic but naive Elliot Ness who recruits his honest first lieutenant, Sean Connery, whom he finds walking a beat on the Chicago streets. Connery is a crusty old battle horse. His advice to Kostner goes something like this: 'If your enemy brings fists to a fight, you bring a knife. If he brings a knife, you bring a gun. If he brings a gun, you send him to the morgue.' Curiously enough, this particular line has been taken up and used in current arguments about conflicts with nations like Russia, Iran, and North Korea. Seriously. Connery helps Kostner get his act together. They hire an as-yet-untouched recruit from the police academy, Andy Garcia, and the team is sent an appointment from the Treasury Department, Charles Martin Smith, a pipe-smoking begoggled accountant seconded from Book Keeping who finds himself turned into a hero.Al Capone is played in an operatic style by Robert DeNiro, who enacts a tactic for imposing his will that is borrowed from Nicholas Ray's 'Party Girl.' DeNiro is fine. He is apoplectic when Ness confronts him in a hotel lobby and challenges him to a fist fight. The team is triumphant but the happy ending is tempered by the terrible losses. The plot and dialog are effective in capturing a particular, brutal sort of masculine world. The only family we see is Ness's and it's used to pump up the threat quotient. Hardly any friends exist outside the cohesive group itself. There's a recurring refrain -- 'It's good to be married, right?' -- and we must accept that it is because Ness's family dynamics are flawless. None of the other three members of the team seem to have families.With one notable exception, 'Casualties of War,' Brian De Palma's movies irritate me to a greater or lesser extent. Too much Hitchcock. At some point, 'homage' must turn into 'shameless rip off.' Of course the suspenseful techniques work, otherwise Hitchcock wouldn't have become Hitchcock.Yet, it's still distracting when we see a point-of-view shot of an assassin approaching Sean Connery's apartment. The camera peeks through the windows as it follows Connery along the hallway, but when the camera steps on a board and it makes a creaking sound, causing Connery to glance at the window, the camera quickly slides to the side and hides against the brick wall. In a long take, the camera (that is, let me repeat, the killer and the viewer) open a window, glide through, and examine each room in the apartment until it and we and he discover Connery and he turns and aims a shotgun at he, we, and it. Holy Saint Jude -- enough is enough! That long and unprovoked point-of-view sequence would have been disdained by Hitchcock. The sources here are unquestionably the horror and slasher movies of the period, such as 'Friday the Thirteenth.' There is another long, largely slow-motion sequence at Union Station involving a baby carriage bouncing down the stairs. The director's sources are getting classier. This one is no less than Sergei Eisenstein's 'Battleship Potyemkin.'I'm having a little fun at the movie's expense but, as these things go, it's effectively done. A nicely put-together action thriller about a real historical group of tough cops who got the job done. If it's not entirely historically correct, so what? All stories of good and evil are partly fantasies. Relax and enjoy it.",7,1,4,16 April 2009
The Godfather: Part III," Dead End.
","Coppola really didn't want to make this movie but the studio prodded him and provided a lavish budget so he took another stab at it. However, he was now unable to get the cast he wanted. Duvall asked for too much money, so the role of consiglieri was reduced to that of George Hamilton's infrequent appearance as a plain legal adviser. Coppola could now shoot on various locations without fear of being fired but it was no longer The Family he'd been so proud of.I don't really have too much to say about this venture. It's a little sad. Coppola is a sensitive family man. He loves babies. And he blames critics for condemning the movie because he cast his daughter. I don't know whether he's right or not. She looks proper for the part of the virginal Italian girl, not exotic or spectacularly beautiful but innocent. Her performance is hard to judge from one role. She comes across as natural rather than as a seasoned actress. It fits her role but it's hard to tell what her range might be. Diane Keaton was available, probably because not many parts were coming her way, but there is no spark between her and Pacino, just a wan regret without moment.But Coppola is wrong in believing that the movie failed because of Sofia. The movie failed because it was a watered-down and meandering story that seemed without point. The material -- Al Pacino, his family relationships and his intrigues -- is no longer fresh. There is no novelty in it.And sometimes it seems as if the elements that are important to the director are more personal than portentous. He may find it shocking that a newly elected Pope could be assassinated. I doubt that most people care as much as he does, especially since we hardly get to know Raf Vallone. The whole Vatican provides not much more than a backdrop for colorfully robed figures having business meetings and enacting rituals.I'm happy for Coppola that he was able to cast his father as the local band leader in Sicily. And I like Coppola's personality. He's growing wine now in Napa or somewhere. And when I lived in San Francisco he owned a small underground restaurant, Tomasso's, where the customers waiting for a table could tap the wine barrel in the dark, tiny room as often as they liked and get half lit during their wait. The wait was worth while. The clams cuscus were a rarely encountered treat.I wish I could recommend the movie as highly as the restaurant.",5,45,64,28 May 2015
Mystic River," What happened to, 'My mule don't like you laughin' at him'?
","Clint Eastwood is a remarkable guy. As he eases into and through his 70s, he's taken more chances than ever, unlike Howard Hawks and so many other artists, who repeat themselves as they age. He's explored new milieus in each of his later movies -- a Western with no heroes, women's boxing, a disappearing ethnic neighborhood, the tragedy of heroism, the social elite of an alien Southern city, an even more alien world of doomed Japanese warriors. And he's done it all with a relaxed grace on happy sets. Not all are successful but each embodies an ambiguity that's stunning. They're adult movies, made by an adult for adults. Kids aren't going to be cheering the good guys because there are no good guys.This is the one about the kind of ethnic neighborhood in which everyone seems to know everyone else. The kind that's rapidly disappearing, in this case Boston Irish. (The New England accents are just marked enough to fall short of parodies.) Three men have grown up together, their lives interwoven in various, rather complex ways -- Kevin Bacon, Sean Penn, and Tim Robbins. Bacon has grown into a police officer. Penn is a thug who's spent time in the slams. Robbins is a tormented wretch. The story is hung on the peg of a murder. Penn's young daughter is beaten and shot to death. Bacon probes the case. Robbins, by coincidence, has been involved in a murder that has nothing to do with the death of Penn's daughter but which makes him look guilty nonetheless. Penn, a man of violence, becomes convinced of Robbin's culpability and murders him. When the true perps are revealed, Bacon realizes that Penn will never admit to the mistaken killing of their mutual friend Robbins, but Bacon will need to try pinning him for it, so the two men are now at odds with one another.That's the plot. The real story deals with the exploration of character and of how we are shaped by events that happened long ago, events that we may not even remember with any clarity. The pacing is deliberate, the dialog naturalistic, the mistakes human in their nature, and the location shooting is realistic. (No tours of Harvard Yard or the Old North Church -- just working-class neighborhoods.) In addition to the three principals, Eastwood has assembled a fine cast that includes Marcia Gay Hardin, Eli Wallach, and Laura Linney, among others. None of them are glamorized in any way. Closeups reveal Robbin's stubble, Linney's papules, Penn's nevis, and Bacon's blemishes. But none of it comes across as cruel, any more than our looking in the mirror every morning is an act of cruelty.I guess one of the things that's most impressive about Eastwood's articulation of these settings is that none of them was ever his own. As a child of the depression he followed his father around California, mostly working at gas stations. He's reserved and not especially articulate in interviews. His signature (which I saw on the menu of a Chinese restaurant in Monterey) is the drawling set of loops of a high school student more interested in athletics than aesthetics. A very rich man, he voted for H. Ross Perot. He was never a cowboy, never an effete homosexual snob, never a Boston Irish kid, but he manages to make these characters come alive for us. Who would have dreamed that there was an embryonic artist maturing under that shabby poncho?",7,7,9,5 October 2007
Enemy at the Gates," Saving Stalingrad
","The photography reveals a Stalingrad that hardly anyone would want either to conquer or defend. Ominous, gloomy, wrecked, under gray snow-laden clouds, like the city in Kubrik's Full Metal Jacket. Everything is, or looks, gray in one or another tone. In the chemical factory, even a pile of sulfur, than which nothing is yellower, turns into a bright but sickly chlorine green. No wonder Brighton Beach and Elizabeth, New Jersey, are now filled up with Russians; they left home because of the weather.The sounds come down to us from Saving Private Ryan. I don't think war movies will ever be the same. The German MG42s sputter and the bullets clunk and spatter. As in SPR or Band of Brothers the bullets hit iron with serial clanks. It's imitative but there have been improvements too. We can be grateful that we no longer have to listen to every other shot resulting in one of those long wobbling ricochets, PtewEWewEW.... as the bullet whines into the infinite vastness of space. The sound departments used to be so fond of that particular noise that I've heard it when bullets glance off, not only hard surfaces like rocks, but wooden planks, sod, everything but flesh. The musical score is appropriate to the setting, with occasional echoes of Prokoviev. The acting is adequate. The most interesting character -- and they are all kind of interesting -- is not Zaitsev, the nominal hero, but the Commisar, spurned by his beloved who has fallen for the pop idol sniper, and who turns spiteful and destructive before sacrificing himself. The direction too is adequate. Tania has a scene in which she relates the sad story of how her parents were bundled out of town with other prisoners and then executed by the Nazis. As she goes through this monologue, a plaintive sad tune wanders into the sound track (a hint to the audience that this is a sad story). Meanwhile the camera very slowly dollies up from a medium shot to a close up (an even broader hint to the audience that this story is not only sad but important). In a later scene, Zaitsev is told that his lover has been killed and the camera moves in to a close up of a gigantic eyeball in which a tear seems to be forming. I kept wondering how Ozu would have handled this in something like 'Tokyo Story', which was full of sad tales. His camera wouldn't have moved an inch. And I think I believed it the first time a reflection momentarily blinded the sniper in 'The African Queen' but I sure can't swallow this instance, which takes place in a darkened factory. I wish more directors had enough faith in their audiences' ability to recognize tragedy when they see it. You know, when you think about it, there were very few movies made about the conflict between the USSR and Nazi Germany until fairly recently. The post-war political environment in the USA wasn't such as to encourage heroic portraits of the Commies, and yet we couldn't go with the Nazis either for obvious reasons. Nobody making American movies would have known which side they wanted the audience to root for. This one is pretty even handed as far as that goes. It's mostly seen from the Russian's point of view, and, with the exception of Ed Harris's character, they are the only ones we get to know. (There is a very nice scene of Zsaitsev and Tania making furtive frightened love amid a horde of snoring bodies in a shelter; we briefly see her ivory, smooth, generous butt and it's not at all erotic.) Harris is cool, professional, has lost a son on the Eastern front, and is prepared to die. And, man, does Harris have the body language of the European aristocrat down pat. He sits with crossed legs and polished boots, serenely puffing a cigarette, his face placid. But he definitely revolts the audience when he takes a young boy whom he has gotten to like out into the ruins and hangs him as bait. Zaitsev is positively embarrassed by his notoriety in the media. Khrushchev is bullying and brutal, and the Commisar mouths socialist clichés. (We had to give them a kick in the pants somehow, I guess.) As for the sniping, it's the best part of the picture. I mean, it's hard to make movies about people whose main job is to lie there without moving for long periods. But these guys are sharp. They never miss. Every kill is a head shot. And they can cut a telephone line at 155 meters with one bullet. If they were any better they'd be superhuman. And, again, the audio is not embellished during the few shots we see. POP, and that's it. No clichés. It's a rather nicely done movie, kind of an easy one to get into, and, tense if not gripping, it carries a viewer along.War is a funny thing though. I can't think of another business in which you become a hero by killing more human beings than anybody else. The film avoids the whole issue.",7,1,2,17 September 2002
A Beautiful Mind," Not bad
","For generations people on the street have believed that 'genius is linked to insanity' and for generations psychiatrists have denied that there was any connection. John Nash is one of the reasons the belief is popular. He suffered from paranoid schizophrenia. Unlike major mood disorders (depression, mania) it tends not to come and go -- just to come and hang around. It's a devastating disease, affecting as it does the very organ that makes us what we are. And the side effects of treatment are not to be lightly dismissed.John Nash was a very lucky guy. His search for patterns is rather typical, but his finding REAL ones, that is patterns that exist outside his own mind, is unusual. The surprising thing about his case is not that he recovered but that over the years he managed to climb out of the abyss and find a position with which he felt comfortable. Insofar as this is a success story, it's pretty unusual.Ron Howard belongs to a group of relatively young directors -- Penny Marshall, James Brooks, Rob Reiner are some others -- that tend to take on stories that aren't excessively demanding or quirky. There may be troubles, but the endings are uplifting or heartwarming. This is that kind of story. It follows the trajectory we associate with sports biographies. Hero shows early promise, is struck down by demons during his career, overcomes demons and is apotheosized. That's pretty much the case here. Nash's winning the Nobel is kind of like Redford hitting that final game-saving home run in 'The Natural.' Like Einstein, Nash was awarded the prize for work he'd done earlier in his life. Math and physics are tricky fields. If you haven't made it by the time you're thirty, you're out of the game.But if the story isn't especially uncommon some other things about the movie are. The integration of Nash's hallucinations with his 'real' experiences. This is always tough to do on screen. The fantasy figures in 'I Never Promised You a Rose Garden' are both frighteningly unreal and obvious. But here the viewer doesn't find out until the movie is half over that some of the characters he's gotten to know are productions of Nash's mind. And they're warm and comforting too, we can can understand their appeal. Once or twice they are a bit 'overlogical' too. When his wife is trying to leave him, Nash hallucinates a little girl he'd first seen years ago, realizes that she hasn't grown any older, and that she therefore isn't real. Hallucinations don't work in such a reasonable manner. That's the kind of insight that a screenwriter might dream up. The movie also is a bit weak in conveying the kind of deterioration in personal care that accompanies schizophrenia. Most patients aren't pretty. They are suffering and it shows in their bad teeth, their mismatched clothes, and carelessly groomed hair.Still, within these limits, the movie is pretty good, the acting especially. It's easy to gain praise for playing the role of a deviant. You can win awards for it (cf., 'Charlie,' 'Rain Man,' et al.) But for the first time, Russell Crowe does a fine job of suggesting a genuine personality behind that dimly comprehending physical bulk. He actually comes up with a real performance as the young Nash. And it only improves as he gets older. One of the long-term effects of antipsychotic drugs is a set of twitchy movements called tardive dyskinesia. A good example of this is given after his return to Princeton, when he waddles along the campus and some kids mimic him from behind and laugh. (Ron Howard had the good taste not to turn incidents like this into moments of heartbreaking, tearjerking, hankywetting, blubbering, lachrymos pathos. Some directors would have done exactly that.)There is also the case of Jennifer Connoly. (Wow.) She's hardly recognizable as the innocent, open-lipped waif that she was in, say, 'Hot Spot.' She's a full-blown woman now, her face filled out and her jaw somewhat hardened, although she has the same girlish voice. Like Brooke Shields she has changed over the years from an adolescent of Kewpie-doll beauty whom any normal man would want to squeeze and bite into a more mature but still strikingly beautiful creature. It's hard to tell whether she is much of an actress. She hasn't had any truly challenging roles. Her movements are languid. They flow like silk. That could be a limitation.Well, see this movie. You may think you've had it bad, but Nash had it worse. For most of us, alas, there is not much of a Prize at the end.",6,4,9,7 January 2003
The Departed," Pulls you in.
","'The Departed,' a complicated story of two cops undercover on each side of the law, one of them in the pay of head Irish mafioso, Jack Nicholson, has Martin Scorsese's usual dash. It would be hard to mistake the film as having been made by some unimaginative dullard. The camera swoops grandly about, punctuated by the odd overhead shot, the actors perform at their peaks, intrigue informs every act, the violence occurs as necessary and isn't exulted over. Scorcese knows what he's doing.I'm not sure, though, that he's able to get inside this loosely organized bunch of non-Latin thugs, or inside the justice system of Boston. This is a kind of tense story that really belongs in Sidney Lumet territory -- marginalized spies with multiple identities, and lots of frustration. Neither of the spies (Leonardo DiCaprio, the good spy, and Matt Damon, the boyishly charming instrument of Nicholson) manages to show any guilt or ambivalence about their jobs, which leaves the film with a considerable psychological and ethical lacuna. Damon is full of zest and worried about nothing but keeping his gangster boss informed of everything the cops are up to. DeCaprio is a neural shambles but not because he feels queasy about being a spy among people he's come to know. He's just frazzled over the possibility of being outed and killed. Still, everything rolls along so quickly that we hardly miss it. And everything is aided magisterially by the quick-witted dialog. Alec Baldwin, head honcho at the State Troopers asks Damon what happened to a suspected murderer. Damon: 'He got knifed in the hawspital.' Baldwin: 'Yeah, but what I want to know is cui bono? Who benefits?' Damon: 'Cui gives a ****? It's all wrapped up with a bow on it.' Baldwin blesses Damon, making the sign of the cross in the air, says, 'I think you are on your way to becoming a cawp,' and buries his face in a bowl of ice water. We have just witnessed about fifteen seconds of cinematic delight.Any weaknesses are not Scorsese's fault, though. Here he's working from a screenplay written by an Irish-American who's given him what amounts to an unusually mechanical plot, and the story itself is lifted from a Chinese source. So it's already gone through three step-up transducers and it's no surprise that it lacks the emotional grip of Scorsese's best work.It's still successful and it gets a lot of help from the cast. Nicholson is hilariously evil with his goatee and those of his improvisations that have been preserved. (When he shoots a babe in the back of the head, he looks down at her body quizzically and remarks, 'She fell funny.' And, 'When there's a cop in my gang and I don't know who it is, I usually kill 'em all.') Matt Damon does a fine job too, and he has his Boston accent down pat. He's so business-like and full of zest as a sergeant in the State Police that he comes across as the kind of cop we all wish were on the job. I haven't seen that much of Leonardo DiCaprio's movies but of the performances I've seen, this is his best. He's rather rattier looking than in the past and he demonstrates a convincing loss of control. There's a woman, too, who physically links the good and the bad undercover cops, who do not know each other. Vera Farmiga isn't synapse-fusingly gorgeous. The bony structure of her face is askew. She looks like a dozen actresses who might be found laboring in the fields of afternoon romantic dramas or support in modest situation comedies, but there's something still that distinguishes her from so many other women who resemble Jennifer Aniston. She can really act. She's not given the best dialog and her character is a little confusingly written but, boy, she can make a simple movement of her hand into a statement. Also she's built. Imagine Cate Blanchett, more petite and slightly lopsided. Ken Wahlberg, as Sergeant Dignam, may give the best performance of all.I enjoyed it. Maybe not immensely, but enough to have found a good deal of pleasure in it.",7,3,7,26 May 2007
Die Hard," A Genuine Fake.
","About twenty-five years ago it came to light that Elmyr de Hory had been painting fake Rembrandts and Matisses and Monets and whatnot. The fakes were bought by expert collectors and some of them hung in famous galleries. The fakes were so good that they became works of art in themselves, glowing with a technical mastery of the medium, lacking only originality.That's kind of what this movie is like. I don't believe there's an original thought in the whole hour and a half of it, but what is shown on screen is beautifully executed -- direction, script, performances, photography, production design.Everything's derivative. Nothing will surprise you. Even the score is completely ripped off. I mean in its entirety -- Beethoven's Choral Symphony. Nothing could be more obscene than seeing the faces of the murdering thieves light up as the vault door swings open to reveal millions of dollars, while Schiller's Ode to Joy swells up on the score.The whole thing is as shiny and sterile as Nakatomi Plaza, and man that is one repugnant space. Towering blocks of geometrically perfect steel and glass, with three probably real trees in the drivearound, although they would have fit the general tone of the movie if they'd been plastic. The human scale is totally lost. Imagine a supersized Leggo community. Imagine the ants who crawl into those monstrous edifice wrecks every morning, pausing before the entrance, staring up at the steel column disappearing into the clouds, and moaning aloud, 'Oh, my God, not another day of THIS.' Bruce Willis is very good as the New York cop who is the fly in gangleader Alan Rickman's ointment. This is a typical action hero role but Willis brings a comic element to it that, say, Schwarzenegger, Stallone, or Eastwood simply could not. Oh, the others could make wisecracks under stress just as well as Willis, but they couldn't do his hysterically shocked and frightened face when some contretemps comes his way. He looks really scared, his eyeballs practically popping out. Have you ever seen Stallone look scared? No, you haven't. Don't try to kid the kid. Here's how you can tell the difference between the three main heroes of the 1980s action movies. Bruce Willis gets bloody and out of breath. Stallone gets bloody but is never out of breath. Schwarzenegger is never either bloody or breathless. That'll be ten cents.I didn't care too much for Rickman's villain. With that aquiline nose and that mouth full of big white choppers he seemed altogether too slimy. When I first saw this movie, I thought this was the extent of his range. But I was wrong. I've since seen him in half a dozen other varied roles and he has a lot of talent.It's curious to see Hollywood movies flailing about in search of an agreed-upon villain since the collapse of the USSR. I keep wondering whom they'll turn up next. The stock heavies have been Germans (WWII) and Russians (the Cold War). Lately, of course, they've been 'camel jockeys', to use the current pejorative. 'Die Hard' opts for the tried and true -- Germans, one of whom has a Russian accent. (Alexander Gudonov, a failed defected ballet dancer, neat guy, who died of drink at an early age.) The action is very well choreographed. Outstanding is the scene in which the roof explodes just as Willis jumps out of a window with a fire hose tied around his waist. He jerks to a stop when the fire hose runs out, smashes through an office window, and the metal roll that contained the hose falls past the broken window and -- well, and so on.There's action, comedy, romance, and all the rest, done to a turn. If you want to be entertained undemandingly for a while, this should do the job.",6,6,16,14 October 2005
Psycho," Perfectly Normal Norman.
","Hereabouts there be spoilers.I don't usually bother with warnings that some reveals will be revealed because so few films actually HAVE twists in them that are in any way shocking. Many mysteries, possibly most, have surprises waiting at the end but they rarely leave you dumbfounded. 'The Crying Game' is one of the exceptions, however, and 'Psycho' is the mother of them all.There isn't much point in going through the plot again, so I'll just note a few impressions that have lasted over many viewings.One is that there are a couple of usually ignored people in the crew that deserve medals. One is the production designer, who is responsible for the overall look of the picture. His work could hardly be improved upon, from the oppressively bleak landscape surrounding Janet Leigh's car when the CHP officer wakes her up, to the haunted mansion on top of the slight hill, surrounded by gardens of weeds.The other neglected contributor is the set dresser. Of course the director, the punctilious Hitchcock, decides questions of props and camera placement, but -- that soulless and bourgeois real estate office with its potted plants and its large picture of a sere landscape that perches over Janet Leigh's desk; the stuffed birds suggestive of Poe (a raven) or a menacing nocturnal predator (an owl), and the pictures of birds, juxtaposed with pictures of roly poly naked nymphs, some in the act of being violated. In Bloch's novel and in the film, the untitled book that Vera Miles examines in Perkins' little-boy bedroom is filled with pornography but it couldn't be shown on screen.The murder in the shower doesn't need to be described but I've never been able to watch this without a sinking feeling that Janet Leigh really doesn't NEED that shower at this particular point in time and space. Leigh is a fine actress. When she's driving away from Phoenix and the camera is on her face, minuscule expressions come and go across her features, reflecting the conversations she's fantasizing about. There's even a hint of a wry smile when she imagines the outrage of Cassady, the fat and self-satisfied millionaire, when he discovers that Leigh has absconded with the money he flaunted, as in -- 'Take that, you bastard.' There's something aptly birdlike about Janet Leigh too. She's narrow shouldered and long legged, a little stork-like, as well as being just the right age. She has the desperation of a woman facing forty. Of course to a man who's spent the last ten years alone with a corpse, Leigh is an object of Paphian interest. She's old but not too old yet, just as she's a star but not too big a star to torpedo the movie when she is eliminated from it.Two shots stand out from a multitude of originals. (1) When Balsam finds Leigh's fake signature in the motel's register, the camera is looking up at Tony Perkins, who is nibbling some candy. Balsam says, 'Oh, yes. Here she is,' and invites Perkins to examine the fake. The camera doesn't cut away but remains on Perkins' jaw as he leans over the unseen book and we watch his jaw and adam's apple working nervously away. (2) Perkins decides to move Mama from her bedroom to the fruit cellar. The camera follows him very slowly as he climbs the stairs and enters her room, but inside of going through the door, the camera rises about the transom and pivots around, an extraordinary movement, so that when Perkins exits lugging mother in his arms, we are too flabbergasted by what the camera has done to notice any discrepancy between the reality Norman has constructed for us and any reality that most of the rest of us might recognize.(3) Just to be wanton, I'll throw in that shot of Janet Leigh's dead eye. The camera first follows a pale stream of blood down INTO the bathtub drain, then dissolves to Leigh's staring iris, then draws back along the floor while deliberately righting itself from a slight tilt to the proper vertical. (Check out the remake. The camera apes the original shot but practically twirls on its axis.) Two weakness or, let's say, things I wish Hitchcock would have done a little differently. One is that car gurgling and sinking into that accommodating swamp. You only find those swamps in the movies and Louisiana. The second is that experimental scene in which Martin Balsam tumbles backward down a rear-projected staircase. The director was more proud of the mechanical difficulties behind that shot than he had a right to be.You know what occurs to me sometimes, when I'm watching this, or when I'm watching some of the garbage that now fills our screens? I wish that the people writing and directing movies like 'Saw II' would rescreen 'Psycho' so they could get some hint about how to make a truly horrifying movie with practically no blood, no monsters with chain saws and no teen agers screaming and running round in panties. Man, have we lost our grip, or what? And while we're at it let's have no more girls named Jillian or Megan, either. I'm tired of them. Bring back the old days when movies had little blood and girls had sensible names like Mary and Hepzibah. Oh -- and let's get rid of that hand-held electronic junk too. No more iPods or Pseudopods or whatever they are. No Blackberries or Strawberries either. Whatever happened to whitewall tires?",9,3,4,24 January 2011
Rosemary's Baby," Something Wiccan This Way Comes.
","The recently deceased Ira Levin was an estimable writer of commercial entertainments, with enough role distance to be able to make jokes about his own work. Like Stephen King, he larded his pages with references to consumer products and familiar names. In the novel Victoria Gionoffrio looked exactly like Audrey Hepburn, not some fictional actress.Here, Levin has written an almost perfect woman-in-jeopardy film that, had it not had the performers, director, and production values of a feature film, would have fit neatly into the sort of template that leaps out at a view from an LMN movie. 'Where's my BABY?', Rosemary Woodhouse screams towards the end.Rosemary (Mia Farrow) and husband Guy (John Cassavetes), an upwardly mobile young couple in New York, rent an apartment in a building haunted by its violent and mysterious past. Guy is an actor, limited to unimportant roles, until his rival for an important part is suddenly struck blind and Guy gets the part he's been praying for. His turn of fortune may have had something to do with their somewhat odd but unpretentious neighbors, especially the Castavets, Sidney Blackmer and the amusingly dotty Ruth Gordon. In fact, as it develops, his good luck owed everything to them. Cassavetes has achieved his goal by selling his wife as a vehicle for the conception, gestation, and birth of the child of Satan. The pregnancy is really bizarre too, involving magic potions prepared by Gordon, and the conniving of a celebrity Ob-Gyn doc (Ralph Bellamy) who is in on the plot.Mia Farrow gradually twigs to the plan and tries to escape, but her every attempt is blocked. We want things to turn out well for her and her baby, of course, but, as is usual with Roman Polanski, the ending is sad. More than sad, actually. 'The son of Satan is born and will lay waste to the world!' shouts an ecstatic Blackmer. Right. The formula calls for a perceptive young man who is a friend, hopelessly in love with Farrow, to catch on and come to her rescue at the last minute, sort of like Hutch (Maurice Evans), but it doesn't happen here.The movie is about as well done as these horror fantasies get. All of the principle actors are splendid. And nobody could have embodied the threatened mother-to-be better than the waif-like Mia Farrow. She's skinny and beautiful to begin with. But as her pregnancy progresses and she suffers severe and continuous pain, and after she has a prison haircut, and after she loses still more weight, she becomes positively hebemorphic and afflicted with raccoon eyes. The fetus may be flourishing but she looks as if she's about to waste away to nothing. She wobbles as she walks, looking barely able to hold herself upright.Polanski's direction is impeccable and so is the production design. And we have to mention the wardrobe department too. No one with more hideous outfits than Ruth Gordon's has been on the screen for a generation before and after the release of this movie. I guess there is one weak scene. In desperation, Farrow visits her original obstetrician (Charles Grodin) and tells him about her entrapment. But, in a scene that we remember from dozens of similar movies, she tries to spill the beans to the attentive Grodin all at once, and the information comes out stumbling all over itself, pile upon pile of non sequiturs and paranoid-sounding arguments. She doesn't sound trapped. She sounds nuts.Anyway, a good job by all concerned",7,1,4,29 November 2007
Zero Dark Thirty," Killing Him Hardly.
","Above average semi-documentary, semi-fictionalized, story of the CIA's hunt for Osama bin Laden. Jessica Chastain, the principal figure, is the young agent who plunges heedlessly ahead in the search, despite criticism from her superiors who, by this time, ten years after the 9/11 attacks, are willing to let him fade into the mists of antiquity -- probably dead or holed up alone in Torah Borah. PS: The CIA, via the Navy Seals, gets him along with arm loads of documents and hard drives.Jessica Chastain is pale, pink, pretty, and distinguished by a long, sloping, leptorhhine schnozz with a little outward bump on the tip. She looks so frail and fair that one might be afraid to pick her up, worried that one of her long bones might snap.We have to assume that the story sticks reasonably close to historical fact although, as usual, some of the dialog and incidents are certainly fictional. I didn't know CIA agents cursed so much. I never realized that women CIA agents curse as foully as the men. I doubt that her colleagues in suits referred to her as 'the girl.'I don't know exactly how an audience is expected to respond to some of the elements. Chastain's fierce determination in the face of so much male hostility sounds a little feminist. The torture and waterboarding didn't work in the scenes I watched, contrary to the claims of some of the politicians who still think it was a splendid and fruitful idea. The president (in 2011) is referred to as 'a thoughtful and deliberate guy,' and I can imagine whole sectors of social space erupting in outrage at the use of descriptors usually defined as 'good' applied to a man whom some Americans think of as innately evil. Kathryn Bigelow, the director, has a kind of mixed record. 'Blue Steel' was hilarious trash but executed with éclat. Her talent seems to have matured. 'The Hurt Locker' had its dimmer moments but was still distinctive, and so is 'Zero Dark Thirty.' I missed the first twenty minutes or so and was more or less confused throughout. The climactic raid on bin Laden's hideout in Pakistan is shot sometimes in darkness as profound as the nastiness it conceals.No mention of such legal and ethical junk as flying a bunch of armed men into the city of a friendly sovereign nation and wiping out a couple of families before zipping back across the border. The history books are written -- and the movies made -- by the winners. No movies yet about the disastrous attempt in the 1970s to rescue the hostages in Teheran or a similar failed helicopter attack on a North Vietnamese prison camp.Chastain and most of the others are locked into their roles but there are some subtle moments. As the raid is being considered, Chastain is grinning as a dozen Seals are playing grabass nearby. She receives the call that the raid is on for that night, and then turns back to the gamboling men and stares open-mouthed at them, realizing for the first time that she may be the principal agent in their deaths.Nice job.",7,1,3,22 July 2014
War of the Worlds," Is Newark Worth Saving?
","A few questions. Compared to the original 'War of the Worlds,' would you guess the monsters in this modern remake are (1) smaller than the originals, (2) about the same size, or (3) bigger? How about this? In the original we never got to see more of the monsters than a single drooping dying spidery hand. Would you guess that in this modern remake you see (1) less of the monsters, (2) about the same amount, or (3) a lot more of the Martians and man are they ugly as sin.Okay, okay. Just one more. A simple true or false questions. The machines not only crash wildly into buildings at the climax but they open a metal maw and disject some disgusting gloppy orange mucous when they give up the ghost. True or False.There are a couple of other differences not worth going on about. This version sticks closer to H. G. Wells' original (although, to be sure, not very close) in retaining the tripods instead of turning them into flying saucers. And this version has less in the way of initial puzzles about the spacecraft and all that bunkum and a lot more emphasis on destruction and special effects. And instead of a girl friend the hero is given a wide-eyed young girl who is already a scream queen. Dakota Fanning is a splendid natural actress too, except for her many screams, which sound like an irritating doorbell.Both version keep the ending from the book, about how God put those little creatures on earth to save humans from aliens from outer space. It ends with a paean to humankind which ought to have been rethought, our chief enemies at the moment, after all, not being aliens from outer space but Homo sapiens that look a hell of a lot like us, if a bit more rabid.This version is better directed that George Pal's too. Nobody knows how to grip an audience better than Steven Spielberg. The acting is an improvement too. I've never seen CGI's put to better use. And Spielberg has managed to capture the seedy residential setting of industrial New Jersey more evocatively than anyone else -- the gray-shingled housing, the wintry weather with the temperature somewhere between thirty-five and forty degrees Farenheit, the stubbly back yard enclosed by hurricane fences, the working-class neighborliness. Not bad, overall, but predictable in it colossal stupendiferous dimensionality.",6,2,4,21 May 2006
All Quiet on the Western Front," Still Packs a Wallop.
","Surprisingly powerful after almost eighty years, this is a true 'anti-war movie.' 'Anti-war' is an adjectival phrase flung around too easily these days. Any recent movie with an excess of gore can be called anti-war, but if you leave the theater glowing with pride at the sacrifice and heroism of our own boys and girls, anxious for the next opportunity to display those old-fashioned virtues, you're not talking 'anti-war.' This one, like a few others, leaves you feeling that you've witnessed not a brave last stand but a moral tragedy as well as a material disaster. Few movies make that cut. 'Das Boot' and 'Go Tell the Spartans' come to mind. They're not necessarily great movies, but they're definitely anti-war.'All Quiet on the Western Front' (the title is ironic) tells the story of a handful of school boys who leap at the opportunity to join the army at the beginning of World War I and kill the enemy. By the end they are disillusioned and dead. We know they have lost hope not only because they tell us so but because the director (Lewis Milestone) and the writer show us a few of the details by which ideals are lost.The dialog and some of the acting are pretty corny by today's standards, and the general outlines of the story, a kind of Bildungsfilm, are overly familiar by now. But it must have been quite shocking on its release because, as a matter of fact, it's STILL shocking. Much of its success is due to the special effects. The incoming artillery shells seem to whistle this way and that, up and down the scale, before exploding in what looks like lethal bouquets of crumbled soil. The mortar rounds don't even whistle. There's only a quick, silly ZOOP, a small pop of dirt, and a man is dead, a stylized fatality.Lewis Milestone has been criticized for being too obvious but I don't know why. He puts his camera on a dolly and runs it at speed across a line of charging men, watching them fall in irregular groups, and it's a powerful and original technique. And the scene in which Lew Ayres tries to talk to the dying French soldier he's just bayoneted is clumsy and ill acted but still wrenching. Particularly effective is Milestone's set-up after the Frenchman has died. The corpse is propped up in a sitting position, a slight, strangely peaceful smile on its face, and Ayres must spend the night next to this horrifying apparition.Lew Ayres turns in the performance of a novice. He was to become a conscientious objector in World War II and it damaged his career, although, as a medic, he performed under combat conditions like any other soldier. Louis Wolheim is Kat, the wised-up veteran with a face like the rear end of the huge, dirty truck you get stuck behind on the Sunday night Long Island Expressway. I think I'll let it go at that. It's an iconic film and not one you're likely to forget in a hurry.",8,6,8,19 September 2007
12 Years a Slave," Unspeakable Abuse.
","Solomon Northrup is a freeman with a wife and children, living in Saratoga, New York, in the years before the Civil War. He makes his living as a fiddler, and when he's invited to join a troupe for a gig in Washington, he agrees. In Washington, he's drugged by his partners, given a false identity, and sold down the river into slavery in Louisiana. After twelve years, he finds his way home.I hate to say this but I found the movie lush but repellent. I can't imagine -- well, maybe I can -- that there are viewers who don't know what slavery in the South was like.In addition, despite its being based on Northrup's memoirs, I thought the scenes of punishment, though well done, were overemphasized and sometimes unconvincing. For instance, the two men who take Northrup from Saratoga to Washington. They have dinner in an elegant Washington hotel, after which Northrup vomits in an alley and is put to bed by his companions, where he sleeps soundly until he wakes up manacled in a dungeon. I can believe his companions got Northrup drunk and sold him out, but drugged? It's a common movie device. The original 'Mickey Finn', chloral hydrate, wasn't used as a hypnotic until 1869. Before that, there was nothing that could knock Northrup out. I wish the movie had been honest and simply shown him having a good time in the big city and overcelebrating.That initial suspicion runs through the entire movie. Some of the events are eminently believable, others not. I can certainly believe the brutal beatings, rapes, destruction of families, and lynchings. But the director's camera lingers on them, far too long, long after we understand the import of the scene. You've seen lashes dealt out before, aboard sailing ships and on plantations, but you have never seen so many, nor have they lasted so long. It begins to seem as if the film intends not only to depict the brutality but to revel in it. It starts to look a little like a member of the emerging genre of torture porn.I realize that criticizing a film like this isn't exactly politically correct, and yet we've seen it before, even if less lavishly displayed. It's been thirty years or more since 'Roots.' Except that here, the director has thrown in some sex -- full frontal female nudity, masturbation in the midst of misery -- just in case you find yourself bored with the atrocities. I have a similar problem with movies about the Nazi genocide. The subjects carry so much in the way of moral outrage that a simple-minded, commercial approach cheapens the tragedy.The photography and wardrobe are just fine. The dialog is stilted, like 'True Grit' with no wit. Apparently the antebellum South never heard of contractions like 'don't' or 'won't'. 'Slavery is an evil that should not be permitted.' That's the way people wrote, in Spencerian script, not the way they spoke. The N word is used without restraint, but I give that a pass because it's evidently historically accurate.I gave it an hour before I was too disgusted to go on. Yet, I think it's a valuable movie for the one in five Americans who can't name the country we achieved our independence from, according to a 2011 poll taken on the Fourth of July. Maybe they really DON'T know.",3,4,10,6 September 2014
Wedding Crashers," True Love, So Elusive.
","Doesn't sound too promising, does it? Two aging adolescents -- Vincent Vaughan and Owen Wilson -- plan to crash lots of wedding in order to score.They'll introduce themselves as distant family members with adventurous but tragic pasts. They'll invent tales of their achievements. They'll wear Purple Hearts to the events. And it works. They stuff themselves on cake, oysters, and champagne and the beautiful girls are all over them. They dance to a hora at Jewish weddings. At Irish weddings, they present themselves this way, 'My name is Sean O'Ryan and I want to get drunk.'Then the inevitable happens. They crash the wedding party attended by the Secretary of State. (John McCain and James Carville do a cameo.) The Secretary is Christopher Walken and he has two gorgeous young daughters. Vaughan falls for the maniacal nympho, who is half his height and given to S/M. Wilson falls for the sensible Rachel McAdams, although she is already engaged to a snooty ex-preppy. It all works out. That's why this can be called a romantic comedy.Actually, the first half of the movie is pretty funny. Yes, the whole shtick is out of one of those raunchy teen-aged comedies, but these guys are funny.Vincent Vaughan is a tall, beefy loudmouth who seems to have trouble with comedy, although he's got some good lines. He's great as a cheerful villain, as he was in 'Clay Pigeons,' but light-heartedness almost defeats him and there's a speed bump whenever he has a scene.Owen Wilson, on the other hand, is good at light comedy. It's hard to imagine his doing anything else. When I first saw him on screen I didn't like him because he resembled Robert Redford, whom I loathe for being more handsome than I, but Wilson grows on you. You get to find that uneven nose endearing. It wanders down the center of his face, an archipelago of flesh.Christopher Walken is immediately funny. He can't help it. Even in dramatic parts, those wondering eyes, that curious gargle of a New York voice, conjure up the conviction that he thinks being in a movie is absurd, that EVERYTHING is absurd. Maybe he OD'd on Sartre in his youth. He'd be funny as King Lear.The guru behind this wedding-crashing business is Will Ferrell. I wish he were funny because he tries so hard, but maybe that's the problem, in addition to his chthonic visage. By the end, he's given up crashing weddings and now crashes funerals. He's not as funny as the doddering old mother he sponges off, the tiny lady who suddenly belows, 'Chazz! It's a friend of yours! Get the f*** down here -- and put away your skateboard!' The 'girls' are as good as the boys. Better even, because both Rachel McAdams and Isla Fisher are pretty girls. Fisher, as Walken's younger daughter, whacks off Vaughan under the table at the family dinner and leaves him tied up at night so that the family's creepy homosexual son can have a go at him. There is a rich hint of lunacy in her squint.Rachel McAdams is revoltingly cute. She could have been drawn by a cartoonist. Every singular feature is in its rightful place and her bottom wriggles deliciously when she walks.I got a kick out of it until it bogged down in its second half, when it got a little maudlin about true love being the awareness of one soul of a corresponding resonance in another soul or some such nonsense. Still, some of the lines show that a bit of thought went into them. 'He's so dumb he thinks Moby Dick is a venereal disease.'",7,0,0,24 March 2015
There Will Be Blood," Well executed, highly original tale of oil.
","Daniel Day-Lewis is Daniel Plainview, an outwardly normal man who sees oil drilling, the exploitation of land and people, and the accumulation of riches as a moral calling. He's as Calvinistically devoted to his work as the zealous preacher of the Third Evangelical Church, whom and which he hates passionately. The story begins with Lewis working alone, chipping away at the bottom of a pit, and ends with him bashing someone's brains out in the bowling alley of his Citizen-Kane-like mansion.The whole movie is weird, something along the lines of Terence Malick, without the narration. The musical score, for instance, by Jonnny Greenwood is not what any sane viewer would expect. Except for a dash of Brahm's violin concerto in celebration of the drilling of the first well in New Boston, it skitters all over the place, full of dissonant strings and, during an action sequence, out-of-synch percussion exclusively.The loopy story covers 30 years in the early development of the petroleum industry and Lewis is one of the first Seneca oil salesmen. He cheats churches out of money he promised them. He adopts an orphaned boy because having a sweet child along might help him in swindling people out of their oil-rich land for 'quail prices, not for oil prices.' In his dealings with others, he sounds polite and practical but inside that shell of practiced convention, there isn't much except anger, loneliness, and a twisted connection to the child that isn't his.The movie hangs almost entirely on the performance of Daniel Day-Lewis -- and does he deliver! Wow. He comes from the British tradition of technical actors who don't delve into their own emotions for a role. That well will turn up dry. Instead they adopt the tics, mannerisms, and voice of the characters they are playing. In Lewis's case it's always interesting to see what he'll come up with next. What a villainous New Yorker he was in 'Gangs of New York.' His character here is originally from Wisconsin, but his voice doesn't sound particularly Midwestern. Instead, if you can imagine this, it sounds like a cross between John Huston and Sean Connery, with intimations of Jack Palance.He outdoes himself in the climactic bowling alley scene. He's waked up by his nemesis from the Evangelical Church, a pasty faced, youthful demagogue from the pulpit who casts out devils -- his own brand of snake oil. (The novel was written by Upton Sinclair, a faded writer who may now be more relevant than ever.) Anyway, Lewis has fallen asleep drunk, in the middle of a bowling alley, a half-eaten plate of food beside him, snoring away on the hardwood floor. It takes forever to rouse him, and it's a mistake to do so. He climbs unsteadily to his feet, shaking his leg that has fallen asleep, still half drunk, and after tormenting his would-be savior, hobbles around clumsily after him, throwing bowling balls and ninepins at him, until he finally flattens and brains him. (Not his first murder.) When the butler appears and inquires, 'Mister Plainview?', Lewis is sitting on the floor, legs akimbo, and shouts, 'I'm FINISHED.' It has the resonance of, 'Mother of Mercy, is this the end of Rico?' Oh, the movie is slow here and there. And some of the ambiguity is perhaps too ambiguous without intending to be so. But the film as a whole overcomes its own weaknesses with a more-than-able assist from Lewis. Watch him in the scene in the primitive church, when he confesses what a sinner he is and must beg to be washed in the blood of the lamb (in order to have access to another tract of land). The preacher hectors him with accusations of having abandoned his child, something Lewis earlier threatened to cut someone's throat for, and Lewis is bursting with rage and humiliation -- sputtering, 'Oh, Lord, I have SINNED! Let me get out of here!' It's a rare film. It's aimed at adults rather than teens impatient to see heads wrenched off. It's aimed at people capable of patience and curiosity about others. There are two murders but not a drop of blood is seen -- and no phony sex. No sex at all. Plainview doesn't want to be loved. He wants to be feared.",8,1,5,11 June 2008
To Kill a Mockingbird," Good Movie About a Decent Guy.
","Gregory Peck is Atticus Finch, a Southern lawyer who defends a black man (Brock Peters) unjustly accused of rape. (It was almost the other way round.) Peck does his best but Peters is convicted anyway by the all-white jury; this is 1932. In Macon. That's in Georgia. While being transported elsewhere 'for his safety,' Peters tries to escape and is shot dead. The redneck father responsible for all this mishigas (James Anderson, who must be great pals with Bill McKinney because their parts are interchangeable) holds a grudge against Peck for defending Peters in the first place, and for proving Peters was innocent in the second place, and for thereby impugning the honor of the Anderson family in the third place. Anderson calls Peck 'a n***** lover' and spits in his face, but of course Peck would find any response infra dig. Anyway, Anderson sneaks up on Peck's two kids on Halloween night and tries to knife them, but is prevented from doing so -- and is killed -- by Boo Radley (Robert Duvall in a powerful but wordless performance). Peck is told by the Sheriff (the ever-emotive Frank Overton) that, although Duvall may have killed Anderson, well -- Anderson was responsible after all for the death of the innocent Brock Peters. 'I say let the dead bury the dead, Mr. Finch.' The story is told from the point of view of Peck's two kids, the eleven-year-old Jem (Philip Alford) and the six-year-old girl, Scout (Mary Badham). It's kind of sweet too, to see these goings on -- both comic and dramatic -- through the eyes of a naive girl like Scout. Kind of like Candide in Georgia. And if Alford gives a pedestrian performance as Jem, Mary Badham does a splendid job with the character of Scout. Credit, too, the direction by Robert Mulligan and the editing by Aaron Stell, who catches Badham's face at precisely the critical moments. (When her brother is in jeopardy and a sudden gun shot is heard off screen, her face jerks and her eyes open wide in an almost perfect take.) It's especially fine work because neither Alford nor Badham are particularly adorable kids. Jem is rather ordinary in a Tom-Sawyerish way. But Badham has a strange face, with keen, slitted eyes, freckles, and a nose that juts out at odd angles. Neither of them is pretty in the usual child-like way, although compared to their friend Dill (John Megna), purportedly based on Truman Capote, they could both be in beauty contests.Mulligan's direction could hardly be better, given the nature of the story. After lights out in this sleepy Southern household, we hear Badham asking Alford about their mother, who died some years ago. The Mulligan's camera drifts from the delicate lace of the window curtains to Peck sitting alone on the porch swing, his face lowered, his arm draped across the back of the wooden swing, as if he can still feel his wife's presence within the circle of that arm. End of scene. Had more been made of it, it would have been banal.The moral calculus of the film puzzles me a little. I'm not sure that 'the dead' who have 'buried the dead' are in quite the same position. An innocent man is shot and killed 'while trying to escape.' A guilty man is killed while trying to murder two children. I don't know. Does that come out right for you? And Harper Lee, and the screenwriter Horton Foote, are pretty easy on the quiet town of Macon. That lynch mob that shows up at the jail to string Brock Peters up, for instance. They are momentarily stopped by the unflappable and imperious Peck, but what really turns them aside is the appearance of Peck's kids. They don't know what's going on. And Badham cheerfully greets the members of the mob whom she knows. She asks them to say 'hey' to their kids, who go to the same school as she does. This innocence is so disarming that the leader of the mob says, 'Let's break it up and go home.' Really? On the flip side of the coin, if the writers treat the town's peccadilloes a little gently, at least there are no Big Speeches -- no preaching. Peck never gives a speech (not even in his summation) about all men being created equal, and God made all of us, and we'd better get our stuff together if we ever expect to have a team like the Atlanta Braves.It's a good, sensitive movie. It may or may not sound like it in precis. (Almost all movie kids are repugnant, I'll grant you that.) But it's quite well done, and Gregory Peck as Atticus Finch has become part of our cultural data base.",7,0,3,10 March 2008
The Bridge on the River Kwai," Among the Best.
","This may be the best war movie -- if that's what it is -- that was ever put together. I don't think it would be made today. It was expensive and there were no women in it to speak of, and any committee member with an MBA reading the script would wonder why there wasn't more action. Further, the movie hasn't got any magnificent computerized graphics going for it. And we hardly see any blood. And nobody's head gets blown apart. And there's not a foul word in it.David Lean has pulled off a neat stunt, making a superb film with a good script, great performances, effective location shooting, a subtext that provokes thought, a marvelously believable set of characterizations -- and no gimmicks.It begins traditionally enough, with red mud and brilliant green foliage, and an authentic prisoner of war camp into which Nicholson's captured battalion marches proudly. The first real hint we get of the film's originality is when the men are marching in place to Colonel Bogey's march and we get one or two shots of feet stomping up and down on the wet gravel. One pair of feet wears only half shoes. The toes are pointing out of the right shoe. On the left shoe, the upper has separated from the sole, and it flaps up and down as the foot inside it drives into the earth. Not only is the shot THERE but it's lingered over, just long enough.William Holden is running through the bushes, trying to escape from the camp, disturbing flocks of bird that chirp madly at him. One of his Japanese pursuers shoots him and he tumbles into a turbulent river. In any Hollywood movie, the drop would be done by a stunt man in the usual manner -- head over heels, arms flailing, off the cliff. Not here. Holden falls feet first, hands and palms held out at his sides, as if expecting to land on a trampoline. He simply doesn't FALL like a professional.The film is loaded with grace notes like this. It's difficult to imagine a director willing to take the time to fine tune his film like this today because both the people making films and the viewers themselves are impatient to get on with the story and reach the next scene that has sex, blood, or comedy in it. I wonder if it's coincidental that people now categorize themselves as fans of one or another basketball team instead of a baseball team. Watching a baseball game calls for patience while the batter digs his cleated shoes into the dirt around the plate. Basketball is all momentum and no patience is required.I won't go on about the movie except to say that it's masterly in almost every respect. But I guess I will mention one more thing of the sort that impressed me, dealing with characterization. Throughout the movie, we've been told and shown that Nicholson cares for nothing so much as the bridge itself. He began by thinking of it as a way to keep up the men's morale and a reason for keeping discipline, but it has come to have functional autonomy, eclipsing everything else in importance. Note the way Guiness's eyes light up in the day-for-night scene when he's told that similar bridges built of English elms have lasted for three hundred years. 'Three hundred years!', he marvels.Likewise, the supporting character of Joyce, on the commandos, is shown as being uncertain of whether he could use his knife in hand to hand combat or not. When an armed Japanese soldier appears at arm's length, Joyce freezes and Jack Hawkins dashes in to kill the man. These two traits -- Nicholson's obsession with the bridge and Joyce's inability to use a knife -- are set up so that the final (and only) confrontation between Nicholson and Joyce can take place the way it does. Nicholson screams, 'Blow up the BRIDGE?', grabs Joyce's legs and pulls him down to the sand, preventing Joyce from reaching the detonator. Commandoes be damned, nobody is going to destroy his bridge. Hawkins and Holden shout from the opposite bank of the river, urging Joyce to 'kill him!' But Joyce can't kill him without using a knife, which we know he will be unable to do.It's a perfect payoff for what we've learned about the two men.Did Nicholson deliberately throw himself on the detonator as he was dying or did he fall on it by accident? Who cares. If he did it deliberately it would be a heroic act since he finally 'came to his senses.' But an accident would be more in keeping with the ironic tone of the rest of the film. At the end, everyone and everything of importance is dead except Clipton the humanitarian doctor who tells us unnecessarily that this is 'madness' -- and those floating vultures with their Olympian view of these goings-on.It's a gripping movie from beginning to end, a magnificent job by everyone involved.",9,18,31,2 September 2004
Man on Fire," Rescue From Mexican Kidnappers.
","This begins as an interesting, if not particularly original, story of character development -- the increasing bond between disillusioned body guard Denzel Washington and the artless innocence and open warmth of little Dakota Fanning as the daughter of a very wealthy couple in Mexico City.I said it was unoriginal because, after the opening scenes, the viewer begins to anticipate the plot. The depressed Washington rejects Fanning's offer of friendship. He tries to shoot himself but fails. Fanning will be kidnapped. There will be some rough detective work in the neighborhoods outside the Pink Zone. Washington will be instrumental in the rescue of Fanning. He will no longer be disillusioned. Justice and happiness and blue skies.But then it begins to look more interesting because it appears that after the kidnapping and the pay off go awry, Washington is shot almost mortally and Fanning is apparently killed by the kidnappers.After that it goes completely off the rails. Under Dakota Fanning's guidance, Washington seems to have recovered his self confidence and his religious beliefs. He reads the Bible and fondles the St. Jude medal she's given him. But this is all narrative froth, because Washington's character then descends into torture porn. Informed that Fanning is no longer with us, Washington is asked what he's going to do now. 'I'm going to do what I do best -- kill 'em.' And he does. He cuts off fingers one at a time, shoots off an entire hand, plugs unarmed people through the feet, shoves a bomb up their rear ends and lets them explode, blows them apart with an RPG. This is religion? Whatever is left of the story is effectively ruined by directorial and editing excess. The director was Tony Scott and the editor was Christian Wagner. They do to the images what Washington does to his bound captives. There are lighting-fast cuts, negative shots, zooms, yo-yoing, slow motion, step motion, and fast motion in which people walk around like Charlie Chaplin. It's not just that the overuse of these techniques is distracting. They interfere with our ability to understand what's going on -- who's where, what time it is, elementary things like that.Denzel Washington is okay, not much more than that. He doesn't have a great deal of range as an actor, though he's likable enough. Christopher Walken in a minor part excels, as usual, and Dakota Fanning gives what is probably the best performance in the film. She's 'cute,' but not the kind of 'cute' that will enable her to sail through adolescence. She's not sexy like Jody Foster and not sublimely gorgeous like the young Brooke Shields. She's an exceptional actress however. Every line sounds believable.I don't know about anyone else but all this busyness on the screen leaves me disaffected. I don't know how long that fad is going to last but I suspect that, sooner or later, a generation will watch these old movies and be as irritated as I am. I really don't need constant flashes of lightning in front of me, as if the whole movie were a thirty-second television commercial, because I am more than ten years old.",5,6,11,8 April 2012
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," On Being Sane In Insane Places.
","If you enjoyed 'Cool Hand Luke' you'll enjoy this for similar reasons. A rogue is thrown into a total institution with a gaggle of passive inmates, organizes them and gains their admiration and allegiance, goes too far, and is defeated by the agents of social control.In both films the story is gripping, exuberant, painful, and allegorical. The psychiatric hospital of 1963 is no more the enemy here than the Southern prison camp. It's the social system with its demands that is the target, and the figure who rebels against the rules is its Prometheus.In both films, too, you'll find sterling performances in the lead roles and among the supporting players. It's one of Jack Nicholson's best, and the director, Milos Forman, isn't afraid to use the editor in order to make the most of it.One of the supporting actors, Louise Fletcher, won an Academy Award for her performance, and she deserved it, just as George Kennedy deserved his for 'Cool Hand Luke.' Fletcher's features and demeanor are perfectly suited to the role of Nurse Ratched, the personification of the social system. Her face seems made of half-melted wax, changing subtlety from fake-pleasant to honest resentment at Nicholson's leaching away of her power over the inmates.There's a knowingness in her anger, as if, underneath the robotic ministrations, there's an extremely perceptive apparatus at work. She reminds me of a stern arithmetic teacher, specifically Miss Velma Spurge, a knotty spinster, of Hillside High School, may her soul be barbecued for eternity.I don't think I'll get into the plot. It's full of surprises. So was the author of the work, Ken Kesey, who was a kind of link between the Beatniks of the late 50s and the hippies that came later and drew their inspiration from acid and a general taste for the colorful and the sensational. Kesey was a genuine innovator. His novel, on which this film is based, is written from the point of view of the Indian chief. Kesey was also the focal point of Tom Wolf's book, 'The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test,' one of the rare instances in which Wolf finds something to admire about noncomformists.See it.",8,1,3,6 March 2016
Edge of Tomorrow," Deja Vu.
","This is one of those movies where you either have to pay careful attention to the plot or forget about the details and allow yourself to be swept up in the extravagant CGis. The viewer gets the feeling that some higher-echelon personnel at the studio watched 'Groundhog Day' again and thought it was, well, just a colossal movie except for three things: (1) No CGIs, (2) No action, and (3) Too full of 'character arc.' So we have a futuristic movie about a deskbound Marine Corps officer (Cruise) who is ordered to take part in an maximum effort attack on the Mimics who have invaded earth and must be destroyed on a battlefield with the resonant name of Verdun. Don't worry about the Mimics. They don't mimic anybody. They're just lightning-fast CGIs that look like overgrown woolly viruses. They're all managed by a central time-controlling apparatus called Omega. Verdun, okay. It's deliberate. But I take it as a coincidence that the thing controlling time carries the name of a famous wrist watch.Eons ago, the movie critics were disappointed in a film called 'Something Wicked This Way Comes' because they were promised computer-generated images and all they got were a few seconds of a choo-choo train plowing through the night. Even by 1975, in the first remake of 'King Kong,' there was muttering in critical circles that the giant ape was supposed to be a CGI and instead he was almost always a man in a gorilla suit -- a very well done gorilla suit, but still a gorilla suit.I get a feeling that the time may have come to reconsider the value of CGIs. They do miraculous things for a movie when they're judiciously used. But now they're becoming excuses to build a movie around.This isn't a bad movie as far as that goes. Tom Cruise remains a lightweight but not irritating presence. Emily Blunt, wearing little make up and with her hair, now blond, tied back is hardly recognizable. She always looks serious too. When she tries to smile, one almost hears the creaking of long-unused facial muscles. The temporals groan in agony. However, I like Emily Blunt a lot. She has asymmetrical features, and anyway someone who looks as serious as often as she does can't possibly be that serious.But, man, is the imagery tiresome. Does everybody in the future have to wear those bulky suits made of metal and plastic with weapons built into the forearms and tiny iPods stuck all over the outside? People are whipped around by blows and blast at such a speed that inertia would tear their heads off. And they can fall the height of the Sears Tower and land alive with no more than a plop. Really.It has moments designed to be amusing. Death is taken very lightly. Cruise doesn't simply fall asleep to start the day over again, like Bill Murray in 'Groundhog Day.' He has to be killed. His colleague Blunt knows this. So every time they get into hot water she takes out her automatic and dispassionately shoots him in the head. Over hundreds of new days, Cruise is both frightened and bored by being shot in the head by a friend.It's kind of enjoyable in its own dumb way. Bill Murray had a goal in 'Groundhog Day' -- to romance Andy MacDowell, and he finally succeeds. Cruise and Blunt have a goal too -- putting Omega out of business, and they succeed too. Best performance: Brendan Gleeson as the shabbiest Marine Corps general in creation, now and forever, and the most subtle actor in the cast.",6,14,29,31 October 2015
Downfall," Unforgettable
","I tuned in late to this film, not expected very much, because we have all I suppose seen so many documentaries of Hitler's last days in the bunker, and a reconstruction with Alec Guiness thrown in for good measure. Many of these presentations depend on interviews with Trudl Junge, Hitler's secretary at the time. Her descriptions of the goings on during the final days are cool, precise, and dispassionate. First Hitler said this, then Eva Braun said that, and then they went up into the garden. A human surveillance camera who seems to have no personal mechanism for judgments.She was, however, quite human after all. The last shot of the film is from an interview with her before her death in 2002. She explains to us that, young as she was, she had always put aside any feeling of guilt for her involvement in the Third Reich, negligible as it was. But then, one day, she passed a monument to Sophie Scholl who sacrificed herself in the course of resisting Naziism, and Frau Junge tells the camera -- and the rest of the world -- that she realized at that moment that youth and naiveté could no longer serve as her excuse.I missed the first half hour or so, but I stayed for the rest. This is an extremely powerful movie. The events in the bunker are keenly observed. There is virtually nothing in the way of sentiment or dramatic displays. If the director, Hirschbiegel, wants two officers to commit suicide he may have them walk into a room and close the door behind them, then allow us to hear two shots a bit later.No one talks about despair. Instead, the officers and some of the ladies sit around a table in one of the bunker's rooms and get drunk as skunks.This is a tragic ending to an insane war, and it is all enacted by human beings, not demons. Goebbels and his wife have 5 beautiful young children, a boy and four girls. They deliberately give them knockout drops, then Frau Goebbels puts a capsule of fast-acting poison in each of their mouths, one after another, and crunches the capsule by pressing each child's teeth together. Then, wordlessly, Goebbels and his wife walk up into the open where, still wordlessly, he shoots her and then himself -- off camera. The soldiers who have been waiting impatiently for this ritual to end, then scurry forward with cans of gasoline to dispose of the bodies.The episode is impossible to watch without being moved. What have Goebbels and his wife died for? What did their children, who knew nothing of war or racism, die for? And, implicitly, the film asks, what did some 50 million people die for between 1939 and 1945? I am grateful to the director and the actors for keeping things so matter of fact. Preparations for a predictable death are pretty gruesome even with the most tasteful intentions, and too often executions and suicides seem to have the filmmakers' attention lavished on them for not much reason other than to pander to a morbid interest in watching someone else die, a kind of arousal jag.How easy it would have been for a trashy sensibility to give us the death of Hitler's German shepherd, Blondi, in all its horror. A DOG yet! Those of us who might have cheered at Hitler's death would now have a chance to weep over Blondi's. Instead, except for a few instructive inserts, Blondi's poisoning is only glimpsed in a clumsy shot through an open doorway.Congratulations to everyone involved in this production. They've given us a well-executed film, made for adults. They come along so rarely.",8,11,14,28 March 2006
Downfall," Docudrama, A Good One.
","Not just another 'See Hitler Get It' movie, with Alec Guiness or someone with a little mustache going mad. I stumbled into this and couldn't leave, gripped by the fine acting and credibility of events.It's a sad movie. Hitler and his Myrmidons may have reaped what they sowed but it's still depressing to see an entire social structure fall apart. And then there is poor dumb Eva Braun, and the half dozen beautiful children of Mister and Mrs. Goebbels, who didnt know the meaning of the word 'war', poisoned and murderered by their own mother. And that's only to mention the unwitting passing of Hitler's dog Blondi. It's a long story but it had to be. The climax is not Hitler's suicide in the bunker but the harrowing escape of his secretary, Trudl Junge, through the Russian blockade to safety.",8,1,3,27 March 2018
Whiplash," Drum Boogie.
","Damien Chazelle directed this story of a talented young drummer (Miles Teller) at an elite music school in New York who is browbeaten mercilessly by his instructor (Dr. Emil Skoda, I mean J. K. Simmons). As unpromising as the material sounds, and as autobiographical, it's better than I'd expected.In the third act, Hamlet has this to say: 'So again good night. I must be cruel only to be kind. Thus bad begins and worse remains behind.'It applies, not just here but in all training camp films, whether it's the Marine Corps, the Army, the Coast Guard, Navy Flight School, or Harvard Law School. It answers the question: What torture did you go through in order to be successful. It's not often we see a drummer boy put through the wringer. And, man, does Simmons put Teller through the wringer, one organ at a time. Teller practices until he bleeds over the snare drum. And THAT'S not good enough.The typical arc of a story like this has the resentful tyro becoming more mature, tempered like steel, proud and manly, winding up with both the admiration of his mentor and the pretty girl he's been diddling on the side. Sometimes the mentor must die, as John Wayne did in 'Sands of Iwo Jima.' Not here, though. It's the Big Night, the finale, at Carnegie Hall or the Hippodrome or La Scale or someplace. Teller proves his worth -- MORE than proves it -- and Simmons finally gives him the okay, a big French kiss on the lips. No, no, just kidding. Simmons only smiles at Teller after the drummer's stunning performance.One of the best things about the movie is Teller's relationship with his girl, the earnest and sweet Melissa Benoist, a student at Fordham. They get along quite well, but then Teller calls it off because in his pursuit of perfection there is no room in his life for a woman's demands. What an ass. Yet it's an original touch, because when he's achieved success (or given up) he calls her to renew the relationship but she has to check with her boyfriend. Teller's default position is 'put upon.' He looks doubtful, sad, mournful even, without a real ability to project anger -- and the script gives him plenty of opportunity. J. K. Simmons makes the picture. He seems to have taken lessons from R. Lee Ermey in 'Full Metal Jacket.' He's abrasive throughout, foul mouthed and in your face. Nothing you do satisfied him. 'That's not my tempo!' After he's booted out of Julliard or whatever it's called here, he bumps into Teller and explains why he was so nasty. He claims he was always looking for the next Charlie Parker, a legendary alto saxophonist, somebody who could absorb insults and humiliation and keep on charging ahead, just like Bird did when he started out. You can be pushed beyond your limits and become a genius or you can settle for having done satisfactory work, says Simmons over drinks. 'The worst words in the world are 'Good job.'' The climax proves him right.Yet, what a dumb perspective, a hubristic paean to Narcissus. As the proverb says, the perfect is the enemy of the good enough. How much should be sacrificed in the search for perfection? Charlie Parker died of drink and drugs at an early age, and for every Charlie Parker there are one hundred thousand guys who are good enough at their jobs.The music we hear isn't classical or pop. Otherwise we'd constantly be hearing 'O, Fortuna' (Ka-boom). Since drums are the featured instrument it must be jazz. And the jazz isn't really inspired either, I hate to say. It's certainly fast and LOUD enough but it's as if every member of the school band were aiming for Maynard Ferguson's excess. I don't claim to know much about music. I'm less familiar with diminished sevenths than I am with diminished fifths, but I know what I like.",6,1,2,11 July 2016
The Wolf of Wall Street," Take Ludes Before Watching.
","Margot Robbie plays the Brooklyn-bred wife of Wall Street scoundrel Leonard DeCaprio. Margot Robbie is also the picture of pulchritudinous perfection. Wow. How is it that Australia, a continent-sized desert island, keeps fielding these toothsome beauties? Cate Blanchett, Rose Byrne, Diane Cilento, Toni Colette, Judy Davis, Isla Fisher, Nicole Kidman, Radha Mitchell, Olivia Newton-John, Greta Scacchi, Mia Wasikowska, Naomi Watts, Peta Wilson, and the ever-popular Mae Busch. What is it, something in the water? Something to do with dream time? There are some things man was never meant to know.As the real life bastard, Jordan Belfort, DeCaprio gives an exceptionally good performance. Belfort has one outstanding talent that, like musical genius, will never show up on a standard intelligence test. He's a charismatic salesman. He can sell you anything. He's smooth and energetic, and he does a lot of dope to keep him that way.His entire life is based on a single premise, stated thus by Mr. Micawber in 'David Copperfield.' 'Annual income twenty pounds, annual expenditure nineteen pounds nineteen and six, result happiness. Annual income twenty pounds, annual expenditure twenty pounds nought and six, result misery.' Money in his world seems to buy happiness, just as it seems to in real life. Would he have any hope of marrying someone who looked like Margot Robbie if he'd been a poor but honest gas station attendant? In your dreams. When he loses his dough and has to sell the house, she leaves him abruptly, dispassionately, rationally, pragmatically. DeCaprio is broke? Good-bye, DeCaprio.The acting is very good on everyone's part. The structure is familiar enough from Martin Scorcese's earlier work that it's comfortably reassuring. We kind of know what's coming. DeCaprio will make a lot of money doing illegal stuff, then lose it, and wind up maybe not much wiser but at least still breathing after he rats on his friends.The acting and the story are nearly flawless, yet the movie doesn't entirely click, and the cause is the direction. It's as if everyone's battery, including Scorsese's, had been overcharged and sparks were flying everywhere. There's virtually no violence but its absence is made up for by noise, lots of noise, lots of long arguments in which all parties scream at one another. Insane ebullience. No office of stock salesmen has ever been run like DeCaprio's -- people screaming and running around, snorting coke and dropping Ludes, and multiple couples banging away doggy style on the desk tops. The booze flows like Niagara. Erg for erg, joule for joule, decibel for decibel, I don't think this movie has ever been beaten.The dialog is very uneven. DeCaprio's narration is okay. It's a familiar device. But then a snippet of Robbie's voice over takes place, never to be heard again. Tha't clumsy editing. We don't learn too much that we don't already know when DeCaprio gives his evangelical speeches. Maybe the best conversational exchange is a very quiet and intimate one between DeCaprio and an FBI agent who is making what they call a 'threshold interview.' Both DeCaprio and the agent, Kyle Chandler, are phenomenal, their expressions and inflections unforgettable, as DeCaprio -- oh, so cleverly, so oleaginously -- offers Chandler a bribe without ever saying so. It's a simple scene. And it's believable in a way that the office orgies are not.I like Scorsese's work. He's one of a handful of directors, like the Coens, doing original stuff today. He needs to calm down. But 'The Wolf of Wall Street' is eminently watchable. There is another memorable scene, not to be missed, when DeCaprio is strung out on some dynamite Ludes and must roll down a brick stairway and crawl to his car.",7,0,3,28 June 2015
Bram Stoker's Dracula," A Stylish Rendition of a Familiar Tale.
","It's like an Italian prose opera in seventeen acts, full of directorial flourishes, special effects, and epic displays of elaborate wardrobe and intricate sets.Basically, it's the plot we're already familiar with from Bela Lugosi's first sound movie through various sequels and parodies. Renfield is a madman who eats flies. Harker goes to Castle Dracula to clinch a real estate deal with you-know-who, is semi-seduced by the brides, and imprisoned for a long time. Dracula takes a ship to London and moves into Carfax Abby. He sucks the blood of the frivolous Lucy and then turns his attention to the virginal Mina, fiancée of Harker, who has escaped from the Borga Pass and then Helsinki, I mean van Helsing, is called in on a consult and there is garlic and mirrors that crack and a cross that Himself finds disgusting and a narrow escape and the avoidance of daylight and smashed coffins in the castle basement and --What dazzling imagery! Coppola's camera first hides Harker's and Mina's kiss behind the tail of a peacock. The eye on one of the feathers becomes an iris that dilates and reveals a dreadful castle half hidden in roiling gray clouds that shade into a murky vermilion. It's a feast for the eyes. Gary Oldman's hair do alone is worth a look -- two revolting wedge-shaped buns of gray extending from his head at oblique angles. Not that either the costumes, the set dressing, or the production design in general strive for authenticity. It doesn't look like London or Rumania in 1895. It looks like a nightmare after a mushroom omelet, in which settings resembling a ghoul-haunted London and Rumania in 1895 manage, after a struggle, to put in an appearance. Winona Ryder is winsome with her too-tight bodice and long sleeves and those frightened calf-like eyes. Keanu Reeves is lightweight as Harker. Sir Anthony Hopkins' presence in the last half of the movie is encouraging because we all know it adumbrates the undoing of that bloodless freak and, thus, the end of the movie.All this effort has gone into a story that isn't really very interesting nor even, in its specifics, very original. I didn't care much who lived or died though I hoped for a happy outcome. The lighting is striking. Not one scene in broad daylight -- not that one would expect poplar leaves fluttering under a blazing autumn sun. Everything is murky and dark, as it is in all movies about the Undead. The creeping, luminous green mist was equally well done in 'Something Wicked This Way Comes.' The smoky shadows lurching around in the carnation light were from the Frank Langella version of the myth. The scene in which van Helsing holds the cross over the spasmodic body of Lucy, chanting 'the power of Christ compels you!', during which she vomits in his face, is immediately recognizable.Dull and overwrought.Unless, unless -- was it all meant to be a JOKE? Are we supposed to laugh when the Count tells Harker, 'I never drink . . . wine.' How about when Harker is first met at the Borga Pass by the black coach and the coachman is wearing the head of an enormous hawk? Or how about when one of Dracula's maids seems about to fellate Harker, opens her mouth to hiss at him, and reveals the incisors and canines of a saber-toothed tiger? Shouldn't any ONE of those things give Harker reason for pause?",5,6,10,15 October 2009
Die Hard with a Vengeance," Bang, bang -- then BOOM.
","As with any effective action movie, you're glued to the screen even as you goggle at the stupidity of it all. People get shot, sawed in half by wire ropes, blown up, run over by renegade subway trains, electrocuted by helicopters whose rotor blades make a mare's nest of high-tension power cables. I couldn't count the number of exploding fireballs. There are, I think, three maniacal car chases. (It depends on how you define car chase. Is a lone cab bounding at full speed through the woods of Central Park a 'car chase'?) It's like watching a Roadrunner cartoon. Bruce Willis is spat out of an aqueduct tunnel by the force of the water, loops through the air, and plops down into a mud puddle unhurt. 'Whew,' he's likely to say, 'what a #@#%!%#@^%!ing close call THAT was!' Samuel Jackson as his unwilling partner matches him step for step, in a plot partly structured along the lines of the old mismatched cop movies that ran out of steam a decade or so ago.Both Willis and Jackson are quite good for reasons most people already will recognize. There's nothing like a blood-covered Willis wisecracking and wincing with real pain as he extracts a piece of shrapnel from his flesh with his own teeth -- unless it's Jackson with his bulging eyes and crackling high voice responding angrily to some racist remark. 'Say WHUT?' I see I've kind of skipped much of the plot but it wanders off in several tenuously related directions anyway? Jeremy Irons with a faux German accent is the heavy and he belongs in a different movie. Nobody else registers.You know what it's like? It's like a comic pornographic film. 'Debby Does New York.' Exciting episode follows exciting episode and they are linked by only the slenderest of narrative threads.Let's see. That makes it a combination skin flick, mismatched cop movie, and Roadrunner cartoon. Hmmmm. Yeah, I guess that about covers it. It's tense, amusing, and filled with stunts. And if you're in the proper mood it's captivating.",6,1,2,6 April 2007
Con Air," A Zany Laff Riot
","SPOILERS.  Aboard a cargo plane filled with madmen and hostages and under fire from Army helicopters, Malkovitch, known as 'Cyrus the Virus' (cf., 'Hannibal the Cannibal'), grabs a filthy stuffed bunne and holds a pistol against it and shouts, 'Anybody tries anything and the bunny gets it.'  A skinheaded convict, Malkovitch is given the only lines in the movie that sound amusing -- or even meaningful.  'My proclivities are well known and often lamented in legal lore.'  Well, I suppose others have one or two good lines.  A huge airplane takes off towing a new car in the air behind it. A passenger stares at the flopping thing for a moment and remarks, 'Under other circumstances this might be considered unusual.'The rest of the dialogue can be thrown out.  The film jumps from one action scene to another.  The proclivities of the writers for one-line wisecracks are as intense as the effects people's (there must be a hundred listed in the credits) proclivities for producing exploding fireballs, usually with someone in the foreground trying to outrun the ballooning flame.  I have a proclivity for turning these kind of flicks off but also a penchant for hanging on in order to see just how vulgar the whole thing can become.  It ends with a wingless airplane landing amidst cars (don't worry; no bystanders are killed) on the Las Vegas strip.  Vulgarity piled upon vulgarity.But watching this thing also gave me a chance to try to figure out what makes Steve Buscemi what he is.  It's his high, deceptively harmelss-sounding voice, combined with a set of blue eyeballs like a child's agates, and flabby lips behind which there lurks one of the white plastic Dracula false teeth with prominent incisors that belong with a Halloween constume.  Every time he smiles, the viewer shudders.  He's supposed to be some sort of child killer but while his inmade buddies are demolishing hordes of junked cars and offing soldiers, he's sitting at a play table singing hyms with a little girl who somehow manages to survive the party. The director does his best to make us fear for the helpless lamb's welfare, since there are multiple shots of Buscemi leering at her, but nothing happens.  It's as if Frankenstein's monster never threw his playmate into the lake.Then there is Nick Cage.  He has long convict-type hair in this one, and he's all bulked up and muscular.  Why do actors show such proclivities these days?  In addition to Cage we've seen Charlie Sheen, John Travolta, and of course Sylvester Stallone.  And who knows how many actors tried and gave up out of boredom.  I mean -- can you imagine Jimmy Stewart bulked up?  Or Gary Cooper with Schwarzenegger's physique?John Cusack has a thankless role.  He is to Nick Cage's ex-Ranger inmate as, say, Alec Baldwin was to Sean Connery's Russian submarine skipper in 'The Hunt for Red October.'  The succulent Monica Potter might as well be elsewhere.  Rachel Ticotin is one of the good people, locked in a cage aboard the hijacked aircraft, constantly in jeopardy.  Rape always lurks ominously in the background when your captors are a bunch of dim-witted libidinous thugs -- except for one Hispanic transvestite who, come to think of it, doesn't look too bad in short skirts.  At any rate, he looks better as a woman than Hillary Swank looked as a man.The editing is so poor that the action during the action scenes, meaning almost the entire movie, can't really be followed.  We lose track of who's where, of who's doing what to whom, of what machine that particular chunk of falling metal belongs to, of where the smoke is coming from, of what the hell is going on.Not that it matters much.  The violence is a Ding an Sich.  The plot is too full of holes to really bother describing.  I'll mention one puzzler.  The huge cargo plane lands at a deserted airport but the pilot loses control and the monstrous cumbersome thing plows off the runway through mountains of desert sand and decapitates a couple of shacks along the way.  How are you going to get it to fly again?  You get the convicts together tugging on ropes, pull the airplane out of the hole it's dug for itself, start it up and fly it away, that's how.It's impossible to take this in the least bit seriously without doing yourself a big disfavor.  It's the kind of movie in which, when the airplane is finally finished careering down the strip, demolishing every grotesque neon sign in sight and smashing into one of the casinos, it comes to rest with its radar bulb just barely nudging a slot machine, which then rings up 3 sevens and ejaculates a bucketfull of coins.  It's amusing at that level all the way through, beginning with the punny title.  I can't honestly say this movie is enjoyable, but it's fascinating, watching things sink as low as they possibly can.",Null,2,2,25 January 2003
"Hail, Caesar!"," Life At The Top.
","In its subdued way this is a hilarious movie.Brolin is the manager of a movie studio in the post-war years who must keep things rolling. He's a devout Catholic. His last confession was 27 minutes ago Brolin likes his current job despite the tension but he's been offered a higher-paying position. He hesitatingly asks the priest during confession about the conundrum. Should he keep his current job, which he feels is 'right', or take the newly offered one? The priest thinks for a moment and replies, 'God always wants us to do what's right, my son. You see, God has given us this inner light --' 'Yeah, yeah, I got it,' says Brolin and bolts impatiently out of the confessional.The narrative has Brolin making a movie called 'Hail Caesar' starring Clooney. But Cloony is drugged, kidnapped, and brainwashed by a handful of egghead communists, including one mastermind with an absurd foreign accent.It works. Clooney is released. He returns to the studio and explains dialectical materialism to Brolin in his office. Brolin fumes. When Clooney says something like, 'It's all a game by the vested interests to deprive us of our dignity,' the scowling manager says, 'It is, huh?', barely able to stifle his fury, and finally leaps around the desk and slaps Clooney out of it. The actor meekly obeys.I won't go on about the plot. It's filled with the Coens' usual irony. At the end, Clooney gives a truly transformative speech as the foot of the cross. The entire crew is enthralled by his passion. Then he forgets the last word of the speech and ruins the shot.It's scored by Carter Burwell whom I admire for his compositional talent and his sense of humor. Brolin's main conflict has been between religion and a coarser conformity. And under the end credits -- while the theater is emptying -- Burwell plays a beautiful rendition of a traditional Russian song, along the lines of 'Kalinka,' performed by the superlative Red Army Chorus. When they're finished, we hear what sounds like a hymnal from Mitteleuropa. In between there are discreet peeps of a sonar apparatus, presumably looking for an ideological submarine, and when everything else is finished there is the cry of a distant siren.",7,0,1,22 February 2017
American Gangster," Noble Cops and Gangsters.
","It's kind of messy, the way real life is, but that's okay. It's also okay that it borrows some scenes and themes from 'The Godfather' and 'The French Connection' too. It's still a well-done original.Russel Crowe is an honest cop in Essex County (Newark), New Jersey. He finds a bag full of money from a dope dealer and turns it in, as he's supposed to, although this violates the police practice of keeping that sort of dough. It earns him snubs at the office.Across the river, In Manhattan, Denzel Washington is a driver and protégé of a big time Harlem heroin dealer. When the dealer dies, Washington take over the business, eliminates the middle men, and charges less money for dope that's far superior. It earns him the enmity of all the other dealers because he's undercutting them. They are not admirers of the unfettered free market, never having read Adam Smith. The NYPD is as crooked as the cops in Newark. Everybody wants a cut.Meanwhile, back in dystopian Newark, a special squad of drug enforcement cops is organized and Crowe is assigned to lead them. Their mission, should they choose to accept it, which they'd better, is to disregard the many junkies and street corner operators and go for the big game. In this case, after much sniffing around, in and out of their jurisdiction, Crowe's elite group finds Washing to be at the head of the organization, more powerful and richer than the Italians or anyone else.Crowe finally busts Washington, earns a law degree, and after prosecuting him in court, defends him and gets him off after only fifteen years. Both men were consultants on the film and both bitched about its inaccuracies.It was considerably better than I'd thought it would be. I mean, look at the title: 'American Gangster.' Roger Corman would have had a field day with it.Instead, there are several parallel stories interwoven with one another. Washington brings his family from North Carolina to New York and sets them up in his mansion. His mother is Ruby Dee, who was my co-star in the unforgettable mini-series -- umm, er, whatever it was. He attends church with them, says an earnest grace before meals. What kind of a gangster do you call that? There is, of course, a final kinetic shoot out, intercut with scenes of Washington at Sunday church service. Very ironic, as 'The Godfather' showed. But you won't find too much gore in the movie. There are murders and suicides on the screen but the camera lens isn't splashed with blood.Both Washington and Crowe deliver decent performances, as does the supporting cast. No one stands out. They're all professionals. This isn't a masterpiece, it's not gripping like, say, 'Prince of the City,' but it's a neatly done genre piece that's worth catching.",7,0,1,1 July 2016
Stranger Than Fiction," Third Person Omniscient.
","This fantasy begins as a blend of 'The Truman Show' with a soupçon of 'The Accidental Tourist' and I expected a tricky commercial property designed in the course of some overnight caffeine binge to bring in as many shekels as possible. It's better than that, and I wound up waiting rather tensely to see how the thing would turn out.Will Ferrell is an obsessive-compulsive IRS auditor who lives a heavily regimented life, dictated by the reminders on his multiple-function wrist watch, joyless and humorless. He's as boring as they come. We just KNOW some hot babe or something is going to turn his life upside down, and it does.He begins to hear a woman's voice inside his head. The voice describes what he's doing and what he has done, down to the smallest detail, using the third person or his actual name -- Harold Crick. Something is going on but Ferrell doesn't know what. The voice at first puzzles him, then irritates him. He shouts out demands that it stop, but the only things that stop are other pedestrians who stare at him. Actually, this being New York, I think he could stand in the street and shout all he likes without any interference.I don't want to spell out all the plot developments because the story is a little complicated. Ferrell sees a shrink, Linda Hunt, who refers him to a professor of literature, Dustin Hoffman, who may be able to figure out what kind of narrative he's listening to -- and living. It's a tragedy, as it turns out, and Ferrell had better find out whose writing it before he's killed off. The writer turns out to be real enough, a blocked novelist, Emma Thompson, and Ferrell tracks her down and they work things out, so to speak. There's the inevitable spirit-of-life woman too, Maggie Gyllenhaal, who introduces him to love, milk and cookies, and Tiffany lamps. With this kind of narrative it's only natural to ask if the 'writer' stands for Somebody Else. I mean, here is someone laying out the course of a human life. Is Thompson God? Can God be a woman who has writer's block and smokes too much? Nahh. Woman, yes. Writer's block and smoking, no. The best performances are from Emma Thompson, Byllenhall, and Dustin Hoffman. Will Ferrell looks and acts the part of a man whose favorite word is 'integer' but he does so uninterestingly. On the other hand, it's a tough part. Maybe Bill Murray would have handled it.In a plot as tricky as this there are bound to be lacunae in the logic. For instance, he's trying to track down the genuine source of the voice in his head. He discovers the voice seems to belong to a real writer. But the voice has used some strange locutions. I'd have started my investigation by Googling the word 'unmitigatable.' See who's used it before. There couldn't be that many.And then too, Ferrell finally finds and confronts the author of his life, Emma Thompson, takes the almost-finished manuscript to Dustin Hoffman, and it is agreed by all concerned that the story must end tragically with Ferrell's death. Nonsense. Why couldn't Thompson have written the thing as a tragedy then added a single, final sentence -- 'And he woke up to find it had all been a dream'? It worked in Fritz Lang's 'Woman in the Window.' And as for literature, 'Finnegans Wake' is ALL dream.Plaudits to the writer though. There's some clever stuff going on here, which overcomes occasional distractions in the direction. It's too bad that Ferrell is as unengaging as he is. He's even uninteresting when he wises up and begins to stretch out. There seems to be a big hole in the screen when he appears, and he's the central figure.The movie may be a little too charmed by its own premise. Still -- overall -- it's a more thoughtful film than you might anticipate, not as gimmicky as it sounds. Would have made a good novel.",7,0,0,6 September 2008
The Reader," Mature Tale of Love, Guilt, Undoing.
","In the era of the Beatles a young law student, David Kross, has an intense affair with an older woman, Kate Winslet. She loves it when he reads to her -- 'Ulysses,' 'Huckleberry Finn,' Chekhov. The fling lasts only one summer, then Winslet disappears. One of Kross's seminars takes a field trip to a court in which half a dozen women are being tried for crimes committed during the war, twenty-five years earlier. Kross is flabbergasted to find that Winslet is not only a defendant but appears to have been the leader of the female guards, and the one who made the decision to allow concentration camp inmates to die in a flaming church rather than free them and allow 'chaos' on the streets.Winslet winds up sentenced to life in prison. After ten years or so, Kross -- now morphed into an adult who looks exactly like Ralph Feinnes -- begins sending her taped copies of books, which she devours.After twenty years she is due for release but has no family or other contacts except Feinnes. He's never visited her or written to her but he's the only person who is in a position to help her after so many years of imprisonment.A couple of things stand out. One is Kate Winslet's performance. It's a difficult role. She must age twenty years on screen, and she must somehow combine pathos with a grim determination -- and she does it. She was only in her early thirties when this was shot but she matures convincingly, aided by discrete make up that gives her gray hair and rubescent eyelids.During her affair with the virginal Kross, who looks hardly old enough to be in high school, let alone university, she's constantly taking baths and showers, which was fine with me. She even takes to having Kross stand naked in the tub while she roughly scrubs him down, haunted, we suppose, by guilt. (Cf., Lady MacBeth.) Mostly she dominates him, ordering him around, postponing their love making until after he reads to her. Why does she want him to read books aloud? Because she's illiterate. The viewer doesn't get to know this until she is in prison. We see her painfully printing simple notes to Feinnes about what kind of books to read on tape ('more romance'), crossing out mispellings -- the assiduous scrawl of a kindergarten child.The word 'redemption' is, I think, way overused. It has a religious ring to it that doesn't always apply, and certainly not here. Time to substitute Freud's 'undoing', a no-nonsense, strictly non-metaphysical act of 'making up' for the harm you've done. In this case, it devolves into the delivery of a cheap tin can that once held tea and now holds a pitifully small amount of carefully saved money, a carefully nurtured nest egg of no consequence at all.",7,1,1,20 February 2010
Jaws," Epitome of Tension.
","Much of this comment will, I realize, be meandering, spotty, and anecdotal, but what with more than 500 reviews of this movie already on file, how much can be lost by a bit of negative entropy? I think we can skip the story except to say fish eats man, man finally kills fish. The fish was called Bruce, or was it Moby Bruce. Roy Scheider is the chief of police of a resort fishing village on an island. He's the local authority so often found in monster movies. Murray Hamilton is the superior who doesn't trust or believe Scheider. Richard Dreyfus is the requisite scientist -- often but not always a toothsome babe. In this case the expert can be a man because Scheider is already happily married, with children, as the first half of the movie establishes. Robert Shaw is Quint, an anomaly, the rough, tough shark fisherman who has contempt for ordinary people. Usually that's part of the police chief's role.The movie was a HUGE popular and commercial success, and for good reason. The visuals and special effects are perfectly realized, the music nail-bitingly suspense inducing, and the characters are not cardboard cutouts as they so often are in routine action thrillers.Take Scheider's sheriff. He has a family and he loves them but the bond is projected in everyday ways. A cheaper script would have him telling his kids, just as he's about to leave on a suicide mission, how much he loves them and if he doesn't come back -- well, just remember to do what your mother tells you and don't forget to brush your teeth regularly and visit a dentist twice a year and stay away from women with barbed-wire tattoos. Scheider does none of that, and if he ever even kisses his wife, I managed to miss it this time around.Furthermore, unlike so many action/science fiction/horror protagonists, Scheider is flawed. Not seriously, but still -- afraid of being on the water? So phobic that he must consume a couple of bottles of wine and get drunk in order to board a boat? It's played mostly for comic effect, but Scheider isn't given any excuse for his fears either. He didn't watch his Dad drown or get waterboarded as a prisoner or anything like that.The most interesting character, though, is Shaw's Quint, the crack shark hunter. We're talking major league Hemingwayism here. Shaw wears a fishing cap just like Papa's, he's vulgar, he dislikes college kids, he drinks home-made 'hootch', he's been through a war -- a man's man in every respect. And when it comes to Bruce, he is wrong at every turn. He makes all the mistakes in the book out of an excess of self confidence, smashing the boat's radio, deliberately burning out an engine bearing, and paying for it as a Hemingway hero would. Gulp. There has rarely been a more interesting case study of overreaching.Sharks as a group aren't evil in themselves. As Dreyfus explains, all they do is eat and make little sharks, only one or two incremental evolutionary units below humans in those respects. Hordes of three-foot blue sharks used to come up in our chum stream off Sandy Hook and I used to reach into the water from our outboard, grab one by the tail, and flip it flapping and spinning overhead. They're like pussy cats. It's only when they get bigger that they get spookier. I was on a fishing boat anchored about fifty feet of Olosega Island in Samoa and a couple of guys dived overboard and swam ashore in the most casual way. I happened to look down over the other side and there, barely moving through the electric blue water, was a dusky monster I estimated at about eight feet. I was tickled pink I wasn't swimming along joking and laughing with the others. In this instance, Bruce gets his just deserts. He's got an explosive CO2 container lodged in his cheek. The enormous blast fills the air with tiny chondroblasts.The director and composer haven't misjudged their audience often in this movie but they get carried away in one noticeable scene. Now get this. Bruce has eaten several people and has just revealed himself as more of a whale than a shark, and he's performed incredible feats of strength, enough even to impress Quint, who has seen everything. Now Bruce has a couple of highly buoyant plastic barrels attached to him and he's plowing through the water paying no attention to the drag. Scheider, Shaw, and Dreyfus are pursuing him in the fishing boat, its engine full out, barely able to keep up with this man-eating beast. And the musical score suddenly switches from its well-know THUM THUM -- THUM THUM -- to light-hearted happy music, as if we were watching two youngsters having an exciting but tame adventure, an exhilarating horse race through the woods. I wonder if anyone else felt the music was a little discordant. I'm happy though that Shaw, for all his faults, used the word 'hootch' in this movie. It means 'illegal liquor' and it comes from the language of the Tlingit Indians who live along the mountainous northwest coast of Alaska and Canada, a cheerful, industrious group. Not enough Tlingit words have been borrowed into English. 'Cayuse' is the only other one I can think of.",8,1,4,29 May 2007
The Wrestler," Requiem for a wrestler.
","The performances are uniformly fine, especially Mickey Rourke's dilapidated wrestler with his battered face. But Marisa Tomei is excellent too. She's a lap dancer and a bit more worn than Mona Lisa Vitti was. Rachel Evan Wood isn't on screen much but gets passing grades if only for her classically beautiful profile.The movie stinks, although I don't think it knows it. It creaks at every joint, like Rourke, as it reaches for epic tragedy -- a proud man who will never allow himself to be beaten, even if it costs him his life, although in this instance the effort can hardly be worth it. Rourke simply knows the ropes of this phony, thoroughly choreographed business to well to take it as seriously as the script demands. The arena is so corrupt that a pissing contest acquires Olympic proportions by comparison.The script is out of Screen writing 101 or McKee's textbook. First, show us something of the world the protagonist inhabits. It's a strenuous performance in the ring with real staples, barbed wire, chisels, chairs, and whatnot causing the blood to flow like Niagara while a thousand fans shriek with pleasure at each new brutality. Afterwards the actors ask each other, 'Was you okay with the staples?' There must be a fragile romance developed between the clobbered lead and some babe in an equally degraded job. Throw in a member of the hero's alienated family, preferably a stunning young woman, for the thirteen-year-olds who may otherwise be bored when no one is having his body wrapped in barbed wire.There must be a few set speeches at important moments. Confessions and apologies are always good, but so are barely controlled hysterical outbursts. 'I know I'm just a hunk of meat. I'm alone and I deserve to be alone. I just don't want you to hate me.' (A tear should roll down the speaker's cheek.) Marlon Brando had such a set speech with Rod Steiger in the back seat of a taxi but the lines glowed with verisimilitude, Brando delivered them with perfection, without pandering, he didn't have to cry. And the speech told us something that we didn't know, that hadn't already been shown to us. Rourke's speech only spells out what we can easily intuit. The writer doesn't trust us to be perceptive enough to have picked it all up. Tugging our heart strings in a way as cheap as the faux contests in the ring.Dramatic structure -- triumph followed by tragedy followed by triumph followed by tragedy followed by -- where were we? The direction is rudimentary. Every significant statement is a close up. But why go on? You've seen it all before in one or another form: 'Requiem for a Heavyweight', for instance.It has some nice features though. The location shooting, all over wintertime New Jersey, couldn't be more evocative. Asbury Park looked from the outside exactly as it did fifty years ago. And the incongruity of the burly, battered Rourke in a plastic snood working behind the deli counter cracking wise with the customers. And Rourke staying up partying all night, then stumbling drunkenly out of some strange girl's apartment, staggering home, throwing himself fully clothed onto his bed, and sleeping until darkness falls. It was one of the few times I thought that I knew exactly how Rourke felt.See it once, if you're curious. Rourke is unimpeachable. But it's not a good film.",5,2,6,28 November 2009
Kingpin," Two Guys Walk Into a Bowling Alley....
","This often-amusing piece of trash begins with a scene out of Paul Newman's 'The Hustler.' Bill Murray sees the latent bowling talent in Woody Harrelson, cultivates it, and they set out hustling small-town rubes. Harrelson pretends to be drunk and is faced with an impossible frame. Everyone bets against him and when he makes the spare, he and Murray split the money. That is, until finally some clot of rubes wakes up to the scam and grinds Harrelson's bowling hand off, while Murray cheerfully speeds off alone.A tragic tale. Harrelson is a real down-and-outer in Baltimore, forced to service his landlady in lieu of the rent. She has a face like Euryale the gorgon and he vomits voluminously after the bout.Then he gets a lucky break. He spots a young man, Randy Quaid, from a neighboring Amish town who has the same talented touch with a bowling ball, and persuades him to take to the road. They hustle their way to the million-dollar championship bowl off in Reno, Nevada, picking up some enemies along the way, not to mention Vanessa Angel. The two final contestants are Harrelson, bowling with his hook instead of his hand, and the egomaniacal Murray.I didn't think it was as inventive as 'There's Something About Mary'. There is no equivalent of Ben Stiller's arrest at the roadside tea room. Yet it is funny and it gets funnier as it meanders along. Some of the gags are silly and pointless -- the burly Quaid dressed in tights and doing a pole dance. But there's wit in some of the visual gags -- Harrelson bending over a cute baby, making goo goo sounds, and chucking it under the chin with his hook while the mother's eyes bulge with anxiety.And the dialog has its moments too. 'You know, you're not the most intelligent person on earth.' 'Oh, yeah, and who are you, Alfred Einstein?' Then there are the performances, uniformly professional. We'll begin with Vanessa Angel. Yes, let's begin with her. The English-born actress has a mellifluous voice, a little throaty, and is strikingly attractive, a paragon of pulchritude. Oh, yum.Quaid is a large, clumsy actor but his role rather suits him -- the stolid, God-fearing, son of the soil, who takes his first automobile ride and shortly afterwards is taking hits from a long blue bong.Harrelson doesn't exactly have an actor's elocution. He has a weak voice and usually sounds as if he's reading his lines from some off-screen cue card. But he excels at light comedy, especially when the comedy has a slightly deranged quality, as it does here.Murray plays it straight at first but the final confrontation in Reno gives him a chance to unwind. He is absolutely hilarious, seen on television in a parody of one of those ad miseracordiam commercials for 'Unified Way'. 'Little Charlotte here has never eaten a hot dog in her life. She lives in poverty and depends on your donations to keep her alive.' Meanwhile, Murray is copping feels from the local mothers and daughters. I laughed out loud when Murray wept with joy at the prospect of beating Harrelson at the championship bowl off.I'm glad we see a little bit of what looks like Reno too. Reno is a pleasant, laid back little city. I've spent many cozy nights there at the elegant Mapes Hotel, sleeping in the lobby.",6,0,2,22 April 2015
Shooter," Action Movie With Attempt at Import.
","I missed the opening of this film and that may account for some of my confusion about who was who and who was doing what to whom. I gather that Mark Wahlberg is an expert sniper who has been framed for the assassination of an African archbishop and wounded in the process of escape. I never had a clear idea of who Wahlberg was working for. Sometimes he's called 'Gunny,' which suggests the Marine Corps. At any rate, he's a phenomenal shot. His grouping on the range is something like an inch and a half -- and that's at ten hundred yards (or was it ten thousand), which is the length of ten football fields. I don't believe it but -- okay, he's a great shot.It's clear who the bad guys are though. This isn't much more than a lone avenger in an action movie, after all. He's been set up and is now pursued by the FBI under the leadership of Danny Glover. They chase him all over the place and he barely escapes each time. He's aided by an honest FBI agent (Michael Pena) but mainly he survives each attempt on his life because (1) he has second sight, and (2) his enemies always miss while he never does.Is Mark Wahlberg handsome? I keep reading that he is, but to me he looks like any of the ordinary guys I went to high school with. Some of them wound up with checkered pasts too. But my chief impression of Mark Wahlberg is that he has considerable talent as an actor. He was quite good in 'The Departed'. But in this film, locked as it is into strict genre conventions, he doesn't have a chance to display much of his talent. I mean, it's the Steven Seagal role. What the hell can anybody do with it? There's an attempt at social significance, perhaps with the general idea of cashing in on the public's cynicism and anger towards the recent cascade of scandals and recklessly arrogant preemptions. Imagine a corrupt group within the FBI, acting on the orders of a corrupt sitting Senator (Ned Beatty) to eliminate opposition to the construction of a pipeline through an African country. And which organization comes to the rescue? The Department of Justice ('thanks to the separation of powers'). Well, it's pretty nervy in its intent.There is some nice location shooting, including a couple of scenes on a trackless and snowy slope among some majestic mountains. The requisite action scenes are well done too. I kwelled when Wahlberg walks away from a house and it explodes behind him. And what does he do? He continues walking. A less imaginative director would have Wahlberg dive in slow motion towards the camera while the fireball blooms behind him.Not a bad film, for what it is.",6,1,5,21 December 2008
Inception," Mind Boggling.
","Around 750, the renowned poet of the Tang dynasty, Li Po, is supposed to have asked, 'Last night I dreamed I was a butterfly. Today, am I a butterfly dreaming I am a man?' Marcus Aurelius, the late Roman emperor and philosopher, wrote, 'Life is a dream, a little more coherent than most.' Freud concluded that dreams were the fulfillment of unconscious wishes that had managed to sneak past the dozing censor. Aboriginal Australians believed in a real parallel universe called The Dream Time in which everything and everyone who ever existed, still existed, and anybody could enter this place during sleep.Modern psychology believes that dreams are nothing more than random cortical bombardment caused by a lot of activity in sub-cortical structures associated with the filing of memories, and the cortex goes into overdrive trying to make narrative sense of them. Sex dreams are pleasant enough except when the furry little animals show up, but statistics demonstrate that the majority of dreams are truly lousy, the kind we can easily live without. Don't you get tired of running in slow motion through a swamp while being chased by an ogre? Does all this sound like pointless rambling to you? Well, then you're not going to enjoy 'Inception' because it meanders at lightning speed all over the place and lives by no rules that human beings have ever known.On the other hand, if you find these adventitious allusions in some way interesting, then you should see this dark and muddled movie. You get a bonus too, because in its style it closely resembles an action movie from the 1980s. Everything is happening all at once -- or maybe not all at once. Who cares? The point is that people get shot in the forehead and buildings comes toppling down for no reason and slow-motion explosions take place at irregular but short intervals.I'm getting pretty tired of seeing films that use some bewildering metaphysical scheme as an excuse to show off still more CGIs. I couldn't watch this thing through.",2,39,71,18 June 2011
Lord of War," Badfellas.
","The protagonist, Nicholas Cage (nee Nicholas Coppola), grows up with his younger brother, Jared Leto, in an immigrant community in Brooklyn in the 1980s. Crime and shootings are all around. Soon, the street-savvy Cage latches on to a way to make some money out of the deal. 'It's not white and it's not black. It's the way I like it, gray.' Cage narrates the movie in a cool and ironic way, explaining things to us like a tourist guide.His working-class parents are morally upright but Cage and his brother begin selling weapons small time. The ambitious Cage begins to make higher-echelon friends and graduates to a larger scale enterprise, with phony passports, international sales trips, bribery, networking his relatives in the Ukraine, and whatnot. His chief product is the AK 47, which is cheap, reliable, and simple to operate.And the work itself is surprisingly easy. Okay. You have a few dozen attack helicopters you want to ship from one point to another but it's against the law to ship armed helicopters. It's not against the law to ship the weapons and the ammunition, just the craft themselves. No problem. You just unship the weapons and transport them separately. If anyone objects to the helicopters, you tell them they are now rescue craft. The bribery helps smooth over complicated transactions.Usually, the transactions are even simpler. After the collapse of the USSR, the Ukraine was without a functioning government but had stores of AK 47s. If the inventory says there are, say, 41,000 such automatic weapons, Cage points out to the officer in charge that that '4' looks like a '1' to him. The bribery smooths things over.Cage acquires as a wife a slinky model whose photos he's always salivated over, though he tells her nothing about his business. He leaves his brother behind, as he climbs the ladder, pursued now by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms as well as Interpol.Now he's fabulously wealthy. His stretch limousine purrs as it swooshes him through the streets of Manhattan. There are women on the side, of course, although he has to be careful in Africa -- too many cases of AIDS and too few condoms. And that ten-ton car? He has to watch it sometimes because it's being tracked by the occasional helicopter. Then, too, once in a while one of his cars explodes when someone tries to start it.The ending has Cage trying to reform but being forced by one of his clients into a last deal. It's trickier than he thought, and he loses his brother. Then his wife finds out what he's been up to and she takes their child and leaves him flat.Cage is arrested by his nemesis, Ethan Hawke, but is released by an officer of high rank in the U.S. Army. The government finds Cage's services sometimes valuable. Sometimes the government wants arms to reach a certain group without the government itself having been involved. Private enterprise, you know, solves a lot of problems. Cage regrets his losses but shrugs them off and goes back to what he does so well, selling illegal arms on the international market. He doesn't say, 'Why mess with a good thing?', but he might as well have.Now -- who directed it? WRONG. It's not Michael Scorsese. It's Andrew Nicol, who also wrote it.You can tell it's not Scorsese because, though it may end in resignation and acceptance, the film clearly disapproves of the events that play out on the screen. There is a rather lengthy epilogue and a fantasy shot of millions of empty cartridges in case we haven't gotten the point yet.Nicholas Cage is reliable as the narrator and protagonist. He's always reliable, no matter how shabby the part, and this part isn't shabby. Of course the subject could hardly be more important. Nukes are nothing compared to the dangers presented by a sea of Kalashnikov 47s, which have killed millions and are now represented on one African country's coin and another's national flag.Nice photography. Nice production values. When a scene is supposed to take place in Sudan, we can believe it's the Sudan. And Monrovia, the capital of Liberia, looks thoroughly dilapidated and ratty.There are times when the film's joints creak as it reaches out to instruct the more naive among us -- that final shot of a carpet of empty brass, and the narrator's comment that every warlord's group has some fancy name like 'Democratic Freedom Fighters.' Well, you know, if we haven't slept through this century so far, we probably already know that.None of this criticism should prevent anyone from watching the movie. It alternates pedagogy with brutality in the manner of Scorsese's better works.",8,0,0,12 May 2011
The Good Shepherd," A Spy Story, Tense and Subdued.
","I don't know. I called it a spy story because that's what leaps to mind, an available schema. But as much as it's about Matt Damon's dull CIA bureaucrat, it's about fathers and sons or, more generally, about allegiances. Do I owe more to my 'family' or to my 'country'? Of course John Wayne grappled with this question in a dozen movies, but they never boiled down to the question of whether or not to sacrifice your son, one of the few people you've loved, for the sake of an ironbound sub-unit of the big bureaucracy that represents the government. That's a hard choice for a guy to make, whether he's Abraham or Matt Damon's spook.It's rather a long, slow slog through this film, a somewhat disjointed journey from Damon's years as a member of Bones at Yale, through the intrigues of World War II, to the final failure of The Bay of Pigs in Cuba. CIA was wrong on Bay of Pigs. (A character tells us why there is never a 'the' used before 'CIA'. For the same reason there is no 'the' before 'God'.) However, whatever the advice of the CIA, and since I am a non-insider I can use 'the'. We seem all too eager to believe our own myths about the suffering, imprisoned people living under a dictator who are eager for us to foment rebellion so they can rise up, throw off the mean yoke of subjugation, and greet us as liberators.It IS a long story of one man's career and his off-stage life, what there is of it. But Robert DeNiro, the director of the film, handles it with efficiency and delicacy. He's helped immeasurably by splendid photography and extremely good performances from his cast. One might imagine that DeNiro, of Mediterranean descent, might find it hard to get into the skins of these upper-class, mirthless, zombified WASPS with their high IQs and schoolboy loyalties, but actually DeNiro does quite well.He doesn't take the easy way, the cheap way, of explaining these lives to us. Angelina Jolie as Damon's wife drifts away from him because he's absent from home for years at a time and seems, well, joyless. But there is no such speech. Instead DeNiro treats the audience as adults and let's us figure it out pretty much for ourselves. It's true that the only REAL existences seem to come from ethnic types -- DeNiro himself as the director of the CIA, modeled after Wild Bill Donovan, and Joe Pesci in a tiny part as a possible hit man, who asks very sensibly, 'The Italians have their families and the church, the Irish have their homeland, even the N*****s have their music. But what have YOU guys got?' ('I have the United States of America,' replies Damon.) DeNiro doesn't make the mistake of assuming these WASPS have no feelings. They just express them differently, not through loud parties or hugs and kisses or facial expressions of operatic magnitude. They express them in stares, or glances, and in measured, calculated speech. It's human alright but they're using a different code than the rest of us are used to. It's another intelligent decision on the director's part.The price the movie pays for such adult techniques is that nothing much seems to be happening on the screen at any given moment. I wound up getting lost from time to time. And, really, Matt Damon's character is so specialized, so small in everything he pays sincere attention to, that he reminded me of Vladimir Nabokov's obsession with the genitalia of the butterfly, only without the continental charm.An interesting film, despite its lack of action. The little action there is, is quickly over with, or, as in the case of Michael Gambon's murder by the OSS, it takes place at some distance, off screen, and is only suggested by the most horrific of terrified screams from the distant victim. If you want a similar story -- young man gets into an agency at the beginning and grows up with it -- that is colorful, full of drama and action, leaves nothing to the imagination, commercially oriented and completely without challenge -- a comic-strip movie -- try 'The FBI Story' with James Stewart.It's also kind of interesting to get some idea of what goes on inside Skull and Bones. (Our current president is a member.) I was at Yale for a while but nobody tapped me. Now I'm glad.",7,3,5,17 July 2007
Stalag 17," Crashing Out.
","'Stalag 17' betrays its stage origins. The director, Billy Wilder, has opened it up a bit to show the assembly area in the middle of a dismal continental winter in Germany but most of the action takes place inside Barracks Four, where about two dozen Air Force sergeants are kept as POWs.William Holden gets the lead and is the pivotal figure but it's really an ensemble movie with memorable characters and some equally impressive scenes. It may seem a bit hokey now but when it ran on Broadway in 1951 and 1952, the war was only a few years behind us and still fresh in our memories, so what seems stilted now was news at the time.Among the two dozen inmates of Barracks Four, Holden is the odd man out, a wheeler and dealer with a treasure chest of wine, cigarettes, silk stockings, and other delicacies. The sociologist, Erving Goffman, described such places as 'total institutions' in which life was regimented. Part of any functioning total institution was what he called 'the small reward system.' And Holden is the savvy broker who seems to win every bet and whose prices for small rewards resemble usury. He was stuck in the role of operator for several other films, such as 'The Bridge on the River Kwai' and 'Sunset Boulevard,' and he was good at it.One of the better performances is Otto Preminger's as the camps commander, Colonel von Scherbach. His imperious mien is overdone to the point of hilarity. He struts about, making flippant remarks about dead bodies, has a subordinate put on his boots and then take them off again. As a director he was intimidating and authoritarian. One wonders how he took direction from Billy Wilder.Amid all the jokes and improbable events there is one moment of genuine pathos. A complete slob of a POW, Robert Strauss, gets drunk on Christmas and convinces himself that his friend, Harvey Lembeck, is really his ideal woman, Betty Grable. The men dance with each other, Strauss whispers into Lembeck's ear how much he loves her, how he dreams about her every day. When Lembeck, stunned, brings him back to reality, Strauss breaks down into a torrent of convincing tears. It's the only moment in the movie that isn't undercut by irony, cynicism, or triteness.It's a tightly written comedy/drama and not likely to be forgotten quickly.",7,0,1,21 October 2013
The Shawshank Redemption," Time and Pressure.
","Keeping this short and sweet, meek Tim Robbins is a convicted accountant who is sent to a real MEAN prison in Maine. The captain of the corrections officers, the massive-jawed Clancy Brown, is quick with his baton, agitato, so to speak. The warden, Bob Gunton, is a corrupt dictator. Morgan Freeman, serving a life sentence, becomes a friend of Robbins. Robbins has a lot in the upper story and goes about doing good for the penitentiary and for the inmates, despite the beatings, attempted rapes, and unjust punishment. Under his management the library becomes a beacon for all prison libraries. Many brutal years pass before Robbins, an amateur geologist, tunnels through the prison wall, hauling a bundle of ill-gotten pelf, crawls into a five-hundred yard long sewer pipe filled with excreta, and splashes through a river to freedom and a tiny coastal village in Mexico, Zijuataneco. I drove there about the time this escape takes place and it really WAS a cheap, peaceful, fishing town with an irregular water supply. Now it's a metropolis. After forty years of imprisonment, Freeman is finally paroled. He joins his friend Robbins in Mexico, where they pursue an honest living as simple fishermen and become lovers for life. (Kidding.) It's a long movie but a gripping one. Movies about prisons are difficult to make. The surroundings are hardly epic, the wardrobe drab, the inmates participate in what the sociologist Erving Goffman called 'the small rewards' system common to all total institutions -- gifts and trades of items like cigarettes and harmonicas. The inmates have humble jobs, nothing exciting about working in a laundry. No women. Threats and occasional fist fights but no open warfare. And here there's not even the suspense of watching men prepare for an escape. How do you fold these conditions together and come up with a story? The people who produced 'The Shawshank Redemption' have managed to pull it off, and without directorial display -- no fireworks, no instant cutting, no screechy metallic noise on the sound track, no razzle dazzle whatever, just classic movie making. The success of the film is helped ENORMOUSLY by Morgan Freeman's performance as the friend of Robbins. He's an exceptional actor, and though we may see him now mostly in the role of mentor, his early performances as a heavy shouldn't be ignored. God, he was one charming and terrifying pimp in 'Street Smart.' Robbins does a good job too, although his role requires him to be subdued. It also requires him to be saintly, alas. There's nothing wrong with him. He's a genius, doing everybody's tax returns. He's more sinned against than sinning. Cool Hand Luke at least was reckless and expedient and brought the storm down upon himself. And Luke's guards would have made mincemeat out of Robbins. Robbins' prison is a kind of fantasy land in which he can at will commandeer an office, lock the doors, and play a record of an opera over all the loudspeakers. It's also a pipe dream to believe that all of the inmates would stop what they're doing and stare in wonder at the loudspeakers broadcasting two ladies singing in Italian. Slim Whitman, maybe. But Joan Sutherland? They would have booed. Nor would inmates show the kind of solidarity on display here, once Robbins pulls them together. The coolest presentation of self in an institution like this is utter indifference, except for some offense against the honor of one's self or one's gang. It's a cold-hearted place in which practically nobody applauds when someone else succeeds.However, put all the fantasy aside and accept it for what it is, a fictional tale of men who pay dearly for misdeeds and ultimately save themselves and undermine the foundation of corrupt society. Not heroically, just by sheer persistence.",7,0,2,25 April 2016
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," A Chaffering, Most Farraginous Chronicle.
","I'm giving this a rating of six because I don't know what else to do. It's a complex congeries of ambition and dramatic, innovative whimsy.It's difficult to see how 'Birdman' could possibly become a popular success. The ordinary Hollywood movie has come to the point where its intended audience has a physical age of about fifteen and a mental age buried somewhere farther back in childhood. And this is challenging, more like literature than film.The story itself, as far as it can be discerned through all the fantasy, has Michael Keaton, ex hero of the Birdman movies, and my former supporting player in the magnificent, 'The Squeeze,' now directing a Broadway play, 'What People Talk About When They Talk About Love.' That title might have been too much even for Ingmar Bergman. The rehearsals involve performers like Naomi Watts and the egomaniacal Edward Norton. It's shaping up to be a disaster. But on opening night, everything appears to turn out for the best, and at the climax, for added frisson, Keaton shoots part of his nose off with a real bullet. His hospital room is now filled with flowers. The play is a great success. His wrangles with his ex wife and daughter are now resolved. He's put 'the voices' behind him. He's happy as a clam so he jumps out the window.Keaton does fine by the role of the hallucinating and suicidal director, and everyone else measures up. There's no problem with any of the performances. But, man, this is one heavy duty drama. There's not a giggle in it, not a light moment, no beauty. It may borrow its technique from 'All That Jazz' but it's message is strictly from Willie Loman.You see, whenever Keaton is alone, he's at least free of having to argue with someone or slam somebody up against a wall, but he suffers first from deep-throated voices accusing him of being a phony and so forth. And then the source of the voice appears. It's his former role as Birdman, in the typical panoply of the Action Hero, but with black wings. The figure begins to follow him around the streets of New York, snarling at him behind his back.If you have never seen a Steadycam in use, watch this film because that's about all you'll see. The camera follows, or sometimes precedes, characters as they stalk down long corridors and around corners and up stairs and through doorways. Nothing can stop it. During static scenes, the director displays his fondness for wide angle lenses that turn human faces into those of porpoises.It's a little annoying to mix up hallucinations and fantasies with what's actually going on in the behavior stream. The first time I recall a serious use of the device was in 'I Never Promised You A Rose Garden.' Okay. The hallucinated figures were visible on the screen but we could still tell they weren't real. Then came 'A Brilliant Mind,' far too much of a good thing.And here we have Keaton committing suicide -- I don't know how many times -- before he takes the final fateful leap from the hospital window. When his daughter rushes to the window and sees his smashed body down on the street, she looks up at the sky and smiles. (No, I don't either.) Unless -- unless -- can it be? There IS no road kill below? We don't get to see it. And -- and maybe Keaton really DID take off into the sky like Birdman. In a movie where anything is possible, anything is possible.I leave the judgment to the viewer, blanks, subtitle, and all. You probably won't soon forget it.",6,5,8,13 November 2015
Platoon," A Study in Racial Antagonism
","This is a good movie, and a brave one, for several reasons. The plot and other elements of the film have been covered elsewhere, so I'd like to just make a few comments on the role of race in the Vietnamese conflict.The combat experience in Vietnam was an almost perfect mirror of a famous social psychology experiment by Muzafer Sheriff called, 'The Robbers Cave' study. This may look a little dull but it's important and relevant.Under controlled conditions, Sheriff brought two matched groups of boys to a Boy Scout Camp in the middle of nowhere. In Phase One, the two groups had no contact with one another but gave themselves names (The Eagles and the Rattlers) and lived separately. They developed an intense in-group bonding.In Phase Two, the Eagles and the Rattlers were brought together in competition with one another -- sports and so forth. And each group developed an intense antagonism for the other, an 'us-against-them' set of attitudes. The hostility grew so strong that the experimenters cut Phase Two short so it wouldn't become physically dangerous.In Phase Three, the competitive tasks were removed and replaced by tasks requiring cooperation for the good of both groups together. The crises were artificially created by the experimenters and involved joint jobs like hauling water when the pump broke down, pulling a truck when the engine quit, and so on. The conflict disappeared when it was replaced by what Sheriff called 'a superordinate goal' or 'a superordinate enemy.' The film illustrates the kind of bonding that takes place when the Eagles and the Rattlers are faced with a superordinate enemy, in this story the VC. There's no question that racial identities were retained, but they were overshadowed by allegiance to the group. They had to be, for the sake of survival. The casual and sometimes friendly interaction between African-Americans and whites is even more surprising when you consider that this takes place in the late 1960s, the era of Black Power, the Zebra killings, campus takeovers, and so on. None of that social movement filters into Vietnam. There may or may not be atheists in foxholes, but there seem to be far fewer racists.Enough boring stuff. I mentioned that the film was brave because Stone was the first guy to come out with a film that dealt directly with the ordinary grunts in the Vietnam war. No politics or anything. None of that, 'Why are we here?' business. The war is just a matter of getting through one day after another, shorter and shorter, until you can get out of it.The usual stereotypes are either absent entirely or weak. Nobody is a wise guy from Brooklyn. And there is no braggart from Texas. And Sgt. Elias is not 'good' in contrast to Sgt. Barnes' 'bad' guy. He's a better human being than Barnes, but not a better soldier.Overall, it's an instructive film coming from somebody who was there. And the director doesn't try to drive us nuts with razzle dazzle techniques as he sometimes does in his later work.",8,2,5,1 September 2006
Scream," Retch.
","I guess you could say that this is well done for what it is. The problem is that what it is, is disgusting garbage.Maybe that's a bit harsh. It has some redeeming qualities. There are, for instance, some wisecracks expressive of keen wit. 'Jesus, bring the camera!' 'My name isn't Jesus.' (The old ones are the best, even if they creak a little at the joints.) Also, the pretty Neve Campbell gets to have sex and lose her virginity and yet she still survives the movie. This is an improvement over those slasher flicks in which only the whores gets disarticulated.Also, we can't NOT mention the parody of Edvard Munch's 'The Scream,' which, for Munch, meant something other than laughs. In this movie, one or more maniacs rush around town 'gutting people' and draping their bodies across various facilities. There are a lot of sexual jokes but no nudity. We can't have the teen-aged audience looking at bare bodies, although no one objects to watching them slaughter each other while bathed in blood.It's a self-conscious slasher movie, meaning that Kevin Williamson, the writer, had the bright idea of building a slasher movie filled with clichés around a group of school kids who know that they're in a slasher movie filled with clichés. Whether or not it was intended as self parody, that's how it turns out.The ending involves a couple of maniacs who have decided to follow the dictates of the typical slasher movie, and a hand full of relatively normal people. Every tactic that generates suspense is put to use. A woman gets her hands on a pistol, for instance, but when she tries to shoot the lunatics it doesn't work because the safety is on. The gun is whipped out of her hand and she is belted into unconsciousness, only to rise later, bloodier but smarter.You have never seen so much blood, so many murders, or heard so many screams. There's so much of it that it becomes desemanticized and after a while your involvement becomes more mechanical than emotional. You can't help hoping that Neve Campbell doesn't get the knife stuck through her neck, and that the deranged duo get their just desserts, but it doesn't go beyond wishing for a happy ending. Or any kind of ending at all.",5,1,18,15 May 2012
Prometheus," Why Bother?
","This is a deep movie -- profoundly deep. Or so it seems to believe. Lots of references to Christianity, where did we come from, who created the creatures who created us? Actually, the answer is rather simple. It came from Ridley Scott, the director of 'ALien', and the team of hard-charging MBAs that realized that 'Alien' had made a lot of money and had lasted through an infinity of sequels. This is a kind of chimera -- a mixture of 'Alien' and one of its own later sequels.It's copied and recopied, a thing of shreds and patches. And -- now, this is very important -- it's more expensive and has more impressive visual effects, although they may or may not make sense. Egs., if there was a windstorm on the planet in 'Alien', which was a nice original touch, there is a huge and dangerous sandstorm in 'Prometheus' that could have been copied from Turner's 'Hannibal Crossing the Alps.' If something popped out of somebody's gut -- ditto. Even the musical score echoes Howard Hanson's Romantic Symphony, although it's just hinted at, not quoted outright. We get more of Chopin here, as if classical music can possibly add class to a commercial abomination like this.It's the kind of movie that is so weighty and abstruse that a viewer might get more out of a second viewing of it, if only the first time through hadn't left such a strong feeling that once was enough.The ending sets us up for a sequel. Don't miss it.",3,5,10,6 February 2014
The Water Diviner," Turkish Delight.
","An Australian water diviner, Russell Crowe, loses three sons at Gallipoli in Turkey and after the war travels to the battlefield to retrieve their corpses. I know. It sound lugubrious -- a heavenly choir, the vanquishing of red tape by empathy, as the water diviner divines the skeletons of his sons, one by drawn-out one, and schleps them back home to Australia, mourning and weeping in this valley of tears.Actually, it has plenty of color and dash and it doesn't turn out as expected. Shot in Australia and Turkey, there are some marvelous location shots as we're introduced not just to the battlefield but to Ottoman culture. A stunning shot of the interior of the blue mosque.Among the Ottoman artifacts is Olga Kurylenko. Somewhere, a religious cult should be established in her honor, its symbol her sternoclavicular notch. What a dish. Body by Bernini, neck by Modigliani. Suddenly, that line from 'Dr. Strangelove' -- 'toe to toe with the Russkies' -- doesn't sound like such a bad idea.The romance is subdued, as is Russell Crowe's performance. He's gained weight and lost definition since 'L.A. Confidential' and his bulk now resembles that of John Wayne, a kind of massive heft that his brain orders about. He's quite professional as a director too, fond of overhead shots, but not too fond.The editor should be fired. Sometimes it was easy to get lost. There are flash forwards of whirling dervishes only you don't know they're flash forwards. The whirling dervishes are the decorous public kind, clean and dazed looking, not the Dionysian wild men of the tribal areas. I don't know how they can do it without falling down after the first few minutes.The film is more sympathetic to some of the Turkish soldiers now occupying the battlefield than it is with the British and Australian graves unit. The villains are Greeks, and there are scenes of battle resembling the perforated train sequence in 'Lawrence of Arabia' and one or two echoes of 'Young Churchill.' The bloody combat scenes are disturbing in that they cause you to worry somewhat about just what the solution to the Middle East is.",7,1,2,15 September 2016
Paths of Glory," Kubrick's Most Moving Film.
","It's easy to snare an audience by making a movie about an execution, which is why such movies seem so common -- 'Ted Bundy,' 'I Want to Live', 'The Book of Daniel.' Sometimes the whole story is about the technical aspects of the execution -- 'The Execution of Private Slovick.' It may be easier for an audience to identify with someone about to be executed than it is to identify with someone in a particularized conflict. Should Marlon Brando squeal on his friends and employers in 'On the Waterfront'? Well, yes, but none of us have ever been in Terry Malloy's shoes nor will we ever be, whereas we are all going to face execution some day. In a sense, the audience is gripped and watches with fascinated horror because it's their own deaths taking place on screen.'Paths of Glory' centers around the execution by firing squad of three French soldiers during World War I for cowardice in the face of the enemy. They are picked at random from three companies, on the order of a general (George MacReady) and defended in court by their regimental commander Col. Dax (Kirk Douglas). MacReady blames them, instead of himself, for a failed attack against an impossible German position and wants to set an example for the rest of the French army. 'If those sweethearts won't face German bullets, they'll face FRENCH ones.' And anyway, killing a few of the troops now and again is a boost to their morale.Kubrick takes full advantage of the dramatic elements adumbrating the three deaths. One soldier is simple-minded and desperate, and he turns to religion, blubbering with fear. One is bitter and combative and gets his skull fractured, so he must be propped up unconscious on a stretcher to be shot. The third is frightened but faces his death with dignity.That's about as far as the conventional elements go in this superb movie. Facile clichés are avoided. Here's an example of what I mean. One of the prisoners (Ralph Meeker) has been chosen to die by his company commander (Wayne Morris) because Meeker has seen Morris behave like a drunken, murdering coward on a night patrol. Douglas suspects this, and chooses Morris to head the firing squad. Morris, deeply humiliated and remorseful, offers Meeker a blindfold. Meeker says nothing, just snorts in the negative. Morris mumbles that he's sorry, then leaves. A less original treatment of this incident would have Meeker delivering a speech to the cowardly Morris. 'I may die now but you'll be dying every day for the rest of your life.' (Hey, that's pretty good!) Or maybe, 'Forget it, Lieutenant. You'll be joining me soon enough.' Something like that, anyway. Instead, Meeker neither absolves him nor heaps calumny upon him. Meeker has something more important on his mind than dealing with this quivering moron and his guilt.Well, one more example of what I mean by the avoidance of clichés. The court martial adjourns to consider a verdict. Fade to black. Open with the prisoners being marched to the execution posts. No scene in which everyone sits around biting his fingernails and waiting to hear the verdict. Nobody announces the prisoners have been found guilty and nobody sentences them to death. We don't see MacReady smiling villainously or Douglas looking stunned.I don't want to run out of space so I'll limit this comment to a round of applause for the final scene of anguished French troops getting drunk in a bar, whistling, clapping, pounding on the tables, as a winsome young German girl is brought out by the inn keeper and ordered to sing a song. She begins to sing a German folk song timidly and softly. The soldiers gradually cease their rowdy behavior and listen to her plaintive untrained voice. Except for the pretty girl singing on the stage the bar room becomes utterly still and silent, and then one by one the men begin to hum the little tune along with her. They are all sad and some of them weep. The catharsis is absolutely necessary in a film so filled with tension, anger, and blood.This is Kubrick's most emotional film and shouldn't be missed. His earlier films were good but derivative and his later films devoid of passion. This one hits all the right notes, and the performances are unimpeachable.",9,2,4,16 January 2007
Back to the Future Part II," Time Is Like A River....
","It gets no points for originality because we've visited this particular structure before, but within the limits of the sequel it's inventive, thrilling, suspenseful, and sometimes funny. It's in the nature of sequels to do what has been done successfully before -- only with MORE of it. This one is faster and more packed with incident than 'Back to the Future' and it ends with a brazen advertisement for the sequel yet to come, 'Back to the Future Part III.' Poor Marty McFly is flung about through time again and winds up being transferred from 1988 to 2015, which is three years from this writing. Then he's hauled back to 1955 again and we see repeats and variations on the earlier theme. The villain is still the cretinous Biff and the lightning that strikes the town's clock must be figured into the escape. And we still are treated to McFly playing 'Johnny Be Good' to an astonished audience.It's always interesting to look back at pictures of the future and see what kinds of boats were missed in the predictions. ('The Shape Of Things To Come' is amusing to watch today.) The writers haven't done too much with 2015. The good folks of the town wear some plastic clothes and headgear that looks like space helmets, and there are a few jokes about a Ronald Reagan clone welcoming visitors to 'The 80s Cafe.' The town itself is not transfigured but sports what looks like a pretty and tranquil koi pool in front of the Court House. The MacGuffin is an almanac covering the years 1950 to 2000. If you owned such a document in 1985, McFly's temporal home base, you could do a lot with it.Michael J. Fox is charming in his winsome way and Christopher Lloyd is as loony and manic as ever. Biff is, if anything, more evil than before. He's murderous, demonic. He is defeated, at least for the moment. It remains to be seen if he is or was to turn up as Ike Clanton.",6,1,3,12 June 2012
Carrie," Psychokinesis in extremis.
","Now, it's been said that many of Brian De Palma's movies are sloppy and half-witted imitations of Alfred Hitchcock's. It's a bloody lie. De Palma's movies are very precise and fully witted imitations of Alfred Hitchcock's.Whatever Hitchcock did, Brian De Palma does more of it and does it more expansively.Carrie (Spacek) is a high school senior who is an ugly duckling, kept ignorant by her mother (Laurie) who is a religious fanatic, and ridiculed by her classmates, especially the vicious and vengeful Chris Hargenson (Allen), a juicy and sluttish blond. Kids can be so cruel, you know? Spacek is too freaky to have friends in school but Amy Irving comes closest, and the gym teacher, Miss Collins (Buckley) isn't far behind. Amy Irving goes so far as to persuade her hunky jock/poet inamorato William Katt to take Spacek the Doomed to the all-important senior prom. It's meant as a kindly gesture.There, a terrible trick has been planned for Spacek by Allen and her boyfriend (Travolta). They've take a bucket full of pig's blood, perched it on a beam above the stage mark for the prom queen, arrange it so that Spacek wins, then dump the blood all over her in front of a gym full of classmates and teachers. Katt is knocked out by the falling pail. Everyone begins laughing at Carrie, who is standing wide-eyed with humiliation and fear on the stage, splattered all over with blood.That laughter is a big mistake. Spacek has hidden psychic powers. She distracts everyone from her discredited state by having fire hoses squirt water all over everybody, then electrocuting them and having falling structural beams crush them like cockroaches, and then burning the whole joint down.It's a very carefully done movie, paying at least as much attention to detail as Hitchcock would have, and usually more. Pino Donaggio has contributed a fulsomely orchestrated operatic score. He lifts the screaming violins bodily from 'Psycho.' The cinematography is by Mario Tosi and is equally well done. The performances are fully blown, as is appropriate to an Italian opera. Eyeballs bulge, voices shriek, knives fly through the air, gestures are florid enough to be seen from the balcony.Well, actually, it's not entirely true that this is a precise imitation of Hitchcock. Hitchcock would never have used so many looming close ups. And, like Beethoven, Hitchcock might have adumbrated a big theme into which he was about to launch with a couple of teasers, but he would never have drawn out the tension before a climactic act the way De Palma does.The bucket-of-pig-blood gag seems to go on forever -- and mostly in slow motion, which Hitchcock never used. Have you ever seen a movie in which people clap their hands in slow motion? It's a little like watching a machine gun being fired in slow motion, the twirling cartridges being ejected, the bolt languidly sliding back and forth. It's all very informative but dramatically the impact is more silly than tense.It's different from Hitchcock in other ways too. Hitchcock always made movies about the world he was familiar with. His early movies were about the British working class from which he was sprung. Later we got to see much more of fancy restaurants and Cary Grant in tailored suits. When Hitchcock moved too far from those chummy settings, he tended to stumble, as in 'Under Capricorn' (Australia in an early period). In the end, his social world had narrowed to such an extent that he lost touch with taxi cabs. In his last movie, Bruce Dern is a taxi driver who wears a military-style yellow-cab cap with a bill.I don't mean to go on about Hitchcock this much but any reasonable assessment of 'Carrie' compels me. Hitchcock wouldn't have DREAMED of making a movie about teen-age jealousies and the senior prom. He wouldn't have had sex and nudity in anything he did. He might have allowed the kind of discontinuity in character so blatantly on display here, though.Take Miss Collins, the gym teacher. She's been protective -- even nurturing -- towards the marginalized Carrie. She's punished those who've played tricks on Carrie. She's encouraged her to accept the invitation to the prom, prompted her on her wardrobe and grooming. Miss Collins' eyes glisten with tears when Carrie steps onto the stage to accept the award as prom queen. But a few minutes later, when Carrie is bug-eyed with humiliation, Miss Collins bursts out laughing along with the rest. Why? I guess so she can be selected for the special kind of destruction she gets. It violates the logic of the plot but it makes for startling imagery. And, really, who can believe that Amy Irving would be willing to talk her handsome boy friend into taking another girl to the prom, while Irving stayed home with Mom and Dad? I'd better quit this before I run out of space. I'll have to start editing this nonsense and slashing away at it, 'killing all my darlings,' as Proust would have put it. I wish Brian De Palma could be as ruthless with his work.",6,1,5,31 October 2009
The Queen," Noblesse Oblige.
","This is pretty good, a perceptive and sensitive telling of the Queen's and the public's response to the sudden death of the more or less declassÃ© erstwhile and glamorous Princess Diana.The public goes ape in their mourning. There are terraces of bouquets on the pavement around Buckingham palace. TV is full of Diana -- people weeping, wondering why Queen Elizabeth up there in Scotland, in Balmoral Castle, doesn't come down to London for the funeral, wondering why the flag isn't lowered to half mast.On her part, Helen Mirren as Elizabeth doesn't know what all the fuss is about. After all, Diana is no longer a royal, more of an ex royal, who betrayed the family and spoiled the image of the monarchy. And the flag can't be lowered because it isn't shown in the absence of the Queen, so it's not even raised. Hubby Prince Philip, James Cromwell, a surname to conjure with in the history of British royalty, is openly angry about the whole affair. His chief concern is stalking this big stag that has been roaming the countryside but always keeping just out of rifle range.Alex Jennings is Prince Charles, former husband of Diana, and plays the role as wishy washy and compliant. Other than anguish, it's difficult to know what he's thinking or feeling. Michael Sheen is Tony Blair, the Prime Minister, whose cojones are caught in a vice between the Queen and the public whom he represents. Sheen actually LOOKS like Blair.The story is magnificently played and keenly written. Elizabeth, we learn, drives around the grassy, windswept Scottish glens by herself in a Range Rover. The vehicle stops dead after crossing a stream and the independent monarch determines that it needs to be towed and repaired. (She was a mechanic during the war.) So -- picture this -- the Queen is sitting alone at streamside, waiting grumpily for rescue. She looks up and there, on the other side of the brook is the stately stag, a vision of serenity, indifference, and majesty, a royal unto itself. She stares at it for a minute, then shoos it away before the rescue team arrives.Unfortunately for the stag, it is bagged by a neighboring family. The Queen politely insists on visiting the estate and there hangs the carcass and on a table the noble head with its ornate antlers. The animal had been wounded and tracked for miles before being killed. Elizabeth caresses the furry cheek and mummers something about hoping it didn't suffer too much.Boys and girls, my teacher in the sixth grade, one Miss Velma Spurge, taught us that this was called 'symbolism.' I'd expected something less from this production, an overdramatic, overwrought, overdone, spelling out of every scintillating tabloid detail. But no. It's an adult tale. There are clips of Diana doing what Diana did, speaking openly to reporters about how she was resented by the royal family, speaking out about the many personnel mines left from the many forgotten wars in Africa and elsewhere that are now blowing the legs of children. She was the personification of the three virtues of Greek philosophy; she was honest, she was good, and she was well favored. It's no wonder the public were in love with her. Of course, to Elizabeth, her unsparing candor was irritating and she was an impulsive brat.The Queen gives in to public demand and finally comes to London, perhaps wiser than when she left.",8,0,0,24 January 2016
Raging Bull," Atypical Sports Story
","The usual trajectory in a sports movie involves some underprivileged character discovering he has a talent, being put through a rigorous training by a mentor, riding that talent to national prominence, being undone by personal demons, and finally rediscovering himself. 'Rocky' didn't fit the formula and neither does 'Raging Bull.' 'Rocky,' I suspect, broke the mold not so much in the course of a search for originality but in order to leave the way open for a sequel. Or, as it turns out, about five or six sequels. But 'Raging Bull' dispenses entirely with the formula and follows Jake LaMotta from early in his career to his ultimate degradation as an unfunny host at a seedy bar in New York. And that's it, except for the possibility of a reconciliation between him and his estranged brother, left unresolved.Scorcese's direction is simply fine. It's identifiably his own, of course, with inserts of home movies, fist fights over girls, an edgy semi-improvisational quality in the delivery of dialog, slow motion punches to the mouth, a musical score that leans heavily on Italian opera and contemporary pop songs. The plot, for whatever reason, doesn't integrate too well its chief themes -- LaMotta's obsession with his wife's fidelity and his career in the ring. You could almost eliminate one of the plot strings and have enough left over for an independent feature. But that's a minor carp in the overall context because the overwhelming presence of Robert DeNiro as Jake LaMotta pretty much manages to pull them together so the seams are not noticeable.So the movie depends on DeNiro's performance -- and does he deliver! In real life DeNiro is a sensitive, thoughtful, and private guy, but he does a superb job of dumbing his character down and making him sympathetic and ugly at the same time. Let's say that his LaMotta doesn't show a great deal of insight, whether running around in a paranoid frenzy or pounding an enemy into pulp in the ring. And he has one scene that equals anything he's put on the screen before. A down-and-outer, arrested for serving minors in his cheap night club, and thrown in jail because he is unable to raise a few thousand dollars for bail, he repeatedly smashes his fists against the wall and pounds his forehead on the cement, all the while ululating like a wounded animal. What a performance.He's well supported by Joe Pesci as the brother who is no more insightful but at least has a hold on common sense. Cathy Moriarty is adequate as LaMotta's abused wife.I'm driven to add something completely irrelevant to an assessment of the film. When it first came out, I was part of a seminar in the Psychiatry Department at the University of Connecticut and we were dealing with delirium, derived from Latin 'de liro' -- 'I rave.' I desperately wanted to somehow sneak into the discussions a play on words involving the title of the film -- 'Raving Bull' staring Robert DeLiro. I never found a way of bringing it up without appearing nuts. Now I've got it out of my system, thanks to IMDb.com, after a quarter of a century. Pardon me. (Wiping away tears of relief and gratitude.) I'd like to thank you all for reading this. I owe everything I have to my coach (thanks, Butch) and my Mom and Dad. (Sob.) Much of the credit goes to my cat, Josefina, and to my Mousterian ancestors. (Breaking into a lachrymose cascade.) This is a violent and sometimes bloody movie. Scorcese spares us nothing in the way of physical or emotional brutality. But it really shouldn't be missed. A good job on the part of everyone concerned.",7,9,17,29 January 2007
Taken 2," Painful.
","It somehow seems perfectly apt that the director of this piece of commercial garbage should be called Oliver Megaton. If the name didn't exist it would have to be invented for pile drivers like this.In 'Taken', Liam Neeson, ex Everything, saves his young daughter after she's been kidnapped by greaseballs who want to sell her into white slavery in Paris -- or something like that. He wipes them all out.Now, the problem is that the villains, all dead, can not be brought back for a sequel. What to do, what to do. Okay. I've got it. The Arab heavies must have a family, right? And, as we all know, them Arab camel drivers are all tribal and everything so we'll have the pater familias seek revenge. An eye for an eye, said Hammurabi, also a camel driver. And who's to object? Everybody has long forgotten George W. Bush's announcement that 'we are not at war with Islam.' We ARE at war with Islam! Kill 'em all and let God sort 'em out. They're not good for anything except oil and falafels.We can almost hear the slight whir of well-practiced gear wheels in the Hollywood studios. For a brief period it was the South American cartels. For an equally brief interval it was the Albanians because who the hell knows where Albania is? The MBAs in Hollywood must yearn for the good old days of fat, bald Nazi sadists and fat, bald Cold War slobs, although they WILL regress from time to time. Both 'Air Force One' and the dismal 'Crimson Tide' pinned the Russians to the wall -- but splinter groups! The blockbuster 'Die Hard' had a German gang but some of them spoke Russian. The executives couldn't make up their minds which was the better villain. In psychology this is known as an approach/approach conflict.I've kind of skipped the plot because it's an hour-and-a-half burden of meretricious crap. You've seen it all before -- the car chases, the lightning-fast karate blows, the gun skittering along the floor, the horrible deaths of broken necks, shattered bodies, and blood-splattered walls. The climax is emblematic. Neeson is holding a pistol against the head of the last villain, the most important, the old man whose family was decimated. Neeson offers to put the gun down if the old chap will give his word that the vendetta is now at an end. The old man gives his word. Neeson put down the gun and turns to leave. The old man picks up the gun, aims it at Neeson's back, and pulls the trigger. Click. The Baba should have seen that coming. I guess they don't get out to the movies much.Of course, Liam Neeson, whom I like a lot, is an unpretentious actor and has a remarkably endearing nose. He hulks his way through this paranoid fantasy with no martial arts skills but with a seasoned editor who knows how to make it look as if Neeson did have them.Nice scenery -- shot in Istanbul.If you enjoy being tied up and mistreated while wearing a black leather mask and having a red rubber ball strapped in your mouth -- which is okay by me, you know, a chacun à son goût -- then you'll go through an autonomic spasm while watching this. Otherwise, spend your time more constructively.",2,1,1,14 March 2015
The Silence of the Lambs," Surprisingly Effective Thriller
","Jodie Foster, in a fine performance, is FBI-trainee Clarice Starling. She is assigned by the chief of the Behavioral Sciences Division (Scott Glenn) to interview the brilliant and cannibalistic mad psychiatrist Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins) in prison and try to enlist his help in capturing a currently active serial murderer, Buffalo Bill (Ted Levine), who skins his victims and sews the patches of skin into a kind of integumental suit made of women.When Starling first visits Lecter, the chief psychiatrist ( the eminently hatable Anthony Heald) escorts her down into the bowels of the institution and cautions her about approaching Lecter too closely, although they will be separated by a wall of bullet-proof plastic.Lecter DOES in fact help her. Buffalo Bill had once been a patient of his. But Lecter wants something too, in return. 'Quid pro quo,' he tells her, showing off his Latin clichés. For every hint he gives to her and to the FBI, he demands some sort of present, such as a room with a view and, most important, some personal details about Starling's earlier life, the events in her past that brought her from a one-horse town in Appalachia to the FBI. He gets it. And she gets Buffalo Bill. And Lecter escapes in order to carry on his own cannibalistic career, beginning with the eminently hatable Anthony Heald. (His last line: 'I'm having an old friend for dinner tonight.') It doesn't sound too promising, does it? Still ANOTHER serial killer on the loose? With a puzzling modus operandi? Which the FBI must figure out in order to track him down and shoot him dead? But I described this as an effective thriller, not an ordinary one that serves as one more opportunity for Stallone to strip off his clothes and bulge his muscles at the camera. It's functionally directed by Jonathan Demme, based on Thomas Harris's novel. Only one incident involves a stunt man. There isn't a car chase in sight, nor an exploding fireball, nor a slow-motion shot of violence. There is one lethal beating and only a single shoot-out -- with pistols, not Uzis or 40 mm. Bofors cannons.The three threads of the story involve Glenn's avuncular relationship with the younger Starling, the flirtation (for that's what it amounts to) between Lecter and Starling, and the pursuit of the twisted Buffalo Bill. The stories mesh very well, and one scene in particular, linking the FBI's attack on a suspect's house to Starling's casual and apparently post-climactic ringing the doorbell of a house belonging to an old lady, is masterfully done.Tak Fujimoto's camera work could hardly be improved upon. He paints for us a wintry Middle-Atlantic setting with ice-cold rivers and stark, bare deciduous trees. There is a scene with a decomposing corpse that makes your skin crawl, although it is handled matter-of-factly, or even in such good taste as such a scene allows for. Original, too, is the character of Buffalo Bill's last intended victim, a large young lady kept prisoner in a basement pit. With Bill still darting around in the shadows somewhere, the lone Starling yells down to her and tells her she's safe now that the FBI is here. We're wrong if we expect the captive to pull the usual response. She doesn't break down and sob with relief. She screams back, '**** that, you b****! Get me out of here!' It was a nice touch in the novel too, which is written in lean, functional, and artless prose.All of the performances are quite good, with Hopkins outstanding as the crazy genius. The character became something of an icon in vernacular culture, which I guess is why audiences find it satisfying and amusing that he should be left on the loose to kill still more people. It adds a new dimension to films -- the serial killer who deserves to be let free because he's polite and has visited Florence. The writers help bring this story above average. When Foster explores the house of an earlier, almost forgotten victim, there is a touching moment when she discovers some hidden photos the girl had taken of herself posing coyly in her underwear, although she's too plump to be conventionally attractive. A music box plays in the background while Foster goes through these pitiful remnants and we can sense the life behind the death. The direction isn't free of conventions though. Foster is blinded in darkness and the murder's hand reaches out from behind the camera and traces her contours without touching them. Every horror movie must have such a scene. And earlier, when Scott Glenn realizes he's sent Foster into a dangerous, potentially lethal circumstance without any warning, the camera moves in quickly to a close up of his startled expression as he says, 'Clarice!' These clichés are available in finer B-grade slasher movies everywhere.The conventions are aptly deployed though and the movie succeeds in what it's trying to do.",7,2,7,15 February 2008
Vanilla Sky," Sleeper
","SPOILERS.All of the movie is, like Gaul, divided into three parts.  (1) Handsome, young, wealthy, powerful Tom Cruise crosses his blonde temporary squeeze and takes up with a darker more viable squeeze.  In doing so he betrays his friend.  He's also involved in a tug of war with the board of directors for control of his company.  A love story.  (2)  Handsome etc. Cruise is involved in an accident in which his face is disfigured and he degrades himself by being drunk and hiding from the world and engaging in first-degree self pity.  Strange things begin happening to him because of the various metal items in his partially reconstructed face.  (3)  There follows the unraveling of a mystery in a sci fi setting, rather like 'Total Recall.'You have to feel sorry for the hero.  I mean here he is, in all his Tom Cruiseness, stalked by a blonde (with whom he can make love four times in one night yet).  It doesn't help that the rejected stalker is played by the stultifyingly charming and beautiful Cameron Diaz.  You can tell this is a guy who's used to getting what he wants -- and exactly what he wants. The other babe is no slouch either.  It's Penelope Cruz in long, silky black hair, with an enchanting mole on her sternum, a voice like a non-smoking Victoria Golena, and a striking elfin presence, along the lines of Maria Bartiromo.  He deserves to get his face smashed, just for having it so good!He's kind of his usual cocky self at the beginning, and why shouldn't he be cocky?  He can not only pick between blonde and brunette but he can hump his best friend and not feel guilty too.  But then things begin to get a little twisted.  His face is so banged up that his appeal is called into question. We begin to wonder if this is going to turn into another one of those movies in which a disabled person has to learn to overcome his disability or at least his feelings of self disgust.  Then things get even more twisted. He's goes to bed with Penelope and wakes up to find Cameron next to him. (Either way would be okay for most of us.  Both of them together and all men could make love four times a night, or even five or ten.)  He's cured of that disfigured visage.  But then he looks in a mirror and it's back! When he's in a bar with his best friend and the guy jokes that his newly renewed face is splitting a seam, we're as scared as Cruise.  There's another scene in a bar later in which some guy with a Brit accent informs Cruise that everything happening to him is his own invention, that he can make anyone do whatever he wants.  Cruise shouts that all he wants right now is for everyone to shut up.  They obligingly do so.  Is he on acid?  Is he nuts. Is he going through something like the guy who was hanged at Owl Creek Bridge?  What's up?  There has so far been a kind of framing story in which Cruise, wearing a regnerative prosthetic mask, is trying to figure this all out with a psychologist in prison.  It seems he, Cruise, has murdered someone.  Fragments of the act return.  Yes, he murders Cameron, but no, it's Penelope, as we can tell from that succulent nevis on her chest.Well, folks, the ending will clear things up for you.  But, I must say, the resolution sits kind of uncomfortably on top of what's gone on before, incongruously, like a fool's cap on a seal's head.  It's pretty much out of the Twilight Zone.  By this time the viewer is as delirious as the hero. But that's not quite the right word.  Delirious is from de liro -- 'I rave' -- but what we have here is dreaming, not raving, even though the dream is supposed to be pleasant instead of warped into a nightmare by the guilt Cruise carries around in his subconscious.It's an interesting movie if you can accept the disjointed plot and get past those somewhat grinding shifts of gear.  The acting could hardly be improved on.  Cameron Diaz has the face, and the ability, to switch from helpless devotion to something more sinister.  I've only seen one other film with Penelope Cruz, a quite different part, but she is immensely appealing here, always cheerfully in control of what's going on around her, knowledgeable beyond any expectable point about herself and the people around her. She's fine.  And Tom Cruise has never given a better performance.  As an actor maybe he has a tendency to smile and laugh too much.  In this case, his smiles and laughter assume heavily ironic tones.  There is a scene in which Diaz tries to talk him into taking a ride with her, just after he's left Cruz's apartment.  It gives him a chance to display his range as a performer and he handles it very well.  When Diaz first calls to him that smirky grin appears and he says, 'You're following me.'  Her entreaties become more serious and personal, and watch his expression and hear his voice change to one that suggests -- not exactly personal injury -- but the closing of a door.The direction is well done too, considering the challenges that needed to be met to put such a story line across.  And the photography is outstanding. Vanilla skies indeed.I recommend seeing this, but fasten your seatbelts.  It's not a conventional love story, a conventional self-discovery movie, a conventional mystery, or a conventional science fiction story, although it's a little of all of these.",Null,0,1,1 March 2003
Fifty Shades of Grey," Soft Porn.
","It would be nice if parents stopped naming their little girls Dakota. As it stands, we're going to have an entire generation of women named Dakota. This particular Dakota is rather good, as far as it's possible to tell from her performance here as the young woman so much in love that she puts up with all sorts of bondage until she finally cries 'Enough!' and the affair ends.She's an attractive woman but not TOO attractive. Rather pleasant looking, with big blue appealing eyes. Her figure is feminine and ordinary. She's the kind of woman men might find themselves staring at in a supermarket without quite understanding why.And she handles the role well. She's a virgin, her voice a tentative, slightly breathless whine. She has a menial job -- sales lady in a hardware shop -- like Sylvester Stallone's girl friend in 'Rocky.' And she accidentally runs into Jamie Dornan, a young, strapping, handsome, commanding presence who is filthy rich and courts her in a way every girl seems to dream of being courted. At least I guess so, because the pattern crops up so commonly, as in 'Pretty Woman.' From the beginning it was clear that this story was shaped by women, two of them in fact -- E. L. James and Kelly Marcel. If it had opened with an outrageous burst of violence, somebody's brains splattered on the wall, I'd figure a testosterone-ridden man was behind it all.Jamie Dornan is a big nuisance. He stares fixedly. He only blinked twice, I counted. He never smiles. He issues orders. He seems to know everything, or thinks he does. And he's got the dough to back it all up. 'Come with me,' he orders, and, poof, we're doing snap rolls in a sailplane. 'Don't fall in love with me,' he advises her sternly, so she falls in love with him.After the ritual deflowering comes the S&M but only its frisson. He never does anything very serious to her, just tickling her with a feathery lash while she's bound hand and foot. I don't know why this was painted as so scandalous. Far more can be found in other films, like 'Nine Weeks' or 'Nine Songs,' though you have to be ready for that last one.Bondage and cheap love stories not being very interesting as far as I'm concerned, I thought the movie was lousy. You want it to have some emotional impact? Don't just cast the female lead as a wimp. Cast her as an overweight wimp. Or a menopausal wimp. Any normal man would like to pinch and bite Dakota Johnson. That's too easy, a sell out.If you must have a dominant/subordinate relationship in which the woman participates, try 'Secretary,' a much better film, even without nudity.",4,2,6,21 November 2015
Tombstone," A Confederacy of Mustaches
","Sometimes I wish Sergio Leone had never made any of those much-imitated Westerns. We'd be spared all those close up of faces of the sort were get here. Sometimes, instead of a choker, we find some kind of macrolens that gives us ever fleck in the subjects irises and every pore on his nose. Sometimes if a character should smile, there is a Great Wall as the screen is filled with giant Chiclets.There's that aplenty in this movie. And lots of gunplay too. Sometimes I was confused about who, exactly, was shooting whom, and why. Why, for instance, does the gang led by Michael Rooker, genuine bad guys so far, revolt against Powers Booth? Okay. Booth has been responsible for a couple of shotgun blasts thrown womensward. That's enough to turn off anyone who reeks of sensibilities the way these boys do. But why does Rooker and his gang then throw in with the Earp faction? Motivation is thrown to the winds, along with the red scarves the reformed bad guys have been wearing.I suppose the story of the Earps, Doc Holliday, and the Clantons is familiar in rough outline to everyone, so there's no need to recount it. The historical inaccuracies aren't particularly bothersome. The movie doesn't pretend to be a documentary and it's not trying to make some sociopolitical point that needs propping up by evidence.But, maybe because I missed a few minutes here and there, the movie struck me as a kind of sloppy lash-up. Were the cutters drinking an infusion of mushrooms or what? The story is all over the place. Okay -- Wyatt Earp is married to a hop head. What happens to their marriage? It just sort of fades away and Wyatt runs off with the red-headed singer.Speaking of red-haired singers, I really like Dana Delaney, but she's miscast here as a free spirit, a saloon girl, squired around by the County Sheriff. No. She's beautiful, but not in the properly sluttish way. She has great big dark soulful eyes and a tiny dimpled smile, in which her lower lip covers much of her upper lip. This woman is not an iconoclast. She is reassuringly feminine stability. And she's the only woman we get to know much about. Doc Holliday (Val Kilmer) has a girl too, the exotically gorgeous Joanna Pacula, but she fades away too. The Earp's wives were almost indistinguishable to me.There are two interesting figures. One is Curly Bill, played by Powers Booth. He's neat in his red shirt. He laughs with genuine pleasure as he rips things apart and shoots out lights and he has never regretted anything in his life, a regular Edith Piaf in drag. He's the kind of guy who, after having accidentally shot a harmless well-intentioned old sheriff through the heart, doesn't seem remorseful, just puzzled. 'Aww, come on White,' he says drunkenly, as if Sheriff White were playing a game that had gone too far. I hated to see Booth go.The other interesting figure is the tragic Doc Holliday, all pale and sweaty and coughing blood from consumption. I understand he was a kind of rotten guy in real life, a racist and all that, but he's a winning character here. He talks like a college graduate. 'Frederic f***ing Chopin.' And he will not use a short word where a long one will fit in. But we are thankfully spared any display of his medical skills. The script doesn't even get into his background enough to establish him as a dentists -- let alone a surgeon.Holliday was a surgeon in 'My Darling Clementine,' come to think of it, which had far more in the way of historical inaccuracies. But you know what? It's a far far better movie than 'Tombstone.' There's nothing here that even remotely resembles Wyatt Earp escorting Clementine to the church service.This is okay if you're interested in lots of gunplay and not much in the way of character or humor. The photography is quite good. An item in 'trivia' says the lightning was real lightning, and it looks it, but curiously the thunder sounds electronic, less real than the thunder of half a century ago. Nice silhouettes of funeral processions under a darkening sky. But the cinematography doesn't really save the movie from mediocrity.What led to all that violence in the Southwest was honor. Honor was a vital part of the regional Southern culture and the Western culture that sprang from it. Honor is like water. We need it, just as we need a drink once in a while. But there can be too much of it and what you wind up with is a flood that destroys communities even as it preserves dignity. Robert E. Lee had to be careful about posting his officers in the Civil War. There were so many outstanding challenges to duels that he had to be sure to keep those offended far apart.",5,10,22,25 December 2004
Blade Runner," Sean Young: Basic Pleasure Model.
","Nice romantic, futuristic score by Vangelis and the production design is stunning. But, like salad dressing, it ought to have something worthwhile to go on. I realize this film has a big following and is extremely popular in some circles but I was unable to get with it.No complaints about the performances or casting. Take Sean Young. If you took a talented sculptor, asked him to close his eyes for a few minutes and dream up the most beautiful woman imaginable, he might come up with someone with Sean Young's features. Well, throw in her unimpeachable body too. You'd have to instruct the sculptor carefully though. None of this 'interesting' business, just plain gorgeous, get it? Forget the Mona Lisa or Eakins' wife. Think Betty and Veronica.You can't sculpt acting talent, lamentably, but in this case it doesn't matter. Anything low normal or above will do. Sean Young is all glossed up in a hyper-Hollywood manner. Her eyes carefully darkened, her lips a deep and shiny cherry red. Even bald, she looks just fine.Obviously a lot of effort and imagination have gone into this movie, but what, really, is it all about? A government hit man is hired to find and terminate half a dozen evidently violent robots who are developing human traits. But, suppose the hit man, Harrison Ford, and the object of his intentions, Sean Young, feel attracted towards one another? These robots appear to eat and do commit other acts of biological interest although why that was programmed into them is problematic. Interesting question that has been raised often before.In any case, when the broth is reduced, it's a pretty slow movie. Some suspense and a good deal of romance. I didn't get much out of it, didn't really care about the characters, but don't want to advise anyone to avoid it. If you peaked on Scale 8 of the original Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory. Or -- well, you'd have to go to a lot of trouble to find that out. So, to save time, just ask yourself if you have any faith in astrology. If yes, see this flick.",5,2,13,10 October 2009
Mr. Holland's Opus," Won't You Come Home, George Bailey?
","Spoilers.  What saves this movie is Richard Dreyfus' performance and the delicious tightening of the screws as the sentimentality increases.  The plot isn't novel.  We've seen 'It's a Wonderful Life' a thousand times. Then there are the several versions of 'Good-bye, Mister Chips.'  Surely other versions that I can't remember of the guy/woman who finds himself/herself in a job that seems unrewarding, then, after a lifetime of attempted escapes, seems finally rejected by the system he's resented, like a ship deserting a sinking rat.  But no!  The man/woman has had more of a benificent influence than he/she has thought.  And this despite the tribulations of deaf children (in this case), alcoholism, existential despair, mismanaged marriages, mental illness, or crippling dandruff.  At the end all of his friends and supporters gather in a final handkerchief-drenching salute.It's a little difficult to imagine Richard Dreyfus exercising self restraint but he does it here, and very effectively.  The plot developments are almost entirely predictable.  The student who can't play the clarinet winds up governor.  The one who can't play the drums is lost in Vietnam.  (The film covers 30 years.)  The gorgeous young senior who falls in love with him becomes a stage success.  Through it all, Dreyfus plays, not Dreyfus, but Mr. Holland.  He's quite good.  And he gets ample support from people like Bill Macy and Olympia Dukakis.A secondary plot has him in a kind of love/hate relationship with his hearing-challenged son, Cole.  What a disappointment for a music teacher and composer.  How sharper than a serpent's tooth it is to have a child who's deaf.  (The script writers went overboard on irony here.)  When John Lennnon is murdered, Dreyfus has a big silent fight with Cole, who protests that he too feels Lennon's loss, although his old man gives him no credit for it. This is resolved when Dreyfus realizes how wrong he's been, and at a tribute for the murdered ex-Beatle sings Lennon's simple, touching song, 'Beautiful Boy.'  He alters the last line of the lyric, so that it becomes, 'Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful, beautiful -- Cole.'  Not being morons, the audience could have done without that change.But no matter.  It's an above-average uplifting story.  Every time the bell rings an angel gets his wings, you know.  The only problem I have is that, what lingers most tellingly, is not the one and only performance of Mr. Holland's composition, but his reply to a friend who offers to help however he can, now that Mr. Holland is fired for budgetary reasons, perhaps a letter of reference.  Dreyfus says, 'I'm sixty years old.  Who are you going to write a letter of reference to -- the morgue?'  I hope he enjoyed conducting his opus.",Null,3,6,1 December 2002
Ben-Hur," Pomp and Circumstance.
","It's a long film about Judah Ben-Hur and his family, betrayed by their former Roman friend, Messala. Heston is Ben-Hur and Stephen Boyd is Messala. Their mutual enmity animates most of the picture. A combination of luck and skill raises Heston from slavery to the higher echelons of Roman governance, an opportunity he spurns because he has grown to hate Roman civilization. Christ has a featured bit part, whose voice, as Heston says at the end, 'has taken the sword from my hand.'This is an epic movie by any definition. No expense must have been spared. And the chariot race in the Circus Maximus is without peer. Heston seems to fit into togas and caftans well. He's an impressive presence on the screen. Stephen Boyd as the unregenerate villain doesn't have as much to do but his death scene probably represents his best moments on the screen. He puts everything he has into it and it comes out right. Hugh Griffith is the wily Arab sheik and, as usual, there's always something slightly comic in his pop-eyed performances.The director was William Wyler, a competent professional who brought some surprising sense of cynicism and outrage to Jimmy Stewart's post-war Westerns. Here, he catches small details of life under the Romans that are usually ignored in the sword-and-sandal epics of the 1950s, the ones with title like 'Hercules Versus the Gorgon.' I'd never known before that the slaves manning the oars of the Roman triremes had to be trained to row at three speeds -- regular, battle, attack, and ramming. Whew. Heston and the rest of the rowers are palpably exhausted after a spell of ramming speed.And before the chariot race, we see footmen or whatever they are, disentangling the gathering horses from one another and dislodging chariot wheels that have gotten themselves stuck in some mural nook. When a charioteer has an accident during the race, they run out rescue him and carry him off on stretchers before the vehicles appear around the bend again. Nice perceptive touches but done conventionally and without distinction. There is a longish scene in the sheik's test, when Griffith fondles his horses and Cheston forces himself to burp. It's an interesting scene, but in 'Lawrence of Arabia,' there was a similar scene in a vast Arab tent and David Lean had the actors pause while a strong breeze made the tent poles creak slightly. Here, the tent isn't alive. It's just a dead tent.In the end, no Jews are actually converted to Christianity, which didn't exist yet anyway. But all the principals speak with hushed awe about Christ's sermon the mount. I kept wondering if the Haifa-born Haya Harareet had any difficulty with the role.As it develops, the thrilling chariot race is ante-climactic. Long after it's over and Messala's death is forgotten, we have to endure Christ's suffering and crucifixion. Of course, he was the original charismatic personality, yet it's always a downer to see someone tortured and killed.With just a few tweaks, it might have been changed to one of those anti-Nazi movies of the 40s and 50s. The Romans are racists, persecuting the Jews and other misfits, ridiculing the Arabs, torturing prisoners, consigning the sick to the valley of lepers, shown as a kind of concentration camp. Jack Hawkins is magnificent as the Good German.It's an important movie if only because of its sprawling narrative, it's quotidian details, and that unforgettable chariot race. A viewer can only imagine how today's CGI experts would dump the stunt men like 'Breezy' Easton and fill the screen with dismembered bodies, flying arms and legs, and chariots tumbling directly into the camera. In 1959, there were no such techniques available -- a near miss. But I suppose it's only a matter of time before a new version of this chestnut is released.",7,0,3,25 April 2015
Casino Royale," Bond Beds Babes, Sinks Buildings!
","This is James Bond straight, for a change. The original series, begun in the early 1960s, was a big and inexpensive hit. A lot of trend setters were reading Ian Fleming -- President Kennedy was a fan -- and Fleming's stories made mincemeat out of the Cold War. SMERSH? And the young Sean Connery was the perfect screen incarnation of Bond, a parody of handsome masculinity -- and a knowing one -- with that cartoonishly broad mouth, that tongue-in-cheek smirk, and the throw-away wisecracks the script gave him.The series may have been the initial stimulus for the rash of increasingly silly action films that followed. The series itself seemed swallowed up by them in the 1980s but soldiered on anyway, though I can't imagine who was anxious to see them.This one takes Bond seriously. The jokes are few. Although the formula is overly familiar, it's clear that a lot of money was spent on this attempt to breathe new life into a dead horse. (These mixed clichés do full justice to the film.) In the opening scene, Bond chases a villain through an industrial construction site in Madagascar. The pair climb innumerable staircases of latticed steel before coming mano a mano at the end of a sky-high giant crane, after which they leap from the top of one building to the top of the next one lower down, until they reach the ground and somebody pulls a gun and -- well, the blanks can be filled in at leisure. Since there is no more USSR, the heavies are now some camarilla of terrorists, not that it matters. Spectacular stunt work, by the way. In the final action sequence, James Bond sinks a building on the Grand Canal in Venice with a few well-placed pistol shots. (The building floats on pontoons.) The action is interrupted by some short scenes of intrigue, a card game with a pot of $130 million that today, given the dollar's trajectory, is worth about half that much. Bond's chief opponent in the game is Le Chiffre (Mad Mikkelsen) who has a face and expression resembling that of a freshly stuffed and painted corpse. Daniel Craig is Bond himself. He's at least not ludicrously handsome though heavily muscled. Whether he can act or not can't be determined because evidently he was told not to try. Eva Greene, on the other hand, is magnificently glamorized. She could steal my $130 million any day, though I wouldn't let her near my Swedish Kroner. A dirty shame she has to drown at the end, despite her perfidy, inasmuch as we haven't yet had a chance to see her nude. We'll have to rely on our memories of Bertolucci's 'The Dreamers' for that.Should you see it? Sure, why not? There hasn't been an expensive, colorful, exotic action movie in at least a year. There was an earlier version of 'Casino Royale', in 1967, I think. It was a headlong, feckless, comic spoof. I enjoyed it more than this version.",6,2,6,6 April 2008
Bull Durham," Low Key Romantic Comedy
","I've done my best to like this over the years because a number of people whose opinions I respect have recommended it. I can see why. I mean, here is it -- 1988. And what has been showing up on the screen? Rambo, Bruce Willis, Ahnold, Freddy Kruger, Pumpkin Head, Batman, the guy with the hockey mask and the butcher knife, Lund Dolfgren, Chuck Norris saving the US from the North Vietnamese, Jamie Lee Curtis screaming while monsters slaughter her slutty friends, Piranha, Jaws, Jaws II, Bruce Loses His Cherry, and -- well, I don't know what all.And here, in the middle of all this garbage, comes 'Bull Durham,' a leisurely examination of non-stereotypical people in a milieu (minor league baseball) that no one knows or cares about. The story itself isn't much we haven't seen before, but the characters are anything but formulaic.Tim Robbins is new to the Durham Bulls. He pitches fast balls with a great deal of 'heat' but he's wild and easily distracted. Kevin Costner is the newly arrived catcher, recently sent down from the major leagues, who has a thing or two to tell Robbins. They are also in competition for the heart and body of Susan Sarandon, a kind of local baseball groupie who schtupps the best player of the season and is always true to him in her fashion. She has a degree from Alliance Junior College, has New Age tendencies, and quotes from Blake, Whitman, and a number of other wordsmiths. There are a number of sexy scenes. The romantic and the athletic competition exist in equipoise.As you can see, it's not exactly what you'd expect in a movie about baseball or any other sport. It has a certain charm, but very low in key, rather like some unexpected and interesting rock formation you stumbled across on the Appalachian trail. You're compelled to stop and admire the thing for a while.It was written and directed by Ron Shelton, who has convinced me he knows baseball, or at least has invented a colorful argot for it. It must have been successful because it spawned a number of cruder imitations, funnier but with considerably less of its fey quality. In the rip offs, the characters are no longer quirky. They're bizarre. I have in mind especially 'Minor League.' The template may have originated with 'Semi-Tough,' back in 1977. But the 1970s were a good decade for movies, whereas 1988 was part of a decade in which the screen swam in schlock. So, Shelton, good on you, and good on the angels who provided the dough.",7,0,0,14 July 2010
Signs," They're Here -- Yet Again
","I expected this to be one of those special f/x schlock fests with people running around, screaming hysterically, amidst dazzling fireworks, but it wasn't that at all.  Instead, everything began quietly, deliberately, ominously.  The eponymous signs are crop circles, the first signals that something is up world-wide.  Not too promising a beginning, since the circles were debunked years ago.  But the nicely evoked rural atmosphere of Bucks County, Pennsylvania, was charming in the same way that rural Iowa was charming in 'Field of Dreams.'  (Bucks County is now being devoured from the north by Allentown and engulfed from the south by Philadelphia and will shortly resemble every other mall-blighted area in the country.)  And, then, too, I was kind of impressed by the overall tone imposed on the flick by its director.  Everyone speaks slowly and quietly, often actually whispering, although there is no reason to whisper.  It looked as if it might be an unorthodox, thoughtful look at the nature of the universe, or at least our perceptions of it.Then, alas, the blocks began to fall into place and what we have instead is a kind of Steven King horror story skeleton fleshed out with techniques derived from the X Files.  Mel Gibson, in a decent performance, is a clergyman who has lost his faith after his wife's death and turned to farming.  I hoped against hope he wouldn't recover his belief in God after undergoing some additional crisis.  Phoenix is his failed baseball-player brother who doesn't have much to do except help out around the house, doing such chores as whacking aliens with his baseball bat and accidentally smashing the only light bulb in the cellar when they need it most.  The two kids, however, are engagingly underplayed and the little girl is given some funny lines.  (Although nobody laughs, or even grins at any time in the movie.)  Gibson too has a comic moment when the family votes on whether to leave the house or stay and hole up there.  When he is outvoted, he abruptly claims to have 'two votes' because he represents two parents.  The boy gets angrily to his feet and says, 'That's bull****.'  Well -- it's funny in the context of this rather grim flick anyway.  The plot has just about every cliche you can think of.  Does the reverend regain his faith?  Actually, it's not clear whether he does or not.  Are there awed newscasters on TV reporting crop circles and lights in the sky from all around the world, saying things like, 'God help us all'?  Is there a sick kid who, in order to survive, must have medicine that has been left behind in a place of danger and must be retrieved?  Is the family trapped in the cellar, as in 'Night of the Living Dead'?  Do they spend half the movie fumbling around in the dark with only two flashlights between them, as in The X Files?  Is the house hastily boarded up with planks nailed over the windows and doors, as in 'The Birds'?  Do the aliens try to creep into the house through neglected openings such as a coal shoot, as in 'Close Encounters of the Third Kind'?  Are they finally defeated by something found all around us in everyday life, like harmless bacteria ('The War of the Worlds') or water ('The Day of the Triffids,' 'The Wizard of Oz')?  The answers are yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, and yes.Still, I admire the attempt on the part of the people responsible for this flick, the director in particular, to breathe some life into these moribund elements of the plot.  At least they tried.",Null,1,4,12 July 2003
Saving Mr. Banks," Picking The Bones.
","Well, did Walt Disney (Hanks) have a tough time convincing Mrs. Travers (Thompson) that she should allow him to turn her book, 'Mary Poppins', into a musical, or what.Emma Thompson is one cranky, uptight, insulting lady. The actress isn't bad looking in any way but make up has done a splendid job of deglamorizing her -- those close-cut curls, that thin red scar of a frowning mouth. I don't know why old Walt flew her from England to Anaheim in the first place. Nobody would get within ten feet of her because it might be catching. What a snot she is.Walt, on the other hand, is all Middle America. (Everybody calls him 'Walt', never 'Mister Disney.') He certainly knows how to please people. I always enjoy rides on his Pirates of the Caribbean and The Haunted Mansion. Sometimes I get a kick out of The Flight of Mister Toad or whatever it is, but I don't like to admit it. Walt always has a big smile. He's full of Mid-Western common sense. He's willing to give a little. And Mrs. Travers calls Disneyland a 'big money-printing machine.' That's the kind of lady SHE is.She fights him all the way, far beyond the point at which we simple humans would have given up. But he woos her, flying to England after she flees Los Angeles, and doing a psychodynamic number of her. Look, Mrs. Travers, both of us have had difficult and sometimes tragic childhoods, but there's no reason to go on living out that tragedy. You've created a story that brightens peoples' lives and I'm a story teller. You see, we have a lot in common. She's seduced.Both the principals handle their roles with professional aplomb. Emma Thompson in particular is a fine actress. But the director, John Lee Hancock, has over-directed some of the supporting cast. If they show surprise, they don't do it the way you and I would. Instead, their jaws must practically drop to the floor.There are multiple flashbacks to Mrs. Travers' life as a young girl in Australia. The pattern of dysfunction was cribbed from 'A Tree Grows in Brooklyn' -- the sober, practical mother; the cheerful, fantasizing, drunken father.The ultimate impression a viewer is liable to get is that the good folks who greenlighted this thought, 'Mary Poppins' was a terrific hit and made a fortune. We can't make a sequel, but let's make a movie about how the movie came to be made. It will be a salubrious blend of comedy and tear-jerker. Everyone who loved 'Mary Poppins' will come to see it. There must be some of the original audience left. We can pick over the bones of the carcass.' I thought it was too long and that the protracted flashbacks were designed to manipulate the audience. The point could have been made in less than half the time.Never having been a fan of 'Mary Poppins' -- never even having seen it -- I can only guess what the appeal is for devotées of the original.

Speed," Movie Culture
","It's always interesting to look at movies through history as if they were all part of the same overall culture, drawing on similar behavioral conventions and technologies. Like living cultures, movies have a historical context, undergo innovations, evolve over time to reflect changing folkways, and so forth. Speed gives us an ultimate example of innovation and originality, leading through convention, to utter decadence. There have been speed movies ever since there were movies and they were new and exciting at the beginning. The Keystone Kops were pretty good. Then they became conventional, with Model As careering around urban corners, tommy guns blazing out the windows; Bogart wheeling his speeding coupe up the slopes towards Mount Whitney in accelerated time. The big ones were saved until the movie's end usually. Then the car chase underwent what anthropologists call a revitalization movement. I'm talking about Bullitt. Nothing like this chase had (or has) been put on film. Then we enter a period of decadence, which we may define as increasingly perfunctory repetition and variation of a once-original idea. (The ancient Egyptians drew very careful open hands in their hieroglyphic script. Over the millenia, with less attention being paid and with a good deal of sloppy borrowing going on, the open palm managed to turn into a simple delta shape, from which we get our letter D. That's decadence. It's a real thing.) Well, if it's good once, let's do it again and make another nickel. Other outrageous chases followed in The French Connection, the Seven Ups, and so on; nicely choreographed but no longer original. Now the public has seen enough car chases. Let's introduce other vehicles into the chase. We can use a runaway cruise ship. Let's put the chase at the beginning -- why make the audience wait until the end? Beverly Hills Cop STARTS with a chase involving a car and some kind of garbage truck. Finally we reach a sort of climax with Speed. With the exception of some shenanigans on and in an elevator, the entire movie is one big chase involving diverse vehicles, most prominently a bus. Sandra Bullock is cute as the wisecracking girl drawn into the plot. Keanu Reeves is clean-cut and handsome, no more than that. But none of that matters. The only important thing is that lumbering behemoth banging cars off the freeway, leaping through 50 feet of open space, and smashing everything in sight. It's thrilling. Of course it's thrilling. We could dispense with the characters entirely and it would still be thrilling -- a thrilling hour and a half of a bus zipping along the streets of Los Angeles like a juggernaut and demolishing everything it can.I'm wondering. Surely they have a video game for children out by now, called 'Speed.' One point for each traffic sign or highway cone. You get five points for squashing a pedestrian. Ten points for a wrecking a car. Fifteen points for a truck. Glancing blows earn you half credits. If you turn too quickly and flop over, or if you hit a locomotive, you lose.",4,3,6,24 January 2002
Live Free or Die Hard," The DNA is degraded.
","The original 'Die Hard' was a crudely entertaining action movie with comic villains and a couple of humorous exchanges in addition to the usual violent sequences that had Bruce Willis as Officer John McClane running barefoot through a sea of broken glass. The next episode in the franchise, 'Die Harder,' switched the locale from the Nakatomi Building to Dulles and was essentially a repeat, duller than the first despite the enhanced special f/x. The third installment, 'Die Hardest of All,' or was it, 'Die, Whether You Like It Or not'?, put Willis back in New York with Samuel Jackson as his unwilling sidekick and Jeremy Irons as the least believable German heavy imaginable. It wasn't up to the standard of the original -- so few copies are -- but it was more entertaining than the second installment. I know. I got the titles all mixed up but these sequels come thick and fast and seem to pile atop one another like cow flops.This one keeps nothing more than the character of John McLaine and the acing of Bruce Willin in the part. He has devolved into a routine action hero. He has no vices. He doesn't smoke. He doesn't say anything that is politically incorrect. He doesn't use cuss words. He doesn't suffer from a hangover. He has no humanity to speak off. It could be Arnold Schwarzenegger in the part, or Sylvester Stallone, back in the 80s, or Dolph Lundgren or Jacques van Damm a decade ago. Interchangeable. In the next installment, may we look forward to a silver-haired Willis, his hair grown back, who is a vegetarian and is serenely awaiting The Rapture, the satisfaction of his utter boredom tempered by the saddening realization that the Jews, Moslems, Zoroastrians, Coptic Christians, and Animists of all stripes will not ascend into heaven to sittith in Paradise? Well, why not? This fourth outing has drained the character and plot of any blood the original had. The thing's been almost completely eviscerated. Nothing is left but the gall. The story involves the takeover and the threatened demolishing of the entire computer system that now permits the United States to function. But if you think you're going to learn anything about how this might be done, or if there will be suspenseful scenes in which we follow some hacker through the system, you'd be wrong.It's action, period, 24/7. That's all it's really about. There's little time left for humor or character development. Instead of Officer McClane hanging on the edge of an endless elevator shaft in the Nakatomi Building, there's an entire SUV dangling at the end of a cable in an elevator shaft. Not enough? Okay, there are two people having a vicious fight within the precariously suspended vehicle. Need still more? There's a guy a few floors up with an automatic weapon, shooting the SUV full of holes. And there is, trust me, nothing funny about the villains. The only wisecracks come from Willis and a young computer geek he drags around by the hair, and they're not very funny. What really makes me gag is that conversations now use a telegraphic style. Nobody says, 'Let's launch the rockets.' It's, 'Launch rockets,' even though the addressee is standing next to the speakers. Would you like to see one car smash into another in the Holland Tunnel, leap up, and spin over and over eight or nine times in mid-air? If so, this is the movie for you. If you're looking for anything in the way of comedy or human interest to balance the action, don't look here.",3,12,20,23 October 2008
Lucy," In Extremis.
","You can have too much of a good thing, assuming that intelligence is good, which some people seem to find arguable.I don't see much reason to go on at length about this computer-generated extravaganza. It begins in an ordinary way, as a decent B-rated thriller about drug smuggling from Taiwan through the rest of the civilized world. Unsuspecting carriers are kidnapped, knocked out, and a pouch of an extremely powerful drug is sewn into the linings of their bellies. What the drug is being smuggled for is an unanswered question. Evidently it doesn't get you high, so it's difficult to imagine a street market for it.Scarlett Johansson is one of those kidnapped by a band of Taiwanese evildoers who kill everyone who gets in their way or shows any hesitation before they cooperate., Johansson's pouch bursts within her and she absorbs this miraculous substance that boosts her cognitive capacity into the red zone. Thereafter, the quite respectable drug-smuggling tale turns into a bloody explosion of special effects that nobody -- not even some egghead who is utilizing 120% of his brain's capacity -- could grasp.The climactic scene takes us on a scenic tour resembling the Star Gate episode in '2001: A Space Odyssey' -- and if you thought THAT was a little hard to understand, wait until you see this.It all fails. I guess Luc Bresson, the director, wanted to somehow combine a crime thriller with science fiction but it's like getting a cobra and a mongoose to fall in love. He tries desperately and winds up with Wonder Woman.Not the fault of the actors, all of whom do the best they can with the material, including the biological and philosophical mumbo jumbo. 'We are dependent on time. If time stops, we stop.' (No kidding?) Scarlett Johansson is no longer a teen ager but a fully blown woman of whom more should have been made, so to speak. But what a role she's trapped in! The drug turns her into a kind of robot. She never smiles, rarely blinks, strides purposefully about, and clicks her head from side to side like a mechanical man in a circus. Morgan Freeman as the only scientist who can begin to understand what is happening to her comes off best. He's like a reassuring wild old uncle.No one could begin to fill in the plot's loopholes. She can feel the roots of a tree. (How do you do that?) She feels gravity. (Okay.) She feels every cell in her body, which might be a lot of fun if she had any human desires. But although she is able to shut down her nociceptors -- she can pluck a bullet out of her shoulder without wincing -- she's lost her sense of humor. That doesn't keep the writers from sticking in a wisecrack suitable for an Arnold Schwarzenegger action movie. She tortures some information out of a guy and leaves him with two jagged knives stuck through his hands, with the exit line: 'Thank you for sharing.' Some of her other lines ('I am everywhere'), well, I think I first heard it from Tom Joad in 'The Grapes of Wrath', and he stole it from Ralph Waldo Emerson. There's blood all over the place and explosions and car chases at supersonic speed and everyone's face is splashed with the gore of victims. When there's no overt gunplay we can watch a cheetah catch and kill a gazelle. Meanwhile there are galaxies of whirling colors and bobbing jelly-like phantoms constellating. The kids will love it.",4,2,7,14 August 2015
Moonrise Kingdom," You Can't Run Away From Yourself, Or From Social Services Either.
","I don't exactly know how to handle this film because I've never seen anything quite like it. It's basically the story of a twelve-year old boy and his young girl friend who run away from home, are pursued by the Boy Scouts and by Social Services, are married in a phony Boy Scout service, and are adopted (or something) by the local law officer, Bruce Willis. But it's so stylized in its presentation that it deserves bonus points for avoiding sentimental and comic cheap shots. I suppose that whether or not it's junk is arguable, but in either case it's not your ordinary Hollywood junk.The cast is filled with recognizable names in improbable roles -- Bill Murray, Frances McDormand, Harvey Keitel, Edward Norton, and others. But, by any measure, the two central figures are Jared Gilman as the near-sighted, talkative runaway Boy Scout and Kara Hayward as the go-anywhere, do-anything, taciturn girl who follows him and carries the luggage and her kitten in a pet carrier.The thing was shot entirely in Rhode Island and the locations are very attractive. We get to see a lot of them as the young couple trek through the woods and fields from bend of bay to swerve of shore. And, although little demand is placed on the couple as far as acting is concerned -- all they really have to do is recite lines as if learned by rote -- they're remarkably interesting. And their one or two scenes of burgeoning love are touching.And, I hate to mention this for fear of being taken for a 'prevert', but Kara Hayward has beautifully skewed features and dark penetrating eyes. The period is the mid-60s and she wears one of those very short skirts that were popular at the time. So dressed, she looks like a kid in the middle of her growth spurt. But when they fall in the water and she has to loll around in her underwear, it's clear that there is more to Kara Hayward than just spindly limbs. The writer and director must have been aware of this sexual element because they do absolutely nothing to suppress it. By contrast, also deliberate, I assume, the boy, Jared Gilman is a nerdy looking but not unpleasant short kid. Both of them are problem children and Tilda Swinton as the agent of Social Services, salivating over the prospect of putting them in an orphanage, is skewered.Without undue emphasis, the kids are given personalities, despite the intentionally stilted delivery of the dialog. She reads books of fairy tales and magic, and he sketches and paints. The music department should get a medal. Source music includes classic Hank Williams. The underscore is varied but relies heavily on Benjamin Britten. Under the end credits we hear part of his 'A Young Person's Guide to the Orchestra.' The romantic moments aren't really romantic. The kids are just kids, after all. And the adults have assignations that aren't at all romantic. And some of the comic moments could have come from Laurel and Hardy. Gilman stands atop a rock and faces his pursuers in the middle of a field. He's struck by lightning and when he sits up, his clothing and hair smoking a bit, he's in blackface, but he's not hurt.The story, with all its silliness and preposterous formalization, managed to keep me interested until the end. So Bruce Willis connives to save them from the Wicked Witch. Yet, the kids are 'married.' I wonder how he handles that.",7,0,0,28 May 2013
The Sixth Sense," Sluggish supernatural mystery.
","I realize this film had many good reviews. That's why I bought it. But it somehow managed to get by me without hooking me in. Its lack of impact had little to do with the acting, which is pretty good all around. Toni Collette is especially noteworthy. And Willis gives what is for him a subdued performance except, I have to say, that when he tries to grin with happiness or gets misty eyed with love, something within me begins to churn. The kid, Osment, is okay. Thank God he's not a cutie-pie.The direction is deliberate but effective, supported by a semi-somnolent score that throws in a sting from time to time, as when the first ghost appears briefly, to wake the audience up.The plot, alas, is a mish mash of overly familiar themes. Is it RIGHT to try to cure a kid who seems to know more than we do? (Cf., 'Equus.') Even if the kid is frightened by the 'dead people' he sees, who sometimes scream at him and scratch him? (Cf., 'The Shining.') How come the kid speaks Latin? (Cf., 'The Exorcist.') Or is this the momentary hallucination of someone who is dying? (Cf., 'Incident at Owl Creek Bridge,' or 'Point Blank.') Who are these ghosts anyway? Why do they taunt the kid? Why does he see only tortured ones, people who have been hanged, poisoned, killed in car accidents, shot in the belly, or who slashed their wrists? Do they see each other? Do they eat and excrete? They seem to have the power to move objects in their environment. They can steal bumblebee pendants or scratch the kid. They can, to give a more specific example, shove a box containing an incriminating tape out from under a bed and ask Osment to show the tape to their bereaved father. Well then why can't they themselves give Dad the box? Or leave it where he's bound to find it? If someone has done them dirt why must they use Osment as the middleman? Why not just kick ass? Oh, and a final question. By the end of the film we know why Osment finally spills the beans to Willis, but why on earth hasn't he told his mother about it a long time ago? 'I'm ready to communicate with you,' he tells her solemnly when they're trapped in a traffic jam. Well, why now?There is one way, though, in which the plot is cleverly constructed. In fact, the surprise revelation seems to have been thought of first and the entire movie structured around this anagnorisis. Yes, the story is as full of holes as a slice of Emmenthaler cheese but the whole point is the onion soup beneath. That climactic twist is a big relief in another way. Now we know why nobody wants to talk to Bruce Willis except Osment. And it's not his aftershave lotion.It's a pretty gloomy picture actually, awfully low key, though the photography of Philadelphia is engaging. Willis and his wife, Olivia Williams, are shown admiring an award he has just won, as the film opens. They're drinking wine and joking about Dr. Seuss, but even then there's no exhilaration on the screen.However, people seem to have given this film a cornucopia of plaudits so the weakness may be mine rather than the story's. There is no statistically significant difference between women and men in the user ratings -- he said confidently after merely eyeballing the results. I would have predicted a greater appeal for women. Maybe you'll get more out of it than I did.",4,9,18,21 February 2007
The Producers," Often Hilarious Mel Brooks Comedy.
","It's the first movie that Mel Brooks directed and it's a qualified success. There are at least as many belly laughs as in most of his later works. And the production gets bonus points for being sui generis. It's not a satire of Westerns or historical epics or silent movies. It's an original story. Generic conventions provide a kind of springboard from which to launch a spectacular send up. It's almost too easy. Want to satirize a traditional Western? Have the African-American laborers break into an a capella version of a Cole Porter standard. Throw in other anachronisms and allusions to contemporary issues. Funny but easy.Brooks the writer didn't have any such facile tactics at his command here because the plot was built of more or less novel elements from the ground up.Zero Mostel is a selfish and materialistic Broadway producer, down on his luck, who enlists the help of the shy and chronically anxious accountant Gene Wilder to bilk money out of rich little old ladies. The idea is to sell each of their ancient backers a large percentage of the profit from a play, but to make the play a total failure and keep the extra money for themselves. Why would the Internal Revenue Service be interested in the books of a play that folded on Night One? So they buy a thoroughly rotten play from a Nazi writer, played by Kenneth Mars, a musical celebration of the Third Reich that glorifies Hitler. Of course, there is always the risk of being caught and sent to jail. If, for instance, the play should be a hit they would have no way of paying off their investors.Mostel: 'Bloom, how much of the play can we sell?' Wilder: 'Max, you can't sell more than a hundred percent of anything.' Mostel: 'And how much of 'Springtime for Hitler' did we sell?' Wilder: 'Twenty-five thousand percent.' The movie has yocks galore. Both Mostel and Wilder have immensely expressive face. In a bar, they are joined for one scene by the marvelous Bill Hickey.But Mostel sometimes goes too far. He shouts, screams, makes gargoyle faces, jumps up and down, and the effort shows. And Wilder is forced to do much the same, weeping, shivering, ululating, shrieking gibberish. Kenneth Mars rarely reaches such a pitch of hysteria but he's consistently high on the scale from beginning to end. Dick Shawn plays Hitler and the audience, having second thoughts while walking out, finds him side splitting. I didn't. The best thing about Shawn's overdone performance is his singing the lyrics of Mel Brooks' song, 'Flower Power' -- 'Then he flush her down the sewer with the yukkk runnin' through her....' Some of the jokes, too, are dated. In 1968, commercial films were in a transitional state and, despite his brazenness, Brooks shades his gags on the cautious side. LSD is alluded to, there is no marijuana, and homosexuality is implied rather than openly exploited.But when the performances and dialog aren't over the top, they're absurdly funny. Mostel falling asleep on the doorstep while waiting for one of his paranoid patronesses to undo the dozens of locks on her apartment door. And the expressions on Mostel's and Wilder's faces in the theater when they realize the audience is applauding rapturously are unforgettable.",7,0,1,12 October 2009
Flight," What Goes Up Must Come Down, And Vice Versa.
","It's a pretty good movie, although it's a downer, and despite the fact that it was directed by Robert Zemeckis, most of whose output has so far been commercially oriented, abject junk.The script by John Gatins is thoughtful and not hurried. There are no car chases, no fist fights, no blood-spattered walls, nobody's head is wrenched off by a maniac. It's a character study rather than an action movie, and the character is Denzel Washington's commercial airline pilot.He wakes up in the morning with a flight a few hours ahead of him, shrugs off the beautiful nude girl, takes a swig of one of last night's many beers, does a line of cocaine, and -- WHAM! -- he's ready to fly.He boards the airplane still stoned enough so that the two stewardesses, as well as his co-pilot, notice something is wrong. The first officer observes him queerly as Washington straps himself in and takes a hit off the oxygen mask. 'Are you feeling alright, sir?', he asks.The first officer, a youthful looking guy who looks as if he should be a flight attendant, must have second sight because Washington does not seem stoned to me. The fact is, Washington is not a good drunk. He proved that in 'Courage Under Fire.' If you want to see a good drunk, watch Paul Newman in 'Verdict,' and Newman never drank anything stronger than beer.The airplane takes off with Washington in the left seat and hits some severe turbulence. The camera has evidently never flown through turbulent air in a large airplane because it is jarred from side to side as if it were being drawn on a cart over a rocky road. An aircraft wouldn't jiggle. It would feel more like an elevator that couldn't make up its mind whether to go up or down, but in any case would change its mind in a hurry and travel at high speed.Then things get twisted. Finally out of the storm, Washington activates the autopilot and takes a half-hour snooze behind the while. Bang, and something in the airplane's controls go awry. So does the callow co-pilot, shouting panicky imprecations.In the end, the National Transportation Safety Board determines that some threads were worn off in the bolts that held the elevators in position, and this put the airplane into a nosedive, from which Washington was able to recover by using his wits and his skills as a pilot. So far so good. But then the script ratchets up the sequential emergencies way beyond the red line. An engine cuts out, for instance. But what does that have to do with the failure of the elevator bolts in the plane's tail assembly? Nothing. Then the OTHER engine cuts out. Ditto. Then an engine catches fire. Ditto. And all this time the camera is being banged around like a ping pong ball. None of this is ever explained.Well, as I said, it's a character study. Washington does okay with his role. Sometimes he pulls off the drunk role believably by minimizing it; an occasional bump against an item of furniture. He gets able support from Don Cheadle as a timid lawyer, Bruce Greenwood (I think) as good friend Charlie, and Kelly Reilly (there's a Polish name for you) as the recovering addict who falls in with him for a time. The rotund John Goodman as Washington's cheerful dope supplier provides some semi-comic entertainment. The guy who is the head of Washington's airline could be Bill Murray's double except for his speech, which sounds filtered through a corn cob.Washington's character is sympathetic in that we all feel sorry for a guy in the grip of an addiction, but he's not really very likable. He lies all the time, about his drinking and everything else, until the cornball climax when he floods out and the unnecessary denouement in which he has a friendly chat with his estranged son under the blue summer skies.I've picked on some of the film's weaknesses -- there are others -- but I don't mean to be too harsh. It's a thoughtful and engaging movie. Only it could have been much better if the formula had not been so strictly adhered to -- the guilty man finally and willingly confessing his sins. It's all laid out. Compare it to the ending of Dreiser's 'An American Tragedy' or its cinematic offspring, 'A Place In the Sun.'",7,1,6,27 April 2013
Rear Window," Habitat for Humanity
","James Stewart, a prize-winning photographer, is cooped up in his Greenwich Village apartment with a broken leg. Bored, he watches his diverse neighbors around the courtyard. One of them, a salesman (Raymond Burr), seems to dispose of his nagging, invalid wife by chopping her up and removing her body in sections, but Stewart has no evidence. Gradually, he draws his nurse (Thelma Ritter) into his web of convictions, then his girl friend (Grace Kelly, than whom no girl friend is more gracious -- or better looking for that matter, all that nacreous beauty coiled around a soft pink core). But he is unable to convince his 'ornery old friend', the police detective, Wendell Corey, that anything is wrong. The climax reveals Burr to be a murderer, breaks Stewart's other leg, and smooths over some riffs in the Stewart/Kelly relationship. This is one of Hitchcock's best. It raises certain ethical questions, of course. Is it right for people to spy on one another? But the philosophical issues are minor compared to the virtues displayed by this film if taken as a simple mystery thriller. Everything comes together.It's from Hitchcock's best period, the 1950s, and the director does a laudable job. But it's one of those movies that requires the services of a crew that really knows its business, and they deliver. The performances by the principals is excellent, especially Stewart, on whose smallest movements the story depends. But the movie wouldn't be the success that it is without Franz Waxman's score, Robert Burks' photography, Sam Comer and Ray Moyer's set decoration, and the Sound Department. These aren't the kind of crew members who get noticed, except among their peers, but they put together a winner in this instance.Here's one example of what I mean. One of Stewart's neighbors, 'Miss Lonelyhearts,' lives alone and is given to having dinners with imaginary suitors. One night, after suitable preliminary libations, she goes out and picks up a younger man and brings him home. Instead of the decorous development of a romance, the testosterone-driven dude becomes aggressive and Miss Lonelyhearts must slap him to get him to stop. He leaves in a high dudgeon, or maybe, given the circumstances, a low dudgeon. Now, Stewart is watching this from his window across the courtyard. It's late evening and rather noisy. A pop song is playing somewhere. Stewart can't hear what's being said, and he can barely see the events through the half-closed blinds of Miss Lonelyhearts' apartment. Yet the sound of that slap registers, faintly but still audibly. It's the only clear sound we hear or need to hear from her apartment. It acts as punctuation, a period putting an end to this particular cardboard fantasy.The set is functional and evocative. There are about two dozen windows around the courtyard and Stewart can see almost all of them. The less important apartments are off to the side so he must bend over, but the other are accessible. (It's mid summer and the temperature is in the 90s, so everyone's windows tend to be open.) The construction of the set even yields a tiny sliver of the street across the way, and, with the help of a telephoto lens, even an interior glimpse of the restaurant on the other side of the street. And events of varying importance occur in these tiny porticoes. A murderer may be seen toting body parts off in a suitcase, just for a few seconds, on the sidewalk, or a photographer's girl may give him the high sign when he sends her off on an errand.The interior of Stewart's apartment is designed with precision. It's what I think is called a studio apartment -- just one room, not overly big, combining bedroom and dining room. There's a miniature kitchen off to the side, the interior of which we never see, and a bathroom, ditto. The place is cluttered with Stewart's memorabilia and other junk. How he can get around in that wheelchair amid the chaos we'll never know. If he had two functional legs he's STILL have to edge around sideways. And, man, do we get the feeling of heat, and of involvement with other people, so open and involved that they can't seem to get out of each other's way. That's why, when a miniature dog is strangled, and the owner across the courtyard screams out that nobody knows the meaning of 'neighbor' anymore, it rings false. None can be unaware of his surroundings. James Stewart is not a likable guy in this movie. He's edgy. He's superior, argumentative, neither invites nor projects warmth, is sometimes snotty to his visitors or even hostile. It's hard to imagine why his detective friend would have anything much to do with him. And he plays Grace Kelly like a hooked fish on a very light line. Kelly wants to get married and Stewart wants to keep things 'status quo.' She wants him to give up his adventurous, perambulatory life, wear dark flannel suits, and settle down to taking fashion portraits, which is definitely not his bliss. Kelly herself is always impeccably dressed, carries expensive luggage, and is perfectly satisfied with the comfortable life she leads among the social elite. At the end, in a consummately phony compromise, we see Stewart sleeping peacefully and smiling, the temperature now having dropped into the 70s, while Kelly sits curled on his couch and, after a glance at him, puts aside the book she's been pretending to read, 'Beyond the High Himalayas', and takes up a copy of Harper's Bazaar. Can anyone believe that this marriage will be a happy one? It's full of intrigue and suspense, finely done, and not to be missed. Not profound -- just 'deep' enough.",9,2,5,13 November 2007
Munich," International thriller, sober and adult
","Many viewers will remember the events at Munich as they unfolded. I remember Jim McKay announcing the deaths on television. Others should know about it just by keeping up with recent history. For those who don't know about it, Spielberg gives us a summary of what happened at the beginning of the film, mostly through TV news clips. The shootout at Munich airport is outlined in the first ten or fifteen minutes, after which the story turns to the organization of the Israeli response.My reaction was one of pleasant surprise because, by all the laws of commercial narrative, that horrifying, violent event should have been saved for the climax. (Eg., 'In Cold Blood.') Not only should it have been saved, but the deaths should be gone into in gory detail with exploding heads and mushroom-like fireballs. And here was Spielberg treating us like grown ups, trusting the audience enough not to feel the terror of those moments must be put on the stage and spelled out.As it turns out, Spielberg, now a charter member of the Hollywood community, couldn't entirely disregard the demands of conventional structure, and we get an explicit flashback -- brief and powerful, but still unnecessary -- near the end, and while the protagonist is making love to his wife. Fantasizing about a bloody tragedy while making love is probably not what most people do, depending on one's partner, I suppose.The rest of the film is far above the usual standards of the international action genre. There is in fact no more blood and guts than is called for. John Williams' music tells us more than what we need to hear about suffering, but the photography and location shooting by Janusz Kaminski are nearly flawless. The lead player, Eric Bana, not only performs well but looks the part of someone plucked out of an office and suddenly transformed into a dedicated assassin. His most routine expression changes from boyish surprise to dismal disillusion at the end.As a director, Spielberg doesn't make a false step. The action scenes are sometimes a little confusing but it seems to make them all the more effective. The most graphic death on screen is that of an attractive young Dutch woman who has murdered (or caused to be murdered) on of the team of assassins. Naked, shot in the chest with two small bullets, dripping blood from her lips, she slowly walks away and fondles her cat absent-mindedly.The tale, 'inspired by real events,' is presented with all its moral ambiguity intact. Guilt is brought up, but only briefly, and there is only one speech (by an Arab nationalist) that sounds written deliberately for the screen. But the script is full of observations that violate everyday standards of deference. One of the Israeli assassins backs off on a killing, saying, 'Thousands of years of suffering doesn't make you virtuous. We are supposed to be righteous. That is what I was taught.' So much for the power of victimhood. Just because you've been stomped on by history -- abused as a child, persecuted by the state, unjustifiably blamed for something, born with some socially devalued characteristic like dark skin -- it doesn't necessarily make your actions or your views morally superior to others'. That's a pretty bold statement, the kind that can be made only by Jews, blacks, abused wives, or displaced Palestinians.I was grateful too, for the way the film ended. The conventions require the demoralized hero to join his family in Brooklyn, sulk for a while, then return to his homeland while triumphant music swells in the background and his mother greets him with a hug. It doesn't happen. That's what I mean when I say the film is 'adult.' There are higher authorities than the bureaucracy one works for.There are no easy ethical answers because who knows why we fight and kill one another? Each of us has a personal excuse for what we do, and groups have collective excuses for what they do. Conflict might be based on ethnicity, religion, race, pride, or territory. And if we could somehow take away all THOSE reasons for murdering one another I'm afraid some others would emerge as overnight replacement. 'Your grandfather once insulted my grandfather.' By now, Spielberg has made a couple of genuinely good movies, and his talent is on display in this one.",9,6,10,6 January 2007
The Truman Show," All About the Man in the Moon.
","Kind of a complicated business, this film. Most of Peter Weir's movies are, but at least he lays open here the source of our discomfort. It's a palimpsest of basically three layers. (1) The visual story we see unfolding on the screen, the one that Peter Weir shows us. (2) The story as constructed by the world's greatest producer, The Man in the Moon named Cristof (Ed Harris), who manages the television show of which the thirtyish real-estate salesman, Truman Burbank (Jim Carrey), is the unknowing star. And (3) the presumed allegory that deals with such Big Issues as conformity, happiness, God, free will, artifice, and television.Carrey lives on glossy, carefully enameled Sea Haven Island, a paradisaical place of warm sunshine, neat middle-class housing, clipped and barbered lawns, cheery neighbors and co-workers, a beautiful and accommodating wife (Laura Linney), and a lifelong friend who bring him the occasional six pack of brewskies. Everything is peace and prosperity. Then things begin to seem a little odd to Carrey. When he breaks his routine, he stumbles into unsettling scenes. What should be the interior of an elevator turns out to be a craft service table with glazed donuts and a few strangers who gawk at him before running off.There isn't space to go on with this in any detail, but finally Carrey realizes that he can trust no one on the island and is literally a prisoner there. Every escape attempt is blocked by some incident -- traffic, an accident at a nuclear power plant -- something. He manages to sail away across the small sea and, pow, the bowsprit of his little boat punctures the wall of the largest television studio in the world. His life is a world-wide hit on TV, filmed on 5,000 hidden cameras. Given a choice between the scripted, almost perfect life he's been leading, and a new life full of challenges and entropy, he plumps for -- well, guess which one.As for level number two, the TV program built around the life of one Truman Burbank, who has been on the world's screens from the instant of birth until his final choice, Ed Harris is the man responsible and he and his crew live in the fake moon that hovers so picturesquely in Sea Haven's night time sky. Harris gives the best performance. His character brims with intricacies. His first thoughts are of the show, of the business part of it. It's sustained by product placement. Every artifact that Carrey touches or talks about brings in revenue. But Harris isn't at all a caricature. Of course he wants Carrey to stay put and the show to continue, but he's sentimental too. When he tells Carrey at the end, 'I was there when you took your first baby steps,' he's soft and convincing. But as the director of the world's greatest show, Harris is pretty clumsy and it's a wonder that it took the hero some thirty years to tumble. Carrey tries to leave the island on a bus but the bus won't start. The driver, an actor, calls, 'Everybody off,' and the other passengers who have been sitting like dummies all stand up at once and file out in order. That's not how it's done, not if it's to look like anything but acting. An experienced director would ask who was born in the first half of the year. They should stand up at random, some slow and others not, and crowd up at the door, followed by those who were born in the second half of the year. In fact, Harris is an extraordinarily inept director.That leads us to level three -- what's it all about? I'd be the first to admit I don't know. Peter Weir might even be the second. I doubt, though, that it's any accident that Ed Harris's director who lives in the fake sky goes by the name of Cristof. His mixed attitude towards Carrey is probably not accidental either. Harris has fits of pique when Carrey doesn't do as he's expected. (Cf., the Garden of Eden business in Genesis.) But he's merciful and spares the miscreant's life, edging into New Testament territory. If he's sometimes careless, maybe that's why we humans have this tendency to mutilate one another. Imagine a director who can stage an impromptu power plant accident off-island to stop Carrey but has extras check their watches before crossing the street. 'What, then, did the hand of the potter shake?' The world applauds when Carrey achieves free will, although nobody is sure that's such a hot idea. Look what happened to Alex in 'A Clockwork Orange.' No more space, I'm afraid. Good luck with the movie. It gets a lot of points for tripping up an audience expecting a dumb comedy or a dumb action movie. It's anything but that. Weir seems almost as ambitious as Cristof.One final question. Why in hell would an entire outside world be enthralled by a TV program about the life of a dull man? But maybe it's not worth asking in light of the popularity of reality TV shows like 'American Idol' and 'Survivor.'",7,0,2,5 January 2008
Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure," Clever Teen Comedy.
","I've only been able to catch snatches of this comedy so, though I know the essentials of the plot, I don't know how it ended. Presumably in a triumph for Bill, Alex Winter, and Ted, Keanu Reeves. Just a few comments.One is that the writing and the performances are concordant. Winter and Reeves both play their characters -- high schoolers in search of material for a term paper -- with open-mouthed stupidity. They're both pretty good too. There's hardly a second that they take seriously.Another is that the writing matches the plumbless depths of the characters' ignorance. Sigmund Freud becomes 'Frood,' for instance, and Beethoven becomes 'Beat-Oven' and Socrates turns into 'Sew' and 'Crates.' They think 'Thekid' is Billy the Kid's last name, as in 'Mister Thekid.' A third observation is that, amusing as the story can be, it's a pastiche, not as original as it thinks. The two characters, to whom everyone is 'Dude' (pronounced 'Dewd'), are clearly derived from Sean Penn's character, Jeff Spicoli, in 'Fast Times at Ridgemont High,' which appeared -- and became a hit -- seven years earlier. Winter even resembles Sean Penn. The movie also borrows the time travel device from 'Back to the Future' and its sequels, which began to appear -- to great commercial success -- four years earlier.This film itself was sufficiently successful to generate its own sequel -- 'Bill and Ted's Bogus Journey'. 'Back to the Future' had two sequels. And that's not to mention the several television series and merchandising.I laughed frequently while watching this thing. It raised an interesting question though: How stupid can you get? I mean, not just Bill and Ted but Hollywood and its MBAs. Is there some meaning to Bill and Ted's life other than facile self gratification? Is there any meaning in Hollywood other than a huge number preceded by a dollar sign? Has the well of imagination dried up? Is there anything at all left in it?",6,0,0,24 October 2010
Casino," Ossessione
","A reprise of Goodfellas, mostly, as has been pointed out, and although long, not as tired or boring as some have felt. How could a movie with Steve Allen and Jerry Vale be all bad? People have wondered why Scorcese and Coppola keep coming back to mobsters, specifically the Mafia, and all that corruption mixed with loyalty. Of course no one knows, perhaps not even the directors. But I suspect there are at least three reasons: First, it works economically. It draws the audience in. There is power and violence and sex to appeal to the men's fantasies. There is loyalty, intrigue, sheltered family lives, and the excitement of a wealthy rogue male for women. Second, Italian-Americans may return repeatedly to stories of the Mafia for the same reason that Southern writers deal over and over with themes of minority relations. In spelling out the stories, they are explaining the odd customs of their subcultures to the rest of us. Yes, we are hung up on these obsessions, just as you believe, and here is how things work -- a bit more subtle than you'd thought, aren't they? Finally, in exploring these themes in the interests of the outsider's better understanding of them, they can explore their own conflicts in model form, as stated in the anthropologist John M. Roberts' conflict-enculturation hypothesis. When we view something with ambivalence we tend to poke around in it, to touch it, fascinated by it. If we can't actually DO the thing itself -- become a mobster, endorse slavery -- we can play games with the idea, constructing little mock worlds in which we can jiggle the concepts around. In conflict about having children? Well -- you don't really need to. You can nurture something that is a model or surrogate child. Cats and dogs will do fine. But if your conflict is more intense, you are driven to less recognizable models. House plants, say. And if the conflict is VERY intense, you can start a coin or a stamp collection. What, after all, do you do with a stamp collection? You conceive of the idea, you start it when it's small, you feed it, you watch it grow and get bigger, and when it gets too big, or when you lost interest, you sell it on eBay and it moves out of the house. Directing a movie means constructing a model world too, like the model social world of a chess game.In a movie, you lay out a plot, cause the characters to do certain forbidden things, and imagine how you might feel if you were doing them yourself. I'm not surprised that Scorcese made this movie, or that he's filled it with Italian-American actors. I'm not surprised that Faulkner wrote Intruder in the Dust, or that Judith Rossner wrote Looking for Mr. Goodbar, or that Philip Roth wrote Portnoy's Complaint. These model worlds they've created deal with issues like crime, race, female sexuality, and ethnic loyalties that have kept Italian-Americans and Southerners and feminists and Jews marginal to the rest of our culture. The artists are trying to explain to us and to themselves how things look from the inside. If these issues ever disappear, which is most improbable, the conflicts will ease, marginal populations will no longer be prompted to produce such intense work, and the rest of us will be poorer for it.Maybe in this case Scorsese did too good a job of it. I found myself listening to DeNiro's voice-over telling us that the James Woods character was a 'scumbag' because he was a small-time chiseler chasing dentists on the golf course, taking money from the whore Sharon Stone. But who is DeNiro's character to make such judgments? Woods is detestable because he's a vellicating minor hood with no money? Whereas DeNiro is morally superior because he's a major player with LOTS of illegal gains? We admire DeNiro because he is the more successful crook. The moral calculus is a little confusing. On top of all that highbrow stuff -- man, does Scorsese know how to stage a fierce family fight. I should know. And that opening scene -- a car explosion backed by the majestic sweep of Bach's Missa Solemnis!",7,8,12,3 September 2002
Heat," Excellent crime thriller.
","This is a long, involved, and generally superior caper movie, something on the order of 'The Asphalt Jungle' but with a cop thrown into the sauce. In addition, as a kind of subplot, we have a duel of wits between Pacino who represents LA's Robbery and Homicide, and DeNiro as the head of the honorable gang betrayed by a renegade member.The cast on the whole is splendid. Pacino gives a wide-eyed arm-waving, thoroughly enjoyable performance. As his third wife, Diane Venora with her feline eyes is the sensible spouse who feels she is not sharing her husband's life because he doesn't feel she should know about the rottener side of his work. If this sounds a bit familiar, it may be because you've run into this conflict in so many other movies, including 'Bullit', 'The Godfather,' and others. She is the only character who is given lines that make her sound as if she's gone to college -- 'What you do is sift through the debris, then pick up the scent and follow it,' describing how she views her husband's job.DeNiro is more restrained, thoughtful, solemn, always seeming to be strangling his passion. His motto: 'Never get involved in anything you're not ready to turn your back on and walk out of in thirty seconds flat.' Until he meets Amy Brennerman, a pretty young woman who turns in an understated performance filled with nuance. Brenneman looks like -- well, if you like Katy Couric, you'll like Amy Brenneman. Val Kilmer's pinched face has now progressed beyond prettiness and has acquired real character, matched by his acting here. Two performances are absolute standouts. John Voight as the avuncular source of street information, a kind of Mentor to the gang, is flawless in the role. He has turned into a marvelous character actor. And Ashley Judd as Kilmer's love interest has to be one of our more underused and underrated actresses. She has plump lips, darting dark eyes, and a most mobile face and expressive body, able to convey more with a smile or a gesture than imaginable. She is a magnetic presence in this movie and in some others, so much so that when she is on screen she seems to command it without trying. All the major characters have domestic problems, including an African-American driver recruited by the gang at the last minute. But these conflicts are secondary to the main thread of this complex plot, which involves two big heists, several shoot-outs in crowded streets, and a couple of murders in between, some of them off screen. The film is as admirable for what it leaves out as what it includes. There are -- this may be difficult to believe -- there are no slow-motion scenes of violence and not a single car chase. A man trying to escape in a pickup is shot while speeding away. The traditional, moribund thriller/action scenario DEMANDS that this vehicle either blow up like a Claymore or end its earthly existence in a spectacular slow-motion crash. But, no. The director has the truck with the dead man slumped at the wheel slow down and roll to bump gently against a cyclone fence. Yes, folks, it's true. See it for this reason if for no other.",8,1,2,1 March 2002
Thirteen Days," Night in the lonesome October.
","It's October of 1962, our most immemorial year. President Kennedy (Bruce Greenwood) and his staff, including Bobby Kennedy (Dylan Baker) and Kevin O'Donell (Kevin Costner), discover that the Soviet Union is building intermediate-range nuclear missiles on communist Cuba, ninety miles off our coast, destabilizing the standoff between the West and the Soviet Bloc. Once operational, the missiles put Russia on our doorstep and can't be permitted to exist. What to do? The film shows us with reasonable clarity what was done. The US couldn't just sit there and do nothing. The White House drew up plans for a strike against the missile sites. But then the Soviets could just rebuild them. Therefore, another invasion of the island was required, which would in turn provoke a Soviet response elsewhere, probably against Berlin.One thing leads to another and pretty soon there is no more world left to argue about.How is the problem solved? Kennedy puts Cuba under a blockade, surrounded by Navy ships. Technically, a blockade is an act of war, so we call it a 'quarantine,' because that word is not an act of war. Russian ships continue their approach.Neither the US nor the USSR is able to back down without losing 'honor,' never mind any practical advantages. So an off-stage channel is opened up by the Soviets between their top spy in New York and the New York Times. The Russians are willing to consider a trade. They'll remove the missiles if we pledge never again to invade Cuba. (We'd done it the year before, in The Bay of Pigs fiasco.) Of course, it's not that simple. The real world seldom is. A letter arrives from Khrushchev agreeing to the deal, causing a great big sigh of relief in the White House. But the next morning a far less conciliatory letter arrives, backing out of the concessions agreed to in the first letter. Analysis reveals that the first letter was written by Khrushchev, but that the second had been polished by someone else. Has Khrushchev been deposed in a coup? Better put on the old kit bag again.But Bobby Kennedy comes up with an idea. How about if we only respond to the first letter? Does he mean we reject the second letter? No, just that we ignore it as if it had never happened.At a last-minute meeting with the Soviet Ambassador, Bobby Kennedy informs the Russians that we have some outdated missiles in Turkey that are scheduled for dismantling, and that, if necessary, Chairman Khrushchev can claim these as part of the deal, as long as it's never made public. That way, Khrushchev can satisfy the hard-liners in the Politburo without humiliating the United States.The problem is solved and everyone totters back from the brink of nuclear war.There's another, similar film, 'The Missiles of October,' with William DeVane as Kennedy and Martin Sheen as Bobby. It's quite good, but it's made for television and lacks the production values and special effects of this version. The TV movie is dry and logical, and it tells us more about Khrushchev, whose huevos were also in a vice. This one carries more emotional weight since we get to know about the individuals involved.The final scenes are moving, as O'Donell stares from the window of his home the next morning, surrounded by his wife and children, bathed in the early light, and says wonderingly to himself, 'The sun came up.' It's not as tacky as I've made it sound.One of the more stunning features of the movie is the analytical plane on which these round-table discussions take place. No decision is made without brainstorming and without confirmation of beliefs, when that's possible. These people were careful, delicate, surgical in their decision making. The president alludes to Sun Tzu before Sun Tzu was cool. He draws a history lesson from Barbara Tuchman's 'The Guns of August,' about the accidental beginnings of World War I. It's become a little more difficult to imagine such discussions in political circles today. Nobody seems to have gotten past the Cliffs Notes version of 'The Prince.' Too bad, too, because, as the French philosopher Henri Bergson suggested, a leader should think like a man of action and act like a man of thought. Somewhere along the line, that became 'Kill 'em All and Let God Sort 'em Out!' and was printed on bumper stickers.The performances are all adequate, with Greenwood giving a decent impression of JFK. The other character all more or less resemble their historical counterparts -- more so than in the TV version -- although the characters and the event itself have faded so much in our collective memories that it probably doesn't make much difference anymore. Dean Rusk might as well look like Yosemite Sam.The people who probably most need to see this film are probably going to switch channels out of boredom. After all, nobody's head gets wrenched off in the second reel.",7,0,1,30 November 2009
300," Hooah!
","The story of Spartan King Leonidas holding the Persian Army of Xerxes at bay at the battle of Thermopylae. As far as I can remember -- I was there but it's been a long time -- it's reasonably accurate historically although perforce some of the dialog must be fabricated.If it has any redeeming social value it's probably that the kids who are the intended audience will learn that there was once a city called Sparta that wasn't in Mississippi.But the photography and f/x are something special. Images are in high contrast and tinted a kind of gold except at night, when they're tinted a kind of blue. Not midnight blue but kind of a neon blue.The acting is professional in caliber. Some of the monsters (for that's how they're depicted) overplay their roles, if that's possible. The women are attractive and it's interesting to see that the queen has been outfitted by Dior or somebody, wearing a dress cut perilously low on her iliac crests. The men are uniformly built. Their pecs are massive. Their abs are rock hard. In fact, they're built almost identically. Can you photoshop a group scene? If it weren't for the photography and f/x it could be a sword and sandal epic from 1958 filmed in Cinecittá starring Lance Sterling (née Guglielmo Gogliucci). But the photography alone almost redeems the film. The skies are straight out of J. M. W. Turner, smoky and smudged, but slowly swirling.It's thought provoking but the thoughts it provokes are primitive. There is no overlap between good (white Spartans) and evil (black Persians). This kind of binary thinking is dangerous because it's liable to lead us into believing that this is the way the real world works -- all good versus all evil -- whereas in fact God didn't make the universe in a way that renders it so easy for humans to understand.Too bad they distilled Spartan culture into nothing more than a lot of heroes taking 'drunk delight in battle with my peers.' The Spartans certainly fought well and the battle scenes are impressive except when they lapse into very slow motion or are overcranked to lightning speed.Sparta must have been a nice place to visit though you wouldn't want to live there. They periodically raided their neighbors, the peaceful Helots, for slaves. Older mentors adopted young boys as sexual objects. If a newborn was deformed or otherwise deemed unfit it was put down.",3,4,9,5 December 2017
Apollo 13," Nice execution of uplifting family movie.
","Sometimes I find myself getting them mixed up -- Ron Howard, Rob Reiner, Penny Marshall. Even Spielberg's heartwarming kiddie movies. They're often enjoyable viewing and they're suitable for children of all ages. Early conflicts between two people of honor are resolved. There's often a patriotic theme. Very few cuss words. The musical score tells us emphatically that this is a moving experience. Maybe not the Second Coming exactly but a dangerous trip to the moon or a damned good baseball game. And don't worry. Our side wins.This one is about a failed trip to the moon. The 'failed' part of it is gotten past pretty quickly and the emphasis shifts immediately to a different challenge -- can we get the crippled craft and its stressed-out crew back to the earth in one piece? The answer of course is yes, so it turns the movie into a story of triumph instead of tragedy.I don't mean to apply too energetic a hammer to the real events or the real characters. It's pretty spooky stuff, being up there, looking at the earth when it's no bigger than a street lamp. The rest of us who tremble when we have to climb a ladder higher than the first-floor windows can only marvel.And the story itself, no matter well or poorly told, has enough suspense and awe intrinsic to it that we can't help being drawn into it.What's bothersome is the slick commercialism that seems to provide the craft and its story with its real source of power. You know ahead of time that we'll spend time with the anguished wife at home, that we'll see one endangered astronaut sharing pictures of his lovely family with the others. The reporters will becoming a nagging, intrusive nuisance. The wife will be given a line like, 'If this moon landing wasn't good enough for the press, why has it become news now that it won't land?' There are a multitude of technical problem that arise when the side of the craft pops and deconstructs, and they're rushed through as if the audience doesn't really care about the challenges or how they're met. Or -- maybe not that the viewers don't care. Maybe they're too dumb to understand. The technical glitches and maneuvers seem to present challenges to the film makers as well -- how quickly can we get rid of the uninteresting metallic junk and get back to the suffering of the crew, the ground support, and the families? It succeeds extremely well in doing what it intends to do, but what it intends to do makes few demands on the maturity of viewers. It's like a very complicated jigsaw puzzle and after you put it all together you have a picture of three dogs in vests playing cards.You know what could be gripping? The real story of the Challenger disaster of 1986. With an emphasis on the groupspeak of Raytheon, Mission Control, and NASA. Maybe the hero could be Richard Feynman. You should have seen him cut through the blizzard of technocrap thrown up by the engineers and bureaucrats playing CYA at the hearings. Here they are, explaining what happened by evoking 'ambient temperature values' and 'minimalizing coefficients.' And Feynman asks politely, 'You mean when it gets cold the rubber shrinks?' And he demonstrates by dunking a piece of rubber in a glass of ice water. Doesn't that have more cinematic potential than this movie's Ed Harris shouting, 'Failure is not an option'?However, the kids should enjoy this, and it's worth watching for everyone, if only because it is based on a true story. Its heartwarming qualities aside, everyone involved in an enterprise like this -- successful or not -- should be applauded. And whatever they're being paid, it's not enough.",5,2,10,3 November 2006
The Thin Red Line," Ars poetica
","I hate to use a word like 'intentionality' in commenting on a movie, but it seems necessary in this case. It means something like the 'reality' that is constructed between one person and another, shaped by the desires of the main actor. (I hate to use the word because (1) hardly anybody understands it completely, and (2) I don't understand it completely either.) What Terrence Malick has done in 'The Thin Red Line' is to ask the audience to participate in his construction of the experience of combat. To appreciate what he's done is to see it partly through his eyes, his point of view, and that point of view is a combination (not always a perfect solution) of realism and poetry. It reminds one of another war movie, from 1945, I think, Lewis Milestone's 'A Walk in the Sun.' And to a lesser extent John Huston's 'The Red Badge of Courage.' Malick's movie, like Milestone's, has a narrator with a penchant for humanistic comments. (Huston's narrator was a lot more matter of fact about war.) Malick doesn't use narration often and that's a good thing because a little of these elliptical lines goes a long way in this context. There is none of the usual banter about the chow. And the voiceovers aren't used for their usual purpose -- telling us about events without having to show them. ('After I slapped her around, she told me what had happened back at the hotel. Malloy had slipped the fat man a mickey, then Thelma put two holes through Skinny Jackson and betrayed the old lush.') And there's not a wisecrack in a cartload. A GI daydreams about the wife he left behind. 'We are together. We come together. We are like water.' That sort of thing. Makes you feel like you're back in college, sitting on the floor and trying to seduce a girl by candlelight. It isn't bad by itself, but as James Jones showed us in his novel, these are not the kinds of guys who are likely to think in anapestic trimeter. They're not going to have flashbacks to undressing their wives, not while crawling towards an enemy bunker. They're just ordinary goons, most of them, rednecks from Tuscaloosa or factory stiffs from Gary, who are attacked by the Japanese while moving their bowels, or have situational homosexual encounters, or who deliberately take a sitting position and fire single shots from their M1s at an overwhelming horde of approaching enemy until they are inevitably cut down.But Malick is intent on taking us beyond that kind of ordinariness. He interpolates shots of nature. The hazy tropical sun shining through a raggedy leaf with holes. The hills are covered with tall emerald grass that waves smoothly as the breezes wash over it. A naked soldier swims underwater with the naked native kids. A bird, newly hatched, still blind, feebly moves its limbs in the rank and blackish mud, dying. Dozens of flying foxes hang upside down from the branches, peering at the soldiers, as if trying to figure out why these guys are all upside down.It's an intense film and an expression of a very personal vision. I wouldn't be surprised if some simply gave up trying to play the game.But it has some very good action scenes, which I won't go into, and the Japanese are human beings rather than 'bandy-legged baboons' ('Bataan,' with Robert Taylor).The acting is very good too. In some cases very good indeed. The soldiers are all dressed alike, regardless of role or rank, in fatigues dark with perspiration. It's difficult to tell one from another. In compensation Malick uses a lot of closeups so that we can see the men's faces. Elias Koteas, who plays Staros, a lawyer in civilian life, has the wide open eyes of a man who is scared to death of doing his duty but brave enough to not do it. It may be Nick Nolte's best role as the fustian, shouting, ambitious, savvy, ego-maniacal commanding officer. He desperately needs success in combat as a means to promotion. 'The old guys, they've HAD their war. This is MINE!' I will take the liberty of directing your attention to his performance during a particularly dramatic moment. He orders Captain Staros over the phone to make a suicidal frontal attack. Staros respectfully refuses. Nolte makes it clear that this is an ORDER. Staros refuses. And it finally becomes clear to Nolte that Staros is telling him to take his order and shove it. Nolte's head jerks back in a spasm, his jaw drops in awe, and he is utterly speechless, awed by a situation he'd never anticipated. He wipes his nose, blinks, spits, looks around. I've never witnessed him in a better scene.A shame that this came out at the same time as 'Saving Private Ryan.' Spielberg wants us to look at the external realities of combat, the gore, the bullets clanking on armor, the injustice of it all. Malick on the other hand invites us to look inside the men. Brutality there surely is, but when a GI is waiting for a wounded Japanese to die before he pulls out his gold teeth with a pair of pliers, he lectures him softly on how little it means. That's an intentionality of a different color.It's understandable that some viewers might be turned off by this. It's a depressing, original, thoughtful, and deeply disturbing film. I wonder if Malick has ever considered making a documentary about nature -- habitat destruction or something.",8,1,2,29 November 2005
The Great Escape," Taut POW Escape Story.
","This long movie is organized along the same lines as 'The Dirty Dozen.' The first two thirds of the running time introduce us to the characters and their organization around a common goal. In 'The Dirty Dozen' it was a suicide mission for condemned prisoners. Here it's escape from a prison camp for Allied airmen in Bavaria. The last third deals with the execution of the plan.It's well written and there are some understated comic touches interspersed with the suspenseful tale of the digging of the escape tunnel, the preparation of fake papers, the manufacture of civilian clothing from scraps and rags and blankets.The implementation of the plan, the last third, turns serious. Of the 250 men designated as escapees, only 70 get out and most of those are either captured and returned or killed outright by the Gestapo.Actually, this is a pretty nice camp compared to, say, that in 'Stalag 17.' It's situated among the rolling green hills and evergreen woods and distant mountains, rather like a picture postcard or a fairy tale or a particularly ornate cuckoo clock. The camp is strictly for hardcore escapees and is run by the Luftwaffe in a determined but not entirely unfriendly manner. The barracks themselves are spacious and reasonably comfortable. At the end, Steve McQueen is returned to the camp just as the sympathetic Luftwaffe officer is being relieved of command and taken away by the Gestapo to God knows where. 'Well,' the officer remarks to McQueen, 'It looks like you will see Berlin before I do.' I thought it was ungracious of McQueen to smirk.The other Germans we see, outside the camp, are stereotypical bastards. The fifty men who are to be executed are brought together by the Gestapo, whose commanding officer tells Richard Attenborough, 'You vill be sorry dzhat you put us to zo motch twubble.' It's an enjoyable flick, filled with diverse pleasures and some tragic moments. It seems to have acquired a following whose devotion to the movie borders on cultism. I'm not sure why. The performances are all decent but it's a formulaic movie and the roles don't give anyone much of a chance to stretch his acting chops. Steve McQueen is not the epitome of cool that he was to become in a few years. John Sturges' direction is functional, effective, commercial, and exciting, as it was in many of his other action films.Nicely done.",6,1,3,28 May 2010
Pineapple Express," This is their brains on drugs.
","A description of the characters and the plot make the film sound as silly as an old Popeye cartoon, but it does have its moments and adults ought to find it almost as amusing as its target audience of teens. You'd never think laughs could still be gotten out of weed heads but marijuana works here as a kind of plot engine. If it weren't for some dynamite pot known as 'Pineapple Express,' nothing would have happened.It's Los Angeles and there are two high-echelon drug organizations at war -- one run by Gary Cole, the other by Asians. The two protagonists -- Rogen and Franco -- are everyday users, with Franco a small time dealer and Rogen a process server. (Franco, in all seriousness, 'What do you serve? Like, hamburgers?') Rogen witnesses a murder by Cole, flips away his roach and flees the scene with a great deal of commotion. Cole watches the car speed away, picks up the discarded butt, puffs on it, and says 'Pineapple Express.' Alas, the brand is so rare that it can easily be traced to dealer Franco. Realizing this, and it's one of the few things they DO realize, Rogen and Franco hastily pack up and leave everything behind. The rest of the movie is largely a story of pursuit, with shootings, a high speed car chase, various explosions and a general atmosphere of hysteria.It's pretty funny. The most outrageous performance is by Seth Rogen who gives expert imitations of flooding out with fear, screaming hoarsely, waving his arms, weeping. Franco, comparatively speaking, has a Zen quality about him. Craig Robinson, as a semi-moronic hit man, gives a splendid performance and is given some good lines. 'You know, I may look tough but I have feelings too, and you just hurt every one of them.' But then many of the lines are -- well, not exactly WITTY, but funny nevertheless. While they are discussing their perilous situation, Rogen asks Franco if it's really possible for Cole and his gang to track them down. How could they do it? Franco, befuddled by dope, muses, 'I don't know. Bloodhounds maybe. Dogs. Barracudas.' There's a good deal of slapstick at the end during a bloody but still comic shootout, but that too is well choreographed. Grownups ought to get a kick out of at least some of the scenes and some of the dialog.",6,1,2,13 April 2017
Jackie Brown," Nicely Crafted.
","SPOILERS.A true original, and the director's best.The influence of Quentin Tarrantino is ubiquitous and obvious, and I'm not sure that's entirely a good thing. Every popular style, no matter how original, prompts imitation until originality becomes cliché. Look at what happened to Hitchcock. I won't bother to spell out the ingredients of this particular style except to mention in passing cross-racial aggregations, plenty of obscenities, crime, diversionary discussions of things like hamburgers, unexpected explosions of blood, and an underlying feeling that what ought to be tragic is really ridiculously funny.All of those ingredient can be found in 'Jackie Brown,' a very well executed (and complicated) crime story. The acting has to be good, and it is. Samuel Jackson is outstanding as a ghetto-type gun broker worried about his half million dollars. What a job he does! He switches from cool to threatening in a second. And when he is exasperated, which is about half the time, his eyes pop in disbelief and his voice cracks and toggles into the upper register like a coloratura soprano's.Everyone else is equally good, although their roles may not call for that kind of razzle dazzle. Robert Forster hasn't been seen often on the screen lately. He's introduced here in a kind of crabwise manner in a part that at first seems like it may be nothing more than a featured bit. He'd make a good utility player. Pamela Greer is simply fine. She glides between standard English and ghetto register with ease. She's not the staggering beauty that she was in the 1960s but her age is put to good use in this film, savvy but warm. If anyone sounds like a professional actor reciting lines, it's Bridget Fonda, but that's okay because she's supposed to be a hedonistic airhead and besides her long tan legs make up for any real deficiency.The story itself is kind of intricate, possibly more than it needed to be. The director leaves out a few linking scenes that might have reduced any confusion we feel about what's going on. As it is, I lost track of the money sometimes amid the comings and goings. No wonder Michael Keaton, my co-star in 'The Squeeze,' was left scratching his head.And if the direction is a bit derivative, it at least respects the viewer without indulging the genius of the director himself. There is one scene that is seen at different times from three separate points of view, but the tactic is used to clarify the events. Basically the plot unfolds logically, with just enough time taken to explore some of the principal characters.You'll probably enjoy it.",8,2,5,3 November 2004
Monty Python and the Holy Grail," Mostly Pointless. Sorry.
","I'm beginning to wonder if there's something wrong with my neurology, some recently formed gnarled tangle of cells, some neuronal accident, some collapse of axonal hillocks or something. I caught snatches of this film years ago and wasn't too amused. Now I've just watched it as part of the boxed set and it's still not very funny.I guess I get the general thrust, which is a comic undermining of Arthurian legends -- the holy grail, the monsters, the valorous knights in battle, the journeys, and so forth. I'm for the goal but the episodes that illustrate this fictional legend are more silly than witty, like Mel Brooks at his worst.Take one of the first scenes. Arthur and his knights face a French castle and demand entrance. The guard at the battlements points out that they aren't riding horses. There's just some guy clapping two coconut halves together. Everybody knows there are no coconuts in England. The knights are indignant. They point out that the coconut could have been carried from the south by air, perhaps by a bird, maybe a swallow. And there follows an argument with the French guard over whether either of two types of swallow could build up flight speed while carrying a coconut. The dispute goes on for several minutes. It's obviously designed to be funny but it only struck me as silly -- as did the notion that coconut halves could be substituted for horses in the first place.It seemed as pointless as the confusion of the two guards when they received the order to keep the nobleman in his room in the tower, not to let him out until they received permission. It simply goes on too long. Abbot and Costello could have done it.The killer rabbit, ditto. The joke reached its punch line the moment the rabbit appeared.I remember hearing laughter at the back of the theater. Someone must have been telling jokes back there.'The Life of Brian' is far funnier, perhaps because the farce has a target that is still alive and spastically kicking. And 'The Meaning of Life' was better yet because of its underlying edginess and dying fall.",3,10,24,1 July 2012
Saboteur," Streamlined, ergonomic
","The story is spelled out elsewhere -- Cummings being mistaken for a saboteur and getting mixed up with a real gang -- so I'll pretty much skip it and just add a few comments.First, it's identifiably Hitchcock, but is an example of his lighthearted thrillers not his more ambitious dramas. Think of it as being in the same class as, say, 'The Lady Vanishes' or 'North by Northwest.' Aside from a speech Robert Cummings makes to the Nazis at the mansion -- about 'you and your kind' -- none of this is meant to be taken very seriously. This is also the first use Hitchcock makes of an American landmark or even an identifiable American landscape in his films. It isn't his first use of landmarks as setting for a chase, since he earlier used the British Museum. He does better here with his mockup of the Statue of Liberty, which also carries a (rather heavy) symbolic weight.The score is kind of sweet and musically a little tricky, but there is no music at all while Cummings is holding the villain Norman Loyd by the sleeve at the top of the statue. The scene cries out for explosive dramatic suspenseful collossal stupendous orchestration -- and Hitchcock keeps it silent except for a few whispered words from Loyd. The plot has more holes than a slice of Swiss cheese but it doesn't matter much. 'The FBI arrived at my ranch,' says the suave Otto Krueger. 'Luckily I was just leaving.' The mother of the victim at the beginning seems to believe that Cummings, the victim's best friend, may have deliberately murdered him. A hole has been drilled in the wall of a deserted shack so that Cummings can find a telescope and look through the hole and see what appears to be Boulder Dam and cotton to what's going on. Oh, well.The makeup department should have been penalized (or drafted). In some scenes Cummings is so plastered with makeup that he resembles a silent screen hero like Valentino. And sometimes the delectably cream-fed Priscilla Lane looks almost ordinary.The best performances are from Otto Krueger, who switched from music to acting, fortunately, and from Alan Baxter as the soft spoken and not entirely unsympathetic heavy. We first see Baxter as he enters the abandoned shack at Soda City with Clem Bevins, brushing the dust fussily from the sleeve of his dark jacket. And he has a truly amazing conversation with Cummings in the back seat of a car while they are being driven to New York. It's a complete non sequitur dealing with Baxter's two young sons. He describes them lovingly and then talks about how much he wanted a girl. He asks Cummings if it would be acceptable to raise a boy nowadays with long hair, adding that when he himself was a child he had beautiful long golden curls. 'You might do the kid a favor if you got him a haircut,' advises Cummings! It's sometimes easy to make fun of Hitchcock and call him nothing more than a successful commercial hack, but it's almost impossible to imagine scenes like these appearing in another director's work, not with such consistency. As far as that goes, few other directors would have the imagination to roll the credits against a blank wall and, afterwards, have an ominous black shadow of smoke unfurl itself against that background. But that's only visual flair. Not that it should be dismissed, but that conversation between Cummings and Baxter I think tells us much more about what exercised Hitchcock's interest aside from patterns on a silver screen.",Null,34,43,29 May 2004
Gangs of New York," Fine acting, spectacle.
","Man, this doth bestride the world of 1860s New York like a colossus. It begins with a battle on the streets of the (now disappeared) Five Points of New York City, between the Irish immigrants led by Liam Neeson, head of the Dead Rabbits gang, and the nativists, led by Daniel Day-Lewis, sporting the most down-home working-class New York accent you ever heard, a real phoneme-mangler, and the waxiest mustache as well, playing Bill the Butcher. Neeson is killed in battle, which stops the fight, as it did in ancient times, and Day-Lewis bellows out to the stunned mob, 'The Dead Rabbits is gone forever. Let their name never be spoken from this time onward!' Neeson's son grows up to be Leonard DeCaprio and when he returns to Five Points he his taken under the wing of Day-Lewis, until his identity is revealed. Cameron Diaz is around here somewhere, swishing through bar rooms, half-built churches, and underground caves. Another street battle is arranged. Coincidentally it takes place during the historic draft riots of the Civil War period. Day-Lewis is killed by DeCaprio, and the feud is buried.I couldn't tell one gang from another but I loved their names. They are rooted in historical reality, I think, and they include not just the Dead Rabbits but the Chichesters, the Bowery Boys, and the Plug Uglies. The Plug Uglies derive their name, I understand, from a 'volunteer fireman's group.' There were thirty-seven such groups. There being no fire department to speak of at the time, volunteer groups were paid by the fire, which led to the expected results. Not only competition by rival groups to reach the fire first, but sometimes co-opting the fire by having a handful sit on the fire plugs and reserving them for their own group. (Arson by the firemen themselves also generated profits.)That's the kind of detail that Scorsese jimmies into this movie. We get to see some historical figures, such as Boss Tweed, and we witness their machinations. But the director's real interests lie elsewhere -- intrigues among the gang members and their molls, revenge, murders, public assassinations, things like that. I know. It sounds like the Corleone family. Unfortunately that's probably the weakest part of the film. There is usually a great sense of 'place' and 'tribe' in Scorsese's work. The Five-Points set is splendidly done but I couldn't get a sense of what was where. Transitions from exteriors to interiors, and the relation of community features to each other, were confusing. And although Day-Lewis's character was nicely delineated, and our attitude towards him necessarily ambivalent, I wasn't itching for DeCaprio to off him and stand victorious over his body -- which is part of the gangs' code. ('Ears and noses are alright, but nobody touches this body!' That's another order from Day-Lewis about taking post-battle trophies. Another guy gets paid by the new notches he carves into his sheleghly or whatever it is.) Nobody in the film is entirely admirable, although just about everyone is treacherous. A black orphanage is burned down during the draft riots but this eludes mention. Also, okay, this is about the poorest and most crime-ridden neighborhood in New York City. Day-Lewis is a butcher and Cameron Diaz is a hooker, but what kind of work do the others do? We don't see anyone making a living. We don't even hear them talk about it. To whom does Day-Lewis sell his lamb chops?None of that detracts from the power of the images we see on the screen, or from some of the superb performances, the least effective of which come from DeCaprio and Diaz. The film paints a moving portrait of near anarchy. We only get to see one or two cops and they're thoroughly corrupt. Nobody balks, no committee is formed to investigate, when a battle between street gangs leaves dozens dead. The street has its own code. Plus ca change.",6,6,8,30 November 2007
Windtalkers," Big, Noisy War Movie.
","It's big, splashy, flamboyant, and predictable, full of zooming and banging CGIs, laden with sentiment. John Woo, master of the guns-in-both-hands shoot out goes to war.Nicholas Cage is a Marine in World War II. He's assigned to keep an eye on Adam Beach, a Navaho Indian, who radios information to the rear using the language of the Dine to baffle the Japanese. The code he uses is worth more than Beach's life, so Cage's mission to to protect him as much as possible and to kill him if he is in danger of falling into Japanese hands.I don't want to go on too long about the plot because much of it is already familiar to anyone who's seen more than two or three recent movies about the war. Cage is up to his usual professional standards. Beach is likable, has a dazzling smile, and seems shy in front of the camera.Woo is a commercial hack, though. There is no artistry in him, only journeyman-level craftsmanship. The movie is filled with violence of every sort except sexual. Well, I'll give an example of what I mean.The Marines are advancing along the front lines when they start being hit by our own artillery shells. Cage and Beach manage to get hold of a radio set, call back, and have the shelling stopped. Then they ask that the target be shifted to a Japanese position. No sooner is the request made than Woo shows Marine howitzers banging out their shells. Quick cut to Japanese positions. They immediately blow up in showers of debris and gore.Compare this, if you will, with a similar scene in Terence Malick's failed but sensitive 'The Thin Red Line.' A Japanese bunker on a hilltop half a mile away. The men call for some artillery. Long, silent pause. The men wait tensely. Then there is the slow, hushed whine of shells passing overhead, followed by several explosions of dirt on the still-distant crest. That's it. No close ups. No huge fireballs. No ear-shattering howitzers. And the passage of real time. Malick's movie didn't make the basket but at least the director was TRYING to do something with a little poetry.Woo is not. Every other scene involves some sort of cliché. Most of the deaths are in slow motion. (Ho hum, since 1968.) A grenade doesn't just pop off stunningly. It releases still another outsized fireball. It's the kind of grenade that, all by itself, can blow apart a building, destroy a tank, demolish New York City. The weapons rarely need reloading. (Reloading takes time and slows down the action.) Cage fires a Thompson submachine gun one handed, holding it like a pistol. If Cage had had TWO Thompsons, Woo would surely have had him firing one in each hand at hip level, just like John Travolta. There is the Texas redneck who beats up Indians cause they look like Japs to him. He changes his mind in the obbligato.Is a sympathetic Marine ever forced to kill one of his Navaho buddies in order to keep the code from the enemy? Are you kidding?Ya-ta-hay, natani. There's undoubtedly a compelling story of you Navaho Windtalkers out there somewhere, though I doubt that you were ever forced to hang your naked behinds out on the line as members of a rifle squad. That movie about your efforts has yet to be made.",2,1,3,8 October 2009
True Romance," Swift, Gory, Amusing.
","Don't be misled by the title. It's true that the central couple -- Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette -- are in love. There's never any doubt about it, though, so we don't have too many domestic disputes, no anguish over whether the two will find spiritual fulfillment in one another, no tearful complaints from the wife that the husband is married to his career, nothing cute at all, as a matter of fact. Adequate support is provided by Bronson Pinchot and a couple of others, including several one-day walk ons by figures you'll recognize at once.In possession of half a million bucks worth of cocaine, which they are willing to part with for half that amount, just to avoid the hassle of cutting it and selling it, Slater and Arquette take off for Hollywoodland where, as everyone knows, the cocaine is as ubiquitous as the car exhaust. The mob, however, does not approve of Slater's absconding with their 'cola' and are in pursuit, at the end of which they (and the cops too) catch up with the couple during a deal with a Hollywood mogul surrounded by well-armed gentlemen. The Hollywood goons shoot at the mob, the mob shoots at the goons, and the police shoot at everybody. The air is filled with feathers from exploded pillows as Arquette and the wounded Slater sneak out and head for Mexico.It's funny, but it's a pretty gory movie too. James Gandolfini shows up at Arquette's apartment and demands to know where the coke is. Arquette can't stop giggling as she tells him that there's a Coke machine at the end of the hall. She giggles through howls of pain even as he beats her to a pulp and throws her through walls. She winds up a bloody mess. It would be nice if professional make up personnel would remember that blood in the open coagulates and turns dark after half an hour. Here, as elsewhere, it's vermilion throughout.Despite the tumult, it's amusing. At times the dialog reaches for the keen. Maybe the funniest role is Brad Pitt's, as a stoned roommate of one of the lesser figures. Faced with a shotgun, he decides it would be better to withdraw his offer of a hit from his bong.",6,0,1,29 October 2017
Her," Yes, But Will He COMMIT?
","Los Angeles in a not-too-distant future in which life goes on much as it does today but with less smog and far more advanced technology. The art direction is exceptional. A précis of the plot would look like the outline for a Bill Murray comedy. Joaquin Phoenix, a writer and nerd, plugs into an 'operating system' that is his alone. The OS's voice is that of Scarlett Johansson. There is no mistaking that husky chuckle. Her name is Samantha and she has access to everything on Phoenix's hard drive. Further, he doesn't need to play around with keyboards. He communicates with her, and she with him, through a small earplug. And he has a miniature camera, tucked in his pocket or at his bed side, so Johansson can see what he's looking at and comment on it. After a moment of disbelief, his few friends accept the arrangement. He brings Samantha along on a double date so the four of them can chat and play games together.Phoenix has been recently divorced. It was the kind of divorce known as 'amicable', not like my divorce, which was 'unamicable', although my last divorce had less physical dimension than my first two. Johansson, from the beginning, is chipper and efficient, a great secretary who does what she's told and provides useful commentary. She even organizes some of his writing, without telling him, and sends it to an agreeable publisher.Phoenix and Johansson's voice fall in love, what else? They have a kind of cyber sex. She becomes as horny as he is. They tell each other jokes and form a mutual adoration society.But Phoenix has a problem. He's an uneasy introvert and doesn't want to commit himself to a relationship, so while she's experiencing emotions for the first time and blooming like a morning glory, he's beginning to wonder if it's such a hot idea to fall in love with his laptop.By now, she's sensitive to his moods and his tone of voice. 'Is there something wrong? We haven't had sex lately.' His reply is typically masculine. 'Oh, you know how it is. I've been busy lately, and every relationship has its honeymoon period.' Phoenix gets more uneasy, and Johansson more puzzled and demanding. 'What the F*** is WRONG with you!' I was terribly disturbed by the use of the F Bomb. Everybody seems to fling the word about in this movie, men and women alike. Is this what the future is going to be? Why, when I was a young feller a-sparkin' a gal, nobody cussed, not even the boys, not even the D word or the H word. Why, I swan, when I was a chile, we didn't even know what the F Bomb MEANT. We thunk it had something to do with sheep.I'm making the film sound funnier that it is, though it has its comic moments. It's really pretty melancholy in tone because, although they love each other, Johansson has come to have feelings that include others as well as Phoenix. It's harder for him to get in touch with her. While she used to be his alone, she now multi-tasks and has thousands of others to deal with. On top of that, some fanatical groups have begun to reconstruct real historical figures that now occupy the same cybernetic space as Johansson. The first hint that Phoenix gets of all this is when Johansson introduces him to the silky baritone of Alan Watts. (Kids, you'll have to Google Alan Watts. Google Gregory Bateson while you're at it.) Phoenix is naturally jealous and deeply disappointed. Johansson is the only woman -- or rather Operating System -- that he's ever really loved and now she's drifting away, although she still loves him, arguing that just because she loves others doesn't mean that she doesn't love him too. (I've heard a similar argument made about God.) By the end, Johansson has expanded and become part of a different kind of universe, an intangible and impalpable ether, rather like the hero of 'The Incredible Shrinking Man.' This may be hard to believe but there are some effective and touching moments in the evolution of their affair, as the enact what must be a common human emotional trajectory. Really, you can sense Johansson's desperation and Phoenix's growing loneliness as the distance between them grows.Spike Jonze, who wrote and directed it, has made a truly original film. It's only noticeable weakness is a tendency for the dialog to drop to the level of some afternoon soap opera. 'I apologize for not being there for you, and for all the responsibilities I put upon you.' That sort of thing, a little of which goes a long long way.Phoenix is pretty good in the central role. He certainly LOOKS the part with his tentative mustache and rimmed glasses. Sometimes his lines come out in a mumble that's not easy to translate. His best role was that of the incredibly stupid high school kid in 'To Die For.' Here, he gets matched up with four or five accessible women, all of them good looking, including Johansson, Olivia Wilde, and Amy Adams. It's a thought-provoking film. The thought it provokes is: 'Where do I get one of these Operating Systems?'",7,1,3,16 January 2015
The Nice Guys," Mismatched Pair.
","Crowe is a rough hit man and Gosling is a washed-out young private eye, father to adolescent Angerie Rice. They wind up searching for a porno star who has evidence that the auto industry is deliberately lying about polluting the air in Los Angeles. The MacGuffin is a reel of porno film that has the recorded evidence of the conspiracy spliced into its midsection. Something like that.What it boils down to is a lot of chases on foot and in cars, considerable blood letting, and a Mount Everest of wisecracks, mostly of the Rated-R quality. The whole production, set in Los Angeles, is colorful and wacky because the time is the early 70s. Terms like 'reefer' and 'Mary Jane' are flung about with abandon and we get to listen to the Strawberry Orange Peel or whatever the band was.If you intend to enjoy this film, it's best to follow the advice of the Roman philosopher Seneca and not expect too much, so you won't be disappointed by some of the rheumatic gags. As the film opens we see Goslings hungover face in the bath tub. When he tumbles out, we see he's wearing a suit. It was hilarious in 'Some Like It Hot.' The film achieves its goal, which is undemanding amusement. Gosling becomes Lou Costello to Crowe's Bud Abott. Rice is Gosling's thirteen-year-old blonde, blue-eyed daughter. She's extremely pretty and delivers a nice performance. It may also be Gosling's best. It's nice to see him as a comic loser rather than a cocky young man. Crowe is now bulky, lumpy, and fearsome as ever.Well, LA WAS pretty polluted back in the early 70s. It's much better now, whereas China, whose families have switched from using the methane from pig dropping as cooking fuel, to coal, has become far worse. If you're in a Chinese city, you may not be able to see the end of the block. However, they are aware of the problem and struggling with it. It's a serious problem but we'll have to bracket that thought in order to enjoy the laughs.",6,1,3,1 June 2017
Hacksaw Ridge," Command Pressure.
","Director Mel Gibson has produced a nifty story of a small-town religious boy, Andrew Garfield, who enlists in the army, is ridiculed and beaten by his cohort because he refuses to carry a rifle, but nevertheless achieves heroic stature on Okinawa by becoming a medic, staying behind and saving several dozen wounded soldiers, alone, unarmed, and in grave danger every moment.Garfield delivers in the principal role. He LOOKS like a small-town religious boy with his overgrown thatch of hair, small stature, and vacuous grin. His support varies. One or two of the dilatory suits are pretty ugly folks.Gibson is unable to avoid several clichés. The slow motion deaths are particularly distracting. I blame Kurosawa for first using it in 'Seven Samurai,' Arthur Penn for using it with relish in 'Bonny and Clyde', and Sam Pekinpah for going stratospheric with it in 'The Wild Bunch.' Several incidents are lifted from 'Saving Private Ryan.' It's very gory too but maybe that befits a story about an intrepid medic. I notice the shattered bodies have been criticized by some other reviewers but, according to memoirs by combat veterans like Paul Fusell and William Manchester, that's what a battlefield looks like. Not just dead bodies but parts of dead bodies as well.There's an ominous element in all that blood though. Perhaps the most tense and frightening scene of combat in World War II appeared in 'Pride of the Marines.' Three men manning a machine gun at the Battle of the Tenaru River on Guadalcanal, one shot dead and the other two wounded severely, and not a drop of blood is shown. Very little blood in 'Platoon' either. Not until 'Saving Private Ryan' are we treated to death up close and butchery galore. This one tops 'Saving Private Ryan.' I hope we're not on one of those treadmills where directors try to out-do one another in bloodiness.But anyway this is a believable and compelling true story of a guy who went overboard in doing just the opposite of what warriors are supposed to do. Good on him, as the Aussies would say.",6,1,3,24 July 2017
Gladiator," Alpha Males
","The emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris) is murdered by his son Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix). Aurelius's designated successor, General Maximus (Russel Crowe) is betrayed, becomes a slave, a gladiator, finally a the most popular gladiator in Rome, and kills Commodus before he himself drops dead of an unfair wound. Rome is turned over to Senator Grachus and is saved. Commodus's sister (Connie Nielson) has a son who will become the next emperor. Actually, that happy return to a Republic is tacked on, isn't it? Dictatorships continued till the end.I kept trying to figure out just what elements distinguished 'Gladiator' from the earlier sun and sandal epics of the 1950s, like 'Herculus,' usually starring some beefed-up parody of a male figure like Steve Reeves, or 'Ben Hur' for that matter.Obviously 'Gladiator' is more expensive and the special effects more especially effective. And, thank God, unlike Steve Reeves' epics the movie isn't dubbed, so nobody sounds like Orson Welles gargling.'Gladiator' is darker all around than almost all earlier movies of the period. Cinecitta was always so sunny and its weather so balmy. There's a moment near the beginning of 'Ben Hur' when Judah and Massala meet and Massala removes his decorative metal cuirass and reveals the soft scarlet cloth beneath it. It's a neat splash of color. There's nothing like that in 'Gladiator.' The Romans all wear dark clothing, usually black. And their armor is spiky-looking and abrasive, as if influenced by some video game or by Dungeons and Dragons. I guess the Senate wears white but even their robes are drained of brightness, so that they resemble the sheets that my laundry dryer produces. And sometimes it's cold too. Snow falls and the Romans wear fur robes. Pretty ugly stuff.The dialog isn't dubbed but the Foley artists have been hard at work generating the expectable clichés. No sword can be drawn without the slick sound of sharp metal against metal. And God forbid that a sword be thrown through the air without going whoo-whoo-whoo. If one of these behemoths swings his weapon it's invariably accompanied by a swoosh or a wheeesh. I don't know why. It doesn't make the motion more compelling in any way. It's a distraction because somewhere in the viewer's mind there must be the realization that if you swing a piece of metal through the air, it simply does not swoosh. The sounds of battle aren't the only clichés. The 'thumbs down/ thumbs up' business for death and life was, I think, borrowed from an improvisation in a Cecil B. DeMille movie, not from the historical record.Award for best performance: Richard Harris (his last movie) as Marcus Aurelius, the emperor who is at least as well known for his philosophy -- he was a stoic -- as for his martial exploits. Imagine -- a head of state who can have an original thought? 'Death smiles at all of us and all we can do is smile back.' Award for best-looking and most succulent actress: Connie Nielson. She couldn't be better. I don't know about her performance but she looks absolutely right for the part of the bitter widow, abused by her own brother, hopelessly in love with a man she'll never have. She's beautiful, sensuous, elegant, and as cold as polished steel.Best imitation of Steve Reeves: Russel Crowe, he of the enormous trapezii. I wouldn't want to get in the arena with that guy. His performance? Well -- he tries to laugh at one point.Best bad guy: Joaquin Phoenix isn't bad as the evil, cowardly, deceitful Commodus. It wouldn't surprise me to find that he had an amphora stuffed with ladies' lingerie. I'll give him a pass on insisting on incest, inasmuch as Connie Nielson is the victimized party. But, man, what a creep; no longer the teen age beauty, slightly more plump, and with a thicker voice.Is it worth seeing? Well, of course! Could anything on which so much expense had been lavished NOT be worth seeing? And it's thought provoking too. The thought it provokes is: what is it in human nature that prompts us to watch innocent others suffer and die violently? No? You don't have to look long on the internet to find video clips with titles like 'Iraqi gets blown up,' or 'Marine has arm shot off!' We can smugly dismiss 'the mob' of Romans for their barbaric tastes but we can't pass a highway accident without looking for some mangled limbs. Hell, we revel in it.",6,2,7,1 June 2007
Contact," Where Angels Don't Fear to Tread.
","The film, which isn't a bad one, is so packed with ideas that I'm going to skip the probably familiar plot and just make a few comments. Otherwise we're going to run out of space.What kind of names are we dealing with here? Is it Carl Sagan's idea of goyim naches that WASP parents go about giving their little baby boys and girls names like 'Palmer Joss'? And 'Ellie ARROWAY'? I have it on good authority -- just having made it up -- that in the entire four-million-year history of the human race, nobody has EVER been named Palmer Joss or Ellie Arroway! The film is about a government project that is shut down to cut funds for non-utilitarian research. When it's privately funded, Foster takes over. When they get results, the government bureaucracy arrogantly moves in again, with James Woods muttering darkly about 'militarization' of the program. Now 'military' is a dirty word in this context. We've already seen bulky generals sporting lots of stars. We've seen armed men diffuse throughout the SETI station when the news of the signal gets out. Playing the militarization card is a cheap shot at a stereotyped and convenient target. (Yet it's impossible to imagine its not happening.) One-dimensional characters. Foster = lonely, breathlessly idealistic scientist. McCaughnehy = New Age soul looking for theological 'meanings' behind events. John Hurt = sinister-looking Howard-Hughes billionaire operating underground. (My supporting player in the cult hit, 'From the Hip.') James Woods = obstacle in Foster's life space designed only to object to everything she wants to do, for political reasons. Tom Skerrit = manipulative, ambitious, egocentric bureaucrat whose name ('Drumlin') means a small hill. President Clinton, Forrest-Gumped into the movie, is bland and speaks in generalities so nebulous that not even Vegans could guess what the hell he's getting at. But this is the way a politician speaks, and he's believable. I even believed Clinton when he said, 'I did not have sexual relations with that woman.' Of course his definition of 'sexual relations' may be a little ideosyncratic, like mine. Mine involves handcuffs and fettucine.Jodie Foster, as Ellie Arroway, whom most people address as 'Doctor' but whom a simian politician (Rob Lowe) calls 'Miss.' The selection committee asks her, as one of the candidates for interplanetary travel, 'Do you believe in God?', and she comes up with some bumbling response about trusting data. Why did she bother to tell the truth? It never stopped our astronauts, who lied blithely about believing in God and going to church regularly. Anyway she could have copped out with some baloney about, yes, she believed in a kind of God like Spinoza's, who expressed himself or herself in physical laws. By the way, the interrogator who says that 95 percent of the world's people believe in a Supreme Being is full of malarkey. Using E. B. Tylor's 'minimal definition of religion,' a belief in supernatural spirits, we can say that all cultures have a religion, but not all of them have what we would recognize as a Supreme Being. Does Buddhism have a Supreme Being? What's He like? Is Zero a God? The movie raises the question of what would happen if two cultures with very different values came into contact with one another. It's an interesting question. As Arnold Toynbee has observed, it's happened before, when European adventurers first began landing on the soil of the New World. Those settlers devoutly believed in both God and Gold, to the extent that they could distinguish between them. We can at least hope for better results when we go to Vega.Jodie Foster is the central figure of course. Her features are sharp and sleek like a shark's so they are almost a little scary, but her talent is such that she's able to project a full range of emotions, both blatant and subtle, and the viewer is able to make contact with her.One final thought. After watching the expectable computer-generated climactic special effects, the thought came to me unbidden that no power on earth could get me to set foot on that contraption.I miss Carl Sagan a lot. He was a genuinely nice guy who had the grace and good sense not to drop into my comprehensive exams when they were in fact open to any member of the faculty. His enthusiasm for the objects of his study were catching, in the way the flu is catching. Billions and billions of moons and galaxies. I hope he's now at home somewhere among them.",7,1,4,19 April 2007
Born on the Fourth of July," What's New?
","I've tried to get through this several times and always find my attention drifting -- when I'm not being a little irritated.Basically, Oliver Stone's movie is telling me things I already know, and it's telling them to me in a way that suggests I never knew them before. I don't know about anyone else but I resent it when a director assumes I'm stupid. Flawed, yes. Perverse and debauched even, but not stupid.And I find I'm also compelled to wonder about the sources for some of these events. The Mexican whores are infinitely believable but the rats in the VA hospital are not. The VA has been my primary health care provider for years and the facilities are clean as a whistle, although things may have changed considerably since the flood of wounded that were returned from Vietnam.These irritants interfere with my appreciation of the movie itself, which is far more coherent than much of Stone's other work, especially the hallucinatory 'JFK.'Stone is intelligent and a man of principle but he ought to watch himself otherwise he's in danger of becoming another Allan Dershowitz. If the authorities say it's so, it isn't so.",6,0,2,13 May 2012
Back to the Future," Amusing and commercial success.
","Good-natured and enjoyable fantasy about Michael J. Fox (as Marty McFly) who travels 30 years into the past with the help of Dr. Brown (Christopher Lloyd) and his magic, plutonium-powered DeLorean.The present -- that is, 1985 -- is a bit of a mess in Fox's small town. What's left of the downtown area is surrounded by strip malls. The two movie theaters are defunct. One has been converted into an evangelical church and the other shows X-rated movies. Homeless bums sleep on the benches of the town square. Fox's mother (Lea Thompson) is an overweight, hopeless alcoholic; his father is a witless nobody constantly abused by a burly friend who exploits him and then insults him for his imperfect efforts.Lloyd is a maniacal scientist who steals plutonium from Lebanese terrorists to fuel his traveling time machine. He's shot by them as Fox barely escapes, zooming into the past.It's 1955 now and we note that the state of the town is rather better in most respects. No garbage on the streets. No suburbs, but farmland 'as far as the eye can see.' A couple of good gags follow, right out of 'The Twilight Zone.' Pull into a gas station and half a dozen employees rush out to service your car. A cup of coffee is five cents. When Fox orders a Tab in the diner, the counter man doesn't know what he's talking about. A 'Pepsi free' doesn't help.But there are of course the kind of complications that usually follow from time travel. Fox meets his own mother and father, as well as Dr. Brown. The problem is that Fox's mother gets the hots for him and Fox must arrange for his own father to take his place in her affection. In brief, he does so, successfully travels back to 1985, and finds Dr. Brown has paid attention to a warning and worn a bullet-proof vest so he survives the terrorist shooting.I enjoy seeing it once in a while and I gather it was immensely popular. There's just enough profanity to pep things up and keep this from being a movie for children. The plot itself isn't challenging in any way, though some of the gags require a certain maturity to be understood. Someone asks who is president in 1985. 'Ronald Regan? The actor? Who's vice president -- Jerry Lewis?' Fox is a convincing high-schooler and easy to identify with. Christopher Lloyd is overly manic and with his bulging eyes resembles a creature out of the very depths of the ocean. Lea Thompson doesn't add much, but Chrispin Glover as Fox's father seems all flapping arms and legs.I think it might have been more enjoyable if the anachronisms had been spread throughout the movie instead of being all crowded into the first ten minutes or so of the 1955 period. Some of the comedy was thrown away in the interests of special-effects and pseudo-drama. (Think of 'Groundhog Day,' in which all the elements are seamlessly blended.) And it also appears that McFly adapts too readily to 1955. After the first few minutes, nothing surprises him. He takes this extraordinary experience for granted and simply goes about the business of bringing his parents together and figuring out a way to get back to his real 'present' before his picture disappears from the snapshot he's brought along with him. (?) I'd have been taking notes every minute. A few liberties are also taken with the norms of 1955. Good girls, like Lea Thompson, didn't reach under the table to squeeze a stranger's thigh. At least none of them did that with me. And if theywouldn't have done it with me, they obviously wouldn't have done it to anyone. Except -- and this is probably the answer -- Lea Thompson was a slut to begin with. Yes, that must be it. How disgusting.Anyway, you'll have fun watching the film. The kids will too. It generated three sequels, none of which I've watched.",6,7,21,20 May 2008

There are one or two allusions to being a 'made man' but the words 'Mafia' and 'Cosa Nostra' never appear, though all the main figures are Italian, observe Italian moral codes, and occasionally lapse into the language of the Old Country. If you really want to be a member of the Goodfellas, it's not enough to be simply part Italian. You need to be ALL Italian, with traceable ancestry to the motherland, preferably Sicily.Everyone except some Federal Agents are corrupt. The wives know what's going on and are often complicit, though they have little to say about business decisions. They're satisfied with the solidarity of the larger family, the special parking places, the secret entrances to the Copacabana, the respect shown themselves and their well-groomed husbands, and the general opulence of their life styles. The girl friends enjoy many of the same privileges but are mainly the subject of jokes, which wives and children are not. Well, some are Madonnas and some are whores.The cops are partners in crime, whether the gangsters are on the streets or in prison. They become your major domos for a few cartons of cigarettes and an occasional big bill tucked into a shirt pocket. Your first jail term turns into a rite of passage, and you're given a celebration before you're packed off. The men clap and cry out 'Your cherry is broke now.' Prison itself is not a bad place if you're a wise guy. No one would dream of trying to rape you. You live with friends and share elaborate dinners and good wines with them.There are only two problems; one is interactional, the other moral and economic.As for the interactional problem, you can never really tell whether someone will become a 'rat,' not even if you've known him all your life. From the point of view of a protagonist like Henry Hill, whose story this is, it's very bad to be a rat instead of a stand-up guy. On the other hand, it's much better to be a rat instead of a dead guy. Severe beatings are common, even for men who are no more than irritating or even for innocents like mailmen. And when an important deal is at stake, whacking is necessary.Whacking is also applied to men who unwisely insult others, because this is a culture of honor. It's like the Old West without Wyatt Earp. 'When you call me that, smile.' And sometimes smiling isn't enough. The derision must be clearly couched. Half a couch may not do. Personal affronts call for a passionate butchery, but business transactions are cold blooded and maximally effective.This social system is real enough. In certain bars in New York and New Jersey I was unwise enough to make some joke about Mafia hangouts and received warnings. And in Little Charlie's Restaurant on Kenmare Street in Little Italy, two tables were always kept empty in case some local businessmen decided to drop in unannounced.The movie is told from Henry Hill's (Ray Liotta's) point of view and he narrates most of it. Hill was half Irish and married a Jewish girl but was accepted, within certain limitations. That brings up the moral questions built into the film. These guys are friendly and generous to each other. But who pay for all that reckless spending? You and I. The gang isn't a charitable organization. Every time we buy something or rent an apartment, it costs a little more because of them, and they contribute nothing except mutual support.It's an immoral subculture in which the goals of society -- respect, wealth, material satisfaction, friendship -- are accepted, but society's means of achieving those goals -- following the rules, upholding the law, respecting the rights of strangers -- are rejected. The sociologist Robert K. Merton called them 'innovators' and that's what they are. They invent and follow illegal rules for achieving society's goals. From an ethical perspective, it's a much better story than Francis Ford Coppola's 'The Godfather' series, which was an apologia for the Mafia, portrayed as a neighborhood organization that simply fills certain control functions that the regular police will or can not. No one was killed in 'The Godfather' unless he was a coward and a traitor and deserved it. In 'Goodfellas', a kid gets shot through the foot for being slow in delivering drinks to a table, and the incident is treated as a stupid joke. No one even TRIES justifying the act. When the same kid is later slaughtered for a resentful remark, the dead body is treated as a nuisance.The acting is unimpeachable, and so is the production design. You can almost smell the cigars, the perfume, the marinara sauce cooking in the large pot on the stove. (Everybody eats a lot in this movie.) You should definitely see it if you haven't already. It's naturalism is convincing and there is no Marlon Brando to sympathize with.",8,2,3,26 July 2012
The Bourne Supremacy," Stillbirth.
","Few sequels are as good as the original, but this one is really pretty bad, distilling out of the first version everything that was good and simply throwing it away, then adding some stuff that makes it almost impossible to watch..Take the title. 'The Bourne Identity' actually had meaning. There was a question driving the movie -- just who IS this amnesic guy? Even the name 'Bourne' added a bit of symbolic weight. This one is called 'The Bourne Supremacy.' Supremacy in what endeavor? And why supremacy? Why not just superiority? Or even equality? 'The Bourne Equality?' I guess not.No one could fault the performers, who in other environments have been more than adequate. Matt Damon was good as Mister Ripley, and superb as the guilt-ridden junkie in 'Courage Under Fire.' Joan Allen, as always, projects a curious but appealing mixture of fortitude and femininity. Nobody else in the movie counts for much.The plot is more or less dismissible. Bourne is set up and then pursued by some corrupt inner circle of CIA officials and Russians. It has something to do with the privatization of Russian oil, but it all boils down to one long chase.What really dismembers the movie is the direction and the editing. If you can imagine Oliver Stone on meth, you'll get the general picture.There is, first, a terrible imposition of directorial self display during some scenes. A blurry step-motion murder. A zapped up memory flashback in negative. But that in itself wouldn't be so awful. The problem is that it never stops.The camera seems to be ataxic. I can't remember a single scene in which it held still. It wobbles pointlessly all over the place or it focuses on some unimportant object like a venetian blind while the action takes place elsewhere, as if the director had been weaned on MTV or one of those TV commercials for a brokerage firm or a toothpaste whitener. ('I was afraid to smile in public until I discovered Dentabrite with Endorphin.') Let me give an example. Jason Bourne is doing some library research. He's reading microfiche of newspaper items in Russian and English and turns up some important information. The camera shows us the articles and the associated photographs -- but it WOBBLES so we can't read anything. There are dozens of ways of giving a viewer the gist of a story without asking him or her to read the details of the article. Erroll Morris showed us one effective way -- just hold the camera on the header. But this aimless wavering is positively irritating.The editing is equally poor. Every change of scene seems to be a cut, not a dissolve. And the cuts come fast and thick -- say every few seconds. Objects zoom aimlessly in and out of focus. And the director is given to lightning-quick pans, often past unidentifiable dark objects.If the direction and editing are a major problem during most of the movie, they turn into insurmountable obstacles during action scenes. A furious mano a mano shows us one-second glimpses of a fist here, a foot there, a knife skittering along the floor, a window breaking. The obligatory car chase comes towards the end, with the possible novelty of having been actually filmed in the gray streets and tunnels of Moscow, but the promise is unfulfilled. Each shot lasts a second or so and gives us mostly details -- Bourne's grimace at the wheel of his speeding taxi, a pistol being fired by somebody whose identity we must guess, cars chasing cars chasing cars chasing a car -- the movie should have been called 'Chasing Sanbourne.' (That was a wretched play on words. Can I take it back?) You know why the original 'Bourne Identity' was above average, at least in my humble opinion? It had a better plot, for one thing. We were as interested as Bourne himself in finding his identity. For another thing, it had a developing relationship between Bourne and the girl (Famke Potente) whose car he hires. For another, there was violence, but it was not done to the viewer. The fights were unexpected, brutal, and staged in such a way that we could follow the events. And finally, the original gave us a chance to breathe between the zaps, an opportunity to learn something about the characters and their situations, about the kinds of music they listen to on a car radio.All of that -- and more -- is missing from this meretricious attempt to make a few bucks by tapping into the inelastic demand of an audience of viewers whose heads are as empty as their intolerance of boredom is great. I don't mean to cast aspersions on people who may have enjoyed this movie more than I did, just on the people who assembled it with that audience in mind.",1,10,28,12 June 2005
The Great Gatsby," A Glitzier Gatsby.
","It's time to start wondering if they ought to leave great or even near-great novels alone. No matter how hard they try, they simply can't capture 'Lolita' on the screen, or 'The Great Gatsby.' Joseph Strick once took a stab at 'Ulysses.' You ought to see it.I had to read 'The Great Gatsby' in high school and didn't get much out of it. It was an ordinary love story and rather boring. I preferred Jack London and Stephen Crane. But I was much younger then and my brain was smaller, unable to encompass the theme of lost and broken promise.Paramount turned out a version of the story with Alan Ladd as a rich guy, but it was all lovey-dovey until the murder at the end. A handsome Robert Redford and a wan Mia Farrow took a stab at it in 1975, probably the most nearly successful attempt.But a generation has passed and it's time for another crack at it. The director, Baz Luhrmann, apparently believes that the previous versions were too slow and colorless, didn't have enough violence, and had no access to computer generated images. Boy, does he believe it.The camera whooshes all over the place. There are Busby Berkeley shots from overhead. It caroms off the walls of New York City streets. It's fast. And the sound track is loud. Some of the musical score -- whether source music or overscore, and sometimes it's impossible to tell one from another -- are of the period. During Gatsby's increasingly public courting of Daisy, 'Ain't Misbehaving' slides into 'Let's Misbehave.' But that kind of musical echo is uncommon. It's 1926 and the bands play rap music while the camera takes a tour of Times Square. Later there is a disco dance scene with the appropriate beats. The bands never seem to shut up. It's pretty jarring, whereas the Redford version, though sluggish in comparison, at least stuck to lush period tunes like 'What'll I Do?'.Carey Mulligan, as Daisy, doesn't look bewitching but that's okay. She handles the part well, and after all the point isn't that Daisy is such a terrific knockout. It's that she's got some men in her thrall, mostly through her appealing delicacy and whatever pheromones she's flinging around.Hers is probably the best example of casting and acting. Tobey Maguire is the narrator and observer, Nick. (Quick -- name a seed you put in the garage! Sorry. I had to get that in. It's from a crossword puzzle in the London Times, invented by a sadist. The answer is 'Caraway', a homonym for Nick's last name.) Poor Maguire. He does what he can with the part but is awfully miscast. Let's face it. Maguire wasn't born to play Nick Carraway. He takes a leap at the role but winds up as Mister Peepers. His occasional narration is given in a weary croak. The writers have sent him to a psychiatric institution after the storm of crap he's been through. He does get to quote some of the more impressive lines of the novel. ('Blue gardens,' etc.) Tom Buchanan, Joel Edgerton, looks brutal enough, more than Bruce Dern did. He's more physical and just as dumb. But Dern could have passed for a Yale man, whereas Edgerton looks like he was a feral child raised by wolves.Leonardo DiCaprio gives it everything he has, maybe too much. The director must have egged him on. He uses the same intonations he did in 'J. Edgar.' He'd have probably been better off with a phony English accent to go along with the rest of his fictional history. And if Fitzgerald's Gatsby is nervous when he meets Daisy in that rosy picture-postcard cottage, DiCaprio is a complete neural shambles, drenched with sweat, knocking over furniture. It gets the point across at least as well as a crowbar across the head.Most of all, what's missing from all of these adaptations is Fitzgerald's sly humor. When Daisy and Tom first come to one of Gatsby's soirées, Fitzgerald gives all of the guests the names of obscure animals, all in a long list. ('The Wildebeests from Cincinnati, the Dik-Diks, Professor Margay of Dartmouth, the Elands of Hollywood fame,' and so forth. Those aren't direct quotes.) The movie is a long and glorious pageant of color that almost swamps Gatsby. Maybe next time.",6,2,3,19 March 2014
The Proposal," Unimaginative Romantic Comedy.
","Sandra Bullock is some editor at a tony publishing house and Ryan Reynolds is her assistant who 'loves her from afar.' A few simple mistakes by Bullock during a visit to Frankfurt and she is threatened with deportation to her native Canada -- unless she marries an American citizen pronto. The significance of Ryan Reynolds rises. The immigration agency will be checking every detail of this possibly fraudulent marriage so everything must look kosher -- Reynolds' family in Alaska must have met the bride-to-be and so on.The elements of an amusing plot may be there but the inspiration isn't. Amusing incidents aren't that amusing. The dialog says nothing remotely memorable. The scenes slow down for laughter but little is likely to be forthcoming.Here's an example. After Reynolds drags Bullock off to Sitka to meet the family, we have the mismatch between the city mouse and the country mouse. She's wearing heels and has to climb down a ladder in order to enter a boat. It seems to take forever, while the boat crew watch her waving her shoe around, searching for the next lower rung. 'I'll help you,' says Reynolds from below, placing a hand on one of her buns. 'Hand off ass,' snaps Bullock.The whole affair is pretty predictable. (I'll let the experienced viewer guess the ending.) Award for most engaging personality and best performance goes to Betty White, who must be in her late 80s and can still cause a grin. Introduced to Bullock, whose character's name is Margaret, White asks with a welcoming grin: 'Do you prefer being called Margaret or Andrew's mistress?' It may be the funniest line in the movie, and one of its rare successes.",4,3,4,17 October 2013
The Birds," Pacific Flyway.
","A Hitchcockian epic! It's one of his big movies with sweeping location shooting and a major theme. Bodega Bay never looked so good, despite Susanne Pleshette's calling it a collection of shacks on a hillside. These shacks have character. They're all weathered from the salty fog and winter rain and, inside, you can practically smell the new paint. And the folks are right friendly too, willing to give you directions and make your phone calls for you. Oh, they may not be too sophisticated. Don't try to talk Robert Rauschenberg with them. But they're honest God-fearing sons of the soil and sea, so ordinary, so dull, that one day the tide may go out and never come back.Well, come to think of it, you might mention some fancy artist's name to Rod Taylor, the guy who spends his weekends with his possessive mother and younger sister on the family chicken farm. He might be able to argue with you about the virtues and weaknesses of Paul De Man, but probably not. He's a successful lawyer who lives two hours south of Bodega Bay in San Francisco. And he's a no-nonsense kind of guy who enjoys roughing it on the chicken ranch. He's a prize hunk, too. I mean, a well-to-do lawyer who is grounded, playful and loving at the same time. Even his work clothes look as if they were designed by some Hollywood wardrobe mistress, which they were.Tippi Hedren is a self-indulgent blond who takes a shine to Taylor and pursues him to Bodega Bay. In the village, she gets to meet and befriend Pleshette, an ex girl friend of Taylor's who is still hanging around town, working as the school teacher, though she knows it's all over between her and Taylor. Now, the savvy viewer, who knows that this movie is all about birds attacking and killing people, will recognize at once that Pleshette -- the despondent ex, the superfluous school marm -- doesn't have much of a future.It's a beautiful-looking movie, as I say, exquisitely photographed by Robert Burks. It's classically structured, with increasingly ominous threats followed by increasingly violent attacks. Rod Taylor is a comforting masculine presence. Jessica Tandy, as Taylor's mother, handles a complex role well and still looks gorgeous despite her age.Tippi Hedren is polished and glossy and clean to the point of sterility, looked at with the care an owner might lavish on his new Lamborghini. That's Hitchcock's doing.The poor woman was miscast and misdirected. She smirks a good deal and has these slight but noticeable tics that some attractive women use on screen that draws attention to this or that view of her features. All of that is Hitch's doing.Hitch 'discovered' her in a TV commercial, the kind of thing for which she is aptly suited, and treated her as his personal possession, figuring she should be grateful to him for turning her into a major movie star, as his own creation. He even had a legal requirement that quotation marks be put around her Scandinavian nickname, 'Tippi'. But Hitch's judgment was falling off. (It didn't help that he was pounding a lot of booze by this time.) He was always quietly dominant with his leading ladies but this tendency became excessive with Tippi Hedren, to the point at which his demands became intolerably vulgar. Hedren rejected him and after that Hitch put her through hell. When she is attacked by the birds in the attic, it was deliberate torture.The problem was all the more marked because, after all, Hedren is the central character and we witness events through her eyes. She has to carry the picture and she can't do it.Aside from Hedren, Hitch's footing seems uncertain and he falls back on clichés that he probably wouldn't have used ten years earlier. It's bad enough that the birds attack people, but that's what the whole ambiguous story is about. But that they should concentrate their attacks on helpless children? TWICE? And with multiple close ups of birds pecking away at the faces of the screaming kids? Hitch was always fond of shots that were both innovative and graceful -- a camera swooping slowly down a staircase, nudging its way through a partying crowd, and focusing at length on someone's hand half-hiding a critical key. He tries something innovative here -- a series of shock jump cuts bringing us closer and closer to the bloody orbital sockets of a man whose eyes have been pecked out. It doesn't work.In fact, the birds themselves don't work very well. I know sea gulls can bite. Their upper and lower bills each have two long rows of tiny saw-like teeth, as I know all too well. I don't know about crows. But I'm familiar with finches and sparrows. And they're harmless little seed eaters. When Taylor and his family are attacked by a horde of hundreds of fluttering sparrows and the viewer is supposed to feel the terror of the victims, I felt sorry for the poor birds.I gave this a reasonably good rating because it evokes small-town atmosphere so well and the photography is luscious. It's exciting on first viewing too. It's only later, when you think about it, that you realize that Hitchcock is losing his touch here -- and that's sadder than anything in the film.",7,1,5,3 October 2010
Sully," Brace For A Slight Impact.
","What can you say about a mild-mannered elderly pilot who in 128 seconds diagnosed the problem with his US Airways passenger jet, reviewed his options, and chose the only one available which, despite the dangers, was overcome by the mild-mannered elderly pilot's skill as a flier? Not a hell of a lot. You need to build a full-length feature film around a few minutes of extreme stress and ultimate catharsis. Captain Sullenberger was a hero who ditched his huge airplane in the middle of the Hudson River with none of his 153 passengers suffering more than a scratch or two. That was January of 2009, which prompts me to observe that time is beginning to fly almost as fast as an L-1011 these days.But how do you fill up the movie? In classical narratives you require a protagonist who's trying to accomplish something and an antagonist who's trying to stop him from getting it done, but there's nothing like that in Sully's story. Everyone did was he was supposed to do -- not just the captain but the co-pilot, the flight attendants, the passengers, and the first and second responders. Given the circumstances -- the loss of power over both engines because of a bird strike -- it could hardly have turned out better.In such circumstances you need to provide the audience with enough information to infer the non-existent antagonist. In this case, the targets were easy: the 'suits.' That would be the National Transportation Safety Board and the insurance companies who stand to lose a great deal of money. So the modest and unassuming Sully must be called before a board of inquiry that looks exactly like the setting of an appellate courtroom. The judges sit up there at the long bench, full of evidence, pomposity, cynicism, and authority, while looking down at Sully and the other prisoners, I mean witnesses, below. The judges aren't chosen for their beauty either. They frown a lot and use tones of voice that are ripe with innuendo.Does Sully come through this and all the stresses associated with celebrity victorious -- in one piece? Are you kidding? If he hadn't, there would be no movie. So the film fakes its heavies. It also lacks sufficient technical detail so that the audience can't follow with any accuracy just what it is that Sully and his first officer are doing during the emergency. The procedures aren't that complicated. The emergencies described in a TV series like 'Mayday' ('Air Crash') are laid out so that even a non-techie can follow them flawlessly. But that would require a narrator, and this isn't a story about technology. It's a story about one man -- Captain Chesley Sullenberger and his behavior under stress. The other characters, his first officer and even his wife, Laura Linney, are strictly ancillary. It's a character study and it's well played.On the surface it doesn't give star Tom Hanks much to do because Sully was quiet and always controlled. But there's the challenge. Hanks has to convey emotions with the slightest changes of his facial expressions, a slight squint, a barely perceptible smile, the blankness of a focused attention. As for his voice it never changes except for a few second while the airplane is gliding earthward, or rather waterward, and he has to speak to the Air Traffic Controllers because a shortage of time demands it.There's nothing spectacular about the film. The CGIs are modest. Nobody shrieks with anger or with terror. Everyone is respectful and polite. Hardly anyone sobs. And nobody's head gets wrenched out of its socket. Even the suits, sitting up there in all their grandeur, come around at the end and freely, apologetically, admit that Sully did exactly the right thing under existing conditions. He really DID too. The Airbus A-320 that he was flying was definitely not built with the prospect of a ditching in mind. The airplane has two big jet engines, one hanging low under each wing. The object in landing on water is to keep the airplane as level as possible because if it touches tail down, the nose will pitch forward forcefully and the stop will be abrupt and destructive. And of course if the pilot lands nose down, he's humped. But a smooth, level landing on water us almost impossible with two huge objects hanging from the wings. If the airplane isn't kept almost exactly level, one engine with catch the water sooner than the other, the airplane will spin around in the direction of the lowest engine and possibly disintegrate. Sully was lucky he was over the smooth Hudson River and not the open sea.Clint Eastwood has chosen to show the emergency landing in several disjointed flashbacks but we never lose track of events or of where we are. Sully is a very intelligent man, a highly skilled pilot and deserves his celebrity, however much he may or may not have wanted it. Generally, a nice job, a full-length film built around a few minutes of extreme danger that doesn't lose the viewer's interest.",6,1,1,30 May 2017
Cinderella Man," And a left -- and a right!
","I don't think the theme goes farther back than Lysistrata, about 400 BC. Women object to men's afición for combat and try to stop it.For forerunners of poor families drawn into boxing look for 'Body and Soul' and 'Rocky'. Yet, as a feel-good movie, as most of Ron Howard's are, it works -- in the sense that you feel good at the end. Want to draw two lessons from it? Have a devoted wife (a great performance by Zellwiger) and every dumb Irishman should have a smart Jewish manager. So as not to burden the viewer with the necessity of thought, the script shows us characters that are exclusively one dimensional. Braddock's probity is never in doubt. And Max Baer is thoroughly evil, along the lines of Mr. T in 'Rocky III.' No character ever changes or develops in any major way. What you see at first is what you get all the way through, although in those few scenes in which Crowe has to project some emotion, he delivers in the grand manner. The film even preaches that during the Great Depression, communism (or 'unionism') was wrong-headed. Braddock's socially engaged working-class pal gets run over by a horse-drawn wagon in a Hooverville. Braddock, who refuses to fight anything that he can't see, like 'the economy,' emerges victorious. That's the movie's political point of view, although the fact is, as every sensible person know, under capitalism man exploits man. Under communism it's just the opposite. There are two good things about it. One is the fight scenes, that resemble paintings by Bellows. The choreography hasn't much new to offer but at least it doesn't repeat shots that have now become clichés. Little in the way of slow motion. On the other hand, Howard is so anxious for the viewer not to overlook even the most obvious points that when Braddock has one or two ribs cracked during a bout, the director actually shows us a brief X-ray of the ribs! Does it resemble any previous sports movies? How could it not? Put 'The Rookie,' 'Rocky', and one or two others into a Waring blender and this is what you get. An entertaining, even gripping, thoroughly commercial fairy tale. Not that it's bad. It IS after all a feel-good movie. And the scenes of economic desolation are convincing. When my grandmother died my grandfather, an immigrant, was saddled with three kids, the oldest about 12, while working 12 hours a day including Saturdays. He farmed them out and chipped in as well as he could, just as in this movie. Those who think of those days as a golden age, before taxes and such social programs as LIHEAP, ought to rethink things.A second interesting point, though, is the stovepipe that sports provide into the wealthy class. It really worked for minorities. First Irish, then Italians and Jews, then blacks, then Latinos. Boxing, barbaric as it is, serves the same economic purpose as the military -- a way out of poverty.",4,2,6,24 June 2006
Jurassic Park," Some mean mothers --
","As a critic, Edgar Allan Poe had a simple theory of literary aesthetics. Throw logic out the window and go for the effect. Does it really MATTER why the guy is in a pitch-black room with a pit in the middle and a scythe swinging overhead? As a novelist Michael Crighton is too much the techie to ignore logic. He gives us a step-by-step recreation of the process by which dinosaurs can be resurrected. Then he throws in some kinds of his own. He has a juvenile T. rex finding a helpless human being that is about to become a meal. And the dinosaur plays with his victim, the way a cat plays with an injured mouse. A bit of a stretch because, unlike mammals, reptiles aren't known for their playfulness.Steven Spielberg's movie version of the novel is epic, heroic, monumental -- and big. Everything about it is big. The novel, grand enough in itself, seems to have exploded gloriously on the screen. And, the introductory explanation of dinosaur resurrection aside, it follows Poe's theory closely. One glitch in the system and the id is loosed on a dozen or so people in Jurassic Park, a kind of living Disneyland. (Attenborough: 'Nothing works perfectly the first time. When Disneyland was first opened nothing worked.' Goldblum: 'When The Pirates of the Caribbean stopped working, the pirates didn't eat the tourists.') After the glitch, similar to the one in Crighton's 'Westworld', the administrators and experts running the park have to do a lot of running themselves to escape the various man eaters. It was sharks in Spielberg's 'Jaws.' And, man, that must be one primeval fear. Everybody faces eventual dissolution, running out of telomeres, but being EATEN ALIVE is another matter. A common dream involves being chased by some unknown monstrous anthropophage while we seem to slog in slow motion through a pond of molasses.And people do get eaten in this movie. The first two of them are bad guys anyway, one an overweight, giggling industrial spy who is so stupid he tries to play 'fetch' with his pursuer. The other is 'a blood-sucking lawyer' who is snapped up while sitting on the john.The movie is one big set piece after another. It isn't possible to describe them all, and not necessary really, because if you can think of a suspenseful scene that might take place in this kind of narrative context, you'll find it here. There are innumerably cross-cuts between a catastrophe about to happen and someone elsewhere feverishly trying to prevent the catastrophe from happening. Chase scenes abound -- on open plains, among museum displays, in computer rooms, in cars, in large kitchens. Someone hollers to someone else who is threatened: 'Don't move! He can only see you if you MOVE!' The potential victim moves.A lot depends on special effects and CGI and they are splendid. The dinosaurs seem real enough, attended by appropriate sounds. (The sound man should get a medal.) Not just roars but chirps, whistles, the patter of heavy rain drops on Plexiglas, the thud of gigantic reptilian feet on earth. 'Impact tremors', observes Goldblum. The musical score never leaves us in doubt about what we are supposed to feel. The first sight of a couple of those towering beasts is accompanied by a heavenly choir. (A neon sign should be blinking, 'Awe'.) Spielberg lets his story and his imagination run wild and it carries you along. The whole family will be glued to the set. If the theme had been cheerier it could easily have been made by the old Walt Disney studio.A slight problem is that when you go for big effects you sometimes lose a little in the way of continuity. I mean, the fat guy playing 'fetch' with his killer, for instance. And then there are Sam O'Neill and the two kids, traipsing through the bush. They've just been attacked and almost killed by T. rex and they've seen a man eaten alive. So what do they do? They settle down and sleep for the night in the crook of a huge tree, smiling. When they see a couple of herbivorous animals with necks the size and shape of the Washington monument, O'Neill cheerfully begins to hoot at them to see if they will answer or -- better yet -- come to him and let the kids pet them. Right. The dinosaurs leave mists when they breathe on glass. Are they warm blooded? As I recall, their hearts have three and a half chambers or something. We see one of the little buggers hatch from her egg, and the egg tooth she should probably have is absent. There is some business about frog DNA having gotten mixed up with the dino DNA, so the dinos have become a greater threat because they are now able to reproduce. But they may not have needed the frogs because in modern reptiles parthenogenesis isn't uncommon. Where I live, we're surrounded by New Mexico whiptail lizards and every one of them is a female, just as in the movie. I don't know if they LIKE it, but that's the way it is. That's just carping though.There's a bit of philosophizing near the beginning. Is it right or wrong to resurrect dinosaurs. But the conversation doesn't lead anywhere, and I suppose it's just there to remind us not to fool Mother Nature -- as if we cared. The question is a real one. Is nature there only to be shaped to our utilitarian ends? Or is it better to live in harmony with our own ecosystem. That's a lot different from asking if it's right for elephants to have tusks, but the movie isn't interested in the issue because it might irritate our nervous systems. Better to stick with Poe.Fascinating movie. Spielberg has his fingers on the public pulse. Or his probes into our reptilian brains.",7,1,4,16 October 2006
Beetlejuice," Cute
","A house-owning couple (Baldwin and Davis) in New England are killed in an auto accident, but show up as fully fleshed ghosts confined to their old house. A new couple, the sculptress manquÃ© O'Hara and the real estate flipper Jones, buy the house, reshape its classic lines with egregious appurtenances, and throw out the old furniture and fill the house with post-modern junk -- and O'Hara's monstrous sculptures.The ghosts want to get rid of the new owners but can't seem to scare them, so they hire a rogue bio-exorcists named Beetlejuice (Keaton). Everything goes crazy.Well, that's the story, insofar as anyone can make out a story. It begins promisingly enough, diverting and funny, but the plot line gets lost and it turns into a special effects extravaganza.I wonder if, in 1988, computer-generated graphics were a polished device because they seem a little clumsy here sometimes -- as when Baldwin runs around holding his head in his hand.The characters are all well done though. Sylvia Sidney as Baldwin's and Davis' 'case worker' is a hoot. She plays it like an irritable New York Jew who inhales her cigarette smoke and exhales it through the fissure in her throat. Michael Keaton, my co-star in the superb artistic and commercial hit, 'The Squeeze', brings a vulgar kind of life to every scene he's in. The guy and the character are really animated. His head spins like a dredl, he turns into a dragon, and he does a television commercial advertising his skills, and it's a peerless parody of Cal Worthington and his auto dealership. Calvin Cooledge Worthington may be a more familiar name to those living in Southern California. You couldn't get away from him anymore than you could get away from a television set.That brief jibe is only one of several that are funny. 'Hell' turns out to be a garish, purple waiting room with revolting Musak and people who took a ticket and are waiting their turn, only the office is now serving Number Three and your ticket is in the millions. At an apt moment the music turns into the shrieking violins of 'Psycho,' though that's no longer very original.Alas, the story does wind up derailed, the eviction of the new tenants discarded, and what follows makes little sense. The incidents seem like an excuse for excess and aren't linked together by any sort of human logic.But when it rings the bell, it sparkles for a moment. Daughter Winona Ryder can't wake her mother up because 'she's sleeping with Prince Valium.'",6,0,1,5 January 2016
Valkyrie," Slow and Thorough.
","I'd hate to think my mind had been worn to a nubbin by exposure to headlong action movies with exploding fireballs every few minutes and impossible physical feats generated by computers, but this one, though never confusing, seemed like a rather sluggish film. Maybe my synapses HAVE fused.Tom Cruise is the maimed Colonel von Stauffenberg, scion of an old aristocratic family, who joins a number of other prominent German officers and politicians after the Normandy invasion in a plot, first to usurp Hitler's power, then, later, to blow him up and take over to negotiate a peace with the Allies.I can imagine that most of it -- not all -- sticks to the historical facts. But in some odd way that's hard to pin down, it lacks spark and tension. The story of Rommel's involvement, in 'The Desert Fox', was at least as gripping as this, though less authentic.Let me take one scene as an example -- when Cruise is first introduced to Hitler. Hitler is having a meeting with Goebels and Goering and the rest of the Black Rebels Motorcycle Club. Cruise is announced, enters, and stands silently at attention at the far end of the room. There is no conversation among the half-dozen others seated in easy chairs across the room. The camera gives us a close up of the back of Hitler's head before he slowly turns to look at Cruise. It aims at the dramatic, yet the power of the scene is kneecapped by its very presentation. The other figures sit as in a tableau, absolutely motionless, wearing slight frowns. Hitler rises as if with lumbago and shuffles over to Cruise to mumble something to him.There is a complete absence of verve. The director is practically shouting at the viewer -- 'Feel AWED!' But the scene is dull. In real life, we wouldn't expect a handful of powerful men to be sitting in silence and staring at one another. We'd expect conversation of some sort, even an occasional chuckle, no matter what the import of the meeting. 'Die Wannseekonferenz' was about a meeting that determined the 'final solution', the mass murder of Jews and other undesirables, and it lost none of its grip by allowing the figures at the meeting to act like humans instead of cardboard figures.All in all, it's pretty slow going, although it's informative in many respects. None of the details seem to be skipped or simplified. I can believe the incidents as they take place on screen. And the performances aren't bad, given that the characters are so limited. It might have been a better movie if the director had asked his talent to relax and remember they're playing ordinary organisms who can be tickled into laughter.I should add that I didn't watch the last quarter hour or so. I knew what had happened and was worried that the film might become too graphic. That was about the last thing I needed.",6,1,1,13 June 2010
All the President's Men," Superlative
","I first read this story when it was serialized in Playboy, with neatly understated illustrations by Punchatz, one of America's premiers. I read the book too, after having kept one ear on the TV hearings. I couldn't follow any of it. I gathered that most of the pols involved were liars and cheats, but what else was new? So when this film appeared I attended it at Tanforan Mall in South San Francisco, hoping that the details would be logically laid out. No dice. I still couldn't follow it. Information was introduced into the story coming out of nowhere. What's the big deal about shredding at CREEP? Wouldn't they habitually shred all the used documents routinely. What I got instead of an exercise in ratiocination was a character study with a convoluted mystery background, kind of like Raymond Chandler without the Weltschmertz. And what a splendid study it is! Redford has never been better. The part of mid-Western WASP Woodward fits him perfectly. Tall, methodical, truthful even at his own expense, his acting is effectively minimal. He rolls his eyes at exactly the right moments. Redford stands in contrast to Hoffman's Bernstein, a short, dark, wiry, pushy Jewish macher who seems not to walk but to dart from place to place. Yet neither of them plays a stereotype; they invest their parts with genuinely differentiated personalities. The rest of the cast, down to the smallest bits, could not be improved upon. And what a cast! The cynical, tough, courageous, profane Ben Bradlee. He hands the manuscript back to Woodstein and strides away between the rows of empty desks in the newsroom, banging his knuckles lightly on one as he passes. Robards outdoes himself. Jack Warden and Martin Balsam are equally fine. (Did they reminisce about working together so closely in 'Twelve Angry Men' fifteen or so years earlier? Probably not.) Performers like Lindsay Crouse have only a few minutes of screen time, Jane Alexander only a bit more, but they are memorable. I'll avoid going over the story and just present in no special order some of the points I found so impressive.At conferences in the Washington Post, all the editors are given to wisecracks, but they almost always check Bradlee's reactions out of the corner of their eyes.The humor, and there is some, is both verbal and physical. When Redford comments during an interview that he is a Republican, Hoffman looks up and stares at him. Redford responds with a prototypical double take. During an amusing scene in which Bradlee is having a conversation with a defensive 'frazzled' informant, ashes fall from Hoffman's cigarette onto the couch and an annoyed Redford brushes them onto the floor. Hoffman returns from his agonizing interview with Alexander and is even more hyper than usual because he is on a caffeine jag.There is no music until half an hour into the film, and after that it is only insidiously introduced more often, mostly nothing more than variations on a minimal set of four minor notes.There are practically no show-offy bravura shots, though the photography is outstanding. One shot is memorable. A crane lifts the camera above the heads of Redford and Hoffman as they work at a circular desk in the Library of Congress. It rises impossibly high. Then, a dissolve, and it rises even higher, slowly until it must be tucked into the library's dome hanging from pulleys. I checked out that room in the Library of Congress and can't imagine how else it was done. The layout of the floor comes to resemble the rose window of a cathedral.The lighting varies from shadowy (but not underlighted) ominous scenes and sterile flourescence, sometimes, as in the garage scenes, combining both.Weaknesses are hardly worth mentioning, but I guess I could have done without some of the repetitiousness. That their 'lives are in danger' is mentioned four times, twice during the same conversation, as if to emphasize what really needs no emphasis. The 'L, P, and M' business also is gone over too many times. None of that detracts from the film's many virtues.What bothers me more about the story has nothing to do with the movie. After this story broke everyone seemed to want to be Woodward and Bernstein. The easiest way to do this was to go after big game. It established a new and perhaps unhealthy tradition in journalism. Franklin D. Roosevelt was a cripple. Yet, by common agreement, no shots of him in his wheelchair ever appeared in the media. For that matter, he had a comfortable menage a trois while he was in the White House, and no mention was made of it. Everyone knew about Kennedy's transgressions but they were considered a private matter in the early 1960s. Even a dullard like Eisenhower had Kay Sommersby. That's all changed now and I'm not sure the change is for the better. Do we really care that a president can use a word like (expletive deleted) in a private conversation, or whether another defines 'sexual relations' in a way that you or I might not? Or that another might have snorted coke during the wilder days of his youth? Do we really care? SHOULD we care? The French were convulsed with laughter at us in the early 1970s. They're probably not laughing anymore.",10,1,1,5 August 2002
The Wizard of Oz," Dorothy, the Small and Meek.
","A stark and bloody tragedy in which a young girl is whisked into a surreal landscape, kills the first person she meets, then teams up with three strangers to kill again.Actually, a beautiful fantasy, unimpeachably realized. Dorothy is knocked out and dreams she is transported to the Land of Oz, where only the Wizard of the Emerald City can send her and her dog, Toto, back to her home in Kansas. Along the way, she picks up three companions who hope that their defects can be corrected by the Wizard. Ray Bolger is the Scarecrow, Jack Haley is the Tin Man, and Bert Lahr the Cowardly Lion. They are all hated and opposed by the Wicked Witch of the East, Margaret Hamilton. It ends happily.Just a few comments. One is that the three companions are kind of interesting. The Scarecrow and the Tin Man are flawed in some way -- one needs brains and the other needs a heart -- but they illustrate a gentleman's model of interaction. 'Oh, thank you very much.' And, 'I wouldn't want to be a burden.' And, in truth, the Scarecrow doesn't seem so dumb. Look at the way he tricks the talking trees into giving up their apples. And the Tin Man shows no signs whatever of having no heart, except that his chest doesn't tick. They're charming without being particularly funny. But the Cowardly Lion is a different matter. He speaks for Everyman. Lahr is outrageously hammy. He has a working-class New York accent. He brags and threatens and he's a complete hypocrite, which the others definitely are not. He's given the best lines and songs too. 'What makes the Hottentot so hot? Whadda they got that I ain't got?' (Steatopygeia, the Hottentot apron, and a language that doesn't seem designed for human speech organs, among other things.) He's our man in Oz alright.Dorothy, of course, is the central figure, and Judy Garland plays her splendidly -- weak and winsome, with huge watery brown eyes. And what a voice! She's a small girl but she seems to sing from her abdomen. She's just about right, cute but not the sort of 'cute' that rouses the pedophile in a normal man. She has high hips, rather shapeless limbs, and no neck to speak of. Later in life, strung out behind leapers and sleepers with a booze backer, she became an idol of the gay subculture. They loved her in her middle age. Every performance raised the question of whether she would finish the show or collapse on the stage.Another thing that strikes me. As in some other films, and speaking as a one-time day laborer who showed up in the line on Warren Street in New York, who does the work around here? In the Emerald City, everybody wears bright green costumes. Who presses them all? And then there's that 'horse of a different color.' Who cleans up after that horse? The songs by Harold Arlen and Yip Harberg are just fine, and the incidental music was heavily influenced by Russian composers. The wardrobe is outrageous.The four of the principals, or five, counting Toto, go through so many adventures and tribulations that when the end comes and it's time for Dorothy to leave, even the most sophisticated and mature among us must weep abjectly, like a child. Maybe Dorothy should have stayed in Oz, married the Scarecrow, served as First Lady and run the place instead of leaving behind a rather shaky political structure. Queen Dorothy. After all, things weren't so smashing back in Kansas. Aunt Em was a pretty cold fish, her husband was emasculated, and the three laborers treated her as a nincompoop. It might have been good to be the Queen.Here's a final thing that struck me. I must have watched this thing a dozen times or more, usually with my kid. I just finished seeing it again for the first time in ten years or so, and this time on an HD TV on an HD channel with Dolby 5.1 sound. The difference was remarkable. I had never been able to see, for instance, that the Tin Man is blotched with small rust patches all over, until he's buffed bright and shiny in the Emerald City. And every stitch of the Scarecrow is visible.This is one you can't really miss. Your cultural literacy depends upon it.",9,3,4,9 November 2007
The Soloist," Truncated Arc.
","It's a pretty neat title, 'The Soloist.' Jamie Foxx is a homeless schizophrenic on the streets of Los Angeles who happens to be (or once have been) a brilliant musician. Now, a mentally ill bum, he plays a violin with only two strings on the sidewalk -- an instrumental soloist. And schizophrenics don't form any social bonds to speak of. They live in what some psychiatrists have called 'the schizophrenic no society.' They're social soloists too.A few years ago there appeared a movie about a young woman who is a dance instructor and finds a terpsichorean genius on the street. It turned out he could do MTV riffs and the moonwalk like nobody's business and this was celebrated as a talent that led to his apotheosis on television. I was afraid this would run along the same dismal gutter.Nope. It's derived from Steve Lopez's (Robert Downey Jr.'s) no-doubt slightly polished book about his discovery of Nathanial Ayers, the challenges the two of them face, and their finally settling into a life style that is satisfactory in the way that most human adaptations are -- incomplete but (shrug) okay.The movie ends with a scene of four people sitting in an auditorium listening to music -- Foxx and his sister (Lisagay Hamilton), and Downey and his friend and colleague (Catherine Keener). Foxx's eyes glow with pleasure but he's still psychotic and he's dressed something like Apollo Creed before the championship bout in 'Rocky.' In reality, there may have been scenes like that but I doubt they were common. A widely-read columnist at the LA Times is unlikely to spend much time with a schizophrenic who lives in a shelter. Not because of any prejudice but simply because of the absence of many shared interests.The film presents itself as the story of Downey, mostly, who first sees Foxx as not much more than an interesting column in his paper. After all, the guy was a student at the Julliard School of Music, which wouldn't look bad on anybody's resume. I mean, Miles Davis went there too. Downey tries to promote some healthier adaptive styles in Foxx. He gets him a cello, for instance, and tries to install him in an apartment. Foxx considers Downey his 'God' but then rebels and throws Downey around bodily. Then they shake hands and go to the concert. An epilogue tells us that Foxx's character still lives in the shelter but now plays many different instruments. You don't just shake off schizophrenia as if it were a bout of influenza.The performances are decent. Downey isn't shown as especially tender-minded towards Foxx. He's matter-of-fact, sometimes comic, sometimes fed up. Foxx does what he can with the role and it's not bad as written. Foxx has features that are brutal but hint at the sensitivity beneath, or the other way round. Keener has a face that seems made for the camera. If her cheeks were any higher they'd be eyebrows. And her throaty giggle is coarse and compelling. Nelsan Ellis plays the young supervisor at LAMP, the homeless shelter, but he paints an extremely satisfying portrait of a man who is resigned, practical, and understanding. He's not written or played as some kind of saint of the streets either. That's one of the nice things about the film. Nobody's perfect. The supervisor disagrees with Downey's desire to get Foxx doped up. 'We can't COHERSE him into taking drugs,' he says mildly, getting the verb wrong. It's obviously a word he learned from pamphlets about the responsibilities of the job. The guy is perceptive but he's not an educated or articulate man.Above all, there is Beethoven's semi-divine music, and there's nothing pompous about the way it's presented. In one scene, his first chance at playing a cello in many years, Foxx's eyes close dreamily as he saws slowly away at the piece, all by himself, the rough notes apparently spelling out no melody. Then we hear the full orchestra inside Foxx's head as it gradually swells and Foxx's solitary strings melt into the more general. There's a visual trick to show us what Foxx sees when he hears music, and it looks like what might show up on your monitor if you use Windows Media Player with a CD.Not that you're pounded over the head with the music. If you want to hear snatches of the life-affirming chorus from Beethoven's ninth symphony, you'll have to listen to tooth paste commercials on TV. The selections we hear are subdued and thoughtful. There are also pop songs and 'May the Circle Be Unbroken.' All in all, if you're patient, if your mind is open, if you're not expecting a lot of fireworks from either the story or the director's way of showing it, this ought to slowly gather you in.",7,0,0,23 April 2010
The Martian," An Intelligent Space Thriller
","These stories of isolated individuals -- 'Castaway', 'Robinson Crusoe,' 'Jeremiah Johnson' -- can be difficult to pull off. They can turn banal in a hurry. Poor Thoreau couldn't do a satisfactory job. 'First, I felled the small fir, then adzed the bark and trimmed the mesophyllum into rabbits for the lallies.' 'The Martian' pulls it off with aplomb, helped greatly by a courageously demanding script from screenwriter Drew Goddard. A cornucopia of plaudits to the guy, and to Ridley Scott for doing a fine job with the direction, and to the performers who are all at the top of their game, especially Chiwetel Ejiofor as a member of the team back on planet earth. The climax is about as tense as it gets. The musical score, alas, is generic.The story is pretty well-known by now. Matt Damon is a botanist, part of an exploratory team on Mars, who gets accidentally left behind. He sets about providing a habitat for himself, much in the manner of a test pilot who has run into troubles. As Chuck Yeager has pointed out, the pilot in distress doesn't panic. He just asks, 'What do I do next?' It may sound a little boring but it's not. Damon's Martian doesn't despair. He describes exactly what he's doing to a video recording he intends to leave behind as a record if he dies. We are the video recording device. He's pretty chipper throughout. An experiment goes awry and he presents his injured face to the device and says, 'Okay. I blew myself up.' About a third of the movie deals with the team back on earth and with the crew of the Hermes, the space craft that left Damon behind. The commander of the Hermes is Jessica Chastain, whom I admire a great deal. It's not just that she's attractive because she's less like a typical Hollywood glamour queen and more like the pretty women ahead of you in the supermarket checkout line. She has a strong jaw but her pale presence suggests fragility, as if one of her long bones might break if she slipped and fell down. I grovel in wonderment at her nose. It assumes a normal tangent from the plane of her face but at its very tip it forms an impudent little outward projection.Speaking of tangents, that reminds me. Some viewers might find the dialog a little challenging -- velocity in so many meters per second, escape acceleration, 'sols' instead of days, Schroedinger's cats or whatever. It didn't bother me a bit. It all sailed completely over my head in the most satisfying way.",8,3,5,5 June 2016
High Fidelity," Sorrows of Young Rob.
","This has generally positive reviews and in fact it's not bad. More than anything else it brings Woody Allen's work to mind. Not his early flat-out comedies and not his late erratica but his midstream features like 'Manhattan.' John Cusack runs a Chicago shop full of old vinyl records and more recent CDs. He knows his way around pop music. Unfortunately he can't figure out a relational calculus when girls are involved. What we do is follow him through a series of full and partial affairs, all of which seem to puzzle, frustrate, and anger him.The style is really Woody Allen's. When a former lover tells Cusack that she's slept with her new boyfriend but they haven't 'done it' yet, he agonizes over the particular meaning of the word 'yet.' He pummels his friends with questions about it. Does 'yet' mean you haven't done it but you intend to do it in the future? In a Woody Allen movie this would be done in narration but the director here has Cusack breaking the fourth wall, directly addressing the camera and leaping with excitement or slumping with depression as he describes one contretemps after another.I could allow myself to be drawn in by some of his feelings -- that the girl is too classy, too good looking, for a schlub like me, even though I myself closely resemble the youthful Robert Redford. Why, just the other day a toothsome blond in the supermarket looked at me and swooned. At least I think it was a swoon. Can swoons follow an expression of utter horror? My understanding of his obsessions with post-Beatles pop music was a little forced because I think most of it stinks. True that one of Miles Davis' better albums is on display, but then some numbskull makes a sarcastic crack about Beethoven's Fifth Symphony.On the whole, if you've enjoyed mid-stream Woody Allen, you should get a kick out of this character-driven story.",6,0,0,29 May 2016
Up in the Air," No Man Is An Airline.
","Some criticism has been made of this film, I notice. It's not worth an Academy Award. There's too much product placement -- Hertz, American Airlines, Hilton Hotels. I can understand that point and can add more. It's not exactly plot driven either. There's a good deal of character dissection and little in the way of action, unless you count flying as action. On top of that, the musical score is execrable -- a warm and fuzzy folk guitar playing pretty tunes with lyrics like, 'There's an ocean of water under your feet....' If you've heard Simon and Garfunkel's 'Scarborough Fair,' you'll know what I mean.The one criticism I thought thoroughly unjustified was that the ending was predictable. It caught me by pleasant surprise.George Clooney is a well-paid bureaucrat whose job is to fly around and fire executives. At any rate, I guess they can be called 'executives.' Many seem no more than mid-level and the only salary mentioned is by one firee, who admits to making $90,000. That doesn't seem like very much, does it? But wait. Let me get my calculator. Yes. That works out to 4.86 times as much as I ever made in my life. Okay. As far as I'm concerned, he's an 'executive.' So in this sense the movie is -- Hold on. Is that the MOST I ever MADE? What the hell happened? I've always wondered where it all went, and now I know. It was never there in the first place.Where was I? Right. We follow George Clooney around and watch him do his job, which sociologists call 'cooling out the mark.' If you're going to fire somebody, you don't want him suing the company or jumping across the desk and strangling you.Clooney is cool, but he's joined by a newbie fresh out of Cornell, which happens to have a fine school of Industrial and Labor Relations. The ambitious neophyte is played by Anna Kendrick who is just plain marvelous. Evidently she was born in Portland, Maine, but sounds like a Valley Girl. The velocity of her speech is like unto that of light. It comes in staccato bursts. And there is one scene in which she is hurrying after Clooney through an airport, demanding to know why he doesn't believe in love and commitments and he keeps parrying her increasingly earnest queries with common-sensical ripostes -- there's no such thing as love, it's all pointless. Then she stops suddenly. Clooney gapes at her as her features screw up into a grimace and she squeals, 'Brian LEFT me!' Clooney's face drops and he moans, 'Oh, ****.' The way I look at it, if a movie has even one scene that can make me laugh out loud, it may or may not be Academy Award material (who cares?) but it can't be all bad.Clooney seems satisfied with his job. He doesn't mind firing people. He gets to tell them about the bright new future ahead of them. He doesn't ENJOY it. He's just good at it and his company keeps him busy.Then he runs into the sensuous Vera Farmiga. She travels around all the time too. They begin an on-and-off affair. It's on whenever they happen to cross paths at an airport. When Clooney is pulled by circumstance into a family ritual back in Wisconsin -- a marriage -- he asks Farmiga to come along as his date. She does, and they seem to have a great time together, although he knows nothing about her. The warm and fuzzy guitarist croons in the background, always a bad sign.On his trips, firing folks and giving motivational speeches, he begins to contrast the life he's leading with the kind of love that Anna Kendrick has experienced. His mind turns to Vera Farmiga, to family and children. So he's launching into a motivational speech at some businessman's gathering and he stammers and hesitates, and I'm thinking, Oh My God, we've got St. Paul and an epiphany on the road to Damascus. Sure enough, Clooney excuses himself and leaves the podium. He hurries to Farmiga's house for an impromptu visit and I'll leave it at that. Except that, when they didn't fall into each others' arms, I wept with gratitude.As I said, I don't care if the movie wins any awards or not. And the pace is a little andante in parts. But then it's largely a story of character rather than plot, and the weaknesses are more than compensated for by the trust that the writers, the director, and the performers have placed in the audience. It's a movie for grown ups and that's distinctive enough these days.",8,0,2,28 September 2010
From Here to Eternity," Hotel Street Boogie.
","Interwoven tales of two mismatched couples on Oahu: (1) dedicated soldier Montgomery Clift and ambitious hooker Donna Reed who wants to return to the states rich enough to snag a proper husband, and (2) authoritarian but sensitive top sergeant Burt Lancaster and self-pitying officer's wife, Deborah Kerr, who finds salvation in their love.Daniel Taradash adapted the screenplay from James Jones' immensely popular novel of the early 1950s, and the movie was directed by Fred Zinnemann. They both must have had a heck of a time with it.Taradash had to meet all the requirements of the movie code of the period. That meant that the villainous Captain Holmes, instead of being promoted for his sadism and inefficiency, must resign under threat of a court martial. It turns an ironic and brutally realistic story into a fairy tale. Donna Reed, instead of being a whore, does get promoted by this movie -- to a kind of paid but chaste female escort. I can't imagine how the writer slipped her line past the censors: 'If you keep drinking you'll be as much use as a melted candle.' Kerr's unfaithful wife is in, but the syphilis is out. Also out is Clift's spell in the stockade, in which the prisoners beat each other bloody in games, in order to gin up their resistance to the beatings by the MPs. In the novel, Clift's character maintains his sanity in solitary by practicing meditation. (I swear I'm not making that up.) Director Zinnemann had his problems too. The casting, unquestionably, is nearly perfect. With the exception of a weak performance from Donna Reed, you can't beat the choice of the leads or the chief supporting players. Sinatra does one of his two outstanding dramatic roles, the other being 'Manchurian Candidate.' And Clift is impeccable as the beautiful young man who was an expert at soldiering, bugling, and boxing. The problem is that the actor was almost always drunk or strung out. He carried around a thermos full of fruit juice and vodka and was pounding innumerable psychotropic drugs. Zinnemann tried no end of takes during a scene in which Angelo Maggio's body is loaded into an ambulance and Clift's line is 'See you don't bump his head.' Fred finally gave up. Fred also had a problem with Clift's fighting, in that Clift didn't know how to make a fist, let alone throw a punch. The use of a stand in during the brawl on the grass is obvious, and the editor had to make sure that none of the medium shots revealed too much of Clift's hands.Philip Ober as the scurrilous Company Commander acts like he's in a cheap B movie, and Donna Reed sounds like an amateur, but everybody in the cast LOOKS right. I shouldn't sound too harsh. I'm sure Philip Ober (a familiar face) was smart enough to realize he was in a potential blockbuster and gave it everything he had. It's just that he didn't HAVE anything.It's also mandatory to mention here the photography, wardrobe, and location shooting. The barracks LOOKS like Schofield Barracks should have looked in 1941. The crummy urban street full of cat houses, tattoo parlors, and drunken enlisted men LOOKS like Hotel Street, though it was shot at the studio's back lot. Even the HASP, or 'the MPs', as Sinatra's character calls them, look right -- huge, bemuscled pituitary cases -- the kind of agents of social control that sober you up with celerity if you note their walking your way. And I've never gotten over the tan summer uniforms of khaki drill cotton. You can almost feel the fabric.Two scenes are memorable. One -- parodied a thousand times -- has Lancaster and Kerr rolling around and smooching in the Hawaiian surf while a wave rushes over their bodies. The other is the attack on Pearl Harbor by the Japanese, brief, and with multiple inserts of newsreel footage and shots from an earlier documentary by Gregg Toland, but exciting and well done.A gripping film that ends unhappily, but unforgettable. It may lead some people to read the novel. The novel opens unexpected doors into human nature. Jones knew whereof he spoke.",8,5,7,15 August 2009
The Godfather," Excellent Execution.
","It's a beautifully made movie. Not just because of the subtle direction by Francis Coppola but because of the production design (Dean Tavoularis) and photography (Gordon Willis). Everything seems to lend itself to the impact of the story, which describes the replacement of Marlon Brando's Mafia chief by his youngest son, Al Pacino. Make up is expertly handled. Pacino's broken cheek is properly swollen and blue and fades gradually, providing the viewer with a kind of cinematic clock telling the passage of time. Nino Rota's score is tops. During the baptism scene, which takes place in a church, the organ hums an apt courtly tune. Then, as the film cross cuts between ritualized religion and ritualized homicide, the organ insensibly becomes darker and more ominous.These departments seldom get enough credit -- except recently in CGI extravaganza's. The more nuanced touches in furnishings, wardrobe, shadows and the like generally go unrewarded by the public. But this film, and a few others like it ('Shane', 'Verdict') wouldn't be what they are if they'd been clumsily handled.Brando has given maybe four nearly perfect performances and this is one of them. To appreciate it we have to skip over all his failed attempts to extend his range, the dancing bookmaker, the comic Oriental sidekick. The Don Corleone we see doesn't radiate power so much as fatigue. Al Pacino is transformed from a smiling lad, happy to be home from the war, to a dispassionate kingpin of crime at the end, a bit too abruptly. Sterling Hayden, as the corrupt Irish cop, has invested this much in a role only once before, in 'Dr. Strangelove.' Example: After smashing Pacino's face with one blow of his oversized fist, Hayden turns away, winces with self control and pounds his fist into the night-time air.It's hard to imagine how Coppola could have improved on his direction of this tragic tale. With the exception of the violent scenes, of which there are many, maybe too many, the film's texture is smooth and understated. Example: A baker shows up at the hospital just before some would-be assassins arrive and Pacino talks this innocent man into posing as a gunman. Not a word from the baker. He does what he's told. And when it's safe, he tries to light a cigarette but his hands are shaking so badly that Pacino has to light it for him.The women don't have much to do. Diane Keaton as the Shiksa is puzzled but hopeful. Talia Shire as the abused wife is hysterical. Mamma Corleone is a revered background figure who rarely shows up.That's the good stuff -- and it's very good indeed.The bad stuff, I'm not sure about. The Corleone family, like the other five families in New York, are making a fortune. That's evident from their digs, their cars, their raw silk suits. But what business are they in? That's one of the things Keaton is curious about. The businesses are only alluded to twice -- ' the gambling, the liquor, even the women.' Well, what's so bad about that? Who gives a damn about illegal gambling, smuggled liquor, or escort services? Nobody. Drugs are brought in towards the end, but only dealt with discretely. We never sell it around schools, it must be strictly controlled, and let the darkies up in Harlem have it and 'kill their souls.' The words 'extortion,' 'protection racket,' and 'Mafia' are never used. This is a pretty rotten business they're in. And if Marlon Brando' Don was a kind of community organizer, Al Pacino's Don is a ruthless hypocrite. In fact, he's a lying, murdering, thief. While he is solemnly taking his oath as godfather to his nephew, his minions are out in the streets slaughtering rivals wholesale -- and in the most graphic way.'Never ask me about my business,' he tells his wife. And one hopes she never does, unless she wants to wind up 'sleeping with the fishes.'",8,1,5,5 April 2015
