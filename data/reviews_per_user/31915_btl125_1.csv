Requiem for a Dream," amazing, all i have to say is amazing.
","The best movie I have seen in a long, long time.  This movie completely blew me away.  The music, the acting, the script, all of it was superb.  I sat shaking on my front porch smoking a cigarette after it was over. It was that powerful.",10,0,0,29 May 2001
