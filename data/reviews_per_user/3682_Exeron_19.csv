The Blair Witch Project," A different kind of horror
","What's most scary, to actually see the thing that's hunting you or never see it. I choose option two, since you have no idea what's hunting these kids you have to picture it yourself, and we got more fantasy then anyone else to create your own fear.You probably know the plot already, 3 Kids is making a documentary about the Blair Witch legend, before going out in the woods they gather up some info for the film, some people actually said they've seen the witch, and they make their own description,which you can picture yourself how the witch looks. They kids, or they are more like youngsters, go out in the forest. They go lost and seems to walk around in circle whatever they go, on the night they hear horrific sounds and it seems like they are not alone out there, someone or something is haunting them.I'm not the horror kind of guy, but i heard of this movie and i decided to have a look. I saw clips in 7 parts on you tube (kinda lame i know :P) but i decided not to pay for anything i haven't seen yet. It gives you the thought, what's hunting these kids and why? The entire movie is filmed with a hand cam, which is kinda confusing in some parts.Scary? Yes, the different thing about this movie is that nothing is revealed, the ending is a real thinker, of course I'm not going to spoil anything.Blair Witch Project 7/10 'Thinking of going hiking, think twice'",7,0,1,5 February 2008
Fight Club," A little bit different...
","But that's why i find it pretty charming actually. I always get an impression of a movie the first seconds. And the intro reminded me of a spider-man movie. But everybody says it good so i gave it a should after all. The first part of the movie i was pretty sure i was about to gave it a 10. The friendship between this guys was pretty amazing. To just fight like that and then later on just become friends. And the introduction of Tyler was pretty awesomely made as well. But then comes the stranger part of the movie. Of course i'm not going to spoil anything, and for those who have seen the movie you know what i'm talking about. But it's pretty hard, i mean i always feel a pressure of rating movies like this. Should i rate it high according to my opinion or because everyone else likes it and it's on most movie top list i check upon. These feelings mixtures a bit. If i've seen the movie before i check'd it out on IMDb i would never have guessed that it would be on the top 250. But it is and i can't complain i guess. But i decided now to give this movie an 8. For still it was a good movie but it got weirder later on and you almost get tired of it, i mean it's like your brain cant handle all the action 8/10 'A bit different fight film, quite charming'",7,0,3,26 February 2008
The Terminator," The Terminator
","I'm pretty sure everybody got a clue of what 'The Terminator' is about. The year is 1984, A terminator (Arnold) is sent from the future to prevent John Connor being borned. John Connor is the leader of those who fight against the terminators. The terminator's job is then to hunt down the mother of the leader, Sarah Connor. But then, sent by John Connor, Kyle Reese. His mission is to protect Sarah from danger.The film is relatively exciting, but somehow i lost the tense and the excitement when i got deeper into the movie. People have been talking about it and said it's really good, so i actually thought i was about to watch a masterpiece.In my opinion, The Terminator is far from a masterpiece, but it's far from bad too. I mean Arnold did some decent acting, but then again he does play a robot. And the movie had 'some' Special FX that would even look good today. When i said 'some' i really mean it. Because most of the Special FX looks pretty lousy today, but i'm not going to judge the movie from that.So to conclude this whole 'review', if you like. I didn't really feel the movie. I understand completely how it must have been back in '84. But i'm living in a society where the audience demands are pretty high. So with all this concluded i can simply say that Terminator isn't a bad movie, but it isn't that great either. But it gives a pretty good picture of the future i guess.7/10 A good, not great, not excellent, but a good SCI-FI picture...",7,1,4,17 June 2008
Gone Baby Gone," Gone Baby Gone-Good but bad directed
","The movie turned out pretty good, not great but pretty good.As many of you already know Ben Affleck directed it, this is the first time i see a movie directed by him. Was i impressed? Not Really. He managed to write a good screenplay, but he didn't do so well on putting it on screen. Most of the views were pretty simple, and now and then they were a few helicopter-sky views. I didn't know why because it didn't fit in the movie at all, it was like 'Hey look we have a decent budget which means we can put a camera on a chopper'. Takes more than that to impress me.Anyway, the story however is based on a missing girl, actually i believe it circles around the whole area of kids being kidnapped. The story was pretty weak but since it was so simple it kept you alert. And with a little matching string music, it actually sucessed.Anyway i wouldn't say that this is a GREAT movie, it's good but not great. I had a pretty hard time making up my mind on what to rate for this movie. I thought 7 was to low so i decided to give it a pretty weak 8. Think of it as a steady 7 or a weak 8. Like 7.5",8,1,2,1 April 2008
Fargo," The Coen brothers does it again!
","Fargo is a city in North Dakota, and this is where the story takes place.Jery Lundergaard(William H. Macy) is a car salesman who's hired two kidnappers (Buscemi & Stormare) to kidnap his wife. The kidnappers will be given a ransom for the returning of Jean, the ransom is being payed by Jean's father, who's very fortune.As in most of the Coen's films the main point is 'MONEY'.All the actors does a great performance and by doing so it gives you the a more realistic feeling. There is no disappointment on the directing part since the Coen brothers are masters of directing.The movie includes their excellent humor which is being lift up with 200 curse words. There for, i can pretty much sum up that this is a classic Coen Picture and it will always be remembered.",9,0,0,7 July 2008
Apocalypse Now," Great...in a weird way
","Apocalypse Now, perfect example of 'War is hell', you'll know what i mean when you see it. I think it's a great idea, a story of a young soldier traveling with a boat through 'Nam, looking for some veteran. Francis Ford Coppola does great movies, but i have to say this movie was very weird, OK i admit it, i was very tired when i watched it, it was finished at 2:am so i guess i wasn't paying full attention to the movie. But some things catch my mind, as i wrote before, this movie really shows the words 'War is hell'. Not to many battle scenes in this one either (wich usually gets boring after 3 mins or so..), instead it shows how the soldiers lived and behaved under the Vietnam war. How they got mad and did everything to survive, the real hate against the Vietcong. Martin Sheen is great in this one. I noticed one thing though, A young Harrison Ford appears. And Coppola and George Lucas was arguing about something, i don't know, but anyway: In the very short scene where Harrison Ford is in, you can see small letters on his name tag pronouncing: G.Lucas Just a funny easter egg....A little resumé of the movie: Great, A bit weird 8/10",9,0,1,10 August 2007
The Usual Suspects," Perfect!!
","First when i heard about the movie i didn't expect much about it, a thriller that luckily was at the top 250 #20. But of course a movie doesn't just pop up to #20 for luck right? Although there are some movies that doesn't deserve to be on the top 250, like American gangster...Anyway more to the movie, the first 10 seconds of watching i was already excited, the music was perfect which kept me busy. And then when the movie was over i was like 'Wow...this is perfect' And it is really. This is the ultimate thriller, i know understand why it's on #20. The characters were very well prepared so the actors had really easy to go into them. I thought the most well played actor was Benicio Del Toro, he played 'Fenster' and he did it really good, so my hat goes off for him.Anyway the movie was as i said perfect, which it why i gave it a 10/10 which doesn't happen to often. The movie was so clever that in the end of the movie you'll go 'Oh..how come i didn't notice that?!' I'm not going to reveal anything of the plot, that's up to you to see but i will give you this hint: 'Keep your eyes open' The usual suspects 10/10 'Brilliant,perfect,clever, this movie will never die'",9,3,5,6 January 2008
Quantum of Solace," The Quantum of Solace
","So i'm lucky enough living in a country where the film is being viewed for the first time to the public. I've had mixed expectations on this one because i knew there were going to be á la Bourne Identity. But i also knew that Daniel Craig would deliver a pretty good performance. And the main villain played by Mathiue Amalric, who actually wasn't as good as i'd thought...but his performance wasn't a disappointment.The movie begins with one of the worst bond intros i've ever seen; a car scene where you practically see nothing because of the super-shaky-way of filming it...The main theme, peformed by Alicia Keys; which was a decent song, better than i'd expected.Although it ends with a ridiculous oh-oh-uh-oh-oh...One thing that i really noticed in this movie; is how my feelings for Daniel Craig as Bond really changed. During a conversation between him and M i realized...this man isn't Bond. I've never thought of it before but when i saw him standing there with his heavy face i just couldn't help myself comparing him to preview bond actors...Pierce and Sean are still the only right Bond actors for me.For those who expects heavy camera action...well you won't be disappointed, at some points i couldn't actually see what was going on. And i'm used (unfortunately) to films that are shot that way...I'd like to point out that there's a scene at the opera which i want you to keep an extra eye on. This scene was one of the greatest i've ever seen in a Bond movie before...so keep that in mind.Quantum Of the Solace isn't a disappointment and there's no reason for you to have second thoughts on paying for a ticket...it's a real popcorn film.",5,36,73,30 October 2008
No Country for Old Men," Coen's Oscar material
","No Country For Old Men The Coen brothers have a theme. What matter kind of genre it is, it'll either make you afraid, or amused.I noticed that the Coen brothers have spent a lot of times with details on this movie. Many things ordinary directors wouldn't even think of, so that's definitely a plus. The one thing that the movie was missing that made me disappointed, was the music. There was no music in the movie what so ever. At certain point there was a mood string playing but that didn't work that much. I mean even at the most silent moments you could add some low trembled guitar or something in that direction. I've seen some Coen films and it's pretty odd for their style not to include music in the film.But they managed to make you feel excited and create a very dark mood after all. So that's a + again.I have to write this: For those who are sensitive of tense moments, jump scenes whatsoever. This movie made me jump many times and the moments aren't small jumps, at some points you'll really freak out, so i warn sensitive viewers out there.Anyway if you like the Coen brothers, and the sort of Texas crime genre, you'll definitely enjoy this movie.90% 'A chilling and thrilling crime story'",8,2,7,5 March 2008
Stardust," Stardust
","It was filled with Adventure,excitement, and some humor scenes too.In the beginning it didn't look much, some stars forming the shape of the title. And a Shakespeare theme that made it all a bit special. The movie didn't have any long and unnecessary parts , which made me happy. And then the moment i've been waiting for...De Niro....as a pirate. One of the best role he've ever had, he must been going through a change of his acting style or he got paid a lot, Because he've never played a more unique role then that, so this goes out to you De Niro fans, he's good in this one. anyway so the movie had some good laughter and some cool special FX scenes, other than that it was just a normal fantasy movie, but filled with great actors, was surprised when Richie Gervais appeared. So that's why i rated 9. Excellent choice of actors and screen play.",8,1,1,1 November 2007
I Am Legend," The movie of 2007?
","First i just want to say that Will Smith did an amazing acting in this one, perhaps the best i've ever seen.Review You probably already know that the movie is about a man who survived an Virus that infected the whole world. The reason why he survived (which i never understood at first) is that he was immune to the virus.Anyway more to the movie, the movie was very tense in the first parts of the movies, i was really scared at some points and it did have some REALLY good shocking moments, so if you are seeing this on the big screen, you'll probably going to crawl down to the floor. Because believe me the first part is really, really tense.Yes that was the first part of the movie, the later parts you are getting more used to everything (i'm not going to spoil). And many things aren't that scary anymore since you've seen it a lot. You'll probably get it.It felt like this movie had two volumes, the first volume is more the slow and thrilling part. While the second volume got more bang bang and all of a sudden it's ZOMBIE CITY!!! There is a major twist in the plot later in the movie which i never thought would happen, of course i won't tell.Anyway is this the best picture of 2007, i don't know. For me the movie year has been kinda weak, i didn't see a GREAT!!! movie though. The movie of the year 2007 for me was American Gangster, which i didn't think was fantastic but it was a good movie. Not that I am Legend is bad, but i now understand why the ratings decreased from 8.0 to 7.4 to fast.I just didn't feel it just as the line say ' I just didn't feel it'. There was some really beautiful parts, with beautiful music that really fitted, and music is the most important point in a movie i think.Anyway this movie gets 75/100 from me, that would be 7.5/10. Well since you can't vote in decimals i will just give it a strong seven, or a weak eight if you like.'A very well made film that will make you jump certain times'",8,1,5,22 January 2008
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Kill Bill
","Quentin keep surprises me. I've noticed that all his movies got the kick-a*s soundtracks in them. And i thought the one in Kill Bill were quite catchy as well.I've heard rumors that this movie was supposed to be awfully violent. Hehe no failure there. But i think violent belongs better in movies than on the streets.Most of Quentin's movies has a very unique style. In some way Tarantino manages to make you feel that you're watching and old classic. Like Pulp Fiction (well about now it is and old classic). It takes place in a sort of 50's town and it looks like the movie was made in the early 70's. Unfortunately i didn't feel the same for this movie, well in some scenes but not very strong if you compare to other movies.Anyway i think this movie was entertaining and i'm not referring to all the violence, it actually was an 'ok' movie Since you only can vote with straight numbers on IMDb i will give it an 8. It's a rather weak 8 i have to admit. it would be 7.5 or so.8/10 It will give every karate fan satisfaction",6,0,2,21 December 2007
Mission: Impossible," Nah...
","Everything i've heard from this movie!!!! every damn kid singing on the theme song i finally decided damn it i gotta see this one...it ended up in great disappointment....man Brian De Palma can do better. First of all i don't got a clue how the theme got so famous of this lame movie. I mean it was OK but it was absolutely nothing special, just a randomly OK movie but not a good one. As i watched it i was beginning to regret i bought it even more of every minute, as these feelings were increasing i turned off the TV and kept watched it the day after. Nothing better than the first part just some plannings and stuff like that and then the whole movie is ending in disaster....The End 6/10 damn it TOM!",6,0,1,7 November 2007
A Clockwork Orange," Stanley Kubrick's a Clockwork orange
","I'm not sure if i made a mistake or not, but i watched the movie before i read the book. But it made me understand the Nadsat language a bit more and made somethings clearer in the book. The movie had some references in the book, some people say that the movie and the book are irreplaceable but i didn't think so at all. 75% of the book is in the movie maybe more but it isn't a lot of other book based movie's i've seen. I wasn't disappointed oh no...but when i read the book i found somethings that Kubrick either didn't want to make in the movie or something that was just corrected or changed entirely, some of those things really drives me crazy.Anyway for a movie this is a masterpiece, how the opera music fits in to the fighting scenes is really breathtaking, that no one didn't think of that before. The movie is before it's time in many ways, it gives you a view of the future (today it's kinda lame since the time when the movie is taking place on is already over). But i bet when it had release it gave a good view. Some people says that this is a movie that you see over & over. I agree, i've watched some scenes in the movie maybe a thousand times. but something keeps bothering me. When i ask people what they think of the movie they go 'OH a Clockwork orange it's so violent and terrifying' , well it is but it's also a good movie. So i keep going on 'Yes but don't you think this it's good?' '...well kinda but it's soooo violent'It's like people is embarrassed to even enjoy the movie, but i'm not!! And i don't think other people should be either, when the movie had it's release the reactions were very strong but that was before, today people watch it without even blink. So please people give it a chance and watch this masterpiece!'A Clockwork orange' 8/10 'A masterpiece'",9,0,1,6 January 2008
Pulp Fiction," The best soundtrack in a movie i've ever heard
","Not only is this a great movie with a cool theme. It got the most perfect soundtrack, i grew up with it actually, my dad bought it when it came out and i've heard the songs from time to time, and now when i saw it recently it all came back to me. This movie got me one step closer for me to like Quentin Tarantinos work even more. The movie was so great and the actors also. Loved everything in it, the cars , the weapons, the theme itself actually. This movie is a classic that will never die, people will remember it in 100 years from now. And Quentin Tarantino will be remembered also. The movie was not to short and not to long in my opinion, but unfortunately it had some slow parts in it, which is why i didn't vote 10/10 on it.",10,1,3,19 August 2007
Die Hard," This is what 'Action' is all about.
","I must say when i first heard the titles name 'Die Hard', i thought it sounded like a really bad movie but as a surprise it wasn't, in fact it was great!. The actors are good and Bruce Willis does a great performance. Some things was a little awkward, like that guy who hanged from a chain around his throat for a half an our and then turned back just fine afterwords and starts to shooting everyone, but i really didn't care i thought it was just fun. And 'Alan Rickman' really puts up the definition 'Evil' in this one, as he have done in a lot of movies, like Harry potter. But more to the point: this is a great Action movie with a descent plot, and its worth every penny...",8,1,2,10 August 2007
Hancock," Hancock
","It's been a lot of discussion about the movie here on IMDb, but most of it isn't about the movie...it's about Will Smith's personal life. So to all those who cares more about Will Smith's personal life and faith are going to be disappointed because i'm not going to bring that up...Hancock My expectations? Were not high but not that low either, i expected a few laughs but nothing impressing. Turns out that i was wrong, i laughed more than a few times and the movie was in some ways pretty impressing.How? With the fact that they managed to create a perfect mix of three different genre's Comedy,Action And Drama...In the beginning i thought 'Here we go again. Another top box office, lame comedy. But later into the movie it really got more interesting, the jokes were pretty well written, the actings were decent but at least they weren't horrible.Then later on came the part i wasn't to happy about, the drama part...it became too much...in my opinion it didn't fit in there at all. Maybe this is just me, but i think that if the movie would have continued the way it had been until the later part, it definitely would have got higher ratings...Hancock is a film including funny comics and some decent drama parts, i'd never thought this but the original score wasn't pretty bad. So there for, Hancock gets a 7.5/10, it's worth the money...and drop all that scientology crap and give it a shot",7,0,2,19 July 2008
The Terminal," Hard to decide...
","...what to say about this film.The Plot- Original as it seems, the movie still contains a lot of American clichés. Like 'Hollywood happy ending'. Exaggerated love scenes and so on. But yet there's something about this movie that forces you to not hate it. Deep inside i thought like 'Man this is pretty silly' But the movie charmed me to enjoy it after all. But some things in the movie still made me think 'That makes no sense'. But the movie was funny, it had humor & Drama, which is a perfect combination, so give it a shot.Tom Hanks, tremendous acting as always. He does the Russian accent pretty well, and i notice that he did his homework when it comes to learning Russia.So we got, Good acting and a funny movie (at some points sad). You think that would be enough? Unfortunately this movie is ruined at some points, some things that make you stop like it for a moment and then later on you love it.I was pretty confused and didn't know what to vote...it leaned towards to an 8 but there were to many points at the movie that i thought were pretty unnecessary and ridiculous. So The Therminal get's a solid 7...nothing more nothing less.If you want to get entertained, rent this then. Don't expect breath-taking moments, but i ensure you that you'll laugh a couple of times...The Terminal 7/10 1st May 2008",7,0,1,1 May 2008
The Simpsons Movie," Great! but not that great....
","The Simpsons movie was great but unfortunately not that great. The plot was not that good according to my opinion but Homer screwed it up real bad which made it funny. More to the point: The movie was to based on the family , characters that you love didn't even had a line. And the movie made you feel that there was nothing around the family. I love the Simpsons and i have since i first saw it, but i'm not such a big fan to the later seasons, This movie had some descent fun jokes, most of them were slapstick but what more can you expect from an animated movie. I expected a lot from this movie, my expectations were decreasing through the mid part of the movie. But there were some moments, and yes you should definitely see the movie, but don't expect to laugh your ass of.",5,12,25,28 July 2007
