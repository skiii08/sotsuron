The Expendables 2," Thank You for the missing man action.
","OK so here we have the best of the best in the Male Action.It was so much fun, thrilling, action packed and of course the corny comical lines.It was nice to see all these big guns (Sly, Arnie, Willis, Norris, Vad Damne Etc..) in one movie! Probably something all of the 80's generation always wanted to see and finally have gotten to see them all under 1 roof.The first one was really good but the second one was totally awesome. Twice the action, twice the fun.Totally worth the money spent.Would definitely go see it again.",10,2,7,22 August 2012
