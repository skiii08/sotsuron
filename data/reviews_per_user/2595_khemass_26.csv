Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," It's so rude and gross
","I can't believe I was foolish enough to rent such a movie! I saw the trailer and it didn't show the ugly parts of this film. I read some people comment that it's so funny, and I saw that the film is nominated for an Oscar. So, I went out and got it just to have a good time. But it turned out to be one of the worst movie I've ever seen. It's so crude and rude and it looks down on races and religions. I couldn't even watch the whole thing. Some scenes are just really tasteless and ugly, too much to be funny.How could they present Kazakstan's culture in such a way? Are the people in this country not mad with this film? I know that the film may intend to satirize some American culture, but the result was that it made Kazakstan looks like the worst country in the world.The 3 that I gave was for the OK performance of the lead actor and for the scene that Borat was nice and sincere to a black prostitute. That was the only scene I thought was worth remembering. The rest are just....Oh,gross!!! I don't recommend this anyone, except you are some people who really like mean, crude, dirty, ugly jokes.",3,3,8,1 February 2008
Finding Neverland," Very inspiring and touching
","I think this film can really show how great stories came into our world, how an artist or a writer can create magnificent and beautiful work. It's all about little things that matter, together with a tender heart and an open mind. It's an amazing film. I've watched it twice and the second time the film even touched me more.This is a slow-moving story, so don't expect to get into a roller coaster ride of fun. The most important things are the little moments of beauty in life that our main character discovers after he met the Davies family, and how these help him to finally bring out his Peter Pan, Captain Hook, Wendy, and even the dog Nana, from his imagination. I think most artists or writers can really relate to the film. Actually, anyone with a tender heart will love this film. The whole cast did wonderful job. Johnny Depp seems to really understand his character. Kate Winslet is graceful and strong. The children did fine too ,especially the one who plays Peter. He can play a boy with such a tender soul whose heart has been shattered and you could see why this character is so special to Barry. No one wants to see a boy like this losing his gift of creativity because of grief so early in life. The music in this film makes you feel like you're in a fairly tale. The pictures are spectacular. This movie makes you feel that Neverland is so close to you,only if you open your heart to it.I don't know how to describe it more than this. All I can say is that the film inspires me to keep on exploring the world of imagination and creative work,and I highly recommend it.",9,0,0,14 January 2008
Gravity," A Perfect Combination of Thrill Ride and Meaningful Message
","I can't understand why so many people rate this movie so low. This is a precious film. I don't care if it's not accurate in terms of facts in physics or spacecraft knowledge. But while I was watching it, I felt like I was being put into the space and experience how it feels and how difficulty life can be for human when we are without 'gravity,' how the earth is beautiful and created just perfectly to be our home. I don't think the point of the movie is to make a perfect scientific film. It has a much deeper meaning about human being and our place in the universe. It also has a theme about not giving up, stop dwelling in the despair and give life everything you have although you don't know if you will make it to the destination. Not matter how it turns out, life 'is one hell of a ride!' It is a film with a spiritual message, particularly that scene that makes the main character get back her courage and her will to live. (Some people think that the scene is ridiculous but to me it's so beautiful and carries a very good meaning. I love it.) And I also love the way they put the belief about afterlife into it, not much but just enough to make this film precious and worth more than the whole crap of non-sense scientific film from Hollywood today. Watching this film...I gain back my courage and the will to live, and I'll try to be thankful for every moment of life, and for the earth that we are living in.Besides, I think it is smart that the film uses only a very small cast and put most effort into special effect, creating a fascinating picture of what is like to be out in the space and be without gravity, making it look so real. The storyline is good. I enjoy the thrill ride from the beginning to the end. It was a very entertaining film to me as well. I give it a score of ten just to balance out those who give it one.",10,4,7,23 May 2014
Cloverfield," I like it and I have my reasons
","I watched this film on DVD, so I didn't get motion sickness and was able to enjoy it.But I could understand that people who watch it on a large screen may feel very dizzy. I was prepared that this movie may suck after reading some comments here at IMDb.com, but it was better than I had expected.The film already told us that the guy who holds this camera is not very smart so I didn't expect anything documentary-like or any good cinematography, just some home video that happens to record a monster-attack event in Manhattan. I think that all the characters and their stories are convincing enough. Rob loves Beth so he tried to go back and save her. (I would feel guilty for the rest of my life if I were him and didn't go back to save her.) Hut, the camera holder, was somewhat a stupid and annoying guy but he really does care about Malena. I can feel that in the way he talked to her after the attack happened. So, I did care for these characters, not very deeply, but I did. At least they seem like real people to me.Next, this film makes me feel like I'm really watching a footage. I think that's one of its best success. The picture blurred and broken at times. Sometimes it was such a big mess and you almost couldn't see anything but chaos. Sometimes you only gets to see unimportant things like people's feet,and you have to use your imagination about what is happening at that moment.But that's what makes the movie feels very real as a footage. I also think the atmosphere look and sound very real (people screaming, crying).However, there are some points that the film should have done better.The ending wasn't very good. It was too similar to Blair Witch Project. And I wish they could have a bit more explanation about where these monsters or aliens come from and why they attack.In conclusion, after all the bad comments on IMDb., I just want to say give this film a chance. I wasn't disappointed. My father, 53 years old, who doesn't usually like movie that used hand-held camera, enjoyed this movie and even said that this is a work of art.Just don't watch it on the big screen, rent a DVD. Be prepared that you're gonna watch something a bit dizzying, and try to use a lot of imagination.",7,0,0,21 April 2009
Pan's Labyrinth," interesting, well-crafted, and original
","I was hesitated about seeing this film at first because I heard that there were a lot of violent and gory scenes. However,it turns out not that bad. Yes, a few scenes have graphic violence but comparing to many other movies,it's not too bad.I have to say that this movie is an art. It combines the fantasy world and the real world very well. I was very impressed with that eyeless monster, the way he has to put his eyes into his hand and raise his hands up to see. It's quite a sight! Never see anything like it. Yes,some imagination presented in this film are a bit creepy but they are very original indeed. The reality world is also well-acted and directed. The story is interesting and really grab my attention from the beginning to the end.One thing I must say, the ending is very good. This kind of film can be just a pointless fantasy without a good ending that gives meaning to it all. But this film ends beautifully.The whole cast did very good job,especially the acting of the girl who plays Ophelia. She looks so natural. She just simply be Ophelia, a simple ordinary girl who just wants to live in a place where she can be safe, loved, and happy. Her eyes express her feeling well and her acting is not too deliberating. Way to go, girl!",8,2,5,5 August 2007
Knocked Up," Entertaining and not too far from reality
","I want to comment on two things. First about the film and then about what it makes me think.OK,this film is fun. It makes me laugh and smile. The performances of the lead actor and actress are enjoyable to watch. I think they cast just the right people, especially the guy who plays Ben. I think overall he really looks like bum but his eyes reflect kindness, just perfect for the role. The film may have been flawed and irritating a few times, but overall this is something of a good work. The story may sound a bit unbelievable, but if you're a little positive on people and believe that among those whose life are crap like Ben can be someone who has a heart, love his own child, and want to learn to be a better person, then it works. Anothing that makes me feel this movie is not too far from reality is that they never present Ben and Alison as easy relationship. They have a lot to work on and probably a lot more ahead after their baby was born. This is true for all couples.This film makes me think. At first when Alison realized she was pregnant and she decided to call Ben, I was thinking to myself that if I was her, I wouldn't even think about that. How can you expect someone who looks like a total failure,jobless, pervert,and doesn't seem to take any responsibility in his life to be a father of your child? But then as the story moves on, I came to think, what if he's not all that bad. What if deep down inside that someone you think it's a total flop, there lies a boy who wants to grow up and be a better person. It's maybe worth the risk to give him a chance. At least your baby can be with the real father. Another thing I learn was, maybe guys really have to be told what to do. Maybe there're things that we women can't expect them to just know it and do it without asking.Well, but I'm not sure if I'm being too positive about guys or not, hehe! Anyway, this film is a delight. I wasn't disappointed at all.",9,2,5,1 February 2008
Dreamgirls," An Enjoyable Musical Film
","I am not particularly a fan of this genre of music. However, I didn't have much problem sitting through this film. The story doesn't have anything much but the way it is presented is interesting enough to capture my attention. Jennifer Hudson is particularly good. At first I thought that she must be someone famous but then in the end I found that she's a new actress and I was like 'Wow!' That scene when she sings 'I Am Telling You' is very heart wrenching. I don't like this type of music but still I find this one very soulful,very expressing. I can feel that she sings what's in her heart. The rest of the cast did great job, too: Jamie Fox, Eddie Murphy, Beyonce, etc. And I love the song that Beyonce sings in the final part of the film (Listen To My Heart or something like that, sorry I forgot) The sight and sound is gorgeous as it should be.Although it's not a movie that I would like to keep for future watch,I like it much better than 'Hairspray'.",7,0,0,19 May 2008
The 40-Year-Old Virgin," Funny, charming, and deliver a good message
","At first I was a bit unsure whether I should see this film after reading some comments that it contains lots of crude jokes. However,after finish watching, I found that The 40-year-old Virgin is not rude at all, although it's filled with all the sex talks and some graphic nudity. The movie has a point and delivers it well. It doesn't make fun or look down on virgins. It shows us that it's OK for a person to wait and have sex with the one he really loves. Sex comes with love can be a more fulfilling experience. It doesn't judge or preach that this is a way everyone should be, just saying that this lifestyle is possible and we shouldn't make fun of those people who choose this way.I think Steve Carell did an excellent job. He and Keener have good chemistry. I like the team who play his friends as well.To summarize, this is one of the best comedies I recommend to both the virgins and the non-virgins. Anyone who wants a good laugh but doesn't want to watch a funny but stupid movie. Trust me, this film has a gut. I really admire the way they take this theme and make it an effective comedy. Oh, and the ending is so refreshing!",9,0,1,22 February 2008
The Machinist," A satisfying film, but a bit weak at the ending
","From the beginning on, this is a ride through mystery. The film keeps me guessing what it's going on with this extremely skinny man who has not slept for a year. It has such strange atmosphere. It's like something is going on but we don't know what it is. I must say the the film really succeeds in giving such mystery. I like the gray and dark shade of the movie. I like the tension it gives to the audience, and the way it keeps you guessing. And most of all, I agree that Christian Bale's action is superb. I heard people talk about that before and after I saw the film, I totally agree with it. Just looking at him makes you feel the tension. I really admire how he devoted to his work and got that skinny for it.One flaw, though. This type of film that gives clues and mysterious things along the way should have a satisfying ending that answer them all. But this one, well, the ending is not bad, but it's not that much shocking or unpredictable. It's a fine ending but it's similar to most Hollywood formulated films. I wish it was more powerful.Overall, I give it a 8.5. This film is worth checking out.",8,2,3,1 February 2008
Ratatouille," It makes me want to cook!
","I give this film an 8.5 It's a delightful and enjoyable animation film. It's fun to watch. It's harmless and good for children. It's heart-warming. It has imagination and creativity. The idea of a rat who wants to be a cook is quite unique and the scenes where there are thousands of rat cooking in the kitchen is quite something to watch.However, there's nothing else to it. The story somehow goes on the cliché theme of 'Believe in yourself. You can be different.'. Something Hollywood films say again and again and again,sometimes successfully, but most not. (Like in 'Happy Feet', an animation that didn't impress me).Nevertheless, this film manages to inspire me a little. The first half of the story makes me want to cook! That quote 'Anyone can cook' sounds so good for someone who doesn't really know how to cook, but admire the art of cooking so much, like me. I like the way little Remy enjoys cooking. It makes me feel that eating good food is truly a pleasure on earth and cooking is something fun.Overall, a good animation that you can enjoy watching and have a good time.",Null,1,2,7 February 2008
Inside Out," Interesting but not deep enough
","This is not a film for little kids. I would recommend it for 10 years old up with a lot of guidance from parents on what this film is about. It would be a good lesson for 10+ kids about human emotions and what they can do to us. But you got to watch the film first, and explain to them, before they watch it or while they're watching it. As an animation, I think this film is average on the quality to entertain. Yes, it's fun to watch and I enjoyed it alright, but it didn't leave much impression on me. Just average fun like a fine animation film should be. I wouldn't say it's boring, but I wouldn't say it's extremely entertaining, either. As for the theme or the message of the story, or what it tries to communicate to the audience. I would say that the film has both good and bad points.I really appreciate the effort of trying to put these abstract psychological ideas of human emotion into something fun and tangible. It's refreshing to see something new and it's good for people to learn how their emotion can take control of them and how experience of life can affect our memory. It's good to see how they portray good memory of early childhood and how loving parents can create that for their child. There are many ideas that I like in this film. I particularly like the idea that 'Sadness' can actually make us turn some happy memory into sad memory, but sometimes it is important to express our sadness so that we can understand ourselves and other people understand us. I agree that sometimes anger, sadness, and fear can have positive use if you know when to use them. I agree that it is absolutely scary when we are blocked from our emotions, when we are numb and can't feel a thing at all. (like in that scene when the control center stops working)However, when you make such a deep subject into a movie, I'd rather suggest that you have to be careful and make sure that you deliver the right message. Are people totally controlled by emotions alone? Where is our 'free will'? We do have our higher self that can rise above emotion and make good use of them. I think it's important that a film like this to communicate this point, otherwise it would be like telling people that 'Oh well, we are under control of our emotions. We can't help it. We can do nothing about it. This is how human is.' In my opinion, human is capable of choosing right or wrong, although our emotions can have a lot of influence on that. Reiley doesn't have to act like a little brat if she steps out of herself and see that her parents have it harder than her. Do imaginations and dreams have to be so pointless and illusive all the time? Sometimes they can contain something beyond what our brain is capable of. But this film makes it all look like they are all nonsense stuff.In other words, if we get stuck to only what psychology books tell us, and we don't go deeper into spiritual side of our psycho, then it is very shallow. I wish that they will try to make Inside Out 2 or Inside Out 3 that will deal with all the deeper stuff, not just basic emotion psychology.Anyway, I really appreciate that they create such a film, I just hope that they will somehow go deeper and deliver a more correct message.",8,0,18,12 August 2015
Twilight," Great chemistry. I like this movie.
","I know that most people hate this movie, but I still have to be honest with myself. I have never read the book before but I like the chemistry that happens between the two main characters. I think that Robert Pattinson is convincing as a sensitive Vampire who really loves his woman, and somehow Kristen Stewart is convincing in her role when she is with him. I like seeing them together, such passionate lovers.I also felt thrilled by the action and the chasing scene in the latter half of the story.I'm not saying that the movie is without flaw. The make-up and some special effects are bad. Some parts of the script are cheesy and awkward. But I enjoyed watching it to the end. It's interesting enough and makes me want to read the book.In conclusion,I don't think this is a waste of time, and I'm not even a teen.",8,0,3,9 April 2009
Before Sunset," Perfect sequel to my most favorite movie
","(Just mild spoiler at the end) At first I thought 'Before Sunrise' is best to never have a sequel and left the ending open to audience's imagination. However, the director, his cast, and his team prove that they can do it. 'Before Sunset' is simply the perfect sequel to one of the most beautiful film I've ever seen. The characters that I love so much are still themselves. They've grown, gone through good and bad times in life, but they are still the same two people we saw in Before Sunrise. The acting and the dialog is so real. It even makes you think of your own life, think of the love that has come and gone, the opportunities you've blown. However, love is still there. This film shows very well that no matter how you've blown your chances, the love in your heart doesn't go anywhere. It's just there.I like the heartbreak moment in this film. It makes you feel sadder than watching the first one, when the two were just young, honest, and romantic people that fell in love. I think Before Sunset makes it more real to life that the two people become more bitter by age and life experience.The ending is a bit too abrupt, but I like it anyway. I like the way it doesn't give you a conclusion. You can think for yourself about how this two will turn out.Now I will go and buy the DVD. This is definitely something to treasure.",10,4,5,1 February 2008
The Illusionist," I was impressed by the ending
","I give this one an 8.5.This is something fine and worth-watching, but you just have to be a bit of a dreamer and don't expect too much of realistic details. (Like some of the magic tricks may seem so amazing that you may wonder if an illusionist can really do that) The story is simple. The dialog is average, nothing especially impressive. No problem with the cast.Biel is beautiful and Norton is always the good actor I remember him. This is not a story that you can do a character study or anything like that. But it's magical. Somehow all the elements weaved together keep me interesting all the way through. But the best was the plot twist at the end. I wasn't expecting it and was very, very satisfied. However, like I told you, don't expect something serious like 'The Prestige'. This movie is pure 'magic', more of a fantasy mixed with romance.After the film finished, I felt like I've just watched a great magician performing some amazing tricks. We all know they are not real, but still love to watch it anyway.I think the film accomplishes what it meant to do.",Null,2,2,22 February 2008
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," Well-crafted but too dark and violent
","I regret watching this film. Not because it is of low quality but because its message is nothing but 'you should return evil with evil' and there are some scenes in the film that were so violent that I could hardly watch.OK. I must say that the film is well-directed, well-paced, thrilling, it is a high quality suspense film if you are talking about it in terms of movie making. People can be glued to the screen because of the film made them feel excited.Well, but if you are a person who believes in love and hope and the power of love and forgiveness, you shouldn't watch this film. Because there is little of that. The whole thing, beside investigation and mystery, is about revenge and how you should return violence with violence. It depicts evil and the fruits of evil and no real or true message about how you should deal with evil in this world beside violence. The film implicitly tell us that it's OK to kill, it's OK to beat and torture someone, if that person is already evil. It's OK to kill your father if your father abuses you. It is OK to stand and watch someone die although you can help, because that person is evil. These kinds of things are understandable but they are wrong messages to be sent into this world already full with too much evil and violence.The main character of the film is presented as a woman hero, someone who is very strong, very smart, with a dark and hurtful past. I don't know what's the big deal about the tattoo dragon on her back either. It looks scary to me.",7,0,0,31 January 2015
Elysium," Well-paced, entertaining, good cast, but no depth
","Since my mom easily fell asleep when she watches slow movie, I rented this one for her and I wasn't disappointed. The movie is well-made and entertaining as an action film and you can keep on watching till the end. I like the way they set up prop, characters, music, and the quick pace of the story. However, there is nothing you can learn from it. No significant theme, just the plain 'the poor will one day fight, if the rich beat them down too much.' and 'you are born for something' but the latter wasn't well supported by the movie although it tried. I didn't feel touched or moved by the connection between the main character's childhood, his relationship with his childhood sweetheart and his carer, and his triumph at the ending. The script is not that good. And there is much violence in the film as well, sometimes unnecessary, in my opinion. (but which actions movies don't have much violence these days, very rare (sigh!)) In conclusion, watch it if you want to enjoy a fun ride. But expect nothing precious or thoughtful.",8,1,2,29 December 2013
Don't Breathe," Good Thrill But Terrible Message
","I rate this film 5 because, as a thriller, it did hold my attention and gives a thrill ride. Despite most reviews, I kind of like the darkness in the atmosphere. It makes the film look mysterious and a bit scary. I also like the way the camera moves in unpredictable way. However, this film is morally rotten and its ending made me angry. It makes me hate this movie and never want to watch it again and will not recommend anyone to watch it at all.(Big Spoiler Ahead)This movie has terrible story. I mean, the protagonist girl is selfish and cruel for breaking into a blind old man house to get all of his spare money so that she can live the life she wants. To me, I cheer for the old man most of the time to kill Money and Rocky and maybe sparing Alex, who seems to be the most decent among them. Then I found out that he is also a criminal. But still...to me, the motivation of the blind man for becoming deranged and lock that rich girl who killed his child and got away in the basement until she gives him a baby is more understandable and deserve more sympathy than what the protagonist girl did. Do you think stealing all the save money of a blind old man who lives alone is something to celebrate? The triumph of the protagonist girl in the ending makes me feel how morally rotten the world has become.",5,1,2,7 October 2017
The Fountain," A film so unique, so fascinating
","I am going to buy this film in DVD very soon. I want to keep it. This is a film unlike anything I have ever seen. It's like a beautiful picture that is partially abstract but carries deep meaning. Without a good director, this kind of film could totally flop or lose its focus or become a very, very confusing film. Fortunately, Darren Aronofsky knew what he was doing.The film captured my attention from the beginning to the end. The computer graphic is so beautiful, especially the scene of the tree floating in the space with millions of stars surround it. The music is beautiful and haunting. The performance of Hugh Jackman is excellent and Rachel Weize also did a good job in her two roles.This is a film about mortality. It talks about the truth of death and birth, how these two things cannot be separated. It talks about what eternity actually is.However, for those who does not want to watch something philosophical or complicated, don't go for 'The Fountain'. You may not enjoy it. It's a film that you must think a lot while watching, not pure entertainment.",9,2,4,20 July 2007
The Shawshank Redemption," One Of the Best Film Ever Made
","I have watched this film many times and I never feel bored. It is a kind of film that make you feel that human has the potential to go through all kinds of suffering. It makes you feel the strength within human spirit and hope that never dies. After you see what the main character did, you come and look at your life and find that it is not that hard, we can keep on trying a little more. Impossible things can be possible. Spirit doesn't have to be broken by cruelty or hardship.When I watched it, I would think 'look at him, for all those years of being imprisoned without doing wrong, for all those times of going through evil people that treat him harshly, this man never gives up fighting, never give up hoping and trying to find his freedom, and he made it, and his strength even brought back the life and hope of another person' Then, I would think...why don't I be more patient and keep trying with my life, keep trying for my dream. Just do it again and again, and one day I will get to where I want to be.Excellent film in every element of it. It's exciting, touching, and moving. Highly recommended for all who have not watched. It's a must-see for everyone.",10,0,0,6 January 2014
1408," Reminding me of real nightmares
","This film is a good thrill ride. It builds up fear and tension very well without using too much blood. I like the way it slowly makes us scared of this room by let us hear the story about it first. I also like the way it creates a world of nightmare where anything can happen and then disappears and then changes into something else. It's like getting locked in Hell and you can never escape even when you thought you already have.I have had nightmares before and I must say that this film present something very, very similar to them. A world where you can never escape and the horrible thing in them came from the depth of darkness in your heart.However, the film drags a bit in the second half. Too many things happen at the same and without a break. Also,the story doesn't really give any significant message. If it has a theme, then it fails to deliver that theme, because I didn't learn anything. It was just a good scary movie that tells you how things in your head can haunt you like hell. I didn't like the ending. It was a bit confusing what the movie tries to say at the last scene.Overall, I recommend this one for anybody who enjoy psycho-horror films. I wasn't disappointed. This movie kept my heart beating and my eyes staring at the screen the whole way through.",8,1,2,27 January 2008
Step Up," It wasn't entertaining
","I didn't enjoy this movie, due to several reasons.1. The plot is nothing new.Very, very predictable and not interesting.2. The script and the building of characters are very poor. The characters change from bad to good without any believable reasons. It was like one night he wants to be a bad boy then then the next night he wants to be a good guy. People can change that easily? In reality does it take some more motivation? And how did the two leads fall in love? Why did they fall in love? When did she feel there is something desirable in him? I don't see anything that leads to their romance. It was like, OK, let's fall in love, because the director tells us to.3. The acting was fine. I think the supporting cast were OK. They did a passing job. And I especially Rachel Griffiths in her role of dance school director. She looks so graceful. I also think Jenna Dewan is believable and natural as Nora. However, I wish I could see more expression on Tyler's face. He has such a dead look even in the scene when he was about to kiss Nora for the first time. There should be a spark in that moment, but there was none. (I don't have anything against him, though, his body was beautiful and his dance skill was fine. He just needs a little improvement on the acting.) 4. The dance scenes were good. I enjoyed them. I can see that they have worked hard to make those scenes look good. BUT there were too few dance scenes in this movie!! This is disappointing for me because I was expecting that at least, if the script is bad, I should be able to enjoy a lot of dance in this film. But why did they make a dance film with so few dances? I just don't understand. Some movies are very boring, such as 'The Company', but the ballet scenes are so incredibly beautiful and there were a lot of them in the film and that was enough to keep me entertained. But this one lacks good story and lacks dance scenes.Conclusion: I don't know what to enjoy in this film, and I don't really blame the cast.",6,0,1,25 April 2009
La Vie En Rose," Flawed but still good
","I had a problem recognizing some characters in the film. Maybe that's part of the reason that I didn't enjoy it fully. I agree with everyone here that the lead actress did an excellent job. There are some memorable scenes, like when she heard that her lover dies from a plane crash or when she signs the last song of her life on the stage. Those eyes can really reflect a life fully-lived.The music in the film is so beautiful. I never heard of Edith Piaf before and there was no caption in the film to tell me what the songs were about, but right after the movie ended I looked for more info about her and her songs from the internet. I found out that the lyrics of the song are also meaningful and that Edith Piaf is a more interesting person than the way this film presents her. Why? When I watched the film, Piaf looks like a lonely woman, famous but lonely. She has lost many people that she loves and she went through some tough times when she was young. But, that's it. The film doesn't tell us that she had helped people during World War II. It's a significant part of a person life. It shows us that she is someone who cares about others, not just herself. Watching this film makes me feel that Piaf is too obsessed with herself and her singing and her lover. She's like a brat that demands everyone around her to do this or that. But the real Edith Piaf, I think, she's someone more special. There is something else in her that makes people love her so much. Still, I must say that this film is a fine one. It captures my attention throughout and it sure sparks my interest about this singer. It's not a waste of time. If you have a chance to see it, then see it.",8,2,4,25 January 2008
Before Sunrise," I fell in love with this film
","This is one of the most romantic movies I've ever watched. It's so real to me, the way the two characters, meet, talk, and fell in love with each other. It's very simply and sincere. It's like watching some special moments in time in the life of two people, who may or may not going to meet each other again. Some people say that a movie shouldn't base on dialog, but I think this one is an exception. The realistic dialog and acting really grips my attention and pull me in. I felt like I was watching two people falling in love.I know that people can view this differently. Some may say that it's impossible that such a thing can happen and two people are talking this way. But what I want to say is, this thing can happen and two people can talk this way.The film even reminds of some experience that I had in my real life.For me, the timing of this film is just perfect. The music used is just right and fit in with the mood of the film. The cinematography captures the romantic atmosphere of Vienna. I've got my favorite scenes and I can watch this movie over and over again. It will surely stay in my heart.Thanks to the director for creating such a unique and magnificent piece of work. Never watch anything like it.",10,3,6,1 February 2008
Lucy," Entertaining, thought-provoking, but distorting some truth
","I think, as an action movie, it's an entertaining film. It is exciting and thrilling with some fantastic visualization, and also refreshing to see Scarlett Johannson in this kind of character. Adding to that, it has a thought-provoking message about how it would be like if human can evolve so far as to use a 100% of our brain. It talks about how we would no longer see trivial things of life as a big deal, how we would use our psycho power so effectively, how we could remember far back into our birth moment, remember far back into the beginning of human evolution and understand the whole journey of humanity as a whole and then we no longer need to be in this world because in the end we will transcend it.Yes, I believe these are truthful and it's nice to have such food for thoughts, something reminding us that we don't have to forever be this way.However, I completely disagree with a few things that the film convey: - Once she is transformed to use more of her brain, Lucy was very cruel and merciless, she killed and killed. If we evolve higher and higher, I believer there is no way that we will be more violent toward each other! No way! We would have so much sensitivity and so much knowledge and wisdom to have deep awareness of how much life is precious and how much we all are connected to one another. It is bad to present Lucy in a form of heartless killer, although she only kills the bad guys.-I think in reality there is no medicine that could make this kind of evolution happen to us and we shouldn't try to produce anything like that. Meditation of the right kind can make some people use their will power and travel back and forth through time just as fine. It is a matter of mind, spirit and soul, not much of brain.But anyway, I'm glad they present something thoughtful and new in an entertaining way. At least it gets many people to think far beyond this body, far beyond our current level of existence.",8,1,5,28 January 2015
Moonrise Kingdom," Beautiful, Thoughtful, and Fun
","I think this is like a good work of an artist. The film conveys a serious message through children love story and facts about landscape and weather. It's like an art film yet it is not too complicated to understand. There are many funny moments as well, so overall is entertaining all right. All the cast did good job. The story is told in a stylish way. The right kind of music is used just as the right moment.Superficially it might look like a children story or a comedy, but actually the film communicates to us some serious themes. A lack of love inside a family, a sense of loneliness, unacceptance from peers, and ignorance from other adults around them can lead children to violence, runaway, and too-early romantic relationship, for they have strong pull toward each other to compensate what they miss in their life. However, the film also gives us hope that with love and understanding and acceptance, we can stop them from getting lost. I think one of the best thing about this film is the way it makes me feel that the love between this girl and this boy and their runaway effort is like the big storm and the terrible flood that happened to this land, you can't stop it. You have to accept it as it is. It might do some damages, but in a long term, the plants grow much better on the land. It also shows us how we judge others base on what we are taught, but this movie ask questions like...does a scout leader who loses his whole troop really have to be an irresponsible leader? Does a police who loses two children under his protection is a lousy police? We adults often blame one another based on these superficial things when blaming doesn't help make anything better at all.I'm not a Wes Anderson Fan, but I like this movie.",8,0,0,28 January 2015
300," Impressive visual experience and good acting, but too much violence
","I give this one a score of 7.5 I think the film has both its strength and weakness. There are things that I really like and things that I hate.Let's start with the bad points first. Too much violence on the battle scenes. A lot of slaughtering and blood spilling. I don't think that killing is something beautiful and some scenes in this movie are just like violent video games.No children should watch it. There is also unnecessary graphic sex and nakedness(the dance of the fortune teller and the sex between the king and the queen). The modern music does not go well with the ancient war story. Sometimes the background music is like noise to me.However,I still have to say that this is a successful movie. Before I watch the film, I was thinking that if it turned out to be another brainless violent story, I wouldn't waste my time watching the whole thing. However, once the it started, I couldn't help keep watching it. The visual is really outstanding.Even that stupid dance of the fortune teller looks beautiful. The story is very simple and easy to follow. Nothing new in the plot or dialog, but that's not the main point of the film anyway. The reason behind the war sounds like good reason to me. I'm someone who minds a lot about the theme of movie. If a movie sends out terrible message to the audience, I would hate it so much no matter how well-made it it. (for example, Kill Bill,the film that says to everyone 'Revenge is sweet and killing is funny and entertaining' Oh, how I hate that film!) Nevertheless, 300 does not have such a terrible theme. A country has the right to stand and protect its freedom and its land. I think it's fine for a king who fight for the independence of his own country. I think I can see brave people in this story. Men in the past need to be quite tough to survive and they have to fight to the last breath, I can understand that. So, the movie is a bit too violent, but not without good reason to support it. (Braveheart is one of such movies) Another thing is good acting. Gerald Butler makes me believe he's a good and brave king, and a great warrior. The queen is beautiful and elegant. She looks powerful when she talks. (Much better than the one who plays Helen in Troy) I like also, the actor who plays the Persian King.The clothes that Persian people wear look weired but interesting, suited the film's overall style.To conclude it, I can't say I hate this movie, but I just don't like some scenes that emphasize violence. It's an entertaining movie that keeps the audience stick to the seat from beginning to end.It's an excellent computer graphic art.The story is about some brave ancient people who fight to protect their independence and dignity, so it's not stupid, although there's nothing new in it.Just don't take the children to see it, I insist.",Null,1,3,7 February 2008
