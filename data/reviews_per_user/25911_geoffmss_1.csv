Walk the Line," Music Great - Not Enough?
","OK so it may not have been bang on in accuracy of Cash and Carter's life together and it may have upset Johnny's daughter, but there is no denying two fantastic performances from the leads. I think it unfair to say that Witherspoon was too pretty to play June. June was actually very pretty and given the miracles of modern cosmetics would have stood toe to toe with Reese Witherspoon.The music was great. We should have had more. Phoenix is quite stunning in his voice portrayal of the singer. Arguably Cash made some of his best music in the last ten years of his life and pity the story stopped in the 1960's. Reading the official biography clearly there is a lot to tell about Cash.",8,0,1,22 February 2006
