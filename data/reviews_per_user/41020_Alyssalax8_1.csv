The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," Understanding
","I don't think people really understand the point of having the book split into two parts. If you have read the book, then you would know that it was WAY too long and action-packed to be put into one movie. Yes, Mockingjay: Part 1 was not very action-packed, but that was the point! There were so many details in the book that you need to understand what is going on before you jump right into the action. I have read so many complaints that the movie was 'just a two hour preview', but are you going to just jump into a war without knowing the details first? I, personally, am a huge fan of The Hunger Games books and movies. I think all of the movies have followed the books very well and they did a great job picking the actors. Jennifer Lawrence does an amazing job portraying the emotions that she needs and she plays Katniss, the character, very well. She especially did a great job portraying the many emotions of a distressed Katniss after two games. It's also nice to have two extremely attractive prominent characters :). They, too, do a great job of portraying the characters from the book. The plot was not super action-packed, but that's how the book was. The first half started out in more details of District 13 and the rebellion that is starting. Overall, I think the movie was really good! I would recommend to anyone that it is a great movie, and you don't want to miss out!",10,26,68,22 November 2014
