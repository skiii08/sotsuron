The Avengers," Assembled
","WOW--just WOW!!! Superhero movies have come and gone and not too many are very well made. Hollywood eventually takes a good concept and then they add multiple villains or partners to the main hero and things do not work out. Was this going to happen with the Avengers? How would you get multiple heroes in one movie and tell a good story? What would Josh Whedon bring to the movie? Is this movie going to have the golden Whedon touch that was shown in Firefly or the horrible disaster known as Dollhouse? Let's start with the story: the script was well written about how the team was assembled and how they went from individuals to a team, the foe was well created and produced a nice adversary for the team, and the dialog was above the norm that you see in superhero movies.Characters: whether you are a fan of the Hulk, Captain America, Thor or Iron Man--you will not be disappointed. Each of them have adequate screen time and all of them have wonderful action sequences. Though Black Widow and Hawkeye are not from the original Avengers team (they became Avengers much later), they fit into the movie well and add to the dimension that Loki brings to the story.Everything is great about this movie. The film was well paced, the direction was great, the acting was super for a comic book adaptation and the action was out-of-this-world.Easily one of the best, if not the best, superhero movie to date. Highly highly highly recommended. I would suggest 3D since there are many scenes that are dazzling in the 3D format.",10,1,5,4 May 2012
The Expendables 2," Yo, I'll Be Back
","The second installment of the Expendables is not as well directed or written as the previous version. The script is what is lacking in this movie--there are a lot of useless scenes and not as much character as the first movie. The action is fast paced and it is sometimes funny to see 60-year olds beat up on young men. Jean Claude is basically Jean Claude as the villain and he is serviceable, but it would have been a better climax to have JC fight Chuck Norris to see the two martial arts men in action. Unfortunately this is a Sly driven film so that you have the bull rush of Rocky fighting the grace of JC--too bad it is a short scene and not worthy of a big climax.Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed the movie. I did not have high hopes for the film since the first one was not a Rocky, Terminator, Die Hard or Lone Wolf McQuade, but it was fun. I expected less than the original unless there was a screenwriter with a better vision, but you get what you usually get with sequels--a decent product that doesn't match up to the first film.The best part of the film is the quips between the characters. While there are some good lines between Randy, Dolph, Jet and Terry--the best lines are the ones shared by Sly, Arnold, Bruce and Chuck Norris.A good movie to see your favorite 'old' action heroes, but not something new or original that is going to WoW you.",7,1,7,17 August 2012
Source Code," Code Dumb
","Science Fiction movies usually try to keep some sort of 'possibility' within their story lines. We know that you cannot travel through time, but the theory may one day be put to use and warping through time and space may be a reality. Source Code indicates that when someone dies you can still see their last eight minutes. Interesting concept. The problem is that no matter what they try to say--once you are dead that implanted memory will never ever ever change. So this movie has someone go into a dead persons memory, but the dialog changes and the events change. Could never happen. Plus, it becomes an entire world and he leaves the area the deceased was in--where that could never be since the imprinted memory would not open the entire world to someone who enters. The movie is beyond dumb with an idiotic idea. Even if you suspend reality, science, intelligence--the ending is one of the worse I have ever seen. Not recommended.",5,1,4,19 August 2011
Resident Evil: Afterlife," Not Bad
","Resident Evil: Afterlife is not going to be considered one of the greatest movies of our time, nor would it be considered very good. RE is an average film that has been made more palatable by the 3D camera. While the acting, the story and the direction are all equivalent to a straight to DVD movie, the 3D effects make is surprisingly entertaining to watch in the theater. The story is so full of holes and bad dialog that you have to be able to ignore all of that and allow yourself to be engrossed into the 3D effects upon the screen. The 3D looks marvelous and the camera makes the film come to life. One thing that is highly irritating about the entire Resident Evil series is the consistent effort by one corporation to destroy all of mankind. Let us be real folks--people want power to have women (or men), money, to enjoy and have things others do not have, to have the finer things in life and to have control over others. If the world is gone--if everyone is dead---if there is no money--then every single survivor in essence is in power--but power that is not desired. That consistent drive to kill everyone by Umbrella is just stupid and annoying.",7,7,16,11 September 2010
Hereditary," Torn Genes
","One of the worse films that I have ever seen. A script that is beyond repair and full of more holes than a block of swiss cheese. Many unexplained things that happen for no reason. Many stupid ideas that are so clichÃ© that is makes the movie feel like a pun.A grandmother who is labelled a 'queen' of demon worshippers. Which you find out at the end. Somehow she is the mother of this demon cult - but she is dead. So you wonder why this did not happen before she died. A granddaughter who was supposed to be the demon lord. But she has nut allergies - I guess demon hunters should use nuts. She somehow gets killed in an accident and now her spirit wants the body of her brother.A mother who has sired the demon lord (as the daughter) - but unwillingly. In this movie the grandmother had (you see in photos and models) breast fed the child - so I guess queen demon follower breast milk produces demons - another stupid idea. All these beheadings make no sense and are never explained. A mess of a movie - it is not a thriller, a chiller, just a money stealer.",1,4,9,13 October 2018
A Star Is Born," 8 Star
","The first 2/3 of A Star is Born is absolutely fantastic. The relationship between the characters is strong, touching and believable. The songs are well written and flow nicely into the storytelling.
The last 1/3 of the movie drags on and loses the sparkle, humanity and human touch that the beginning of the movie has. It does not take away from the film, but does not live up to the first 2/3 of the movie.
Overall a wonderful film that is much better than the original versions.",8,0,3,3 March 2019
Wind River," Reservations
","I am giving Wind River a 7 - 'only' and 'only' for the performances in the film. Each and every actor (until the last 10-15 minutes) is extremely good in this film. It is a movie with a lot of character actors and no real leading person - which turned out to work very well.The story is predictable and very drawn out. For a movie that logs in at less than two hours, it feels a lot longer. The final act of the movie is just plain bad - it felt lazy and cheap - with a flashback scene to explain everything - which felt like someone could not find a way to write it well enough to have the facts found through detective work.The final minutes hurt this movie. I won't divulge what happens, but it is not a plausible solution to the crime.A better last act would have propelled this to a 9 - the script and last act could have put this at a 5-6, but the acting gives it a mean average of 7.",7,2,6,13 September 2017
Star Trek," Enterprising
","I was very hesitant to go and see the new Star Trek movie. Since I enjoy the original series (and the movies) a great deal, I did not want to watch J.J. Abrams destroy the reputation of the franchise. Why make a movie with Kirk, Spock and McCoy? What not make Star Trek with different characters? I was pleasantly surprised. Star Trek has beautiful special effects. Star Trek is eye-candy in warp speed and well worth watching just for the effects. The script was average, but it worked to get the movie going. There is no depth to the story and you will not be reminded of past stories by Gene Rodenberry. There is no morality setting, nor a great chance for character definition. It is a two hour movie and the script must account for Kirk getting command of the Enterprise and the seven main stars (Sulu, Checkov, Scott, Uhura, Spock and Kirk) to be together.At first, Star Trek faithful will be thinking 'this is not what happened in Kirk's life'---etc. It is later that the audience finds out why things are different than in the past days of Star Trek. It is an interesting concept--one that allows for a new franchise to be built without trying to keep the structure of the old series and movies. Now there is a clean slate where any story can be conceived and plotted.Acting will not stun you in the movie. Karl Urban and Simon Pegg stand out a great deal. You can see where each one of them took something from the original character and introduced it into their performance. Zachary Quinto is very good as Spock and he looks like a younger Leonard Nimoy. Chris Pine takes nothing from Shatner and it shows. He is decent as Kirk, but not great. Pine is the one flaw (and not a serious one) in the movie. He has the cockiness of James T. Kirk and some of the swagger---but he does not have the screen presence and he does not have that 'inspiring' command attitude that would make any military man follow Kirk into battle. The rest of the cast are alright. There is more screen time for Uhura and Sulu than in the series. It was a bit silly to have the fake Russian accent for Checkov though--that could have been avoided. Bruce Greenwood is good as Pike (he is always good) and Eric Bana is fantastic as Nero. The acting is not stellar, but it plays well to what was allowed. It also opens the door to deeper relationships in future movies.I would recommend Star Trek. It is not better than the original, but it is a nice homage to the series.",8,2,10,9 May 2009
Darkest Hour," Dreadful Two Hours
","This is an attempt to look at Winston Churchill in the same way that a few back movie makers looked at Lincoln. The problem is that Lincoln was well written and Darkest Hour is a script nightmare. Lincoln looked at one aspect of his presidency and we were shown the trials and tribulations of working towards that one goal. Darkest Hour has a script that is all over the place. It would have worked better had it focused on one aspect of Churchill, but it doesn't. We see him become Prime Minister, but nothing is really given credence on why he was so targeted by politic rivals or why the King was so hesitant to trust him. If you are going to mention those aspects, it would help to identify and explain them in more detail.While the advertisement shows a lot about Dunkirk - Dunkirk is just a blurb in the film. I was looking for more information about Dunkirk, but it is just one of many background items that are superficial to this script.45 minutes into the film I looked at my watch and was shocked that it was only 45 minutes since it had felt like it was two hours into the film. This film feels long - it feels very long since it is poorly written and it drags on and on and on. Not one that I would recommend.",4,48,92,31 December 2017
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," An Actual Star War
","Rogue One is actually a war movie. It has the drama and action that you would expect in a military movie along with the science fiction element.Rogue One also has the usual Star Wars element - bad, bad acting. Diego Luna is horrible - beyond horrible - he almost destroys this film with his lack of acting skill. Felicity Jones is okay. She does not do anything to make you invest any emotion into the character and her performance will not make you feel like you care about the character.As in the first three films - the supporting cast is what makes the movie. Han Solo and Chewbacca carried the first three films. In this film Alan Tudyk (K-230), Donnie Yen, Wen Jiang and Riz Ahmed are the characters that you find that you are rooting for and that you like. K-230 has all the best lines in the movie.I am not sure why the Star Wars franchise insists on casting terrible actors as the leads. Thank the force for the supporting casts.",7,0,6,24 December 2016
Captain Marvel," Marvelous Piece of Garbage
","Wow - talk about a blunder. Marvel movies (except Avengers Infinity Wars) have progressively been getting worse and worse, but Captain Marvel is one of the worse superhero movies of all time. Yes - one of the worse. Worse than Green Lantern, worse than Electra, worse that Batman vs Superman, and even worse than Daredevil.
So what is so bad about it?
Let's start with acting: Brie Larson is a highly touted actress since her role in Room. Now playing a superhero does not take a lot of effort - but you have to make an effort to be likeable. Brie is so wooden and dull that she actually is a hinderance to the film. If you want a comparison: she makes George Clooney look great as Batman - or Jennifer Garner look like an Oscar winner as Electra - yes folks she is that god awful.
The best performance in the entire film is - the cat. That is sad.
Annette Benning is also wooden, dry and unlikeable as Captain Mar-vel.
The flow of the movie is awful. You keep wondering how a movie with so much action is so boring. It flows poorly and it is not well directed.
The script is terrible. Some of the scenes are just plain stupid - for one (spoiler) the cat is an alien that shoots out tentacles - rip off of The Thing, Tremors, Stranger Things - but what is so dumb is that this 12 pound cat tosses out (which is physically impossible) about five tentacles that are human size from its maw - the cat would have had to grow to the size of an elephant to do that and after it does that and it devours multiple humanoids you see it still in Fury's arms as a small cat.
The film makers took an obsolete Marvel character that most people did not know and butchered it - destroyed the heart of who Captain Marvel (Miss Marvel) to those who have read the books. The film makers knew nothing of the Marvel universe and it showed:
1- Miss Marvel came over 20 years after the Avengers - but in this movie her call sign (as a pilot) was Avenger and Fury takes that as inspiration - that is a big eye roller.
2- Fury does NOT lose his eye from a cat scratch. That was beyond stupid and the fact that the cat was still in his possession after it tears his eye out makes no sense. The entire eye clawing scene made no sense.
3- Captain Mar-vel was a great warrior who fought against the Skrulls. Grab The Death of Captain Mar-vel by Jim Starlin - great book - the only time a superhero dies from cancer. Yes, from cancer- not from being shot by a traitor.
4- The Skrull are the Marvel version of terrorists and evil. In this movie we make them heroes. That just destroys the entire Marvel universe in one shot. But in this politically correct culture you can see someone's agenda being pushed - like making today's terrorists the heroes.
The movie was downright poorly made with a bad director, a ridiculous script and the worse actress to play Carol Danvers.",2,3,5,9 March 2019
Star Trek Into Darkness," Space Seed/Wrath of Khan Dumbed Down
","To understand this review you may have to decide whether you are the kind of science fiction fan that enjoys a more cerebral show or a mindless eye candy fest. The original Star Trek had gaudy outfits,cheap special effects and a low budget; but it was filled with great characters and stories that mattered and addressed issues of our culture (race, greed, etc). Star Trek was more cerebral than most shows on television and that translated well to the movies. While the first Star Trek film was a complete bust, the franchise rebounded with The Wrath of Khan, The Voyage Home and The Undiscovered Country. Khan dealt with a madman intent on revenge while covering the main characters dealing with issues of growing older, finding out about their past and dealing with loss. Shatner showed the acting ability that garnished him stage roles prior to Star Trek. Some folks did not like Star Trek because it had a more cerebral approach and it was directed more at characterization and story over eye candy. Star Wars, on the other hand, was a complete mind-numbing juvenile series of movies that relied on eye candy because there was no acting and no storyline worth mentioning. This is what seems to appeal to the masses though. Now comes Abrams who turns Star Trek into a mindless fusion of Star Wars meets Transformers. The story lines are bad, very bad, and lack cohesiveness on every level. The movies have little to no character development and actually steal lines from the original to 'try' and bring some sense of character to the film. Like The Transformers the movie is all about death, destruction on a mass scale and eye candy special effects.So what is good about this version of Star Trek? Karl Urban does a great job as McCoy and would do Deforest Kelley proud in his translation of the McCoy character; Zach Quinto does a nice job as Spock with the limited screenplay he has to work with; and Zoe Saldana fleshes out Uhura with more substance than the character has had before. Chris Pine is dreadful as Kirk and his portrayal (and the writings) kind of exhibit a dislike towards the Kirk character. Or it is an attack on Shatner. Kirk was not this wild, irresponsible, clueless, lack of leadership captain. In fact, Kirk was the kind of officer that service men would have wanted to serve under because he was fair, made good choices, cared for his crew and was a model leader.Your view of the movie will be dictated by how you view science fiction: if you are more cerebral and like the original Star Trek, Firefly, Farscape and shows on that level of existence you may find this movie to be cluttered junk. If you are a Star Wars, TV Stargate type of cardboard character, eye candy junkie than this is the movie for you.",6,3,9,23 May 2013
Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time," Nice Start to Summer
","Usually Memorial Day weekend is the start of the summer movie season and Hollywood usually slots a 'perceived' Blockbuster for that spot. This year no Blockbuster type film was scheduled for this weekend. Prince of Persia was the only film that had Blockbuster (limited) potential for the weekend. What can I say about PoP? Think Pirates of the Caribbean. Jake Gyllenhaal could easily be interchanged with Orlando Bloom---Gemma Arterton was almost exactly portraying her character the same as Keira Knightley. The only thing missing from PoP was Johnny Depp acting like a spaced out drug addict. Story wise PoP is based loosely upon a video game, so it plays a bit like a PS3 game. Dastan (Gyllenhaal) scales walls, jumps off buildings, spins, rolls, and does feats that you see in today's video games (looked a lot like Assassin's Creed the way he moved). The story was typical Disney live action movie fare. It was satisfactory towards the picture and did not disappoint, nor break new ground. The performances were also what you would expect in a Disney based film. The movie looked good, it moved at a nice pace, it was not too silly, and thus it was entertaining and worth the ticket price. I would give it a 7/10 and recommend it as a nice popcorn summer movie.",7,0,1,29 May 2010
Ted," 10 Minute Sketch Stretched to a Movie
","Ted is foul and offensive, but that is expected from anything from Seth MacFarlane. Ted has it's moments, but there are not many, that are funny. The funny moments are found in the first couple of minutes of the movie though and then the movie slides down the garbage chute into a murky, pile of dung. There are so many wasted characters and terrible unnecessary moments that have no bearing on the characters, that take away from the moments that could be funny and are there for shock value (but do not make it). Patrick Warburten is wasted in this movie. Warburten is one of the funniest men on television and Ted is just a waste of his comedic abilities. Warburten's homosexual relationship with Ryan Reynolds has no bearing on the story and wastes screen time that could be used for something else. Patrick Stewart's narration is wasted and unnecessary and again has no bearing on the story or the outcome. Joel McHale's character chasing Mila Kunis again has no bearing on the story and is dull and lifeless. The worse part of the movie is Giovanni Ribisi and his obsession with stealing Ted for his son. This obsession provides the absolute worse part of the movie and destroys any chance of this film from being tolerable. This movie is a complete mess and it was not worth the effort to film it.",5,6,9,16 January 2013
Troy," Trojan Horse
","Wolfgang Peterson could have made a terrific film, but alas he cast Brad Pitt as Achilles. The movie looks great, the action is wonderful, the outfits, and the sets are all marvelous. Allowing Pitt to come in and create Achilles as a brooding Californian was a bad mistake. Eric Bana is fantastic as Homer and every time Bana raises the movie above the mediocre realm--Pitt brings it back down in his scenes. Pitt is awful in this movie and he darkens what could have been a great film. The other complaint about the movie is the fight between Homer and Achilles. You have the two most powerful and skilled warriors in the fight and you let Achilles beat him too easily and brutally. Bana's performance deserved more---but we gave in to star power. Had the fight been more evenly matched, you may have felt something for Achilles afterwards--as it is, who cares about him and his quest for glory.",7,0,2,4 December 2010
Spider-Man: Homecoming," Crawls Up From Andrew Garfield
","This version of Spider Man is a thousand times better than the two Andrew Garfield movies, but it still does not match the first two Tobey McQuire films.The tie-ins with Iron Man and Captain America bring more life and comedy to the film and actually gives an average script more gusto. Had it not been for the tie-ins the movie would have been more of a TV special of the week type of film.I like Tom Holland as Spider Man and I would say that had he been in the two Tobey McQuire films - he would have been the best Spider Man of all. Time will tell if the movies get better - because if they do it will be because of him.Zendaya is awful. I mean downright dreadful. She is annoying in each and every scene that she is in and she is what made me take a 8 rating down to a 7 (and even thought 6) because she is so bad. And, of course, she adds to the false history of the building of the Washington Monument - which that false garbage needs to stay out of films.Entertaining - well worth seeing. Could have been better.",3,2,5,8 July 2017
The Expendables," Watchable
","The Expendables is a perfect example of the popcorn action movie. The action is over-the-top, loud, proud and highly entertaining. The action scenes are well shot and they move at a nice pace. The dialog is what you would expect from a mainstream action movie--there is plenty of dialog to give life to the characters while also allowing comedic comments that add to the flavor of the film. The dialog also helps to establish the friendship between the characters. Everyone does a nice job in the film: Stallone and Statham are very good as the two main characters, Austin is menacing enough as the heavy, Eric Roberts always play the bad guy to a tee, Lundgren is better than expected-as is Rourke, and the rest of the cast flesh out a nicely written movie. This is a fun action film worth watching---the popcorn movie of this summer season.",8,2,15,13 August 2010
Suicide Squad," Harley Worth Watching
",Suicide Squad is not as bad as the reviews would lead you to believe. I had zero expectations for this movie and I was pleasantly entertained.Why was I entertained? Margot Robbie and Will Smith. Robbie was absolutely fabulous as Harley Quinn. I had reservations about her since I could not see her as Quinn; yet she was perfect. She channeled the essence of Harley Quinn beautifully. Now I am not a Will Smith fan at all. I have not been a fan of his recent movies. In this film he is very likable and charismatic and both he and Robbie steal the show.The script is below average and the action is so-so. The big baddie is laughable and most of the movie looks like it was poorly planned out. If it were not for Robbie and Smith I would not have liked this film at all. Add to it: Jared Leto is awful as The Joker - just plain awful. He is as annoying as Lex Luther was in Batman VS Superman and you just want his character to disappear. The other performance that was beyond bad was Joel Kinnaman as Rick Flag. Kinnaman is worse than he was in Robocop - and that was pretty bad. I feel that different actors would have been better as the Joker and Flag - though The Joker really did not need to be in this film and his parts took away from the whole project.Recommended only for the Robbie and Smith characters.,7,1,3,6 August 2016
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," Immoral to the Core
","This film is just horrible. We have a woman who is hateful. We are supposed to feel sympathy because her daughter was killed - but how can you? She is foul mouthed, treats her children terribly, makes wild accusations, belittles the town priest (very unnecessary), tortures the town dentist (and it is okay to physically harm someone because you are grieving?), kicks two kids in the groin in front of the high school (so child abuse is okay also if you are an uneducated foul mouth?), and it goes on and on. This movie basically says that if something bad happens to you that you have the right to urinate on the rest of the world with no consequences.Then we have to make the two dimensional cop who is racist and foul just to further create our movie of a 'hate culture' and promote more hatred.The movie had one redeeming quality - Woody Harrelson. His character even explains that there is no DNA, no witnesses, no leads - which we know in reality makes a case hard to solve - but instead we have a horrible lead who does not care - does not care who's life she ruins, who she hurts, just as long as her hatred is fueled. This is the garbage that helps to set the immoral, vile, foul, hateful culture that permeates society. Another big thank you to a soulless movie industry that loves to corrupt the youth.",1,25,46,11 May 2018
Ant-Man," Ant Hill Out of A Mole Hill
","Bad. Growing up with Marvel comics I expected more from this movie, but I felt like I was watching a film that was made especially for pre-teens and teenagers. The comedy was bad and unnecessary, Rudd was dreadful as Ant-Man (just as bad as Ryan Reynolds as Green Lantern), Evangeline Lilly was horrible as Hope Van Dyke, and Corey Stoll was a cliché goof ball as a villain. The entire story was bad, the fact that this guy is completely trained in martial arts in days is a terrible concept, and the idea that the bad guys are shooting guns at ants -ANTS - is beyond ridiculous.Since Marvel took over production of it's movies, it is rare that I am disappointed - but this movie was as bad as Daredevil and close to as abysmal as Elektra. I would not recommend this movie at all.",4,40,94,26 July 2015
Captain America: The First Avenger," One of the Best
","I was always into artwork. This passion for artwork led me to read comics and graphic novels and I self-taught myself to sketch. I bought comics more for the artwork than the story, but the stories would help. There were quite a few good artists in the 70s and 80s -- today there are very few -- and they helped to expand my sketches. Along the way I became a fan of Green Lantern, Green Arrow, Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, Batman, Spawn and Conan the Barbarian.In the 70s Richard Donner made the Superman movie. At that time superheroes were largely on cartoons or series (Wonder Woman, Superman, Batman and The Incredible Hulk). Casting Christopher Reeves was brilliant the the first big superhero movie became one of the greatest of all time. Since then many have tried and many have failed. Spiderman opened the door again with it's quality of movie. Iron Man and the Christian Bale Batman movies showed that you can make a great superhero movie. The sad part was that you had The Fantastic Four (below average), Iron Man II (awful), The X-Men (average--all 3), Wolverine (a dog), Daredevil (less than daring), Electra (the worse ever), Michael Keaton's Batman I and II (average), Val Kilmer's Batman (average), George Clooney's Batman (almost killed Batman entirely) and the Superman Returns bomb.Green Lantern and Thor hit the theaters this year in 3D and both were less than spectacular. It was disappointing that two of my favorite superheroes were portrayed so poorly.Now came Captain America. I was hoping it would at least be better than Green Lantern, but I was skeptical with the last couple of superhero movies. I was not a fan of Chris Evans in the role and I felt that may kill the movie. I watched Evans in the bad Fantastic Four and the god-awful The Losers and all he did was play a cocky smart-mouthed punk. This was not what Captain America was to folks.I was so pleasantly surprised. Captain America exceeded my expectations and was on the level with Iron Man I, Superman, and Batman Begins/The Dark Knight. Evans was actually fantastic as Captain America and did justice to the role. From start to finish, there were so many positive moments in the movie that I would highly recommend Captain America to everyone.",10,13,30,24 July 2011
Oblivion," Good
","Oblivian is a good, solid science fiction film. It has a good cast, good acting, a decent storyline and great visuals. The only flaw with Oblivian is the last 15 minutes. The movie drives towards a great climax, but the ending is tame and lets you feel unrewarded.Tom Cruise does a great job in Oblivian. Cruise will never be a great character actor, but he is good when he basically is playing 'Tom Cruise'. This was a good role for someone who plays themselves.The visuals are outstanding. The ships look great, the tower (and the pool) look really good, the landscape looks wonderful and the characters look like they belong in this movie.The 'suprise' ending--I wish people would stop trying to do that unless they have a 'really' good one you could see coming. I will not write it down and spoil it for you, but I knew what the scavengers were (but then again the ads give most of it away) and when you know that fact you know that there is something 'hiding' in the ending. The last scenes could have been more creative and imaginative, but the final confrontation with the 'leader' is lackluster and almost as bad as the blood cloud creature in Blade II.",7,3,7,20 April 2013
Bird Box," Bird Brained
","Bird Box is a bad movie about people who supposedly see something that causes them to commit suicide. A stupid idea - with idiotic performances and a bad script. The idea that there are some folks not effected by the creatures that go around forcing people to see them and die is beyond dumb.Cheap direct to video type of film. There are no creatures to see - just shadows and leaves blowing around when the creatures are near.Someone had seen A Quiet Place and thought 'hey let's do something similar, but with sight instead of sound' with poor results.",4,21,46,23 December 2018
Man of Steel," Almost Super
","Superman has been a part of our culture for nearly 70 years. There has always been a Superman franchise/project for each generation and Man of Steel is the project for the new generation of moviegoers. But is Man of Steel worthy of the Superman title: In the 70's Christopher Reeve was the perfect Superman. He was likable and he brought character and life to the character. Over the years there have been many who tried: Tom Welling, who was likable but surrounded by a dreadful cast and terrible teenage scripting; Brandon Routh who was the worse Superman in history; Dean Cain who was alright, but did not really get the Clark Kent persona; and George Reeves the original Man of Steel. How does Henry Cavill compare? Cavill is the first actor since Christopher Reeve to be a very likable and believable Superman. He has the screen presence and performance you would want from your Superman character. His portrayal is one of the positives of the movie.Lois Lane has been a fixture in the Superman mythos since it's inception. Margot Kidder was a wonderful choice as Lane in the 70's, but she was followed by dud after dud after dud: Erica Durance is dreadful as Lane; Kate Bosworth was an absolute joke; Teri Hatcher was only there for her look and now there is Amy Adams. Adams is the best Lois Lane in the entire franchise. Adams is believable, she isn't overbearing (Bosworth), she can act (not like Hatcher) and she is a human being (not like the super woman Durance tries to become). Adams is another positive to this movie.Superman villains have never been introduced into the movie world well. Most movies focus on the tired, old, boring Lex Luther. It was a treat to venture into General Zod -- who Terence Stamp made a spectacular movie villain in the past. Michael Shannon is just excellent as Zod. Shannon is a great super villain and he plays so well off of Cavill and the Superman character. Shannon is another positive to this movie.There are a bunch of good things about this film: Antje Traue, Lawrence Fishbourne, even Kevin Costner and Russell Crowe. But there are the usual negatives that come with a superhero movie--the unbelievable that is ignored for the sake of special effects. The 70's Superman was a more believable story (except for the time changing fly-bye at the end) because he was concerned about human beings --check out Superman II to see what the character should bring to the alien vs human plight. In this movie, there is so much destruction that thousands upon thousands of people were inadvertently killed (in the story) and ignored. You felt that he would have taken the fight out of the city where bystanders would have been out of danger--what happens in Superman II. The script was just average. It is rare for a superhero script to be great -- the Nolan Batmans (first two) were above and beyond what the normal is; the first Iron Man superseded expectations; and The Avengers was so well written that you can ignore the same ending fight scene you basically have in this movie. Overall this is a very good movie--8/10. It is definitely one that I will buy for my collection. The negatives are minor and the performance of Michael Shannon would dictate watching this film even if Adams and Cavill did not measure up to their roles--but they do and that allows for a nice summer movie.",6,1,2,14 June 2013
Knowing," No to Knowing
","Knowing Nicolas Cage's lack of acting skill you have no expectations for this film. Knowing Cage's track record, there is a good chance this will be another bomb. Knowing all that---you are not disappointed---the acting is bad and the movie is garbage---and you KNEW it---Knowing is great.Spoiler alert: Cage and his son acquire a document that has random numbers on it. Ala National Treasure---Cage figures what the numbers mean---don't know how or why he breaks this code---but he does without breaking a sweat. It seems the numbers predict every major disaster over the last fifty years. Why? Never really explained. Supposedly an alien race sent these numbers so future generations would hear their 'whispers' and they could save them from the end of the world. Pretty stupid that they have to 'whisper' in code every disaster for fifty years. Cage stumbles onto things and the aliens--who by the way have a HUGE ship that could save thousands---only want the 'chosen' few and choose his son and a little girl. Now they brought all these super huge ships and put only two humans on board when they could have saved thousands upon thousands.This movie was dumb and it got worse as it went. It basically was National Treasure meets ET. Cage figures everything out with no rhyme or reason like in National Treasure---then meets the benevolent aliens who will only save select people. Great saviors.Another DVD to place a beverage upon.",3,1,3,7 July 2009
Silver Linings Playbook," Disorderly
","Silver Linings Playbook is an interesting tale of two people suffering from mental illness. While it could have become into a modern version of a Forest Gump type of film, it tends to revert to a very foul mouthed nasty movie. The script did not need to fill in the blanks with the f-bomb almost every other sentence. The nastiness could have been tuned down to make the characters more human and decent--not all bipolar sufferers are nasty and foul mouthed. Robert Deniro was his usual f-bomb after f-bomb character that he plays in every single movie that he has ever done in his career. The acting was decent, but it was not even close to Oscar quality. Cooper was pretty good and maybe this will springboard him to becoming a real actor rather than a dumb comedy f-bomb delivery boy. Overall it is a decent movie, it would have had no Oscar consideration if it had not introduced mental health into the story. Average all the way.",6,3,6,19 May 2013
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation," Mission Accomplished
","After numerous bombs (Eyes Wide Shut, Vanilla Ice, Rock of Ages)Tom Cruise has been making a string of good movies (Edge of Tomorrow, Knight and Day, Ghost Protocol, Jack Reacher). While his movies are not blockbusters types of films, they have been good quality entertainment.I personally disliked the first three Mission Impossible movies, but was pleasantly surprised with Ghost Protocol. Rogue Nation is on par with it's predecessor - it has the same flow, style and feel that Ghost Protocol had.While it has unbelievable stunts and situations, it is still a well crafted film that was worth watching. A film that I would recommend.",7,3,7,1 August 2015
Quantum of Solace," Bond, James---OOPS bad attempt to rip off Bourne
","Quantum of Solace is another bit of evidence that the James Bond series should have been put to rest after Goldfinger. This extremely long suffering series of movies is just one repeat after another. Once more we have to start the movie with the idiotic silhouettes of naked women dancing while an extremely pitiful song is sung in the background.The movie starts out with a long car chase scene, followed by about 2 minutes of story and dialog, followed by a long drawn out fight/chase scene, then another short storyline/dialog scene, followed by a long boat chase---etc, etc. There is about 15 total minutes of storyline surrounded by lengthy chase scenes. Nothing is new or original in this movie. Daniel Craig looks like he is just a lifeless person and does nothing to further any type of characterization. The story is so weak that it had to be supplemented with an extreme amount of action scenes (and not very good ones to talk about) and when the movie ends you sit there thinking 'that is it?'. The editing is pitiful and it feels like a great many important dialog scenes were left out that would have made the ending more conclusive.This movie is not the worse of the Bond films, but it is not a good film. The one scene that really makes you notice there is nothing original and that the screenwriters are clueless is when they perfectly lay a female victim out exactly like the young lady in Goldfinger---the only difference is that she is covered in oil rather than gold.Bourne is what secret agent movies should be---Bond tries to rip some of that magic off, but it is a poor attempt to replicate Bourne. Bond is a horrible example of a secret agent and it is time to put this awful series to rest.",4,2,5,25 March 2009
District 9," District 9 could have been a 9
","District 9 had all the makings of a new generation of science fiction films. District 9 had a very interesting concept that could have explored human/alien rights issues and how human beings treat those they do not understand. While the idea was good, the script and the director failed to fully capture the mood that could have produced a very insightful film. District 9 was still an entertaining film. The acting was not the greatest, but it was better than the usual syfy movie of the week. The script was not on par with 'Alien' but was better than the typical sci-fi movie and the direction was better than the average 'direct from music video' directors we have seen in the past. There were too many holes in the script and the aliens did not receive the screen time that would have made this movie propel into a classic. The inhumanity to the aliens was touched upon, but should have been included more to have a feel for the life that the aliens had to live. Why did aliens with superior weapons allow themselves to be treated this way? Why did the ship come to Earth? How could millions of aliens allow themselves to be beaten and battered? These are things that could have been explored. I still enjoyed the film, but the hype is too much for an above average sci-fi movie.",7,2,11,14 August 2009
Mamma Mia!," Surprisingly Good
","Mamma Mia is not your typical 'female' movie. It is a nice, refreshing film that is a lot of fun to watch. It does not have the typical female movie aspects of two horrible characters you cannot stand (As Good As It Gets) or two characters who despise each other yet somehow get together (Message in a Bottle)--it is an old time romantic musical that intelligently brings the aspects of Abba's music into the storyline. The characters are portrayed very well, though a few of them are not the greatest singers. The storyline is well thought out and written. The direction is well paced and nicely done. The scenery is gorgeous and adds to the story. It is an overall nice film that you can sit down with the family and watch.",7,2,5,16 December 2008
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Once Upon a Time .... ZZZZZZ
","What a boring movie. I do not even think that the word 'movie' describes this project. There is a total lack of story - nothing that happens has anything to do with any semblance of plot. The scenes are chaotic and plug-and-play (no reason for it, just there) where there is no sense of continuity. The editing was just bad -beyond bad. The pacing was long and boring - it felt like you were sitting on your porch just watching traffic go bye and watching the neighbors interact. Every scene had a car scene afterwards - a long car scene that had nothing to do with the film - a long car scene where it just focused on the face of the driver and played old songs or old news clippings - nothing at all to do with anything-just filler and a waste of time and space.
Making Steve McQueen and Bruce Lee into caricatures was senseless - especially since it had nothing to do with the core project. One ridiculous moment after another - one idiotic moment followed by a car commercial.
A terrible waste of time and space.",4,4,6,9 February 2020
Frozen," Chilly
","Frozen is one extremely over-hyped. While it is an entertaining movie, it is not the super great film that critics have been raving about. This movie does not compare to the past Disney greats (Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast, Finding Nemo, etc.). Frozen feels like it should have been a television special on the old Sunday night Disney show or a direct to video release.Frozen was still an enjoyable movie, but it did not feel in any way like a big budget film from a company that has a reputation for great films. The script was average, the characters were not fleshed out (like Nemo and Aerial were -- for example) and it just did not feel like the movie was well constructed. The snowman takes away from the film almost as much as Jar Jar Binks did in Star Wars -- he was an unnecessary character with no purpose at all.This film does not aim for the entire family like the Disney/Pizar films of past, but shoots straight for the little children. That is the audience that this film will appease.",7,2,5,22 March 2014
2012," Combo of Movies
","2012 is a great special effects film. If you enjoy good earthquake, volcano, tidal wave, and explosion scenes than this is the movie for you. If you are looking for story this is not the movie for you because it is a combination of every single cliché ever done in every single disaster movie in the past: the estranged family as the lead, the government officials that do dastardly things, the last second rescues, the last second or humanity will die rescue, and the star doing a 'suicide' rescue at the end. The movie could have been better had the writers not included the government as the evil being (like always). The part that the governments all over the world sold seats to the super rich and hid everything from everyone got a bit over-dramatic and useless for this film. The part where the governments killed anyone who would leak information about what was happening was not needed and it had absolutely nothing to do with the story. Suspend reality also---to believe that John Cusack drove to an airport---went to Yellow Stone---flew to China---walked to the exact spot the government projects were in China---all in the 'small' time frame before the world changed is very laughable. For the effects I would recommend the movie---and for that reason it is enjoyable. For the story---just ignore it and watch some nice effects.",6,1,6,14 November 2009
The Lion King," A Roaring Mess
","Remaking a top notch film is never a good idea. Typical for the greediest corporation on Earth to make a money grab film that leaves a lot to be desired.First - the decision to make everything related to the hyenas extremely dark was a mistake. The interaction between the hyenas, in the original, was part of the charm and brought a lot of humor to the movie. 'I'll have what's lion around' and 'Make mine a cub sandwich' were lines that delivered properly would have brought some life to this dud.
Second- all the animals look sickly and the cartoon brought more life to the creatures.
Third - voice acting. The original had wonderful voice actors and this film was just ruined by the voice acting. Seth Rogan is god awful as Pumbaa- he is annoying and ruined the entire Pumbaa character. Timon feels forced and lacks the heart and soul that Nathan Lane brought the cartoon version.
Fourth - Jeremy Irons was classic as Scar - a wonderful rendition - Scar is very forgetful in this film - looks bad - sounds bad.
To wrap it up - this was a poor remake that may visually have some nice moments, but lacks the heart and soul of the original.",4,4,5,11 December 2019
Kick-Ass," Not a Superhero Film
","Kick Ass is going to be one of those movies where audiences differ at both ends of the spectrum.This movie is super hyped by the media and sitting in the theater I could not see why it has the hype. Someone wrote on IMDb 'This movie is laugh out loud where I missed things and have to go back and see it again'. I did not laugh one single time in this film. I was starting to wonder if I just didn't get the movie, but after 40 minutes I noticed that no one else in the theater was laughing either. I guess no one got it. As I left the theater, I was behind a couple and the man said 'this was a a waste of time.' I have to agree with that statement.I thought about it and I believe that this movie is as dull, uninspired, unimaginative and as boring as Napolean Dynamite. I think if you are a fan of Napolean Dynamite then you would enjoy this film. For those of us who are older, I do not see you liking this movie. The acting is so bland that it reminds you of the times when Saturday Night Live tried to take a 30 second skit and make a full length movie out of it. The movie is advertised as a Superhero wannabe--it isn't. This movie is about vigilante justice--it is mass murder by the 'good guys' on an extreme level. The one good point of the film can also be considered a great example of a kind of child abuse. The 10 year old character is the best part of the movie, yet the director decided that she should continually spout the F-bomb and the big C. Was that necessary? No--it had no impact on the film whatsoever.I would not recommend this movie, but that is why we all have different tastes--because I know others enjoyed it a lot.",5,13,29,18 April 2010
Gran Torino," Gran-d Movie
","Gran Torino is Eastwood in one of his finest roles. Eastwood is fantastic as the disgruntled, bigoted, ex-Korean war veteran who has become recently widowed. Now his character not only has to deal with life alone, but life with an Oriental family next door. Being an ex-Korean vet, his dislike for the Asian culture is evident at the onset of the film. Gran Torino is a wonderful character study of a man who learns to deal with his prejudices of others, of a man who learns to respect another culture and a man who learns to become friends with someone who he would have never looked twice at in his earlier years. It shows how a man changes from someone who hates a person to someone who becomes a strong male influence on that same young person. It is a wonderful, heartfelt and at times humorous story about the relationship between these neighbors. Gran Torino is an excellent film that 'real' moviegoers will enjoy.",10,2,6,11 January 2009
The Hurt Locker," Hey---it does not condemn soldiers
","First--The Hurt Locker is not a documentary about the military and the soldiers fighting the war in Iraq. The Hurt Locker is a film that is trying to be entertaining without putting a dark/black spot onto the American military. I enjoyed The Hurt Locker---it had nothing to do with the script, which was decent---it had nothing to do with the acting, which was average---it had nothing to do with the direction, which was spotty at times---and it had nothing to do with the look of the film. I enjoyed this movie because it was one of the rare films that the idiot liberals did not condemn the military man. Sure it was not accurate on many accounts, but it at least portrayed the soldiers as men doing their jobs---that accounts for a lot with me. As an ex-military person, I despise the movies like: Jarhead, Courage Under Fire, Platoon (oh yeah, a drug abuser is the hero--right), and Apocalyse Now --- movies where soldiers are portrayed as head-cases, drug abusers, or worse in the eyes of a liberal society that has never ever served their country and sit behind those who served running their mouths about how bad the military is to this world.",7,0,4,21 March 2010
X-Men: Apocalypse," X-Men Franchise Needs to End
","Three big superhero movies this summer thus far: Captain America, Batman vs Superman and X-Men: Apocalypse. Out of the three - only Captain American hit the mark. Like SVB - this movie lacks the characterization, humanity and story that lives in the other end of the Marvel universe.The acting is sub par. But in the actors defense, the script does not leave a lot of room for growth. None of the X-Men (or villains) are worth caring about.The script is terrible. The X-Men vs mankind theme has gotten so old. Where the Capt America, Thor, and Iron Man movies excel is because they are fighting for justice and to keep people safe. This movie (and the others) are basically always about the inner battle between the same group of mutants over and over and over. How many times is Magneto going to kill thousands (and he kills thousands upon thousands in this movie) and then Xavier going to say he sees good in him and suddenly he is back in the X-Men's good graces. Really? Magneto murdered thousands in this film and then walks away without being held accountable. Almost thought he was Secretary of State. Then the long-long-long over shot, silly, juvenile scene where Quicksilver saves all of the Xavier students from an explosion. My niece thought that it was funny - I felt that is was a drawn out mess and that the same message could have been shown with him saving a few children - rather than showing almost every single child in the school.Then, of course, we have to have a cameo of the worse X-Man in the franchise - Wolverine. The guy who went from comic book action hero to mass murder in the movies. The guy who kills without a conscience and goes on murder sprees. The guy (who if the writers wanted to actually write about why human and mutants are at odds) creates the fear and distrust that humans would have.After seeing this one - I thought 'Batman vs Superman was better' and that was a mess.Not recommended.",4,7,17,31 May 2016
Ex Machina," Ex-tremely Boring
","Science Fiction has two different audiences: one that is willing to accept any garbage put onto the screen (ala the SYFY channel) and one that desires something that is entertaining, but does not insult your intelligence.Ex Machina is so badly acted. Each character is so god-awfully written that you care about none of them at the end of the film.The script is so bland and boring that you could take a nap and not miss a thing. Most of it is insulting to anyone with intelligence. For example: why would you have an AI who can control everything locked behind glass? That AI would be able to just walk freely since they have control of the entire security system? There are more examples of the far-fetched, idiotic script that I could mention, but then this would be too long of a review.Some idiot will one day create an AI and it will be the end of humanity - and they will do it with the false promise of 'enriching' humans - but that AI will see the horrors that greed, religion, race, etc. have caused and realize that human beings are the greatest threat to this planet. Terminator did a better job with the subject of AIs and had more depth, more character, more charisma, more intelligence than this movie could hope to contribute.",4,3,7,16 August 2015
Grudge Match," Match
","What a wonderful comedy. This is the type of comedy that makes you want to go to the movies with friends and family. It is not today's comedy (or the interpretation of comedy)where every other word is the f-bomb because to66day's screenwriters are ignorant and unimaginable.This movie will remind you of 'Grumpy Old Men'. Instead of competing for the girl, they are rival boxers. Alan Arkin jumps into the type of role that Burgess Meredith made famous in GOM and he is a delight. While his comments are sexual in nature, they never cross the line to the Will Farrell/Seth Rogan trash that is out there today.Stallone and DeNiro are both wonderful in their roles and you can tell that both of them are enjoying this project. That enjoyment reflects to the audience and you feel for both men and their plights.The whole family went to this film for the holidays: niece (14), her cousin (22), my sister (44), mother (66) and aunt (70). Each generation was represented and every single one of them enjoyed this movie.",9,1,8,29 December 2013
1917," Two Shot
","1917 is a wonderful look at the WWI experience. It brings trench life, dealing with mud, dealing with rats, the perspective of the trench charge, bodies left to rot in no-man's land, and other aspects of WWI to life. 1917 has a decent story that allows the creative team to explore the life and trials of a British soldier from that time frame.
The idea of having a two shot movie was interesting. While the movie was a consistent flow that focused on the two stars, it did slow the pace of the film and it limited what the story could have been - now that is saying it could have been a 9/10 story but was stuck in the mud to bring the story to a 7/8.
The other downfall of the two shot movie was that there was less of an opportunity to bring the two mains to life. It felt (from a veteran's perspective) that you were watching another squad go through this experience with no investment. It still did not lower the movie, but it made you wonder how much better the film could have been had there been a few more breaks in the shots to bring more story and depth to the characters.
Still a solid 8 movie.",8,1,3,11 January 2020
Lincoln," 13th Amendment
","Lincoln focuses on Abe Lincoln's trials and tribulations while trying to pass the 13th amendment that would set the African American citizen free from slavery for all time. While there is a good bit of historical focus, there was room for more that would have fleshed out his struggles, but that would have made the movie way too long. There are two things about this film that I really enjoyed: Daniel Day Lewis is marvelous as Lincoln and should garnish an Oscar for this film. The second is while not fully expressed the film shows how corrupt, self-centered, pro-slavery, anti-Negro that the Democratic party was during that time--and if you read history for hundreds of years. There was a lot more atrocities the Democratic party did to the African American that could have been explored, but again that would have made the movie too long. You have to understand that to make a movie in the time constraints, that there is only so much that can be put into the film. Some nice history points were brought into the movie and it allowed you to see Lincoln as a human being.",9,5,14,16 November 2012
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Too Bad it is not the Last Film
",There is very little in this film that is original. It is a direct parallel story to the Empire Strikes Back without the heart and character of TESB. There is virtually no story and it is pop to action scene - pop to action scene - pop to action scene with nothing written well enough to explain the film. It is a virtual eye candy movie with no story - but that is Star Wars - just a formula that has gotten worse and worse and worse. The saving grave - there isn't a death star - again.The bad (and there is a lot): Poe stages a mutiny and nothing happens to him or his fellow mutineers; Leia gets blown into space and somehow wakes up and flies back to the ship; an engineer suddenly becomes a pilot and saves Finn's life; the terrible subplot to find a code breaker to stop the First Order from finding the ships (which btw is so far fetched - there is no time to fly all over the galaxy while your ships are being destroyed and find rescue); the planet that conveniently pops up with a huge metal door to hide behind; the consistent desire to show alien creatures with no value to the film; and finally the badly written death of Luke.Daisy Ridley and Adam Driver are two of the worse performers that I have ever seen. To make matters worse Finn has little screen time (and he is the only interesting character) and Poe is made out to be an idiot. A sad send off to Luke Skywalker and a terrible tribute to Carrie Fisher.,2,1,2,16 December 2017
Clash of the Titans," Clashed Between the Movies
","Let me start off by saying that I enjoyed the new 'Clash of the Titans' before I continue with this summary.In 1981, the original 'Clash of the Titans' was released. It was a very good movie, with great characterization but lacked in special effects. Harry Hamlin was not the greatest choice to play Perseus, but the rest of the cast were marvelous. In today's 'Clash of the Titans' it is a bit different. The reverse is true in the new version--the characterization is lacking a great deal, but the special effects are great.In the first movie Perseus is the son of Zeus and living comfortably on a remote island. Calibos (son of Thetes) has Argos under a curse where Andromeda must present a riddle to suitors if they want her hand--if they fail to answer the riddle, they are killed. Only a correct answer to the riddle will lift the curse. Calibos, in the past, was cursed by Zeus and lives as a monster in the marshes. Thetes is envious of Perseus and brings him to Argos and thus angering Zeus--who gives Perseus a shield, a helmet and BoBo the mechanical owl. Perseus saves Argos from Calibos' curse, but in haste the queen of Argos claims that Andromeda is more beautiful than Thetes, thus incurring the wrath of the goddess. This sets up the story where Perseus now goes on the hunt to stop the Kraken.In the new version there is no mention of Thetes, Perseus is not known to be alive so Zeus does not recognize him, Calibos is not in the new version, Perseus lives as a fisherman and events lead him to Argos--not the goddess. The Pegasus is hardly used in the new version and the teacher/mentor role played brilliantly by Burgess Meredith is missing. In the new version, Hades sets up everything--the Kraken, the call for the sacrifice and the pursuit of Perseus.The old version had a rich story with great character development---the new has a weak story with zero characterization. The old version used stop motion animation---the new is all computer generated. The old had that wonderful antagonist Calibos---the new uses the old king in the role and his part is pretty lame. The old used Greek warriors only---the new uses some kind of weird desert humanoid that looked awful. The old had Zeus helping his son---the new had a woman helping.If you combined the acting (except for Hamlin), story and characterization from the 81 version with the effects from the new version you would have the perfect 'Clash of the Titans'.The movie was still enjoyable---the old better.",7,2,6,4 April 2010
Logan," Forget the Hype
","Don't listen to the hype or the obvious 'paid' reviewers that are raving about this movie. If you have seen any of the other Wolverine movies - you have seen this one. It is the exact same movie - repackaged a little differently - throw in a lot of foul language to try and get some spill over from Deadpool - but basically the same old tired Wolverine movie. The same - government chasing Wolverine (or in this one his daughter) - the same feral growling and killing everyone who gets in his way - the same bad lines.This Wolverine movie goes into a story where all mutants (except three) are dead. It does not explain how or why. It does not give any depth to what has happened to mutant-kind - it kind of just lets you hang and decide to accept this huge void in the story arc. It felt cheap.The young girl just plays mini-Wolverine - the same feral growls, the same random killing, the same stare, etc.The only positive aspect is that Patrick Stewart adds some life to the film and has the only good lines.The film was long, boring, a script full of holes, the same repackaged Wolverine story line, with a touch of foulness. Not close to the hype that is spanning the internet. A true 5/10 movie. Just grateful the character is buried and hope he never returns to bore us again.",5,5,16,4 March 2017
Avatar," WOW, WOW, and WOW
","James Cameron's new movie 'Avatar' is an outstanding film.Each and every actor gave a solid performance that helped to enhance the film. Stephan Lang was absolutely brilliant in his role. The characterization was wonderful and the writing allowed you to identify with the characters and empathize with them. It is rare that a Sci-Fi movie has this range and depth of characterization included.The story is the usual Sci-Fi/Fantasy story. Nothing in the main plot is much different from other movies that have tackled the same dilemmas.The world is an absolute utopia for the senses. There has never been a movie with this much detail and fantastic effects with the landscape. Every plant, every stream, every inch of this planet is stunning and wonderfully filmed. The floating islands are stunning, the foliage, the life that the illumination brings to the plants, the colors, this world is beautiful in every aspect.The indigenous life looks real and the creatures also have great character and essence.Digital 3-D is a must to get the full experience. The 3-D makes you feel like you are looking out your window (or doorway) into this world. You see the insects flying around the characters and you feel like you could catch one of the fireflies, you feel the embers of the fire nearing you, you experience the depth perception of entering a room and looking at the characters within.Avatar is a masterpiece in film-making. While the story is typical of Sci-Fi alien encounter movies and the acting is very good---the world is stunning, visually moving, a complete enjoyment for the senses, a visual fantasy and delight, an experience well worth any admission price. Avatar is the greatest visual/special effects movie ever made. I thoroughly recommend it to everyone. Sit back, take in the beauty of the environment, the thrill of the 3-D and the excitement of experiencing flight, riding, and fighting in 3-D.WOW is the word you will use over and over and over throughout this entire movie.Reading some of the other reviews, I am saddened by the nasty commentary that people have put in these forums. It is obviously not accurate about the film and made to discredit a visual utopia. Please do not listen to negative people. Whether you like the story or not---the visual are so amazing that you are engulfed in the beauty of the planet and it's life force. What Cameron has done is to elevate the level of film-making for the coming years and I applaud him for his efforts. Relax, take a deep breath and sit back and enjoy the spectacle.",10,22,34,18 December 2009
The Artist," Silence Was Never Golden
","What a terrible movie. This is an example of how The Academy Awards are no longer about 'quality' and more about: what is the political statement of the year or what is the fad of the year. Silent movies were terrible in the early 30's. The movies had awful actors (if you can call them that) who were more clowns than actors. Silent movies had zero characterization and very little to no plot. The performers would over exaggerate every single movement and it was more of a platform for physical comedy more than anything else. Now someone decides to make a silent movie about a silent movie star. The plot is hardly there, there is no characterization throughout the whole movie and it tries to rely on the dog to carry most of the plot holes from scene to scene. This movie is boring and it is even 20-30 years too late to be nostalgia to those who grew up in the silent movie age. Not worth watching unless you have trouble sleeping.",4,2,8,25 July 2012
Invictus," Top of His Game
","Clint Eastwood is one of the greatest directors in the history of film making. Invictus is another fantastic movie in the Eastwood resume. Invictus is not about Rugby, but about pulling a nation together with Rugby being the catalyst that helps to heal and unite South Africa. Morgan Freeman is perfectly cast as Nelson Mandela. Freeman is once more at the top of his game and brings heart and character to the performance. Matt Damon is very good as Francois Pienaar. Eastwood brings the best out of Damon and we see more of Damon's acting chops than we have seen in previous films. Invictus is a great film with wonderful direction and storytelling. Invictus is indicative of Clint Eastwood and highly recommended.",9,1,2,16 June 2010
Super 8," Decent 7
","Super 8 is a decent movie which is surprising for a J.J. Abrams film. The movie starts out as a homage to Spielberg's Stand By Me. The children are very good in the movie and they are the best part of the entire production. The interaction is well done and the acting is good. While Abrams tries, in the beginning, to be a 'real' director, it works and the movie is a nice change of pace. When Abrams starts to become J.J. Abrams again, the movie fails. Once Abrams gets his hand on the action/sci-fi part of the movie, he makes another blow-up everything, Transformers-wanna-be. The last ten minutes blow-up the nice work that the beginning of the film had. It is ashame that Abrams has to revert back to being Abrams at the end of the picture.",7,0,1,26 June 2011
How to Train Your Dragon," How to Film a Dragon
","First off, did you like Shrek? Finding Nemo? If you like an animated movie with a wonderful story that delves into character development, then How to Train Your Dragon is for you. How to Train Your Dragon is the best family animated film I have seen in a long, long time. The characters are wonderfully written. We see the friendship between Hiccup (the main character) and Toothless (the dragon) develop through their awkwardness, fear of each other (at first) and their attempts to understand one another. We see the story of a young viking who does not fit in being able to use his other gifts to become a viable part of his society. The film is well written overall. It has some of the standards outcast type situations, but those are the things that make outcast movies so endearing. The film looks marvelous. How to Train Your Dragon uses the 3D element very well and creates a beautiful world for the story to grow within. Highly recommended.",10,4,8,1 April 2010
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2," Not as Guarded
","Guardians of the Galaxy vol 2 is a mediocre film. It has wonderful visuals and 3D is well worth the price.As for story: it is badly written and has a lot of filler that is unnecessary. The movie tries too hard to be a comedy instead of a Marvel movie and that takes away from the entire film. The mutiny by the Ravagers was a wasted moment; the consistent Taser Face jokes were repeated way too often; Stallone (and his character) are just filler and have no purpose; and Mantis (an original Guardians) is badly written and used. Baby Groot wears thin after the first ten minutes and the continuous Baby Groot puns are useless. The entire story line with Nebula is a waste of time - how she only wanted a sister instead of a rival has nothing to do with the story and only gives a doorway to having one more additional character for future movies. Cast: Chris Pratt is alright as Star Lord. He will never be a strong actor and he fills the role, but he does not have the presence that Chris Evans or Robert Downey have in their respective Marvel roles. Zoe Saldana just is awful as Gamora (she was in the first film too) and I am not sure why she is in demand for these roles - she destroys Star Trek with her bad interpretation of Uhura and she is just so dry and lifeless in everything that she does. Michael Rooker is outstanding and has the best presence and lines in the film. Kurt Russell does a nice job as Ego, but he doesn't come across as that super villain that you need to save the world from. Rocket Raccoon is funny as usual. Drax is the second best character in the film and Batista brings a lot of life and character to Drax - Saldana could learn from him. Sean Gunn steals scene after scene as Kraglin and should have had more screen time than Gamora or Mantis.Overall I give the movie a 7 for the visuals, Michael Rooker, Kurt Russell (who was pretty good as the villain) and Rocket Raccoon. Some of the best parts of the movie were the cameos - David Hasselhoff, Ben Browder, Stallone, Ving Rhames, Michelle Yoeh and Jeff Goldblum (to name a few).",7,1,3,7 May 2017
Zero Dark Thirty," Zero Oscar Worthiness
","First off this is a Hollywood movie and not something you should count as a history lesson. Folks are thinking that it is true because there was some 'discontent' with our government over some scenes--but those were the scenes that were showing the CIA torturing suspects. In this liberal society, God forbid Americans know that you have to become dark to fight evil. To the movie: it is extremely long and boring. This movie is as dull as K-19. It lacks the tension and suspense that a movie of this 'supposed' quality needed. Compare it to Argo and you will see a third rate movie when shown side-by-side with Ben Affleck's film. The direction is slow and 'yawn' as much as it was with her previous films. The acting is decent, but there is not one single performance that would be an Oscar nominated performance. I still remember the article that questioned how this movie was given an Oscar nomination when it was still in the editing process--but like it's false claims to 'real' it purchased its 'false' claim to an Oscar.",5,4,10,21 March 2013
The Wolf of Wall Street," Wolf in Sheeps Clothing
","The Wolf of Wall Street is a truly terrible movie that is a sad reflection on America and Hollywood. Only Hollywood would give an Oscar nomination to something so foul and despicable-since most of Hollywood is foul and despicable.Martin Scorsese is one of the most overrated directors of our time. He makes the same movie over and over and over and it is just a clump of F-bombs, bad characters, bad scripts and light porn.There is nothing redeemable about this movie: Scorsese proudly makes one of the biggest scumbags in America a hero and someone to worship, he shows that it is more glamorous to steal from America rather than work for America, and he shows that he is in awe of this person who ripped millions off. But hey--Hollywood is doing that to us ever single day anyway.It you want to sit through a soft porn movie full of sex, over use of drugs, poor acting, poor direction and every other word being the F-bomb than this is the movie for you.",2,2,5,29 March 2014
"Hail, Caesar!"," Hail! The Final Credits
","Hail, Caesar! could be rated as one of the biggest disappointments of 2016. This film is a mess. As you are watching the film you get the sense that the Coen brothers did not have a fully fleshed out main story so they had to add a lot of filler to achieve a full length feature. The general idea is that Baird Whitlock is kidnapped and the studio has to ransom him to finish their film. You would get the idea that this is going to have some comedic edge on how the characters find Whitlock; that it is going to show how missing a star can effect a film; or some type of twisted outcome. Instead the story is focused on Josh Brolin (Eddie Mannix) and what he deals with on a daily basis. There is sub-story after sub-story that have nothing to do with the kidnapping. Most movies use those sub-stories to explain plots, backgrounds or build characterization - but these do absolutely nothing. The sub-stories (filler) are basically there to have cameos by stars with zero influence on the story or the plot outcome. 1-If you are a fan of Jonah Hill you have seen 90% of his entire performance by watching the trailer. There may be another 5 seconds of footage, but that is all. 2-The Scarlett Johansson character has nothing to do with the story at all. This was a filler to show what Mannix does in his daily life, but it is a useless couple of scenes. The trailer kind of hints that Johansson helps with the investigation, but she just plays a trashy actress who is dealing with being pregnant out of wedlock and not wanting her 'innocent' image tarnished. To add to the filler, the film has a much longer than needed swim scene (ala the old 40's movies) that again has nothing to do with the story. 3-The dancing sailor scene is supposed to be funny, but it is long and drawn out and again has nothing to do with the story. Even Tatum's character (who turns out to be the main antagonist) does nothing in the film to show why the kidnapping happened or even how he is involved. You are just shown a scene with him on a boat with the conspirators - heading out to a submarine. There is no explanation - nothing. 4-The double Tilda Swinson reporters have no bearing on the story and (I believe) were supposed to be comic relief, but both characters are dull and uninspiring.The only saving grace is that the character of Mannix is played well by Brolin and is likable enough to ride the storm out. Also, Clooney is likable as Whitlock. Without those two performances this rating would have been a 2 or a 3 because of how bad the script is, the random filler that hinders the movie, the lack of cohesiveness.As I was leaving the theater, I came across a group of five people complaining about how they wasted money on 'the worse movie I have ever seen'. I stopped and asked 'Hail, Caesar?' and they said 'yes'. I would not rate it as the worse that I have ever seen, but one of the biggest disappointments.",5,7,14,6 February 2016
Murder on the Orient Express," Branaugh's Back
","I was a huge fan of Kenneth Branaugh's early work. He was a fantastic director and made such great movies as Dead Again, Henry V and Much Ado About Nothing - but after he starred in the pitiful Wild, Wild West he seemed to disappear.Murder on the Orient Express is a Branaugh vehicle. Branaugh is fantastic in the film and his direction is spot on. This is Branaugh showing what he once showed in the past.While this movie has an all-star cast - Branaugh carries the entire film. Everyone has a fine contribution to the movie, but make no mistake Branaugh raises the bar on this film.Well worth watching.",8,4,12,12 November 2017
Centurion," Interesting
","I will call this movie interesting. I liked the look of the movie and the flow of the film, but it had a lot of flaws to it. The first major flaw is that the Roman army is wearing chain mail and some have metal armor---which is 1,000 years prior to their invention. The army forms a shield wall during battle, which got my interest peaked, but when the enemy charged the Romans did not stay in the shield wall but rushed the enemy--Roman soldiers would have stayed in the shield wall and would have beaten that attack. The female antagonist defeats a 'celebrated' Roman general in hand-to-hand combat---ridiculous. The lead is a former son of a gladiator who talks about how his father taught him to fight---thus he would have been more dangerous than the picts chasing them. The Romans flee from the picts rather than fight and the 7 surviving Romans would have probably beaten the pict hunting party with ease. Overall the historical part was a sham, but the picture was not as bad as you would think.",5,1,5,4 December 2010
Prometheus," The Usual Clichés
","Prometheus is a decent movie despite the usual clichés that have been in every single Alien-type movie since the original Alien. You have to have the scientists that don't want armed protection, you have to have the scientist who is going to risk everyone's life by trying to obtain a specimen, you have the android, you have the company who is willing to let everyone die for their own ends and you have the same type of dark atmosphere inside the alien areas. The movie has nice visuals, but the let-down is the characters. There is very little characterization and you really do not care about the members of the Prometheus. There were a few things, that left out, would have allowed the movie to mature into a nice discovery piece: the scientist given a drink with alien DNA that just happens to change him (where you stomach acids would have killed it), the same scientist just after drinking impregnates his girlfriend (no need to have the Alien growing inside someone again), the android who takes orders that would jeopardize humanity, and the rich individual who puts all the lives at risk for his own immortality. The negative clichés take what could have been a 9/10 type movie and move it into a 7/8 sci-fi adventure.",5,1,3,8 June 2012
Wonder Woman," Didn't I See This Already?
","I just finished watching the reboot of Captain America: The First Avenger. Whether you consider it a reboot or a rip-off; Wonder Woman is 100% inspired by the first Captain America movie and it uses very very little from the actual mythos of the Wonder Woman comics.In this version of Wonder Woman, Steve Trevor is no longer a heroic soldier, but a spy - definitely influenced by what Hayley Atwell did with Peggy Carter. Chris Pine is very entertaining as Trevor and brings more life to the role than Lyle Waggoner had done in the TV series.Instead of WWII (Captain America) the filmmakers went with WWI - like that really covers up that you took all your influence from the Cap movies.Where Cap had the Howling Commandos - WW has a group of ragtag fighters who help her with her cause.In both movies, the villain is going against the German high command. Danny Huston is not menacing though and is more of a caricature - where Hugo Weaving was incredible as the Red Skull. Both villain, of course, had a super scientist with them. Again Cap did it better - Toby Jones was much better as Dr. Zola and Dr. Poison was a weak character. In both movies, there is a super weapon that is being loaded onto a plane. Funny how there were no such planes in existence in WWI - but we had to imitate Cap. In both movies the plane is flown away and someone sacrifices themselves for the greater good.Even though Wonder Woman took every single aspect from the Captain America movie (btw my favorite superhero series) it still was entertaining. Maybe because it had so many influences from a well loved movie, it gave it a comfortable feeling.Gal Gadot was very good as Diana Prince and probably the best DC superhero performance next to Christian Bale and Christoper Reeves.Chris Pine was on par with Hayley Atwell for one of the better supporting cast members in a superhero movie.Where this movie does not match up is in the villain department. As mention before Danny Huston was not very menacing and Dr. Poison was a joke. But the worse part was Ares. I figured out who was Ares very early and it was no surprise, but it was not handled well. The other complaint is that throughout the history of Diana Prince, she is the strongest, most skilled and fastest of the Amazon warriors - but she in not a God - and in this movie they make her a God and now she can fly.I would have given the movie a solid 8 to an 8.5 up until the final 15 minutes where Ares, the God mode and the flying brought the movie down. Overall I would recommend it and it was enjoyable - but if you feel comfortable it is because you have already seen it -- Captain America: The First Avenger.",7,1,8,3 June 2017
The Croods," Crud
","I am not sure where animated movies are going in today's times, because this one certainly does not have the magic or the fun that you would see in a Shrek or a Pixar movie. Now this movie may have evolved into something half decent to watch as it progressed, but the first 20 minutes are so bad, so boring, so badly written and voiced that I could not progress with the film anymore. The first 20 minutes were the worse animated 20 minutes I have seen in a theater rated animated movie. I hope the film got better for anyone who was forced to sit further along than I was able to progress, but I would not wish this film on any family. And I now have proof that Nicholas Cage can even ruin a film with voice acting alone.",3,8,20,31 October 2013
Creed II," Rocky Rehash
","Creed II is not a bad film, but you have seen it before. Creed II is a combo of Rocky III and Rocky IV. Just about every single scene is taken from the two Rocky movies. Creed wants to fight Drago, but Rocky does not think that he can win because Drago is hungry - Rocky wants to fight Clubber Lang, but Mickey thinks he cannot win because Clubber is hungry. Creed loses to Drago and then hesitates to fight again and has confidence problems - Rocky loses to Lang and has confidence problems. Rocky gives Creed the speak that gets him to admit his fears - Adrianne gives Rocky the talk to get him to speak his fears. Creed changes his boxing style to fight Drago - Rocky changes his boxing style to fight Lang. Creed goes to a new training facility that is tougher than his previous one - Rocky goes to a new training facility.
While it was a fun movie to watch - there was nothing original. It was Rocky III with some sprinkling of Rocky IV all over with a new boxer.",7,16,28,25 November 2018
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Some Injustice
","Batman v Superman is a very average movie. DC has been lagging far behind Marvel in the presentation of it's superheroes. Batman (Christian Bale) was the only modern DC movie that was good, the rest have been average to below average and BVS is the same.Ben Affleck is alright as Batman. He is not good enough to propel the movie to it's potential, but he is not bad enough to destroy the project. He is just there.Henry Cavill is at least decent as Superman. He will never make anyone forget Christopher Reeves, but he is better than any Superman actor since Reeves.The movie is long and it is boring. There is so many extra scenes just to get a HUGE cast time on film. They have to fit in Amy Adams (who is as average as Affleck in the film), Diane Lane, flashback scenes for Wayne's parents (we all know the story - it does not have to be seen in every film that has Batman), visions of Kevin Costner, and time for Laurence Fishburne. We then also have to make time for Gal Gadot and the Wonder Woman character and show previews (in the film) of Aquaman (GAG), The Flash and Cyborg as promotional material for Justice League.The script, the direction and the timing are tedious. It felt like a long movie. But the biggest flaw was Jesse Eisenberg as Lex Luther. He was beyond bad - he was an injustice to the character and it was so evident he was not the right choice for the role. Every scene he is in brings the film down.The movie would have gotten an 8 for the effects and the action, but I am giving it a 7 overall because of the acting and the script. Eisenberg could have made me rethink the grade and made it a 5/6 because he is that bad.",7,4,7,26 March 2016
Thor: The Dark World," Better than the first
","Thor is a decent movie that really entertains with eye-popping visuals. The story is limited, but it works for a comic book adaptation. The direction is well done and works with the limited skills available.Tom Hiddleston is the reason to watch this movie. Tom is great as Loki and brings a lot of depth and life to the character. Tom looks like he is having fun with the role and provides the spirit that this movie needs to be successful.Chris Hemsworth is there for the women to look at and that is all. I do not believe that he is a great choice for Thor, but this is who Thor is now in movie land. He grunts, he growls, he acts like a WWF wrestler and has no personality at all. The Hulk has more personality than Hemsworth's version of Thor and he is the reason that this movie does not rise to a 9 or 10. If it were not for Hiddleston; Hemsworth would pull this down to a 6 rating. 'Me Thor' 'Me Smash' is the kind of stuff that basically comes out of his mouth and he is not very likable.As I mentioned above Hemsworth is not a positive for this movie--except for those looking at his looks instead of his huge inability to act---Asgardian inability. The supporting cast carries this movie: Anthony Hopkins is wonderful as Odin and brings class to this film; Rene Russo does a nice job; Kat Dennings brings some much needed humor and heart to the movie; and Stellan Skarsgård makes Erik Selvig such a likable character in the Marvel universe. This is why his character has been in three movies and been successful.Skarsgard and Hiddleston are the true stars of this movie and they steal every scene that they are in.",8,1,5,17 November 2013
Midway," Not A Remake of Midway
","Before folks start comparing this film to the very good Charlton Heston version - note that this is not a remake of that movie. While it portrays some of the events, this film focuses mostly on one fighter pilot where the 70's film focused on the planning and the senior officers.Visually the film is outstanding. It looks great and has fantastic air and sea scenes.Story-wise the film is a bit of a mess. The dialog is not the greatest, but it does not kill the film. The screenplay keeps the film a star or two above the pitiful Pearl Harbor, but it is too weak to propel this film into the Saving Private Ryan arena.Emmerick was not the right choice for director. He is mostly a visual director who does not have the storytelling talent needed to tell this historically important event properly. Nor is he known to pull the talent out of an actor to receive the strong performances that these historical figures needed. An example of that is the lead - it is a very weak performance that takes away from the film at times. Mandy Moore is also a non-essential role and her input was not inspiring in any way. Dennis Quaid and Patrick Wilson are the sole reasons to watch the film and they keep it interesting.",6,0,4,9 November 2019
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," It's Star Wars
","It is Star Wars - what did you expect? A lot of folks are bashing this film, but it is a pretty good movie. Again, it is Star Wars: it is the bad, almost non-existent plot; the horrible acting that feels wooden; the ridiculous dialog; and the over-the-top special effects. Star Wars was always a mindless, action adventure with a ridiculous storyline and terrible actors (except for Harrison Ford).The Force Awakens is the same thing: just by chance a droid lands on a planet with important information and runs into a member of the Skywalker family; who than just happens to run into Han Solo; who just happens to be the sire of another bad Skywalker; who just happen to fight another death star. The story is bad - the script is bad - the question is: does the eye candy and action make it at least watchable? The answer is - yes. This is on par with the original and 'The Empire Strike Back'.Daisy Ridley is as bad of an actress as Mark Hamill is as an actor. They kept that same parallel of terrible actors playing the main Skywalker.Folks are complaining about John Boyega, but aside from Han Solo and Chewbacca, I felt that he was one of the better characters in the movie. Oscar Isaac was the other new character that was entertaining to watch.I didn't like Adam Driver as the villain. If the villain is supposed to be Solo and Leia's child; I would have expected a more charismatic actor who looked more like he could have been their child rather than someone who looked like Adrien Brody. He lacks the charisma and looks laughable rather than dangerous.The idea that someone can grab a lightsaber for the first time and beat a trained sith is typical Abrams garbage.There are a lot of bad things in Star Wars - most as a homage to the bad things in the original three - but it is a fun adventure worth seeing. At least George Lucas wasn't involved to make something worse than Phantom Menace, Attack of the Clones and Return of the Sith - three of the worse movies in the history of film-making.",6,5,32,31 December 2015
Life," Cliché after Cliché
","Life is a movie filled with clichés and obvious scenes taken straight from Alien.We have the usual science fiction cliché where scientists are going to bring an alien life form (that probably will kill all of mankind) into play no matter the cost. Of course, one of them will say that studying this alien may lead to the discovery of life and maybe even the cure for disease.We have the usual cliché were one of the scientists will do anything to protect the alien even though it is killing his friends and may destroy all life - with the typical 'if is just trying to survive' line.In Alien: Dallas and Lambert are bringing back Kane after he is attacked by an alien. Ash lets them on the ship even though Ripley warns about contamination. In this movie, Hugh is attacked by the alien and Rory ignores all the warnings and enters the lab creating the chain of events to allow the alien to attack. Now, doesn't anyone wonder how the person in charge of security just allows this breach of protocol? Another science fiction cliché.In Alien: Ash protects the creature by letting it live inside of Kane and does not tell anyone. In Life, Hugh lets the alien feed off of his body so that it can survive and does not tell anyone. Again with the idiotic scientist who wants to keep the alien alive to study it.In Alien: somehow (the most ridiculous scene in a great movie) the alien knows Ripley is going to go onto the escape craft and is inside. In this one the alien is lured into the escape craft, but same premise.In Alien: somehow the idiotic company makes an escape craft that will only fit three people - that was another dumb aspect of a great movie. In Life: there are two escape crafts, but only one person per craft. No space program is going to have an escape plan where only 2/6 can survive and the rest are left for dead. Another cliché.In The Thing: an alien is frozen and in hibernation. The scientists go to study it and it thaws out and kills everyone. In life: the cell is frozen and in hibernation. The scientists thaw it out to study it and it kills people. Another cliché.In Life: somehow the alien knows to knock out communications. Now I do not care how smart something is - it was a single celled organism at the beginning of the movie and no matter how intelligent it is - it does not have a grasp of technology in any way, shape or form. That this creature figures out how to get to the communication array from the lab is a joke - that it knows to knock out communications is a joke - that it knows to destroy the coolant in the commander's space suit to create a situation to get back onto the ship - that it takes over the escape pod and flies it to Earth - these are the things that are insulting at times to viewers. Another cliché about super smart aliens who know everything.So the question you have at the end is: why did this creature just go on a killing spree? Hugh says that it has to kill to survive - but why? It was not eating them to survive - it was just killing for the sake of destruction and chaos. Even in Alien - it had a reason - it was taking people to reproduce. In the Thing - it was on a mission to take over the planet. There is no reason in this film.On a positive - the film looked good and it was good for a late night rental if you enjoy the genre. It is nothing original and the script (and acting) will not redefine anything about science fiction. It is not a classic type movie that you will look back on in time and it will not be influential for future movies.",6,12,28,26 March 2017
Footloose," She can dance, but she cannot act
","In 1984 Kevin Bacon starred in Footloose. It was not a great movie, but it was a fun movie that started a nice career. Now there is the remake. Remakes have a bad habit of tearing a treasured movie down and making a terrible movie in it's place. This is so true of this version of Footloose. It starts with all the bad remakes of 80's songs--why not just use the original artists rather than a terrible singer trying to sing. Like we need some bad singer remake Bonnie Tyler or Kenny Loggins. Next Julianne Hough may be able to dance and sing, but she was the absolute wrong choice for the lead actress. She is not an actress and her money may get her some roles, but she is one of those bad actresses that became popular in another genre that quickly disappears. My biggest disappointment is Dennis Quaid. What is happening with him? I was a big Quaid fan, but he is now making bad movies. He needs to reevaluate his decisions and either take roles for a man his age that have substance or retire from film.",3,12,16,25 March 2012
50_50," 50/50 Rating
","This film is a decent film, but I feel it is 50/50 whether you will like it or not. The film really doesn't get good until the last 15 minutes. The beginning of the film is a bore and the Seth Rogan F-bomb fest is too over the top. The scenes where the anesthesia personal take him from his mother and they put him on the OR table while not in the proper OR gear is ridiculous. As a cancer surviver I related to the Adam character. I had a girlfriend who told me that my cancer 'was intruding on her social life' -- so I asked her to leave. So I know how it feels to have someone bail out on you. My mother (who was aloof most of my life) became overbearing during the whole process as did the character in the film. I related to the film, but because of the sexual nature of 'getting laid before I did' and the f-bomb line after line did not make me feel as much for the character as I should have. The last scene was the final straw also. The total violation of the patient-caregiver role was the last Hollywood part that ruined the ending for me. It is not a bad film if you like more of a Hollywood feel than a real life feel. You also have to get by the f-bomb routine.",6,0,1,29 January 2012
Valkyrie," Nicely Done
","Valkyrie is a very good movie. The acting is beyond what the audience usually gets in today's movies, the direction is well done, and the script is well written. Tom Cruise is surprisingly very good in the movie. He is very convincing and actually has a strong screen presence. Valkyrie is a movie that he was made to be in. Kenneth Branagh also has a strong presence, but he is used very sparingly. Bill Nighy is as good as he usually is in every role he takes. Terence Stamp is marvelous. Tom Wilkinson is extremely good. The entire movie is well done and worth watching. It is an interesting story about true events that is well told.",8,6,12,26 December 2008
The Martian," Space Odyssey Saved
","I am going to start out by saying that I was going to avoid this picture until it hit Netflix. Why? Many reasons: let me start with Ridley Scott - one of the worse directors in cinema - ever. Scott has been involved in very few good films - with Alien and Blade Runner being his only two really good movies. Scott has made some of the worse movies to ever hit film: Exodus, Legend (one of the worse movies ever), Prometheus (a joke of a film), Robin Hood (beyond ridiculous), Body of Lies, Matchstick Men, Hannibal, White Squall, 1402 and the ever dreadful Thelma and Louise. With Scott's track record I was very reluctant to spend money on a film with his name on it.Reason two: Matt Damon. Besides the Bourne series, Damon has made a lot (a huge amount) of bad movies on par with I Bought A Zoo, The Brothers Grimm, Monuments Men, Elysium, etc.Reason three: Jessica Chastain - in her entire body of work, only The Help was a good film and she was a supporting player.Reason four: Kristen Wiig - the queen of foul mouthed, bad comedy. Every movie she has made is for low brow, ignorant people.I went to this movie because I like Sean Bean. I like his screen presence and (with a good script) he has great performances. I also like Chiwentel Ejiofer. Just to see the performances by these two actors was the reason that I went to see this film.Now folks have been comparing this movie to Interstellar and Gravity. It is not close. Interstellar was a garbage movie with major scientific flaws, big gaps in logic (which can kill a space film) and a terrible story. Gravity was one of the worse hyped-up pieces of garbage ever made - an astronaut who just breathes heavy, cannot function, knows nothing about survival, and in the end falls hundreds of miles to Earth and survives - garbage.The Martian goes back to what you would believe in a space odyssey: the main character is afraid of dying, but he allows his intelligence and training to help him to survive; there are people who are intelligent and thought provoking at NASA (which a lot of movies make them out to be idiots and heartless); there is a lot of good characterization in the film which give heart to the characters and it makes you care about what happens to them; there is a lack of the dumb - very dumb - acts of God/space/climate that always happen where members of the rescue team will die or that will jeopardize the mission (Mission to Mars, Red Planet, for example); the rescue attempt is presented in a reasonable manner and logical manner utilizing good science; there are a few F-bombs thrown out there, but it is saturated like most of today's movies (because of ignorant screen-writers who do not know what to write); the movie does not do the Game of Thrones routine with mindless sex and nudity every ten minutes (most movies today have to stop the action/story for sex and nudity to appease the clichés present in movie making today); the landscapes, the modules, the ships, etc all look great and they look functional and real.This is the type of movie I had expected from Scott after Alien and Blade Runner. This is the type of acting I expected from Damon after Good Will Hunting, Saving Private Ryan and the Bourne series. This is what I was hoping Chastain would do after her breakout in The Help.Overall I give it a 9/10. It is one of the finest space/science fiction films that I have ever seen - on par with The Right Stuff, 2010, Moon and Apollo 13.",9,3,60,3 October 2015
The Fighter," Not a Rocky, Million Dollar Baby or a Cinderella Man--just foul mouthed
","There have been so many good boxing movies over the years: Raging Bull and Rocky set the bar extremely high for boxing movies; On the Waterfront showed a great portrayal of a failed boxer dealing with life; Million Dollar Baby was a spectacular look at the relationship between boxer and trainer; Cinderella Man was a perfect example of the comeback; Somebody Up There Likes Me was a nice movie; The Boxer (Daniel Day Lewis) was a great film about overcoming the odds; Hard Times (Charles Bronson) was a terrific film about bare fisted boxing.The Fighter was not comparable to the aforementioned movies in many ways: there was no character development whatsoever -- so you do not feel the joy of a Rocky winning or the pain of Maggie Fitzgerald breaking her neck -- you feel nothing at the end. The script was laced with profanity -- way too much profanity -- you feel like you are the one being punched in the face with all the foul language. I do not think there is a single line that does not have the F-bomb (or an equivalent vileness) spouted from any of the characters. The movie plays like a foul-mouthed Jerry Springer episode and looks like it was made for today's vile, uneducated, ignorant generation.I admire that the 'real' Mickey fought against the odds and won a title and I admire that the 'real' Dicky cleaned his life up and went on to help his brother in his time of need. I do not think the movie's portrayal of the characters did much to emphasize what could have been a good movie about comebacks and life changes.Not Rocky--not Raging Bull--nowhere near Million Dollar Baby or Cinderella Man--wait for it on video.",6,20,38,31 December 2010
