Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," A major letdown.
","Despite the CGI eye-candy, and notwithstanding the claim that 'plot does matter' by the film's producers, this sequel was nothing shot of a grand disappointment.The previous three films in this series profiled mythic battles and memorable characters, wry and witty humor, sensible plots and classic dialogue. TPM, on the other hand is sloppy, with little character development or interaction, lowest-common denominator humor, a terrible performance by its youngest cast member, forgettable and repetitive dialogue, a disjointed storyline, and slow, plodding pacing.Due to the sheer brilliance of its predecessors, TPM will probably break all kinds of box office records.  But this film will not stand up to the test of time.We can only hope that Episode II will be better.",2,0,1,24 May 1999
The Best Years of Our Lives," This film is great...
","I can't believe this movie came out only one year after WWII had ended.We've seen the 'war hero comes home' story a million times since, but this early incarnation is especially great, with a very modern narrative style, a terrific script with great characters and dialogue, and some truly wonderful small moments.Why I'd never heard of this film before the AFI 'best 100 films' list I don't know.  See it.",Null,1,2,13 October 1998
