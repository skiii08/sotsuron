Conquest 1453," THIS CITY deserves its story to be told
","'Fetih 1453' is the best (historical) action - drama film I have ever seen and this is my true and objective impression about the film. This film of an important moment in the history of the Western/Muslim world is a great watch. It manages to build tension and excitement despite the fact that the audience knows the outcome. As well, if you like history or screen battle/war scenes this film is also for you. The film tells the story of 'fall of Constantinople' and this gives you the best screenplay through its nature as an era changing case which affected the world, religions and cultures. On the other hand you may feel how hard the conquest is and as a conqueror how hard it is to stand still, being strong and decided to go on. I think Devrim (Mehmet II) is really makes you feel all the hardship as you were him and even when you are watching the film you go through desperate and hopeful times and you can be sure that you won't see arrogance and insolence in the film as some Greek reviewer said through their hatred. I highly recommend it to cinema lovers.Also I will highlight a sentence that is written about the conquest: There is no doubt that this defeat after 1000 years of successful defense was a tragic time but this fading star of the Christian world rises to become the center of the Muslim world, maintaining its glory for centuries more. THIS CITY deserves its story to be told.",10,14,47,29 February 2012
