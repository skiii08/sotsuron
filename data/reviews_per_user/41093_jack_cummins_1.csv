Sucker Punch," Zack Synder's Inception
","This is stunning to look at and will give intriguing thought for a good while. Ignore anyone who says this film is dumb because they are the unintelligent ones in the situation.The film has multiple layers and examples of depth. Each women in the group represents something as well as key objects, the setting and the characters surrounding them. The multiples layers are: 1. The Dark Reality, 2. The Brothel (imaginary), 3. The Battle (fighting inner-demons).The film is very underrated and misunderstood. This is Warner Bros. fault as their marketing team showed the film to be a action blockbuster but it's more of a psychological film with action scenes.Rating: 10/10. A strong recommendation",10,8,11,19 April 2019
