Kill Bill: Vol. 2," 2nd Part of this film
","This story began interesting, becoming a journey without return. The ending, completely waited, not at all unusual. As he began he did not wind up his ending it was boring, silly and we all were expecting already the bill's famous death.I really don't know what they see this  film. To no one of both.Too much fantasyWho was she? The wonder  woman or steel woman ? That nobody was able to do something, like a Wound or something.",1,1,5,4 May 2004
