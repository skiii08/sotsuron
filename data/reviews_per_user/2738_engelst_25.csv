Walk the Line," Boring display of cardboard characters
","I expected a lot from Walk The Line, and although after seeing the movie I wasn't thoroughly displeased, it left a sort empty feeling. Walk The Line was much too long and it just didn't deliver the drama the story deserved. You could distill drama from what happened (like Cash's overdose or his performance in a prison), but it stayed there on the screen and didn't come across to the viewer.Witherspoon and Phoenix were not altogether in their element. Witherspoon is far more convincing and quite believable, although not always in tune with the events. Phoenix is over the top, overacting his way into one of the lesser performances of his career. Although there was some chemistry, it was not nearly enough to make us believe in the passionate Carter/Cash love story.The biggest flaw of this movie I found to be the directing. The movie lacks pace, guts and, sadly, an interest in the lives of the characters it displays. This becomes all too evident in the treatment of the 'prop' characters: Cash's first wife, his band members, even a few popular singers of the time like Elvis or Jerry Lee Lewis. They are cardboard characters. Ultimately this is true for the two main characters as well, who are saved only by their screen time.I'll have to wait till a biopic of the real Cash is made. Until then, I'll probably grab a written one.",6,2,5,27 May 2006
The Equalizer," Denzalizer
","Like so many big budget action flicks lately, The Equalizer just can't deliver.The only thing keeping this movie above cheap action flicks is Denzel Washington. His suave confident self, Denzel moves through the hordes much like his also aging colleague Liam Neeson, crunching bones and slicing throats with satisfying style and skill. It could make a TV cook jealous.The story, though stuffed with the obligatory clichés that we expect from a self-respecting action flick, lacks a believable plot. What really stood out, IMHO, was a number of atmosphere spoilers. One that comes to mind is building up a pretty decent bad guy and then letting him leave almost unnoticed through the back door.The main flaw, and a very regrettable one, is that the movie fails to develop Washington's full potential. The guy is pictured as a true killing machine, but just when we're nailed to our chairs, the whole thing falls flat. The book scene being extremely impressive, many of the other scenes missing out either through the lack of direction or by a lack of scripting.There are many cheaper Jason Statham movies that deliver more satisfactory action. Looking at those and at the first Taken movie, the answer must be simplicity. The Equalizer has too much excess luggage and ends up losing the fight.",6,5,7,5 March 2015
Monster," Average in every way
","Monster aspires to do what Boys Don't Cry has achieved: a human portrayal of a freak. But Monster falls short because it takes itself too seriously and because it is too sentimental. The director stumbles over her own feet trying to make us sympathize with the monster, something that would have been much easier if she wouldn't be breathing down our necks: 'Look, pathos!' 'To your left, human kindness!' 'Hey, more good deeds just around that corner!'. Especially the ending suffers from it, because the director raises the emphasis to bring across a sense of urgency and tension. It left me with dry eyes and an empty heart. Charlize Theron certainly did a good effort with her role. But her performance was very uneven at best, wavering between warm femininity and an unconvincing macho attitude. One is left wondering whether she is portraying a gauche character or whether she is having trouble portraying a woman with a male attitude. Certainly it was not an Oscar-worthy performance. If you compare this role to the one portrayed by Hillary Swank, the latter stands out with ease.",6,3,7,10 March 2004
Hostel," Trash of the worst kind
","I saw this as a sneak preview. I don't go much for slashers, so I wouldn't have bothered otherwise.The basic premise of the movie (sale of tourists to be tortured by rich people looking for the ultimate kick) I can't criticize, although, as I said, wouldn't draw me to the cinema.The story is set in present day Slowakia and sadly, here the director makes himself guilty of a shameless lack of knowledge of, consideration or any form or respect for Slowakian people. This is not because the movie is set in Slowakia. It's because he wants us to believe the crude facts presented are common in that country and everybody living there is somehow or other involved in the unspeakable.In a way this crude and ignorant superficiality is laughable, in another it's not. Especially knowing that Slowakia is a country filled with normal and mostly very kind people rather on the poorish side who can use the extra income from tourists.",2,1,2,28 July 2006
The Others," What The Sixth Sense Could Have Been
","I enjoyed this film and although being a film buff experienced to the point of callousness (I watched the Exorcist a few weeks ago and was mildly amused), it touched a vein. I noticed at one point I was bent forward on the couch..The film has few if any flaws and is certainly one of the best I've seen this year. It's a delight to watch, with its attention to detail and the absence of any blatant anachronisms or plot holes.When I watched The Sixth Sense, I was disappointed. A spectacular plot twist was packaged in a very average film with average performances. The Others is so much more. It explores the human questions raised in a far better way and succeeds in creating a believable, living environment for the plot.It's predecessor remains a pale shadow, almost obliterated.",7,0,2,15 November 2005
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Next time, use the force, George
","Star Wars II: Attack of the Clones missed the Oscars, but maybe more importantly, the Raspberry awards. Although it is improbable that the hype and its immense popularity would endanger a solid performance at the Oscars.The good part of this film lies in the truly amazing special effects and the excellent use of all kinds of sf goodies, like sailing spaceships etc. This makes the film stand out from any of the recent productions.However, watching the film as what it is, a story in its own right, you cannot help but notice how deeply flawed the script is. This isn't helped in any way by Lucas' sloppy direction. Important scenes are unceremoniously expedited without the necessary buildup and leave you feeling robbed. For example, the courtly atmosphere and the pomp of the Senate are contradicted by Amidala's entry: instead of being given the appropriate honors of a senator (and, more importantly, of a key character in the film), everyone starts talking to her at once. Invariably, a character will advance in a grand manner, and have nothing noteworthy to say. This makes it hard to believe a story that is told on such an epic scale. The romance between Amidala and Anakin is just as hard to believe. There are no sparks coming across. The fact that neither of them make us believe in their respective characters doesn't help. Natalie Portman has a squeaky voice, reminding you of a spoiled teenager rather than an important senator cum adventuress. She is miscast for the role. Christensen is solid as an insecure but intelligent Jedi, but his internal motives are too vague and his agony doesn't come across convincingly.From the freshness and inspiration of the subject matter in the first two Star Wars films, little or nothing is left. Lucas has built up an aura which is consolidated by his special effects gurus. But for them, the emperor would be naked for real and probably for good.",5,0,0,22 May 2002
Nightcrawler," Artificial
","As a Gyllenhaal fan I'm disappointed. In Nightcrawler, Gyllenhaal is out of his depth as a guiltless night creature. He's trying hard but somehow ends up looking just that - somebody trying hard to pretend.As for the movie, it suffers from the same problem. The story is weak and lacks natural story line and characters. An example is when Louis has a job interview with a young guy and exposes him as a male prostitute. This whole scene is so wrong. The whole relationship between Louis and Rick may look good on paper but it doesn't work in the movie, even with two actors that can pull it off.Although the character of Louis is certainly not a boring one, because it's so artificial it becomes tedious to watch. Add to that the many incongruities, I found myself wanting the movie to be over long before the end.",5,1,2,1 August 2015
Little Miss Sunshine," What would happen?
","What would happen if you did the opposite of all the things that go wrong in Hollywood mainstream movies and made a movie out of *that*? You might end up with a movie like Little Miss Sunshine.Nothing in Little Miss Sunshine wants to be mainstream, except of course the 18 karat cast who beam their way through the movie knowing they are enhancing their CVs while building some excellent karma on the side.The problem is, if you don't have a story worth telling, none of this matters. The good acting, all the weird and 'different' characters.. it all falls to dust because the story is actually lacking the essential spice to get the viewer to the end with a feeling it was worth the sit.It happens so often with American indie type movies. The makers are so happy to be off the beaten track that plain cinematographic laws are forgotten. And the audience don't punish them for it.Confronting Hollywood with its many flaws takes more than just good intentions.",6,1,4,16 March 2009
Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters," Fun to watch, but a huge waste of potential
","Hansel And Gretel has great potential but suffers from bland and clumsy direction. If the director had been top quality, this could have been a surprise hit and one of the top action movies of the year. Hansel and Gretel is full of fresh ideas and irreverently injects the old tale we all know with blood, comedy and sex. Now we're left with a half-baked fusion of genres that doesn't quite cut it.Sometimes the timing is so bad that the movie almost stops in its tracks. Due to poor shot selection many of the good action scenes are less cool and thrilling.E.g., the cool weapons do not get the screen time and exposure they deserve. Scenes introducing some of the weapons seem to have been cut. So, surprisingly, you may not see enough of the weapon to totally appreciate what it can do. This may seem trivial, but I'd say the weapons account for about one third of the charm of the movie.The same goes for the characters, which are often thrown into a scene that doesn't properly connect to the previous one.The main roles are well cast, which makes up for some of the aforementioned waste of potential. I found Gemma Arterton to be fresh, sexy and fun to watch. Renner is not as good (for which we may also blame the director), but he handles the combination of language, comedy and action well. The entire cast is A movie material and is doing a more than decent job.If you don't mind a new take on fantasy and fairy tale, you'll have fun.",6,0,2,18 August 2013
The Butterfly Effect," Simplistic and vulgar
","The central plot around which the movie pivots is the inescapable destiny of a couple of children whose lives are turned around by a cruel accident, incest and paedophilia.The movie tries to save itself with unexpected turns à la The Sixth Sense (without ever attaining its level), roller-coaster direction and mysterious (yawn) supernatural powers.Broadly speaking, the movie is shallow and repetitive and even worse, the initial plot with its pitfalls and controversy is never in itself questioned or developed with the care it deserves. The movie leaves a bad taste in the mouth, especially because it has no cinematic originality or even merit by itself.Steer clear of this tasteless rehash of many examples using supernatural phenomenons such as Sixth Sense, Unbreakable and Phenomenon, to name just a few.",4,0,3,25 April 2011
Mamma Mia!," Gloriously and involuntarily funny
","Mamma Mia is good fun. Honestly. Too bad that fun is smeared over much too long a distance, and is interspersed with some of the most horrible acting, singing and directing I've seen in years.The story, unimaginative though it was, did have some potential but was ruined by a bad cast. To name a few: Sky, the bridegroom who moves like a monkey and has a matching voice. Pierce Brosnan, who acts well enough but boy oh boy .. how did he get trapped on the set of a musical? And they let him SING?! It's actually so strange it's funny. Another role that made my blood curdle was Meryl Streep's. Yes, she has a decent voice and does a commendable job of most of the songs. But some of it, especially The Winner Takes It All, was so over the top, so badly badly acted, just mindblowing.The direction did the rest to finish off the bland story and make sure it will end in the DVD grab bag at the supermarket. Unfortunately, a lot of potential was wasted here. Most of the scenes are shot in the most boring fashion. A lot of the dancing shots are badly cut and are screaming for some choreography that deserves the name.Fans of good musicals, steer clear. Fans of the actors in it, beware. You may see something that will change the way you saw your idol forever.",4,2,6,25 December 2008
Gone Girl," Sub Fincher level routine flick
","What a waste of talent. Here we have a nice idea for a thriller, a few of Hollywood's finest actors and directors, and then we get this scraped together little mongrel of a film.The movie starts off OK, but as the mystery unravels, more and more atmosphere killers crop up, spoiling the excellent premise.Because this is a story about a meticulously planned crime, the scenario and direction have to be just as meticulous. Well, the production has not managed to keep the heads turned the same way. So instead of enjoying the masterful scheming of a sick brain, we're cringing at mistake after mistake.Too bad, I really wanted to like this movie.",6,1,5,22 March 2015
Hero," Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon... but better
","This movie is one of the best Kung Fu movies I have ever seen - maybe the best - and one of the best movies I have seen in the last couple of months. The story, the imagery and the quality of the acting are difficult to match. All these elements blend into a breathtaking and totally unique experience. I was so tense with excitement I sat upright in my chair during most of the movie. Also, the movie offers a lot of oriental wisdom without making it sound cheap. The final conclusion of the movie resounds after you leave the theater and makes an impact comparable to the movie itself. Personally I found this a very rewarding movie.In retrospect Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon looks a bit shallow and unspectacular, both visually and in terms of storytelling.",9,0,0,10 March 2004
Moulin Rouge!," New Opera for the New Century
","Moulin Rouge! starts with a tell-tale scene of a conductor working himself in a sweat conducting an imaginary orchestra before large curtains.Expecting a pseudo-historical romantic view of turn-of-the-century Paris, I got thrown into a turbulent vaudeville. Instead of a voyeuristic approach the director had the guts to actually throw me smack in the middle of the actual stage without so much as a warning.At first I plucked my eyebrows but it was simply irresistible. Moulin Rouge! is loud, outrageous... and deeply moving.The heart of the movie is a classic opera-style tale filled with romance, deceit, treachery and death. The form however is far removed from anything I have ever seen. The musical accompaniment is a skillful medley right across twentieth century music. What to think of a room filled with men in cylinder hats dancing to 'Smells Like Teen Spirit' by Nirvana?. If Verdi lived in our time, would this have been his approach? Who knows, and who cares. I could never get enough of this exuberant, rich and yet somehow sober performance.The acting is excellent, with outstanding roles by Nicole Kidman and Jim Broadbent. The director is both ubiquitous and subtly withdrawn. Ubiquitous in the loving care that went into every detail. Withdrawn in the strict adherence to the self-set rules of the story and the way it is told. Not once do you tell yourself: 'Hey wait a minute, this is a movie! I am sitting in a theatre, and this isn't real!'The story is told in one long trait. At the intermission I actually felt like having had desert, and still had half the movie to go.To finish off the compliments, the movie, besides being a real tearjerker, is simply great fun. You can't miss the scenes where the rotund theatre director sings 'Like a Virgin'. And it works!Don't miss Moulin Rouge!",10,0,1,21 September 2001
Million Dollar Baby," A Million Dollars Worth Of Disappointment
","Eastwood is revealed yet again as a mediocre director, who is not capable of making a decent film from a script that clearly needed some viagra injected into it.Looking back at my viewing experience, I mainly feel disgust. Disgust at having someone pressing my tear glands so unceremoniously.What Million Dollar Baby fails most miserably at is creating a believable interaction between it's main characters. As all the actors for the main parts have shown they're capable of better, we must blame the director. Especially sad is Eastwood's own performance. Usually very dependable, Eastwood is so weak in this film, it's almost irritating to watch him. Swank and Freeman manage to make the most of their weak roles but to call their appearances 'noteworthy' would be an exaggeration.Of course the real baddie in this drama is the story itself, which is chuck-full of crudely-drawn clichés, caricatures and plain stupidity. Even a B-movie deserves better than this drivel.Eastwood is badly in need of material for a rehabilitation after this latest performance.By the way, putting this movie on a par with Raging Bull is both ridiculous and an insult to Martin Scorcese. Even Clint himself would be appalled.",4,1,5,15 November 2005
Taken," Liam Neeson saves ridiculous script
","Liam Neeson, father of a slightly rebellious teen, finds himself confronted by a parent's worst nightmare: his daughter has been abducted. Paris serves as the background for first rate action, spiced with one of the worst scripts I've come across in years. Apparently Europe is a den of iniquity where police, the rich and famous and seedy Albanians all connive to abduct innocent American girls not heeding parental advice.The film lacks local colour, which is all but absent. Paris is depicted as if it were the capital of Dagestan, where nothing is as it should be and crime and treason lurk behind every corner.Liam Neeson is his usual concentrated solid self and makes the film worth while, delivering a believable ex secret agent. Anything else is silly and forgettable. Liam beats up everything that crosses his path, interspersed with a satisfying neck crunch here and there.Fans of Neeson or B-level action-only flicks will be rewarded, anyone else abstain.",8,2,3,16 April 2012
From Hell," Violent yet boring
","Nobody seems to have asked what this film was about during the making, so you have to ask yourself this question after viewing it. It is violent, yet does not succeed in grasping your attention. It is stylish without being inspiring. It talks without telling a story. If this were a yarn told in a pub it wouldn't make it past the first couple of scenes.",4,1,2,20 March 2002
A Beautiful Mind," Interesting biography turned into a chaotic display of cinematic mediocrity
","This film provides inspiring flashes of the life of John Nash, winner of the 1994 economics Nobel Prize.Unfortunately, it does so in a rather daunting way. The film lacks momentum and at times someone seems to have decided to simply kick the script in the butt to at least keep the film moving. As a spectator it is hard to know what was actually intended: a thriller, a biography, a feel-good movie or simply an attempt to make some profit in the wake of the 'Sixth Sense'.Russell Crowe was over-acting grossly. Many a time a wry smile forces itself unto you seeing him clown his way through the darker parts of this drama. As usual, Jennifer Connelly gives a charming but rather bleak appearance. Under the circumstances the acting is more than adequate though, and provides one of the few memorable points of this movie.The scenes depicting life at a university are so simplistic that you don't know if you should laugh at so much stupidity or be angry at the director for treating you like a dimwit. The more so as this is a story about a man with an exceptionally high I.Q..I read somewhere that throughout the film one can see the microphones. I didn't actually notice this (understandably, as the movie does its best to mix romantic intermezzos with a contrived thriller plot). But this doesn't come as a surprise seeing that the most important parts of the movie have been unlovingly expedited.Sadly, the most novel aspect of this story, i.e. the workings of a man's mind, and more specifically the victory of a man over his own mental illness, almost disappeared under the mass of cliche story elements and the artificial (and ultimately superfluous) plot twists à la Sixth Sense.",5,1,3,5 March 2002
Edge of Tomorrow," Falls short of its potential
","I'm a huge Groundhog Day fan. Unsurprisingly, I'm charmed by the basic premise of Edge Of Tomorrow. Sadly, the idea has not been consequently exploited. There are many plot holes and we're missing real tension and intensity.Although I'm not a fan of Tom Cruise, I have to respect how he can always lift a movie with a very reliable performance. I loved Emily Blunt, hovering between military toughness and subtle femininity.If you didn't know the main plot before seeing the movie (a must if you want to enjoy it fully), the movie starts off with a surprise. But after an adrenaline-filled introduction, the story loses pace and starts stumbling from one plot hole to the next. The atmosphere suffers from the lack of different scenery and the overdose of scene repeats (necessary for the story but just not handled with the required finesse). If it weren't for the lead roles, I would put this off as a boring little scifi-flick.Fortunately, the chemistry between Blunt and Cruise is excellent, which helps keep us on our toes and motivated to follow the story.",6,1,4,22 March 2015
Downfall," Distanced and sober view of Hitler's last days
","The first 15 minutes made me doubt the qualities of this movie. The situations were a bit forced and the cuts were strange. But after the uncomfortable beginning the movie took momentum and kept it until the end.I think the choice of depicting Hitler as a human being with a dispassionate and modest direction was excellent. The film never tries to force viewers into an opinion. Everybody can form his own opinion. Too often the horrors of WWII led writers and directors to depict Nazis as monsters. Perfectly normal human beings can be cruel and merciless if they are blinded (by hate for example), which should never be forgotten.In a way, a human Hitler to me is more guilty than a raving monster. He had the choice and he chose to do wrong. He could choose life and he chose murder and destruction. A human being lost respect for the life of other human beings and led a country into genocide. Ultimately he loses respect for all life and starts sacrificing his own soldiers at random. This is what I value this film for, making the idea of a human Hitler tangible.It was very brave to make this film, given that controversy was almost certain to arise. One of the highlights of this year, to be sure.",7,442,599,12 November 2004
The Sixth Sense," Much ado about nothing
","If you leave out the crucial scene, all that's left is an oversentimental picture with too much violence. All in all it's empty of real emotion and it lacks a centerpiece that is not just a gimmick.",5,1,2,4 January 2001
Flight," Without Denzel this movie crashes
","An unexpectedly bad movie with Washington, one of my favorite American actors.I found Flight bleak and boring. After an initial climax the movie plods on and takes too much time to say too little. The cardboard characters deserve little sympathy and do not help to draw you in. The fact that the main character has questionable morals, to say the least, makes it extra hard. Washington does a commendable job, but the tame direction and the cheesy script make it awkward to watch somebody you just don't want to like or feel sorry for. The portrait is not strong enough for that.Washington's sidekick will have trouble to build a portfolio based on her performance. She is no match for Washington and her role is even harder to swallow.Only die-hard Washington fans (there must be many) should invest in this movie. All others, wait for it to show on TV.",4,1,3,21 July 2013
Spectre," Runs out of ideas halfway
","Spectre starts in a typical James Bond fashion, with an action scene in grand style. Best opening I've seen in a while!The first part mostly keeps a good pace and we're treated to a host of gorgeous locations as well as some classy Bond women. If we compare to Die Another Day, one of the really bad Bonds that come to mind, we're at the opposite side of the scale. Spectre does a lot of effort to be truly and subtly beautiful. Léa Seydoux is certainly a good choice. Here I would compare to the more beautiful but much less enigmatic Kurylenko.Unfortunately, after the first half has passed, the pace slackens and the attention for detail is suddenly dropped. One of the key locations here is an anonymous looking old building. Why we're asked to spend time here instead of any other location that would be less dark, boring and cliché is left in the middle.Daniel Craig was not my Bond of choice, but he has grown on me (us) and he does a more than commendable job. Overall, I have only praise for all the main actors in the movie. It's all appropriate and top notch.The same cannot be said of the scenario. It just won't do to get Bond to a location and then blow it up without any sort of showdown or tension buildup. The obligatory destruction of the bad guy headquarters deserves better than what we saw here.If Mendes had kept up the level of the first half, we could be looking at one of the top 3 Bonds of all time. Now it's just an honorable mention. Such a waste of talent.",6,2,8,8 November 2015
Mad Max: Fury Road," Great fun and somehow brilliant
","I've grown up with Mad Max. The first came out when I was 16. I have seen all the movies numerous times, I've even been to a Mad Max Marathon, to see MM I to III. So, without being a hardcore fan, I like Mad Max a lot. But after Mad Max III I decided (and a lot of fans with me, I'm sure), that it was probably better to leave it there.I went to the cinema expecting a rehash of the old Mad Max, but boy was I in for a surprise. George Miller has outdone himself and created a worthy successor that may even be better than parts II and certainly III.The makers have squeezed every little bit of extra fun there was in the story and managed to put all this fun into a well-balanced movie that never stops, even though it manages to have a few quiet moments. I liked the humor and the timing especially. It is the best action movie I have seen for a long, long time for exactly that reason.The only bit of criticism I have is Tom Hardy or maybe his presence in the movie. Did he have a fight with the director? All I know is, for a main character he doesn't have anywhere near the screen time he should get. Nicholas Hoult (compliments to him) stole a lot of it. Looks suspicious. Now I don't know Tom Hardy all that well, but I think he's capable of a lot more than what we get to see here. Which is basically a lot of muscle and very little facial expression or dialog.All in all though this has to be one of the best post-apocalyptic movies of all time and an example of how to make action fun. It makes Death Proof look old.. very, very old.",8,2,9,24 May 2015
Donnie Darko," Pretty Darko
","Of the mainstream American movies I have seen in the past months, this is surely one of the most surprising.The nice suburban setting made me wary at first, expecting another of the countless exposes on the problems of people who have nothing to worry about except the excess of luxury.But pretty soon I got swept up in the mystery of this boy who is somehow doomed. The story is pretty thick and the music is outright annoying at times. Still, the acting is good. Especially the guy playing Donnie is terrific. I also liked the way the movie evades overt moralism and instead lets you judge for yourself. This is only partly true, but if you compare this film to 90% of other Hollywood teenage films (Life as a house stands out as a particularly ominous example), it certainly is refreshing.",7,0,0,15 May 2002
