Requiem for a Dream," An outrageous drug-mania that will shake your mind, brain and body from top to bottom. A Cinematic Masterpiece !
","Requiem For A Dream (2000) :
Brief Review -An outrageous drug-mania that will shake your mind, brain and body from top to bottom. A Cinematic Masterpiece ! Requiem For A Dream is such an ordinary story as it depicts four characters affected by drug addiction and how it alters their physical and emotional state but have you ever came across the term called 'Director's Cinema'? It simply means, you give any kind of ordinary story to the director and he will turn it into an Extraordinary film. Well, THIS IS Director's Cinema. An ordinary story of drug addicts is turned into a disturbing Cinematic Masterpiece by director's brilliant mind and skills. The film shook me from inside as well as from outside just by the proper use of display and sound. The footage is drawn as such in the film with an outrageous use of background score that the cumulative result lefts you with Goosebumps. Especially in the last 40 minutes this film is like a Film-making course to everyone who wants to learn about quality cinema. Darren Aronofsky gets a salute from me for his Directorial brilliance. He presented this story with realistic gimmicks, brutality, abusive content and filth so that it shows you real damnifications of drugs. He made Ellen Burstyn, Jared Leto, Jennifer Connelly and Marlon Wayans go wild, crazy, nasty and abusive but it all worked and thier performances looked so freaking real. Clint Mansell deserves a special mention for his stunning score because without him this experience wouldn't have been the same. I can assure you, once you watch this film then you will never ever dare to touch or even think about drugs. This is an brutal assassination of drug freaks and a lesson to all those who either suffer from it or thier relatives who just endure them. Watch it to learn Cinematic genius and how to make a solid film from a decent content. I am still shivering while writing this review, that's says all i guess. A MUST SEE !RATING - 9/10*By - #samthebestest",9,0,0,26 May 2020
The Sound of Music," A classic musical and enchanting film for all eras..
","Short Review :-Watched The Sound Of Music (1965)A Classic Musical and enchanting film for all eras. The Sound Of Music has a simple and happy story without much of intense conflicts but then it meets Wonderful cast, great direction and enchanting Music. There are quite few things to notice in the script as i have done for myself, First i love the simplicity of the Basic script which has so many levels and gateways and the musical journey in the film keep unfolding each and every one of them. The first meeting of Maria with Nuns, then her meeting with the childrens, then Maria and Childrens bond, then a love story, then a turnaround seperation for a while, then her return to find her life and finally the escape from Nazis with Musical End. It fits so perfectly in there. Even the character of Baroness is so cleverly written, it doesn't go Villainous way. Rather she has a sense of true love and not to be a fake one when Captain reveals her about being not loyal to her she clearly accepts it and that scene is so sensible. All characters in the film have thier own identification, whether it is wild, nasty Maria or disciplined but kind Captain or each one from those seven childrens. Maybe the characterisation is something that makes this simple story so connectable. The Sound Of Music broke the long standing box office record of Gone With The Wind and currently it is the 3rd most watched film in Hollywood ever, it doesn't matter now if i even try to point out some minuses because some films are made to make audience happy, not to mess up their minds. The Sound Of Music has a legacy that needs to be cherished forever. Thank you Robert Wise for giving this full of joy, full of music and full of colours life lesson.

Airlift," Ordinary film as a movie lover and above Ordinary as an Indian.
","AIRLIFT REVIEW- Want to clear 1 thing at the start only that although i am Akshay Kumar fan my review will be complete neutral. When we all saw the teaser and trailer we all felt like, yes Akki is coming with another Quality movie, patriotic film is coming, award winning film is coming and bla bla bla. In short we were expecting a Classic means our Expectations were high. So even i Watched it with very high expectations and came out of from Theater with at least satisfied face if not Fully satisfied. As we know it is based on true story so no doubts story will be good and all remains to be seen is how makers present it. Movie starts with beautiful locations as Akshay appears in very casual scene. Everything goes casual for 15 minutes 1 songs pasts which looks average and suddenly main story starts. How Iraq attacked Kuwait and killed all local people along with some Indians based there its all the starting of this story. Content was very sensitive but looks very casual on screens and here Film team fails. How all Indians face circumstances and their desperation to escape from everything keeps you immersed in film and Interval appears. Till Interval it looked ordinary film cause we get nothing special to watch till Interval. All weight of expectations comes to 2nd half which is certainly better than 1st half. Then last 10 minutes are full of Goosebumps but only if you are an Indian. And then some available original stills of true heroes of this evacuation story which left us with Patriotic feeling. Still after movie ends i feel like something was missing. Its not that level movie which i was expecting. Something looked spoiled and messed up. Acting- i am happy to talk about 1 of my favorite Actor that he has given excellent performance here. Not saying its award winning though, it was excellent at its particular level. Nimrat Kaur made me her fan now with this movie. Previously saw her in Lunchbox where she acted well but looked ordinary as heroin. But in this movie she improved as an Actor and looked beautiful as heroin too. Certainly she deserves all appreciation as her expression in frightened scenes and in arrogant scenes were fab. Somewhere it looked like she Overtook Akshay. I don't know the name of that guy who played Iraq Officer's role but whoever he is, he has given very very good performance with beautiful Iraqis accent and dialog delivery. So many actors in supporting roles including them and other star cast all were good. Music- music was good but i personally think all songs looked unnecessary in screenplay. All songs were average to good, not a single bad song in album. Songs are good to listen instead of watching in movie. Screenplay- It is the most important part for films like this and it is strictly good as i didn't find anything special or excellent in it. Still i think runtime could been 10 minutes less as movie looked stretched little bit. Cinematography- film shot at beautiful locations and camera scale look lavish. Some scenes in house could have been better as they shot in dim light. Direction- i don't know much about Raja Menon but as per my info he is not that high level quality director so expecting a masterpiece from him is not fair. He did good job but i expected classic direction which didn't happen. With this story Director has to make a Classic film but he failed little bit not fully. Final Words- Overall a good film and another good film in Akki's career. But my expectations were very high so i didn't find it that much good as it should be made. Don't know why but i expected something like Akshay's last year release Baby and if i compare Airlift with Baby then it is 1 Star lesser than Baby. Baby had tight screenplay and classic direction which Airlift had only Good which is not enough. Last year for Baby i said it is First Quality movie of the but i don't think i can say it for now for Airlift. I mean entire movie cannot be judged on its awesome last 10 minutes of climax. So Go and watch it for Akshay Kumar & Nimrat Kaur's fine performances and its Climax which will give you Goosebumps cause it is inspirational tale for us Indians.. 7/10 stars by me :)",7,8,29,22 January 2016
Spartacus," Stanley Kubrick's Magnus Opus on legend Spartacus couldn't battle out the fact that it came just after Legendary Ben-Hur
","Spartacus (1960) :Brief Review -Stanley Kubrick's magnus opus on legend Spartacus couldn't battle out the fact that it came just after Legendary Ben Hur. Maybe Stanely Kubrick is not the man for Magnus Opus and Historical Biopics. Spartacus could have been an epic tale and a legendary motion picture considering the kind of grandeur and topic it had but the fact that Hollywood went too ahead with films like 'The Ten Commandments' and 'Ben Hur' just before Spartacus couldn't let it become so. I am a big fan of Stanley Kubrick and the kind of realistic, brutal films he has made but may be he's not the one who fits in magnum opus genre. This kind of films need different perspective and different cinematic liberty which is lacking here in Spartacus. You see the grandeur in the film but somehow it just doesn't work the way it should work, it doesn't feel big. It just passed by so quickly with lack of cinematic Liberty hence making it look so rough. I remember so many moments from Ben Hur and The Ten Commandments giving me jitters every time i watch them. Every time they look big and thrills me. Here Spartacus lacks it and it also lacks the feel of legend of Spartacus. The man should have been glorified in the film like a Hero, like a legend but he looks so ordinary in the film. The film is about 195 minutes long but more than half of the runtime doesn't focus on Spartacus, it goes on focusing more on Roman politics which was not at all needed in the biopic of Spartacus. There should have been more about Spartacus and then maybe impact would have been more powerful. The film has got positives like Acting, cinematography and technical brilliance but i would have been more happy if all this had been used to glorify the legend in heroic and enormous way. Maybe Ben Hur being too huge and legendary causes me to accept the goodness of Spartacus but what can i do if this film came just an year after Ben Hur. And i don't need to tell you about Ben Hur and it's impact. Spartacus is very good film though, i was expecting a Classic from Kubrick and it didn't happen with this film at least.RATING - 7/10*By - #samthebestest",7,0,0,28 May 2020
Casablanca," Every time i watch Casablanca it leaves me SPEECHLESS !
","CASABLANCA (1942) :-Every time i watch Casablanca, it leaves me speechless. This isn't the first time i am watching Casablanca and i am not reviewing it in typical manners i do for other films but this is just an appreciational essay and haters please stay away. There has been so much said about Casablanca for 7 decades but when someone like me as an young audience in 2020 says that this film always leaves me speechless, you know something is more than special about this film. I have seen so many classic films from Hollywood and recently i have been watching daily 2-3 films during lockdown. Then i just thought, let's watch Casablanca again to realise what other films are lacking, and somehow i am intended to write these words not to review Casablanca but just to appreciate it little more.One thing i am sure about is, there will never be another Casablanca. For many reasons, Casablanca remains one and only of it's own kind. There were so many classics made on Love Story, Love Triangle, War, escape, Drama, Sacrifice and Emotions but none of them could make one perfect mixture of all them like Casablanca. The writing of Casablanca is a lesson for every writer who wishes to write an Intelligent film that will be remembered forever. The conflicts in Casablanca are summed up so cleverly. There is Love story, there is betrayal, there's Love Triangle, there's crime, there's Patriosm and then there is Mind Blowing climax that stayels with audience forever. I have always wanted to see at least one film that will use sentiments intelligently in the climax and my search ended with Casablanca. When everything seems like going Perfect in the film all you expect is a perfect Climax and Casablanca hits the best shot ever in those 15 minutes of Mind-blowing climax. It also taught some positive fellas that a sad, negative, intellectual and unparalleled ending works much better any typical happy ending. I don't think there will ever be any film which will beat those 'Intelligent Sentiments' of Casablanca's Climax. And believe me nobody does it better than Humphrey Bogart.I just can't imagine anyone else saying, 'We will always have Paris', and 'Here's looking at you kid' the way Bogart did. I am still trying to understand that why didn't he won Best Actor at Oscars for Casablanca? Ingrid Bergman's character Ilsa is another fine example of classic writing. While most of the films make the woman look weak and dumb under love theories, here comes Ilsa the as one of the most balanced woman character ever. Ingrid Bergman just doesn't look Gorgeous but she performs gorgeously which is more important. There are several other important characters in the film like Victor, Renault, Ferrari and Sam. These characters are also written with same conviction despite the fact that these have minimal parts to play but they do leave an strong impact.Coming to the dialogues, Casablanca deserves one special seminar just to praise the Dialogues. I already mentioned two quotes from the climax but there are so many memorable quotes in the film. Even a small character like Sam went away saying one of the most honest and powerful dialogue, 'Please leave him alone Ilsa, you're a bad luck to him'I don't remember Michael Curtiz's name for any other film except Casablanca. He might have been unaware of what he was going to achieve with Casablanca but my friend nothing can beat the glory of people knowing your name for that one Masterpiece you make in lifetime.Films like Casablanca doesn't come often but when they come we must feel blessed. I was born in 90s, almost 5 decades after Casablanca but i still love this film more than any classic film of my era. The film has had an unmatchable impact over the years and i am sure it will continue having so even after completing 100 years. I am almost finished with most of Classics from 40s decade and there's no hesitation to say that, Casablanca is the Best film of 40s decade'. That's a big compliment when you know that it was the golden phase of Hollywood. If someday i catch a better film than Casablanca from 40s decade then I will surely let you know but for now this is it. A Masterpiece that changed typical mindset of Hollywood folks on Romantic Dramas, love trainglesa and noir (if i can say). Ask me anyday for a recommendation and Casablanca will always be there in my List. We will always have Casablanca in our hearts.RATING - 9/10*",9,0,0,3 May 2020
The Big Lebowski," Already a mess, which could have been told decently but this is very feeble..
","The Big Lebowski (1998) :
Brief Review -Already a mess, which could have been told decently but this is very feeble. Crime comedy is one genre i always hated because comedy is something which doesn't belong to crime scenes unless it is a Black comedy. The Big Lebowski is a mess that couldn't have been handled any way but dipping in into comedy made it impuissant. There must be some reasons that this film has 8.1/10 rating on IMDb with approx 699k votes but i couldn't find one reason in the film. The story of a so called 'Dude' but a dead head who is mistaken as a millionaire gets involved in a kidnapping conspiracy and manages to acknowledge the whole mess. There isn't any thrill, nor any suspense. All you got is vulgar and abusive dialogues to entertain you in the form of comedy, and nothing else. Everything runs like a mess in the screen while you keep looking for one sensible thing to happen but at last all you get is disappointment. This adds more to that the actors in the film too behave irresponsibly while facing camera and you can easily notice thier dialogue delivery is a complete, big fumble. I rather like to laugh on jokers than these insensible artists. I just didn't understand what Joel Coen and Ethan Coel wanted to say? Were they trying to make me laugh with abusive jokes or were they trying to thrill me with funny laughable suspense? This whole thing is a MESS. A mess that cannot be justified or systemised at all. Forget watching it again, i already wasted my 2 hours in first watch.RATING - 5/10*By - #samthebestest",5,0,0,7 May 2020
L.A. Confidential," A promising crime drama with few shortcomings..
","Short Review :-
Watched LA Confidential (1997)
A promising crime drama that has a few shortcomings. Not a complete thriller nor a complete drama yet grips the scenario with lot of conflicts and then shortfalls to it's own content. Let me see what i liked, Outstanding performances by Russell Crowe, Guy Pearce and hot as hell Kim Basinger, the screenplay with a pace, director's conviction to get the story to the end. The things didn't work for me are, The Prostitution angle and the love story made on it, The overall conclusion on corruption and mainly those cops covering up thier troubles for the sake of the image in public. Maybe, this is not something i expected especially towards the end when you just don't get enough thrills and realise all this drama and backdrop hunt was made to destroy a simple Porn-chain. Ain't it just too less for a Film that has been loved by critics and audiences? I could be the only one to dislike the film that much but yes i have my own views. I could be wrong or i could be right, i don't know, i better fall for a film with a better and strong climax that should really inspire Cops and help them to fight against corruption. Overall, LA Confidential is a promising crime drama with some deficiencies in it's content and we have seen so many better and Cult films in this genre.

Deadpool 2," A Non sense yet funny ride
","DEADPOOL 2 REVIEW :
Have you seen Stand up comedy shows where rehearsed, intentional skits and performer do anything to make you laugh without caring about whether the jokes are relevant or not, without caring about logic but still manages to put a smile on your face, Deadpool 2 is that sort of film. I hate watching hollywood films in dubbed version but sometimes less appealing and adult films don't get enough showtimes so i had to adjust and compromise this time, and this film proved me right that why i hated watching dubbed versions. So many non-sense and irrelevant jokes, PJs and trolls does make you laugh but that makes Deadpool 2 to look a Stand up comedy skit more than a Film.
I have to add spoilers in the review because then only you will understand why i called it irrelevant and non-sense. Firstly, Deadpool's Girlfriend is killed and to see her again in soul's world he also tries to kill himself but then his girlfriend tells him to keep heart at the right place and DP decides to help a mutant boy from other mutant who has came from future. DP builds a team in 2 minutes and then entire crew is dead within next 2 minutes excluding DP and that Lucky woman. How foolish is this to attend all this team X force stuff just for 5 minutes screenplay? Film keeps going on with such non-sense jokes and fortunately succeeds to entertain, DP trolls everyone like DC Universe, Avengers, X Men to make you laugh especially in Hindi dubbed version when DP mouths Dangal, Bahubali, Partner PJs but after some time this looks so intentional and purposed stuff. How long can you bear it? And then predictable time spinning and over dramatic climax ends this entertaining ride in style and i felt like Deadpool 2 entertained but failed as a film.
Overall, Deadpool 2 is Good one time watch but doesn't have that simple flow which it's predecessor had. Everything looks so over dramatic, so over-laughable that it's completely foolish to call Deadpool 2 better or even as good as it's Prequel. Watch it once if possible but No repeat value at all. I give 6/10* which is less than Deadpool 7/10*",6,0,2,19 May 2018
Thor: Ragnarok," Visually Spectacular, Grippy so does Best Thor Film till date.
","THOR RAGNAROK REVIEW :The one thing i always liked about Thor series is that they never gave a long run time film, they always believed in keeping it short and grippy. Thor Ragnarok wins half race here, rest half is won by Terrific Visuals, Massy Writing and throughout tight screenplay. Film has a quick beginning and may be that's the point where film keeps you hooked and it remains same till the End. Doctor Strange's Cameo is Pleasing. The villain Hela is powerful and her back story is well written. Thor's 'Revenger' team is Great, you see some more addition in Marvel's superheroes list. That anticipation of Hulk's entry worths the wait as he arrives with the bang. Climax is well crafted, every thing is used perfectly by Director. Background music is decent. Cinematography is Excellent. Visual Effects are so good that i declare this one the as the most Visually spectacular film of Thor Series. Editing is Brilliant, no chance to point a finger. Direction is Very Good, could have been better but when everything looks good i don't think it's fair to talk on minor mistakes of director. Overall, Thor Ragnarok is a Perfect Money Making entertainer from Marvel. Marvel just can't disappoint with a good Superhero film. If you're a Fan of Marvel's superheroes films then Thor Ragnarok is a MUST SEE for you. Classes and masses both will love it, especially mass lovers. No doubts, Film will be a huge success at box, get ready for Highest Grossing Thor Film. Go for this one and have a BLAST, i guarantee you will not be disappointed. 7/10* by me, i would have loved to give 8/10 but i think a massy film does not deserve that rating even if it's too good.",7,1,6,2 November 2017
Crash," Heavy and dark but a positive dose on racial and social hatred..
","Crash (2004) :
Brief Review -Heavy and dark but a positive dose on racial and social hatred. Crash is a story of society varying cultural thinking and traditional mindset of people that brings some positivity for sure. Set in Los Angeles, Crash tells a story of several people with different cultural thoughts about other cultural people and that somehow is more about hatred than the kindness. But by the time film ends it reverses the mindset by giving an important message on humanity and sociality. There are multiple characters in the film with regional and cast diversity such as Black people, White People, Persian People, Arab and even Chinese people. The trick here of taking all the stories forward simultaneously set in different conditions, different place and then colliding each other logically works smoothly. Some people had to die, some are survived so you feel sad but it was part of the narrative and people shouldn't take it negatively. Director Paul Haggis took a gutsy script and delivered it accurately. He made all the actors act naturally. Despite so many characters and so many racial events, the film loses pace at some occasions which is reluctant. Apart from that you need a positive thinking throughout to understand what film want to say about humans and thier behaviour. Couple of incidents will make you emotional, some will leave you with a guilt and some will disappoint you but the overall impact still remains fantastic. Crash is a Perfect Film to win Oscar as Socially important films have always been favourite but Crash did actually beat contemporaries in 2004. A Classic !RATING - 8/10*#samthebestest",8,0,0,8 June 2020
Spider-Man: Homecoming," Spider Man Updated Technically.
","SPIDERMAN HOMECOMING REVIEW : I'm a Spiderman Fan from childhood, old Spider Man films series (3 films) is still my favourite. The Amazing Spiderman couldn't match the class of that old Spiderman but i liked it for some advanced technology used in it. Now comes SpiderMan Homecoming, Another spidey film excited too much before release, don't know how but i started expecting Best Spidey film ever but this one too couldn't match the standard of Old Spiderman series.Good Performances, Good Story, Excellent 3D Effects, Enough pacy screenplay but a disappointing Climax spoiled the film. Obviously, one expect breathtaking fight sequences in the end but here you don't see Hero fighting hard and beating Villain. Villain gets thrashed very easily, i mean come on man where is much expected Explosion? Where is Entertainment? Story is Good, Marvel keep making films on Avengers and Spiderman Homecoming script is suitable for MCU. Iron Man and Happy's presence is pleasing. You get to see Captain America's glimpse too (TV). Screenplay is Slightly slow paced in the first half then takes pace in second half but all goes in vain because of too simple climax. 3D effects are Excellent, this film must be watched in 3D only. Cinematography is very good, especially in Spidey's action sequences. Direction is on lower side, you expect more comedy, more entertainment, more explosion but director focused more on story and setting platform for MCU's upcoming films.Overall, Spiderman Homecoming should be watched once to see advanced and technically updated version of one of the most loved superhero Spiderman. He does everything what an Avenger do, oh sorry Iron Man do. With better climax this film would've been better than The Amazing Spider Man but it failed. Go for this one, just don't expect too much, definitely don't expect too less, there's certain space between it to enjoy the film. 7/10* stars by me.",7,1,7,7 July 2017
The Best Years of Our Lives," Tragedy of War veterans turned into a Moving and Classic Film..
","Short Review :-Watched The Best Years Of Our Lives (1946)Tragedy of War veterans turned into a moving and Classic Film. There have been films made on War, some friendly some anti war some were action films some were explosive but i haven't got to see a film on War heroes after they return home. How difficult and somewhat humiliated it could be for War veterans to earn respect and money at the same time after dignified experience in War which is useless in civilian's corporate life. The Best Years Of Our Lives finally breaks the shell of this topic and also creates a warm atmosphere along with heart touching love stories. You know while watching this film i was literally praying that, please God this is going so good please this should end on happy note and guess what it ended so beautifully. Oscar honoured this Classic film but IMDb users should have brought it into Top Rated 250 films, we gotto be ashamed little bit. Well, coming to the film's prospects i don't really see much to be criticized as Acting, Writing, Screenplay, Dialogues, Production and Direction all fields were absolutely fantastic. The film with 170 minutes of runtime won Oscar for Best Editing, do i really need to say more now? William Wyler does marvellous job while crafting this story i mean linking 3 War veterans lifes, troubles and their love Stories is a sign of Intelligent filmmaking. And the way he crafted all the diamonds like Myrna Loy, Fredric March, Dana Andrews, Teresa Wright, Virginia Mayo and surprise package Harold Russell in the film truly made all those shine brightly. Now just one compliant i personally felt there should have been one speech at the climax of all 3 heroes sharing their experience from War and how they gave Best Years of Their Lives for the country. This one scene would have made it a Masterpiece. Well, 7 Oscars for this film against films like 'Brief Encounter' and 'Its Wonderful Life' proves that juries had tough time at 1947 Academy Awards.

The Grapes of Wrath," Not a film but an Inspiration to beat out tough time, because 'We are The People'.
","Watched 'The Grapes Of Wrath' (1940)Short Review :-Not a film but an Inspiration to beat out tough time, because 'We are The People'. John Ford is the man who does it and who else it could have been. He brought possibly the most inspirational film for people in the beginning of 40s decade. Next year he also brought another people's film 'How Green Was My Valley' and these 2 films changed some people's lives forever. When you make a film from experiences of people gone through tough times it becomes mandatory to end the film on high note and if it's inspirational then there's no stopping. The Grapes of Wrath is just not a film, it is something more than that. I can imagine how people would have reacted to the film in 1940 if i am reacting so enthusiastically in 2020. A story of poor family who have been thrown out of thier own land and how they battle out all the difficulties will surely leave you with an heart wrenching experience. In a feature film aspects, The Grapes of Wrath is work of a genius, truly. There are some brilliant scenes in the film that will force to you take a note that this kind of genius filmmaking was done in 1940 and anyhow you have to believe it. Acting of the long studded cast is fantastic but Henry Fonda and Jane Darwell are too good. The writing seems fantastic even after excluding few scenes from the novel. Dear John Ford why you so awesome? How did you manage to pull out an inspiring tale in early 40s like never before? That last speech of Tom Joad while leaving the family and Ma Joad's Inspirational words in the last scene will always stay with me. 'I'll be around the dark, I'll be everywhere' and 'We're the people that live. They can't wipe us out'. Inhale with pride and i am done here.RATING- 8/10*By - #samthebestest",8,1,1,28 April 2020
Justice League," This Above Average film by DCEU has got Enough Explosion to be called a Safe film.
","JUSTICE LEAGUE REVIEW : It was one of the Most Awaited flick for me during pre release period but later Critics reviews declared it an Average to Below Average film and i lost all that year built excitement in minutes. Let me say it straight, i'm not reviewing a Great film, i'm talking about Average film so if you see any soft corner about any field then that means Average one not even Good.Justice League starts very slowly, looks like a bore flick for first 35-40 minutes and then picks up smartly. Later it continues the flow but after every explosive and entertaining scene there're 1 or 2 minutes loo breaks followed. Don't know why it happens, why film gets slow for few moments when screenplay was in top form? Then enough explosion at the end and later one surprising factor after end credits saves this Average flick to look an Above Average stuff. We've seen Batman, Wonder Woman and Superman in prequel and i'm glad to welcome 3 new guys in the team, Aquaman is Good, Flash is too good, Cyborg is decent. Some musical scenes feels irritating. Runtime is shorter than 2 hours and thanks to the editor for that but how could he trim that Superman's re-entry scene from Trailer (Alfraid says, Let's Hope you're not too late) ? Superman's Returning is slightly curved towards emotional bonding but it doesn't work at all. Villain is powerful but a fairy tale and retro look doesn't impress much. Visual Effects are Brilliant, could have been better for 3D viewing. Direction is messy, Snyder either needs to improve or needs to be removed from DCEU. We're waiting for One Good film from him and we're still waiting. Thanks to Jenskine for that one good film Wonder Woman otherwise Snyder has almost finished DCEU. Why he always go for a Dark film, why can't he just go for some fun and light moments like Marvel? Overall, Justice League is an Above Average film, obviously not that bad as critics said. Chuck the critics and go for it, those who liked BvS will surely like this and those who did not like BvS will also find it an Average One Time Watch. Enough Explosion and action in middle and at the End makes this one to worth your ticket Purchase. Talking about Box Office this one should do decent business in the range of previous 2 DCEU films or might even struggle to reach there while $1 Billion club is out of reach. I'm going with 6/10* and hoping for better a sequel which will have a League of Villains (This might be a spoiler).",6,10,17,16 November 2017
Dangal," Another Classic from Aamir but this time a Tribute to Mr. Phogat
","DANGAL REVIEW :- 'Dear Sam, remember the day 23 Dec 2016 when you watched Best Film ever made on Wrestling.' This is what my heart said to me after the very first sec i finished watching Dangal. Without wasting time let me elaborate my views about Film. Acting - Aamir Khan does excellent Job, not the Best of the year but surely in top 5. Never saw Fatima before but she was the Best among star cast. Sakshi Tanwar, Sanya Malhotra got limited screen space and gave their Best. Supporting Starcast is good too.Writing - Excellent ! I Don't except better story/writing than this for any Wrestling based film (It was expected due to Biopic Thing).Screenplay - Notable ! It really keeps you hook from the first frame to the last, especially in last 30 minutes.Music - Good but not the Best. Reason is, expectations from Pritam are always high. Not a single Filmy Song, every song is situational so Video Songs looks better than Audio. Background Score is Awesome, helps film in emotional scenes.Cinematography - Average ! Its good actually but Nothing impressive except those Fight sequences. Some scenes are pacy and some are Slow, overall Average. Direction - Nitesh Tiwari at his Best. He has succeeded in Whatever he wanted to present to audience. He is The real master behind this Classic, with any other director it would have become typical Filmy movie but Nitesh kept it strictly as an Art Film which is needful for Biopic like this. In some scenes he loses it, few scenes are too filmy but receives Claps and Whistles so i must say he wanted to keep it Classy but forcefully added some Massy scenes. Will meet him soon and thank him for giving us Classic Called Dangal.Final Words - Dangal is not a Commercial film like PK and 3 Idiots i mean some Massy elements and comedy is missing which is needed for high Repeat Value so i believe this film won't get that High level success which these films got. It is less in Quality compared to Epic Taare Zameen par and less Commercially compared to PK, it misses the Masterpiece Tag just because of few scenes and minuses but it is another 'Classic' by genius called Aamir Khan. He gave 2 years for the film and it worths. Film has many Goosebumps and Emotional moments which you will remember even after leaving theater. It worths your money, it is Best Film of the year among all High Budget Film released so far, i recommend don't miss this film. And last thing don't even think to compare it with Sultan cause it will be like comparing Sachin Tendulkar with Murali Vijay. 8/10* stars by me. And last but not the Least 'A Grand Salute' to the 'Mahavir Phogat and his Family'. True Heroes like him needs to be recognised for their Hardwork in our Country.",8,15,27,23 December 2016
Apocalypse Now," Slow and confusing but a landmark in War films with sheer reality.
","Short Review :-
Watched Apocalypse Now (1979)
Quite slow and confusing but if you get it then there's no limit. A landmark in War epic films with tough frozen reality like never before. I don't know how it fares with the historical accuracies but i will just talk about a cinema or a feature film and this is something hallucinating on human nature and it's effects. Francis Coppola's visionary film on Vietnam War could feel bore and quite confusing at the end but there's something most realistic that we haven't seen before. Either you understand it and love or you hate it completely, it's that much unpredictable. If someone really knows about this scenario already then there would more to judge rather than just a movie buff (like me). Apocalypse Now is an remarkable achievement in Cinematography, Sound and Production design and those 2 Oscars dolls came for the deserving guys. I personally found it slow but many times slow poison works more than the Normal one, let's see if i can love it more after the probable repeat watch. At the moment, this got everything in all fields of a Classic filmmaking.

Dunkirk," The Mole, The Sea, The Air... The Nolan's Classic. Best Film Of The Year so far.
","DUNKIRK REVIEW : I don't care which genre film it is, i don't care who's the leading actor in it, i don't care about the banner, but if it is Directed by Christopher Nolan then i will watch it in theater at any cost. Memento says Nolan is Great Director, Inception says he's the Master, The Dark Knight says he's the Best, Interstellar says he's not from this planet and now after Dunkirk i'm sure Nolan is not from our Milky galaxy. No Superheroes, No Fictional Explosion, No Action, No long Speeches, you don't even see a single enemy, only Class and strict story telling without any loo breaks, OMG... Only Nolan can do it. You have keep patients to watch Dunkirk because you won't see much entertainment factors, you have to keep your mind steady and wait till film ends and at the end all your efforts worths it.Dunkirk is a simple story of Soldiers evacuation but Nolan has told this ordinary story in extraordinary way. He has made the film as a triptych, told from three perspectives – the land, sea, and air. And he's succeeded like a boss. Hans Zimmer's Background score is something which keeps you hooked from the first to last frame. Sound designing is something which should grab a bunch of awards next year. Cinematography is Top Class, without 3D effects this film is a visual treat and the reason is Hoyte van Hoytema shot the film on IMAX 65mm and 65mm large format film stock. Editing is tight and much better than Nolan's last film because run time is less than 2 hours so film doesn't lose the grip for a single moment, while Interstellar was a longer affair and there's hardly any moment where you can divert your attention. Film is Technically superior hence, better than all previous war films but explosion and repeat value wise, a slight let down.Overall, Dunkirk is another Classic from Master Nolan and is a Must Watch for every Nolan and Classy Cinema Fan. I kept expectations sky high and film completed all but hasn't surpassed so i won't call it a Masterpiece. This isn't Nolan's Best Film till Date, i found Interstellar much Classy, but Dunkirk is in top 5 of Nolan's. Without thinking much and wasting time, i request you Be a Smart Cinema lover and watch this film in Theater only. Do not even think of watching it on TV because Dunkirk is just not a film, it's 'An Experience' which has to be experienced in Theater, go for IMAX screen if possible. I strongly recommend this film, and i guarantee your ticket money will worth it. 8/10* stars by me and Salute to Nolan for giving us another Classy piece of cinema, i feel blessed that i'm born in an era where i can watch Nolan's Classics in Theater, keep giving us that, love you.",8,1,10,23 July 2017
Captain America: Civil War," Marvels just cant disappoint you with a Superhero flick.
","'CAPTAIN America : CIVIL WAR' REVIEW :- We all loved Marvel's previous Superhero flicks, this is another addition to that list. Makers tried to add more fun this time and they have succeeded in it. Obviously if they are making sequel that means audience deserve more fun than the previous one, this must be the thinking of Makers when they decided to make this movie. Marvel has a separate movie for each superhero then they made Avengers to bring all superheroes together and Civil War follows same idea. Too many superheroes, 2 teams and their face off. Wow sounds great no? Movie starts with kick ass action sequence. Keeps you hooked for first 30 minutes then some necessary scenes to set a plot which gives you loo break. Then after Interval movie is bit of slow but then last 40 minutes are brilliant. Spidey's entry and his presence made it more entertaining. End is quite Emotional (not actually) and bit disappointing or exciting, depends on your choice how you take it. Film wins your heart by its special effects and those scenes are eye pleasing in 3D. Screenplay could have been better but it is not bad either, usually this kind of films are not made to entertain you for complete 150 minutes and you know it. Runtime looks 10 stretched. Story is good and bit a confusing but it ends on satisfying note. Acting is perfectly showcased by all leading stars. Sound work is good too, especially in action sequences. Cinematography is something to clap for. As a whole Film entertains you, doesn't make you feel bore and won't let you think that you wasted money on it. Go for it, enjoy this another Money making entertainer by Marvels. 7/10 stars by me.",7,8,17,6 May 2016
The Conjuring 2," Enough Horryfying and Scary to give you Jitters, a well deserving worthy Sequel.
","THE CONJURING 2 REVIEW - Yeah Finally watched it in theater and got a feel of watching a scary horror film in theater after a long time. Couldn't watch The Conjuring in theater but loved it when i watched it in Mobile so i was eagerly waiting to watch The Conjuring 2 in theater at any cost. Expectations were little bit higher and movie pretty much matched that level. Follow my Details - Acting - Good but not upto the mark. Reason- Director didn't give much attention to this field as this is a horror flick not Cult Classic cinema. Still i feel Acting could have been better by all actors. Writing - Very Good ! Story has been written very well, twists and realisticness deserves appreciation. Screenplay - Fantastic ! Screenplay is very tight from the beginning till the end except starting 10 mins which takes time to set a plot, then movie takes pace and keep you hooked till the end. Dialogues - Average ! Nothing impressive, ordinary dialogues and really can't expect much from a True Story. Cinematography - CLASS ! Wow, great work by cameraman. Most scenes have been shot in Dark, Each and every angle looked scary and eye pleasing. Direction - Good but not Great. It is a sequel so obviously everyone will compare it to its prequel and that's why i think Direction wasn't as great as previous one. But still a praise worthy work by a Director, its not easy to complete people's high expectations (Because its Prequel). Film looks tight from its beginning but loose Climax i mean The Conjuring had longer and more interesting climax than this. Here Director failed badly, he could have easily make Climax little bit more scary and interesting but i don't know why he didn't do it. Final Words - Not better than The Conjuring and Despite having bit of loose climax this one is a Must Watch for all. Film will definitely leave you with an scary impact and jitters. Go for it, and enjoy another Breathtaking, Scary and Dangerous experience from Hollywood. 7/10 * Stars by Me.",7,0,1,11 June 2016
M.S. Dhoni: The Untold Story," A Good Story spoiled by Stretched Screenplay
","MS Dhoni The Untold Story Review : Bollywood is making so many Biopics in recent time. Few Biopics failed Critically + Commercially and some received tremendous success Both Critically and Commercially. Among all Bhag Milkha Bhag is my favorite and its Classic so to beat it the Film has to be Masterpiece. Coming to The MS Dhoni's Biopic which was expected to overtake BMB because of Excellent trailer but Film is not up to the Mark hence not a Classic. May be it is because of Trailer's magic which took my Expectation to the next level and Film failed to reach that level. MSDhoniTUS is a Fine example of a Good Story spoiled by Long stretched Screenplay. Story had the potential to make a Classic Film but Unnecessary Songs, Very long Runtime and Few Predictable twists made it a Good Film which should've been Classic actually. Anyways, MSD's story is an inspiration for those who dreams to become a Great cricketer even if they are from Small town or village. His struggle is shown perfectly in the film but his success was not shown with the perfection. VFX work is excellent where technical team have put SSR instead of Dhoni in Cricket match footage. SSR gave performance of his life but variations in character weren't there so he's not my favorite to win Awards. Supporting Starcast is impressive as well. Music is let down, till interval music doesn't irritate you but after interval it does. Screenplay which is 184 Minutes long is bit boring and very stretched, film could have easily been trimmed for 30 minutes by removing songs and few melodramatic and some unnecessary scenes. Cinematography is good but not excellent. Thanks to VFX and Stadium scenes which are eye pleasing and enough to give you Goosebumps. My favorite scene from Film is When Child MSD asks his Mom to buy Sachin Tendulkar's Poster. Direction is let down, Neeraj Pandey is Class Director so even small mistake from him will be considered as big. And Considering his last 3 Films (Baby, Special 26, A Wednesday) this is his Weakest Film till date. Coming to the box Office predictions, Film will have great weekend and good run at Box Office. Film should join 100cr club and i don't expect anything less or more than this. Overall it is a Good and One time watchable Flick which had the potential to become a Classic but spoiled by couple of mistakes of Director. Go for it and you won't come back with a disappoint face. 7/10* Stars by me.",7,3,8,30 September 2016
Avengers: Endgame," GIVE THE LOUDEST SCREAM FOR YOUR SUPERHEROES !
","AVENGERS END GAME REVIEW :-
Marvel took a decade to set the 'End Game' on high standard and that plan has worked big time. We can feel the buzz, the hype all around the globe. Finally the Final Chapter in Avengers saga is revealed and does it live upto the hype? Yes, it does. Avengers End Game has every freaking element of heavy Commercial entertainer along with moving climax for die hard Marvel lovers and a fulfill end to the journey.End Game was awaited for the one final Slash on the deadliest villain who killed half the universe with just one snap. People were excited to see how remaining superheroes battles with Thanos and do they survive? The script is 180 minutes long which is perhaps the longest film in Marvel Cinematic Universe so as expected it takes time to settle the atmosphere. Unexpectedly, Russo tries some Intellectual kind of stuff to get it right but leaves so many goofs which remains unanswered. After getting it right, since 140 minutes are gone, finally you get to witness what you actually wanted to see in this film from the start. The visually stunning phenomena takes charge and you just can't stop screaming out loud for your favorite superheroes.The climax fight is followed by bit of emotional portion where you have to say goodbye to your superheroes. Marvel ends it good, but is it good enough? Is there anything new to see? Answer is No. End Game is the same Marvel stuff we have been watching since a decade, except that one segment where all the Marvel Superheroes comes together for the first and last time. Russo tried thier ordinary version of Quantam Physics but doesn't explain the theory till the core, in addition they took so much time to set the plot. Overall, Avengers is a complete Winner package and will rule the box office but it is not that High level Cinematic Experience which can be remembered for years. If tou like all the previous films of Marvel Cinematic Universe then this is something more for you, so don't miss it.RATING- 7/10*",7,0,2,26 April 2019
Gone with the Wind," 'She was a fool' but it took her 4 hours overlong runtime to realise it..
","Brief Review :-Watched Gone With The Wind (1939) :She was a fool but it took her 4 hours overlong runtime to realise it. Well, i remember watching this film in parts in childhood days when I had no sense of movie reviews. But in last 10 years I realise how legendary this film was and I wanted to watch it in a 'Single Viewing' and somehow I couldn't manage that due to its 4 hours long run time. Today during the lockdown i finally got to see it in 'One Take' so that i can review it properly. I guess I have said so much in the first sentence itself. I always wonder that why the most watched film of the industry never makes it to the Rank 1 in Best Films List well, there are surely reasons for it. Those films where legendary blockbusters in that time because it appealed to that particular audience of that era but it doesn't mean the film will have timeless magic. Fortunately you see most of the Top Rated films of all time are not legendary blockbusters but, as Feature Films they are much Greater than Huge Commercial blockbusters. I would like to add 'Gone With The Wind' in that list. It may be the Legendary and miraculous film of it's time and there is no denying to that but how does it stand today? Recently, I have seen several timeless Hollywood classics which came before GWTW and even today i found them Greatest of all time and not Just of their times. GWTW has a grand scale, so many conflicts but somehow those so many conflicts aren't enough to make a one Best scenario out of it. I was expecting a Clark Gable's show since i have loved him in several classics films before GWTW but in the this film it was moreover Vivien Leigh's show. The entite narrative is about her and she certainly did a great job. Clark Gable got the enough boost in second half of the film and i liked the way his character ended. I felt like, 'Those days when Men used to be like Men' and 'Women used to be like Women'. The latter part is fully justified by Olivia De Havilland's character but not by amateur and fool character of Scarlett. A story of a manipulative woman who is love with a married man who doesn't love her and the woman doesn't understand the man who man truly loves her, ain't a great stuff. That one thing hurt me more than anything else. When the centre character of the film doesn't seems to be making a sense then i just couldn't help myself. It took her so many years in the film and 4 hours of the runtime to realise that 'she was a fool' and audience realised it in first 10 minutes. If there had been something intellectual or even sacrificing stuff at the end, i would have still loved it more than now. I would definitely love to praise the director Victor Fleming for such a Big and intense film. The production value, dialogues, presentation of the War period, costumes of big cast all these deserves admiration even after 81 years of it's release. No one can take away their credit and Oscars honoured them all. Now coming to the most important point what's there so much in the film for my generation when we have seen so advanced, so complex and almost all kind of films by now then i am afraid i couldn't recommend if you're looking something extraordinary. One should watch it to relive the Legendary Blockbuster all time but you cannot expect the Best film of all time because we got some high time Cult Classics for that. A film with almost 40 crores Footfalls cannot be called Overlong or boring or useless feature film but yes it is Overlong for my generation at least and not boring surely. Nevertheless, this wasn't a problem in 40s and 50s decades that i am sure about. On my personal thoughts, Gone With The Wind could have been a better film and i wouldn't have minded if it had not been such a big commercial success. There would be some people who agree with me and surely there would be some bashing me but i think they shouldn't bother because this review doesn't really matter after 81 years.Rating- 7/10*",7,0,1,23 April 2020
Toy Story 4," 4th CLASSIC IN A ROW FOR THE FRANCHISE, CRY AGAIN FOR TOYS.
","TOY STORY 4 REVIEW :-
Toy Story is one of those rare Franchise which can be considered as complete series. We had few other franchises too but Toy Story has that 'One Complete Film' every freaking time, that's something brilliant. I remember how hard i cried after watching Toy Story 3 and since then i always felt like this is the Perfect End, Pixar shouldn't take it further. There were many reasons for that such as Emotional Connect, Heart touching End and one of the Most Important reason was matching the high level phenomena is Impossible. Others might have failed but Pixar does it again. Toy Story 4 is 4th Classic in a Row for the Franchise and if i am not wrong then this is the First and only Franchise to achieve this feat.The way Toy Story 3 ended i couldn't imagine any sequel and if i had to imagine then it has to be a Classy as hell. That time it was about Human's Emotions for the toys and this time Toy Story 4 deals with Toys emotions towards Humans. I hope everyone here is friendly with every character of the film and may be that's why Pixar tried connecting our emotions with the Toys. Fortunately they succeeded. Toy Story 4 has perfect mixture of Entertainment, Freshness in the Script, Sacrifice, Friendship values and last but not the least That Emotional Connect. You may not cry for the Goodbye this time, because this Goodbye has vibes of New Beginning hence making Toy Story a Franchise to remember to the Infinity and Beyond.Taking the story forward since Toy Story 3, this film has some new entries and also some old friends reuniting. The conflicts remain same but the emotions and the perspective is changed. You feel for New Toys, Old friends, thier Friendship, thier sacrifiece and most importantly you feel for Woody and that's what Pixar wanted. At the very next moment the race of Classic Film is won by Toy Story 4. Although it failed to match it's predecessor but you know Toy Story 3 is unmatchable therefore going somewhere close to that film is a Big Achievement and that is done in soul stirring way here. In final words, Toy Story 4 adds another glorious Chapter in Toy Story Franchise and Pixar's basket. If you connect with the Toys of these franchise then believe me you can't to miss Toy Story 4.RATING- 8/10*",8,28,52,22 June 2019
The Fault in Our Stars," The fault is not in the Love story and Emotions but the Fault is in the additional Metaphorical theory.
","The Fault In Our Stars (2014) :
Movie Review -The fault is not in the Love story and Emotions but the Fault is in the additional Metaphorical theory. I remember skipping this film when released because i had read the synopsis of Novel and i thought it won't look exciting due to predictable plot. Now i thought let's give it a watch because the bollywood remake is about to release and it would help me to decide which adaption was better. In bollywood we have seen such love stories already, may be not exactly as it is but very similar and proudly more emotional so i would be eager to see how Dil Bechara is shaped. When i went through the basic story of the novel 6 years ago i didn't really find anything allegorical but yes it sounded very emotional and heart touching. I have seen many of that stuff too so again its like losing little more interest. Anyways now i have seen it and i would like to point out some mistakes instead of admirable things because mostly emotions end up making less sense. But no need to take this review so negatively, i am saying it before i begin bashing that i would still recommend this film to everyone so you please watch it regardless of what mistakes i point out. The Fault In Our Stars does full justice to the love story and emotional story from the original novel but couldn't overdo the metaphorical proportions when there was a golden chance. I don't need to explain about the love story and emotions of this film because they definitely work and are difficult to hate. The problem is in the detailing of the plot and metaphorical portion which has been sidelined for the sake of emotions. See, there is a girl with thyroid cancer who falls in love with a cancer affected boy who has a great sense of humour. He brings the happiness in her boring life and all that portion is presented beautifully in the film. I started loving the film in first 10 minutes only which doesn't happen regularly. The dialogues and scenes in the first 50 minutes were wonderful and shockingly intellegent. Then the film lost the grip when most of its humourous quota was finished, this is where the film came one step down from it's high level. Next, the metaphorical and subtle thoughts were sidelined because we are not so smart audience and we love to see typical emotional and love theories instead of intellectual stuff. Then onwards i begun to search for mistakes in every scene and the level was one down again. I just wish what if the level was kept solid high throughout? The film would have ended as an Unforgettable Classic. I just couldn't understand how all of sudden the guy with great sense of humour started behaving like a common man? Was it because he fell in Love despite knowing that his life gonna end soon? Didn't he have that much brain to understand it? Does falling in love means you should lose your intelligence? On the other side, that so called girl who is Smarter than others has nothing to freak out than just meeting an author of book? How can she be so desperate for such a small and ignorable thing? When did she behave smartly to be called smarter? Wait a sec, her parents had money for the expensive treatment since childhood but has no money for one freaking trip to Amsterdam? Poverty? Seriously? The author has been given so much importance nonvigilantly, what's his role in the film actually? How did he help in the impact of the story? It was just another Normal character. Now one of the biggest problem is the climax scene. Well, the climax is not a problem, the problem is not elaborating the connection of it to the earlier scene when the girl tried to avoid the boy for his own betterment but at last she realises that he already knew it. That's metaphor but many people didn't get it because it wasn't presented smartly. Technical errors of the film cannot be ignored, such big errors they are. Cinematography and editing is so bad occasionally. Finally coming to the positives, the acting of both the leading actors is fantastic. Laura Dern in the side role was adorable. Dialogues in the first half are amazing, clapworthy and highly sensible but as bad in the drag moments of second half. Direction is very good considering the aim of paying more attention to the emotions and love saga but like i said, i want to repeat again, the Subtle and Metaphorical proportions of the film deserved to be explored in terms of Greatness. Overall, a Very Good and Adorable film but unlikely to work as a tear-jerker and unlikely to be called a work of a Genius.RATING - 7/10*",7,0,0,30 June 2020
Lawrence of Arabia," David Lean grows Greenery in the Desert...
","Short Review :-Watched Lawrence Of Arabia (1962)David Lean grows Greenery in the Desert. 226 Minutes of pure filmmaking lesson from Legend David Lean. Lawrence Of Arabia is claimed as One of the Greatest Films ever made, although i disagree bit i also agree bit of it. Biographical drama and adventure comes together with majestic form of Cinematography and storytelling. One can complain about its long runtime but those were the days when they used to make Good Films with full content rather than money making spicy things like now days. Don't forget that 226 Runtime still won it Best Editing Award at Oscars. David Lean did a spendid job again just after The Bridge On The River Kwai in Lawrence Of Arabia with top notch directorial and presentation skills. A big cast is well handled and well trained to showcase absolute great acting skills but unfortunately couldn't win any Oscar. Peter O'Toole as Lawrence, Anthony Quinn as Auda and Omar Sherif as Sherif Ali take over the screen as if they were real characters. If i am praising David Lean for a wonderful Spectacle then Cinematography of F. A. Young and Music score by Maurice Jarre deserve special mention here. Overall, Lawrence Of Arabia couldn't connect me as it did to Arabians and Englishmen due to historic background but it is still enough to be called a Classic as a Mainstream Film.Rating- 8/10*",8,0,0,19 April 2020
Avengers: Infinity War," Entertaining & Blockbuster stuff but why such incomplete and complicated end
","AVENGERS INFINITY WAR REVIEW :A wait of so many years, an anticipation built through so many superhero movies and wait for Super Villain finally comes to the end with Large scale visual spectacular called Infinity War. I was so excited but kept expectations low as such superhero flicks entertain you but usually lacks the content. Infinity War is Super Entertaining, it has all the elements what one expect from Marvel's Biggest Film ever but why such Incomplete, complicated and negative end? 
Film starts on the good note, doesn't take too much time to set unlike other Superhero films. Thanos looks so powerful and we don't wanna see our Avengers looking so weak for the first time. We expect them to smash Thanos but we'll have to wait for Infinity War 2 for that and that's where film looks slightly incomplete at the end. Watch out for the post end credit scene, that might increase your excitement for the sequel. When film ended i felt like it's Interval and i want to see more, but have to wait 1 year more for that. Poor me. Film has so many pluses but has got some minuses too. Let's take a look at them.
Pluses- Visually spectacular, goosebumps while seeing so many superheroes together and their strong come-Backs, Strong Villain, pacy screenplay, Comedy, Explosion etc.
Minuses- Heroes looking Weak in front of Villain, unnecessary love making scenes between few avengers, useless emotional scenes between Thanos & Gamora, Lose climax, so many unanswered questions.
Overall, Avengers Infinity War is just another Entertaining film from Marvel, nothing Extraordinary despite gathering 20+ superheroes in a single film. Film worths the long wait of viewers but nothing memorable to be left with. Film left viewers with more questions than answers. The excitement for the film was so high that some fans even went on to predict that this film will beat Box office records of Avatar, Sorry to say this, forget Avatar but even $2 Billion can't happen with this Product. I will not say you should skip the film but i can't even strongly recommend you. I'm going with 7/10* which is same as almost every superhero film from Marvel has got from me. Last but not the least, there are No such things called spoilers like who dies in the end, so many disappears but only to come back in a style with Infinity War 2.",7,1,6,27 April 2018
The Lion King," THANK YOU DISNEY FOR RETAINING THE NOSTALGIA
","THE LION KING REVIEW :
Animated Classics by Disney went on to cross the age barriers and box office calculations 2 decades ago and are stills remembered after so many years. The Lion King carrying immense popularity and high standard was never an easy task to be remade, yet the big names attested with product left us with some hopes. Thankfully Disney and Jon Favreau succeeds in retaining the Nostalgia of Original Animated Classic after 25 years. The quality of original classic can never be matched, it is always about going somewhere close to that level and The Lion King doesn't fail to walk on the right path.The Lion King is story about, as we all know King Mufasa murdered by his own brother Scar and then his Son Simba returns to aquire his Father's Kingdom. It is just not about the revenge, it is about Pride, honour, responsibility, being a True King and a Saviour. There is too much in this one narrative along with emotional Bonding and hilarious characters like Timon and Pumbaa. Firstly, the execution of such a big film is done excellently by makers. Disney does not compromise or reduce that Big Scale adventure. One could have never imagined animational biggie coming in live action on this much big canvas. Of course the credit will go to VFX makers as they not only create the fictional world but also made us believe in it. Screenplay having no loo breaks and dull portion is like tremendously turbo speed engine which picks up at the start and runs throughout till the end. Musically it was even a bigger challenge in this remake and fortunately that quality has been kept intact. Hans Zimmer returns to compose those lovable song and you're gonna love 'Hakuna Matata' anyways.From the director's point of view The Lion King lioks uncompromised, untouched and healthy remake. Jon Favreau missed something with The Jungle Book but this time he tried to bring everything possible from the original Saga. As a whole Jon Favreau's The Lion King retains the nostalgia of Roger Allers and Rob Minkoff's timeless tale in Mainstream Commercial entertainment attire. It might just fail to stand upto some people's expectations who have experienced the original one and kept it in heart forever otherwise, new generation gonna experience old wine in new Glass. Exclude those some people and you will definitely like it equally compared to the 1994's Memorial, oh sorry slightly less would be Great.RATING- 7/10*",7,0,3,19 July 2019
Amadeus," A miraculous biographical drama set in correct tunes..
","A miraculous biographical drama set in correct tunes. Even if you don't understand much about music and tunes Amadeus will still take you along, that's how powerful it is. I never thought Opera could be so meaningful and profound as i have seen in Amadeus and that too when i don't really understand anything about it. There are so many biographical dramas made over the years but no one came with this kind of uniqueness and proper use of fictional writing. Amadeus is story of Legendary Piano artist Amdeous Mozart but the story is told by guy who used to feel jealous of him. The entire narrative is driven by negative character which doesn't really feel negative when the film ends. Like he says, how could god take him away just to stop mediocrity to have a little share of his glory. Wow, wow, just wow... Amadeus will always remain special and different for this reason that the villain doesn't look a villain and the hero goes less admired than him. In Musical aspects Amadeus explodes all the correct tunes with top class presentation of Opera. F. Murray Abraham won Oscar for the portrayal of Antonio Salieri and the dominance was damn too high. Tom Hulce gets the madness right, his face expressions and that funny laughter seemed amazing. Elizabeth Berridge as her wife gets little enough to do. Coming to the most important person behind this miraculous presentation, the Director The Milos Forman, how do i find words to admire him when i feel like have used all adjectives already for others. I just wanna say this, Dear Milos Forman thank you for showing an art of storytelling in feature film attire. The Combo of Art cinema and motion picture rarely comes together and Amadeus is one fine example of it. I happened to see Director's Cut yet love it so much and soon will catch theatrical version and will surely love it even more than now.

The Man Who Would Be King," John Huston's another Favourable lesson on Excessive Greed after The Treasure Of Sierra Madre.
","The Man Who Would Be King (1975) :
Brief Review -John Huston's another Favourable lesson on Excessive Greed after The Treasure Of Sierra Madre. The Man Who Would Be King is another triumph for director John Huston on the subject of excessive greed and written destiny. The Treasure of Sierra Madre was a Classic film and it has remained an iconic film for years but despite the influencing factor The Man Who Would Be King separates itself because of adventurous and regional plot supported by historical names. Two British former soldiers decide to set themselves up as Kings in Kafiristan, a land where no white man has set foot since Alexander the Great but one of them tries to be mighty by fooling priest in the name of god. Who could ever beat destiny and so does the climax implants expected perishing stuff. The film has 3 main characters of Sean Connery, Micheal Ciane and Saeed Jaffery and all 3 of them have done great job. The beauty of the film lies in it's cinematography and locations because adventurous plot needs to be told in that way. If you can't get locations and Cinematography right then adventure will never look an adventure. Screenplay tackles all the conditions perfectly whereas dialogues are mostly in regional zone. John Huston took up the same subject but explored it in totally different manners with the help of different characters, different shades, different era and different storytelling. Anybody who liked The Treasure Of Sierra Madre with definitely like The Man who Would be King but certainly the impact won't be same, though it won't be too less. Nevertheless, getting close to it is a victory for any director and especially when the director remains same.RATING - 7/10*By - #samthebestest",7,1,3,7 May 2020

","PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN : DEAD MEN TELL NO TALES REVIEW - I have seen all previous films of this Franchise on TV unlimited times and enjoyed each one of them. But i never got a chance to watch Captain Jack Sparrow on Big Screen and today i got the chance and i couldn't resist myself. I wasn't expecting much but was expecting a Fulfill End to the Franchise and i enjoyed the film a lot but not upto the mark. Script and Logic wise this is the weakest film of the franchise but still it didn't fail to entertain you as promised. Captain Jack Sparrow's charisma saved the weak script and dull direction. Beginning 15 minutes are let down and then Johnny Depp aka Captain Jack Sparrow arrives and takes the charge of the Ship. Once he arrives film doesn't lose the tempo but some illogical scenes irritates you. For instance, Pulling a house with the help of 4-6 horses is not acceptable, sometimes gravity doesn't exist, no specific reason to why Barbossa die. Excluding these minuses film has everything to entertain you with it's barrier. I don't think any other Actor would have done the role Jack Sparrow as Johnny Depp has done. All 5 films of the franchise revolves around his character, others disappoints but he kept entertaining us. Thank you Johnny Depp for playing memorable Captain Jack Sparrow with such an ease, you will be remembered for years as Mr. Sparrow. Editing of the film is tight, probably shortest film of the franchise. Cinematography is Good. 3D effects and Visuals are excellent except few scenes. Comedy and dialogues could have been better. Direction is the weakest aspect here, i don't understand why Director went away from the line and tried to make good logical film, a fictional one. Overall it is slightly down but yet another Entertaining film from Disney's Pirates franchise. You will get what you want to see, just don't keep expectations high. Hopefully it is the last film of the franchise and i think it was a fulfill end to the most entertaining franchise ever, so i would like to thank Disney and Johnny Depp for giving us Pirates series and Hilarious Captain Jack Sparrow. Go for it If you're a fan of the franchise or Johnny Depp. Compared to previous films i must say each film of this franchise has lost some comedy and some logic consistently with each upcoming film. POTC1 > POTC2 > POTC3 > POTC4 > POTC5. I'm going with 6/10* as i found this one as One Time Watch, but will watch on TV many times only because of Captain Jack Sparrowwwww....",6,1,9,27 May 2017
X-Men: Apocalypse," Best film of Xmen series i've seen.
","X-MEN APOCALYPSE REVIEW - Finished watching one of the most Anticipated Hollywood flick of the year XMen Apocalypse and i am thrilled. Kick Ass, Faadu, Brilliant, Outstanding and bla bla, in 1 Word (in Indian Language) K A D A K.... Certainly Best Xmen series film i've watched. Better than previous Xmen films, Avengers Series in short Best Hollywood Flick of the year 2016 so far. We usually don't expect Quality film making and script from Money making entertainers but if we get Good Script with lots of entertaining elements then we call that film a Classic and exactly same happened to me after watching Apocalypse. I don't call it a Classic but yes Film has surpassed my expectations and has forced me to watch it again in theater. Probably first Hollywood film of 2016 which i will watch 2nd time in theater. Excellent writing, Tight screenplay with zero loo breaks, Outstanding VFX and 3D effects and a perfect paisa vasool entertainer as a whole. Xmen Apocalypse doesn't disappoint you in any field. The main reason is its screenplay which is entertaining throughout for 145 mins despite very less comedy. Visual effects and 3D Effects are best for any Hollywood film recently. First half lefts you on interesting note which doesn't easily happen with other money making entertainers, and then 2nd half completely surprises you with Good worthy a perfect climax. Wolverine surprises in his 2 minutes cameo. Erik's son is surprising element because of its Lightning Fast speed super power. Overall i don't have any minuses to count, this is a Perfect Entertainer for Hollywood lovers. I'm giving 8/10 stars which is really high for this kind of Entertaining Genre film. Go for this one, if you're really looking for a perfect Hollywood Entertainer and i'm sure Film won't disappoint you.",7,8,17,20 May 2016
The Last Emperor," An ornamental theory to tell the story of an ambitious emperor who did not deserve it.
","The Last Emperor (1987) :
Brief Review -An ornamental theory to tell the story of an ambitious emperor who did not deserve it. The Last Emperor suggests very much by its title that it is a story of the Last Emperor of the Forbidden City, China who was nothing but an ambitious child who cultivated his own empire, reformed it and destroyed it too. The inception of an idea that he's an Emperor and he can do anything he wishes was done when he was just 3 years old but by the time he grows he finds himself trapped in World War and Republication of China and Japan. The story doesn't really offer anything extraordinary in terms of writing skills but it had to be honest to the available data even if it doesn't fit really in any cinematic or dramatic proportions. And anyways it doesn't really connect to the audience who doesn't know or care much about China and Japan's history. Well, i am one of them. Besides, i had to like to it as a Cinematic achievement, that's a fact. Director Bernardo Bertolucci delivers a very much watchable and interesting film using all the cinematic properties like locations, screenplay, production design, cinematography and gripping storytelling in systematic manners. The performances looked convincing and so does the characters, doesn't matter of they don't stay in memory by the time film ends. It's about spending those 160 minutes without feeling lazy and The Last Emperor succeeds in keeping the laziness away. Overall, it's a very good biopic and even a Fantastic must watch but only if you care so much about China or Puyi's history. Biographies are meant to rule Oscars and this just got lucky otherwise who cares about this film as we do for other memorable Classics.RATING - 7/10*

Jurassic World," An awesome,thrilling entertainer but only if you like money making entertainers
","JURASSIC WORLD Review- When i watched its first trailer i was stunned. Too much visuals and those horrible dinosaurs in trailer gave me jitters. Obviously its not first time we see it in Hollywood but it was something different for sure. Everyone was waiting for this horrible experience to release in theater so does me. My expectations were simple i just wanted an entertainment i wasn't expecting quality or good story from movie and after watching the film i can say i am completely satisfied with the movie. It entertained me lot,it kept me busy. I never feel bored while watching it. Makers never wanted to make it as critical acclaimed movie they wanted to entertain people so here they have made a complete money making movie. We have seen dinosaurs in movie before and enjoyed it but this time its not natural its man-made. Story is not that much good but screenplay is very tight and with short 2 hrs runtime it feels much much tight. Visual effects were damn awesome and in 3D its much lovable,it will blow you. If you will ask me what i liked the most in this film then it will be their technical work,vfx and eye catching visual effects. Direction was good. Director cared about what audience want from film and he gave it to us. Sound effects were thrilling it gave me goosebumps. Actors had nothing much to do in film cause film is centralized on dinosaurs still all actors did quite good job. Overall an awesome entertainer which you cant afford to miss. It will give you jitters,goosebumps and dinosaurs will scare you will blow you. Go for it 7 * stars by me.",7,4,17,15 June 2015
Avengers: Age of Ultron," Certainly better than 1st part
","AVENGERS : AGE OF ULTRON REVIEW- Just finished watching Avengers Age of Ultron.we know its marvel's money making series so we don't expect quality or class from these kind of films. We expect some eye catching action,stunts,vfx etc. and film fulfills all these needs. Here we gets a perfect sequel. We see more action,more destruction,much stronger villain in case of visuals . Story seems little bit similar to bollywood flick Ra.one but we know its Hollywood which never let us down. Awesome VFX,brilliant action sequences,eye catching 3D work and fairly good story makes this film a must watch. All actors have done a great job as they did in their previous films. Story is not that much great but screenplay is really better what we look for. Director made it pretty good to watch and makes sure we don't get bored. It keeps us to the edge of our seats. But the technical team has won the battle here they have done an excellent job here to make this sequel better than its 1st part. If you are looking for another action movie from marvel then you can't afford to miss this one. Probably this sequel is updated version of its prequel,and certainly much better as well. So go and watch it to experience some awesome visual effects. Kudos to the entire team for making a better sequel than our expectations. Best movie of Marvel till date.",7,5,13,25 April 2015
Hotel Mumbai," A WELL MADE DRAMATIZATION OF TRAGIC EVENT !
","HOTEL MUMBAI REVIEW :-
26/11/2008 is one of those horrible night for all Mumbaikars and the entire Nation when we saw cruel face of terrorism striking innocent souls. There were plenty of books on it and one film was also made in Bollywood. We all know the events, we all saw some real footage but most of us doesn't know what happened inside Taj Hotel that night. Hotel Mumbai by Anthony Maras focuses on all the incidents happened in Taj Hotel. Apart from cruel face of terrorism the film deals with the humanity and shows us how people supported each other while they were fighting for thier lives that night inside the hotel. Although the film is based on Documentary called 'Surviving Mumbai', ofcourse there are some fictional changes to make it relatable and dramatic.On 26 November 2008, young waiter Arjun (Dev Patel) reports for work at the Taj Mahal Palace Hotel in Mumbai, India, under head chef Hemant Oberoi (Anupam Kher), who reminds his staff that 'Guest is God'. The day's guests include British-Muslim heiress Zahra (Nazanin Boniadi) and her American husband David (Armie Hammer), with their infant son Cameron and his nanny Sally (Tilda Cobham) as well as ex-Spetznaz operative Vasili (Jason Isaacs). That night, 10 terrorists, directed by a man known as 'the Bull', launch a coordinated assault against 12 locations across Mumbai, including the hotel. As the local police are not properly trained or equipped to handle the attack, they can only wait for special forces to arrive from New Delhi. How do all people fight for thier lives, thier struggle, thier pain, thier courage and lastly thier unity are the part of this beautiful script.When the script is strong, you know the screenplay and execution should not take it down, and that fear is well very handled here. Almost 130 minutes of the screenplay are engaging enough, doesn't matter if some scenes goes quite lose. Climax takes care of the content that we wanted to be in safe hands. The presentation of Breathtaking sequences, explosion, gun fires, blass is done in proper manners. Additionally, Background Score is terrific which takes those scenes little higher. Director Anthony Maras does what Indian director failed to do with the same content. His sensible mindset doesn't make Hotel Mumbai look like a forced drama or over the top bravery tale. He has given a realistic touch to the film and that works.It is hard to forget those screams and lost lives of that horrible night but Hotel Mumbai coming after a decade is a perfect showcase of that tragic event. It lacks some other events happened at Kama Hospital and Girgaon but we have atleast seen them or read about them somewhere, what we didn't know was brave decisions made Taj Hotel Staff members and the film brings them in spotlight. Overall, Hotel Mumbai is definitely a one time watch for it's brilliant writing, execution and direction. Mumbai's audience will connect with it quickly and we hope the entire nation also connects with it so Go for it...RATING- 6/10*",6,0,2,26 November 2019
Chariots of Fire," A Fire within fills Chariots to run on passionate path. BREATHTAKING !
","Chariots Of Fire (1981) :
Brief Review -A Fire within fills Chariots to run on passionate path. Chariots of Fire is highly motivational concept but moreover it is a breathtaking experience. I can't tell you how my heart was pumping faster and breathing speed increased during the final scenes. The story of 2 athletes who are passionate about achieving something takes you on a pacy ride of inspiration. If the conflicts are to believed then Chariots Of Fire has such a connectable and admirable fictional changes that you will totally love the leading 2 characters of the film. Abrahams is determined and so is lovable and Eric is even better, more focused and God worshipper. Like other films, Chariots of Fire doesn't make any competition at all between 2 leading characters and that's so positive thing. Just imagine, you have 2 characters in the film fighting for the same destination but they never have fights, differences or any hatred about each other. This is unbeatable ! That's something out of mainstream ideology and if it appeared so early in 80s means it is ever more special. Ian Charleson and Ben Cross give honest and dedicated performances. I just wonder how come none of them won Oscars? Hugh Hudson does a remarkable thing in athletes films history as he finishes race just on time and makes it to the top of the list. The background score and cinematography is top class and deserve a special mention in this positive review. Overall, Chariots of Fire is a must see for all the athletic lovers but as a motion picture it has got everything for film lovers too. I may not see such a breathtaking pacy ride anytime soon. This is Terrific ! The chariots of fire just fire all the way and the burn needs to be experienced by all. Just 7.2/10 on IMDb... You kidding? You all should be ashamed for making it underrated.RATING - 8/10*By - #samthebestest",8,0,0,20 May 2020
The Artist," Silence speaks louder than Words! An Extraordinary Storytelling of an Ordinary Story by French Cinema.
","#TheArtist (2011) :
Brief Review -Silence speaks louder than Words ! An Extraordinary Storytelling of an Ordinary Story by French Cinema. Experimental Film-making at its Best! The Artist takes you back to 1927-1932 when Silent films were ruling Hollywood untill Talkies arrived. The story of The Artist is written by Michel Hazanavicius and seems like he was a great fan of 'The star Is Born' (1937) and 'Singin' In The Rain' (1952) and he wanted to remake these films but morally couldn't do the copy paste so he decided to write a fresh story which will be a combination of these 2 retro Classics. The Artist is about a popular silent movie star George and a rising actress Peppy who later becomes sensation in talkies era whereas George sees a fall down due to the shutdown of silent films. They begin an unknown relationship in thier first two meetings but their careers set in opposite directions. Like i said the story of the film is ordinary and predictable but the storytelling is Marvellous. When Silence speaks louder than Words you can't miss the experience. The Artist could have been an average film if the Storytelling wasn't on high level like this. Every scene has deep meaning and hidden intellectual cuts we must notice. Entertaining elements doesn't make it look dark therefore it is hard to find a boring moment in this grippy runtime of 100 Minutes. If you ever wish to learn about quality filmmaking and how to put high range nuances in cinematic frame then The Artist is a complete syllabus for you. I loved it. I loved to point out those nuances in expressions, body frames, sound effects, cinematography and directorial efforts. Jean Dujardin packs a solid punch as an artist, yes i mean it, i didn't say actor i said artist because i haven't seen such an artistically brilliant performance like this recently. He took away a bunch of awards and he deserved all those. Bérénice Bejo is fantastic too, she managed to leave an impression during so many scenes. The silenct mourn by her looked even more emotional and impactful than any other mourn with sound. I have got couple of complaints for the writer because i had to call it an Ordinary story for some reasons. George's character character was a misfit to his behaviour. A popular star and a genius filmmaker having so much of pride and arrogant wasn't acceptable. He doesn't enjoy a happy married life and reasons are unknown (he didn't have any affairs). He declined working in the talking films as if he was a god and then it went untill suicide which seemed contradictional. At least he should have tried and failed, it would have at least made sense (negatively it would have hurt the climax). It seemes like Peppy Loved him since they first met but she never proposed him (same from the other side by George), she flirted with other young fellas but kept caring for him simultaneously. The relationship between George and Peppy was never explored neither it gets one crystal clear statement. It would have been better if they had either committed thier love or the respect for each other as an Artists but unanswered scenerio makes it go rough. Michel Hazanavicius did some mistakes as a writer but as a director there is not complaint to make, it was so perfect. Hats off.. This one would be a lesson for all the people who dream to become a great director. Don't miss The Artist and don't you dare blink or move your sight from display or you will miss some cinematic masterstrokes. I hate Oscars but i love you for choosing this experiemental French Classic as Best Picture of 2011.RATING - 8/10*",8,0,0,8 June 2020
Rocky," That one Inspiring sports drama which always leave you pumped up..
","Rocky (1976) :
Brief Review -That one Inspiring sports drama which always leave you pumped up. Sylvester Stallone wrote an inspiring tale and powered it with his own solid acting and dedication to bring a cumulative result as one hard-hitting film that evokes all low dreams fellas. A small-time boxer gets a supremely rare chance to fight a heavy-weight champion in a bout in which he strives to go the distance for his self-respect. At the end he reaches the distance but the hardwork he had done deserved a lot more actually. Rocky might be a predictable film but the climax is always like a pumping station to get your nerves. I would have expected a victory at the end but it isn't there or may be it there but needs different perspective to look at it. In 2 hours of runtime the last fight hardly takes 8-10 minutes and the rest period still doesn't fail to keep engagement and pace at all. Sylvester Stallone looks so cute i mean i expected a hard narrow minded rough fella but he looks innocent unexpectedly. The choice of actress too looks interesting as she had to look sober at the beginning and beautiful later. Talia Shire suits perfectly in that role. Rest of the cast is good too and doesn't look dull anywhere. John G. Avildsen begins the film on a slow note, gives it a push after the first half and then blows up the real fire at the climax. May be that smooth going factor is missing but anyways the content is rich enough to survive the loss. Overall, Rocky is worthy enough to carry all the legacy since 44 years and hopefully it will continue carrying it. Sylvester Stallone as Rocky will remain immortal.RATING - 8/10*By - #samthebestest",8,0,0,17 May 2020
There Will Be Blood," Daniel Day Lewis is the only preservation for this slow paced madness and secretive ride.
","There Will Be Blood (2007) :
Brief Review -Daniel Day Lewis is the only preservation for this slow paced madness and secretive ride. There are people who completely hated this film and there are people who loved it totally, that's scarce. We don't see such films often which are either fully hater or totally loved but There Will Be Blood could be an exception because of the destructive yet mesmerising content it has. The film is about a silver prospector and his variational life focusing on his madness, greed, sins and religious hatred or belief (whatever you prefer after watching the film). There is not much wrong in the overall script but still the film is hated because it is slow paced and doesn't provide much screen space to the main content. On the other side, in a very short period of precisely 12 to 15 minutes in the climax it takes the film on high level and many people loved that part. I am somewhere in the middle now as i liked the way it ended and justified the overall context but i hated slow pacing too. Daniel Day Lewis is without any doubt the best thing happened to There Will Be Blood. Second and Third best things are Cinematography and Direction respectively. May be it could have been trimmed better especially in the first half which took too much time just to introduce and link all the characters of the film. Lot of mistakes were solved and covered in the second half and then Top Notch climax finished the job for the film. This is certainly a watchable film even in most negative talk because who knows one might find it subtle and profound which others couldn't find. You have power-packed performance of Daniel Day Lewis as a preservative already, so give it a watch to decide which side you are on. This is more a critic friendly film than being audience friendly hence you need to make a choice before giving it a chance. You can't expect an entertaining and light film so better be aware.RATING - 7/10*By - #samthebestest",7,0,0,29 June 2020
The Bridge on the River Kwai," Tactical understanding of filmmaking at its best..
","Short Review :-Watched The Bridge On The River Kwai (1957)Tactical understanding of filmmaking at its best. David Lean will go down in memory lane for giving some epic war and classy films that were ahead of their time. That doesn't mean he hasn't given non war films but his war films have been universally acclaimed. I have seen many directors and critics now days mentioning this film oftenly in thier speeches and the excitement started building up even more than earlier. The Bridge On The River Kwai is a fine example of tactically brilliant filmmaking. Why i say Tactically? Because you must know, you must understand what are you trying to show in the film and David Lean got all the tactics correct and like never before, never after. The film is visually spectacular but that just doesn't enough for a movie lover but it is about the entire scenerio that makes it a great film. Acting, locations, cinematography, presentation of that particular era everything is top notch and this is how the scenerio is made. It is not arguable that whether the film deserved 7 Oscars or not, but the question is, how far it lives upto the standard of those awards. Well, this one lives upto those standard by every mean. If one would have just gone for the grandeur then The Bridge On The River Kwai might have been even bigger film but it wasn't just about grandeur, it was about handling the Content with care. Overall, The Bridge On The Kwai River is War/AntiWar film that was made to set an example for upcoming films in this genre.

Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs," Presenting the First Ever Animated Biggie of World Cinema and Biggest Animated Hit of All Time with deserving Legacy
","Snow White And The Seven Dwarfs (1937) :
Brief Review -Presenting the First Ever Animated Biggie of World Cinema and Biggest Animated Hit of All Time with deserving Legacy. I don't know what achievements world cinema had seen in Animation by 1937 when Talkies were running riot at Box Office and Award shows but i know this that Walt Disney brought Snow White And The Seven Dwarfs and changed Hollywood cinema forever. I don't need to mention how Animated classics have been loved over the years but it is important to acknowledge that it all begun with this film. Snow White and The Seven Dwarfs is so amazing, beautiful, amusing and sweet film that i just couldn't hate it for moment. A fairy tale with fine touch of realistic world doesn't fumble at all and becomes a nostalgic mania. The story itself is so fascinating as we meet a Young and charming Princess who works as a Maid in her own palace because of her stepmother, a vain queen. She falls in love with a handsome Prince then runs away and starts living with Seven Dwarfs in the hills but cruel fate doesn't stop chasing her. I must say, the originality and completeness of the writing made many people to borrow the elements and bring stuff inspired from it. It has been influential for years and will remain so forever because such captivating stories will always work in any era. Creators put all the creativeness and innovative ideas into presentations and how? Possibly upto the last level of thinking of how could you present this scene with magical yet fascinating way. I genuinely felt what else could you derived in cinematic Liberty than this? So freaking awesome it is. Music is fantastic and pleasing which has the legacy for valid reasons. One of the biggest victory for the makers is speeding of the film because audience was experiencing something like this for the first time and if it had been slow and glide then engaging factors would have faltered. Fortunately, the film doesn't have a single useless and boring scene that can be overlooked or skipped even in repeat watch. Direction is just perfect I don't know how to explain it as i am not a kid but still enjoyed it like a kid. The commercial succe of this film was needed or else Hollywood would have never dared to make more Animated flicks and we would have missed many classic films. Nowadays we have so many animated films with innovative and highly intelligent ideas but what Snow White And The Seven Dwarfs archived 8 decades ago is REMARKABLE ! Disney kick-started the animated fantasy world with the bang and with and unforgettable experience. A Must Watch for any age, on any day and any time.RATING - 8/10*By - #samthebestest",8,0,0,27 June 2020
Stalag 17," Master Billy Wilder delivers a Cracking Classic escape of POW...
","Stalag17 (1953) :
Short Review -Master Billy Wilder delivers a Cracking Classic escape of POW. Among all the POW films i have seen till date, Stalag 17 should be called the Best. I would love to tell many reasons for that but i just got 2 perfect reasons to sum up all. First is, Stalag 17 came much before any other classic on same subject arrived, take 'The Great Escape' for instance. 10 years gap filled so many shortcomings of film technics but Stalag 17 still has a magic. Second reason is, Stalag 17 has got brilliant grip and entertainment. Most of the Escape flicks were too dark, too long and also seemed little bit boring in repeat watch but Stalag 17 is Funny, thrilling, captivating and re-watchable. William Holden deserved that Best Actor Academy Award like no one else among his contemporaries. There is a huge cast behind this classic and each and everyone deserves the credit for making this classic very much watchable by their excellent performances. Billy Wilder did something which all other directors have failed to do with this topic. I tell you i can't watch The Great Escape with the same joy on 10th viewing as 1st one but Stalag 17 would be in my watchlist any time, any day. With a perfect runtime of 120 minutes Wilder immersed all the elements of filmmaking whether is Comedy, Drama, suspense, sympathy and breathtaking climax. He created that atmosphere with every particular scene in the first 40 minutes and one we are in that world, there's no escape till The End. I don't remember any POW film having so many ingredients in such a short runtime. Stalag 17 is just Mind-blowing. Billy Wilder is a Genius and Stalag 17 proved it once again.RATING- 8/10*By - #samthebestest",8,0,0,2 May 2020
Platoon," Extremely atmospheric use of grounded content makes it just Mind-Blowing !
","Platoon (1986) :
Brief Review -Extremely atmospheric use of grounded content makes it just Mind-blowing ! War films have separate fan base and separate listing as far as the grounded content is concerned and Platoon surely makes it to Top 5 War films ever, i give you my words on that. Platoon creates the atmospheric radius around that you just don't want to go out of it. I wish to lock myself in a room in Dolby Atmos and watch this film again in 4K just to feel the atmosphere and check all the jitters again. Holy smoke.. The atmospheric tension gives some unforgettable cinematic moments and stunning vibes that leaves you all sweating even in air conditioning room. Oliver Stone wrote a shattering script but more importantly he delivered it on screen magnificently. The film has 120 minutes of runtime and this was probably a rare time that I stopped until the end credits rolled for like 5 minutes. I was glued to to my seat throughout and had to check if earphones fell down or what? Only one of the greatest War film could do it and that's Platoon for me now on. There are so many characters in the film that some of them might fade away from memory but thier small presence still makes it valueable. The big cast does big enough. Cinematography and Sound mixing are even bigger things to notice. When i first heard that Platoon won Best Picture, Best Director, Best Editing and Best Sound awards at Oscars against mighty competitors i doubted it but now when i am done watching it i can say, it made those mighty look weaker despite less budget. The grounded content like War and face offs of armies in forests is not easy to tell on silver screen but Oliver Stone was in no mood to accept it. 'When going gets tough, the tough gets going' he just nailed this saying like a Boss. A grand salute to the entire team of Platoon for this 'Stone-breaking' archivement. A film that must not be seen but must be Experienced..RATING - 8.5/10*By - #samthebestest",8,0,0,19 May 2020
Wonder Woman," Fulfills Normal Expectations but Slightly disappoints that High Expectations level.
","WONDER WOMAN REVIEW - Sometimes you expect less from a film and then you read some extremely positive reviews and starts expecting higher than your normal expectations and then even a Good film looks average. This is what exactly happened to me with Wonder Woman, i don't call it an average affair, it was a very good film and fulfilled those normal expectations but somewhere fell inches short to that high expectations level. Let me talk about every individual field :- Acting - Gal Gadot is Fantastic as Wonder Woman, but believe me she looks damn hot and distracts your attention from Acting. I think the whole idea was to make her look attracting and distract people from 'An Actor Gal Gadot'. Other star cast got nothing big and noticeable to do but they all were fairly good.Writing - We have seen WW's glimpse in BvS so when you visit her earlier life there has to be something satisfying reason and there is some great writing to set a plot to the glory of First Lady Superhero. Some logical mistakes are there but let it be.VFX and Action - Action sequences are brilliant, much better in slow motion. VFX work is good but 3D effects aren't up to the mark. Just for 5-6 minutes 3D effects scenes you have to wear irritating glasses for 2 hours.Cinematography - Good but nothing new. Few vertical and horizontal angles lefts an impression.Background Music - Excellent ! In Fight sequences Background score lifts the tempo up to the next level. And it's suitable for the Era shown in film.Direction - Thank god Zack Snyder wasn't director here, he disappointed with BvS so choosing Patty Jenskine has worked for DCEU. I can say she has given the Best film so far to DCEU. And i think choosing a woman director for a lady superhero film gave it some boost.Final Words - Overall Wonder Woman is not a Must Watch film but it is not a film to miss either. It completes normal expectations but slightly disappoints High Expectations, now it's up to you what you are expecting from a film. I'm giving 7/10* and i think this film will surpass everyone's expectation as a viewer and on Box Office too.",7,2,13,2 June 2017
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Keep your Mind at home, do not expect a classic and Enjoy this Entertainer.
","Batman vs Superman Review :- You all know how much we Indians love Hollywood superhero movies. We loved Batman and Superman both individually, so when i came to know that both the superheroes are coming together in 1 movie, went crazy. I kept very high expectations from movie because Batman is my favorite Superhero due to TDK series, and Trailer promos of course. Then heard some negative things about the movie just before 1-2 days of its release and lost all the interest but still i couldn't skip it. Now after watching i must say its a Good movie without any doubt. Neither great nor bad overall an one time watch entertainer. Its like getting 60% marks in exam after expecting 90%. Movie starts without any loo break, but till interval it doesn't offer anything new or interesting. Takes almost 1 hour just to set a plot, 1st half is completely disappointing and Dull. So obviously i had higher expectations from 2nd half and finally i got whatever i was expecting. Last 40 mins actually 35, excepting last 5 mins at the end defines entire movie. Actually i feel we can easily skip first half and watch movie from its 2nd half. Film's Runtime is long 153 mins and we get entertainment for 40 mins only and here film fails to impress. Story also looked confusing, took pace after 100 mins passed and then all the massy elements like Visual effects, action, fight scenes, destruction scenes which made the film to end on a positive note. Acting- i really never cared about acting field for any Superhero movie except TDK so its better to not talk about it. Music- really, do we get something called music from movies like this? Only Background Music is something for which we looks forward and even that is not so great in this film. You can call me mad but don't know why, my fanship level towards TDK is so high that whenever Batman's fighting scenes were going on, TDK Background music was playing in my mind. Story- It looked confusing till 1st half, but then 2nd half recovered all the failure of 1st half. They ended the movie with an interesting note that The Sequel is Coming, yes you read it right Sequel is Coming. Screenplay- as i mentioned earlier Dull 1st half, good 2nd half. Screenplay had too much to improve. They could have easily reduce Runtime to 120 mins. Direction- i don't know previous work of Snyder so i didn't expect Nolan's classic from him. Whatever he has done was not satisfying for me. Still his focus was good. I loved his vision cause he gave the much needed importance to Batman's character despite knowing he's human not an alien or a man with super powers. Batman almost killed Superman without any super powers. He didn't forget to keep Batman our favorite Superhero. Visual effect- its good but nothing great. I went to watch it in 3D and now i am questioning myself that why did i watch it in 3D, i mean 3D Effects were good for nothing i could have certainly watch this movie in 2D. Batman's get up & fight scenes, Superman's effects, Wonder woman's power scenes in her cameo and the Devil in the Climax etc. These scenes are something to appreciate for their technical work. Final words- Overall a good massy entertainer which you should watch at least once. If i compare this one with other superhero flicks then it is similar to Avengers and other superhero flicks except TDK series. If you loved money making entertainers of Marvel then you will definitely like this one. Go for it and enjoy 2 of your favorite superheroes at the same time, sorry its 3 actually. I would give 6 stars to the film but giving 1 star extra for my Favourite superhero Batman. 7/10 stars by me",7,0,4,25 March 2016
Ben-Hur," A Legendary Epic tale above Cinematic Boundaries..
","Watched Ben Hur (1959)
A Legendary Epic tale above Cinematic Boundaries. Take a Bow William Wyler 🙌 How on earth he made such a visually spectacular film without CGI. Hands down to the Greatest Cinematic achievement of William Wyler. Ben Hur won 11 Oscars out of 12 Nominations, the record which is unbroken till date and don't wonder why. I don't even think anyone will challenge this record unless categories of Nominations increase yet Ben Hur to hold highest percentage of winning out of number of nominations. Ben Hur is a that rare cinema which perfectly mixtures Commercial and Critical value and such films never get old, no matter how many films are being made today with advanced technology. There is lot to learn from Ben Hur to every film maker who wish to make a grand film keeping strong content in hand. Whether it is acting, cinematography, production value, execution, writing, screenplay, climax, message for humanity or grandeur, Ben Hur just does every freaking thing so accurate. Probably, the Greatest Film of 50s Decade and arguably the Best Magnus Opus Ever. I am happy that it was Biggest Grosser of the decade but i wish it should have became a Record Grosser. Not to mention those 3 Epic scenes which left me spellbounded even after watching the film 61 years post it's original release. The sea battle, the chariot race and the climax. That grandeur, scene making, visuals, those big sets are Magnificent. The efforts of entire crew and the Vision of Director for this Film is damn too high, i just can't think enough finding adjectives. I am happy to announce that i found a 10/10 film after a long time. I just didn't enjoy the Cinematic majesty but also i loved the content. Hats off to the Entire Team of Ben Hur 🙏

The Deer Hunter," I want to confess.. Frankly, i didn't get it..
","The Deer Hunter (1978) :Not a Review but a humble confession -Frankly, i didn't get it. Some people don't understand films, some understand but don't get it and here i said i didn't get it means i did understand it, i did understand everything happened in the film but i just couldn't get why it happened. The Deer Hunter is a story of 3 friends whose lives are changed after Vietnam war. An in-depth examination of the ways in which the U.S. Vietnam War impacts and disrupts the lives of people in a small industrial town in Pennsylvania. One friend is handicapped, i got this. Second one is back home but doesn't feel like home, why? I didn't get it. He's enjoying love affair with his friends girlfriend without any commitment and hesitation. Dear god please help me here. 3rd guy is gone drug addict and turned a killer gamer why? I didn't get why did he do it. These 3 people seemed like lost minded for me and may be that's why I didn't get the film. The Deer Hunter is one of the top rated and raved film of 70s decade but i didn't get it. May be because i am an Indian and i don't understand how just one war changes young lads lives although i have liked so many war effect films of old and modern Hollywood era. The performances by Robert De Niro, Meryl Streep, Christopher Walken, John Savage looked good. Length is about 3 hours in which hardly there are any enjoyable moment post first half. Michael Calimino's execution looks fine but the conviction seems lose over the content. I don't know why i didn't like the film as i should have liked, may be i shouldn't have written this review but why i wrote? I didn't get that either.RATING - 6/10*By - #samthebestest",6,0,0,18 May 2020
Jojo Rabbit," A funny take on serious idea turns into a thoughtful satire..
","Short Review :-Watched Jojo Rabbit (2019)A funny take on serious idea turns into a thoughtful satire. Well, we all know the results of Hitler's cruelty and Nazi who were obeying his order forgetting basic moral like humanity and Jojo Rabbit focuses the same issue but like I said we know the results hence film couldn't overtake it's predictability. Jojo is 10 years old lad who feels proud being a Nazi and want to crush all Jews but how would be the scenario when he falls in love with a Jew girl? Okay, i loved this idea and the funny theme also worked because intensity was low, light moments were in enough numbers. The best thing happened in the film is, the entire script comes from a little boy's point of view which is interesting. Also it is harmful because everyone around the boy has to be like him i mean less intelligent and cute. Jojo Rabbit falters because of it's predictability and irrelevant observation of Jojo's Character. However, his cuteness and thoughts made it look a really good film. After all Jojo and his friend Yorki were the cutest things in the film. Acting of Roman Griffin Davis and Thomasin McKenzie impresses whereas on sad note Scarlett Johansson and Taika Waititi doesn't get much do with their characters. I personally feel, Taika Waititi could have made it more impactful and more intellectul because the topic needs such thinking especially when you're adapting something you need to make it better. Rather than a good film, i would say it was a good attempt.Rating- 7/10*",7,0,1,23 April 2020

Amélie," This French Cinema's innovative characterisation and unique storytelling may be not be Outstanding but enough for a Classic tag.
","Amélie (2001) :
Brief Review -This French Cinema's innovative characterisation and unique storytelling may be not be Outstanding but enough for a Classic tag. Amélie is story a girl who spent her childhood alon thinking about world in abnormal way. Now in teenage she decides to give a push and an aim to the boring life by helping people and in the meantime she founds love of her life. This is a simple storyline and like i said it is not outstanding stuff or something and i hope you agree. But i must mention and admire the innovative characterisation of the film and the unique way of storytelling. The world in the movie is normal, it isn't fascinating and all but it is just that is has been shown from different point of view and makes us look at it from different perspective. I always have problem to praise the dialogues of non-English films because subtitles is something that disturbs cinematic experience. Améili therefore looks a dry beck in dialogue writing. Audrey Tautou is magnificent as Améilie. She looks innocent, naive and cute throughout the film and make you fall in love with her. All the other cast members are fine too. Amélie is just another different attempt to look at an ordinary writing, may be it works for some and some people might find it underwhelming due to high expectations. There's no denying on Amélie's writing and overall film being regular or maybe less but i would like to mention the characterisation again for its being highly innovative and connectable. Jean Pierre Jeunet has made a very entertaining and thoughtful film but lack of intellectual elements bothers a lot especially in the climax. But his unique storytelling style is worthy to make it a Must watch film as the cinematography and editing is not typical and non regular from regular films. This is really interesting to see if not the story. Améilie carries a high reputation on IMDb which surely makes it over-rated but then i am not against the Classic Tag. It is just that some films are great but known as Greater and Amélie is that Great film.RATING - 8/10*By - #samthebestest",8,0,0,30 May 2020
Incredibles 2," Pixar knows how to make a Sequel
","THE INCREDIBLES 2 REVIEW :
'Pixar does it again'... Whenever i see Pixar films this sentence has always made it to appear in my review/mind. Long wait of 14 years, so much anticipation finally comes to end with a Worthy sequel to The Incredibles. The Incredibles does entertain you throughout and on a high note tells some family values lessons as well. Comedy, humour, thrills everything is just perfect and so does the film.Story is about Superheroes are not legal, they should not use their powers which causes the destruction so they gotta stay at home like common people. Then how they survive from a conspiracy in a heroic style which better be seen in theater. We know 4 superhero characters in previous films and the addition of new cute little superhero is surprisingly amazing. Background music for the same is very effective and accurate as far as that particular scene is concerned. Cinematography is Excellent, especially in action scenes those moving camera angles will blow your mind. Visual effects are eye pleasing. Director has done a mind blowing job by keeping this excellent written product entertaining and engaged from the first frame to the last.Overall, The Incredibles 2 a Must See for Pixar Lovers, at some moments it looks even better than it's prequel. On a funny note i say, Marvel should take lessons from Pixar on how to make a Terrific Superhero film barring regular money making stuff. I never thought The Incredibles will have a Sequel and after watching The Incredibles 2 i want more and more sequels in this franchise. With a grin smile on my face, i rate it 7/10*",7,3,5,22 June 2018
Furious 7," Pacy last ride which gives remarkable end the franchise
","Fast And The Furious 7 REVIEW- Watched it with not so high expectations but movie is exceptionally good.i never expected much from this one but still movie surpasses my expectations.as we know there was nothing in script of last 6 parts so this one follows the same path.eye catching action sequences are just mind blowing.car stunts are beyond the imagination.all actors did good job in their particular roles.Dwanye Johnson has too short role than what we expect.movie begins with the introduction of baddie character and the movies takes pace.the chase begins to find an incredible tracking device.after 10 Min's of interval they find that device and then the baddies starts to chase them.in this chase and sequences movie comes to the climax.where we see non stop action and car stunt sequences for 20-25 minutes.as expected heroes win in the end and then director gives 4-5 minutes tribute to our beloved Paul Walker.those emotional scenes left us with tears,not fully but little bit.all i can say that the movie is too good than what we expect.a pacy last ride from the team.fulfill end to the 1 of the most entertaining franchise.go and watch it,classes and masses both will love it...For PAUL...",7,1,14,2 April 2015
