Coraline," Awesome real version needed ASAP
",Great movie I also would like a real version to it I know it would be terrifying with real people,10,0,0,23 May 2018
Scream," This movie was so smart
","I saw this when I was very young so all I knew is that is was so scary no super natural stuff...just real killing... white folks are crazy so stuff like this can actually happen...but I watched it again when I got older and the whole scream saga was awesome like how they set up the whole story about Cindy's mom and Cotton and gave just enough info so when the next 3 came out it was like reading a really good book or putting a puzzle together oh and I absolutely loved the fourth one....the only thing about this one where was all the parents? Lol everyone partying, hanging out and it's a serial killer out killing teens...but y'all know how white folks are notice no black folks in this movie lol this wouldn't happen with black people lol",10,0,0,20 July 2018
