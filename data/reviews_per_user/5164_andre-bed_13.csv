The Avengers," Very good movie
","This is a very entertaining movie. The characters are well known and the plot is simple and effective. This movie combines two important ingredients: fun and action. And the actors are very good too. I especially enjoyed Scarlett Johansson in the role of the black widow. She is really talented. Specially in that leather outfit.. The computer generated imagery ( CGI ) is impressive and the idea of the Avengers working as a real team surprised me in a positive way. The vibrant soundtrack helps a lot in the action scenes. Chris Hemsworth really convinced as Thor. This movie is good because it is exciting, funny, and it has some of the nicest super heroes from comic books. Congratulations Hollywood for one of the best movies of the year.",9,2,6,13 October 2012
Captain Marvel," A private is way better than this captain
","There is this politically correct idea in this movie. Captain marvel is depicted as independent, someone who suffered bullying while trying her career as a pilot in the air force, men lie to her, she is the victim, bla-bla-bla, a whole lot of political BS. The funniest thing in the movie is the cat and the most ridiculous thing is the way Fury gets his eye injured. Seriously, I almost walked out of the theater... The way Brie Larson leads the character is really disappointing, she looks like a distant, unemotional, 'all power girl' kind of character. The intention is obvious: please feminists with a 'kind of feminist super hero' Even Mar - Vell is a woman.. Boooooring ... There are even rumor that the captain is a lesbian.. Gosh, how much do they have to distort the story to please the 'Slay community' ??.. In case you want to watch a movie where a woman thrives for her career and position in a military environment I suggest you watch 1980's Private Benjamin. Way better than this 'captain'..",1,131,242,30 March 2019
The Hunger Games," An attempt to make an American Version of 'Battle Royale'
","This is almost a spin off from another movie. American audience is not familiar to 'Battle Royale', a Japanese movie ( and 'manga' 1999) made in 2000. What is this 'Hunger Games'? It's a movie that picked up characters, story, main sequence of events and all the atmosphere from this Japanese movie. The oriental production is far better than this American Version. Anyone who watches the original movie will agree to that. That said, It is important to remark that, in the end, the result of 'Hunger Games' was not so bad. But it was not good either.. American Motion Industry has been 'copying' movies for some time ( terror movies, for example ) and many of them are a terrible facsimiles from the original. This time the copy was not so bad. They changed a bit the story ( although the main plot is still there ) and adapted it to the American audience. The result is a teens movie that is possible to watch. Unfortunately, a lot of the emotion and originality from 'Battle Royale' was lost. I was in a bit of doubt between ranking it 5 or 6. I decided for 5, because I would say this movie is 'as half as good' as 'Battle Royale'. Not bad, not good. Interesting for teenagers and kids.",4,25,47,26 March 2012
Argo," Winner of the Oscar ?? Oh, please, give me a break !!
","The people in the academy must be nuts ! How can this be the winner of the Oscar ?? Art should be the winner. A good story with good values should be the winner. This movie totally distorts reality. Or, at least, what we understand for the 'official story' about the hostage crisis in Iran 1979. It plays with the following idea: 'the official history says the Canadians did everything, but let's say, in this movie, that it was the CIA and that, in fact, we made the world believe the Canadians prepared all the rescue operation'. Is it possible ? Maybe, but it belongs much more to the realm of conspiracy theory, than to what may have really happened. I admit the narrative keeps the audience interested in the movie, but that's all it has.. No good acting, scenario, picture, or direction And it got the Oscar ??? How come ??",4,23,43,24 February 2013
Ted," Ted....ious... ?
","This movie is NOT tedious. This is pure fun ! It's a great and funny way of seeing life with different eyes. It is like a connection between childhood and adulthood, linked by great fun, humor and criticism too. Those false moralists who piled tons of objections to it just didn't get the idea of the movie, which is very original in its conception and performance. Ted is, by far, a great wake up call for all of those who carelessly 'waste' their lives in a make-believe fairy tale where everything is idealized, sinless and 'pure'. The acid jokes, the society criticism, and the whole plot of the movie will lead you through a mishmash of sensations each will, ironically, put you to the test: What have you done of your life ? are you happy with it ? these are questions the movie does not intend to answer, but which are surely damn well right to be asked. Watch it and take your own conclusion.",8,0,4,27 October 2012
Underworld Awakening," Disappointing..
","I like movies about vampires and werewolves. But I cannot enjoy this franchise of 'underworld'. The vampires are boring. Even the wolves are boring. I expect so much from this franchise and it keeps failing me. I wanted to see scary werewolves, mean and blood-thirsty vampires, real beasts.. Unfortunately I see a movie with a tendency to tell the story from a point of view of the vampires. 'Noble' vampires.. and half of the movie is wasted with ' scary faces' as if they could showcase the real 'beasts' they are.. All in all is just boring.. The 'monsters' in this movie do not surprise anyone. They are terribly common and weak.. Poor portraits of what imagination could provide. Everything revolves around the character of Kate Beckinsale ( pretty worn out in my opinion ) and there are no characters you can really think: 'This one is a real bad ass'.. In a vampire and werewolf movie this is such a downer..",1,5,9,17 April 2012
Hugo," Awful...
","This is one of the worst movies I have seen in my life. Boring, slow- paced, vague plot ( with unnecessary characters ), no acting ( but a lot of staring ), with false expectations of adventure ( most of them seen in the ads ), overrated ( I cannot understand the '8' it is ranked with, hope it decreases fast ). This should be a film about the French movie- maker pioneer Georges Méliès. But the industry decided to lure us with a promise of adventure, mystery and magic. You will get none of them. And Georges Méliès sure deserves a much better movie than this one to tell his remarkable history. Unfortunately we get a hoax. Not at all attractive to children. Half of the people in the theater got asleep while 'watching' it. The other half just left in the middle of this movie ? Visually it is OK, with good use of 3D and some nice picture. But that's all. You will waste your money, do not watch it. Or, on a second thought, watch it if you want some nice sleep Oh, by the way. I found out Sasha Sasha Cohen can't be funny ( but be stupid ) and he can't act either ( his performance was terrible ).",Null,8,15,18 February 2012
Silver Linings Playbook," Pure C***.
","That was a real struggle to watch it till the end..Can I say what this movie is In one word ? Crazy.. Totally crazy. Not even a bit funny. The 'madness' shown in this movie ain't that extraordinary. As a matter of fact We all know some people with emotional problems, or who don't seem to be 'alright'. But there is, usually, a reason for that. That's what this movie lacks. A good point to base the behavior of the characters. Everything seems 'exaggerated' in this movie, even the problem of the characters and their feelings. On the other hand no one is 'normal' around the main character. Everyone seems to have some 'disorder' to a minor or major extent. But it's slow paced, most of the movie are people having arguments, there is this 'fixation' of the main character upon someone, a lot of 'blá-blá-blá', and so on.. I know American families are usually as crazy as this one, so I can understand the bonds American audience will have with it, but it is so far from my reality, so 'crazy' I couldn't relate. As for me ? Nah, it didn't work.",1,4,11,20 February 2013
Django Unchained," Horrible.
","How can this 'movie' be nominated for the Oscar ? It's way too long for such a shallow story. There are so many flaws in the script it is hard to believe in anything. There is a whole lot of blood, shots, and 'action' – this will suit Tarantino's fans who will achieve orgasm every time someone is shot ( 'Hey man ! Did you see that !?! he shot the guy between the legs !! ) Oh, yeah, great ( irony mode on ) Such a great 'scene'.. A whole lot of the same..This movie will satisfy teenagers, immature adults, virgins ( male; girls probably won't watch it, because it's too stupid and girls aren't as stupid as boys), fat nerds, etc.. people with a minimal brain activity will find it boring, gory and meaningless. BTW his 'triology' is really poor: Kill Bill, Inglourious Basterds and Django. All of them belong to the same place; the garbage bin.I can understand the high ratings ( the fans of Tarantino, who blindly accept every 'flick' of him ) but I really think this should be the end of Tarantino's 'career' as a director ( he could have the same end his character has in the movie.. ) and he should get back from where he came: a video rental clerk.In short: way too long movie, uninteresting, full of unnecessary violence, no real character development, etc.. That's not a movie you will leave the cinema thinking about, or feeling better, or even thinking. This movie belongs to oblivion and I hope it stays there.",2,1,7,20 February 2013
The Artist," Finally a movie that really deserved the Oscar !
","Finally the Oscar goes to a good movie. Kind of Ironic it is French and silent. But it is very touching. First of all, it has something that the recent movies of Hollywood lack: a good story that is well told. Not only did they have a good plot, excellent cast, a 'four legged actor', but they also manage to tell the story in a comprehensive way with the right amount of details to depict the life ( from glory to downfall and then back to an emerging career again ) of the main character. It has also brought fun back to the big screen, a romantic story without being too dramatic and yet able to capture the atmosphere of that changing time. It is a truly remarkable production, something we did not see for a long time in the big screen. I just can thank all of those who got involved in this project and truly believe that the seventh art is beyond mere special effects ( which are important, of course, but should not be considered as the sole reason of making a movie, as it has been lately ) – Thank God it is NOT in 3D !! - I know the movie industry is going through changes nowadays. Perhaps the answer is in the past, as it concerns which direction it should take.. Anyways, it's a great movie and the art is back to the Theaters !!!",9,10,19,27 February 2012
The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 2," The worst Movie I didn't watch...
","This is the worst movie I didn't watch. Yeah, I would never, ever pay to watch this piece of s***. All the spoilers I am going to talk about other people told me. So let's see: In the first part of this terrible end many things happen: Bella gets pregnant and.. and.. well that's it, nothing else happens. In the second part what happens is absolutely nothing.. The movie begins and stays like 30-45 minutes beating around the bush.. It was, in fact, an strategy of the producers.. They were giving time for the audience to leave the theather. It was just as if they said ' Hey, this c*** is about to begin, leave while you can !' Or suffer irreversible brain damage ( ops, fans of this movie are already mentally impaired ). The movie kind of start after 40 minutes and Bella is more confident, stronger, determined.. Finally there is a male figure in this relationship between her and Edward.. And she is the male, of course.. Jacob decides to tell Bella's father what is going on ( how come this guy doesn't know anything ? ). He starts taking his clothes off to tell Bella's father the 'Truth'.. How awkward can it be ? Why didn't he just say ? Aaarrtggh !! Bella's daughter face is made in CGI.. While you watch it you feel like her face is melting,.. Horrible ! After some weeks Bella's father sees her grand daughter again and the girl is the size of a twelve year old girl.. He just says.. 'Wow, you've really grown' What ??? Didn't he find it any strange ?? Aaaarrgghn !! Again ! Finally, there comes the only part of the movie which is interesting. The battle of the vampires. But before that the Cullens gang try to gather some of their friends and then it becomes X-Men. There are some vampires like Bruno Mars, two Russians, two Brazilian ( transvestites and Indians ) and they start showing their 'powers'. One vampire controls the elements, the other the electricity, the other one controls something by blinking his a** hole, etc.. Totally stupid.. And then there is the battle. Finally something interesting, real action scenes, vampires dying, etc.. But hey ! it was just a vision !! It's what one of the vampires sees in the future ! They decide not to fight and everybody goes home . NOTHING HAPPENS IN THIS S*** !! What a waste of time !!! G-zus ! How can anyone be pleased with this f***** S*** ?? Gosh ! Thank God I didn't watch it !",1,9,21,24 November 2012
Prometheus," Please, respect the audience feelings towards classics like 'Alien'
","I had to watch this movie twice in order to have a decent assessment of it. And I had to wait for the Blu-ray edition of it so that I could get a better view of it. In the Theater some of the movie sequences seemed odd and it looked like they had been cut or poorly edited. Most of the characters were shallow and 'silly' – except for David and Shaw. With the release of the extras in blu-ray this suspicion of mine proved true. There are many deleted scenes and some of them were not really finished ( you can see major flaws like a cable to hold or drag a character around and some imperfections in the CGI ) thus leading to the conclusion that while they were shooting it they decided not to use a particular scene. But on the other hand, there are at least four scenes which were not used, but were important. If they had decided to use them in the theater release the movie would be better. I am talking about two scenes that were cut from the beginning and two scenes from the end. And there is a fifth scene, that is kind in the middle of the movie, that would have been important too. So a great deal of nice scenes were cut just to be added later in a blu-ray disk of extras, to help sell the Blu-ray. I think the motion picture industry should review this strategy for sometimes it goes wrong. Just like in this movie. And now I discover that there will be a sequel to the movie.. Well, it would be nice to know that beforehand. That's why so many questions are left answered. I guess directors, producers, and the 'big bosses' in the motion industry should rethink their attitudes. Please, do not forget the audience. Part of the movies we watch have a sentimental value. And this sentimental value should never be forgotten in favor of box office income or revenues. Please, don't do that to the audience..",7,0,1,13 October 2012
The Cabin in the Woods," Do not trust the high rating
","If you think This movie is funny, I am sorry: You have a twisted sense of humor. You just want to 'look cool' because you say you 'Understand' the movie and the idea. That's arrogance. If you say this movie is a horror movie, well, you haven't watched horror movies lately. And you haven't watched old classical horror movies enough. Or you get scared way too easily ( suggestion for you: it is just a movie, OK ? It's not real life.. ). If you think it is original, gosh.. what can I do ? It's way closer to a mish-mash rather than something 'Original'. Besides, 'originality' is something questionable, since all movies ( and books ) are related with other things we have seen or read.. So.. Going on: if you think this is a parody, I recommend you to watch 'Shaun of the Dead'. That's a real good parody of terror ( zombies ) movies. And it's funny ! Truly funny, not this S%$T ! This movie won't make you sleep, because you will either leave the theater within 15 minutes or stay in your seat crying and vomiting. Unless you're 'different' as I mentioned before. This movie is awful. Is it meant to be a horror movie ? Fail ! There's no horror in it, except for the poor acting and direction. Is it meant to be a comedy ? Fail again; it's not funny. It's funny only for those who think are better than the rest. Is it meant to be a parody ? Triple fail: The satiric and humorous basis to build a decent parody are not present. The whole concept is too lame and the way the scenarios are divided is too clumsy. The audience can't recognize it is as a parody. There is no way to relate with it. Let's see; this movie was shot in 2009 But released only now in 2012.. Why ? Probably only to benefit from the success of 'Thor' and 'The Avengers'. Chris Hemsworth is in it. But he was not Thor at that time.. What is this movie ? It's a mish-mash of the Truman Show, 13 Ghosts and The Cube with connections with 'Evil Dead', 'Aliens', 'Hell Raiser', 'Skeleton Key', and most zombie movies from John Carpenter. A bag full of references which ended up in nothing. Thank God I didn't watch it in a Theater, because it would be too embarrassing if my friends saw me leaving this movie. I would be the joke till the end of the year.. Oh, and the IMDb ratings are seriously wrong.. How can it have such a high rate ? Only the Ancient Gods know. The boring ones",1,4,10,27 August 2012
