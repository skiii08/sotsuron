Ford v Ferrari," Your fan of old race?. I'll recommend this for you.
","Ford v Ferrari is engaging and giving me thrills when I watch it. I ain't no fans of racing or even about automotive (in this case, about cars). But I really love how the movie flows and make me laugh.",10,1,2,2 February 2020
Avengers: Endgame," ALRIGHT!. TAKE YOUR SEAT, AND WATCH IT SILENTLY.
","Honestly, I like this movie at first-half. But at the middle, I got bored and I play my phone at cinemas (I sit at the top, and my phone brightness is very low, so I'll not disturbing everyone watching it). When it start to the climax of the story, I got hyped and wow, I REALLY LOVE all the superheroes coming and fights the purple guy (I know its Thanos).
But, I'm sure, the ending is perfect to end the Avenger series. Recommend 10/10. But storyline 9/10.",9,1,6,2 February 2020
Toy Story 4," People may love Toy Story 2, but for me, this is the best
","I never laughed so much watching Toy Story sequels. In this fourth sequel, that two bro's is my favourite. Their imagination to solving problem in a 'wow' way, I never think it. At first, I thought they're going to do that, and I'm pleased they didn't do that, because they can destroy the world using their laser eyes.I gonna watch the fifth series if they gonna make it.",10,3,5,2 February 2020
Frozen," Let it go, let it go, haters never bother me anyway
","Oh come on, we know it has catchy song, and that Sweethearted Anna, Silent but Heartmelting Kristoff, and Cute Olaf, and others.
The first I watch this like 'wow', Elsa really got me. But there is one thing I don't like, they didn't really show us how Kristoff will be in Arendelle 'minor' family, he is like only given reward of his opportunity (a medal) and his lost (Yups, his just finished paid installment wagon to bring ice cubes). You know, he fall in love with her (Anna) right, so you'll know he will be part of the Arendelle kingdom.",9,0,3,2 February 2020
The Lion King," I know something gonna go wrong after I watch the trailer.
","And my feelings true. I prefer watching the original than this one. I really appreciate it has nice look and look so real. But, when you remake the original, you should bring the fun, and all emotions, like when you create the original Lion King.
Please, next time, when you create original masterpiece. Think again, you almost make the world mad.
Still recommended if you want to watch, STILL, original is better.",7,0,2,2 February 2020
1917," A War Film That Different From Others
","Different from other war movies, this film is so beautiful that it make my heart melt and my eyes cry. The Wayfaring Stranger song sang beautifully, the emotions that George MacKay and Dean Chapman acts as Schofield and Blake, a huge set to make this film, the soundtracks, made me like I am in the movie and they take my hand to see the adventure of the two soldiers delivering a message.
Of course, Roger Deakins, Sam Mendes, and other crews really put hard effort to create such a masterpiece.
One thing I really hope is I can see what Schofield life after that.",10,1,5,2 February 2020
It Chapter Two," Great Sequel, but why adding something not important too much?
","First, I like their look when they're adult.
Second, love how the story going.
Third, it also got me in jumpscares.
Fourth, I love the ending.But what's wrong?. The movie is TOO LONG, I know adding some flashbacks are good. But, don't add it too much. You're destroying the movie flow. But still, they got great ending and finally they end it at all, right?.",8,0,1,2 February 2020
Parasite," No way I will not watch this.
","Great, Masterpiece.
This movie pictures how human, rich or poor, can do anyhing at any cost to earn what they wanted. But exclusively, this movie shows that even poor people can fool or at this point, 'PARASITE' onto you, rich or poor.
At first-half of the film, I could laugh. But at second-half ('til end), I get the moral lesson of the film.",10,10,14,2 February 2020
