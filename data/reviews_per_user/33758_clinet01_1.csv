","E. T. The Extra Terrestrial is a Steven Spielberg movie about a young boy named Elliot who was played by Henry Thomas, his brother Michael, played by Robert MacNaughton, his sister Gertie, who was played by Drew Barrymore; finding an alien life-form that he had seen earlier. Elliott left Reese's Pieces to lure the alien later known as E.T., who was a major voice make up of animals and recordings of Pat Welsh, back to the house and up into his bedroom.Elliot acts sick the next day in order to stay at home with his new found friend that he later introduces to his brother Michael and his sister Gertie later on. After swearing to keep the alien a secret they help hide him from their mom, Mary; who is played by Dee Wallace. The three children decide to keep the alien, who they soon find out has powers.The alien shows powers healing a plant and levitating different balls when he was trying to communicate where he was from. Using electronic toys he gets Elliot to help him build a telephone that he hopes will help him communicate with his homeland.The adventure begins, the whole theme of this film is about an alien in search of his home and children that want help him out. As their journey continues they ultimately meet up with a scientist who wants to dissect E. T. Determined not to let that happen and after watching E.T. and Elliot nearly die, his siblings and a few of Michael's friends help them escape. E. T. levitates the bike while being pursued by the scientist, he is then able to reach his mother ship where he is able to escape unharmed by humanity and learning that he will always have a friend in Elliot here on Earth.There were a number of special effects that were done on this film such as piecing together the voice for E. T. The lighting in the dark forest and the camera angle during the levitation of the bike scene were outstanding. I remember seeing this film as a child in the drive-in and the effects and lighting were truly what made it a great film.In addition to trying to help the boys the main focus of the theme of this movie on the part of E. T. is that there is no place like home, this, is closely related to the same theme that was seen in another great movie, The Wizard of Oz.My personal opinion of this movie: It was one of the Greatest of All Times.",10,0,1,1 November 2009
