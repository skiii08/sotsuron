The Ring," Absolutely Dismal
","This movie made me demand my money back.  One of the, supposedly, best movies in America left me with a horrible taste in my mouth.  The plot was completely un-believable, the acting was mediocre at best, and the theme was WAY overplayed.  I found nothing even vaguely thrilling or original in this tripe, and I hope that it dies a very fast death so that people with discerning tastes can spare themselves.  1 out of 10.",1,0,2,5 November 2002
