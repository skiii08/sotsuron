Casablanca," Of All the Gin Joints. . . She Had to Walk Into Mine
","The first thing that comes to mind when watching 'Casablanca' is the elegance and simplicity allowing it to be a timeless classic. The movie has a peculiar magic to it, and it's in the richness of its details that the viewer finds them self engrossed. The director's use of foreshadowing makes those aha moments that come later on in the film even more exhilarating, and allow one to wonder if these events are happening within a 24 hour time frame. While it's fascinating to examine and dissect all that went into the making of Casablanca, the greatest pleasure anyone can achieve from this movie comes from simply watching it. There are several events that occur throughout the film that allow us to make generalizations because these little peculiars add up. One of the many events that stick out in my mind is every time the plane to America flies overhead, the refugees look up, their faces longing for escape from Hitler's tyrant rule. We're reminded that old Hollywood was populated with those fleeing from Europe, and the creases in their faces say more than any studio narration used to set the scene. The use of facial expressions sets a common tone displayed throughout the movies. Another form of symbolism one can draw is that Rick represents the image of America during World War II. Rick did not want to get involved in other individuals business much like our war tactics during this time. Towards the end of the film he has no choice but to get involved and make sure Ilsa gets on that plane out of Casablanca, representing the protection of Pearl Harbor. Much like those refugees at the start of the picture, his life experience is written on his face throughout the film. The use of music also plays an important role in building emotion through the movie. Rick's saloon sets an atmosphere of paranoia, exoticism, and liveliness, and then comes romance, in the form of piano player Sam's rendition of 'It Had to Be You.' The paranoia is a result of those individuals trying to obtain traveling papers so they can flee the country, the exotic rush from gambling at this speakeasy which allows for liveliness during a time of despair. The underlying message throughout the film is Rick's building relationship with Ilsa. The story takes place about a year after the Germans invaded France. Ilsa and her husband, Czech freedom fighter Victor Laszlo, wander into Rick's Cafe in Casablanca. Her husband's character feels more like an abstract idea rather than an image of freedom, unlike the letters of transit that allow people safe passage out of Casablanca which are concrete items. The two are on the run from the Nazis, and have come to the American-owned nightspot to lie low. But the German government is on the move, and Laszlo has to act quickly to get the letters of transit he came for, then escape. Little does Ilsa know that the caf√© is run by Rick Blaine, the one true love of her life. When the two see each other, sparks fly, and memories of an enchanted time in Paris come flooding back. Through the use of flashbacks,we find out that Rick and Ilsa had a romantic experience in France and Ilsa leaves Rick with nothing but a broken heart and an extra train ticket. This draws us to conclude that this is a major struggle for Rick and may be the reason why he 'sticks his head out for nobody'. It's not much of a stretch to say that Hollywood doesn't make movies like this any more because the bittersweet ending is almost uncommon in today's society. If Casablanca was produced today, Rick and Ilsa would escape on the plane after avoiding a hail of gunfire from the police. Who knows what would have happened to Victor Laszlo, but he wouldn't have gotten the girl. One of the things that makes Casablanca unique is the way it stays true to itself without giving into crowd-pleasing tactics. And because of this, not despite it, Casablanca has become known as one of the greatest movies ever made.",8,2,4,30 September 2012
High Fidelity," Relatable in More Ways Than One.
","When watching 'High Fidelity' at first it is hard to become interested in such a cynical film about love. From the very opening scene one can sense this overlying doom and depression that will take place through the entire films. John Cusack's character Rob is very harsh in his demeanor and his very first lines tend to stick with you through the rest of the film. 'Music or the misery, which came first?' and 'did I listen to pop music because I was miserable or am I miserable because I listened to pop music.' This is a very alarming statement, many of us tend to find comfort in music which allows for a sense of self soothing. Although at first it was hard to become interested in this movie, afterwords I found it relatable to my life. Many of us have experienced the heartache that Rob is feeling after his break up with his current girlfriend Laura which is why many of us can connect with Rob.The movie is all about Rob reviewing the five women that have broken his heart throughout his whole life. We then go on this self loathing experience of 'always me' mentality that leads us to learn more about this character and his obsession with making 'Top 5 Lists' that are ongoing over the course of the film. Rob blames all of these women for ripping his heart out and stomping on it, when in high school its actually Rob who broke penny's heart. In what one can assume is chemistry class, Rob's lab partner tells him that he had sex with Penny after three days. An explosion happens as a result of the chemical reactants which conveys the anger and frustration and the mixed emotions Rob is feeling inside. After Rob's break up with Laura he decides to go on a journey to talk to his old girlfriends and find out what he did wrong to end their relationship. When he is talking to penny at dinner, Penny tells Rob she was crazy about him, but Rob dumped her; she was tired and emotionally drained when Rob's friend asked her out, she said yes. Later Penny tells Rob that the chemistry partner didn't rape her since she said yes but it wasn't far off from rape. He then compares his breakup with Charlie to how 'some people never got over 'Nam' in the fact that after the break up he was scared for life and never really wanted to date again. He had a traumatic experience that sticks with him and changes his views and ideas on the world. Throughout his relationship with Charlie, Rob is very hard on himself and doesn't think he is good enough to be with a girl like her, which many of us can relate in our dating experiences. We all have our ideal dream girl or guy and once we end up with a person who meets all of our need we don't think we are equal enough to be with them which causes us to doubt our every move we make.Which brings us to his current situation working at his record store, Championship Vinyl. His record store is a symbol of how he is stuck in a rut and has been for so long and how he doesn't really want to change. The record store just displays further gloom that is overcasting Rob's life, which is ironic because the shop is vibrant inside. At his used record store two eccentric employees spend their time making up Top Five lists and poking fun of the occasional customers that the store draws. Two shoplifting teens are the burden of their existence, we later find out that the teens just want to make music and end up making a mix tape and leaving it at the store. Cusack's character becomes inspired by their song and welcomes a turning point in the film when he gives the teens a record label and starts to promote their band at a night club. After the major turning point in the movie store is getting busier, the workers are no longer making a mockery of the customers playing more audience appropriate music also.Cusack's direct address to the camera and his self-reflective narration of his failed relationships tends to become boring and allows for a loss of interest in the film until the major turning point in the record store. Although it seems like even when everything is going his way ( him and Laura got back together, he has a record label, is making a return as a DJ... etc) and he still seems unhappy with his life, and makes the viewer wonder if he will truly ever be satisfied.",6,0,2,1 October 2012
