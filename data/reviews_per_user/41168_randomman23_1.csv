National Treasure: Book of Secrets," Cheese-fest
","I cannot believe I actually spent money on this movie. I think I rolled my eyes about a thousand times. They even made Helen Mirren come across as an average actress. I remember one of her lines was meant to be comedic but no one in the entire theater laughed. I did enjoy the prequel but they decided to multiply the dose of cheese to an unspeakable amount. I did go in with an open mind, ready for an entertaining mindless popcorn flick... but I immediately found out that was way too high of an expectation. The only bright spot about it was Justin Bartha (Riley), who was quite funny. I hate to say that this was one of the worst movies I have seen in a very long time. I highly recommend NOT seeing it.",1,9,19,27 December 2007
