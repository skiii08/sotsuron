Ghost," Just plain dire...
","Maybe I'm a heartless soul but I hated the combination of sickly slush and glamour that is Ghost. I'd rather spend an evening shelling peas. The problem with describing this film is where to start.Maybe wooden acting and over sentimentalised script. Or complete lack of any sense of dramatic realism. Or poor direction and obvious plot progression.I've enjoyed romantic films before, but I'd recommend settling down to an old black and white movie, or anything in preference to this.1/10.",1,14,37,10 July 2000
