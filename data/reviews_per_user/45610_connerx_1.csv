The Expendables 2," First view, not great but destined to be a cult classic of my generation, for the cast alone, as it was meant to be.
","To sum up my experience with the movies I & II, I had no clue about I but for that I am a knife collector, and saw the knife in a catalog, then I looked up the movie. I was floored by the cast, and by that time, they were making this one, II. I waited in great expectation, and was even more floored by the cast. Every icon of action of my generation, it is unreal. There's an up and a down, of course. Every hero (or anti-hero) has his lines, but there is no STAR. Which is perfect, and intentional. Every nuance of the movie is a serious back-take to the roles that were, yet set in a fun 'let's have a beer and watch' setting. There are no lines to be saved from this one, just very good chuckles at the cross-reference lines they make to each other both in and out of character. (As in, to each other's actor's previous movies).It's not filmed as nicely or cohesively as the previous I movie, but the special effects certainly were what was wanted by this audience. CGI or not, but I suppose that's really what shooting people really looks like. I imagine somebody next will say, 'It will better in III if they have zombies!'All and all, I'd rate this as not a classic, but a cult classic to be, along the lines of Highlander and The Crow. To compare it to a TV show, it would have to be a classic, because of the cast that you're 'used to', like MASH or Star Trek.I rated it a 7 for it's filming/continuity. I'd really give it an 8 if your a fan of the genre, and a 9 if your a geek like me.",7,1,3,27 August 2012
