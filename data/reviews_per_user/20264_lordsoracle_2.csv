Hereditary," What a Shocker - A full 10 from me!
","I rarely comment on horrors beyond the stars but this one deserves my unreserved 10/10! Every thing about this movie meets the mark. The scoring, the atmosphere and the story - wow! That is one heck of a twister. I never saw the story head where it did, and the ending... that ending leaves me shocked and stunned!Rarely do we see horrors this good. You get one in 20 crappy depressing clitche ridden movies and then comes along a genre defining movie like this one. I wholly recommend you watch this.",10,2,5,3 February 2019
Downfall," One of the Best WWII Dramas I have Watched
","I am just from watching this film, and I must say the realism, the acting, the portrayal of those imagined last days of Hitler in his bunker just before the Red Army overrun Berlin is remarkable.I was especially moved by the fact that this movie has been critically hailed for staying as true to the 'facts' as possible. Off course all movies will have key details changed for dramatic purposes, but the director and writer tried as much as possible to remain factual in all portrayals here.The performance by Bruno Gantz playing as Adolf Hitler was remarkable down to even his looks. I am surprised this movie did not get a nod from the Oscar people or perhaps it did and I am not aware. I only learned of this film just last week as it was reviewed on someone's list and being the history buff I am, wanted to verify for myself.The performances from the supporting cast is also impeccable, the actors that play Goebbels, his wife, Himmler, Eva Braun, several of the generals and even the main character that plays Jungl is spectacular and nothing short of award winning (IMHO). It is amazing how such a gem can be missed by mainstream movie buffs like me.Bottom line, watch this movie, you wont regret it. If you dont mind reading subtitles when watching (as it all in German), then this is a must watch on your list. For me, this film is certainly at the same level as Schindler's List, A Beautiful Life and other such noteworthy World War II Dramas.",10,0,1,12 August 2018
