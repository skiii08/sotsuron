Deja Vu," Gets an award for originality
","In Deja Vu, Denzel Washington is an ATF agent how wisely investigates a bombing, killing five hundred people on a ferry. However, there is an oddity in the case. A woman washes up to shore an hour before the boat explodes. How could this be? The suspense in this story is unlike anything I've ever seen or experienced. The action sequences are unique as well. For instance a one of a kind car chase where Denzel chases a car from 4 days earlier. (You'll understand when you see the movie) Speaking of which the plot isn't to difficult to understand. The suspense is good enough to be kind of creepy at times and the action is exhilarating. This movie is certainly worth it.",8,1,2,8 December 2006
Empire of the Sun," Powerful
","Empire of the Sun doesn't really fall under the category of action-packed war film. Instead it follows just one boy who is almost forced to grow up during the Japanese takeover of Shanghai in World War II. Jim, played by a very young Christian Bale, lives happily with his aristocratic parents, is a very spoiled boy and has huge interest in aviation. He's separated from his parents during a Japanese take over in an area of Shanghai that was protected by some sort of diplomatic immunity. What allowed the take over to happen was the declaration of the war from Japan to the US. Jim scared and alone has no idea what's to become of him. He meets with a couple of American merchant seaman Basie (John Malkovich) and Frank (Joe Pantoliano). Basie isn't necessarily selfish, but he does what he must do to survive, very cynical. They both end up in a Japanese prison camp and that's where they stay during the war. So after a brief synopsis, what I can say about this film is that it's 'powerful' It's a story of survival and growing up for Jim and it has some powerful and genuinely sad moments that all come with war. Again this movie is not an action film it is very dramatic and intense. It may take more than once to watch to fully understand it, but when you do the feeling of this film will be worth it.",9,3,7,15 August 2006
Ghost Rider," I'm not disappointed
","It was a great day to unwind Friday night and seeing Ghost Rider was just the thing I needed. Nicholas Cage playing Johnny Blaze did a great addition to Ghost Rider's character with his eccentric style. The movie doesn't follow the comics very much, but we don't want the whole movie to take place in hell. Now the fact that Johnny has sold his soul to the devil to be a ghost rider now that's accurate and it gives the movie plenty of motivation. Pretty soon Blackheart and his minions want to get in Johnny's position of power and they want a contract of one thousand souls. Eva Mendes had great perkiness and she was also delightful to see. The movie is loads of fun with great action, and plenty of intentional laughs. You'll have a good time.",8,2,3,17 February 2007
Rudy," A movie that will lift the spirits of a dreamer.
","'The problem with dreamers is that they usually aren't doers' Is a quote I found to be an unfortunate truth at times. However Rudy has shown that a young man with a troubled life can overcome all odds and fulfill dreams that are worth a lifetime of memories and pride. Even when times were dark for Rudy he refused to give in which I found to be beautiful. Every time I watch this movie I feel I can relate, and if a man or woman works hard they can fulfill any dream no matter how impossible it seems. Every time I watch this film I feel a sudden lift in my spirits and tears of joy run down my face. Whether in times of happiness or darkness, 'Rudy' is a movie that will touch your soul.",10,1,1,1 May 2006
