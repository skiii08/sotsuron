Come and See," Great Cautionary Movie about war and what it is
",I think this movie brings to the viewers attention the destruction of war on a civilization. That war only brings with it death and the abuse of power. For example the scene where they burn the people in the house unless they leave their children behind is just cruel punishment that no one deserves. That there is never a need for war or violence.That many innocent people die only because someone is willing to follow orders. This is shown when some of the captured soldiers are told to burn them and two men say 'they forced us to'. In reality no one forced you to pick up a weapon and kill you choose to. Just as others choose to die with their families rather then join in on pure evil.I think it is a real example of what war is and not what movies in todays world perceive as. It a grim and dark world that the youth should be pointed away from and not encouraged to join. A gun and saying you killed the enemy doest not make you a man.,9,1,1,5 June 2012
