The Blair Witch Project," The Bottom Line
","What kind of movie-goer am I? I'll tell you. I go to the bargain matinee. Saturday Night Live better do a sketch about this movie. It's already reached cult status. Anyway, I'm the kind of movie-goer who decides, in that moment when getting up out of my seat at the end, after watching for the ENTIRE 82 minutes, whether or not I got my money's worth.I had visited the movie's official web site beforehand. I even heard word-of-mouth about the flick from people who had seen the Sci-Fi Channel's coverage on it. I knew it wasn't true. I knew that this movie created a buzz at Sundance, and in movie circles in print and online. I realize that these neophyte filmakers wanted to produce a successful movie. I don't know if they actually think this work is any more than performance art, or if they think it's a milestone in cinematic expression. By any standards, one that puts the asses in the seats to the tune of over $36M in less than a week of its nationwide release, especially when it cost only $25K or $60K to make, (depending on what article is correct) qualifies it as a HUGE success. I only wish that it had been a better movie. I can't help but feel I've been taken by the gimmick. The hype is rarely ever matched by the product, is it? It wasn't supposed to be a real movie was it? Just 'documentary footage' that was found and put together. That would cover a multitude of cinematic sins, wouldn't it? Doesn't hurt to cover your bases, does it? It could even be bad, huh?Ingenious as it is, the marketing of this production-on-a-shoestring delivers a first effort that left me unsatisfied. I agree that there were a few great moments that were genuinely creepy, but they were separated by far too much tedious repetition included for the sake of 'realism.' The fighting, yelling, and screaming at each other came quite quickly, it seems, for a movie that went so slowly. After only a couple days in the woods they mentally 'fell apart.' The 'improvised acting' suffered a bit there. The things that went bump in the night promised something more that never came. The distant unknown sounds and voices were as scary as it got, and could have led to something else, but never really did, beyond the blurry images inside the house, maybe. The ending was actually a relief. It finally put an end to the crying, the yelling, the shaking camera, and the almost endless asking, 'What was that??!!!'  We never do find out, and have to figure it must've been the wicked witch of Blair. It WAS something. Right?  I have to laugh at the people who say they're the only one who 'got' the movie. Many people are reading things into this movie's ending, but if it makes you feel better...You can discuss whether or not the actors are hotties, thanks to the previous 'Scream' and '...Last Summer' movies, and talk about the ticket sales and statistics, but why not talk about what makes some movies really good, others really great, and some a waste of time. I can't say this one was a waste. You should see what the fuss and hype is all about, but don't expect a classic. There are people risking fortunes every day who think they know what would make a good movie. These particular guys accomplished something imaginative that will certainly be imitated. They tried to scare us without using a big bank roll, special effects, gore, monster costumes, puppets, guns, explosions, or gratuitous nudity, sex and violence. That alone is a novel idea. They used sticks and stones and sounds and darkness. I consider that an extremely brave approach when you're aiming at the cynical, computer-literate, self-absorbed, seen-it-all, mostly 17-34 year old, MTV Generation movie audience member who just forked over $4.25 to $9.00 per person and said, 'Okay, now scare me.' Hey, if I could make a better movie I would. I'm only speaking from an actor's perspective, and as a person who likes movies. They're the ones who had the guts to turn a few good ideas into millions at the box office, not me. I'm the kind of movie-goer who is hopeful. Since Eduardo Sanchez and Daniel Myrick will have a bigger budget to work with on their next project, which they claim will be a wacky comedy, I hope that it will do a much better job at making me laugh than The Blair Witch Project did at scaring me. It would be nice to get my money's worth. I wonder if they need any more unknown actors...Wait a minute... did you hear something? What was that???!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",2,0,2,5 August 1999

Erin Brockovich," Ride that vehicle, girl.
","This is another movie for all the really big Julia Roberts fans. Hey, I like her as much as the next guy. She's easy on the eyes, and never plays dumb. Girls like her, guys like her, and so do parents. Seems like she hasn't got an enemy in the world. We love her. We root for her. We're on her side. We have to get our Julia fix three or four times every twelve months to get through our movie-watching year. Everything you could want in one of her pictures is played for all it's worth in Erin Brockovich.  It's the kind of movie that defines the term `star vehicle.' Not only is she the main character, but she's in every single scene, and everybody else is just there to make her look good. This is the way to market your star-power and rake it in at the box office... again.It's based on a true story, if you haven't heard, and is about a plucky, twice divorced, mother of three, who dresses like a hooker, but manages to talk her way into a job working for a lawyer, played perfectly by Albert Finney. I guess she figures all women would dress slutty if they looked as good as she does. At work, she finds out there's more to one of his neglected pro bono cases than first thought, and they eventually file suit against a big California power company for poisoning the water in a rural community with hexevalent chromium and trying to get away with it. With no law degree or training, she works very hard and uses her `charms' ('They're called boobs, Ed.') and `people skills' to fight for what's right. She's bitchy to almost everybody (`Bite me, Krispy Kreme!') except the people of the town, to whom she's as sweet as can be. George, played admirably by Aaron Eckhart, is her only romantic interest (next door neighbor/babysitter/biker dude boyfriend) who gets the good and bad of both sides of her personality. The real Erin B. has a cameo role as a waitress.There's talk about Julia being considered for another Academy Award nomination because of this movie. I don't know, that's a possibility, but I'd rather see her actually win an Oscar in a more complete film. I'm sure she has her pick of scripts. I'd like to someday see her in a gritty human drama where she doesn't care what she looks like and just acts her buns off. I think she can do it. The director, Steven Soderberg, concentrated so much on keeping the camera on her and the wardrobe, that something about the rest of it didn't hold up.  I wonder which is better, getting a 20 million dollar paycheck for one movie, or getting an Oscar. That's something most of us will never know. I did enjoy much of the movie, maybe a little more than when I saw her play herself in Notting Hill. I  never felt it was a waste of time or money. And I did get my Julia fix, and that's the main thing. E-mail and comments are welcome.",Null,0,0,2 June 2000
The Elephant Man," If You Like Movies About Humanity
","I saw this film on video in the summer of 1985. Anthony Hopkins had done many things, mostly in Britain, but I remembered 'The Bounty'(1984 with Mel Gibson) and 'Peter and Paul'(1981 TV) and knew about 'Magic' (1978) and 'The Hunchback of Notre Dame'(1982 TV). He was not yet a big star, but you'd never know it from his high calibre work. He gives one of his best performances of his distinguished career in 'The Elephant Man,' regardless of his later Oscar-winning roles.David Lynch seemed to be making a movie about people, rather than just a strange story (as in almost everything else he's done before or since). Shooting it in black and white gave it both an odd feeling of authenticity, and a surreal artistic look. These are words and worlds Lynch is famous for.The movie is based on the play by Bernard Pomerance, which remains one of the most moving pieces of genuine theater there has ever been. Since the story of John Merrick is mostly true, with some dramatic license added, of course, it affects us even more. We can't imagine having to live a life with such deformity. We can't imagine how he did it. The film moves us by showing that there was a real human being much like ourselves in the body of a side show freak.In the play, the title character is performed without the aid of make up. Slides are shown of what he actually looked like, and we use our imaginations from there. In this movie, John Hurt is in full make up and prosthetics which is eventually shown on screen. Until then, we only see the other actors' reactions to his looks, which builds tension and piques our curiosity. Amazingly, both actors have an incredible task: Play a freak in human form, and to play a man in freakish form. Each calls for an actor of immense talent. You will not be disappointed.",Null,1,1,6 August 1999

Meet Joe Black," Don't meet him
","This could have been a really good film if there had been some consistency with the character of Death. He is powerful and all-knowing when need be, and totally clueless the rest of the time. Death's work is to end every human life at their appointed time, but he has no idea what he's ending. So, for reasons unknown he has the time and ability to find out. Pitt is handsome and charming as a doomed young man in a coffee shop, and handsome, boring and charmless as Death. Hopkins can do great work even in a flawed film. Forlani is believable and beautiful, despite looking as though she is about to fall asleep every five to ten minutes. Not a good quality for a character in a nearly three hour movie. Harden and Tambor (both wonderful talents long before Larry Sanders existed) do some top-quality film work. The message seems to be that family is most important, lots and lots of money is really good, and that death and taxes are still inevitable. I think they also ask the cinematic question, 'Just how long can we get away with keeping the camera focused on a well-groomed Brad Pitt in total silence?'",1,55,101,2 June 2000

Mission: Impossible II," Tommy's Next Big Paycheck
","The Main Thing by nicardo@bigfoot.com Review of Mission: Impossible-2The most impossible mission in Hollywood, if you choose to accept it, is very clear. There seems to be no way, even spending many millions of dollars, to create an action/adventure movie that is actually believable. Can't seem to be done. I know movies are fiction, but how come when they push that envelope, it ends up bursting at the seams? Do they think we won't go see it unless it's a comic book on celluloid? Super-humans with powers far above those of mortal men battle brains and brawn for the safety of mankind. Give me a break. One of the things you have to admire about the old TV series was that no matter how difficult the situation or how impossible the odds, the IM Force always stayed within the bounds of reason. They used brains, skill and luck to accomplish their goal, often with last second timing, but they never caused this viewer to remark, `Uh, yeah, right...'This movie not only provokes such comments, it seems to encourage them. `You think that was impossible? Watch this!' Scene after scene we get subjected to things that would not and could not ever happen. Who asked them to take the title so literally??? Yeah, it's escapism. Just suspend your disbelief and sit back and `enjoy' if you can.  Tom Cruise, actor/producer had to make a sequel to the confusing previous effort because it made more money than any movie he's ever done. He must have been in a hurry, too. He replays Ethan Hunt the super spy, and master of disguise, and master of weapons, and hand-to-hand combat, and computers, and motorcycles, and mountain-climbing, and master figuring out everything the bad guy is going to do before he does it. The team? He only needs a couple of guys in the background (Ving Rhames and John Polson) and one female to serve as bait (Thandie Newton) in order to thwart the plans of a vicious ex-agent (Dougray Scott) his right hand man (Richard Roxburgh), and AN ARMY of henchmen.  Newton's character is also the ex-girlfriend of the bad guy. Clever, huh? (yawn) She's some kind of professional thief. Just perfect for a save-the-world-type mission, huh? Since Ethan doesn't get out much, and most of the women he meets end up dead before the last reel, he quickly falls in LOVE with Nyah (Newton). Maybe because it's rated PG-13, but does this falling in love so quickly bother anybody besides me? I saw the same thing happen in `The World is Not Enough,' where Pierce Brosnan fell for Sophie Marceau in a matter of minutes. Then later, he falls for Denise Richards in a matter of seconds. Lust? Okay. Happily Ever After? Please...If you want senseless, pointless, violent, comic book style action, then this is your cup of TNT. Cruise joins Arnold and Bruce in the realm of action, noise and indestructibility, seeking only big box office totals, rather than excellent, intelligent, admirable film-making. Just as long as you know what you're in for. That's the main thing. Comments and e-mail welcome.",Null,0,0,4 July 2000
Gladiator," As the Crowe Flies
","Okay, I haven't seen a gladiator movie in a long time, but, I thought they were all rather simplistic. Sword and sandals epics, theyÕre called. Togas and tigers. Chariots and fire. Arenas and amphitheaters. Columns and colosseums. The new movie, Gladiator, is chance to see all that stuff. That was about what I expected. Not a day at the beach.You have to remember the genre. The filming expenses became greater than the box office totals, so, they havenÕt made this kind of movie in almost 40 years. The subject matter is violence. Got that? A gladiator fights to the death. Therefore, the main course here is bloody, hand-to-hand combat, served with war, duty, ambition, murder, injustice, betrayal, and revenge, with small side orders of politics and philosophy. And for dessert, more blood and death. A friendly word of advice? DonÕt sit in the first two rows. By todayÕs standards, it has to come out different than whatÕs been done before. It comes out dark, somber, dour, gloomy, and computer-generated. Yeah, I really miss those light-hearted films about ancient Romans and barbarians, too, but what do you think it was really like? I know I wouldn't want to live back then. Neither would Kirk Douglas, Charleton Heston, nor the late Victor Mature, nor the late Steve Reeves, I'm guessing.This movie is getting mixed reviews. I suppose it could have been better in some ways, but that really depends on what youÕre looking for. ItÕs a tragedy, not Òthe feel good movie of the summer.Ó Do some people just not get that? This may be the reason for the conflicting opinions. It doesnÕt matter if you know the story ahead of time. Just donÕt expect to be uplifted and spiritually renewed. All I expected was good acting and some entertainment value. I spent $4.50 at a 1:30 p.m. matinee, and can say I was entertained at times, and certainly didn't feel it was a waste of time and money. Not at all. The ones who get short-changed are women. Their roles in these kinds of movies are nearly always dumb. No exception here.Russell Crowe is always good. He is the movie. If I didn't know any better, I could have sworn that at times he sounded exactly like Mel Gibson, especially in a rare split second when a line of dialogue was delivered with his back is to the camera. Must be the Aussie influence. His commitment to his work, both physically and mentally, is amazing to watch. We have far too few, and can never have too many actors like that. Somebody said theyÕd pay money to watch him stand around and drink beer. What greater compliment is there?Somebody has to play the bad guy. Joaquin Phoenix has the perfect look for the part, and seems committed, but ends up looking like heÕs in over his head. Okay, he got this acting job to do a movie with none other than Crowe, Oliver Reed and Richard Harris. That might be a bit intimidating, no? It would be hard for most of us not to look like we suck sharing the screen with those guys. ItÕs a part for a young Roddy McDowall type, and Phoenix did provided the insipid total psychopath needed, but nobody in this movie was even allowed to have any fun.The late Oliver ReedÕs farewell performance was excellent. I loved him in the Musketeers movies of the 70's, and was glad to see him working until the end. ThatÕs one way to go, isnÕt it?I thought the special effects were rather seamless, though some of the landscapes do look like gorgeous computer paintings. Though no doubt it makes Rome look better than it was, I thought it strange that I never saw an aqueduct, nor any sunshine. I couldn't tell that England wasn't Germania, and Malta, where a lot of this was shot, is really one awesome-looking place. As far as the action, I noticed from the first battle scene that they had so many fast cuts and too-close close-ups, and so much shaky camera crap that it was mission impossible to actually follow what was happening physical-action-wise from moment to moment. That bothered me, but I doubt they wanted to be too graphic too soon, and figured they first wanted to give a basic feel for the violence, rather than glory in the bloody details. Maybe it was a ratings thing, too. It wasn't quite as guarded later on, though still sometimes challenging to watch.This a must-see, even if itÕs just to make up your own mind about the highest-grossing movie of last weekend.

High Fidelity," Not a Comedy
","The Main Thing by nicardo@bigfoot.com Review of High Fidelity Do I watch movies because I'm miserable, or am I miserable because I watch movies? At the beginning of High Fidelity, the main character poses the same question about his passion for music. `Do I listen to records because I'm miserable, or am I miserable because I listen to records?' he asks, but it's a rhetorical question. Since Rob Gordon (John Cusack) owns a vintage record store, he listens because he has to, it's what he does, it's part of him. He has no choice, really. Anyway, what he does is only the backdrop here. It's not really about his job. It's about a regular guy attempting to figure out if he wants to grow up and accept change and responsibility. Go see it if you want to see someone, who may be more screwed up than yourself trying to get a grip.As far as we're concerned, what he should have asked was, `Do I get into relationships because I'm miserable, or am I miserable because I get into relationships?' That is actually what the rest of the story is about. His current live-in girlfriend is Laura (Iben Hjejle). She's gorgeous, smart and ambitious. Well, she just moved out, so he digs up memories of his personal top five break-ups of all time, and tries to figure out what the hell went wrong. That's right. Rather than focus just on his present relationship, he delves into the past and looks up these old girlfriends to find out where they are now in order to feel better about himself. Why do we care? Well, it's John Cusack. Isn't he good? And because Rob has a very big... record collection. He owns a record store. You'd go there, right? And because he's `hip.' How do we know? Well, he knows way more about records than you ever will. He loves records. He would like to have been a reporter for Rolling Stone magazine. He doesn't understand about love and commitment, but he listens to music.When I saw it, I was distracted for a couple of hours, saw some decent acting here and there, but felt that if this movie were a song, they were singing at me, rather than to me. It's a situation where there was a good novel (by Nick Hornby) that had trouble being made into a good movie. Cusack is very talented. Even with all his romantic comedy film experience, I'm not sure that his helping to write the screenplay adaptation made it funnier. This is not really a comedy. That's okay, but I don't like to be mislead. There are a few funny scenes, only not enough of them. Like when Rob has a major confrontation with his rival for Laura's affections, Ian (Tim Robbins), he plays the scene several times in his head. We're not sure which scene is real until they end. That's the kind of quirky thing that works in a movie. The replay button in our mind that we wish we had in life. Since music groups, songs, albums, liner notes and lyrics are the most important things in their lives, Rob's two employees in the record shop (Jack Black and Todd Louiso) are either funny, cruel, pathetic, or all three, depending on the scene and your personal point of view. Lisa Bonet plays a local struggling night club singer and recording artist. It's a role that must have been more interesting when the story was set in London rather than Chicago. She's really just an object of Rob's lust.Cusack spends a lot of time mulling things over and talking directly to the camera explaining to us his confusion. I can see where a book can be like that, but, I felt like he often held things up rather than moved them along. When exactly do we get caught up with the history lesson and get on with the story? So, what's the point? We just look at him suffer because she walked out and he doesn't know why. Well, it's obvious from the start. There are big questions every man has to face at some point in his life. Are you serious about your woman or what? Is she the one, or are you just spinning your wheels and using her? Who do you want, and what kind of person do you want to be? That's the main thing. E-mail and comments are welcome.",Null,0,0,2 June 2000
