United 93," In Honor of our brave citizens who took a stand against tyranny
","Words can not explain the honor of those ordinary citizens displayed on that terrible September day in 2001. They were ordinary people going to see families, working, and simply living out their lives. With heroes of Beemer, Glick, Burnett, and others showed that ordinary people can conquer over terrorism. The passengers of this doomed flight sacrificed their lives to ensure that the U.S. Capitol was safe. The scenes of the chaos in the flight centers, military, and lack of communication really showed that we were dragged into a new type of war, the War on Terrorism. I would recommend to see this movie and you will be glued to your seat, this was a excellent honor and respect to the people that lost their lives on September 11, 2001.",10,14,32,28 April 2006
