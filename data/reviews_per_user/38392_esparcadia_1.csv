Blade Runner 2049," Still exciting and still waiting for more
","Blade Runner is a seminal ageless work of art. Its languishing slowness and quiet allow time for viewers to make connections and reflect on ageless themes...though for most it took several viewings. So what about BR 2049? Does it compare favorably to the first? Yes yes yes. We are treated to the mystery of another Deckard - is he fully human or a replicant? By 2049 we find out (we think) that he is and so is his son agent K or Joe...or maybe not? Only Eldon Tyrell knows and A 'son' kills him in direct contrast to Joe who sacrifices himself to the cause and Deckard his dad. This film just like its precursor must be seen several times or more to even attempt an understanding. As an adaptive work from its source by P. Dick, Villeneuve captures the post apocalyptic malaise far better than even Scott. The characters and technology fascinate. The character of Luv - the monomaniacal slave to Wallace - has to be one of the most evil in film history. Bravo to Luv's monstrous echoing of Batty's sincere attempt at humanity. But then again Niander Wallace is human in name only. BR 2049 is a grand glorious film with only a few missteps along the way...",9,1,10,28 April 2019
