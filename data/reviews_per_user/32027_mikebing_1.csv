Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," A must see for those easily offended, fodder for the rest of us
","Just got back from Borat, what a hoot!! Combine Animal House, Candid Camera, Dumb and Dumber, SNL, Jackass, and every irreverent movie and current reality TV and nothing comes close. Anyone who is easily offended by sexism, racism, anti-semitism, gay sex, male nudity, incest, masturbation, anti-americanism, neo-con bashing, and Christian-fundamentalist bashing, my advice: a must see on a Saturday nite, absolve yourself the next day. The rest of us can see this any nite, chuckle for days, AND, look forward to the DVD with the outtakes and inside jokes.Finally, Borat ultimately mocks the audience as he eventually hits upon the most common states of universal human hypocrisy. No one leaves the theatre un-offended on some level.",9,3,7,25 November 2006
