The Blair Witch Project," The worst cheapest film I've ever seen!
","I almost fell asleep during most parts of the film... I hard to struggle hard to continue watching, waiting for some action or something that really made me feel thrilled... but nothing... until the end of the film: just 5 minutes before it finished, I felt it started to have some good scary action... but with that ridiculous end, I only wanted to have my money back!",1,1,3,3 December 1999
