The Avengers," Fun, action-packed, stunning movie
","This movie makes any superhero nerd shake with excitement. To see your childhood memories come to life is great. The CGI is pretty good. There are some very funny moments in the film (most of which comes from Robert Downey Jr) Whenever there is action you can clearly tell whats happening and you can really enjoy it. Then when the final battle happens and ends it made me just feel good. You see six heroes just work together and it just pleases you. The two after credits scenes are also enjoyable. With Joss Whedon setting up Thanos years from 2012. And the shwarma scene which is just funny. It is my third favorite Marvel movie, behind Guardians of the Galaxy and Infinity War.",9,1,2,10 November 2018
Avengers: Endgame," I don't know how people hate this
",The story starts out strange but in the end you realize that the entire film was worth it. Everyone goes through their changes. Everyone's arcs are completed.Tony gets to have a daughter and finally makes the true sacrifice. Steve finally gets his dance with Peggy. Thor gets to be on his own because he realizes he is not a leader. Bruce gets to fix the problems he has with Hulk finally at peace. So on and so forth.But the final battle is basically every fans dream. Big battles that go on and its just amazing. Cap gets Thor's hammer in worthiness. Tony finally has the ultimate sacrifice. Everyone comes back to life. And of course this will go down as one of the greatest movie lines ever 'Avengers...Assemble.' Pure awesomeness.,9,1,3,27 April 2019
Avengers: Infinity War," Awesome Team-Up movie
","What happens when your favorite heroes from all the MCU movies come together? Answer: Greatness. This movie has great action, comedy, and even some very sad moments. It shouldn't work but it does. You have a great villain who is empathetic, dangerous, and respectful. You've got Star-Lord, Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, Gamora, Spider-man, Rocket, Drax, Black Widow, Vision, Groot, Black Panther and so many other characters. Everyone has a good joke. Some of the scenes will even bring tears to the younger or more sensitive viewers. This movie's ending is awesome, yet it still leaves you wanting for more. If you love any of these heroes your in luck. You must watch the movie for it is absolutely awesome.",10,1,2,18 September 2018
Guardians of the Galaxy," I loved it
","The special effects, comedy, acting, and emotion was felt and loved. I laughed a lot. I loved the effects because they were dazzling. The acting was really good especially from Bradley Cooper and Chris Pratt. But Zoe Saldana and Dave Bautista were good. I can't really say much for Vin Diesel because he only says five words. But Groot did make me feel sad. I can't believe a tree saying 'We are Groot.' gets me emotional but it does. So, good job! People complained about the plot but that was the main thing of it. The main thing your supposed to see is the theme about family. How your friends can be your family. The villain was weak but once again the film isn't centered around him. He's just there to move things forward. The beginning at ending were very emotional and I didn't cry at the end (I don't ever cry during movies) but it did make eyes teary. I didn't cry, but my eyes did water and that's good enough for me. So overall this film was great and its my second favorite Marvel movie behind Infinity War. (I'm a big fan of team-up superhero movies).",9,0,0,8 November 2018
Logan," Bloody, emotional, action-packed great movie
","This movie is just so bloody and I like it. Logan truly is like his comic counter part. The way he kills people is so brutal and I love it! This is a beaten down hero who has nothing to do. You see he only looks out for himself at the beginning and it makes him more human. Then Laura is just as brutal as him.Now, the deaths. They aren't meant to be heroic or anything. This is real life. Some people don't die heroic deaths. They just...die. Like Xavier. He was stabbed. Nothing he sacrificed himself for. But what made it emotional is the fact that he has been playing in these movies for so long. And the talk he gave to Logan's clone before he was killed. That was so emotional how he opened himself up...and Logan didn't hear it and Xavier got murdered. Then Logan's death was actually heroic and sad like Xavier's. Then the action. It is spectacular to see a Logan being weak and unable to fight most of the movie finally go full animal and just murder people at the end. If you feel close to these characters then you will probably cry. Or at least get pretty emotional. But I highly recommend it.",10,2,3,11 November 2018
Black Panther," Its okay.
","Now, being a big fan of Marvel I usually give my Marvel movies sevens or eights. A few nines and one ten. But this movie. Its CGI was garbage *cough* war rhino *cough*. The two characters fighting each-other had the same powers (like we haven't seen that 1,000 times). I knew immediately that T'Challa would be fighting someone with revenge against him. Another take over the world scenario. Oh yeah, and political stuff! Like we don't see people talking about how racist white people are all the time. It gets really annoying. Why couldn't a black director for ONCE not make it about black people and just not teach anyone about political problems? Well whatever. I don't see how this movie can
be nominated for Best Picture at the Oscars. There were some good parts though. I liked Killmonger until he got too political. Shuri was pretty funny. Action was okay. But this ain't no good solo movie like Iron Man or Captain America: The Winter Soldier or Logan. In fact, I don't want people to even COMPARE it to Logan. Logan is much better. Well, whatever. It okay.",7,1,2,12 November 2018
