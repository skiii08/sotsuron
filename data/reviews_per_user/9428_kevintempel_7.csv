The Avengers," Best ever!
","Now this is a movie that I will recommend to anyone. It is awesome!' I been two times to see it in 3D already. It have cost me the price of $42 already (only for the tickets). But it was worth every penny spent, and for the coca-cola and popcorn I would say I have spent about $55 only on the avengers! But I am guessing for a The Avenger II and III etc. Because with Robert Downey Jr. as Iron Man it is a must see. And waiting for the wolverine to come into The Avengers, I saw Iron Man/Tony Stark in the wolverine movie, so there must be another coming with the wolverine also joining the avengers. And is the biggest villain we see in the end Thanos? it must be... It is for me only Thanos and Loki that are the interesting villains. It was also a time where JLA and Avengers met together and fought villains. But not all JLA and Avengers characters are great. The best ones we would as audience see together in a battle for good I feel is: Superman, Batman, Spiderman, The Wolverine, Captain America, The Hulk, Thor and the Daredevil. Of the villains there are only some I can think of that would be supercool in a fight against evil, the evilest of them all: Doomsday, Thanos, Loki, Luthor and Zod.I am waiting and looking forward to the next round!10/10 on IMDb.com - this movie is one of the greatest action/adventure movies I ever seen. I'll buy the blu-ray when that gets out, all of them...",10,1,5,4 May 2012
Cars 2," violence is that all you got
","I loved Cars. And was looking forward to Cars 2. but then I saw the trailer, and I saw the film with my son who is 5 years old. And I say to the makers of this piece of crap:If the only thing you can make is violence and bombs and think that is the moral and corruption of young children's minds we want you better hang up your hat and move to another industry.Why is all the cartoons now a days about blowing the most up, shooting and killing. I mean do you not have any better imagination than that?Cars 2 could have followed the story of Cars. A story of hope and dreams. But no..you wanted bombs and grenades.So this movie cars 2 are banned at our home, my other kids will not see it, and it is not recommended for any kids younger than 13.Can Disney make the beautiful children films they are known for? I mean films of love, hope, happiness, magic etc. That is what our kids want. I am really thinking of stopping all my kid channels on TV Disney, Disney XD, Cartoon network, Nick...etc. Why you ask? well because all the programs are about bombs, violence, fighting, shooting, killing...there are no longer a good moral to the stories, it is about blowing up as much as possible in the least amount of time. So why should I degrade my kids minds with this violence?parents should ask themselves: what future do we want for our kids? when all science point to the fact that all this violence in films is the reason for much of the violence happening for real in the world and right outside our neighborhood. parents should ask themselves: what moral things should we learn to our children, how do we want them to become when they grow up?from a father and nurse to all parents.",2,1,4,23 March 2012
Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix," Love It! But wish it was longer
","I saw the movie on the premiere. It was great, but why was it only about 2 hours, couldn't they at least stretch it to 2 hours and 30 minute?I have no problem seeing a film that is 3 hours.It is so much stuff in these books that is left out, so much that also is funny and important part of the story. I think they should at least get minimum 2 1/2 hours of the next film and the last should be 3 hours or more. The last book I have just read, and it is so much stuff in it that is important, that I hope they make it 3 hours.This 5th in the series was very exiting, but I missed some stuff. But I hope they will make some DVD's after the whole series are made, with extended longer versions.",9,2,4,25 August 2007
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," Great, but to short
","I went to Harry Potter and the goblet of fire on the premiere 18.th November in Norway. I have read all the books so far and was looking forward to this movie, but I got a little disappointed for the first time. First of all the plot from the Quidish world cup, when the dark mark appeared was changes too much from what happens in the book. So that just made it to bad. We also got introduced to the real bad guy to fast, in the book it takes longer time, and we can not know who made the Dark mark at first, here we new right away. That spoiled much of the excitement of watching the movie. And for the second reason characters who was important for that plot in the book wasn't even mentioned in the film. We did not meet the Dursleys, we did not meet Mrs.Weasley, the house-elfs and they where important I thought at least.So this is the first time I can't give a full pot to the Harry Potter movies. It was a great film, but to short I say. Titanic lasted 4 hours, and Harry Potter could last just as long with no problem for audience. Many where unhappy about it going bang-bang-bang finished. The story between all the excitement where lost and that is just to bad.so I am really nice giving it a 9 out of 10. I was thinking about 8 mostly, but it is Harry Potter, so I gave it a 9. It is a much darker film, but it seems like it have been hurried to cut it a leave out important plots and what would make it a much better movie. I hope the DVD will have a longer version than the theatrical release. We need at least 1 hour more for this movie than we got. So I am a little disappointed. DVD must have a longer version with the Dursleys, with Mrs.Weasley, Conversations with Black, the house-elfs etc. This was to short and to fast to get the story right. So for the first time I think it wasn't good enough as the others stayed much more like the books. Must be fixed for the order of the phoenix. And by the way all 7 films must have Daniel Radcliffe and the others in it, or the whole series will be stupid. Can not change an actor in the middle of a series, when everyone have gotten used to them. It will be stupid and flop totally if the same actors ain't used in all 7 movies. The books is going to be 7 and we are following them as they get older, as in real life, so it can not be a change in the actors later. I just worries because word say Daniel Radcliffe and the others have only signed up for the 5th so far. But they need to sign up for the last 2 also. This is possibly also the opinion of the world.",9,0,1,18 November 2005
War of the Worlds," Little disappointed but still good film.
","I went to the movies to see this film, after being bombarded with trailers for many months. I was sold at first sight of just a small teaser. But That may also be why the film give me a small disappointment. Yes it was a cool film, but great it wasn't. Much fancy stuff, but not the best story. I mean a girl screaming throughout the whole film, a father with kids trying to run away. We get to see the Aliens and suddenly they all just die because of small things in our water. Aka the film Signs. So the only defense our planet have is small things in our water. Yeah right. If they had studied us for millions of years, I would think the aliens also would know about everything on this planet. And it ended so stupid. So fast just in the middle of the good part - bang - the film is over. Come on! that sucks. hmm must adjust my voting down to a 6. The best was all the great effects, and no one can make aliens like Spielberg. But the ending destroyed my good mood. Almost everyone I have spoken to says the same in Norway at least. It was just to fast ans stupid. Short the film is this:Scream - run - Scream - scream - run - scream - getting interesting - the end. the screaming of the young girl was just too much. And I get furious about using $12 for the movie ticket when I get ripped off like that. The ending sucked and that was that. Could at least have made a better story out of it, changed it a little. Never renting it on DVD, so it was just worth a one time look nothing more.",6,1,4,2 July 2005
Prometheus," Crappy, big disappointment, boring
","These are the words to describe Prometheus. It was in fact a crappy movie compared to the best in 2012. I will give it a 6/10 here, only of the goodness of my heart and for some cool effects. But the story was a old story in new wrapping...or was it old story in old wrapping. I do not know. I caught myself almost falling a sleep in the middle of this boring movie. This movie is blown up to be a 'WOW!' Must see movie..but no...waste of money, I urge people to don't go to the cinema for this it isn't worth it. To make a point to this worse ever Ridley Scott movie, just download it when it comes on any torrent, because it really ain't worth the penny to see. I used $30 on a 3D viewing of this movie, and are very disappointed.Ridley Scott you know you can do better than that!",6,1,4,8 June 2012
The Island," The Island - great film
","Well this was surprisingly good. It was a film worth seeing. I hear of sue made for being a copy of another film; 'Parts: The Clonus Horror'. But it is only small parts that are near to the same story, but that story of 1979 sucked big time, this time the film is much better, and is no way near being the same story. If they would win a sue like this, most films should sue each others. It is not a copy of the old story. In Europe it is very popular, but not in USA. That is strange. But Europeans always have liked special Sci-Fi better than Americans. Maybe because in the USA you have to much cloning for real, like in the cloned milk that is illegal in Europe and Canada, but not in USA. People should be more careful of cloned things in USA. The cloned milk is proved to be unhealthy, but still you drink it. it is a reason why it is banned and illegal in the rest of the world!The film is great, go watch it now!",8,0,1,12 August 2005
