Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," I Can Watch This Film Again And Again
","This is one of the rare films that if I see it one day I could watch it again the next day. I know that a lot of people hat it and thats fine with me. I don't care if you hate it. But personally I think it is just one of the funniest films ever. I mean, the part in the RV is a bit much, but other than that it a riot. What makes it so good is the fact that he never comes out of character, no one realizes he's an actor (even though Borat was in Da Ali G Sho and Movie) and just how funny he is. If you think the character Borat is sexsist, racist, anti-Semitic, homophobic and rude, you are kinda right. But NOT Sacha Baron Cohan. He is just getting a point across that exposes all those thing in the U S and A. If you hate it, Fine, but please don't spoil this fab movie for us. Oh, and if you get the DVD, there is so much more to look forward to, even in the menu. Thanks, Arran.",Null,0,1,5 April 2010
Alien 3," Better than the first two
","(BTW, I'm 13) I had seen the first two (thought no. 1 was a quite slow) and enjoyed them. I read reviews of Alien3 and got the idea it was crap. In my opinion, it is better than the first two, and is a brilliant film on any scale. And I read reviews that said 'it didn't have the suspense or horror of 'Aliens', and that the plot was bad'. WTF??? Alien3 was way more suspenseful and scary. The plot was great, as well as the acting, and you cared about the character more than you did in 'Aliens' (like those stupid Marines). I have not yet seen Alien Resurrection, but have ordered the 'Alien Quadtrilliogy' box set. I think Alien3 is the most underrated film ever, and can't understand why people hate it. I just can't figure out how Alien fans could fail to like it. Weird. Anyway, if you haven't seen it, have you expectations low, because for some reason, people don't like it.",Null,2,3,6 June 2010
