United 93," All Americans Need To See this Movie
","How quickly we as Americans can forget what it felt like on that awful day 5 years ago. This movie was somber reminder of everything that happened and what mainstream American has hoped we will forget. Director Paul Greengrass has made a stunning tribute to the other heroes of 9/11, those men and women on Flight made the ultimate sacrifice to protect our country from any more harm, this movie shows the anguish, fear, and ultimately the bone chilling courage it took to take back control of their destiny. I felt myself screaming inside 'No glory for allah today' as they stormed the cockpit. I sat with my head in my hands with genuine tears in a crowded movie theater until the final credit rolled. This movie should be in every classroom, every university, every American needs to see this movie. I am heading to Shanksville PA to pay my respects.",10,2,8,29 April 2006
Insomnia," Snooze Alert Warning
","I can't understand the applause for this terribly boring and under developed story. After Memento I expected a interactive, thought provoking movie, what I got was a definite disapointment. The name Al Pacino invokes memories of some of the greatest movies of all time (Godfather,Scarface,Heat,to name a few) this will not be mentioned in the same breath as those. Having 3 oscar winning actors in the film is wonderful accomplishment, but it does not make it a Oscar caliber movie. Swank's performance was uninspired and contrived, Pacino's performance almost let me catch some ZZZZ's, Williams as a murderer, ewww terribly frightening,not really. I wish people would not be mesmerized by Pacino, but the fear of criticizing a legend overwhelms most, not me, I dont blame him although it appears he sleepwalks (pun intended) through his scenes, the story is weak, dull, and woefully spotty. If you want to waste your 9$ go see it, if not spend 3$ and rent 'The Usual Suspects'.",1,6,15,1 June 2002
