Sucker Punch," One of the worst movies of all time
","When I first saw the trailer for this movie,I thought the movie looked good.And then I went to go see it when the movie was released in theaters.And my reaction to watching the movie was that I need to go erase this terrible movie from my memory.And on the worst note,I spent my money on this terrible movie.The coloring and the special effects of the movie gave me a terrible headache and the music was terrible.And the theater I went to go see it at,I have been going to see movies at the same movie theater for years,and ever since I saw Sucker Punch,I have never been back ever since.It's because the movie is terrible and it curses you.",3,9,18,9 July 2017
Spider-Man: Homecoming," Best Spider Man movie since Spider Man 2
","I saw Spider-Man Homecoming on the opening night of the movie,and its my favorite Spider Man movie since the 2nd Spider Man movie from the original series.Tom Holland who plays as Spider Man in the Marvel Cinematic Universe does a terrific job on being passed the mantle of playing Spider Man.Michael Keaton also does a great job as playing as the main bad guy of the movie Vulture.The new take on Spider Man of not being dark and gritty its nice to see for a change.And I have a feeling that Tom Holland will keep impressing me on his performance as Spider Man in future Marvel movies.",8,206,380,9 July 2017
Suicide Squad," Don't watch it, DC lied that its good
","When I saw the first trailer for this movie, I loved it so much that it made me want to go see it opening night. I can't believe I waited a whole year for this stupid movie. And I'm really mad that I wasted my money on this movie. Doctor Strange and Rogue One are way better then this movie.And even though Suicide Squad won a Oscar, the Oscars are pretty terrible now.",7,5,9,27 April 2017
Justice League," This movie made me lose hope in DC movies
","When I saw Man of Steel,I really liked it and the movie got me excited to see what the DC Extended Universe was gonna go after Man of Steel.Then I saw Batman v Superman and the feeling was mixed.I then tried to be positive about Suicide Squad being a good DC movie,but I was disappointed at how terrible it was.The only other DC Extended Universe movie I thought was good besides Man of Steel was Wonder Woman.The Wonder Woman movie gave me hope that the Justice League movie would be it's own style and not an avengers rip-off to make more money and catch up to Marvel,boy was I wrong.For the next DC movies coming out in theaters soon,I will rent the DC movies and watch them at my house.",7,2,5,5 January 2018
X-Men: Days of Future Past," This is one of the best superhero movies of all time
","X-Men:Days of Future Past is one of my favorite movies of all time.I love how cast members from the prequels and original movies all appear in the same movie.Every actor and actress in the movie and their performances are really great.I love what Wolverine's reaction was like when he met the younger x-men in the past.And Evan Peters did such a terrific job as Quicksliver. I give the movie 10 out of 10.Ans Jennifer Lawrence did a great job playing as Mystique,one of the reasons why she is one of my favorite celebrities.",10,6,10,5 July 2017
Beauty and the Beast," My top movie of the year right now and one of my favorite Disney movies in the top five
","I first saw the live-action adaption of Beauty and the Beast on opening night at a cinema-capri at one of the Harkins Theaters near me.And when I first saw the first seen with the prince becoming the Beast and seeing Belle sing for the first song of the movie,I instantly felt amazed by the movie.And this is one of the only live action remakes of a movie that is a very beautiful movie.And I love how the movie has a song for the beast and how it reminds me of let it go of how it shows how the beast feels about belle leaving but knows that she will always stay with him in his heart.And also the scene where the beast dies from his injury and all of the castle staff turn into lifeless objects,I felt tears coming from my eyes by how much the characters mean too me.But the part when the enchantress saw how much Belle loves the Beast and it was already too late,she used her magic turn the beast and everybody else back into humans and how the prince/beast and belle are reunited and share true love's kiss and the castle goes back to normal,the scene was so beautiful and amazing.It's my favorite movie of the year and it's a great adaption of one of my favorite Disney animated movies of all time.10/10",10,21,36,30 July 2017
Black Panther," Another great superhero movie by Marvel
","Ever since I was a kid and watched Marvel animated shows on Saturday mornings, one of my favorite Marvel Superheroes on The Avengers:Earth's Mightiest Heroes was Black Panther.For a long time after the success of The Avengers in 2012,I waited to see what the live action movie theater version of Black Panther would look like on the big screen.And in 2016 when the movie Captain America:Civil War was released,Black Panther made his first onscreen appearance and he was played by one of my favorite actors; Chadwick Boseman. And just like the avengers animated show,Black Panther was one of my favorite characters in the movie. And I am glad I saw the movie Black Panther during the opening weekend,because the movie helped make the Marvel Cinematic Universe and also introduced really cool characters in the movie, like Okoye played by Danai Gurira,M'Baku played by Winston Duke, Nakia played by Lupita Nyong'o,Shuri played by Letitia Wright, and N'Jadaka/Eric' Killmonger' Stevens played by Michael B. Jordan.",10,7,19,22 February 2018
Mother!," This movie proves to be a despicable movie by Hollywood to anger people
","I cannot believe this is a movie that exists right now, it makes me really angry that there is a movie to be anti-Christian and anti- symbolic.And this movie made Jennifer Lawrence go from being one of my favorite actresses who always had a good heart to be like a snooby mean celebrity and being rude and mean about the hurricanes and people losing their homes and families which is not cool J.Law. And dating the director of the movie mother! totally changed her attitude and made it creepy how she is dating a guy who could be her father,and is even thinking of marring that creepy director Darren Aronofsky who in my opinion is a terrible director and it's disgusting how he did a awful take on stories from the bible because of him being a atheist. I am glad this movie is doing awful,because people killing a baby who is barely 30 minutes alive and suppose to represent Jesus by killing him and eating a human baby is just one of the most disgusting thigs Hollywood has put in theaters.I hope Paramount loses money from how bad the movie is, and people get to see the real evil side to the once great Jennifer Lawrence for a year.If you want to see the movie, I hope you will walkout and be okay from not being shocked by the despicable Hollywood movie.",1,14,27,26 September 2017
The Purge," Very bad movie and very boring in my opinion
","When I first saw an ad for this, I knew it was going to be bad and very stupid, because I honestly don't see the United States celebrating a holiday where people get to kill each other. And when I first watched it at home, I was honestly bored and not impressed by this movie and it only made me fall asleep after the movie was over.",1,2,4,8 July 2018
