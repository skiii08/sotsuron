Blade Runner 2049," What a waste of money
",Never seen more visually stunning movie sets only added to the frustration of watching thus piss poor attempt at a franchise. The awful story followed up by 2nd grade acting who i dont the blame actors cause they dont yell cut we got it. There is alot of blame to go around for this movie. I can never take Ryan Gossling in a serious role he's really funny in movies like The other guys and LaLa Land. Luckily I can fix this they should make Blade Runner a series and concentrate on the love between Officer K and his virtual wife Joy because it was the the only interesting part of the movie and how do we know this. Cause im always Wright.,1,5,13,21 September 2018
"I, Tonya"," Awesome movie someone still needs to be fired
",Living through this circus when i was a kid i was really looking foward to seeing this flick. It really lived up to everything acting was great Allison Janey I will always love Sebastian Stan i thought was really overlooked award season he was really good in this really funny the whole movie was hilarious so they glad they went that route. But we still have to fire someone the entire movie all i could think about is how perfect of a role this would have been for Amy Adams i felt is borderline criminal she wasnt playing tonya i know it would have been a grandslam this is gonna stay w me awhile thats how perfect it could have been im not a big fan of the Robbie girl at all but she did do a good job was in good hands but when it comes to acting Adams would piss on her. And we know this cause im always Wright.,8,0,3,21 September 2018
