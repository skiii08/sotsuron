First Man," No real need to see twice
","I loved 'The Right Stuff'. Must have seen it more than a dozen times. Loved 'Apollo 13'. Loved' Top Gun'. This movie, while for the most part being historically accurate, doesn't warrant the same type of reaction. It's an emotional effort that last bare the feelings of one of the most private individual this side of Howard Hughes. The history, the X15, the training, the flight, all are second tier to the dark brooding character that gets portrayed. Only the Armstrong children can attest to how accurate the portrayal is, but the final scene is so dark and unnecessary that it soured the previous two hours for me. I have an extensive collection of NASA memorabilia and movies but this one I am ok doing without.",7,3,7,23 October 2018
