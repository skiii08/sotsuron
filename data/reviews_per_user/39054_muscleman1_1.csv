Kill Bill: Vol. 2," The greatest imagination in movie history
","I believe that Tarantino probably has the greatest imagination in the history of film making.  Now some could argue that Spielberg and a few others are better directors(although not many), but no one could come close to creating the character development and bizarre stories that Quentin comes up with.  The cool thing is though, that he makes his bizarre and sometimes corny stories and details work with a mixed aspect of seriousness and timelessness that no one else can construct.  Kill Bill(1 and 2 together) is what I believe the greatest feat in film history.  This is because the movie has some of the funniest scenes ever, the coolest story, and the greatest action.  Despite their being few action scenes, the ones that he puts in the movie are by far the best I've seen.  The film is so great that it doesn't even have a true genre.  It is composed of everything: action, drama, comedy, suspense, thriller....  You name it, and he put it in there.  His films include sub-characters(GoGo,Mr.Blonde) that are remembered as much as some movies' lead roles, and the character of the Bride will probably be remembered years from now as well as Ripley from Aliens and Indiana Jones. This is also a credit to Uma.  So my hats off to Quentin Tarantino for achieving perfection.  Vol.1 didn't and Vol.2 probably won't take home the oscar, but it has to be the biggest cheat in movie history.Kill Bill(1&2) 13/10",10,0,1,18 April 2004
