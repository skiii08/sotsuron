The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," Here's a topic: half human, half vampire children, talk amongst yourselves
","After having seen the previous installments in this series, this one was put on the free movies list on demand, I decided I had nothing but time to lose, I started the movie. As usual, Bella would make her 'trademark' face before painfully delivering one of her lines, Edward looking like he's being staked to death when speaking,their 'chemistry' and everything else that this series is known for. After watching these films,I had somewhat gotten used to these things, and was actually enjoying the movie for what it was......until Jacob ran out of the Cullens' home, and assembled the wolf pack at the lumber yard. When they started talking, my mom and my brother were also looking at the screen in bewilderment, for a moment, we all thought we had been drugged with Walt Disney pills! This scene took what credibility the film had, and threw it out the window! It makes me wonder though... WHAT IN THE WORLD DID ESME FEED THEM IN THOSE SANDWICHES? hmm.....",3,5,6,13 January 2013
