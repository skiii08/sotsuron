Source Code," A movie I should have seen earlier!
","I only got around to watching this movie a week ago. When it first came out, I thought 'ohh great another Hollywood action movie' so I never watched it. This is a great movie and I highly recommend it!The plot centres around a man (Jake Gyllenhaal) who seemingly wakes up in someone else's body on a train opposite a beautiful woman (Michelle Monaghan) who knows him. After 8 minutes, the train explodes, killing everyone, only he wakes up in a capsule of some sort talking to a woman who tells him that he was inside the Source Code, which allows him to relive someone else's life eight minutes before their death, except with free will to make choices and to change outcomes. His mission is to find out who planted the bomb before the attacker in the real world strikes again.Director Duncan Jones (who also directed 'Moon', another great movie) does an excellent job with this film. He incorporates plot twists and a method of slowly unravelling the story. 'Moon' and this movie made me cry at the end. Jake Gyllenhaal, who performed excellently in 'The Day After Tomorrow' doesn't disappoint with this film, showing off his convincing emotions and great acting. Michelle Monaghan also provides a strong supporting role in this movie.Overall, I highly recommend this film despite some bad reviews. 'Source Code' will not disappoint, provided that you can understand the story (I did but just to make sure I had to look it up after). Watch it!",9,1,3,19 November 2013
