Requiem for a Dream," Amazing
","This is my favorite movie of all time and can watch it multiple times without getting bored. I think that all the actors in this movie are fantastic in their roles and that if you are to watch, if you haven't already, then especially listen to the music. The music is what won me over most of all in this movie and really fits the scenes through out the movie. This movie takes you through the drug addictions of 4 characters and how it would affect their lives, and how as soon as you get to the addiction stage of these drugs then you will do whatever you can to keep them up. This is a fantastic movie in my opinion and would recommend it to any and everyone.",10,1,2,27 November 2014
