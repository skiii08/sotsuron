Hereditary," A Truly Horrifying and Haunting Classic, With an Ending that Left Me Confused, But Oddly Pleased.
","Hereditary is one of those movies where when uyou finish watching it, the only thoughts going through your head will most likely be 7 words: 'What the hell did I just watch?!' Seriously, Hereditary will forever be one of those modern classics that any horror geek could watch and enjoy a million times over. With a great cast, beautiful cinematography, and wonderfully created horror that has zero to none of those cheap jumpscares, you WILL be hooked from the first ten minutes. Even though it has a weird ending that I couldn't quite get the first time watching, I still love this movie to bits and will for a while.",9,1,3,9 November 2019
Scream," Wes Craven Strikes Again with Another Gut Clenching Horror Movie.
","What a movie! Wes Craven just took the limits and broke it in half with no remorse! Scream is the normal run-of-the-mill slasher at first glance, but is it really? Not really. While yes, Scream IS about the final girl being chased by the creepy masked guy trope we've all seen throughout the years, but scream takes on a more meta approach and adds more humor along the way. This movie predicts itself in a lot of places, but stills add a bunch of new and creative ideas, such as the kills.The kills and the scares are one reason to watch this movie, and it's a good reason too. The kills are AMAZING in this movie. Their creative, gory, gut-wrenching, but most importantly, scary. The movie captivates you with the mystery of who the killer is and what they plan to do next to our protagonists, which are also a good reason to watch this movie. The characters are not bad at all, they're fun to watch them do their thing and see how they react to their upcoming demise, which sounds dark but hey, it's just a movie.It Overall Scream was an instant classic and scared many when it first came out and still scares people today. I even found myself on the edge of my seat while watching. While it's good scares, great actors, good scares, great kills, amazing killer persona (Ghostface), and what matters most, a damn good twist. This movie will stun you and keep you on your toes every step of the way and will continue to scare many people for years to come, this is a must-watch if you're looking to be scared during any time of day.",10,0,0,11 November 2019
