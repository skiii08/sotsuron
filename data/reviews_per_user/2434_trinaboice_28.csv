Blade Runner 2049," Long-awaited sequel
","Grade: A-Rating: R, 164 minutesIn a Nutshell: This is a LONG movie. If you're a big fan of the 1982 original Blade Runner, you'll probably love every minute, while admittedly, it's not everyone's cup of futuristic tea. This visually stunning sequel was a long time in coming and I'm thrilled that Harrison Ford was able to be in it so we can revisit his character.You don't have to see the original Blade Runner movie first, but it sure helps. While this film stands alone in an impressive way, it also deepens and expands the original. It's a science-fiction masterpiece that has director Denis Villeneuve earning the praise he deserves.Uplifting theme: What makes a man? What is humanity? Life....the value of life, the meaning of life.Things I liked: You had me at Ryan Gosling. When he touched a piano key, I kind of hoped he'd start singing City Of Stars (From 'La La Land' Soundtrack) ha ha Ana de Armas is just fun to look at. I loved her scenes with Ryan Gosling. Robin Wright sure has come a long way since The Princess Bride (one of my all-time faves.) They did an amazing job with creating a new world and time. The cinematography by Roger Deakins is outstanding. Some say it's the best of his career and worthy of an Oscar. The sound is impressive, but sometimes annoying. There are many surprises, which makes movie-going so much fun.Things I didn't like: Everything is so dusty! ha ha Some of the frames are just so long and drawn out and slow-moving. Did I say the same thing three times? There are a lot of scenes where people sit, think, and stare. Lots of monologues. It takes forever to be rewarded with scenes that include both Harrison Ford and Ryan Gosling. You kind of have to watch both films more than once to really understand it. I readily admit I don't get it all.Tips for parents: Kids may be confused with what's happening and get bored. Watching the movie requires a certain amount of patience. Violence. Some gory, bloody scenes. Full female nudity. Prostitute action. Some profanity.MOVIE REVIEW MOM@trinaboice",8,1,8,21 October 2017
Rocketman," Fantastical biopic of the genius that is Elton John
","'My name is Elton Hercules John.' This musical biopic is skillfully guided by actor-turned-director Dexter Fletcher who also worked on Bohemian Rhapsody, a biopic of Freddie Mercury in Queen. This film is timed perfectly to coincide with Elton John's 4-year retirement tour.It's important to know that many of the moments of the movie are not in correct chronological order, just in case you thought this was a factual retelling of sorts. Rocketman has been described by many as more of a fantasy than truth, more of a painting than a mirror. The presentation style of the story was perfect to honor the creativity of the genius that is Elton John.The acting is fantastic and will, hopefully, earn Taron Egerton an Oscar nomination.

Captain Marvel," It's a decent start for this character, but not as MARVELous as we wanted it to be
","It's a decent start for this character, but not as MARVELous as we wanted it to be. Some people will get confused with all of the timeline back-and-forth story line. The de-aging of Agent Coulson and Fury was awesome.You can read my full movie review at Movie Review Mom.",6,1,4,9 March 2019
Deadpool 2," Bigger, but better?
","B+Rating: R, 119 minutesIn a Nutshell: Marvel is on a roll. The X-Force team assembles under the guidance of the most disrespectful, irreverent superhero ever, Deadpool, played expertly by Ryan Reynolds.As Ryan Reynolds says in the movie, 'The Academy's watching.' The sequel is definitely bigger....is it better than the first? Umm....probably not. Did it make me laugh? Definitely.  Tips for parents: 
Deadpool says in the beginning, 'Believe it or not, Deadpool 2 is a family movie.' Nope. Not true. This is a true rated R movie. If you set filters on VidAngel to delete profanity, violence and gore, this would be a 20 minute movie. 
Crude language and TONS of F-bombs. I hate it when kids swear especially, which Julian Dennison does as Russell.
Scoutmaster pervert joke. Ouch. I have 4 sons.
Lots of severed limbs and brutal, gory deaths.
Lesbians
You see a bottomless little kid's junk full Winnie the Pooh style and a man's naked rear end.
Super high body count, destruction, violence, crude gestures.
Guns.
Some fun music, but other songs with very crude lyrics.Uplifting theme: 
'We all need that sense of belonging. We all need a genuine sense of home.' - Deadpool (Ryan Reynolds)
'Kids - they give us a chance to be better than we are...better than we use to be.' - Vanessa (the beautiful Morena Baccarin) 
Family
Sacrifice for others
'Pain teaches us who we are.' - Blind Al (Leslie Uggams)
'No child is hopeless.' - Blind Al Things I liked:
The trailer was hilarious. I loved the crack about Superman's mustache in the trailer, referring to when DC had to use CGI to remove Henry Cavill's mustache in the movie Justice League. 
I got a kick out of the opening credits. Most of the time, we just ignore them, but read them this time!
This is the year of Josh Brolin as the evil villain. He voices a fantastic Thanos in Avengers: Infinity War
Great action sequences. As Deadpool says, 'Big CGI fight coming up.' Yep, LOTS of them.
Tons of fun jokes and visual gags, all lightning fast. You'll have to see the movie again in order to catch everything.
We learn a lot more about Wade Wilson, making his character development more deep and grounded.
You're going to get a kick out of some new twists.
Keep watching after the credits for a couple more fun scenes, but there's nothing at the very, very end of the music.
The Logan music box in the very beginning scene got the audience I sat with to immediately start laughing. There is a running gag about Logan during the entire movie. So funny. For example, both films played the same music during the death scenes. Ha ha
Tony Robbins. Love that guy.
Wade and his girlfriend watch the movie Yentl I always loved that movie and the music. Deadpool points out that the song, 'Papa, can you hear me?' is the same tune as Frozen's 'Do you want to build a snowman?' I never noticed that!
X-Men - trainee! Ha ha
I like Dub Step too. Ha ha
Several Canadian jokes. A lot of locations in Vancouver were actually used in the movie. 
At the end of the movie, it says that 15,000 jobs were created to make the movie. The stunt work was amazing. Sadly a stunt woman, Joi Harris, died while filming one of the stunts on a motorcycle. Production stopped for two days.
Tons of fun Easter eggs. For example, Deadpool refers to Cable, played by Josh Brolin, as 'One Eyed Willy', which was a character in the 1985 movie The Goonies which starred Josh Brolin.
Tons of movie, song, and pop culture references. One of the movie posters shows Deadpool in a Flashdance pose on a chair with bullets raining down on him. He definitely takes a beating in this film.
 Things I didn't like:
This is the first Marvel film to NOT give Stan Lee a cameo performance! Drats! I always look forward to those little moments. Instead, you can see him in a quick picture montage. Definitely not as good.
Sometimes trailers are deceiving. In an earlier trailer for DEADPOOL 2, Deadpool says, 'Pump the hate brakes, Thanos,' referencing Josh Brolin's role as Thanos in Avengers: Infinity War, but in the actual movie, he's talking to two lesbians and he says, 'Pump the hate brakes, Fox and Friends.'
I don't read the comic books, but Domino's character and alliances are much different there than in this movie, as well as her color and eye circle. It certainly didn't bother me, but some fans might be annoyed. Zazie Beetz did a fantastic job.
SPOILER: Have you seen The Terminator? Yeah, that's this plot.Funny lines:
'Forgive me for being late. I was busy gathering all the gluten in the world so it can not NOT hurt us.' - Deadpool
'That is why the man bun is just the Millennial mullet.' - Deadpool
'So dark. Are you sure you're not from the DC Universe?' - Deadpool
'Mission accomplished?' - Dopinder (Karan Soni)
'Well, in a George W. sort of way.' - Deadpool
'Every family film starts with a vicious murder...Bambi. Lion King. Saw 7.' - Deadpool
'It's time to get back on LinkedIn.' - Weasel (T.J. Miller)
Vanisher....ha ha IMDB shows his face listed as Brad Pitt! The studio actually wanted Brad Pitt to play Cable, but he had to decline that role due to scheduling conflicts.
'Never underestimate a man with a mustache.' - Deadpool
'I have no idea what's happening.' - Blind Al
'It's probably best.' - Deadpool
Interesting lines:
'Family was always an F word for me.' - Deadpool
'You are not your father.' - Vanessa
'I fight for what's right.' - Deadpool",8,3,6,19 May 2018
Thor: Ragnarok," hammers into our hearts with entertaining humor and action
","Grade: ARating: PG-13, 130 minutesIn a Nutshell: Count them17! Thor: Ragnarok is the 17th film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. New Zealand director Taika Waititi directs this super colorful, funny superhero movie presented by Walt Disney Pictures. He also voices the lovable character Korg.It's fresh and fun family entertainment that makes us love Thor even more.Uplifting theme: Brother's keeper Forgiveness People are more important than places. Teamwork, unity Love, service to others 'A wise king must never seek out war, but must always be ready for it.' – Thor 'I choose to run towards my problems and not away, because that's what heroes do.' - ThorThings I liked: Chris Hemsworth is awesome, but everyone else in the cast also steals the show. It's a collection of fantastic actors who each contribute unique, entertaining characters to the story. Tom Hiddleston is a better Loki we're learning to love. I have adored the talented, beautiful Cate Blanchett for many years. How is it that she never ages, but I do? She makes a fantastic villain. Anthony Hopkins is always epic. Awwww, Benedict Cumberbatch. Doctor Strange has an amusing visit with Thor. Mark Ruffalo spends more time being The Incredible Hulk, but Hulk is really endearing in this film. Jeff Goldblum is hilarious. I love him in everything he does. Fun surprise cameo towards the very beginning of the movie. No spoilers! It appears that Marvel has finally learned that audiences love fun, funny, irreverent, out-of-the box thinking superhero movies. Ever since the first Guardians of the Galaxy (Plus Bonus Features)thrilled audiences, superhero movies have lightened up a lot more, don't you think? Female fans get to see Chris Hemsworth with his shirt off. Wow, those arms are the size of tree trunks! For those who love his long, golden locks, you're in for a surprise. I love that Marvel puts Stan Lee in every movie. I always look forward to seeing what funny line they give him. Stay until the end of the first set of credits to see more. Then, stay until the very, very end of all the credits to see another funny scene with the Grandmaster. In an interview, Taika Waititi said that 80% of the movie was improvised. What? That's crazy and amazing! Led Zepplin's Immigrant Song really rocks the final battle scene. The Gladiator scene with Thor and Hulk in the arena was extremely entertaining. Some new creatures and characters fill the Marvel Universe with even more creativity and fantasy. Energizing soundtrack: Thor: Ragnarok Things I didn't like: · Some fake video-game looking fight scenes. Some of the jokes don't quite get the reaction I'm sure the director hoped they would. It helps to have seen Thor and Thor: The Dark World and know the characters in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. You'll enjoy the movie more.Funny lines: 'Yes! We know each other! He's a friend from work.' – Thor talking about when he first sees Hulk in the arenaTips for parents: Superhero violence and destruction. You see the naked backside of Hulk. Some profanity Young children may be frightened by a big, fiery monsterMOVIE REVIEW MOM@trinaboice",10,2,9,4 November 2017
Ready Player One," Celebration of video games over the decades
","Grade: A-In a Nutshell: The creator of the largest virtual reality world ever, called the OASIS, dies and leaves a challenge to anyone who can find three invisible keys that lead to a hidden Easter egg to win a fortune and ownership over the OASIS. Directed by Steven Spielberg, it is full of imagination, fun, action, romance, humor, and a moral lesson. Game on!If you're not into video games, this movie is probably not for you. I don't really play video games, but I still enjoyed it. I have four sons who played video games for many years growing up, so I was exposed enough to most of the characters that make an appearance in this movie that I got a kick out of it all. One of my sons is now living his dream as a 3D character artist for the hugely successful video game company Blizzard. 
Tips for parents: 
· Ready Player One is rated PG-13 for tons of violence, bloody images, partial nudity, profanity, and some suggestive material. 
 * I was worried that the movie would glorify video games and encourage kids to plug into technology even more, but the message in the end is that we all need each other and real life. I thought the ending was actually very sweet.
· Some profanity and other crude language.
· A character flips the bird.
· It shows real people losing touch with reality as they play video games.
· Several people have face and body tattoos.
· The leading lady's avatar (Art3mis) has a super skimpy outfit on.
· You see the partial naked back side of a virtual reality woman. 
* There is an important reference to 'Rosebud' in the 1941 movie Citizen Kane that very few kids or even adults will catch.· 
Uplifting theme: 
· 'People need to spend more time in the real world.' - Wade/Parzival
· 'It's not about winning, but playing.' - Wade/Parzival
· 'As painful and terrifying as the real world can be, it's the only place you can get a decent meal...because reality is real.' - Halliday
· 'No man is alone who has a friend.' - I-R0k
· Illusion vs. reality
Real world consequences
 Things I liked:
The movie itself is classic Spielberg with absolutely fantastic action sequences and imagination. 
The special effects are really well done and blend easily from virtual reality environments into scenes with people in reality. 
The movie is overflowing with references that span several decades of movies, music, and pop culture, focusing mostly on the 1980's. While the main character (Wade Owen Watts) is looking for the grand prize, there are TONS of fun Easter eggs for the audience to look for and enjoy during the entire film. At one point, there is a scene with a famous Anime motorcycle that Spielberg is notorious for having rejected 30 years ago, dismissing it as 'unsalable' for film. It's fun to see how he now embraces and celebrates it on the big screen. 
There is some humor and heart in the film with most of the comic relief provided by a scary-looking, yet hilarious character named I-R0k, voiced by T. J. Miller. 
Alvin Silvestri offered an energizing and fun musical score. Originally, Steven Spielberg's favorite composer, John Williams, was going to tackle the project, but he had to step away to finish his work on another Spielberg film, The Post
If you can, try to see the movie in 3D, but it's still fun without the glasses and extra fee. 
Climb Mt. Everest with Batman. Ha ha
I love Simon Pegg and Mark Rylance in anything. Things I didn't like:
· Older folks will probably claim the movie is on sensory overload (they're right), but the younger crowd will feel like they're right in the middle of playing a video game. A really old guy sitting near me in the theater got up and walked out.
There are a LOT of exposition scenes that tell us what's happening and the movie drags a little bit in the Third Act. 
It's a very long 2 hours 20 minutes flick, so Grandpa or Junior may fall asleep.
 Sit farther back in the theater; otherwise, you won't be able to focus on everything going on. There is a LOT happening on the screen.Funny lines:
'There are only 3 things I hate in the world: Steam Punk, pirates, and Tabouli.' - I-R0k (T.J. Miller)
'Am I being punked?' - Aech/Helen (Lea Waithe)
'She wanted to go dancing, so we went to a movie.' - Halliday (Mark Rylance)
'She could be a dude, a 300 pound dude who lives in his mother's basement...and his name is Chuck. Think about that!' - Aech/Helen
'Voila....which is French for....' - I-R0k
'Do you want it or not?' - Anorak (Mark Rylance)Interesting lines:
'People go to the Oasis for all the things they can do, but they stay because of all the things they can be.' - Wade
'A fanboy knows a hater.' - Parzival
'Things move forward whether you like it or not.' - Ogden Morrow (Simon Pegg)If you loved it and want more, check out the book that it's based on, Ready Player One ,written by Ernest Cline. The movie adds to and deletes from the source material, frustrating true fanboys, but they both have something to offer. Cline actually mentioned Steven Spielberg in the original novel.",8,0,1,30 March 2018
Spider-Man: Homecoming," Training Wheel Protocol balances superhero with teenage life
","Grade: A-In a Nutshell: Another Spider-Man? Really? I rolled my eyes when I saw that yet one more Spider-Man origin movie was being made...6 movies in 15 years with 3 different lead actors. BUT, this isn't exactly an origin movie and it offers some fresh new takes on the story that you just might get a kick out of. Complete with a dental retainer, Spanish quiz, and best-friend secret handshake, Peter Parker is a goofy teenager who struggles with the 'Training Wheel Protocol' as he learns how to become a true superhero and Avenger. With plenty of action and humor, this is another effective arrow in Marvel's growing cinematic quiver.This new version of Spider-Man, directed by Jon Watts, really captures the innocence, naivete, and adolescence of everyday teenage life. It offers an impressive balance between superhero and high schooler. One of the movie posters does a great job of illustrating that.Uplifting theme: 'Times are changing. It's time we change too.' – Adrian Toomes (This idea also explains the existence of this new Spider-man remake)Take time to figure out who you are. Service, love, friendship, family.Things I liked: Tom Holland has the 15 year old personality to offer a unique perspective on this young superhero, as well as the 6-pack abs to make you believe he can be a powerful Avenger. I love Michael Keaton in anything he does. He had to get a kick out of playing this flying role as The Vulture, after winning awards for his quasi superhero character in Birdman. They did a great job with creating a backstory and motivation for The Vulture. He's a scavenger, which is what vultures do. I loved all of the different features on Spiderman's enhanced suit given to him by the tech genius Tony Stark. 'Enhanced Interrogation Protocol.' Ha ha Spider drone. I hate spiders, but that drone was pretty cool. Peter Parker says to his Spanish teacher, 'Me gusta hacer la tarea.' There aren't any subtitles, so I thought you might like to know what he said. 'I like to do homework.' Ha ha There's a short clip from Marvel's Captain America: Civil War to remind you where we first saw this new Tom Holland version of Spider-man. The 3D really pays off during the Washington, DC scenes, as well as any time Peter Parker is scaling buildings. Is the US Academic Decathlon a real thing? Yes, it is! www.usad.org Check out the dramatic backsplash in Adrian Toomes' kitchen. It doesn't have anything to do with the story; I just thought it was interesting. Cool cloaking feature on Tony Stark's plane. I love that Marvel always includes a cameo performance by creator Stan Lee. I get a kick out of seeing what oddball lines they choose to give him. In this film, he says, 'Don't make me come down there, you punk!' ha ha Speaking of Stan Lee, he has always said that people relate so much to Spiderman, because he's just a normal kid with normal problems. That's exactly what makes this new version of Spiderman so likable. Was the National Monument really built by slaves as Michelle suggests? While there is no definite evidence that proves she's right, there are quite a few other national monuments and famous buildings in Washington, D.C. that were. The guard at the monument gives a 'so-so' hand gesture, which is actually a good answer to the question. Keep watching during the rolling credits for a little hint at the next film in the series. Keep watching until the VERY end of all of the credits for a funny PSA announcement from Captain America. I love that Marvel includes those funny clips at the end of their movies. By the way, the entire movie is filled with funny PSA announcements by Captain America. Love him. I love the movie Ferris Bueller's Day Off so I got a kick out of the scene when Peter Parker is running through a bunch of people's yards and then you actually see that movie clip playing on someone's TV inside their house. ha ha I like that there are times when Spider-man doesn't have any buildings to swing around on to travel. What's a superhero to do? Instead, he has to run! Ha ha Tons of Easter Eggs for true comic book fans. Jacob Batalan makes for a great best friend and provides some great interaction and dialogue for Peter Parker. Cameo by Gwyneth Paltrow as Pepper Potts.Things I didn't like: The movie starts with a shaky cam technique which made me immediately worry that this was how the entire movie was going to be. Thankfully, it only lasts a couple of minutes and exists to show you that Peter Park is just an awkward teenager who keeps a video diary and is eager to learn everything and prove himself. A lot of Spider-man's powers come from Tony Stark's high tech suit that was gifted to Peter Parker, and not his actual 'spidey sense.' Don't get me wrong, the new suit is awesome. What's up with Aunt May's high-waisted pants? Is that back in fashion now? Are they trying to make the hot actress, Marisa Tomei, look frumpy or something? There is a LOT of Audi product placement in this movie.Tips for parents: Some profanity. Lots of violence and destruction. Ned tells a teacher he's looking at porn. It's supposed to be funny. It's not. The writers couldn't think of anything clever for him to say? The movie takes its time to develop characters, so little kids might actually get bored. @trinaboice",9,16,27,8 July 2017
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse," Already nominated for a Golden Globe for Best Picture Animation
","Well deserved award nomination and I hope it receives more!

Dunkirk," Immersive experience
","Grade: A-Rating: PG-13, 107 minutesIn a Nutshell: I write marketing reports for movie theaters and have felt terrible for Dunkirk the past few months, because their trailers almost always elicited ZERO response from the audiences. Well, audiences are speaking VERY loudly now. They LOVE Christopher Nolan's newest film, Dunkirk, based on the true WWII story.If you can see it in 70mm on an IMAX, do it. Christopher Nolan went to great lengths to make sure that his movie was as accurate as possible. The details are impressive. With thousands of Extras on the beach, this film is epic.The director's goal was to create an immersive experience. That it is.Uplifting theme: 'Hope is a weapon. Survival is victory.' Human resolveThings I liked: With real planes, real locations, and hundreds of Extras. Everything looked and FELT real. Technically, it is awe-inspiring. Do I smell an Oscar? The sound track is explosive and riveting, filled with intensity almost the entire time. I really liked the trailer tag line: 'When 400 soldiers couldn't get home, home came for them.' Teenage girls and fans of One Direction will be thrilled to watch Harry Styles as Alex. I love Oscar winner Mark Rylance in everything he does. I especially loved him in Bridge of Spies DVD and thought he was adorable in The BFG (Theatrical Version). SPOILER: I LOVED what Peter (Tom Glynn-Carney) did for Cillian Murphy's character at the end. I would hope that my 4 sons would have that kind of character and compassion. That small moment was extremely touching for me. I know a water scene is good when it makes me hold my breath. Rather than focus on big battle movements, the film takes it to a personal level and shows you how war affects the individual.Things I didn't like: You don't really get to know any of the characters and develop a strong connection. The film's action reminded me of Saving Private Ryan, yet that film carried so much more weight and emotional pull on my heart because of the character development. It's my all-time favorite war movie. You're not given any backstories in this film, however, and there are no quiet scenes where characters talk about their lives. Because of everyone's thick accents, you can't understand everything that's said. I probably missed a good 20% of the dialogue. I thought it was interesting that Tom Hardy would want a role like this. He played Farrier, a pilot whose face was completely covered almost the entire time. My 17 year old son, surprisingly, said he thought the movie was a little slow. The film runs almost in real time. SPOILER: We see only a few small boats coming to the rescue, but in reality, the number was closer to 700. I wish I could have seen a map to better understand where everything was located. Here's one:Interesting lines: 'He's shell-shocked George. He's not himself. He may never be himself again.' – Mr. Dawson (Mark Rylance) 'Well done.' – old, blind British man 'All we did was survive.' – Tommy (Fionn Whitehead) 'That's enough.' – old guy 'There's no hiding from this, son.' – Mr. Dawson 'What do you see?' – Colonel Winnant (James D'Arcy) 'Hope.' - Commander Bolton (Oscar nominated Kenneth Branagh)Tips for parents: This war movie is intense with MANY moments of life or death. Despite the high body count, it isn't super bloody and gory like Saving Private Ryan. There was a surprising lack of profanity. I thought I heard an F-bomb, but because the accents were so thick, I can't honestly say that's what the word was. Want to learn more about this part of history in World War II?

Avengers: Infinity War," Epic
","Grade: ARating: PG-13, 156 minutes (the longest Marvel film to date)In a Nutshell: Starring...well....EVERYONE! All of your favorite Marvel superheroes get spotlighted, a difficult task that the Russo brothers capably tackled.As the 19th film released by Marvel Studios in the past 10 years or so, with more to hit the Big Screen next month and into the summer of 2018, clearly, Marvel is the big boy at the Box Office.I've been looking forward to this movie for a long time and I don't want to include a bunch of spoilers here, so this review will be, surprisingly, quite short! I want you to be able to experience all of the fun excitement and heartbreaking drama for yourself. The one word that truly describes this movie is EPIC.
Uplifting theme: 
Â· Hope and desperation
Sacrifice for others
Revenge
Love
The price of war
Friendship, forgiveness, mending old wounds
GenocideTips for parents: 
Some profanity, but no F-bombs.
LOTS of violence, sometimes with bloody, brutal deaths. Super high dead body count. 
LOTS of destruction and people in perilous situations.
Some characters we have come to know and love actually die in this movie. Your heart will break. It's a bit surprising and especially sad for people who really love these characters.
Some creepy, scary monsters and characters.
 Things I liked:
I loved it when the superheroes met each other for the very first time. The audience I watched the movie with especially howled with laughter when the Guardians of the Galaxy (my favorite Marvel characters) meet Thor.
Josh Brolin as Thanos is awesome. Thanos is a truly evil villain because of his motivation.
The humor is perfect. The characters play off each other really well with extremely entertaining banter.
I'm not a fan of the 'shaky cam' technique, so I was grateful that the Russo brothers were careful not to use it much. There is, however, a LOT of action, so you'll want to sit towards the back of the theater in order to see it all without getting dizzy.
Marvel's storytelling has an unpredictability to it that makes it even more fun for viewers and fans. You just can't always predict what's going to happen. 
Keep watching after the rolling credits for a final scene that hints at what's to come. The good news is that there is more to come! 
I love it when Marvel gives Stan Lee a cameo spot. It's always so fun to see where they put him in the movies.
Iron Man's new nano-tech uniform was super cool.
I adore Paul Betany and loved seeing him 'not' red for a short time.
 Fantastic fight and action sequences.
Impressive CGI. It's truly amazing what they can do in film nowadays. Things I didn't like:
When you mix that many bigger-than-life characters, the film is bound to be crowded, busy, and uneven in tone.
The ending is a bit vague and unfinished. We don't quite know what happened, but one thing is certain...there will be a grand finale! It kind of feels like the Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers, which was good, but somewhat unsatisfying because you knew you'd have to wait another year for the rest of the story.
Quite a few Avenger-related characters were not present.
 You really need to have seen all of the recent Marvel movies in order to understand the back stories of the characters and appreciate the many Easter eggs and jokes.Funny lines:
'Fun isn't something one considers when balancing the universe, but this does put a smile on my face.' - Thanos (Josh Brolin

A Quiet Place," Gripping and suspenseful
","Grade: A-In a Nutshell: We all fell in love with John Krasinski when he first appeared in The Office: The Complete Series. He has since gone on to show us his action hero chops in movies like 13 Hours: The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi and his creativity and humor in 'Lip Sync Battle.' This is now his third time directing and I'm convinced he will continue to bring us something fresh.If this movie were a typical talking horror movie, it wouldn't have been nearly as frightening. The tension and suspense are magnified in the silence. #StayQuietTips for parents: 
There are a lot of subtitles kids will need to read.
The alien monsters are pretty scary looking.
Children are constantly in perilous situations.
Bloody, dead body.
You see a pregnant woman's 'water' break and later you see blood when she's getting ready to give birth in a bath tub.Uplifting theme: 
Family, unity
Sacrifice
Resourcefulness
 Things I liked:
I loved seeing John Krasinski and his lovely, talented wife Emily Blunt in a movie together. I can't wait to see her in the upcoming 'Mary Poppins'!
My niece learned American Sign Language and later married a deaf man who has a cochlear implant, like the one seen in this 'silent' movie. It's so wonderful to see capable deaf people portrayed in films. Another movie that puts ASL in the spotlight is 'Rampage.' Millicent Simmonds, who plays Regan Abbott, is actually deaf in real life. This is her second movie; her first was Wonderstruck.
Yes, you get to see the aliens.
Every time I saw a trailer for this movie, the audience would get completely silent and you could feel the tension in the theater. That's how gripping this movie is.
More often than not, horror movies have a lot of characters so that people can be killed off. The result is usually that we don't care about them. In this movie, we're only given one family and we become quickly invested in them.
I always get annoyed by the dumb choices characters make in horror movies, but this family is pretty smart and has figured out how to live in a silent world.
I like that this movie starts on Day 89 after the alien invasion happened. It would have been a much different movie if it had shown Day 1. Not knowing many details about what happened added to the tension.
 Things I didn't like:
It didn't make sense to me that Regan Abbott would even need a hearing aid in a world where silence is what keeps people alive. Interestingly, it's her hearing aid that becomes an important part of the story.
The viewer is never told where the alien creatures come from. It appears they simply kill noisy people, rather than eat them. The little we know about them comes from old newspaper headlines that are hung in the family's basement and a few TV sound bites. Fans of this movie are making all kinds of YouTube videos to talk about the details they wish they knew.
There are some little details that might annoy you, so just don't worry about them.
If you watch this in a theater, PLEASE be quiet so that everyone else in the theater can enjoy the quiet experience.",9,1,4,9 April 2018
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales," Franchise fatigue
","Grade: BRating: PG-13, 135 minutesIn a Nutshell: I guess this is what you call 'Franchise Fatigue.' Audiences are getting a little tired and so is this series. Disney might see a surge in the 50 year old theme park favorite, but overall, fans are wistfully remembering back to the old days when Jack Sparrow was fresh and new.It's better than the last couple of installments, and you'll be entertained if you're not expecting much. Will there be a #6? Probably. What am I saying? Of course there will be! This is the 12th highest grossing franchise film of all time.Uplifting theme: 'Just because you can't see something doesn't mean it's not there.' – Carina Smyth Friendship, loyalty, family Things I liked: Great special effects. Pretty amazing visuals above and below the water. While totally over-the-top, Javier Bardem plays a sufficiently scary villain named Captain Salazar. Did you know he was married to the beautiful Penelope Cruz, who starred in Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides ? Brenton Thwaites is just the eye candy young female fans want. SPOILER: I love that Orlando Bloom makes a couple of appearances. SPOILER: Great ending! The audience cheered when they saw Keira Knightley. At first, she said she wasn't interested in being in the movie, but audiences will all be grateful that she changed her mind.Horologist. Ha haCGI Jack Sparrow when he was young. Interesting. At first I thought they found a young actor who looked like Johnny Depp, but then I could see when the lips didn't quite match the words and could tell it was CGI. Captain Jack Sparrow's father was played by a Rolling Stone (Keith Richards) and now, his uncle is played by a Beatle (Paul McCartney)! He's seen singing 'Maggie Mae', which is an old drinking song of the sea from Liverpool. 'A skeleton walks into a bar, orders a mop and a beer....' is the same joke told by Al Pacino to Johnny Depp's character in Donnie BrascoThings I didn't like: It's so loud that a lot of the lines get swallowed up in other sound effects and so you can't always hear what people are saying. Kaya Scodelario just a good job as Carina Smith. Her dress was so low cut and she was always out of breath that I got tired of seeing her heaving chest in almost every scene she was in.Slapstick comedy and goofy lines get wearisome. As much as I love Johnny Depp, his character didn't bring anything new to this movie and was far less interesting than the others. He supplies some humor, but that's about it. He's not clever and witty, like in the first movie; he's just a drunk buffoon. A lot of jokes are recycled over and over. There's no sense of urgency. The pacing kind of lags and I started actually getting sleepy. It feels long, even though it has the shortest running time of all the Pirates flicks. They filmed some of the boat scenes in the first movie on the actual ocean, but a lot of the similar scenes in this movie look like they're on a set with a green screen. Disappointing.Funny lines: 'We'll honeymoon in the barn.' – ugly lady who Jack Sparrow is forced to marry Interesting lines: 'Dead men tell no tales.' – Captain Salivar 'Who am I to you?' – Carina 'A treasure.' – Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush)Tips for parents: Lots of fighting, violence, and high body count. Umm...pirates. Duh. Decapitated heads in a basket. Lots of destruction. Some inappropriate sexual innuendos.MOVIE REVIEW MOM@trinaboice",7,1,7,27 May 2017
Coco," Celebrates family and honors heritage
","Grade: ARating: PG, 1 hour 49 minutesIn a Nutshell: This extremely vibrant, colorful animation by Pixar has heart, visually stunning effects, and celebrates a wonderfully rich Mexican culture that we rarely get to see in the movies. It will have you contemplating what happens to you and your loved ones after we die as an added inspiring bonus.If you're not familiar with Mexico's 'Day of the Dead' holiday, you might be a little creeped out by all of the skeletons at the beginning of the movie, but by the end, you'll wish your country celebrated it too.My twin sister and I wrote a book together about how to research your family tree and celebrate your heritage. People from around the world sent us their inspiring stories about how they felt their ancestors from 'the other side' helping them to find the missing information they were looking for on their family tree! If you want to have a spiritual experience, do your genealogy! Click here to learn more about our book called Climbing Family Trees, Whispers in the Leaves.Uplifting theme: 'One cannot deny who one is meant to be.' – Ernesto de la Cruz (Benjamin Pratt) 'Seize your moment.' – Ernesto de la Cruz Helping friends 'Nothing is more important than family.' – Miguel . Families ARE forever! Life goes on beyond this mortal experience. 'That's what family is supposed to dosupport you.' – Miguel 'Never underestimate the power of music.' – Ernesto de la CruzThings I liked: I adore Jaime Camil. His character is ridiculous and charming on Jane the Virgin, Season 1 (5 Discs). The colorful, stacked houses in the movie were inspired by Guanajuato in Mexico. The music is really engaging. The actual composer of the movie appears in caricature as the conductor at the end of the movie. I thought it was cool how they used the Aztec marigold throughout the movie to connect things together. It's used traditionally on the Day of the Dead for the same purpose: to connect the living with the dead. If you see this film in the theaters, you'll get to see an ADORABLE 21 minute musical short of 'Olaf's Frozen Adventure' with characters from the movie Frozen (2013) Apparently, quite a few audiences in Mexico have complained that it's too long! Ha ha I thought it was awesome and the audience I saw with applauded happily at the end of it. It's all about families and their traditions during the holidays. Super cute. After the Frozen (2013) short, the directors of the movie COCO also talked for a minute, which is something I rarely see before a movie starts. Interesting. The beginning of the movie was clever how it told Miguel's ancestry through lacy flags. The movement of the animation was AMAZING. The details were so impressive. I watched an interview with director Lee Unkrich, who explained that they tied GoPro HERO cameras on people playing the guitar in order to get the fingers exactly right as they played. I loved the tiny details in each frame. For example, you could actually see tiny little chin hairs on Great Grandma Coco (Ana Ofelia Murguia). Voice talents include Benjamin Bratt, Gael Garcia Bernal, Anthony Gonzalez, Alanna Ubach, Gabriel Iglesias, and Latino legend Edward James Olmos.Things I didn't like: It reminded me a lot of Book of Life movie, which came out three years ago from Twentieth Century Fox. I personally liked this one more.Fun Facts: In Brazil, the name of this movie is 'Viva', which means 'life', because the word 'coco' sounds too similar to the Portuguese word for 'poop.' This film broke the record for the longest production time, because it started in 2011 and didn't hit theaters until November 2017. Merchandising has really gone big. Southwest Airlines actually painted one of their Boeing airplanes in Coco design. The Santa Cecilia graveyard in the movie is named after the Catholic saint of musicians. Dante, the dog, is named after Dante Alighieri, who wrote The Divine Comedy and also went on a journey to the world of the dead.Interesting lines: 'You don't have to forgive him, but you shouldn't forget him.' – Miguel 'The music is not just in me. It IS me.' – Ernesto de la Cruz 'No one was going to hand me my dream. I had to reach out and take it.' – Ernesto de la CruzTips for parents: You'll hear the word 'chamaco', which means 'kid.' In some Latino cultures, it has more of a connotation of 'brat.' The story might be hard for young children to follow. Some of the dead ancestors are a bit spooky and creepy. There are TONS of skeletons! Challenge your kids to spot the Pixar character pinatas hanging along the street in the beginning of the movie (Buzz Lightyear, Wood, Mike Wazowski). You'll also see the Pizza Planet delivery truck in another scene. I love that. A lot of Spanish words are spoken with no subtitles. You'll still understand the story if you don't speak Spanish. Here are a couple that are important to know: Mijo = Mi hijo = my sonOfrendas = offeringsThere are some 'spirit guide' animals in the story. This is a perfect time to talk to your kids about what you believe happens to people and animals after we die. People drink alcohol. No profanity.",10,4,13,30 November 2017
Hotel Mumbai," No new insights
","Based on the chilling true story of the 2008 attack on the Taj Mahal Palace Hotel by a group of Pakistani terrorists. It's heartbreaking to see so many innocent lives taken by such a senseless act of violence. Quite a few movies have already been made about this horrific event in India. This one doesn't necessarily add anything new to what has been stated before, other than bring it to the attention of American movie-goers.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2," Volume 2 brings 2x the fun and action
","Grade: ARating: PG-13, 137 minutesIn a Nutshell: I loved the first Guardians Of The Galaxy and have been sooo excited to see this next one!I wasn't disappointed. James Gunn's Volume 2 sequel is creative, fun, wacky, action-packed, and extremely entertaining. Because it's Volume 2, there are 2 times the action, 2 times the explosions, 2 times the gags and laughs.As Groot says, 'Welcome to the frickin Guardians Of The Galaxy!' (Although he didn't use the word 'frickin'.)Uplifting theme: 'There are 2 kinds of beings in the universe: those who dance and those who do not.' – Drax (Dave Bautista) 'I wanted more. I desired meaning.' – Ego (Kurt Russell) You need to dance more. Family isn't always just what you are born into. Friendship, sacrifice 'Sometimes the thing that you're searching for your whole life is right there by your side all along and you don't even know it.' - Peter Quill/Star-lord (Chris Pratt) Things I liked: The opening credits alone were awesome and hilarious. That's what I'm talking about! What a way to start the ride. Groot! Oh my gosh, he's soooooo awesome! Chris Pratt sure has come a long way since his flubby days on Parks and Recreation: The Complete Series. Female fans even get to enjoy his new six-pack abs when he takes his shirt off. Kurt Russell! Nice job on the scenes in the opening of the movie when he was younger. Harpulary Batteries. Ha ha We learn so much more about Rocket and his motivations in this one. Sylvester Stallone! The music soundtrack Guardians of the Galaxy: Awesome Mix Vol. 1 (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack) is a lot of fun and plays an important role in the story, like in the first flick. As expected, a lot of slow motion shots. Hilarious. Epic. Talk about a sister feud. Jeez. I love that Marvel always puts Stan Lee in their movies. He actually shows up twice this time in Volume 2. Really great special effects. The talented cast includes Chris Pratt, Zoe Saldana, Dave Bautista, Bradley Cooper, Vin Diesel, Michael Rooker, and Kurt Russell. Taserface. Ha ha There was actually a lot of character development and backstory information about our heroes and even some of the villains. It really adds depth to the movie and care even more. In the last movie, Kevin Bacon got some funny shout-outs. This time it's David Hasselhoff. Ha ha Zune. 300 songs. Ha ha Keep watching after the credits start to roll at the end and stay seated until the very, very end. There are quite a few scenes to watch.Things I didn't like: A lot of inappropriate jokes. Some of the lines and scenes in the trailer are different from the actual movie. That always bugs me.To truly appreciate it, you need to have seen the first Guardians Of The Galaxy. The 'gold' people look cool, but I didn't quite get into what they were all about. As much as I enjoyed it, it's still not as good or fresh as the original. Sequels rarely are, right?Interesting lines: 'All you do is yell at each other. You're not friends.' – Nebula (Karen Gillan) 'You're right. We're family.' – Drax 'When you're ugly and someone loves you, you know they love you for who you are. Beautiful people never know who they can trust.' – Drax Funny lines: 'So, we're really saving the galaxy again?' – Rocket (Bradley Cooper) 'I guess!' – Peter Quill/Star-Lord 'Awesome! We're really going to be able to jack up our prices for 2 times galaxy savers!' – Rocket 'Yes, I prefer to make people the old-fashioned way.' – Peter Quill/Star-Lord 'I'm sorry. I'm using the wrong eye again. That was supposed to be behind your back.' – Rocket after calling the high priestess a douche- bag and then winking. 'Don't call me a raccoon!' – Rocket 'I'm sorry. I took it too far. Trash Panda.' – Peter Quill/Star-Lord 'Like they say, you're out of luck until you go duck.' – Howard the Duck (He made a surprise and funny appearance at the very end of the first movie.) 'Ha ha. You look like Mary Poppins.' – Peter Quill/Star-Lord 'Is he cool?' – Yondu (Michael Rooker(Standee advertisement at my local Regal theater)Tips for parents:There is a lot of crude humor. Some profanity. Lots of violence. SPOILER ALERT: You'll laugh out loud and be able to relate to the teenage Groot at the very end. Ha ha Loved it.",10,13,22,3 May 2017
The Shape of Water," Certified fresh and odd
","Grade: A-In a Nutshell: Certified fresh! This 'adult fairy tale' was produced, directed, and written by Guillermo Del Toro. The film combines a love story with science fiction and Cold War drama. Some critics have likened it to Beauty And The Beast meets Creature from the Black Lagoon. It's odd, for sure.
This film has received more Oscar nominations than any other film! Many of them are technical noms. We'll see how many they win.Tips for parents: This movie is rated R for a reason. It's not appropriate for children's viewing.
A LOT of full frontal nudity of a woman. Another woman opens her shirt to reveal her bare chest.
Woman pleasures herself in a bathtub
Crude language, F-bombs, and profanity
You see a married couple have sex.
You learn sign language for some words.
Racism
Homosexuality
Hypocrisy 
Hope, compassion, humanity
Uplifting theme: Feeling incomplete and unfulfilled in life and how we fill that void.
Love can't be defined.
Humanity, outsiders
Friendship, loyalty
Things I liked:Sally Hawkins gives a really great performance with no words. Guillermo Del Toro said that he wrote the movie with only her in mind. Her character's last name is 'Esposito' which is Italian, given to orphaned children, meaning 'exposed' or 'abandoned.'
Michael Shannon is fantastic, as always. He successfully makes you hate his guts. 
The talented ensemble also includes Richard Jenkins, Doug Jones, and Academy Award winner Octavia Spencer.
Some people watch a classic scene from a Shirley Temple movie. Music and dance play a role in the movie.
Beautiful production design with incredible colors. It uses practically every shade of green.
I loved the Old Hollywood nods to lots of other movies.
A surprising musical number.
Doug Jones spent three hours every day to get into his costume.
Things I didn't like:Way too much nudity, awkward sex, and crude language.
The end is pretty predictable.
A bit of a creepy love affair.
Interesting lines:'He's not even human.' - Giles (Richard Jenkins)
'If we do nothing, neither are we.' - Elisa Esposito (Sally Hawkins)'Life is but the shipwreck of our plans.' - Daily Thought
'I'm not a good liar...except Bruster. It takes a lot of lies to keep a marriage going.' - Zelda (Octavia Spencer)",7,4,7,16 February 2018
Murder on the Orient Express," Beautifully made with a disappointing fizzle
","Grade: BRating: PG-13, 1 hour 54 minutesIn a Nutshell: With an incredible A-list cast, this is a well-made, stylish 'Who-dunnit' mystery directed by Kenneth Branagh, who also stars as the Belgium inspector Hercule Poirot. It's extremely picturesque and beautiful, yet slowly fizzles with a disappointing reveal of who the murderer is.Uplifting theme: 'We seek the truth from within, not without.' â€“ Hercule Poirot (Kenneth Branagh) 'Sometimes the law of man is not enough.' â€“ Pilar Estravados (Penelope Cruz) 'poison of deep grief', healing, peace Revenge Right vs. wrong and everything in betweenThings I liked: The period pieces and costumes of the 1930's are beautiful. You don't often see movies that take their time telling the story. Both the time period and the style of movie-making seemed old- fashioned. It was shot in 65 mm and really immerses you in the various environments. The sets are incredible. The all-star cast includes the talented Johnny Depp, Josh Gad, Willem Dafoe, Judi Dench, Penelope Cruz, Michelle Pfeiffer, Leslie Odom Jr., Daisy Ridley and Derek Jacobi. Kenneth Branagh was absolutely outstanding. You might wonder how old Judi Dench isÂ…She was born in 1934, making her 82 years old. There was some humor, although the tone was a bit inconsistent, beginning with a very light feel and then remaining mostly dark for the rest of the film. There were some really great camera sequences. One scene was shot from above the characters as they talked. Another scene was shot from outside the train as it scanned the people walking down the hall through the windows. You really feel the movement of the train and feel like you're on one. There is a reference to a murder on the Nile, possibly a sneak peek into a sequel, but definitely a reference to another one of Agatha Christie's books called Agatha Christie's Poirot: Death on the Nile. Speaking of the author, Agatha Christie's Poirot: Murder on the Orient Express was her best-selling novel. The movie begins at the Wailing Wall in Jerusalem with some gorgeous vistas and a funny sequence. One of these days, I'm going there. There are some beautiful vistas in Istanbul. One of these days, I'm going there too. Michelle Pfeiffer sings 'Never Forget', which was co-written by director/actor Kenneth Branagh. Wow, he was really busy with this film. The photo of Katherine, Hercule Poirot's lost love, is actually Emma Thompson, Kenneth Branagh's real ex-wife.Things I didn't like: Some say it grinds to a halt, rather than get more intense. Yeah, it's true. The ending is anti-climatic. In the 1974 version of Murder on the Orient Express, the star- studded ensemble had equal moments of importance; whereas this version doesn't go into much depth with each character and kind of fizzles. A lot of movie critics are comparing it to the movie Clue which was able to develop characters much better. Daisy Ridley's character is way too young for her character, who should be much older. Sergei Polunin is a famous ballet dancer in real life, but we don't get to see him dance at all! Instead, we get to see him beat up some people. All of the actors were great, but felt underutilized. So much talent wasted. I heard a lady sitting near me say, 'That mustache has to go!' Hercule Poirot's double- decker mustache is ridiculous, but his mustache mask is even worse. Ha ha When the 1974 movie of Murder on the Orient Express Agatha Christie was still alive and she commented on how much she didn't like Albert Finney's mustache on his Hercule Poirot's character.Interesting lines: 'Romance never goes unpunished.' â€“ Hercule Poirot 'To a man with a hammer, everything is a nail.' â€“ Mary Debenham (Daisy Ridley's character is actually quoting Mark Twain.) 'There is right. There is wrong. There is nothing in between.' â€“ Hercule Poirot (He learns about grey areas.) 'Vice is where the devil finds his darlings.' â€“ Pilar Estravados (Penelope Cruz) Funny lines: 'Did we die?' â€“ Hercule Poirot Tips for parents: Young children may get bored, as it's a 'talking' movie that unfolds slowly. There are some subtitles when two people speak German. French is spoken, but there are no subtitles.MOVIE REVIEW MOM@trinaboice",8,1,5,11 November 2017
Wonder Woman," WONDERful
","Grade: A-Rating: PG-13, 141 minutesIn a Nutshell: I used to watch Wonder Woman on TV back when I was a little girl. I loved it. I thought she was beautiful, kind, and strong. As a little girl, it made me feel like I could do almost anything. Yep, this superhero movie is about female empowerment, but it has a lot more than that.I don't know why it has taken this long to bring Wonder Woman to the Big Screen. Maybe we were waiting for the perfect Gal Gadot.This fun action flick has just the right amount of humor and Justice League magic. Warner Brothers gives us an extremely entertaining summer popcorn blockbuster that gives Marvel a run for its money. It's part of a set up for Justice League and a planned trilogy for Wonder Woman.Uplifting theme: 'If you see something wrong happening in the word, you can either do nothing or you can do something.' - Steve Trevor (Chris Pine) 'What one does, when faced with the truth, is more difficult than you would think.' – Diana/Wonder Woman (Gal Gadot) 'It is our sacred duty to defend the world.' – Diana/Wonder Woman 'Everyone is fighting their own battles, Diana, just as you're fighting yours.' - Sameer 'A promise is unbreakable.' - Diana 'Only love can truly save the world.' - Diana Love vs. hate, peace vs. war, humanityThings I liked: Gal Gadot and Chris Pine are both gorgeous and awesome. As Chris Pine's character explains, 'I am above average.' Gal Gadot has the perfect accent to sound exotic. As Sameer says about her, 'OMG, that is a work of art.' Eye candy for everyone. Great female stunt work. Some cool and fun slow-motion, as well as sped-up action sequences. Female director Patty Jenkins was going to film Wonder Woman back in 2005, but she became pregnant and the project was put on hold. She said she was thrilled to be able to pick up the project again, because it was the movie she had been wanting to make her whole life. She's the first woman to direct a superhero film with a female protagonist. We haven't seen a female superhero since Electra in 2005. It's about time, right? Most of the CGI is very good, although it becomes a bit heavy towards the end. Gal Gadot was actually 5 months pregnant during some of the filming, so they put green screen on her belly so they could remove the baby bump during post-production. I love it when the directors and producers put themselves in small cameo performances in their own films. In this case, producer Zack Snyder shows up as a World War I soldier. Did you know this movie has been banned in Lebanon? Gal Gadot is Israeli and even served in the military. Ah, romance. I love that both Diana and Steve learn from each other and make one another better. I wish I had one of those truth lassos. It was cool to see the symbolism of light and color illustrated in man's world and that of Themyscera. The soundtrack was noticeably good.Things I didn't like: There are a couple of long, explanatory scenes to help you understand what's going on. I wish Lynda Carter, the first TV Wonder Woman, could have made a cameo performance. Apparently, she sings in cabarets and couldn't fit it into her schedule. She definitely should have made the time for her fans. The villain was pretty weak.Interesting lines: 'You let this little thing tell you what to do?' – Diana/Wonder Woman talking about Chris Pine's watch. 'You know that if you choose to leave, you may never return.' – Hippolyta (Connie Nielsen) 'Who would I be if I stayed?' – Diana 'What kind of weapon kills innocents?' – Diana 'In this war, every kind.' – Steve Trevor * 'I believe in love.' - DianaFunny lines: 'How could a woman ever possibly fight in this?' – Diana 'Fight? We use our principles. Although, I'm not opposed to using fisty cuffs, should the need arise.' – Etta (Lucy Davis) 'Please put down the sword.' – Steve 'It doesn't go with the outfit.' – Etta 'Welcome to jolly 'ole London!' – Steve 'It's hideous!' – Diana 'Yeah, it's not for everyone.' – Steve 'You're a man.' – Diana 'Yeah. I mean, don't I look like one?' – Steve 'Stand back! Or maybe not.' – Steve 'I'm both frightened and aroused.' – Sameer (Said Taghmaoui) 'You should be very proud!' – Diana after she tastes a vendor's ice cream. I feel that way about great ice cream too. 'May we get what we want. May we get what we need. But may we never get what we deserve.' - men's toast at campfireTips for parents: You see a LOT of Chris Pinebare naked after a bath while he covers his junk with his hands. Lots of violence, destruction, and explosions. At 141 minutes, it's a long movie that a lot of little ones won't be able to sit through. In the comics, the war is WWII, but the director chose to highlight WWI in the movie. Parents might need to explain the differences between those two wars.",9,70,156,6 June 2017

Life," Suspense in Space
","Grade: B+Rating: R, 103 minutesIn a Nutshell: This is an extremely suspenseful and entertaining film that tries to straddle both the science fiction and horror genres. It presents an interesting 'what if' scenario that is fairly believable and realistic.The outstanding cast includes Jake Gyllenhaal, Ryan Reynolds, Hiroyuki Sanada, Rebecca Ferguson, Ariyon Bakare, and Olga Dihovichnaya.If you can't get enough of aliens, you'll be glad to know that Alien Covenant is coming out May 19 in the United States.Uplifting theme: 'Its curiosity outweighs fear.' – Hugh Derry (Ariyon Bakare) Life, survival, sacrifice, loyalty, friendship, curiosityThings I liked: The CGI is excellent. It definitely doesn't look like they put actors in front of a green screen. Everything is really believable. Named after Calvin Coolidge, the alien first elicits 'awww's' from the audience and then 'EEK!' You get to see plenty of the alien. My son's name is also Calvin, named after his grandfather and great-grandfather, who were also aliens. Just kiddingabout the alien part. There is an extremely impressive shot that is very long without cuts, showing the space station and the people working inside. The book Goodnight Moon book takes on new meaning when read while circling around the moon. Paul Wernick and Rhett Reese also wrote Deadpool and were happy to work with Ryan Reynolds again, who has all of the snappy one-liners in the flick. He was going to play the lead character, but his schedule conflicted with his role in the upcoming movie 'The Hit-man's Bodyguard', so he had to take a supporting role instead. This is also the second time Ryan Reynolds has worked with Director Daniel Espinosa (Safe House). By the way, have you seen the special, short clip of Deadpool before the movie Logan plays on screen in theaters? Hilarious. I'm always fascinated with how they make space movies and show actors almost swimming through the space station. I love it when items float in the air, especially tears. In the film you often see drops of blood float, symbolism the very essence of life.Things I didn't like: There are some really disgusting moments and super gory deaths that made the audience I sat with groan and moan. I really like Jake Gyllenhaal and find him almost mesmerizing to watch in all of his movies, but his character in this film seemed underdeveloped and one dimensional. Rumors have been swirling that this is a prequel for a future marvel 'Venom' movie. Nope. Not true, although it would be a good back story.Interesting lines: 'We're looking at the first proof of life before earth.' – Hugh Derry 'What I feel is not rational. It's not scientific. I feel hate.' – Miranda North (Rebecca Ferguson) 'No life support, no life.' – Hugh 'Life's existence requires destruction.' – Hugh 'Calvin doesn't hate us, but he has to kill us in order to survive.' – Hugh 'I can't stand what we do to each other down there.' – David Jordan (Jake Gyllenhaal) 'It's hard to watch people dielike fireworks.' - DavidFunny lines: 'Woo! Cue Instagram!' – Rory Adams (Ryan Reynolds) 'This is some re-animator shxx!' – Rory 'That's some kind of obscure reference!' – Miranda 'Not if you're a nerd.' – Rory 'Control, if you're listening and I know you are because you're creepy that way' – Rory 'Seriously, that kid had blue eyes.' – Rory 'It was all going so well.' – HughTips for parents:Profanity, including F-bombs Bloody, violent, gruesome deaths. The alien itself isn't that scary looking. It kind of looks like an octopus in the end.",8,10,24,25 March 2017

Based on the first book in Area X: The Southern Reach Trilogy: Annihilation; Authority; Acceptance , Director Alex Garland decided not to make the film an adaptation, but a 'dream of the book.' Like most dreams, this film feels incomplete and somewhat unsatisfying in the end.Critics seem to be falling all over themselves with this movie, but the audience I sat with hated it. Some people saw that I was writing notes for a review, so when we walked out, they asked me what I thought. More importantly, I asked THEM what THEY thought. One guy shouted, 'It sucked!' Several admitted they were disappointed and felt they had just wasted 2 hours of their lives. They were mostly guys looking for a sci-fi action flick like Alien. The good thing was that audience members wanted to TALK about it. I love that.The best description I've heard of this film is 'sci-fi modern art.' It's one of those polarizing movies that some people will love and others will hate. Tips for parents: 
Some bloody, gory, disgusting deaths.
Tons of F-bombs and profanity.
Twice you see the naked back side of Natalie Portman while she's having sex. 
Marital infidelity.
Creepy skeletons.
Uplifting theme: 
Humanity
Resistance to change
Trust
 Things I liked:
I adore Natalie Portman. She is both beauty and brains.
There is a similar scene in this movie that made Sigourney Weaver famous in Alien, where she is side-by-side with a sharp-toothed monster. Viewers who are expecting the entire movie to be another Alien will be disappointed.
It was good to see Jennifer Jason Leigh in something again, although it annoyed me that she was always playing with something between her fingers in the first half of the movie.
There are mostly women in the movie and they all do a great job. 
Director Alex Garland also did Ex Machina, so people were really expecting elevated material from him. He is great at providing social commentary and getting audiences to think.
Beautiful, delicate, colorful images. The 'shimmer' is beautiful to look at and definitely creates that dream-like feeling that the director was going for. The environments are an interesting hybrid of heaven and hell.
I have really enjoyed Gina Rodriguez in Jane the Virgin: Season 1 and she does a great job in this film. What I didn't enjoy is that she drops F-bombs almost every time she opens her mouth. We get it...you're tough now.
Surprisingly, this movie is going to be released on Netflix outside of the USA shortly after the USA theater release.
The musical score is noticeably good. 
 
Things I didn't like:
It is no Arrival. I loved that movie for so many reasons. That's a movie that was expertly crafted to REALLY make you think. You can read my movie review of Arrival here.
There were moments when I was actually bored. It's a slow burn for sure.
Extremely cliched, disappointing ending.
I felt like I was watching a frustrating episode of Lost - The Complete First Season where a lot of questions are presented with no answers.
The film goes back and forth in time, which could be confusing and frustrating for some people.
When are people ever going to learn that it's not wise to go off alone in a , unknown territory?
 
Interesting lines:
'It's destroying everything.' - Dr. Ventress (Jennifer Jason Leigh)
'It's not destroying. It's making something new.' - Lena (Natalie Portman)
'God doesn't make mistakes. It's pretty much key to the whole God thing.' - Kane (Oscar Isaac)
'Soldier scientist. You can fight. You can learn. You can save him.' - Dr. Ventress
'Almost none of us commits suicide. Almost all of us self-destruct in some way or another.' - Dr. Ventress",7,12,25,24 February 2018
Alien: Covenant," Insightful symbolism
","Grade: B+Rating: R, 120 minutesIn a Nutshell: This is a sequel to the movie Prometheus, and a prequel to the original blockbuster movie Alien. Directed by the brilliant Ridley Scott, this new addition to the Alien franchise will leave fans entertained and satisfied. It's not just a fun Sci-Fi thriller, but has a lot of very deep and symbolic insights.Uplifting theme: Love vs. duty Creation, humanity 'The only question that matters: where do we come from?' – Peter Weyland (Guy Pearce) Why wasn't he credited in the film? 'I think if we are kind, it will be a kind world.' - DavidThings I liked: The spaceship is called the 'Covenant.' Look for other symbolism associated with the word covenant and its deeper meaning. The first thing you see is Michael Fassbender's artificial blue, dreamy eye. He does a fantastic job as two characters. It's helpful that he speaks in a British accent when he is David and an American accent when he's Walter, so that you can tell who is who. The androids' names (David & Walter) are a tribute to producers David Giler and Walter Hill. SPOILER: He fights and even kisses himself. Ha ha Michael Fassbender was able to take time off of filming in Australia in order to attend the premiere for X-Men: Apocalypse. Beautiful images. There is a lot of CGI, but an impressive amount of shots are taken in camera. David plays Das Rheingold: Entry of the Gods Into Valhalla on the piano, which is a perfect choice to illustrate the theme of creation. I thought the 'energy sails' were super cool looking on the space ship. Katherine Waterston does a great job as Daniels. Her short hair is perfect in this role, but I wish she had longer hair in her role in Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them. You get to see a lot of aliens/xenomorphs. SPOILER: If you're hoping for the classic scene of an Alien coming out of someone's chest, you won't be disappointed. Added bonus: one comes out of someone's back side. The aliens aren't the only monsters in the movie. Some questions that were left dangling in the movie Prometheus, get answered in this movie. Creepy ending. Look for Easter eggs from the previous films. For example, there is a small toy bird in this and the original Alien Some of the lines are the same, like 'I got you, you son of a B' The music that David plays on the flute is the same score that's played in Prometheus. I love little details. For example, the date of the mission, shown at the beginning of the film, is December 5, which is the birthday of Walt Disney. One of the android's names is Walter. The movie was originally going to be called 'Paradise Lost', referring to John Milton's poem where Lucifer claims it is 'better to reign in Hell than serve in Heaven.' The movie poster has an almost old, religious gargoyle feel to it, which is appropriate considering the religious themes of covenant and creation throughout the entire movie.Things I didn't like: Some choppy editing. There are many times when you wonder, 'What the heck is going on?' because there is some bouncing back and forth in time. The tone shifts and seems inconsistent. If you haven't seen Alien or Prometheus, you might be a bit confused at times. Why would such an important mission send so many young girls who scream and fall apart so easily? Oh yeah, they're good-looking.Funny lines: 'I don't kid about John Denver.' – Tennessee (Danny McBride)Interesting lines: 'What do you believe in, David?' – Oram (Billy Crudup) 'Creation.' – David 'If you created me, who created you?' – David 'I will serve you. You are human; I am not. You will die; I will not.' – David 'Seven bells and all is well.' – Mother (computer)Tips for parents: This is definitely a rated R reason for all of the appropriate reasons: nudity, violence, horror. Most of the aliens are really scary looking. There are two people in a shower naked. You see the woman's bare chest. Katherine Waterston doesn't wear a bra. Lots of profanity and F-bombs. You see a burned body up close and lots of other dead bodies in various stages of decomposition. Bloody, violent, gory deaths.MOVIE REVIEW MOM@trinaboice",8,12,21,25 May 2017
