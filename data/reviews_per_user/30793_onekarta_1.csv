Catch Me If You Can," Janusz Kaminski
","The cinematography was so well done by Janusz Kaminski.  In almost every scene, the light streaming in through the windows or the flare around lights gave the movie a dreamy, fairy-tale-like quality.  Along with the campy music and the bright and colorful costumes and scenery, it rounded out the film's light-hearted view of this story.  Kaminski did this in A.I. as well, though the effect was much less light-hearted, but still wistful and poetic. Although I like this effect, I hope it doesn't become a Janusz Kaminski trademark, like John Woo and his doves.",Null,0,0,30 December 2002
