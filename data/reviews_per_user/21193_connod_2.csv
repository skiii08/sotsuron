Minority Report," Great Movie Despite Plot Gaps
","I really enjoyed this movie!  Anderton had depth as cop of the future.  I liked that we got to hear about his son and his wife - not just a 'knock 'em / sock 'em' role.  Yes, there were unanswered questions and predictable parts in the plot, however, I think the action moved so quick that it really did hold your attention despite these things and leave you with the feeling of a having seen a great movie when you're done.  The effects and creativity used to depict the future were awesome and thought provoking.**SPOILERS** Having said that, some questions I wish they had answered include: (1) Is his son alive to fulfill Agatha's vision or not? (2) Did Anderton go blind in his left eye from the spider's scan 6 hours after the surgery? (3)When Lara called the office for a favor, how did she know the precogs would be seeing the vision to download and immediately send over? and (4) Why can't the precogs know addresses?  Their visions include fronts of homes, streets, parks, etc.  The visions don't have any clues toward names, but yet they come up with those instead - and spelled 100% correctly so that they can be verified via IRS /DMV Registration records.  All that and no address?  *END OF SPOILERS*Still I would say - go see the movie.  It's one of the best this year!",Null,0,0,13 August 2002
Brave," Really enjoyed this movie!
","I really do not understand some of the extreme negative reviews for this movie. It's NOT Finding Nemo, and I do get the concept that it's more like Disney than Pixar, but I still really enjoyed seeing it!I loved the mother/daughter theme the most. I grew up with a very controlling mother who had an agenda for my life, so I totally related to Merida's frustration, drives and strong feelings. I cried when they had their blow-out fight and I cried again at the end to see the resolution. I found the mom hilarious after the spell when she keeps trying to be all proper and modest, even though it's impossible for her character to do that.I like that Pixar created a female lead who has strength, but also compassion and remorse for her wrong choices. I really enjoyed Merida's speech to the clans and appreciated her character development to see beyond herself. I thought her growth was a good model for teenage girls who may resent their parents at times, but learn to reconcile and love them in the end. It was very touching when Merida realizes that her mother was right about a lot of things. It's more common in real life to come full circle and learn, than it is to just obey and do everything right all along. Even in real life, I don't think there has ever been a hero that did not go through tragic circumstances of some form. Courage does not grow from a soft life.I enjoyed the humor of the triplet brothers and the clan leaders/sons. I'm part Scottish, so I'm also glad to see a movie that shows the beauty of Scotland. The animation of the highlands and surrounding areas was breathtaking. The soundtrack was awesome. I love Celtic music and it was a treat to hear the penny whistles and bagpipes. The audience applauded at the end and it was great to be in a crowd that enjoyed it, tooLastly, stay for the bonus scene after the credits! Most people left the theater. It's not spectacular, but just good fun! I would have preferred to see Merida on a goofy 1st date or something like that more...BUT I still enjoyed it!",8,13,23,22 June 2012
