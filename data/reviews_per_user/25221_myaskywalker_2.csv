First Man," Great, Not Perfect.
","The first thing you need to know before seeing this movie is, this is the story about the first man that landed on the moon, this is not the story about the landing itself. The movie starts right before Armstrong loose's his daughter and from that on it shows the situations he had to overcome to be on the moon. He was modest and quiet, not a showman, so this is not a super fast full of explosions movie, it's a character movie. The story has its faults, sometimes the movie suffers from the pace of the story, it feels like something it's missing, but not the flag bull***t, something about the context of the story itself.
It's a beautifully crafted movie to be screened on IMAX, with a perfect soundtrack and sound effects, the main actors did a masterful job in being the everyday people that they were.
An excellent movie for people that care about the history of mankind, this is not a Michael Bay's movie.",9,1,3,19 December 2018
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Why should you watch Phantom Menace.
","In spite of being consider the worst movie on the Star Wars series, Phantom Menace is actually a very beautiful and poetic composition, perfect for children. Create to entertain and explain how someone sweet can became one of the biggest villains of movie history. It also explain the beginning of the downfall of a great society.It is a movie for hopeful and kind eyes, not middle-age fanatics stuck in the past.It has all George Lucas movie idiosyncrasy:repeated lines; beautiful scenery; impeccable art production and robotic performances. Very cool!",9,5,7,17 May 2015
