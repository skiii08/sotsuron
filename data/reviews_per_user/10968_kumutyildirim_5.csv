Skyfall," Fall From Sky
","What was this? A James Bond movie?.Did i watch the same movie as the people giving 10 stars? No plot, no action, no acting, full o clichés.It was boring.Evereyone in the theater was checking time from their cell phones because everyone was bored to death.Sorry Sam Mendes if you are shooting a 2,5 hours movie you either must have a very good story or you must make an action packed and visually stunning movie.Non of these exists in this movie.One of the worst bond movies i ever seen.And regarding the rating system of IMDb; it is very misleading.Some awful movies get very high ratings, ,i don't know the reason for that but i think something is terribly wrong with the rating system.",1,27,61,5 November 2012
Spider-Man: Homecoming," Wait What?
",Wait what?I thought that spiderman's super powers came from his own body.Not a fancy suit made by Tony Stark. Am i wrong? Did i missed something?How is spiderman different from iron man than?Chemistry between Peter Parker and his girl friend is non existent.There is no character development what so ever.And what's with this in your face Hollywood diversity thing?,5,9,13,2 October 2017
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," lots of plot holes
","Things i don't understand:1- How can a rebel cruiser destroy first order star destroyer by jumping to light speed.If it is possible than you can destroy all first order fleet by remote controlled ships.
2-How did Finn and Rose made it to the cave after rose saved Finn from death bey crashing him with hear flying motorcycle? I remember they were very far away from the gate of the cave and they did not have any vehicle.
3- How did Snoke did not sense that Kylo Ren was moving the light saber?",5,22,39,14 December 2017
The Conjuring," Just Another Exorcism Movie
","Let me summarize this movie for you and you will understand:-Invisible beings behind doors -Bruises appear on characters from nowhere -Stange sounds come from the house -Invisible beings slams the doors -One of the child character sees those beings and no one believes her -Furniture move by themselves -Balls rolling on the floor -Disfigured and rotten faced girl attack -Clocks stop at a certain time -Creepy music box -Exorcism -possesion by a demonOK just tell me which one of those you didn't see before.Full of clichés, i didn't find any part of the movie creative or scary.If you want a good movie just watch the original exorcist and it will scare you out of your mind.",1,25,50,12 November 2013
Lucy," Complete Mess
",I think that movie makers are running out of ideas.All the good stories has been filmed and its very hard to come out with an original idea.Take Lucy for example.Its been based on a completely hoax idea of that humans are using only % 10 of their brains.Its been proved that we use every bit of our brain.The brain consumed % 20 of the energy while is only % 3 of body weight. Its evolutionary impossible for this to happen.For the movie its a complete nonsense from beginning to end.It doesn't make any sense.Luc Besson are you the same person who directed Leon.I cant believe its the same person,2,1,5,1 December 2014
