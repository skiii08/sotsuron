The Monuments Men," I love you guys, but leave this one to The History Channel.
","I'm glad my Art History professors weren't as preachy as the always gorgeous George Clooney. It would've been a very long semester. So much wrongly used talent here, there wasn't enough humor or action to warrant the big screen. It's an interesting story that The History Channel or PBS could of done justice. P.S. Henry Fonda and Lucille Ball called, they want the music from Yours, Mine, and Ours back. With that being said, it held my attention and wasn't the complete borefest others have attested to. Kudos for shining a light on this chapter of history, and that art is life. Creativity and beauty have their rightful place in history alongside the battles and oppression usually depicted on film. Next time George just make it a little flashier, you're on the big screen after all.",4,0,1,19 March 2014
