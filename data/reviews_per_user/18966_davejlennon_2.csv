Black Swan," Black Swan - Pure Rubbish
",OK so I was forced to go see this film with my girlfriend. That's a given in my situation. I choose a film to see and next time my girlfriend chooses. Fair is fair.I watched a trailer to this and figured it would be kind of a crazed serial killer/ murder movie. Was I wrong! A load of ballet dancing and men in tights. This film tries so hard to be arty that it comes off as being full of itself.A weak plot that takes so long to unravel you almost go insane. Looking around the theater I noticed one other guy. An old man with his wife. Same look on his face as I did. Other than him it was old lesbians and rich looking hags all around.If your a male who likes male things and isn't at all interested in ballet skip this load of tripe of a film. An hour and a half of a little rich girl crying and whining and dancing around. Blah blah. Not even a boob in this film.Its a yawn fest.Dave,1,4,14,18 February 2011
Independence Day," THis film is my comfort blanket, along with star wars
","I ;love this movie. Its not to be taken too serious but its a whole load of fun. From the get go its ALIENS!!!! and then its ALIENS Attack!!! Fun fun fun. Oh and the Area 51 part is great too. Will smith is perfect and Jeff Goldblum is his usual self.Did you know that the US military were going to supply all the army tanks, uniforms, and guns but pulled out when the director refused to cut the Area 51 part of the movie??? hmmmm interesting.Critics slam this film but its just a fun movie and you can watch it with the kids. A bit of violence but no blood of guts.If your bored and the weather is bad, stay in and watch this movie. Oh and it's fantastic on blu-ray too enjoy....",8,3,5,18 February 2011
