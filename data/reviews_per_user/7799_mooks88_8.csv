Iron Man 3," Absolutely awesome!
","A great fresh look into iron man following iron man 2 and the avengers. Following on post-avengers, the story is a lot darker and shows more depth into the character of Stark - Downey Jr does an AWESOME job at this.If you're looking at pure iron man kicking ass, its not what you expect, as there is a lot of back storyline behind tony and the other characters. Great action scenes though as usual! There is one action scene...where you just smile at how cool it is!!!Special effects are amazing as well, and if you see the movie in 3d it makes things come alive. Gwenyth Paltrow does an excellent job as Pepper Potts and Guy Pierce plays a surprising role...Great movie!",10,6,22,29 April 2013
Star Trek Into Darkness," Simply Amazing!
","I've seen this movie in the cinemas about three times! Watching it in IMAX 3D was mind blowing! Great graphics and awesome on screen chemistry between the cast...I cant wait for number three! Compared to the first star trek, they have really improved some of the CGI work and the enterprise star ship looks incredible. Also you get more of a look at some of the non-space areas such as London.The storyline was much better than the first one; much deeper and there is more character relationship development in comparison to the first movie. JJ Abrams has done a great job at putting the movie together. It starts well, ends well, and doesn't drop a beat throughout the whole movie.Go and see it!",9,1,2,27 June 2013
Fast & Furious 6," Awesome!
","Watched it 4 times already! Fast and furious 6 is equal with fast and furious one (fast 1 would only win because when it came out it was new and cool). The fast and furious franchise has, since number 4, improved dramatically in terms of screenplay, quality of acting, storyline and action sequences!The coming together of the team again together with 'The Rock' Dwayne Johnson, really brings the chemistry of the team to another level. Watching Brian and Dom work together to run the team works so well, and each team member really brings in a special element that they can add to the team.The return of Letty to the franchise also helps to complete this and is good to see her character return to the story!Fast Cars, Amazing Soundtracks, Awesome Stunts and action sequences, overflowing testosterone and classic one liners really make fast and furious 6 the great movie that it is! 10 out of 10!Make sure you wait until the end of the credits!There's a reason why this movie was number one in the world for two weeks!",10,3,7,27 June 2013
Pacific Rim," Surprisingly Good
","I went into the cinema to watch this with not much expectations - i figured that it was simply another 'epic' sci fi movie with big robots and b grade actors...However, while the list of actors wasn't the worlds most famous, they held up pretty well and delivered the story quite well - albeit a few corny lines, which i thought probably needed to be in there to cater to a wide variety of audiences! So tick off the list!Big robots? The trailer made me thing of the Japanese anime gundam had come to life, and in all honesty, it pretty much did! The graphics, which apparently were 2-3 years ahead of their time and where the majority of the budget obviously was spent, was incredible. The detail was magnificent and each mech was well designed and not over the top! Technology that existed in the movie was really amazing and fitting for the time the movie was based!Sci-Fi Epic? Well the movie has several international locations, huge man made mechas with guns, armour and the like, invading alien species and amazing special effects? Its a pretty damn good movie!",8,3,9,16 July 2013
Man of Steel," Great new look superman
","Man of Steel is a new look on the classic story of superman! Throughout the whole movie, the characters and story keep the audience engaged through thrilling action sequences, character development and some slight comedy.The casting director did a good job in finding fresh faces for the new look superman, while keeping things similar to previous versions. A revamped look into the world of krypton was amazing and really does help set the tone, as well as back story for Clark Kent aka Kal-El aka Superman!It definitely was a darker version of the story, but this allowed more depth for the development of Clark as a Human, and I feel the movie focused more on these parts slightly more than other movies - which simply concentrate on supermans powers. The development of clark's super powers was not as in depth as other movies.Visual effects were stunning. Aside from the planet krypton, the movie modernizes supermans superpowers, using the latest visual technology. 3D viewing would be recommended!Overall the movie was quite good, it had good visuals, a deeper storyline and also great action sequences. Russel Crowe does a good job appearing here and there to help tell the story and give it some depth. I rate this movie at an 8/10! Not bad at all :)",8,3,9,7 July 2013
Now You See Me," Look too closely and you wont see the big picture!
","'Now you See Me' is an excellent modern day take at an 'Oceans 11' style, mastermind type movie. It is also unique in that not many films (that I am aware of) feature the criminals as master magicians and tricksters!Each character uses a specific skill set that aids the team in different ways. For example there is an illusionist, a magician, a trickster/pickpocket and a mentalist. Each character has some development and background throughout the movie, however the character with the most depth would be the FBI agent who chases them around the globe to stop their crimes and arrest them!The scenes where the 'magic' is performed, is absolutely breathtaking. Thanks to the use of high end CGI sequences, the stunts and tricks are added with just that extra touch of glamour and 'wow' value. Scenic areas are appropriately chosen and show a diverse visual range.The plot, while as simple as it sounds, also has a few tricks up its sleeve and provides an ample level of depth, obviously not as in depth as a movie you might study in high school English class (like inception or the matrix), but nonetheless it is sufficient. I only found there was one or two parts which i was a tad iffy about.All in all, the movie hits the spot and is a breath of fresh air from sci-fi, action and teen-drama type movies that tend to dominate the screens these days (although I am a fan of several of those)!. The movie is definitely recommended and you probably wont be disappointed!",8,1,5,20 August 2013
Guardians of the Galaxy," One of the best marvel films
","After watching every marvel feature film as of recent times, including all captain America, iron man, Thor and avenger movies, I must say that guardians of the galaxy is a breath of fresh air!It is the perfect combination of drama, action, comedy and coolness! Each character lends perfectly to the team, rather than trying to dominate it (as you see in a way with avengers) and also gets to tell a bit of a story with their background and allows you to relate and connect with them to understand how they got to be who they are at the time of the movie. While I haven't seen the actual comics for these characters, from a movie point of view, I felt each character had enough depth and would be well received by different demographics in the audience - i could hear the laugher from the rest of the crowd.The other thing that was great if you are a fan of the marvel movies is the links to its other films and other random things. While I can tell you how amazing the action and graphics were - which of course they were since its a marvel film..! It was at the subtle little hints that gets thrown around regarding other characters and story arcs in the marvel universe! Featuring a decent case - and Bautista can actually act! I've got to say that this is definitely up there with one of the best marvel films to date!!",10,1,5,1 August 2014
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Worth the wait!!!
","For one of the most anticipated movies of all time its quite hard not to get overly excited for the newest edition for the Star Wars universe!With JJ Abrams at the helm of the latest release and with the majority of the original cast returning, there are ridiculously high bars set for this one - and understandably so!JJ does a great job at not going too over the top with graphics, instead opting for realistic props, characters and worlds. Nevertheless it is inevitable that some computer graphics are used - and there a quite a few new tricks that we have never seen in the Star Wars universe that get put into great effect in this release! I must say that whilst some people speculated that this would be a movie purely of lens flares...they have been mistaken. There is and will never be nothing like the opening credits which take us through what has happened over the last 30 years. A hotly debated and anticipated plot revealed, I think that they have done exactly what has been needed. Something new, together with something old - and nothing of something stupid.Having some of the original cast together with some great new talent really refreshed the story and helped to breathe fresh life into the franchise that we all love and care about.As I don't really believe in spoilers, I will simply say this - if you have (as I have) been CRAZY in wait for this movie and can't think of a better thing happening in your life... or if you are a low-mid level star wars fan, or even if you are new to the franchise - I think JJ has done a great job with Star Wars: The Force Awakens as there is something that will appeal to all members of the audience - whether you know any of the original story or not. You will not leave this movie feeling dissatisfied with all of the hype, media and the personal feelings of ultra-excitement that has surrounded it. In fact, at a bare minimum I would say I walked away thinking - now that, was worth the wait, worth the price and worth my time. If you walk away from this movie unsatisfied you have probably tried to look too far into this with plot lines and an already sour taste from the prequels (if you disliked them). If you are not a fan and didn't like all the excitement then I would ask - why did you even go and see the movie? You could have left a seat for somebody who would have appreciated the artwork that has been put together!All in all, this is as a standalone movie - very solid. As part of the new trilogy - an excellent platform, and as part of the Star Wars Universe - a fresh, new and exciting addition. Well done to JJ Abrams and to all the cast and crew for once again, bringing all of the ideals and emotions you can expect with a real Star Wars movie - plus a couple of new tricks!",10,14,44,19 December 2015
