Vertigo," love and distorted obsession

However, he falls in love with the woman, but she dies, so he he starts to make another woman the woman. I was little scared with the scene that the man brings a woman who resembles to his died lover to a convent that is a place where she dies. I can feel his mad thought from the scene that he makes her wear the died lover's dress and he makes her hair dye in the color of his died lover before. However, his bizarre thought is at peak then.I can understand that how important the died lover is for him from his expressions and actions, but I was horrified with the excessive actions. I was also surprised oh the big differences between the former part and the latter part. I think this movie is a romance story, but this movie focuses on on the dispread love after she dies. I like this movie because I can enjoy the transition of the man's feelings.",Null,0,0,9 August 2017
Requiem for a Dream," the danger of drugs
","Thsi movie is about a mother and a son who always use stimulant drugs. It is decided that the mother appears on a TV show, so she decides to lose her weight. When she hears about the medicine losing weight easily, she starts to drink it, but it is a drug. The son always use drugs, and he tries to sell the drug with his friend. This movie shows a lot of realistic scenes. For example, the son amputates his left arm, and blood splatters on his face. Besides, the mother is given electric shocks to treat the addiction to drugs. I think these scenes are effective to show drugs are dangerous and we should not use it, but I cannot forget them because of the shock. I was also impressed with the scene that she has a hallucination. As hallucination escalates, her mental goes collapsed. Her confusion and horror expressions convey the danger and risk of drugs. I do not like this movie because I cannot feel well when I watched it. However, it is important to know drugs make our life break. This movie is a good example to tell it. I will never use drugs, but I was very scared that my friends use it and break their lives. I think this movie is very realistic, so it makes me think so.",Null,0,0,10 August 2017
The Revenant," hatred
","This movie is about a man who is attacked by a bear and cannot move by himself because of injury in a forest. A party is on the way to a camp, so he is left by the companions. Furthermore, his son killed by a cunning man. The theme of this movie is hatred. I was very impressed with the scene that the man tries to make his son eat some food, but then his son passes away. This scene conveys his feeling that he would nit like to admit his son died to me deeply from his frustrated expression. From this scene, the man's hatred feeling becomes bigger, so it is very important turning point in this movie. I was also shocked with the scene that he is attacked by a bear and he prevents from cold inside a horse. The attack scene is very terrible, so I cannot look straight at it. I also cannot enter the horse inside to beat because the horse is just dead.Tyese scenes are very long and realistic, so it make me more horrible. I do not like this movie because this movie is very shocking and cruel, so a Lott of scenes makes my eyes close. However, I can understand his hatred is natural from many scenes. I like the ending of this movie because first he tries to kill a man who kills his son, but finally he does not do that.",Null,0,0,8 August 2017
La La Land," attractive dance and music
","This movie is about a romance story between a man and a woman. A man would like to own his bar which he can play jazz music as he likes. He meets a woman who would like to be an actress in a jazz bar. First, they do not like each other, but a closer relationship between them is brought by a common hobby. I like a lot of dancing and singing scenes, especially 'A lovely Night'. This scene has a singing part in the former half and a dancing part in the latter half. They say 'you are not type for me' and 'Our relationship never becomes a romance' to each other, so I can understand they do not like one another. However, I am fascinating of their harmonious tap dance as I do not feel they do not like each other. I am impressed with the first scene that many people dance in a highway, First, I do not think this scene is related to the story, but it is the important scene that the man and encounters the woman. The song and dance are so attractive , so I think it is a good introduction. I can enjoy the process of developing their love, and music and dance. I cannot expect the ending, but I like this movie as I bought a sound track CD.",10,3,5,8 August 2017
