Source Code," Bad. Terrible. Awful. Repugnant. Unacceptable. Stupid.
","OK so Gyllenhal is good in this movie. Lets get that out of the way first. Now onto the roast.What a terrible steaming pile of dung this movie is. It simply makes NO sense. Lets examine the two possibilities for the 'world' that they are operating in.In the first, they have developed code that allows them to put a person's consciousness into the body of someone else in a mock-up of the world as it was at that time an infinite number of times. Fine - Where did this mock-up come from? They implied that it was from the the guy who Gyllenhal is inhabiting, but the train exploded... his brain would be peanut butter (along with everyone else on that train). OK so lets say magically his head got tossed away from the train and they retrieved it, how exactly does this guy manage to have complete knowledge of everything that exists in that world? He didn't go into the bathroom and open the ceiling and find the bomb there, so there would be nothing there in his version of the world. He either got off the train or stayed on it, so there's no way he could know what happened after the point that the train moved on. He might continue to believe that the Middle- Eastern stereotype guy was the terrorist - there's no way he could have any knowledge of what happened after those two events diverged. So of course, the virtual world example is ridiculous and makes no sense.Alright so what about the idea that it is an alternate reality? This is even harder to believe. If its an alternate reality then of course there is no way to believe that the events would have unfolded in the same way as in the reality the movie takes place in. Every alternate would be different and none would reliably provide information about the reality of the movie. The guy that Gyllenhal 'inhabits' maybe doesn't even exist in the alternate reality. Maybe he died of cancer. Maybe he works in Japan. Maybe he called in sick today. Who knows???If its a virtual construct then all the information is already there, just parse the data. If its an alternate reality then by the definition of the word ALTERNATE you can't rely on it being even marginally similar to your reality. And if its time travel you could literally send him back an infinite number of times in succession. Just by the odds you would eventually get the data you needed by reading his brain (which is silly by itself, don't get me started...)And then there is the annoying obfuscation that moves the plot along but is entirely unnecessary for the movie. There's no need to hide facts from Gyllenhal's character -- Just tell him what he's doing! There's no need to get his permission -- Just send him back! Why the writers play these stupid games with their audience I haven't a clue.Stop being stupid movie-going zombies! Be critical! Ask questions!If you keep consuming this kind of crap and saying its a filet mignon, the studios will continue to feed you CRAP.",2,80,163,21 June 2011
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," Forrest Gump in reverse
","This. Movie. Was. Terrible.It was quite literally Forrest Gump with a change of disabilities.In it, we follow Forre.. er.. I mean Benjamin as he experiences his life in reverse. It is, of course, full of fantastical occurrences that most compilations of 20 men wouldn't meet in their lifetimes, but of course, Forrest (oops I did it again, I mean Benjamin!) just manages to fall ass-backwards into every piece of luck he possibly can. Father is a millionaire -- Here take all this free money!Its full of stereotypes -- The cruel white businessman who doesn't accept his son because of his appearance, the elegant and beautiful mother dying during childbirth, the loving black mammy taking in the unwanted child, the hard-working and stressed out surrogate father asking 'Why are we taking care of someone else's child?!?', the neglected, spoiled businesswoman jumping in bed with Benjamin as much to punish her husband as because of her desire to be with Benjamin, and the oft-returning love interest that's made a family for herself but never stopped loving! Oh! So original! If you can't piece this film together yourself from about 3 or 4 other better films then.. well.. you just haven't seen enough movies in your life.Watch a couple of good films and don't waste your time on this one.",1,5,10,21 June 2011
The Legend of 1900," Worst Movie of All Time? Maybe not, but close.
","Watching the film 'The Legend of 1900' is by definition a trial of patience. Every aspect of the movie strains believably to its breaking point, to such an extent that you wish to watch a movie like 'Star Wars', just so you can watch a movie without having to question the silliness of everything that happens.Like many movies that feature phenomenal music, not-so-bright people mistake that music for a quality movie. That is a shame. The music truly is exceptional, and is one of only two redeeming aspects of the film. The other is the acting of Tim Roth, who desperately attempts to pull this movie out of the depths it is falling into. But unfortunately, all of his acting chops cannot save this movie.The movie falls apart quickly - the eye-rolling begins at the beginning, with the unlikely discovery of the baby, and quickly turns to out-and- out groans when we find that the child has the magical ability to play the piano at a professional level without ever having touched the instrument or having been given any introduction to music, chord structure, formal training or any other aptitude building of any kind. Since the movie is built on this concept, everything that follows lacks any punch since none of it is in any way believable. By the time 1900 and Max are sliding around on the ballroom floor during a huge storm while deftly playing the piano, you'll likely have realized that this movie is pure silliness. That stuff works in anime movies, but not in films like this where the audience really needs to believe that the events depicted could have happened.The movie isn't helped by the terrible, terrible acting of much of the supporting cast. The awful Pruitt Taylor Vince hams it up to the best of his (meager) abilities, and every scene he appears is dragged down into boredom, eye-rolling, and laugh-inducing dialogue. I guess its no surprise when the co-star of the films only other notable role was as a patient on 'House'. Other than Clarence Williams III as 'Jelly Roll' Morton, and Bill Nunn as 1900's adoptive father, there's really no other actors to speak of anyways (and applying that term to anyone in the film other than Roth is a stretch, to say the least).If you're able to stick this terrible movie out to the ending, you will have progressively been deadened time and again by the schlocky, pointless, unbelievable story to the point that the final ridiculous scene won't even surprise you much. Although when you think back on it, you'll find yourself chuckling to yourself and wondering what you were thinking by not turning it off earlier. And that's really where we get in this movie - Nowhere. Turn it off before it starts and you'll be happier.So its maybe not the worst movie of all time, there are movies like 'Plan 9' and 'DeathBed' which deserve that title more. But when a movie takes itself so seriously and comes off so pretentiously, as '1900' is wont to do, you really want to rank it below the movies that are worse, if only to punish it for its excesses. Watch something more believable, like 'Men in Black', or 'Spy Kids'... or even 'Cars'. The idea of talking cars is so much more believable than this tripe.",1,9,34,21 June 2011
