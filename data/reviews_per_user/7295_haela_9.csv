Mission: Impossible III," Intense, exciting, and very well acted...so under-rated!
","Tom Cruise returns as Ethan Hunt in the hugely underrated third Mission: Impossible movie. This is one of the best action movies I have seen a long time, and it's hard for me to believe that it doesn't even reach a 7.0 rating on IMDb..the only reason I can think of for this is that it was released at a time when Tom Cruise was unpopular, to say the least.Having retired from field work, Ethan Hunt is trying to live a normal life with his sweetheart. But when one of his best trainees is captured during active duty, he agrees to attempt the rescue, and comes into contact with a ruthless, brutal, sadistic arms dealer, Owen Davien, who soon forms a personal vendetta with Hunt. He tracks Ethan down to hurt him in the best way he knows how: by hurting the person Ethan loves best. Davien gives Ethan 48 hours to recover a mysterious and powerful object code named the 'Rabbit's Foot', and states that if he does not recover it, his wife will die. Falsely accused and wanted back in the United States, he rushes to the Far East in a desperate attempt to save his wife.M:I:III included the by-now-expected array of guns, gadgets, explosions, and fistfights, but what stuck with me afterwards, was the tense, suspenseful drive of the film, and the spectacular acting. Starting with the ominous, terrifying foreshadowing scene of our hero being helplessly tortured both mentally and physically, this film grabbed me and never let go. Tom Cruise went above and beyond my (high) expectations, Phillip Seymour Hoffman was brilliant, and half a dozen new arrivals not only pulled their weight, but excelled.Highly recommended...enjoy!",9,1,2,24 August 2012
Minority Report," Sci-fi, crime thriller, and drama blend effortlessly in this Cruise/Spielberg masterpiece.
","John Anderton is head of the Pre-Crime division, a police operation that has virtually eliminated murder. There are three gifted humans who can 'see' the murder before it takes place, allowing a select team to arrive at the site and prevent it from happening. John believes in the system, and when it is brought into question, prepares to defend it.'The system is perfect. It's never wrong. Until it comes at you.'Until John is tagged for the murder of a man he has never met, never even heard of. Faced with immediate arrest before he has even done anything, John chooses to run instead. 'Everybody runs.'And strikes out on a last-ditch effort to prove his innocence, and find out who set him up. And just maybe, what happened to his child who was murdered only six months before the Pre-Crime division was activated.'You still have a choice. Like I did.'Done in a style all its own,Minority Report is suspenseful, involving, and quietly graceful. Tom Cruise delivers a fine performance, portraying Anderton's anger, relentlessness and toughness, shot through with vulnerability and a crippling sorrow. It also had an irresistibly dark tone, shot almost entirely in blues, greens, and greys. Then there was the masterfully constructed plot, and unerring judgment that kept the suspense going. I highly recommend this film, and hope you enjoy it.'You still have a choice.'",9,0,0,1 October 2012
Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters," What can I say? You get what you paid for.
","The bad news: it's a shallow, outrageous, horror/comedy/fantasy mashup.The good news: You get exactly what you paid for.Jeremy Renner and Gemma Arterton are Hansel and Gretel, a young brother and sister who are abandoned by their father in a woods, only to stumble upon a witch living in a house made of candy. Ganging up on her, the youngsters shove her into an oven, and thus defeat her. After this youthful encounter, they devoted their lives to tracking down and killing witches. If a village had a 'witch problem', the standard solution would be to hire Hansel and Gretel...basically, they are supernatural bounty hunters. It doesn't take long to see that this movie isn't serious (for instance, when Gretel threatens to shoot somebody and 'blow his brains all over you f****** hillbillies'), and it doesn't get much better. Blood, guts, and brains are the preferred special effects, corny jokes and stylized poses and fights are in every other scene. One scene where a mildly wounded Hansel is coaxed into 'healing waters' by a good witch amounts to an excuse to see Jeremy Renner naked.It's violent, irreverent, thoughtless, and yet I enjoyed it. If you're expecting a fairy tale, don't watch it. If you're expecting any kind of depth, don't watch it. If you're squeamish, don't watch it. But if all you're looking for is a couple hours of entertainment from a popcorn flick and you don't have anything better to do, this is an acceptable option.",5,2,4,24 February 2013
Mission: Impossible II," Tom Cruise and a few amazing sequences can't carry the failure of the rest
","I'm a huge Tom Cruise fan, and I really wanted to like this film, but just couldn't.The romance was unbelievable, the plot poor, and the villain mis-cast. The dialog ranged from weak to cringe-inducing. During every action shot, a cheesy, hackneyed version of the main musical theme was played. Most of the fights were stylized and played in slow motion to the point of ridiculousness. One classic gadget was hideously overused. But my biggest gripe is that this is nothing like a Mission:Impossible movie. Gone is the stylish, slick, and very smart tone. Gone is our quick-on-his-feet hero with a magnetic smile. No more bluffs or playing sleight of hand with a 6 million dollar disc. Whoever John Woo thought his character is, he certainly isn't Ethan Hunt. And this movie sure isn't Mission:Impossible.Even if you can forgive the rape of Ethan and the franchise and hold this up to your average action flick, it still underwhelms.I don't blame the actors for this....they did what they could under terrible direction and with a terrible screenplay, Ving Rhames and Anthony Hopkins especially. And Tom always devotes himself to the film, managing here to be the only positive thing in the whole ordeal.Please forget this ever existed...go on to M:I:III and Ghost Protocol.",4,0,1,21 September 2012
Taken," More darkly thrilling than actually fun to watch
","Liam Neeson stars (and kicks butt, even at his age) in this dark, gritty thriller with a troubled tone.Brian Mills has worked for the government in the role of 'preventer': it was his job to prevent 'bad things' (we are left to assume assassinations, terrorism, etc) from happening. He is retired, and trying to build back a relationship with his 17-year-old daughter Kim, when she is Taken. But Brian has never lost his edge. Driven by love, protectiveness, and anger, he sets out to find her...and to destroy the men who took her.I really liked Taken, but the wanton, cold-blooded killings made me suck in my breath every time. Our hero is strong, angry and determined, but he is no saint, and he isn't bound by any sort of code. He kills, tortures, and even shoots an innocent person to gain leverage. For me, this is the only drawback.That being said, Taken was thrilling, exciting, and edge-of-your-seat. 8 out of 10. Enjoy!",8,0,1,10 October 2012
Mission: Impossible," This one will never go out of style
","You could look long and hard, and never find a film more fun to watch than Mission:Impossible. It's classy, stylish, and heart-pounding.First, let me address the frequent complaints about an overly complex plot. This is not true: there are a few lines you shouldn't miss, but pay attention as you watch and you will be fine (i.e., don't wander off to get popcorn).Ethan Hunt is an American agent who has been framed and falsely accused of treason and the murder of his team. He strikes out to clear his name with a group of similarly disavowed agents. Together they must prove that Ethan was set up, and prevent a dangerous weapons dealer from accessing a list that would betray the identities of every American deep cover agent alive.The story is well constructed, without the typical action movie plot holes. The film is well balanced between action and dialog. But the best part of M:I is Ethan Hunt, whom Tom Cruise not only portrays, but lives and defines. A rare action hero with a brain, Ethan is quick, fit, savvy with both a computer and a gun. Driven and determined, he thinks quick on his feet and doesn't look back. But the most rare (and valuable) trait he possesses is his powerful magnetism and charisma: he makes you like him, and instead of coming across as arrogant, his confidence and assurance draw you to him.I almost never give a film a 10/10 rating, but Mission:Impossible is one of those rare films that gets every detail right. There's nothing to dislike, and everything to enjoy...highly recommended!",10,2,3,16 September 2012
The Dark Knight Rises," Dark Knight Rises: Good, but not as good as I had hoped
","After The Dark Knight, my expectations for The Dark Knight Rises were very high. Though I didn't think it COULD be better, I hoped TDKR would be as good as its predecessor.Clocking in at nearly three hours, TDKR never dragged. The visuals were amazing, and it was nothing short of epic. But even so, after TDK, I was slightly disappointed.The acting was phenomenal. Christian Bale, stellar throughout the entire trilogy, reaches new heights while portraying a broken, reclusive Bruce Wayne. Gary Oldman, Morgan Freeman, and Michael Caine excel in their familiar roles, but the new additions are the ones who really shine. Marion Cotillard portrays Miranda Tate, a beautiful socialite who has not yet given up on Bruce. Anne Hathaway (who I admit I doubted) is the perfect Catwoman: full of witty one-liners and ingenious plans, lethal fighting skills, and a snarky but understated costume.But my favorite is Joseph Gordon-Levitt as young rookie cop John Blake. A strong new presence in Gotham's police force, Blake is idealistic, honorable, and brave. He still believes in Batman, but believes he has to do his part too, focusing on his police work with a lovable, honest intensity. The story starts with a reclusive, moody Bruce Wayne hiding in his mansion, refusing to see anyone. Many people have tried to bring him out of his shell, but it isn't until a mysterious thief enters his room, steals a valuable necklace and obtains his fingerprints for purposes unknown, that he emerges to face the world again. And when he does, he realizes that he has been hiding for far too long. Evil has risen. Chaos reigns in Gotham and their hero is missing. While a broken, desperate Bruce languishes in prison trying futilely to escape, Blake, Gordon, and a few others fight the mobs of angry criminals that Bane has unleashed to prey on the system that put them in prison. All bridges in and out of Gotham are destroyed. Streets are turned into a violent no-mans-land. And meanwhile an unstable atomic bomb is armed and ready to explode if Bane so chooses.When the climactic battle arrives, Batman, Bane, Catwoman, Gordon, Miranda Tate, John Blake, all of Gotham City's freed criminals, the entire Gotham City Police Departmen, a flying Batmobile, and an armored truck, all tangle in the streets while the seconds tick by towards the bomb blast that will destroy both sides.So, after watching TDKR, I was blown away by the special effects, extremely impressed by the acting, and very pleased with the new characters. Is it good movie, great, even? Yes. Is it the best of 2012? I'm willing to bet it will be. Does it live up to my extremely high expectations? No. Not quite.",8,1,3,22 July 2012
Speed," Stellar performances carry this classic action flick
","Nearly two decades after its release, Speed still stands out as a classic action movie. It's pure fun and excitement, through and through. The minor plot holes are easily forgiven and forgotten among the fascinating premise, frantic pace, and superb acting.Keanu Reeves' character is the brave, fiercely dedicated, instantly lovable, and absolutely adorable (if reckless to a fault) LAPD officer Jack Traven. Keanu does a great job, portraying all the intensity of a hot shot who works hard, loves to win, hates to lose, and refuses to let innocents die.Keanu is joined by Jeff Daniels, Sandra Bullock and Dennis Hopper, all of whom are admirable in their roles of mentor/best friend, innocent caught up in the action, and crazy (but not stupid) terrorist with an affinity for huge explosions.The plot: After LAPD officer Jack Traven foils a terrorist attempt to hold hostages for ransom in an elevator, the terrorist forms a personal grudge against Jack...and sets up an impossible scenario, knowing Jack will try to save the day, but planning that he will fail and die along with the rest of the hostages. A bomb is rigged under a city passenger bus...once the bus reaches 50mph the bomb is armed. If it drops below 50, the bomb detonates. And time is running out.",8,1,2,7 September 2012
Valkyrie," A powerful historical thriller
","Tom Cruise leads Valkyrie's strong cast as Claus von Stauffenberg, a German Colonol who saw his beloved country crushed as Hitler, obsessed with conquest, expended it in every way possible. Concluding that he could no longer serve both his country and the Fuhrer, Stauffenberg took on a central role in a plot to assassinate Hitler.I find it sad that reviewers who are clearly just criticizing Tom Cruise, and do not sound like they have even seen this movie, are giving it such poor ratings. Cruise's dedication to this film is tangible, and the results are admirable: not his usual flashy characters, but a serious, strongly motivated man in an impossible situation.And as for the movie itself, Valkyrie is based on true events. It started out a little slow, but picked up before long. It's a testament to everyone involved in the filmmaking process that Valkyrie manages to be suspenseful, even though we all know the basics of what will be happening, before we even see it.A dramatic and tragic, yet ultimately triumphant story, Valkyrie was so well-made and well-acted that I found myself shedding a tear at the end. 9 out of 10...highly recommended.",9,1,1,13 September 2012
