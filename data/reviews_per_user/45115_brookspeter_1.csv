Angels & Demons," More thrills than theology same plot different locale
",Its more of the same and I am bored with it. Hitchcock for 2009. An innocent by stander thrown in the middle of large scale political intrigue with the help of an unsuspecting and thoroughly supportive by stander. Yet this film is even more problematic in that so many of the nemesis' inherent contradictions defy what is plausible. Still its a spectacle and Howard cannot be criticized for his craftsmanship but at this point there is nothing new there. Its all formula.Which brings us to the question when does Howard get tired of seeing and making the same old film over and over again? When does he break the rules and defy his own convention? Will he ever present himself with challenges that will force him out of his comfort zone?,3,13,34,16 May 2009
