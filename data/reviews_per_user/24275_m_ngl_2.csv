Deja Vu," Unnecessarily convoluted
",This movie is great till you get to the part of the science fiction. It could have been a fantastic thriller.,5,0,0,12 July 2019
Avengers: Endgame," Just decent enough
","Infinity War is just too big of a movie to overcome & Endgame suffers from trying to do it. The pacing was bad. Some characters are misrepresented & their arcs are ruined by doing so. Somehow this movie can't handle the amount of characters in it, but it's predecessor do it really great. Disappointing.",7,6,14,25 April 2019
