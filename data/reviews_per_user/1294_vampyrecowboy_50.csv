"Run, Fat Boy, Run"," I watched 6 movies today
","I watched 6 movies today and this was the best of them.This has a plot, it has a beginning and an end. It starts and it ends with something solid.It has good writing, the right pace, the right amount of humor, the right amount of swearing, the right amount of action and good structure all around.It's a basic plot and one that is defined very easy.It's not overly confusing and is believable.The hero isn't the strongest, best looking, richest person and that's what makes it so cool.He's not even the winner.But that's what makes him a winner.A good film, directed by a friend...who does a better job directing than he does acting.David Schwimmer should continue to focus on directing rather than in-front of the camera, because that is where his strength lies...and he does it really well.This is not among my favorite movies, but it's not forgettable.It's solid through and through and the entire cast did a good job.",8,0,1,22 February 2009
The Blair Witch Project," Pretty damn good.
","This movie is pretty damn good - because it is basic and with all the overblown Hollywood puke and pulp that is produced over the years, basic is a new fresh start and a good idea.I am surprised that there aren't more movies like this - especially since the camcorder is such an available tool- except that I don't have one.I am also surprised that the 3 leads haven't had more success. With such a big film behind them - the highest grossing in North American sales from the smallest budget, these 3 leads should have offers tripping over them.I liked the movie and I look forward to those who can captivate us with brilliance on a small budget.",8,0,1,13 December 2009
Scarface," While I liked it...
","I also had some issues against it.Seeing this last night on the movie channel, and of course owning it, and also owning the script, I think it is a good film.It could have been better as well..After Tony and Manny quit their dish-washing jobs and after being in the US for a few weeks, they don't seem to be hard up for cash - even before taking on their new found careers as drug dealers.When they snort coke...and lots of it, they don't seem to get high...or if they are, they don't seem to change in any respect.Now if I were to stick my face in a bag of coke and inhale, my eyes would be red, my nose would be stuffed and my head would be focked...but that is not the case with any of the actors who partake in the fine recreational medication of coca.They just seem the same - and that does not fare to be realistic at all. They should have been wired, yappy, schizo, psycho and neurotic, but they weren't.Also - when Frank Lopez is about to be killed in his dealership, he crawls on his knees and begs to Tony, offering to pay him $10 000 000 not to be killed.That was just absurd...he whined like a baby...the guy was a high-roller and just caved in too fast...it didn't quite fit his character.With all the attention that Tony made in the bar and in the restaurant, nobody said anything...just not real.It was good, but as good as it was, it could have been better...However, it had some awesome lines - which will stand the test of time in cinematic history.I would have loved to see Tony Montana, after doing half a kilo of coke in one snort just sweating buckets, his eyes red and puffy, his lips ranting, his body shaking, his mind scattered and his character just ballistic and freaking...he did not...and that is where this film falls short.",7,1,2,24 September 2010
50 First Dates," If It Wasn't For Drew...
","If it wasn't for Drew, I would not have bothered to watch this.First of all, I think she is totally hot!!! That is definitely 1 thing going for her.The second is that she has an addictive charm about her.She can captivate a room with her smile and eyes...without having to say a word.The story was OK and the humor was good and most of the cast was also good, but the best written bits were with 10 second Tom...It's romantic comedy, so not overly deep with story - but there is one, yet it's undefined to it's true development.An easy way to pass time - but it's an Adam Sandler movie and like most; is just overdone with too much of him in it trying to be cool or outshine his real star.An over-player at all times, Adam Sandler doesn't know when to stop and start...he burns his presence out within the first minute.Ahhh Drew...where are you? Such a gorgeous woman!",7,0,0,11 August 2009
Catch Me If You Can," I stopped this movie 4 times...I barely ever stop a movie
","I saw this movie...it wasn't bad...it wasn't good...it just was....I stopped this movie 4 time when I played it...I barely ever do more than once.It had no tension...it wasn't a tight script...it just played along...just enough to keep it from being a 2 hour snoozefest.Performances were flat...not enough action...not enough mystery...not enough drama, not enough romance, not enough suspense....not enough of anything to make it worthwhile.Another rewrite on the script or in direction and editing and packaging and maybe this would be something worth playing all the way through.I'm glad I had a pause button for this...Supporting roles by minor players were better than the leads by far.",Null,0,1,8 February 2003
Resident Evil: Afterlife," Thew series that never wants to end
","OK...The story that starts and never wants to end.As much as I like the series...it's the same story - over and over..Zombies - zombies and more zombies.How much of a plot can be done with zombies? Really? Whether it's this movie or the others before this or any other zombie movie...they are basically all the same after 20 minutes in.The only reason I like this series is because of Milla...and maybe that's the only reason it keeps being made......but really....there is no real diversion from this story at all to any great extent and maybe there should be sometime.This is eye candy and mindless entertainment...with little focus on entertainment, but plenty on effects.Seriously. I lived in Toronto for 20 years or so and if I can't recognize a single building or location, then there is far too much green screen and CGI.When there is too many effects, little story and no logic, why make another one?Even if you change the lead cast...the story is still the same...as long as you have zombies and people that don't die...you can only go so far.This story won't end...",7,2,6,28 September 2010
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," Awesome costumes and makeup
","The costumes, makeup, set design and music were absolutely fantastic.There were so many good elements to this movie that made it good, however it was the script that seemed to suck.The story get so muddled in itself that it goes everywhere and goes nowhere. While the actors in all roles, small and big did a great job, it's the undauntedly overdone, unneeded and over executed action scenes and fight scenes that make this a very dreadful and tedious movie.This script goes all over the place with no real point - aside of continuing to a 3rd movie - which it will also go all over the place.Far too much action for something that could have been done much simpler.It's just overkill for the sake of pushing out a big money project.It had so much potential and lost it by trying to be something that wasn't.It wasn't entertaining after all the arguing, constant fighting and endless confusion.Some movies suffer from having not enough money or story to fill it. This movie suffered from having too much.However, the costumes and makeup and set design were just fantastic and there was some nifty camera work as well...too bad that a stupid script had to F it up.",5,1,2,1 October 2010
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," Another great role for Depp.
","I wasn't overly impressed with the movie itself.  The characters were interesting, the story a bit confusing, but I love everybit that Johnny Depp plays.Like in previous comments about where Johnny Depp is in films, he is one of the most talented performers I have seen on film. Aside from being good looking (yes I am a guy and yes, I do think he is good looking), he is also a fantastic performer; one who brings real character to his performance and characters.He is always somebody who attracts attention and doesn't need to carry a big gun and blow s**t up to do it.Every role he portrays is delivered with gusto and humor, even if the scene is morbid...figure that out.When Hollywood is looking for action hereos, they just have to look to Depp. (not the highest paying actor in film, but far far better than Jim Carrey)I look forward to more films with Johny Depp in them and woould like to see something that he can direct/write or create.I have never had the luxury to work with him, but hopefully someday I will.By chance, if you do get to read this Johnny, there are several fantastic screenplays that require your presence and you can reach me to find out more about them.",Null,0,0,21 November 2003
Balls of Fury," It's fun to pass the time with.
","A cool cast...Deidrich Bader was possibly the best character in the story...because he has such a unique role.James Hong was good to not have been typecast as the Chinese mafia head.The script was OK...not the best comedy...but for a PING PONG comedy..it got by...in fact I have never seen a comedy about ping pong before, so I guess it was actually pretty good.I mean how intense of a story can be made about ping pong? Right...so to have an action/comedy/romance script with pingpong as he driving force has to be really creative.Yesterday I watched a 'classic' - Butch Cassidy and The Sundance Kid...that was supposed to be a comedy...I didn't enjoy that Oscar award wining movie.I enjoyed this...and it will not win an award...but who needs an award really? Awards don't mean zhit in reality.This was OK...and I'm glad I saw it.",7,2,2,21 December 2008
X-Men Origins: Wolverine," I was really looking forward to this
","I was really looking forward to this and then when I got to see this, I was let down again.There are so many pieces missing that must have ended up in editing and the trash which could have made this a very much more interesting story.But the movie - as in all Hollywood type action movies had to go and overdo it again by making all the action so far fetched and uninteresting that they killed the story.Once again people, special effects don't make a story...a story does...get it? What's the story here? Good guy enforcer type breaks off with his enforcer buddies when they cross a line (apparently a man who spends a century and a half as a soldier can still be sensitive enough to feel bad about civilian casualties...) Buddies threaten to get him, he goes into hiding in the middle of nowhere with some super-hot girl.Buddies track him down, super-hot girl gets killed.Good guy goes on a rampage.Steven Segal made this same movie like 4 times back in the 80's, 90's.The only distinction is the lame plot twist at the end. What a waste of a good character and a good franchise.",Null,0,2,3 February 2011
How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days," FLUFFY >>>FLUFFY>>> OH SO FLUFFY How to plageurize a script and do small rewrites in 10 days.
","COPY - PASTE(yes this review will have spelling errors...but if you can deal with this film, and many others like it...you can deal with the spelling errors.)It works well. Do that to an entire screenplay and claim it as yours. Wow...what a cool concept. I think I'll try that with CASABLANCA.Yeah, you've read the reviews. It's like many others ...blah...blah...blah...It's very easy to predict and I didn't find either of them too convincing as their character's jobs are in jeopardy.Why was Ben always so desperate to watch the New York Nicks game instead of trying to please the woman that he was set out to WIN the heart of?Why was Andie not cruel enough after day 3? Her character was too lame and easy going.I was hoping that she would tear him to shreds and really try to humiliate him to all extremes.I was hoping that he would drool over her at every expense and be so sappy that it's uncontainably sick.That would have been sooo cool to see. This was just FLUFF.Why did Andie get to wear a 50 000 piece of jewellery just for walking into a business dinner?With all the *MILLIONS OF DOLLARS* of Diamonds around? Why was there not ANY security or armed guards?Why couldn't their breakup have been more violent and he tries to keep it.I just didn't believe that either of them needed their jobs and that they had so much time on their hands.New York is a hectic city, but it seemed SO slow paced here and easy going.If that's the best either of them could do and the hardest confrontations they will face, then their life is as easy as eating melting chocolate. It's not hugely terrible, but still easy to appreciate.Too sappy and too routine. Not a total waste of money or time, but if you've seen Pretty Woman, Never Been Kissed, Maid In Manhattan, 2 Weeks Notice or You've Got Mail and a slew of other 'romance comedies' (which are rehashed edited and edited scripts from a 'romance comedy script generator' screenplay program, then you've already seen this film.Just for future reference...make the breakups so tear-jerking that the viewer wants to commit suicide...then you know it's a real breakup.If I want flat cotton candy, I would go to the carnival and buy some and wait till it began to melt, not rent or buy a video.Why do broken hearted 'new lovers' always have to go out of town on a new job and how do they get the job so fast?Why must broken hearted lovers always go to the train station, airport, bus terminal or docks to catch a vessel to take them away after a breakup? Why can't they just whip the TV at the wall in anger? What about their rent and all the furnishings and their clothes?Why not have the newly separated run into the street and scream in anger and hostility and just be real? Introverted or extroverted. Maybe actually be careless and a slob or just outright lazy and depressed?Why can't the chick be a total whore at this point? To be hellbent on her ex after they breakup is natural...except in Hollywood or New York where we all must hop on a plane/ship/bus/ and get the hell out of town with only a small suitcase.Why do 'new found lovers' always have an endless indisposable income and why are their apartments so clean? If they led such an active life as we always see them do? Why is the apartment always tidy, the dishes washed, the bathroom clean? Do they have more hours in the day than we do? The lucky bastards!Why do supporting characters never really give ANY support aside from just trying to offer miniscule flat dialogue for brief moments of screentime.Ah...all the little things that a REAL screenwriter thinks of.",Null,0,1,16 May 2004
Hot Fuzz," Everything wrong with movies in one big mess
","Want an action movie...here it is...packed with a plot less story.Even though I am a British Citizen, this does not mean that I have to like horrible pointless British Comedy.I can't really explain where this went wrong - just that it did.Too much action, too much stupidity 1/2 way into a movie which had almost nothing going for it...I don't know what the writer was thinking, but it ended up being a horrible mess instead of a comedy, it became a failure.Boring characters lead into awful characters.It's something that you need an acquired taste for and I don't have it...If you like a script that goes everywhere - this is for you.Enjoy.",3,2,9,23 February 2009
L.A. Confidential," This has the best fight scene I have ever seen.
","I loved this movie not for the story, because I didn't see it from the beginning.This film had the best or second best fight scene I have ever seen. The other fight scene I love is the final scene in The Long Kiss Goodnight.Finally somebody who knows how to film a good fight scene. The office fight was just awesome. The BEST or SECOND ever filmed.Even Jackie Chan's fights don't come this good. He is good...very good, but not this good. This has INTENSITY, aside from just ass kicking.Loved the lighting and the costume / set designer. Wicked.Now I know how to write a good fight scene. I never saw a fight scene this cool. Truely.Good lighting, good framing, good color, but a FLIPPEN AWESOME FIGHT SCENE. Very in-depth and charged.KUDOS the the director, stunt performers and writer!",Null,0,1,14 March 2003
The Prestige," A cool movie
","A cool movie that has a really good ending.Directed by the same director as The Dark Knight, I enjoyed this much better.The cast was great and the costumes were really done well.For a movie all about English people, most of it was filmed in L.A., in a warehouse or on a stage - which looks really cool.The set design is what impressed me the most. The entire film had to be done in late 1800 time period and looked like the real deal.It shows a few magic trick secrets that are nice to know.The entire film was just great from start to finish.",9,0,1,23 February 2009
Cloverfield," Irritatiing to the extreme
","20 minutes into the movie - we get something happening, until then it's just shitty camera work, uninteresting plot buildup, no character development - not even bad character development.Really...who has a party that big for somebody who is going away? How many pretty people were there? 200 for a going away party? Yeah...right...and they all were young, pretty people.No scars, no zits, not even bad teeth.Shitty movie...The monster had more personality.The movie insults anybody who lived through the 911 attacks on New York city.It's just bad judgment to use NYC for this movie...Chicago would have been better.The camera work is just horrible and the dialogue is sooooo bad. Just hundreds of people screaming into a camera.Not a good movie...go watch Sesame Street if you want to see monsters in downtown New York City.30 minutes into the movie and I'm still not interested.I hope there's no sequel to this piece of crap. It doesn't deserve one.I've watched 10 movies in the last two days and this had to be the worst.I look forward to bad television commercials or to getting my haircut.It's just pretty damn boring and irritating.30 minutes into it, I turned off the movie and didn't feel bad about doing so.",1,1,4,26 December 2008
Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid," Lifeless and soulless
","I waited so long to see this...why? I don't know.I was expecting lots of laughs, some good old fashioned gun fights in saloons, real western stuff.However what I got a a boring, lame-ass, put me to sleep movie, nothing really worth viewing or waiting to view.Aside of some decent camera shots and settings, and the nice stunt work from jumping off a cliff into some rapids...the rest is just a waste.What I don't understand is...these 2 guys robs banks and trains and payroll...they have a ton of cash to spend, but they decide to flee the country with all their wealth and do nothing with it.They eat lavish and wear very nice attire and can live very well of with what they have in finance, but they don't.What kind of stupidity is that? Say that you've robbed a whack of banks...gathered up around $500 000 in todays currency and fled the country to another country where your money will make you uber wealthy...Why even bother to continue to rob and steal? Buy a house, live by the beach, go fishing...whatever...They had the money to go on a train and on a ship across the ocean and to start all over, fresh...but they totally wasted this opportunity.And back then, it was much easier in terms of getting away with crime So the overall story sucked.Even written in the late 60's, this made for a a really boring movie.After viewing Bonnie & Clyde and Butch Cassidy and the Sudance Kid within 2 weeks of each other, I realize that back in the late 60's...making quality films was close to non-existent.All one has to do is have some lame action for about 2 hours and the characters have to travel across the country - as in soooooo many movies that were made in the 60's and 70's.Assuming that these were really great scripts - which they are not, I would have hated to read the one which the studios passed on.I guess if somebody was able to type 130 pages or so script on a type writer without too many errors, then it would be made into a screenplay.I have seen too many movies where the stories were just time wasters - and they were made in the 60's.Aside from some Clint Eastwood flicks, the rest are just super boring.No real western that emerged from the 60's or 70's had any real plot.Catherine Ross's character was a waste - as were most of the actors in this title.Am I impressed? No.Is it Oscar material? No.Is it to stand the test of time? No Is it a remedy for putting somebody to sleep fast after a long day of work or insomnia? YES! For a movie that I always wanted to see...this sucked.Another Hollywood let down.I am slowly realizing that I don't care to see cinema from generations PRE 1980.If this is quality story telling, then I would rather look at porn...it has as much depth, but is more visually stimulating.",2,15,38,20 December 2008

No...I'm wrong...there is no script.This is just a bunch of people randomly making lines up as a shaky camera operator jogs around and films it and then somebody smashes it all together.Does it mean anything?Yes...it means it's pretty damn awful.

Horrible Bosses," Horrible bosses - horrible movie
","I've met horrible bosses.My business partner was an absolutely horrible boss which I hope I never work with again.The bosses in this movie were just bad...not horrible.The movie was worse than the bosses ever were.I was anxious to see this and actually made time for this - only to be letdown.Kevin Spacey did a much better job in Swimming With Sharks and somehow seems greatly wasted in this film.Jason Bateman lacks pizazz. He lacks spark, not that he is a bad actor, but he's not a lead. He's far from a lead. His presence lacks in every film he's in.The movie is slow, sloppy and boring and overall bad. It's pieced together just to put something on screen - because the bosses (though not the best) were just bad, not horrible.There could have been so much more done to improve this script and make this movie much more funnier, but was sadly missed.",Null,1,3,8 October 2011
Shutter Island," Better than Inception
","Seeing both Inception and Shutter Island on the same week, I found that Shutter Island - even though done with a far smaller budget than Inception was by far a much better movie.It's a mind trip and plays out pretty good.Everything was pieced nicely together and the setting in the 1960's or so made this movie all the better.Had it been set in present day, things just wouldn't seem to fit right.Good casting and performances from all actors - well known and lesser known.Not too shabby at all.If you're deciding upon Inception or Shutter Island, this may be a far better movie and much more enjoyable.",8,0,1,11 January 2011
Bridget Jones's Diary," Boorish
","It's a boorish movie with sticky British boorish people.Uppercrust party people who like to mingle and discuss boorish topics.An aging boorish actress who looks like she's drunk all the time meets 2 boorish men who discus boorish topics and try to impress this boorish woman.Trying to be humorous and passing the hour and a half mark, but still being boorish...this is not half as good as the second movie - which also is boorish, but not nearly as much.What I can't believe by any standard is that the VP of a publishing company would by any means hook up with a boorish, overweight, love sick secretary who needs so desperately.",4,4,7,24 February 2009
The Italian Job," They are greedy pricks.
","While the car chase and boat chase was interesting, it doesn't keep the story tight.Now I'm all for action, and car chases too...but in order to justify their anger, they put thousands of lives at risk just to get even.In order for this team to complete their goal, they had to cause major destruction and heartache to thousands of people that have no involvement into their personal lives.Do the other folks who are hindered in traffic due to car accidents and traffic pileups and road constrictions share any of the gold? NO! Do the people injured in the vehicle accidents have to deal with problems resulting from the accident? YES! Now people's lives are thrown of course, their insurance rates go up. Their personal problems are increased and they just wanted to carry on with their simple lives that had nothing to do with anybody else's gold or murder.Do people going late to work have to deal with problems due to being held up in the subway or traffic? Yes, they do...but how are they to know why all this trouble for them came about? They don't...but it affects many many people who should not be affected due to greed...and that is what is was all about.If the team wanted to get even with this guy...there are thousands of ways to do so without disrupting the entire traffic flow and emergency system of the city.They were selfish and greedy and stupid...all while trying to look cool.So with Charlize at the wheel and some few chases which were pretty awesome...the rest of the story is pathetic.The moral? It's OK to screw somebody over as long as you disrupt everybody else's life in order to get what you want.This story got lost after 25 minutes and somehow the writer thought that to make it interesting, he had to cause major havoc and destruction.You'll make your own judgment...My votes are for Charlize and the cars...the plot is thin...Now there is to be a second film made...why? They got away with 27 million dollars. Is that not good enough? Whya re they so greedy? I found this repulsive overdone Hollywood mentality garbage with pretty scenery blended in to make it easy to swallow.",7,0,1,11 January 2006
She's the Man," Pretty insulting
","It's lame. It's really insulting to women and men.The principal's casting was very bad - and really, what point did he have in the film? None.Amanda Bynes a a guy? Are you kidding? Out of all the actresses across the globe who can actually look like a guy, SHE got the part? NOOOOO. It's not right.Horrible dialog and really bad script.She was supposed to look like her brother? He is a geek, but he doesn't have a young girl's chin or lips or hips or eyes or nose.She doesn't make the cut a s a girl switching places.Her character was so badly created, it was insulting.The tampon in the nose....truly awful...not funny, it has no place there. This is supposed to be kid friendly, not low grade porn.She's the Man is a low grade copy of many other films where the girl has to stand up for their gender, but this one fails miserably.I don't know where to begin with the bad comments.For a film marketed with this kind of budget and distribution, it was a poor quality story at best.",4,1,3,21 October 2006
Bad Teacher," It's a miss
","What could have been and should have been is a miss.There was potential to be absolutely great, but then it just died and went towards the way of being boring and mundane.Plenty of opportunity to make this movie absolutely hilarious - far more than it was, but somehow, someone had to sneak in a poorly developed lesson about morals and ethics - which never did hit the mark, instead of turning this into a total riot filled with dark humour.This could have been great - like the movie 'Very Bad Things' - which featured Cameron Diaz as well, but ends up being a poorly underdeveloped picture that leaves you wanting more.",Null,1,4,8 October 2011
Aliens," Far better than Independence Day
","I watched Aliens for the first time yesterday...and I have not watched any other of the series.However I have also watched Independence Day on the same day...and all I can say is that Aliens is by far a much better movie in all aspects.Both are space movies and both have to go into your beyond belief stage of realism, but this move blows ID4 away by leaps and bounds.This movie was made on a far smaller budget and gets far better results.I am waiting to see the next Alien movie in the series and even though I owned them all, I never saw them.They seem pretty interesting now.",8,0,1,29 June 2009
No Strings Attached," Boring and stupid and rude

Independence Day," Years later and it's still a retarded piece of crap
","Made in 1996, this was an insult to my intelligence. Even as a young adult, I found this to bee too stupid to be entertaining.Of course, I don't live in Hollywood - wait, I did then...for a few months.However, this movie is so full of American propaganda that it hurt my head to watch it.From beginning to end and everywhere in between, this movie was just a nasty mess.Apart from all the flaws that you read on every other post, this made the USA look so bad in the eyes of other nations that instead of promoting the country to something of a hero, it made the US look like a total mess of self serving, egoistic, glory hungry retards.Why had the President and the US Armed Forces not try to contact any other nation's leaders in trying to overcome the aliens? Because the US leaders, politicians and gatekeepers want to prove to the world that they have the answer and solution to even the most insane and unforeseen problem attacking the world.There have been lots of horrible movies, but this one is definitely in the top 20.I knew the US would save the world and I hated the movie for it. I was really hoping that the aliens would blast the zhit out of the USA, so that the rest of the world could possibly try to negotiate some sort of truce with the aliens.As you can see, Germany or England, Russia or Australia did not attack. And the aliens didn't even think of hovering over Canada - even though it's right close to the USA! What happened there?By this film, they stood idly by, watching everything fall to the floor in flames and it was only the US that was able to do anything.What a load of s__t! Too retarded for somebody who doesn't fall for American machismo...too much Hollywood for Hollywood.What happened to Hollywood? Can't they find any more Bruce Willis clones to make action movies anymore? They have to try to result to DRAMATIC action with a huge cast of characters who in their own right should not be paid 1/10th of the wage they earn.I'm certain that had Brad Pitt been a star that year, his ugly mug would have been in there somewhere - as well as his bitch of a wife.",1,19,36,29 June 2009
Dog Day Afternoon," Go to sleep instead.
","Wow, a bank robbing movie with little interest.What do you think will happen? Not much. It's a lame film with little development and no funny or catchy lines.No real action and it just drags.If this is quality film making in the 1970's - then they had some pretty low standards around that time.The robbery and everything that happened in the bank and around the bank was a total letdown.So boring...why did I bother to waste my time watching it?

Clint's pushing close to 100 or so....While he was great as a cowboy and as a overdone cop and in other roles, he sucks in this one.As a performer I think he is just awesome...but this movie stinks.I was really looking forward to this for some reason - but when I got to the end, I was disappointed again by Hollywood.Though it's not a blockbuster, action or drama - it also doesn't have the strength to be really compelling either.Story kind of sucks and well...really what does the Torino have to do with it at all? So misleading and dreary - hopefully the old folk will like it after watching Matlock and Murder She Wrote.I'm really looking forward to a Golden Girls action move...maybe Clint could do one in the near future.",3,7,15,7 February 2009
K-19: The Widowmaker," Gentlemen, lets speak Russian with an English accent, yes?
","Ah - gentlemen, you are all gathered here to read the documents of the K-19 Widowmaker.It is a Russian submarine, trapped with nuclear missiles...odd as I am Russian with an Englsih accent, do I say MISSISLES? Here we go...let us get a boring lead actor with another boring lead actor, put it in a boring script and submerge it in a boring setting.Add some boring tension and some boring character structure as well as the routine boring army and militant dialogue which most of the human world does not understand and we will have a heavily produced boring movie over blown with boring Hollywood hype.We will get a boring Hollywood actor who hasn't been in a good role since Witness or Star Wars and assure that his name gets first credit and that we soak you for more money as you rent this movie.Yeah - it's another outdone Hollywood mess with Harrison Ford at the helm again...and this time he's practising his Russian accent...unfortunately, there are not enough actors who can full the job to portray a real Russian.Wow - what has Hollywood lowered itself to? A Scotsman and an American with strong English accents trying really hard and failing to be Russian Comrades all the while real actors who have mastered the art of accents or even imagine this.....real Russian/Ukranian actors getting the role.A failure from open to close of credits...headlined by Harrison Ford and Liam Neeson.",1,3,8,21 August 2009
The Twilight Saga: New Moon," I'm not the only one thinking that this was
","retarded...I have the DVD sitting on the table near my computer where I was eagerly awaiting seeing a twilight movie...and after 3 years, I finally did.Even though I passed by the set countless number of times and I did not walk onto it, I finally came about and even though living in the same town and knowing people who worked on the set, I gave in and got a Twilight movie.Disappointment ensued.Aside of flat characters and even flatter performances from any leads or even supporting cast, the movie was almost entire shot on green screen - which makes for poor story exploration.The story dragged and was boring...the actors lacked any real interest.Now, if I was a 13 year old girl...swayed by mass marketing and publicity and Entertainment Tonight pushing Robert Pattinson's face across the screen, I might think different - but I'm not......so for sex appeal on any of the leads...they have none...least of all Robert.They just drag any character they have to as long as they can before they wear it out.They don't have any zest or charisma or special draw that pulls us in.I can't imagine sitting through 3 of these movies - because it's overblown Hollywood hype with marketing and publicity tried to make a story where there was none.Without all the aforementioned hype, this movie would have been passed upon by the majority of the public and only been watched by the 'serious' vampire buffs.That aside...this movie sucks...pun intended.There are far better vampire movies...this is not in the mix.This just bites...once again...pun intended.",3,8,11,24 September 2010
Shrek 2," Love the Cat
","Puss in Boots was the best character in there.Developed really good with character and even duologue.While I enjoyed all of the Shrek films, Puss in Boots has enough merit to stand on his own in his own film.I like the little inside jokes about Hollywood and the 'knights' takes on 'cops'.Graphics are pretty awesome, story is nicely crafted and while there are people who don't get this...that's OK...they are the kind of people who enjoy stuff blowing up for no reason - and there are plenty of movies made for them.This movie and the other Shrek movies are great.Hilarious, nicely paced with a good story and the proper humor for today.Voice casting was great - especially Antonio Banderas...I never thought that I would like a Shrek movie, then one day I just happened to be in a room where one was playing (Shrek 3) and after that I watched the entire show.I enjoyed it so much that I wanted to see the first 2.Really cool in so many ways.I don't really think that the story was made for kids as much as it was made for teens or even adults under 35.The way it's written with the little inside jokes into todays culture plays to more like a crowd of 15 - 35ish.Had this not been made in animation, the film probably would never had been made or even put past the first reader.I like it...and it entertained.It made me laugh...and there are so may comedies which don't.Once again - Antonio's voice casting was exceptional casting for the cat. Wow...who would have thought?",9,0,2,12 January 2009
Drag Me to Hell," Pretty Damn Good
","It's not often that I enjoy a horror movie...in fact it's been years.The Jason and Freddy movies just don't entertain me at all.This movie kicked ass.Along with some really cool special effects and a great sound track, there was also Alison Lohman whom I thin was cast excellent as well as the rest of the cast - even the little people who didn't get credit.It was scary and funny and exciting at the same time - which is a rarity - even with a little gore.Damn, I enjoyed this movie and I had to rate it pretty high.Somehow I can easily imagine a sequel with her back as a demon.Yeah...I liked this...and she looked pretty sweet in a tight t shirt in the pouring rain as well. I had to give the movie points for that.",9,1,4,2 June 2010
Pretty Woman," 15 years later and it still sucks.
","The first time I saw this was when I was with a date, and she thought it was an awesome movie. I didn't.The second time I saw this was last night on TV. It still sucks.As a love story this sucks. As having Julia portray a street hooker, this is repulsive. To me she was a librarian with a miniskirt and heels. She had no tough shell to her. She wasn't tortured, anguished, enraged, starving or anything else. Her 'HOOKER' character was so flawed, like comparing a cubic zircon to a diamond. The two simply don't fit, no matter what they look like.The ONLY cast I felt was worth watching was the 2 bitchy saleswomen, whom were excellently cast. They did such a fine job that I hated them for the few seconds that they were on screen. They had real definition, for the minor roles. OK, so the movie wasn't entirely trash...the two ignorant saleswomen saved the film.Aside from those two women sales people, the rest of the cast...including the big names was just crap. Either everybody was an ass-kisser or had absolutely no reason to fill any dialog in the movie aside from just complimenting Julia Roberts or kissing ass to Richard Gere.This was a movie about how when you walk around in high-heels and a tight skirt in Beverly Hills, people leer at you and guys who work in hotels gawk as if they just had a baseball bat struck to their face.While in reality, the women who are dressed to the nines in Beverly Hills are hookers and prostitutes to a higher degree, but since they aren't wearing the gaudy Madonna looking jewelry or the patent boots, they can look down on the others who do.The hotel cast was sickeningly sad to watch, and anybody who had any real character had less than a minute of screen time.This is an insult to romantic movies, comedies, dramas and even to prostitutes who face wealthy customers on a daily basis with hopes of having their lives work out perfect.The story is about Julia Roberts being PIMPED (yes PIMPED) by a multimillionaire in a business suit and limousine.She is still owned, still told how to act, how to move, what to wear, what to say, where to go and what to do. He is more controlling than a street pimp, but the folks at Disney/buena vista butter it up to make it easier to swallow.Had Richard Gere been a black man with a gold tooth and an AK-47 at his side instead of an attaché case, this movie would be about how a woman has to struggle to get away from the harshness of prostitution. Same story, different characters will make a very different outlook.Oh yeah, change the white man for a black man or Asian or Spanish, have the land business deal be changed to a deal of weapons or narcotics and the entire concept of romantic comedy is thrown away.As far as I'm concerned, Pretty Woman is still trash, dressed with ribbons and bows.I didn't like it 15 years ago, when I didn't understand it and was led by the Hollywood hype. I hate it now that i can see past the pretty decorations that is called 'love'.This movie is NOT a romantic comedy. It's a story on how to control a woman as long as you have the means and income to do so.This is an insult to strong women, weak women and women in general, as well as to my television screen.Do I hate it? Yes. Does it suck? Yes Would I recommend it to you? NO...well maybe if I really hated you.Will this review get posted? We'll see.Anywayz, that's all for now.",1,119,234,29 May 2005
The Descent," Not bad, but it seemed a little slow
","I saw this on the computer. On a small 17 inch screen, so I may have missed plenty.For some reason, I couldn't get the DVD to work and I put this in the computer. I imagine that seeing this on a larger screen would have made this much more interesting and having surround sound would have made all the difference, but on a small screen, it seemed lost and out of place.There are times when the story just drags and seems too slow for a horror movie and then there are times when it's too fast, but overall, it's not bad, but there could have been more tension and a better sound track.Seeing this with the second one to follow, and without interruptions would probably be much more entertaining.Not a bad movie, but still a little slow, and not truly scary.",7,0,3,10 February 2011
Mr. & Mrs. Smith," Overblown Hollywood
","So it had a big budget...big friggen deal.So it had name stars...big friggen deal.It was overblown and over-done far more extreme than it had to be.Yes, there were parts were were interesting...the electronic gear was pretty cool.The dining scene in the house was written well and played good.The stove which opened into a safe was interesting.Does this all compensate for another viewer let down? Does Vince Vaughn's character have to be so aggravating? Does Angelina's character have to be so perfect? Yes, I think she had the best dialog, and it clearly was constructed around her...but as beautiful as she is...and she is very....it still was overdone.I would have liked this much more if all the Hollywood explosion type effects and over done attitude was wiped out and it was cut down to a smaller scale.Maybe on the second one it will be....and you got to be close to certain, there will be a second one...in something like this, there always is.At least it kept people in the film industry employed.Do I recommend it to people? Just for those that are mindless drones...fueled by Hollywood Propaganda.",5,0,3,8 January 2006
War of the Worlds," Can you say ...stupid?
","STUUUUUPIDDDD STUUUUPIDDD Stupid.Stupid...see, it's that easy.Yes, a Hollywood letdown - done with truckloads of millions of dollars to offer you something so retarded at best, that it leaves you wondering at the end why it was ever made in the beginning.Don't look for a story line, don't look for anything of interest, because it just won't be there.Instead, look for stupidity and you will find it - from opening scene to very last scene.Enjoy it...yeah, right - whatever.Hahahahaha What a POS!I want my money back for the time I wasted - hoping that I would be entertained, but I got this from the library on DVD and I didn't have to pay for it; however I am still out of luck.I may not have spent money on this POS, but I still lost part of my life thinking that this had anything of validity to offer anybody on this planet.",1,2,4,29 January 2010
Hancock," It's a mess - just like Hollywood intends it to be
","Yeah, Hollywood makes another Superhero movie. This time it's Will Smith, playing in-front of a blue-screen and special effects.To think that he gets paid for crap like this is even more insulting.The story is slow and without the lead of Charlize - oh beautiful Charlize, this mess of a movie would flop.The story relies heavily on computer graphics. Now, what would happen if there were no computer graphics? He would not be a superhero.The days when Will Smith was a performer portraying real parts with real people is something to look back in wonder with.Hancock was a collective mess from the first 5 minutes and remained a collective mess to the very end.Poor Charlize has to deal with lame films without having the real potential script offered to her.Yes, sweetie - it's waiting here for you.",4,1,4,29 January 2010
Hitch," A half hour comedy turned into a full feature movie mess
","Congratulations - you've come upon another 'romantic comedy' movie.Well, here is my opinion and since my opinion counts - then take this advice, watch something better...and You've Got Mail is not any better either. This is a sad attempt at something funny - overloaded with so much rehashed writing from other people that it is sickening to watch and not leave your seat.Just a little wonder...why everybody in New York City always works in an office and has a social life and a clean apartment and always fresh dressed clothes and all the time in the world and never looks tired.In the world of Hollywood and New York - all businesspeople will always have the cleanest apartments in the city. They will have the newest clothes, the bed is always made, there is always a parking space available and everything is easily at hand whenever is needed.Ahhh to be young and pretty - working as an office clone and living in New York or L.A. - where the world works in mysterious ways...just for you.",3,1,2,13 December 2009
Inception," Not as good as I expected it to be after all the hype.
","This is just an average big budget Hollywood movie.Don't expect any complexity or depth from it, it is simple and quite shallow.Technically it's well done, the plot is OK, the actors are fine, the FX are good and hopefully you will have a good time watching the characters running and jumping around, ducking bullets and explosions and so on while a VERY SIMPLE AND QUITE SHALLOW psychological-scifi plot unfolds.But you won't get much else from it.I'm giving it a 7. So folks, don't believe the hype about this thing being a fascinating and revolutionary piece of art, because IT'S NOT. It's just another Hollywood commodity out to make big bucks. If you want some enlightening psychology read '?' and don't watch this, for ***ck's sake.There are some really cool effects to this film, but the story is so convoluted that it detracts away from the story.",7,5,8,5 January 2011
Iron Man," Yay for America
","Another movie to glamorize America.What would we do without America as the good guys? While it had decent effects and everything seemed kinda fun, it relied upon the overall effect of America the strong and good and saviour and that other nationalities are sub-par.The bad guys this time are in Afghanistan.Yeah America - hero's to the world...all hail government propaganda.I never read the Iron Man comics and most likely never will, so I can't compare the comics to this - but I know what feeding me lies about military and everything it stands for is.",3,7,14,8 February 2009
Live Free or Die Hard," I had to lower the star rating.
","OK, you read a lot of comments, some good, some bad.This is not a Die Hard movie, it's a movie about another character with the name John McLane.What I found really hard to believe...even beyond the airplane/truck or car/helicopter or suv/elevator shat thing was the fact that all these computer geeks knew exactly how to use each program the very second that they needed it.The computer freaks knew the passwords, knew how to get around, how to lock, unlock, reroute, block, delete whatever they needed without any thought to them.Another thing...if the bombs were already attached to the computers in the beginning of the movie to blow up on que, why weren't they set to blow up immediately...why did the computer users have to hit a certain key before hand? These bombs were mounted inside their dwellings, and were put there well ahead of time but are only set to explode upon a certain keystroke? What happens if that key never gets used? What happens if the hard drive or motherboard fries or the power gets turned off? McLane had no real fistfights, no real chase with the final bad guy, didn't have too much personal interaction.In the first few minutes while the buildings are being shot and torn apart and explode...nobody in the neighboring apartments calls the police or fire department? Nobody cares about the building they live in? Nobody hears a bomb blow up or rapid fire tear apart a hallway, door, wall or ceiling? The computer graphical interfaces for all the government computer systems just weren't convincing - the entire idea that everything is operated within 1 room just doesn't play right.Also John gets thrown about all over the place but doesn't limp, doesn't break a bone, doesn't sprain an ankle - gets a couple bruises, but nothing serious.This movie should have been renamed something else with a female lead - maybe Gina Gershon in a movie titled 'Adrenaline'.While it was entertaining and wasn't horrible in the fact that is was lame...it just didn't work as a Die Hard movie.But you'll find that out soon enough.Oh yeah, by the way...were do bad people and super villains get recruited? How do they get access to all the latest hardware, technology, weapons, transportation system and everything else...I mean...if they have all the money for that stuff...why do they need more? That already cost hundr4eds of millions of dollars alone...why make you lifelong ambition as a supervillian to get more money which you can't spend and risk your life to do so? For the bad guys to set this all up had to take millions upon millions of dollars and I assume that it also took years to plan the entire structure...so why risk blowing it all when you already have the millions upon millions of dollars to start up your nasty scheme? Makes no sense to me.I didn't pay to see this and I'm glad that I didn't.So much money spent on this in all areas of production and marketing and yet it still doesn't hit the mark.",3,4,7,25 December 2008
The Ringer," A great supporting cast
","While I liked the movie, I liked the story and the cast...it was the supporting cast that was better than the lead Johnny Knoxville.To me, his performance was weak, but maybe it was intended to be that way.It's got funny moments but as some people states that it insults the handicapped - no, it does not.This film honors not only the people in the special Olympics, but those that are with mental, physical or other types of handicaps and it doesn't show them as slow, stupid or unable to perform simple tasks or not cope in the real world.It's a good film, that only loses it's place in the last two minutes of the entire movie.This is far better than a Jim Carrey movie which insults handicapped people of all types.",8,1,1,23 February 2009
Easy A," Easy A get an Easy A
","Wow...first time I actually felt like I should pay for a movie in a long time.I love watching movies and I usually hate teen comedies...this was a very nice rare exception.Some of the stuff was over the top in terms of the parents, but not too much.Emma Stone who is not only super hot, but also super exciting on the screen really pulled off an exceptional performance with some well developed material.Of the two comedies I watched at the theatre that day, 'The Other Guys' and 'Easy A', this is by far one which I enjoyed on so many levels and was actually glad that the ticket was paid for, because the story was great and the humour was actually funny and meaningful.I had a great time when usually I regret sitting in a movie theatre with most of the stuff which has come out in the last few years.It's a nice refreshing change to see a well written story with a good cast.",9,0,1,20 September 2010
Pineapple Express," Bunch of garbage.
","Total trash...No matter how hard I tired to enjoy it, it just sucked.It's tragic really. A shitstorm mess from start to end.Nothing of value, not even a good soundtrack.It's a disgrace - even to pothead movies.Below low grade porn and not half as entertaining.Another Hollywood comedy with NO comedy whatsoever.Even if I was stoned, this would not be good by any measure.Wow, I've been watching so many horrible made movies from Hollywood lately...what is happening? Is this the best you can come up with?",1,12,26,29 January 2009
A Walk to Remember," This is a PHENOMINAL movie.
","I love watching movies. I love em, I love em alot.This is possibly THE BEST LOVE STORY I have EVER seen.As far as performances and storytelling, this was top notch for a low budget film without super well known stars.I have never heard of Mandy Moore before this film, and I didn't even see this film at the theatres. I came across it by chance.I was blown away. Very good writing, very good performances.The few routine elements that were easily foreseen were minor and blended well together in here. This is far from a standard teen love story.This is a story that should be a classic. I would place it in the same category as Casablanca...something very romantic and tear jerking at the same time...but for a newer generation.As far as pop-stars performing in films, when you add all the Britney Spears, Whitney Houston's, Madonna's, Mariah Carey's, Hilary Duff's and everybody else, Mandy Moore certainly supercedes them with her role this movie.This is the best teen movie I have ever seen and also one of the best I have come across in general. This topped Titanic for any romantic quality.The casting was fantastic and setting was also superb.This movie is certainly worth the price tag that it is billed and would recommend it for either a date movie or for just viewing on your own for any age group.As for Mandy Moore's musical career, I don't care for her work, but her performance here is of high calibur and believe that she should stick to film rather than trying to be the next Britney Spears.Infact Britney should be taking acting tips from Mandy Moore. This script had such depth that even I cried...and that NEVER happens.",Null,0,0,26 April 2004
True Romance," This screenplay cooks.
","This movie truely cooks.This is a perfectly scripted screenplay. From the casting, to the camera work and editing...YEAH!My old house was in the scene where Dennis Hopper and Christian Slater are talking at the train yard. It is the large white house that is overlooking the river.I don't only like it for that reason, but because it is justa cool flick...and I don't know why some people put this down...you folks want a really bad movie? Try...How High or Hell Raiser 3...yes, they really suck...Thsi movie however really cooks...I love it. 9 1/2 out of ten starry things.",Null,0,1,17 November 2002
The Runaways," As a fan of Joan Jett...
","Well, I finally watched this and it was OK...but once again, Hollywood has to take control and bastardize something that could have been better.Joan Jett is awesome as a singer...and she should have made sure that when Kristen sung her songs, she really belted them out.As the 2 girls who portrayed Joan and Cherie, they missed a lot.They didn't have the energy...Joan Jett really belts out and really gives a wild and raw performance - even 20 something years later.The story seemed to drag and there was not enough anger or anguish to make it really interesting...not entirely bad, it just didn't have the sparkle and raw energy that I was expecting.Dakota and Kirsten did a remarkable job on looking like them but failed on the singing and playing in my opinion - as I have all the music and think that they were one of the best female singers to ever come out...Shania Twain, Pat Benatar, Belinda Carlisle and Alannah Myles aside.They have such grit and sexual energy which didn't emit on screen and much of the story should have lasted longer.I felt shortchanged on a movie I was really looking forward to see.",6,0,4,24 September 2010
Back to the Future," Best Damn Film EVER Made
","I don't care what anybody says...I love this film.I have watched it more than 80 times, and I still love.From the story, to the setting, the music, the effects, the casting, the makeup, costumes, set design---everything.This is the BEST movie EVER made.I've seen a lot...I like a lot...but nothing tops this...not now, not then, not before this was released at theaters.The entire crew - cast, - extras and everybody involved should be rewarded very handsomely for this...and the following sequels.There may be some flaws in the story...but I love it.There has not been one time when this was on screen that I ever switched it to something else.Nothing else comes close. As far as I'm concerned...nothing ever will.I am so impressed with this movie that I don't even know how to end this comment aside of to state that if all films were made of this caliber, every movie would be a blockbuster.23 years later and this is till my favorite movie. It withstood the test of time, it never seems outdated...it is so cleverly structured and developed that if anything else ever comes this close to it, there might be some slim chance in hell that movies will be somewhat entertaining.Whenever the theme music comes on the speakers, I crank it up.Wow...what can I say that is negative about it? Only that I was not part of it...and yet, maybe that's a good thing.VERY IMPRESSED!!!!!!!!",10,4,5,27 December 2008
Law Abiding Citizen," Could have been a really great film
","What went wrong? It's hard to believe that the DA would halve made such an ridiculous deal in such a horrendous high profile crime. But OK maybe? Then they trot out the murderer who got the sweet deal in front of the press.(I think he'd go out the back door). Then the Jamie Fox character shakes his hand in front of the entire press corps only to have photographers capture and print the picture...wow, stupid or what? He would have been crucified for doing that by the media in any city. He wouldn't have his job a week later let alone ten years later. There's much more to say but this is just indicative of film making by committee.I bet the original script was great. This film is a mess. Too bad! Style before substance.The ending - the last 15 or 20 minutes or so was just horrible.It could have been really good, but it certainly wasn't biblical.",4,4,8,10 February 2011
