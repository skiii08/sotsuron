Hereditary," An Awful Ending to a Terrific Film
","'Hereditary' is truly one of a kind. It's a dramatic thriller that stands out for its intriguing plot, powerful performances and well-achieved cinematographic elements. However, that ending... OMG! What the hell were they thinking with that nonsense twist at the end?? It even made me laugh! It felt like 'Rosemary's Baby' was plagiarised for absolutely no reason. It's a shame considering how good most of the film is.'Hereditary' is extremely effective as a tension-builder. It's depressing, intense and mysterious. Very few films can create authentic atmospheric horror while developing their characters so well. Toni Colette is simply amazing and even surpassed her previous roles, such as her acclaimed performance in the 'Sixth Sense'. She deserves, at the very least, an Academy Award nomination for Best Leading Actress. Other standouts are the score, production design, cinematography, sound mixing and screenplay (again, with the exclusion of that ridiculous ending). I can imagine this film having nominations in any of the abovementioned categories.Nevertheless, it can be said that this film is (possibly) the biggest disappointment of the year. 'Hereditary' should be used as an example on what to do (and particularly not to do) with a screenplay. Most importantly, it is fundamental not to betray the audience especially when it has been carried out such a long way! A film with such potential, regardless of any technical qualities it may have, must always seek coherence in narrative and originality from beginning to end. There really was no need to use so many (cheap) supernatural elements to give the movie a decent ending. This film, even surreal at times, was already more than terrifying before it reached climax. Even when the story is complex and dark-toned, prioritising simplicity throughout the whole plot will always be far more efficient than any 'shocker' ending.Score: 6.5/10FJ Medina",7,0,1,14 September 2018
A Star Is Born," A Star is Re-Born
","I haven't seen any of the previous versions of 'A Star Is Born' but I can say that this film pays great tribute to its predecessors. For a story that has been told in many ways and different eras, I believe that the power and authenticity of Bradley Cooper's remake is outstanding. His omnipresence in the development of this film demonstrates not only his remarkable creative and directorial capabilities, but also proves that he can make anything happen. Same thing with Lady Gaga.I was always aware of Gaga's versatility as an artist and her passion for acting. However, her involvement and delivery in the film is absolutely breathtaking. Not only she is the queen of music, but also is one of the best actresses nowadays. I wouldn't be surprised if her career follows the same path as Cher or Streisand herself. Not to mention that the soundtrack (co-produced by Gaga) has already made history as a chart-topper. Every song in this film has been beautifully crafted to enhance every moment of this masterpiece. My personal favourites are 'Shallow', 'Always Remember Us This Way', 'Is That Alright?', 'Before I Cry' and 'I'll Never Love Again'. The last song already is the 'I'll Always Love You' of today.I had high expectations for this film given the critical acclaim and box-office reception. I can say that these expectations were met and surpassed. I was also impressed on the chemistry between Cooper and Gaga. They really converged magnificently. The only issue I perceived is that the story focuses too much on Jack's (Cooper) demise. Ally's (Gaga) character doesn't fully develop as it should. Nevertheless, Gaga's performance is of such greatness, that it's easy to notice how she progressively steals the film.In summary, this is a beautiful film. As said before, acting is amazing. Cooper, Gaga and Sam Elliot will get tonnes of awards. Cooper did incredibly well for a directorial debut and production, but awards in these fields will come with further projects. Highlights are music, editing, cinematography, sound mixing and sound editing. I anticipate 10 Academy Award Nominations at the very least, including Best Motion Picture. It will win a handful of Golden Globes, including Best Picture. Hard to tell at this stage if it will win Best Picture at the Oscars, but will definitely win Best Original Song for 'Shallow' or any of the aforementioned themes. Given the relatively low competition this year, I anticipate that it will grab 3 Oscars minimum.The story of 'A Star Is Born' deserves to be told over and over. If it is revisited in 30 or 40 years, it will have to surpass the high standards set by this film. I highly recommend watching this movie on the big screen, you will enjoy every second and it will stay with you for long.Score: 9.5/10FJ Medina",10,1,3,18 October 2018
Us," Message could not be delivered
","Honestly, I wasn't expecting an amazing film as I was already a bit disappointed with 'Get Out'. I believe that 'Us' offers an original premise and is very intriguing at the beginning. Technical aspects are great. Some shots are amazingly well executed with eerie score and beautiful cinematographic work.Just like Tony Collette in Hereditary, Lupita Nyong'o is the heart and soul of a film that without a female lead, wouldn't even be worth watching. I believe that Jordan Peele really overcooked this film, creating an exaggerated story that didn't get anywhere.He tried to repeat the 'Get Out' formula, but luck wasn't on his side this time. More importantly, he saturated the film with so many unnecessary symbolic references, that created massive confusion and discomfort. I'm not sure the film is worth watching twice, but I may give it another chance...Score: 6.5/10FJ Medina",7,1,1,18 April 2019
Bohemian Rhapsody," Fun but Inaccurate Biopic
","'Bohemian Rhapsody' is not as bad as critics say, but it is not Oscar-worthy either. Many of us are aware that this film was involved in numerous unconventional production delays. Therefore, the efforts are acknowledged given that the final product is more than acceptable. Nevertheless, the main issue with this film relies in the many inaccuracies of the story, which led to an incoherent (and even offensive) narrative for those who are truly familiarised with the always-known story of the rockstar in question.Biopics are highly tricky, if not, risky. There are always going to be differing versions and opinions. People who knew Queen's story in detail are naturally in discomfort with a film that rather than paying tribute to the band's lead member, focuses on turning things around in favour of the 'victims' (i.e. the other band members). It's no surprise that the screenplay was wrecked by a still-envious band, who portrayed Mercury not only as a middle-class bloke, but also (naively) attempted to lie to the audience by showing a weak-er, almost narcissistic Mercury, who does not relate intimately to the real persona. I have to admit that it is very interesting to see how film, as a mass media mechanism, can be used for some filthy purposes such as contentious advertising, political campaigning and false storytelling (-cough-).For the sake of clarity, let's just review Mercury's origin. He came from a notorious, if not relatively wealthy family. He never had to work his way up as shown in the film. More importantly, Mercury never, ever had to beg for anything (as if!). In fact, others (including the less hot band members) were the ones always begging. By the way, this includes the fictitious dispute between Mercury and the other members regarding their participation in the Live Aid Concert. Given these reasons, the critics got it right.In contrast, I think that critics overreacted with the so-called straightwashing of Mercury. I believe the film balanced very well Mercury's love and sex life, without falling into the nostalgic or bizarre. Mostly everyone knows how this character played and decayed. Therefore, the film did well by focusing on the artist rather than on the gay man. We will always love Mercury, no matter straight, bisexual or gay. In this case, the public's opinion prevails.In a more technical note, the film does not have many cinematic qualities. It feels more like a TV-movie rather than a film aimed for the big screen. Aside from Rami Malek's exceptional characterisation, the only other highlights are sound mixing and make-up/costume design. However, for a film of this scale, editing and cinematography appeared amateurish, if not, mediocre. Screenwriting was hacked as noted above. Directing does not go too far either, hence, the reductive feel of the film.In conclusion, 'Bohemian Rhapsody' was a good attempt. It is entertaining and well-acted. More importantly, it is brave and controversial (as Queen itself). Future biopics could perhaps focus more on Mercury to try to repair the inaccuracies (or lies) set by this film. A good title for a more loyal version could just be 'Freddie' or 'Mercury'. Anyway, we all know that Queen was all about him. I went to see the film with low expectations and had a fairly good time. It was inevitable not to spot the cracks, but the Live Aid Concert at the end redeems for most of the flaws. Malek should win almost every award as he saved this film. The rest of the discrepancies will probably be discussed until box-office closure, for which I anticipate a worldwide gross of half a billion minimum.Score: 7.5/10FJ Medina",8,2,4,16 November 2018
Bird Box," Perfect Netflix film for a Sunday night
","For anyone interested in Bird Box, I suggest ignoring the bad comments and enjoying the film. I agree that there may be a bit of over hype, however, this film simply is what it is. It's one of Netflix's best selling products, it has Sandra Bullock and John Malkovich on it, and it must certainly deliver a sequel.For those comparing this film to A Quiet Place, I would say that Bird Box is better. A Quiet Place is the one that is very much overrated! I agree that A Quiet Place is a good film, but can't deny it seems like a reboot to the Cloverfield franchise. Bird Box is a much better dystopian film and, in my opinion, is very well adapted from the novel. Bird Box might not have the technical qualities of A Quiet Place, but at least is much more fun and thrilling.I admit that there may be some loose ends and clichÃ©s typical to the genre. However, let's all be realistic and acknowledge this film for what it is. If you really want to watch an outstanding apocalyptic thriller, please refer to Children of Men, Dark City, Blade Runner and the like.Score: 7.5/10FJ Medina",8,1,7,9 January 2019
Climax," Electro-Dance Madness
","Climax is an intense and hallucinating experience. I watched this film at the Sydney Film Festival last year and still can't get over it. In my opinion, Climax must be the second or third best film I watched in 2018. Once again, Gaspar Noe has reinvented his very characteristic style to create another unconventional arthouse film. As most of Noe's films, Climax is disturbing, polarising and highly controversial. Meaning that it's not a film for everyone. Having said that, for the ones that appreciate experimental cinema, this is a must-see.Climax is an absolute audio-visual feast. The dance sequences, beats and long shots are beautifully assembled, creating a hypnotising and electrifying spectacle. As the film unfolds, the characters all fall into a frightening atmosphere of tension and death. Climax represents the multiplicity of human emotions at the same time: euphoria, joy, sadness, surprise and fear. Every frame of this film is composed with amazing cinematography and perfect editing. This is a film to be watched on the big screen with the best audio system. Climax is an absolute masterpiece and I will never forget it.Score: 10/10FJ Medina",10,19,38,1 March 2019
The Favourite," The Favourite is my favourite
","Let me begin by saying that this is the best film of the year. The Favourite is simply exquisite, mischievous and irreverent. I've followed Yorgos Lanthimos since The Lobster, and with this film he has proven to be one of the most original filmmakers today.Everything about The Favourite is perfect. Since I saw the trailer, it was love at first sight. The acting ensemble is absolutely phenomenal. I refer not only to the trio of ladies, but also to Nicholas Hoult. I would nominate them all for their performances. However, the Oscar belongs to Olivia Colman. Her performance has to be one of the best I've seen in recent years.The Favorite is a true masterpiece because it's unique, eccentric and politically incorrect. In my opinion, it's art in one of its most rare forms. I would easily give this film over 10 Academy Award nominations, with a total of 5 definite wins for Best Motion Picture, Best Director, Best Leading Actress (Colman), Original Screenplay and Production Design.Nevertheless, I doubt The Favourite will win the Oscar for Best Picture as Green Book and Roma have swept most award shows. Regardless, The Favourite will stand the test of time as the cult film it is. The Favourite is one of the best examples why the seventh art is still alive.Score: 10/10FJ Medina",10,5,14,11 January 2019
Cold War," Not quite what I was expecting
","I have to admit that this film was extremely well marketed for what it really is. Honestly, Cold War is not the masterpiece one would expect. Acting and directing are exceptional. Also, the black and white cinematography gives great style to the film. However, the screenplay falls short and film editing, in my opinion, is flawed.I think Cold War was very close to be an amazing film. The main issue is that the characters have no depth, therefore, the story feels empty and unrealistic. Even when many assumptions can be made throughout the film, the love story between the main characters seems hard to believe.For an 88 minute film, Cold War feels very slow paced and boring. I felt there was no substance or emotion that could really captivate the audience. Finally, reusing the same song over and over got really annoying. I can't say I recommend this film, but acknowledge the effort of its creators. I haven't seen all the films in the race for the foreign film Oscar. However, I doubt Cold War deserves a nomination.Score: 6.5/10FJ Medina",7,3,7,14 January 2019
Joker," An honest Joker
","Whether you loved or hated this film, one thing is true: the Joker doesn't get any more real than this. This Joker is almost everything I was expecting: it's dark, honest and disturbing. Please note that this film is not intended for the average comic moviegoer. If you liked The Avengers, it's very likely that you won't get this film (no offence). The Joker is made for a more segmented (and clever) audience and is here to make a statement. In my opinion it could have been a bit darker and gory. However, it has definitely made an impact and will become the benchmark of many other comic-based dramas to come. Without a doubt, this film is one of the year's best.Score: 9/10

Green Book," This film might steal the Oscars night
","Green Book is undoubtedly one of the year's best. This film ticks all the right boxes: exceptional performances, great story and powerful message. I believe this is one of the strongest contenders for the Oscar race and wouldn't be surprised if it wins Best Picture.Both Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali give their best performances to date, particularly Mortensen. However, Ali is the one that may take the Oscar as he is in the race for Supporting Actor. Other stand outs are direction, screenplay, score, cinematography, editing and production design. It might end up with 6 or 7 Academy Award nominations on top of the 3 Golden Globes that has already won.I watched this film during the New Year's Eve premiere and had a terrific time. Overall, it's a very enjoyable and positive film, it touches many topics which are relevant today and that's why Green Book is magic.Score: 10/10FJ Medina",10,2,6,9 January 2019
