The Blair Witch Project," Nothing more then a few a scares. ( It's probably all you're going to want, anyways)
","This movie is slow. S-L-O-W. So slow, I thought it was on for an hour a half, and it was only on half hour. And virtually nothing happens the first half hour. A few people share their discussion on the legend of the haunted woods. Knuckleheads actually go there. One forgets the compass, loses the map, and hence, they get lost in the last place that they want to get lost. ( Maybe if they just walked in the direction that they parked the car....just saying.) Then, the signs begin to show. The haunted woods, of course. Something likes to move rocks around , 'This rock wasn't here before, I'm positive!' Oh, that rock? That's because I kicked that rock in anger, when you told me you didn't have the map, that's why that rock moved! It's a boring movie, but...it does deliver some chilling scares. Forget about the plot and story, are you looking to be frightened? Blair Witch is probably your cup of tea. And get used to the trees, you're going to be seeing a lot of them. ( Don't mind the body count, either.)",6,1,1,6 March 2020
The Benchwarmers," The Benchwarmers. A dumb baseball comedy about dumb people who play it.
","I don't know what more you want to know about this. I'm not here to knock it, and it's certainly not a knock out of the ballpark. If you ask me, its not even game day here. Maybe it would have been a lot better and a lot funnier if you didn't have Nick Swardson doing the writing for you. Just saying. This low intelligent comedy features David Spade ( with about the most ridiculous hair cut I've ever seen him in! Did he get paid extra to do that?) and John Heder, not that this makes it any more comical. Filled with slurs straight from the third grade, this is nothing more then a comic effort about the bullies vs the dweebs. I was actually rooting for the bullies here, since the dweebs weren't smart enough to stay at home. I guess were suppose to laugh at full grown adults getting teased and picked on by other full grown adults. Then again, this is Happy Madison, intelligence isn't a factor for this neck of the woods. Doesn't work for me. I give this 5 out of 10 stars. And, just a footnote, Nick has no talent. None. This shows.",5,0,1,30 April 2020
Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Spoiler ahead!!!!!!!!
","I'm going to get the ****SPOILER***** out of the way right now, so please disregard this review if you don't want to know. I mean it! I'm about to say it! I'm not joking! SPOILER!!! Okay, you ready? Elle Driver gets her remaining eye ripped out and stepped on, so no surgical procedures to put it back in are possible. Kill Bill Vol 2, tremendously less violent then the original, however, its all in the name of concentrating on story instead of action here. That's not to say Kill Bill Vol 2 wimps out on the action, its just not nonstop this time. The movie continues where Vol 1 left off, The Bride continuing her quest to end the life of Bill once and for all. A lot of years have went by, and the baby is no longer a baby, now a child, and Bill being a daddy is NOT going to stop The Bride from putting a serious dent in his future plans, if you catch my drift. We get to see a spectacular scene of The Bride in training with an old man. In some ways, Vol 2 is better then the original, I didn't like it at first as well because the violence was toned down, but if you treat them both as one movie, you should be able to accept it. 8 out of 10 stars! POWERFUL ENDING!!!!!",8,1,2,15 February 2020
Scarface," Am I the only one who gave this such a low rating???
","F bomb. Cocaine shoot. Shoot from the gun. F bomb. Cocaine shoot. Shoot from the gun. F bomb, F bomb, F bomb, cocaine, cocaine cocaine, F bomb, F bomb, F bomb, F bomb, more cocaine, more shooting, screaming, yelling, SAY HELLO TO MY LITTLE FRIEND, F bomb, F bomb, F bomb, cocaine, cocaine, cocaine, more yelling, more screaming, screaming on the payphone, pool scene, or is that a tub scene, a scene with him in the water, how about that, F bomb, F bomb, F bomb, cocaine, cocaine, shoot, shoot them up, F bomb, F bomb, F bomb....seriously, people how is this even close to being an 8 star film! Scarface is a senseless, violent pic of a man who is broken and emotionally unstable, hyper as is, and makes himself more hyper on cocaine rushes, and shoots a bunch of people when he's angry. Did I miss anything? If anything needs shot in the face, its the film itself. I saw nothing good, nothing smart, nothing GOOD, more then anything. Okay. Enough said, that's Scarface, everyone. Oh, and its close to a 3 hour movie. Or was it over 3 hours? Felt like a 5 hour movie. I'm shooting Scarface with 4 stars. SAY HELLO TO YOUR LITTLE RATING!",4,2,4,19 April 2019
Alien 3," Time for Ripley to go at it again!
","You know what, just shut up, okaaayyy? We all know Alien 3 didn't stand a chance of being as good as the original or even a fighting shot of being as explosive as Aliens. So get over it. As far as I'm concerned, Aliens more then made up for the original, and all the sequels that came after put together, so just forgive them, or forget them. Alien 3 finds Ripley on an all male, prison planet, and unfortunately, she didn't come alone. She came with an alien monster. Get rid of it, you say? Impossible. It's living inside her. Now what? Not only is she a threat to the all male prison planet, but she's also a danger to their human existance, as long as that alien lives inside her. She now has a death wish. Meanwhile, they have a brand new problem....this being a prison, what do you think the chances are of having weapons around to use against the alien colonies this time? Interesting script, but fails to bring the goods of the original, so just get over that hurdle. It has a fun tag along to the continuity. You think you can do better? Bring it. If I have any complaint, it's just the camera angles sometimes made me dizzy, going around in circles, upside down toward fans and etc, etc....I was starting to get sick. And Alien 3 didn't come without some unique scares and gore effects for you, so just accept this as one of the better of the sequels that came AFTER this one, and stop looking at it as 'It's not as good as Alien or Aliens.' The main strength of Alien 3, make that two strengths.....Weavers performance, mind blowing once again, and the directors efforts. Together, they did the best they could. And that's good enough for me.",5,0,1,21 April 2020
10 Cloverfield Lane," Decent mystery thriller
","A woman survives a near fatal car accident, and recovers to find herself in unfamiliar territory. It almost looks and feels like shes in a prison cell, she's even served trays of food in the same manner. Not knowing what's going on, she quickly turns on her kidnappers, but the attack is intercepted, and she is strongly cautioned NOT to do that again. Her kidnappers seem to understand that she's scared, and that she's still coming to her senses, but they soon set her straight: She's no longer on the Earths surface. They tell her that she's so many feet under the ground, and that she is safe, that the world is no longer safe for human existence. The story seems believable, but can her kidnappers be trusted? What's their true motives, their REAL intentions here? Eventually, they allow her out of the prison like cell, and bring her into more comforting enviroment. She's allowed to watch anything on the DVD player, etc...and from here, the film sends us mixed signals on what I would call....forced trust. She has no choice but to trust these people? The alternative is escape, but what if they are telling the truth about what's going on on the Earths surface? if they're lying, is this is a chance you can really take? The film sets a terrifying setting of absolute entrapment....and the viewer is left watching with an uneasy feeling that something just isn't right, but what the hell is wrong? John Goodman, as usual, plays an outstanding performance as one of the kidnappers, and his actions plays off to the viewer that his portrayal can go either way, you can easily see him as a friend just as much as you can see him being an enemy, but which is it? This mystery thriller is stylish, slick, and almost perfect in a lot of ways, but for reasons that I have to leave out so that I don't spoil the ending, I am giving this 6 stars. This film was on the right track to being AWESOME, and had the writers or filmmakers had given it just a little bit more thought, this could have been a perfect film for what it stands, however, I was a bit letdown with the ending. I'm okay with the way it ended, don't get me wrong, but had there been a little more thought, there was a more creative way that this could have all been played out for the final ending. For the most part, this is an 8 star film, but I'm demolishing it down to 6 for reasons that I cannot say, I cannot speak, I cannot spoil anything for you. Just sit back, relax, and enjoy the tense mystery. See if you can figure it out.",6,0,0,25 November 2019
Ghost," He's come back as a ghost. Not to haunt. Not to scare. To warn and protect.
","Ghost is the story about a young couple, Sam and Molly ( Swayze and Moore, respectively) who have a relationship together. A childless couple, and if it wasn't for the fact that Molly can't get Sam to say 'I love you' back, they would be a perfect duo together. Things get tragic when Sam is left for dead after a night at the play, and Sam is left chasing the perp off, only to return and find that hes staring at his own dead body. Realizing what has happened, a very shocked spirit of Sam is left wondering, wandering, and hoping for the best for Molly, who he still loves dearly. The plot thickens when Sam, unseen, finds the perp has returned to Mollys apartment, and seems to be looking for something, but what? He has no way of warning Molly about this, but he quickly learns how to manipulate situations. For example, he scares the cat, and the cat runs, accidentally clawing the perp out of the apartment. If only Sam could learn how to move objects. If only he could talk! If only there was....help. He soon gets help, through the living and dead. The living? A fake psychic who comes from a long history of real psychics, and it seems to have skipped a generation. The only talent she has, that Sam can utilize, is that she can hear Sam, but cannot see him. The dead? A ghost like him on a subway trains him reluctantly how to move objects. With the help of these two, Sams ghost helps to combat, warn, and protect Molly from danger and from the outcome that happened to him the night they were together. Ghost is a pretty powerful film, especially coming from Zucker. It can get incredibly intense, not just in motion, but when the music picks up. Oh yeah. I used to own the Ghost soundtrack, its for sure worth the listen. Most of it is the music from the film, including the Unchained Melody song. I would imagine its rare now, but if you can find a copy, its for sure worth owning. Film came out in 1990, but the soundtrack wasn't released until five years later. This is one of those films that runs over 2 hours, and you do not feel it tick away for a minute. It gets sad at times, but the humor side of it all never keeps you down for too long, seems to have perfect ( if not, almost) balance and harmony. This was one of my favorite Patrick Swayze films, I even enjoyed this better then Road House. A film from Paramount, Ghost earns 8 out of 10 stars from me. Bring on the after life!",8,2,2,20 August 2019
E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," add a little dark magic to your heart
","Say what you will, but ET is a pretty dark film. It's an adventure you won't ever forget. A great family film for all ages, however, it boasts a dark nature and very stressful themes. ET has been left behind, a space botanist going from planet to planet, collecting flower life from each visit, but an investigation from government officials has caused the spaceship to leave, leaving ET all behind to his own devices. He doesn't know where he's at, he has nowhere to go....until Ellliot finds him, and gives a home, a secret kept from his divorced mother. The film is happy and sadness melded into one. The film is almost all magical, along with the music, the story, the cinematography, and the humor. The story mainly revolves around trying to keep ET safe from enemies ( and there's plenty of those) along with trying to find a way to get him back home. I can't see anyone not liking this movie.",8,4,5,4 December 2019
It," not scary at all
","I went in to go see IT with full intentions on giving this 8 stars or better. Unfortunately, I found this to be more disappointment then enjoyment. I will explain the good and bad, but first, I want to point out that this review is based solely on the movie itself. By that, I mean that I will not compare this to the 1990 TV movie. I will, however, compare with the book, which is where I did feel a bit let down. I do understand, there is no way you can condense the widths and depths of the book into a 2 hour, 15 minute film. ( This is why it is secretly divided to an unclosed number of films, but I can only base the review on what I saw here.) At first, IT was promising, the first 10 minutes revives the story faithfully to the opening of the book, giving a feel that they are on the right track. Everything seems spot on, and we get a first glimpse of Skargards performance as Pennywise, the child killing clown who dwells in the sewers of Derry, Maine. He is incredibly chilling, and you think to yourself...this will be good! Then you get the opening title screen, provided you have bypassed the most brutal scene in the entire movie. From there, it all falls apart, and I mean...there just seems to be no direction, not much of a plot, the 'where do we go from here?' feeling. I did not expect this. We all waited a very long time for this movie to be released in theaters, and I was let down by the feeling that not enough time and effort was put forth in reassuring us that everything would have been handled well and with care. I was let down. Bills performance as Pennywise was quite strong, but he has a (at most) 8 minutes of screening time in the entire 2 hours and 15 minutes of the film. Most of it was a lot of shape shifting, and sometimes he was just doing weird things to try to make us laugh, rather then being scary, so it through me off as to how they were intending on us to react to the movie altogether. This clown can be scary as hell, most will just see him as a weird clown, but it is safe to assume the film does not rely heavily on his performance. The gore? It's not as gory as you may expect, however, when it does happen, it tends to be a bit over the top...one scene in particular, and this is where I resent to say the film falls victim to the whole CGI crap, which downgrades the film quite a bit. I grew up in a time when we didn't use CGI. We did not need it then, and we do not need it now, and it certainly did not belong in IT. How scary was it? If you have seen 10 scary movies in your lifetime, you are prepared for IT. If you have seen 20 scary movies, you will see absolutely nothing new here. Nothing. Familiar jump scares, you should be immune to it. I was. Somewhat. Now...the plot. This is where it all falls apart. There seems to be no direction. The good chunk of the movie revolves around the bully kids fighting with the good kids, and Beverly takes up way too much of the films time. Needless. Parents are barely in the movie. Effortless. I do not know what the plans are for the next film, but I do hope it ties things together. It was a bit emotional, which I liked. A scene, for example, shows a girl signing the cast of one of the kids, she signs it LOSER...Beverly changes the S to an V....so cute. Humor lightens the mood, and the kids did an amazing job putting the film to life. However! There are unforgiving moments. I couldn't forgive the CGI. And it was unfaithful to the book. All in all, it was a fair shot in the making, they had one shot at glory, and if they missed...well, I suppose I can forgive them for that. 6 out of 10 from me!",6,24,46,9 September 2017
Who Framed Roger Rabbit," ballsy movie for Disney, especially for its time
","Who Framed Roger Rabbit....what a ride this was. The film is part animated, part live action, and takes place in two areas. One area, the real world, our world, and on the other side of the road, lies Toon Town. Detective Eddie Valiant hates Toon Town, he won't go there. In fact, he hates toons, all toons, in general. Why? His brother was killed by a toon, and he holds a strange vendetta against all toons who cross his path. ( He doesn't even take kindly to Betty Boops appearance that she makes later in the film) When poor Roger Rabbit gets framed for a crime that he didn't commit, its up to Eddie Valiant to get to the bottom of the case, and prove Rogers innocence. At first, Eddie is a little reluctant, but after a tip is confirmed by the baby, and he finds out who Roger is married to ( the overly sexy Jessica Rabbit) he decides to help him out, even if it means his over exposure to toons in general. Don't expect his attitude to lighten up much, though. Along the way, there are crimes, another set up, and some strange events that Eddie is not letting go unnoticed. As Eddie gets deeper and deeper involved, he finds his own life in jeopardy, and how much longer Roger can be kept alive seems to be diminishing, and gets even more complicated when Jessica Rabbit herself becomes involved in the case. And it cannot be denied that something is going on in Toon Town, and its bringing the noise here in the real world with it. Can Detective Eddie Valiant save both the live and toon world from whatever evil is brewing? And finally, what's with Judge Doom? How does he tie in with all this fiasco? This isn't going to be an easy nut for Mr. Valiant to crack here. For what its worth, and considering the time it came out, Who Framed Roger Rabbit blew it out of the pond with this feature. Still does to this day, it can be appreciated for a time when Disney was fantastic at making films. The combination of live and cartoon action is blended in here seamlessly, and what would a great film be without the legendary Robert Zemeckisis as our director? Get yourself enough popcorn to get you through to the end, Who Framed Roger Rabbit is going to entertain you ( and make you laugh out loud) right to the very end. PS: Ending was no less then shocking!",8,2,2,31 January 2020
Unbreakable," Interesting concept. Bad execution.
","Unbreakable features Bruce Willis as a man who has miraculously survived an accident that's left everyone for dead except for him. Soon, he discovers that he just may be 'unbreakable', after he experiments with himself with some tests. For example, he bench presses an astonishing number of weights that would have shattered an average mans arm into a number of pieces, but NOT him. Another man ( Jackson) explains to him, in his own words of course, that sometimes a mind is perfectly built, so therefore, the body is perfectly built, and hereby unbreakable. The movie has an interesting concept, but the execution here is poorly done. What could have been a riveting story with rich, complex characters, instead, Unbreakable just decides to go the psychological route. Which I wouldn't go out of my way and say that it was lazy, because the movie does work, I just think it was a waste. For the psychological route that it takes, you may have to watch this more then once before you really get the gist of it. It's mainly about how he does or doesn't go on a big ego trip over his extraordinary gift, and the aspects of it. Cinematography was amazing for this film, and I just wish it would have had more depth to the story. With that said, some viewers may find this movie slow or even boring, which I disagree with. I didn't think it was slow or boring at all, I thought it was pretty inventive. Bruce Willis does an incredible job mastering the role, he really seems to get into character, which I love. There's downfalls, it's not a perfect movie, but it was well rounded to say the least, and I enjoyed it for the most part. I'm giving Unbreakable 6 out of 10 stars.",6,1,1,13 January 2020
Fight Club," with over 3,000 reviews, this movie does NOT need another
","So why am I giving it one? Simple. I do not believe that it is worth all the hype it gets to this day. The film is loaded with problems, varying from one extreme to another, and fans of this favorite will gladly overlook these problems, or will be quick to defend it with their means of logic and common sense. Wonderful. The problems of the film that are apparent, are as follows, and certainly not limited to: 1. Overabundance of masculine energy! Sure, you know what you are getting yourself into when the movie is titled as so, but it cannot be denied that it is just 'too much of a good thing.' Sugar is great, but do you want your drink drowning in it? 2. Disturbingly violent. And I am used to violence in film. The manner in which it is displayed, however, makes a world of difference. The realism of the violence is there, and most of it seems needless. 3. No set direction for the story to go. The film, instead, relies heavily on layers of several 'WTF' moments, one after the other. Some believe this is just part of the mystery, but I tend to disagree. 4. Not logical. Not logical at all. Which part? Any of it. Take a quick research look into mental illness, anti social behavior, not to mention the ungodly ending to this film. None of it adds up. So I did not come here to bash this work. Simply put, I believe it is over rated. Severely. I do get the point the movie tries to get across, he only fights one person in the entire movie. He fights himself. He cannot cope with the fact...how can I be all these people, and have all these jobs? It's because you don't sleep, you're all but one entity. As we are all. Was the ending real, or was that all made up in the insanity within himself? Many questions are asked, but we do not get the answers. The film just chooses not to deliver them. I do have some things that I love about Fight Club. The cinematography is excellent. And the movie is loaded to the brim with very intelligent quotes. 'On a long enough time line, the survival rate for everyone drops to zero.' Love that line! And yet, people still decide to waste their time watching TV. The casting was good, I thought it could do without Meat Loaf, but that's just my opinion. The story itself is a bit weak, almost too weak. The movie over extends itself past boundaries it should not surpass, and yet it is saved each time by another element that actually makes the film work. Weather it was by trial and error, or intended, does not matter, the film does work well with its components, each gear seems to turn another, and yet it does ABSOLUTELY NOTHING to master anything as a whole. Hidden away some place safe, is the emotional part to this movie. It does a good job hiding it away, preserving the 'manly' feel of this all. I admit, I am more in touch with my feminine side, which is probably the reason why Fight Club does nothing for me. It cannot be denied that this film is just not worth the hype it has, and yet on the same token, it has earned it. I just want to point out this film bombed at the box office in 1999, and if you do not believe me, look at how much the budget is, and compare it to the gross. See? Lost a lot of money. I understand fully that this is a favorite among many, and I understand many may be seeing this a little more different then the way I am seeing it. Well. Now. That is why there's over 3,000 reviews, now isn't it?",7,0,0,31 October 2017
Monster," Incredibly and masterfully done!
","Monster will grip you, captivate you, seize every emotion in your body, and then....it will disturb you for years to come. Patty Jenkins did an excellent job directing this title, and all actors and actresses did their part in making this is a well made film. Monster is the true story about Aileen, a Florida women who was put to death by lethal injection in 2002 after finally being caught for the murder of several men. Simply put, circumstances turned her into a brutal, man killing monster, and the film follows the tragic events that led up to such an event. It's not really her fault that one man can mess your mind up to be driven to commit horrific slaughter as such, and the drastic measures that the state takes can be questionable. Many will have have their own thoughts, opinions, and beliefs after watching this film, and its very important that everyone has some kind of respect for each others thoughts, opinions, and beliefs, because the way I see it, there's no right or wrong answer here. I appreciate a lot of the reviews on this site, I have read several, and I love that everyone has different points and takes on the film, in ways that I would have never viewed or looked at it, something ( if not everything) has worked here. Its designed to be controversial. It's designed to shock and disturb you. And there aren't any words to describe the surreal feeling that this movie manages to capture, toying with your every thought and emotion. Some may feel sorry for Aileen. Others may despise her. Some may see her as a monster. Others may see her as a hero. I, myself, cannot defend why she did what she did. Killing is wrong, murder is wrong, taking the law into your own hands is wrong, but on the same token, I truly understand why she did the killing. I understand why she did the murders. I understand why she took the law into her own hands. Female serial killers is rare, making up only 1% of the serial killers in America. Aileen was only the ninth or tenth woman to be executed, sentenced to death by lethal injection. The film is engrossing, and yet can be very difficult to watch by very sensitive viewers, especially the ones who may have been victims themselves. The film seems to silently beg for any of these victims to get help before any of these events take place. Besides, nobody, no matter what they've done to you, is worth dying over....your life has more value then anything that's taken place. I give Monster 8 out of possible 10 stars.'He who fights with monsters might care lest he thereby become a monster' A quote from Mark Twain.",8,2,2,29 November 2019
Captain Marvel," I'm DONE with Marvel!
","If this is the depths this studio has to sink to, so be it. Captain Marvel is not bad. It's not good either. Simply put: It's a movie I don't feel should have been made. Brie Larson was okay as the hero, she's actually not the one I had a problem with, although I had wished there was a better actress they could have cast as the lead. It's the LOUSY story line! Captain Marvel feels as if it doesn't have to have a great story, that they can just throw eye candy, and show you a bunch of 'oohhs' and 'ahhhhs' scenes, and that will be worth your money, right? WRONG! I have trusted Marvel for years, but now, as far as I'm concerned, Marvel is dead to me, along with Disney. I will no longer trust them with my hard earned money, in fact, i may be done with cinema, period. I should have known, the trailers didn't look appealing, and there's a reason: there is nothing in this film to write home about. Nothing! You can't talk about one scene around the water cooler tommorow: 'Remember the part when...' Forget it! It's a confirmed cash grab. Be warned! Many scenes, everything was happening so fast, I couldn't tell what the heavens was going on...and the movie got to a point where it was just too long! I had to see for myself, and I did. I wish I hadn't. Verdict is in: You will either love or hate this movie. There's no fence riding here. Which is why I give it 5 stars. Altogether, this was just bland, mediocore, and I'll just say it...I am SICK of Samuel L Jackson! Hope you thought this atrocity was worth losing a long time fan over, Marvel! Mark my words, I won't be the only one.",5,3,13,8 March 2019
The Fan," This fan doesn't blow cool air
","After a successful baseball player accepts a multi million dollar deal to join another baseball team, things go downhill fast. An obsessive fan gets involved to resolve the problem by taking things a little too far...and then a little further. The baseball player ( played by Wesley Snipes) says he doesn't care anymore, but the fan ( Robert De Niro) believes that he's not playing well because he doesn't have his lucky number from the last team he played....lucky number 13!13 is already taken, and the fan will do everything he can to get it back, but where is the line drawn in the sand from someone who wants to help, to becoming a vicious, psycho sociopath? Many parts of the film work quite well, however, it cannot be denied this is a forgettable 1996 thriller that just gets easily dismissed due to its played out behaviors that we've seen in many other films. Nothing original, nothing new, nothing to remember. It's worth a look, but don't go expecting a masterpiece. You will be let down.",6,0,0,24 November 2019
12 Monkeys," Complex film...compelling film...very annoying film!
","To think! This was Terry Gilliams best selling movie to date. Twelve Monkeys is a creative, mind blowing, and very twisted tale that is prepared to mess around with your head for a few hours. ( It's what Terrys great at!) Bruce Willis is offered early parole, at a great cost....he must go back to the year 1996 to gather information on why the human population was almost completely wiped out. He goes back in time. Here's the kicker: He's in the wrong year! He's in the year 1990, and he's still trying to gather the information he needs. He returns to the year 2030 something, only to tell them that he wasn't in the year 1996, he was in the year 1990. He's asked if he wants to go back. At this point, were at the 45 minute mark to the movie. Twelve Monkeys makes it clear that this is NOT a time travel film such as The Terminator. Hence, in Terminator, they went back in time to prevent something from happening. Twelve Monkeys makes it clear that this event cannot be prevented, because its already happened, they're just looking for information as to what caused the problem. And you send him to the wrong year. Or was that the right year, and you wanted information from both years? See what I mean! This movie jacks with your brain a little bit. I'm cool with it, and I love the unique formula. However, there is just something incredibly annoying and confusing about Twelve Monkeys. It's complex, its' compelling, it's damn fun and entertaining to watch. So where's the problem? Well, there's not really any clear answers to our questions, especially when the film ends with its ( I don't dare spoil it!) ending. The viewer is left to their own devices to decide for themselves what they've watched. What's real, what's not, is any of it real, was the whole film just a dream, etc, etc, etc. Your left trying to find the missing pieces of the puzzle, never finding them, and you're trying to figure and make sense out of everything and nothing, which is flipping annoying if you ask me! Solid performances, cast and crew were great, the movie never drags or slags, doesn't bore you for one minute ( this is what I love about all of Terry Gilliams films), and when its all over, oh, you're going to be SHOCKED by the ending. I don't know, Twelve Monkeys. You work, but I don't know how you work. Trial and error. Maybe. I just have one question left unanswered about your movie. Twelve Monkeys. Which one of the twelve wrote your script?",7,0,1,20 April 2019
Rocky V," Rocky! Rocky! Rocky! Rocky! Rocky!
","Out of the Rocky series, this one is clearly the weakest link. However, I respect it enough to give it the credit it deserves. And that is, it supremely concludes and wraps up the Rocky series...period. ( Excluding the work done after this, of course. If there's no roman numeral involved, I do not consider it a true entry to the series.) There is no main event this time. There is no professional boxing match set up. Instead, Rocky V picks up exactly where Rocky IV left off. The fight just finished, Drago successfully defeated, however, it cost Rocky his entire career. His head battered from brutal blows to the head have left him brain damaged. And thanks to Pauly, he is now broke....and his life seems to be coming apart at the seams. From riches back down to the street gutter, he struggles to keep his family together, while temptations for the next bout keep lurking around the corner. He wants to fight a few more rounds, but Adrian knows any more damage to his head could cost him his life. Unfortunate for Rocky, because boxing is all he knows how to do. Into retirement, and wanting to do something, he is offered by an unlikely source a chance to redeem himself, by asking for his assistance in managing for him. That's Tommy Gunn. With nothing for either one of these gentlemen to lose, Rocky eventually agrees, and together, they quickly bond, and he begins training this young man. Problem is, Gunn seems to have anger issues, and he quickly turns on Rocky, and challenges him to a street fight. In the meantime, his own family is breaking apart. His own son is turning on him, Adrian doesn't agree with his points of view, and with his brain damage, he's fighting not in a ring this time, but fighting to keep his own sanity and family together. Rocky V may not have been a delight at the box office, or even fans of the series, but its important to view this as a film that wants to satisfy its fans by giving an ending to the series. At the time of release, they promised this was the last one. This one examines the heart and soul of Rocky himself, we get to know him better as a person. How is this failure? I wish fans and viewers can see the true meaning behind this movie, its actually quite deep, and if they failed to satisfy you, I am sure they are truly sorry. They didn't fail to satisfy me.",6,1,1,20 December 2018
"I Love You, Man"," A brave movie about a bro-mance....backed by the music of RUSH!!!!
","Great movie! I Love You, Man focuses in on the bro-mance between two straight guys who share more in common then they think. Backed by the music and actual concert clips from the group RUSH, and all you need to do from there is jam pack it full of fun and laughs. Check and check! What I loved about the movie was that it never stepped into the crude catagory. There's absolutely no nudity, if it wasn't for the language it probably wouldn't even be rated R. It safely walks the line of homophobia and homophobic themes without crossing the line, and yet not afraid to approach it either....well done! This is probably my favorite Paul Rudd film. It's time to let your girlfriend or wife watch their favorite chick flick, you and your buddy need to check this movie out together....trust me, you need to watch this with your male best friend to get the full benefits of this movie. That's the only mistake I made.",7,1,1,23 January 2020
Batman Returns," It doesn't live up to the expectations or standards of 1989 Batman
","There lies the problem with a lot of the negative reviews. As a direct sequel to 1989's Batman, it's an utter bomb. I am totally agreeing with that. However, as an independent film in its own catagory, I'm fine with Batman Returns. Normally I'm big on continuity, but come on people, this is Batman. If you're a fan of the comic books, and I grew up loving the comics, this movie has really only got a few flaws that I can easily overlook. Granted, they are MAJOR flaws, but I'm willing to bet a lot of the negative reviews are because of their own take on what they've watched, not the flaws. For that reason, forget about the mistakes they made, and just appreciate this as part of the Batman series. A lot of the 1 star reviews on here, for example, I don't think these people realize that they had to go a different direction for this movie. Joker is dead, okay, people, they had to go a different direction. You demanded more Batman, they gave it to you, and what do you all do? You just itch and complain about this that and the other thing. They brought in a new villian, The Penguin. Danny DeVito was great! What's wrong, don't like penguins? The major flaw? CATWOMAN!!! I think this is one of the major flaws, as they rushed in and introduced this character way too soon. What the hey, I thought it was all right. Action is there, Batman feel of it is there, its still Gotham, what more do we want here, people? Get yourself together, and just appreciate this for what it is. It's Batman, and its still Tim Burton here. It doesn't live up to the expectations or standards of 1989's Batman because it can't, the bar was set too incredibly high. All in all, I thought this was a fair shake on the series, I enjoyed it, even though I thought it was just a little too long. I've given Batman Returns 7 stars, maybe half a star more then it deserves, but I'm not rounding it off to 6. I have to make up for some of the slack that some other reviewers weren't willing to give it.",7,6,8,9 January 2020
Blade," WESLEY SNIPES: THE VAMPIRE SLAYER!!!
","The movie opens up in a night club, where music is playing, there's all sorts of dancing. Then the sprinklers go off, and instead of it shooting out water, its shooting out blood. Already, I got a sickening feeling that this was NOT going to be what I was expecting. Already, right off the bat, were introduced to Blade, slaying vampires left and right in brutal and grotesque ways. Necks are bitten, impalement galore. Looks like I found my favorite Snipes movie! AND THIS ISN'T IT! And no, I didn't read the comics , so don't ask. Altogether, people really seem to dig this movie to this day. I wasn't impressed. I thought it was over the top gory, and didn't focus in enough on the story, which is already confusing. Walked away with more questions then answers. which should never be the case...PERIOD...when watching any vampire movie. It's slick, I'll give it that. Good? I wouldn't go that far. I was hoping on a little more information on Blade himself, but instead, we go the bloodbath route, just killing left and right to the point where everything seems to be going so fast, I couldn't tell what was going on. if you love vampire movies, you'll probably dig Blade. If your a Snipes fan like me, you may dig it. If your a Snipes fan like me, but don't really dig overly violent vampire movies, you will probably be disappointed like I was. I'm giving Blade 5 and half stars. I'm in a good mood. We can round it off to 6. And no, I'm never going to watch Blade II.",6,1,2,13 January 2020
Creed," Legends are not born, they're made!
","There's two types of dreams. There's dreams that come true, and there's dreams that stay dreams. Creed is a story about a dream come true. It pursues the world of Adonis Johnson, the son of Apollo Creed, who was killed in the ring fighting the powerful Ivan Drago. Strongly motivated to continue his fathers legacy, he turns to some unlikely sources for help in training, both of them being the boxing gyms in the local area. Not finding this helpful enough, he eventually turns to Rocky himself for training. At first, Rocky is against it, explaining that he has retired from boxing and training. After he finds out that he is the son of Apollo, Rocky feels that maybe he's looking into the eyes of a champ in the making. Now wanting to be part of making that dream come true, Rocky teaches him everything he knows, and once again, the name Creed is back in the headlines. The story is so much more then boasting a legendary name and creating your own legacy. It's about putting everything to the side, and stopping at nothing to achieve your dreams and goals. It's not even about proving to everyone that you can do it, it's about proving to yourself that you can do it. I loved the scene, for example, when Rocky faces Creed in the mirror, and explains to him that he's looking at his toughest opponent, and how to take him down. I really saw this that Creed was looking in the mirror, and seeing the only person that was standing between him, and his quest to take down Conlin, the strongest boxer that's ever stepped in the ring to date. Then another problem emerges...Rocky is faced with a problem that may will affect him in a way that he has never been affected before. However, because Rocky has never really retired from fighting, he fights his way to see to it that Creed becomes who he deserves to be, dead or alive! Energetic, powerful, maybe even poetic, Creed will meet or exceed your expectations as a great film to watch together in the evening.",8,0,1,7 February 2019
Home Alone," He's got the house all to himself....and he's protecting it from two bumbling bandits!
","Macaulay Culkin stars as Kevin, a hapless 8 year old lad who was left alone at the house, when the family mad dashes out falling behind after sleeping in too late, and making a special trip out yonder for the holidays. This leaves Kevin all alone, and he thinks he 'made his family disappear' after an argument left him claiming that he wishes they would all just go away. So now what? Well, at first, its all fun and games, as he roams and zooms and gets into mischief, with nobody to stop him or tell him what to do. Then, it gets a little tricky: Two bumbling bandits ( Stern and Pesci) catch wind that he's all alone in the house, and they make plans to rob the house blind. I mean, what defense does an 8 year old have against them, anyways? Apparently you never met Kevin, who has more tricks up his sleeve then a magician, as he outsmarts, outplays, and sets up childish pranks and traps for them to fall in. It's a parade of laughs, but will Kevin successfully be able to keep the home safe before his family comes back, or will his luck run out? It's a must see for the entire family, an early 90's Christmas movie from writer John Hughes, and directed by Chris Columbus ( Adventures In Babysitting), Home Alone is sure to keep you laughing all the way to the finish line!",7,1,1,9 January 2020
Deadpool 2," haters? what did you expect?
","The reviews of this movie are really starting to get to me. The first 10 or 15 gave this less then five stars! People, its Dead Pool, what did you expect? They up the action, they up the violence, and what? Because there's no nudity, you guys give it a bad review? It's loaded with funny quotes, it has heart, it's quirky as all hell, and I think the film makers pulled this off quite brilliantly if you ask me. If you haters think you can do such a better job of making a better movie, be our guest! Start your own independent label, and let's start bashing your work, let's see how you enjoy getting your creativity getting kicked to the curb. I was sold on the movie from the opening lines: 'FORGET WOLEVERINE!' Said another way, of course, I can't say it here. From there, it's just non stop action, non stop violence, and non stop laughs. There's no female nudity in this one, so I guess it's just...not as good as the first one. ( Laughs loudly!) People, get bent! I would gladly go see this again, and I've never ever paid for a theater film twice in my life. Yah! It's that good. It's even jam packed with some fun surprises. Have fun watching!",8,9,23,21 May 2018
The Terminator," He's from the year 2029. He's going back 45 years. Pray your not on his list. He's...The Terminator!
","In 2029, a company called Skynet has created the ultimate machine, which later becomes machines. And then the machines take over the world. It's what happens when computers program themselves, and become the ultimate weapon against humanity. Lucky for us, there was a man named John Conner who led the war against the machines. And do you know what? He successfully defeated them! In order to alternate this 2029 reality, one of the machines, called a T-800, has been sent back to the year 1984, to eliminate Sarah Conner. That's correct. The T-800 is programmed kill Sarah Conner....not John Conner. Why, you ask? It's simple, go after the mother, that way, there's no evidence that John Conner ever existed. It's a no risk policy the machines obey by. Don't worry, there may be hope. Another source has been sent back to 1984, knowing what is happening, and does his best to protect Sarah Conner from the ruthless T-800, who has already killed two Sarah Conners. ( Three in the phone book. He didn't know which one was the real Sarah Conner. Take no prisoners. It's another no risk policy the machines obey by.) Altogether, you got a hell of a blackjack with The Terminator, which combines non stop sci fi action along with violence and jaw dropping special effects. The Terminator and T2: Judgment Day are, unarguably, the only two great films in the entire Terminator franchise. The Terminator is a great movie, but T2 blows this film out of the water. I'm giving this classic, action packed rollercoaster of a ride 8 out of 10 stars. Remember....he'll be back!!!",8,1,3,29 December 2019
"I, Tonya"," great biography that tells the truth
","I usually do not get into biographies. The main problem I have with biographies is that they tell the life of a celebrity that I really do not care much about in the first place. I, Tonya won me over with the trailers. By the time I was done watching the film, I was more then won over. I was conquered. This was very well done. Its packed with live footage, commentary, and raw emotion, and never steers away from feeling like an actual movie rather then just a bunch of facts and lots of talking. To lighten the mood, it has the right elements of humor added. The mood had to be lightened for me, because I found this to be a very sad movie. If you've ever judged Tonya for what she did or did not do way back in 1994, you really need to watch this movie. Do you know that at the time this happened, I remembered a media coverage saying that Tonya was the one who hit Nancy with the stick. It wasn't her. It cannot be denied that Tonya got screwed, double screwed, and triple screwed along with her triple jump, which she is the first woman who performed such a trick. She got screwed by the media with their false accusations. She got double screwed by a court that unjustifiably put the heat on her, instead of the real culprits. And she got triple screwed by having such a controlling, manipulative  mother. I loved I, Tonya for what it was. It follows her from three and a half years old, all the way to her laughingstock boxing career. I found this a great treat, as it cleared up a lot of the bogus lies the media was feeding us at the time. Again, I found this altogether a very sad movie, I did feel very sorry for Tonya, but the film serves its purpose...if you're ever wondering what really happened, and what has happened since then, to Tonya, you will not be disappointed with I, Tonya. The movie also has a great soundtrack.",8,6,11,23 April 2018
Spider-Man: Homecoming," get in touch with your inner child, and enjoy the pants off this one!
","I didn't think I'd like this movie, but I ended up LOVING it! At first, it began a little awkward, it certainly didn't feel like a Spider-man film. By the end, I was laughing, crying, smiling, and cheering all at the same time. This is my favorite Spider-man movie. Sure, at the core of it all, it's childish, so what? What I love about it the most, is that its a whole. ( Meaning, it's complete without the need for countless sequels. Unlike some other franchises we know.) I have very little complaints, other then maybe it was ten to fifteen minutes too long, I think this was a perfect blend of comedy, emotional value, and family entertainment all combined in one. Well, what are you waiting for! Rent this out, and enjoy one of the best Spidey films yet!",8,0,0,4 December 2018
The Bodyguard," Good movie! So why isn't the rating a little higher?
","Well, I have a theory. It could have something to do with the length of the film. In general, this could have easily be all wrapped up around the hour and half mark, but instead the writer and filmmakers decide to stretch this out with long, and often times boring scenery. They think that they can make it up to us with amazing and dazzling lighting, and engaging with powerful music, right? It works, right? To an extent. Just don't beat a dead horse. And unfortunately, The Bodyguard not only beats a dead horse, it drills it, too. The story line is quite engrossing, however, its as if we have to make believe that this has never happened before. A man falling in love with the women he's suppose to be protecting. Didn't they do this in 1987? I believe the film was called Someone To Watch Over Me. Yes. Mimi Rogers, and directed by Ridley Scott. Maybe I have been alive too long. I shouldn't remember these things. So just pretend, and maybe you won't see that things are just a little too predictable in this romance thriller. We pose another threat here. Keven Kostner can act. Houston can sing. She CAN'T act! So, you cast her as one of the lead roles? This cannot be good. However, much to my surprise, its actually quite good. Whitney Houston can easily be dismissed. She does her best, but she comes off too over the top, and way too dramatic. 'SOMEBODY WAS IN MY HOUSE!?' The was she freaks out, it's believable, but she just didn't know when to pull back a little. Instead of working with her, our director here decides to let it slide, and let all that ability slip through the cracks. Hmm. Maybe we won't notice. Judging from the rating, it seems some of us did. Not to mention, maybe its just safe to assume that many people do not like Whitney Houston except as a musician. So she stars as an actress who is getting death threats from an unexpected source. A bodyguard is hired, but its not the one she wanted. This bodyguard is the best of the best, and he won't work for less then 3 grand a week. His name is Frank Farmer. ( Doesn't sound like a very dangerous man to me, but play along.) So! Needless to say things get heated along with the way, both inside and outside their relationship. I thought it was funny that they mentioned that she had an 8 year old son, but he's barely in the movie. In fact, I don't remember seeing him at all in the film. Anyway, The Bodyguard has a lot of unnecesary shots and footage that could have easily been discarded, but its clear they were just trying to beef up the running time on The Bodyguard. I don't know why. Who cares how long your film is, as long as its good. With that said, I do recommend The Bodyguard, however, its going with a warning: The same old formula is used that you've probably seen before. If not, many times. Expect good. Not great.",6,1,1,18 March 2019
Knocked Up," satisfying comedy
","I thought this was going to be trashy, but for the most part, I was very surprised and like Knocked Up very much. The focus here is on a party all nighter, who gets his girlfriend pregnant intentionally, and at a very high cost....now he's going to be a daddy, since she wants to keep the baby! Now, he's pretty much got nine months to discard his immature ways, before he becomes a father figure for life. Knocked Up handles everything very well, considering this is a Judd Apatow comedy, and it knows how to be a sexy comedy without being too raunchy. Hell, most of the time, I thought it was more serious then a comedy. The underlining message is serious, the movie is hilarious, don't misunderstand me. Altogether, this is a wonderful mix of fun, laughter, sex talk, and eventually, a beautiful baby daughter! 8 out of 10 stars....I'm rewarding this with an extra star for the parental love the film manages to capture, but didn't have to.",8,0,0,22 June 2020
The Doors," come on baby...let my fire!
","I really thought this movie was dumb, and I don't know why Oliver Stone wanted his name attached to this atrocity of a film. What we have here, is over 2 hours of a biography of a rock star that didn't even live to see his 30th birthday. It's about Jim Morrison, the lead singer of The Doors. He sang a lot of good songs, a lot of good music hits home here. Val Kilmer nails it as the lead singer. Aside from that, hey, I'm all done praising here! The film didn't need to be made, first of all. You want to watch a movie about a guy who gets nude girls dancing up on stage with him, and you want to watch a movie about a guy who exposes himself, and you want to watch a movie where he gets sprayed in the face by the police ( best scene in the movie, IMHO) then have at it. I say there's nothing to see here, although I thought Val Kilmer was better acting as Jim then he was playing Batman. My vote. 6 out of 10 stars. It boasts some great music and great talent from Kilmer, thats all there is to see here. I think the entire film is overrated. By the way, I was just joking about the best scene. The best scene is the bathtub scene. Goodbye!",6,0,2,30 March 2020
Malcolm X," the beginning of the rise of hatred towards a human race
","Malcolm X had great leadership skills. He was a great spokesmen. He had the mindset to be a great leader. Alas, the same could be said for Hitler. Both men took their strengths and talents, and used them for the wrong doing....beginning the rise of hatred towards a human race. The film depicts Malcolm X, who was taught ( brainwashed) into the thinking that he had to use everything that was ever taught by white men, and use those words against them. The film had a glimmer of hope, but was lost in translation at the direction Spike Lee chose to take it. It's sad. Truth be told, I really do like Spike Lee, I think he was born to be a filmmaker. Do The Right Thing was a very inspirational and very influential film for me in the late 80's, I got a lot of insight from prejudicial and racial tensions from watching that movie, and remains my favorite ( and only) Spike Lee film to date. Malcolm X just wants all blacks to hate whites for everything that we've supposedly done, which was all done wrong. It's our fault they are here. It's our fault they've been treated so badly. Malcolm X is a powerful, and very stressful film of its decade. But it takes about 17 to 20 minutes of material, and stretches it into an unbelievably unnecessary length of over three hours. Facts, facilities, and mindless quotes are stuffed down our throats. Black men cheer. White men hang their heads in shame. The fact is, all white men are not all bad, just like all black men are not all bad. The entire movie is just a parade of propaganda, boasting high levels of energy that can be felt and ripple down the spines of the affected. Spike Lee knows how to do his job. He's just using it for the wrong reasons. And I can't respect that. I won't ever show appreciation for it. We cannot hate the hater, we cannot hate, in general, we can only love and find inner peace, or thereby, we become unhappy, angry little piglets running around on the farm. Do we rise to power? Being a motivational speaker has great rewards, but with that comes responsibility. Teaching that its okay to hate the white men for wrong doings to all the black men, women, and children is a stereotype, we shouldn't be held responsible for captivity that happened before any of us were put on the map. It just isn't fair. Malcolm X is not a film for everyone, it's a film that depicts Malcolm X as a character, through the directors eyes. I want to know about the REAL Malcolm X. Was he really this wrathful? This hateful? The Nation of Islam is known to be associated with violence and terrorism acts. How can this Nation teach us anything but to hate? With that said, what I've seen, what I've gotten out of it, this is three and a half hour movie that teaches black people its okay to hate white people. Period. It's simple as that. And how can I have any love, respect, appreciation, like, or even any emotional attachment to such film? How can I relate? How can I cope? I can't! That's why I'm giving this 1 star!",1,4,12,30 November 2019
Elf," Will Ferrell shines as ELF!!!
","Raised as an elf, Buddy goes to New York City to locate his real father, who happens to be a hotshot boss for a corporation. It's not shocking to find out his dad is on the naughty list? What for, you ask? Inconsiderate, just like most bosses. With a Christmas theme, and tons and tons of laughs, Elf is sure to swing your moods into high spirits, and make you happy on the inside and out. Will Ferrell as an elf, taking the lead role, I'm not really sure how he pulled it off, but it works brilliantly here. Elf is by far my favorite Will movie. It brings on family fun, and keeps the profanity on the back burner ( except for a few innuendos that should fly over little ones heads, so no worries there) What are you waiting for? Grab your elf suit, get your elf shoes on along with the hat, and enjoy a dose of ELF tonight!",7,2,2,17 December 2019
Over the Top," tough guys don't dance....they arm wrestle
","Story is pretty stagnant here. It's just about a truck driver who finally gets in touch with his son, who is in the military academy, and his son is oblivious to the thought that he even has a father. To win his heart, he must compete with the toughest of the toughest in a world tournament arm wrestling match. Jesus, and you thought it was easy being an 80's dad, didn't you?? This movie isn't called over the top for nothing, as the main event itself is indeed OVER THE TOP with nonsense. A delight, but nonetheless nonsense. It was like watching wet paint dry, but less entertaining. In truth, this was a fun and early look at Stallones bogus roles, but watching all these arrogant tough guys talking all tough was just a bit too much for me. It was like an alpha male party. You want it? You got it! By far, the best arm wrestling movie I've ever seen in my life, Over the Top will work your afternoon muscles for you.",6,0,0,17 May 2020
Forrest Gump," You don't have to be smart to be epic!
","Forrest Gump is a wonderfully comprised film that follows the life of Forrest Gump through a series of events that are often comical, influential, and powerfully emotional. Forrest Gump only has an IQ of 75. Ask him if he's stupid. He's going to respond 'Stupid is as stupid does.' His wit and wisdom here will never leave you, the film just boasts famous quotes after quotes. My favorite quote out of the entire film, is when he tells Jenny 'I'm not a smart man. But I know what love is.' Forrest Gump, simply put, is a walking miracle, which is amazing, because were talking about someone who once had braces on his legs. And he never goes anywhere without being noticed or heard. If you're sitting next to him waiting for the bus on the bench, he'll have no problem opening up a conversation with you, as he always seems very friendly and polite. That's not to say he's not in touch with his mean side. His protective anger flares up at least once, when he becomes very protective with Jenny in a situation she should have never been in. As he puts it, him and Jenny are like 'two peas in a pod', although they seem to wander their own directions, but Gump likes to keep her under his wing. Eventually, they get married, and have a child. Forrest Gump chronicles the legend of over a 30 year period for a person who has been proud to serve his country, have a family, shakes hands with the President of The United States, and make miracles and dreams come true. A film that reminds us all that you don't have to be smart to be this epic, either.",8,0,0,18 May 2020
Gone Baby Gone," Shockingly excellent film
","Ben Affleck has never impressed me as an actor. He helms the film here as director and writer. The results? Gone Baby Gone is nothing short of a grand slam. I've only watched 2 films in my entire life with, what I would call, a justifiable kidnapping. Weather or not they find this little girl alive, if at all, is going to be up to you to find out, you're going to have to watch, and trust me, it will be worth your time. It's going to have one of those endings that's going to be debatable between two viewers who are going to agree or disagree. Sometimes, people do the wrong things for the right reasons. In general, kidnapping is wrong. The film is carefully handled, has a smooth pace, great dialogue, and a controversial but satisfying ending. If you have any information regarding a child who may have been stolen, please contact Missing & Exploited Children at 1-800-THE-LOST. Great job, Affleck!",9,1,1,14 March 2020
Footloose," electrifying, 80's gem.
","Packed with great music and abundance of energy, Footloose is here to kick off your Sunday shoes! After a tragic accident left a small, religious town mourning, dancing is off limits here. Too bad Ren didn't know. Too bad Ren doesn't care. He's new in town, but refuses to be the one to get pushed over. Going toe to toe with the town preacher is going to be a task all on its own, who helped pass the ordinance years ago, but hows everything going to fall into place when he falls for his young teenage daughter? Highly stylized for its time, and filled with plenty of catchy tunes, Footloose is going to make you want to turn your own living room into a dance floor. Kevin Bacon alone reigns supreme with his spunk, and it can't be denied he had some natural knack for this role as the new kid who is brave enough to turn some of the bible verses against the preacher ( played flawlessly by John Lithgow, surprisingly a great actor for this particular role.) If you're not ready to be energized, stay away from here, because Footloose will leave you losing your blues!",6,0,0,22 April 2020
Cast Away," Outstanding!
","Isolation. Survival. Loneliness. This is Cast Away, the story about one man and his quest to survive on his own after being stranded in the waters after a plane crash that left everyone for dead except for him. He lives for years on an island, finds his way to live, eat, and survive in ways that we never would have dreamed possible. He befriends a volleyball named Wilson...it's the actual name of the ball. We become so emotionally attached to this character ( played by Tom Hanks), that we feel his every emotion. We feel his pain. We sense his isolation. We see his loneliness. And more then anything, he just wants to get home to his wife. The ending surprised me, and the final scene is extremely haunting, but altogether, I found this movie no less then perfect in every aspect, and Hanks does a great job handling the sensitivity of such character. I knew he had it in him! This can be a difficult and disturbing movie for some, but for the most part, I think this is a very important movie for its time and now. It is an absolute must see!",8,0,1,16 January 2020
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," Get a lighter, get some gasoline, and BURN THIS MOVIE!!!!
","Terminator 3: Rise of the Stupid Movies. Sorry. I'll behave. Terminator 3 disconnects itself from the path of Terminator and Terminator 2, and goes its own route. This time, its a female terminator. She's much more advanced then the T-1000. She can inflate her chest to any size she wants! CAN T-1000 DO THAT!??? All joking aside, this is a fair but unacceptable shake at the Terminator films, and certainly not the worst one. Dialogue is pretty flat on this one. No quotable lines, nope, not one. Arnold is much less energetic, don't think I didn't notice, and no, don't come up with excuses 'Well, he's old.' It's not an excuse. Maybe they should have made the movie a little closer to T2, now where's your next excuse? The ending seemed generic, almost anti climatic. It doesn't even feel like a Terminator movie to me. And the violence has even been toned down, don't think I didn't notice. Verdict is in. JUDGEMENT DAY! My judgement? Get out of here, Terminator 3. At least its better then Terminator Salvation, I haven't gotten around to watching that one yet. Was the movie so bad that Arnold didn't even show up in it? What about Dark Fate? It couldn't have been THAT bad!!!",6,1,7,26 January 2020
Heartbreak Ridge," He'll break you before you can break his heart!
","What do you do with a platoon with a bad attitude? Simple: Give them a squad leader with an even badder one! Meet Gunnery Tom Highway, a man with a long history of great work, but that great work comes with a high price with this guy, he doesn't let ANYONE bully or steam roll over him. When he's on the brink of retiring, but seems to have a strong love for what he does, and a strong hatred for the filth that gets in his way, his tough talking discipline skills are going to be put to the test with a 'problem child' platoon that thinks they can just do whatever they want. They've already chased off at least one sergeant, so let's see if they can chase Tom Highway off. Or rather, let's watch Gunnery Tom Highway whip these boys into shape. If you run your mouth off to this sergeant, pray he's in a good mood, and he'll just pull you up off your feet by your nose! While Heartbreak Ridge may come off as a bitter, angry film, its really not. It's just fighting fire with fire, and deep inside, Gunnery Tom Highway does a have a heart...watch closely, you'll catch a glimpse of it. He just doesn't like taking crap from anybody, its one of his weaknesses. He doesn't care who you are, a private, First Class Sergeant, he doesn't care....he's got no problem putting you in your place. It's a movie that shows us, no matter how tough you think you are, when you're in the military, when they say move, you MOVE, no questions asked. It's life or death, and Tom Highway has lived to tell his stories, so he obviously knows what he's doing. Great 'war before the war' movie, make Heartbreak Ridge your afternoon pick today!",7,0,0,23 May 2020
Rocky IV," Rocky! Rocky! Rocky! Rocky!
","Rocky IV starts off exactly where Rocky III ended. An ultimate challenger has risen to fame, and this time, Rocky just may have met his match. A Russian boxer, with a brutally powerful 4000 pound psi, has made headlines, looking for his next match. Apollo Creed is interested in facing the challenge after hearing all the hype on TV, and fearlessly faces the deadly Ivan Drago. Things do not turn out well for Apollo. He not only loses, he endures a fatal blow to the head, and Rocky ends up losing the man he befriended, even after stepping in the ring with him himself. Now, if you remember the end of Rocky II, the main event with Rocky and Apollo, you remember how these two were a force to be reckoned with, and the battle in the ring was a close match for both of them. If Ivan Drago can take out Apollo with one punch, what does this mean for Rocky, who is already slowly showing signs of slow down, in mental and physical health. Rocky doesn't care. He wants the ultimate challenge against Ivan Drago, choosing to do a match with no royalties, on Christmas Day, in Russia, Ivans own country. Doing a match, for free, a boxing match risking your own life, to repay Apollo with the ultimate Christmas gift, in Dragos own country? Wow! Rocky means BUSINESS here! To take on the incredibly powerful Ivan Drago is going to mean Rocky is going to have to go through some pretty painful training, as he doesn't stand a chance of possessing a 4000 pound psi such as Ivan Drago himself. He's going to have to rebuild himself, from head to toe, before he can step head to toe with Drago in the ring. Rocky IV may or may not be the best in the series, it can be argued, but what cannot be argued, is that this film was by far the most exciting. Through the clever montages, it manages to pump up your own blood, and root more then ever for Rocky. There are a number of reasons why Rocky wants to take down the mighty Drago, all of which Adrian won't be able to understand, feeling as if he's committing suicide just by getting in the ring with him, and declaring to Rocky that he can't win. Rocky is going to do everything he can to prove her and the rest of the world wrong. Rocky 4 gets 7 out of 10 stars!",7,0,0,22 May 2020
The 40-Year-Old Virgin," He got LUCKY!!!
","The 40 Year Old Virgin is about an aging, middle aged man who one day, while playing a poker game with his buddies, starts to get grilled with a bunch of questions about the first girl he had ever been with. The boys want all the gory details, they want graphic descriptions to embed in their heads ( boys will be boys!) When he slips up and describes her chest as feeling like 'sandbags', the boys start to get suspicious that he's never been with a woman in his life. And they're right, Andy is a 40 year old virgin. Most men, feeling as if their talk about how many women that they've been with, feeling as if its some high score or something, Andy seems to be saving himself for something better....he wants love, not sex. And he's been pretty patient about it. Andy is such a great, nice guy, and has morals. There's nothing wrong with that, the film actually defends guys with this sort of mentality. As far as the 40 year old virgin, he got LUCKY!!! He finds love and romance with the first woman he dates, and its all lighthearted humor from here. We watch as he survives hilarious mishaps, too nice of a guy and shy to mention anything about a nip slip, we root and cheer for the guy who has a positive attitude, and doesn't have to go through a bunch of bad apples to find the good one. I thought the film was handled very well, probably could have done without the racial jokes, but I can give it a pass, this is a great comedy to add to your collection. ( Yes, I think its worth owning.)",7,0,0,26 May 2020
Collateral," entertaining, but nothing more then that
","Tom Cruise as a hit man. He gets transported around by a cab driver. He throws a man from a multi story window. A few twists and turns. I'm joking, of course. Aside from a night of 'let's go from this place to that place, so I can kill this guy and then the next guy', I really don't see how this is earning a 7.5 rating. IT WASN'T THAT GOOD! It's entertainment to the max, and that's about it. Nothing plausible here, either. And, by that, I think maybe this movie should have been called Mission Impossible. Oh, and do I dare add that it's about fifteen minutes too long! And the ending? ( Rolling eyes) You'll have to do better next time with your non believers of this film, which I happen to be one. Not that I expect or anticipate a reboot. Just in case they do! A little more...believable. ( IMHO, Foxx performance outshines Cruise. Yeah! I said it!)",7,1,2,8 April 2019
Flashdance," I don't want to be too hard on Flashdance, but...
","I almost gave it 5 out of 10. However, I don't want to be hard on Flashdance. It's not a perfect movie by any means, I can't even say that it's a good movie. However, at its core, it has heart, soul, and passion. It also has the drive to send its message clear, stay close to your dreams, but try to make it a reality. Do what you love to do, and you will never have to work a day in your life. I felt the movie depended way too strongly on the dancing and the music, which left what remained of the film hollow and weak. And Jennifer Beals just wasn't a strong enough actress to pull this off. Can't overlook it. Sorry. All in all, I think Flashdance served its purpose for its time, it made a lot of money, and love it or hate it, but you can't knock it...it's an iconic film of 1983.",6,1,1,16 April 2018
Dirty Dancing," I've been meaning to getting around to reviewing this movie
","If the movie doesn't grab you, the music certainly will. I was going to go into the story line, but why waste time with that, imdb spoiled that for you! It's a dance/romance film, iconic for the 80's, and by todays standards, its a decent retro look at how you can elevate a girl by holding her in the air like a trophy. I wouldn't really call that dancing. I think the story was silly, however, like most musicals ( and you can argue with me all you want, Dirty Dancing IS a musical) the film relies heavy on the soundtrack, and not the story. If you want to see a great movie with great music and great acting, find another musical to watch. If you want to see a great movie with great music and fun elements, Dirty Dancing is your cure to the fever.",7,0,0,20 August 2019
The Butterfly Effect," Powerful film with disturbing themes, The Butterfly Effect will ripple your wings!
","This movie was an emotional shock fest. It delivers a brisk pacing in quickly unveiling a story that will haunt and challenge the way you feel about the life you have lived, and the choices you have made. Let me ask you two questions, and be very honest with your answer, because no one will know: Have you ever been hurt as a child? Have you ever hurt a child? Now let me ask you one last thing, if there was a way to change things, would you? Could you? How would you? The Butterfly Effect, simply put, is a supernatural phenomena of trying to go back to a time when something went wrong, and try to make it right again. Doing so, how would that change things? The question isn't how would it change things, the question is how would it alter other events. The film explores deep and troubling subject matter. I don't want to give away anything big, let's just say a couple of young children are put in a situation that no child should ever be in, and from here, we set a the concrete on the foundation that The Butterfly Effect will be built on. From here, we have a chain of painful events. Very bad things happen in this movie. Very bad things! We don't question why they happen, we just accept that they happened. The film pursues the possibility that you CAN go back and change things, as our hero does unusually just by reading his journal, which he uses to try to remember phases in his life blocked out by blackouts. What he doesn't realize, is that by going back and trying to do things for the better, it's really turning out for the worse. The movie silently begs the question: Is it really better to be dead then alive? What good is it saving something thats broken? From here, I developed a deep caring for all the characters. Not justifying what some of them have done, but understanding why they've done it. And it's all about how we handle ourselves once good or bad things have been done. For everything that we do, good or bad, there are either rewards or consequences. For example, a practical joke is pulled in the movie, but a family was severely impacted by this cruel prank. The film will continually knock you around with one emotional blow right after the other, but the last twenty minutes will leave you feeling as if you've been uppercut under the jaw. Very powerful, very moving, very difficult film to watch, but I think this is one that has to be viewed more then once if you really want to get it. I think the first time you watch it, you just feel it.",8,0,0,18 November 2018
District 9," ridiculous
","Everyone just ranted and raved over what a great movie this was! What I saw, from my perspective, is a film just under two hours, that could have easily have been wrapped up in 1 hour tops. An hour movie! That's all this needed to be. Who's going to go to the theater and watch an hour long movie back in 2009? So let's just add an hour of filler, thirty minutes of commentary in the beginning, and we'll stretch out the other half hour into long drawn out action sequences towards the end. I am just in utter shock that people don't want to say how they really feel. This is not a 10 star movie like some reviewers want you to think. It's not even a 9 or 8 star movie. If you really wanted my opinion, its barely even a movie from my way of looking at things. It sure doesn't behave like one. A movie has likable characters, at least a few here and there. The story is so paper thin, that if I told you what it was about, I would pretty much be telling you the whole damned movie. A spaceship gets stranded over South Africa, and the aliens that were in it are now on earth. Quarantined off in a section called District 9, they are free to live and have the same human rights as us. Even though they aren't human. Fast forward an approximate 20 years. Times have changed, and now the aliens are no longer welcome, and the military wants to take District 9 back. These aliens are actually pretty peaceful. That is, until you piss them off, and then they are quite ruthless. One of the guys can actually speak and understand the alien language, you know, because there's nothing you can't pull past an audience these days. If they're stupid enough to give this a 10 star review, then they'll be dumb enough to believe a man can speak the extraterrestrial tongue. In the meantime, his hand is developing like an aliens, because if he can speak the language, he may as well be just like them right? He's told it can take up to three years to develop a human hand back. Too bad a story cant be developed here. The action doesn't really start picking up until the last half hour, and by that time, its too late to reprise my respect or like for you POS film. District 9 is a bust, and I think people just don't want to admit it, so they praise it. That's all here. If you like science fiction movies, the best ones were made in the 50's. I can't recommend District 9.",3,0,3,27 March 2020
JFK," a very important film from the 90's, brought to us by Oliver Stone
","You won't have a very good time watching this, trust me. It's upsetting, it's disturbing, but there it is if you're interested. The facts are there. Everything that they know is laid out on the table for you to see. I found very little fabricated. Nobody will truly know why it happened that day, but everyone will know what happened that day. And I cannot think of a more important film from the 90's, then JFK.",8,1,3,26 December 2018
The Number 23," The Number 23 is a does a number on your attention
","I couldn't stop watching! I mean, my attention was kept from beginning to end. Does this mean it was a great movie? In a word, no. The Number 23 suffers from some major problems, which I feel we need to get out of the way right away. 23 problems? Oh, I'm sure I can find them, however, I don't think this website is going to allow such a lengthy review, so I'm going to narrow it down to 5 major problems. PROBLEM # 1: They STUFF useless facts about the number 23 down your throat! Famous and infamous people died on this day, The Titanic sunk on the month of such and such, on the day of the 23rd, ya ya ya, you get the point. It gets downright annoying. Okay, we get it, you're trying to establish that 23 is a freaky number, we got it! For the purposes of the movie we will believe it. Only a logical person would know the truth about the number 23 anyways. ( And that is, it's just a number!) PROBLEM #2: Story suffers from plot holes. PROBLEM # 3: Unanswered questions by the end of the film. PROBLEM #4: Impossible scenes that take place on film, but lack logic on how they were done. For example, a buried skeleton is supposedly moved, yet it is not explained how it was moved without a damn shovel. How? It was done off screen, I want to know! PROBLEM #5: Too much mystery, and not enough suspense. The movie plays too much on trying to be a mystery, and as the story unveils, more and more of the mystery is solved, but the REAL mystery remains unsolved. And that REAL mystery: What's the real deal behind the number 23? What's it's origin? Why is it a number that attracts such darkness. Okay, we are going to talk about a sixth problem here, and that is we not only fear the number 23, but multiples of 23. The word PINK, for example, corresponding to the letters to numbers of the alphabet, adds up to 46, and 46 dived by 2 is....drum roll, please...23! Well, 2 plus 3 is 5, far from 23! And 2 take away 3 is -1. See, I'm good with numbers, too. Is this a scary movie? I wouldn't say so much scary, as downright disturbing. The entire movie I'm rating at 6 stars, however, Jim Careys strong performance as the lead earns it another star. Nice work, Carey. Story goes like this: a book is given to Sparrow for his birthday. It turns out the book is about the number 23, and yet it only has 22 chapters. As he reads the book, he becomes obsessed with not only the events in the book, but also with the number 23 itself. He believes the book is about him. Too many coincidences. A few twists and turns, and this movie becomes a mind boggling, 'numbing' roller coaster of a ride. If the movie doesn't follow you the rest of your life, trust me, the final scene will!",7,0,2,2 November 2018
Shrek the Third," First tug at the udders of the Shrek cash cow
","I wish they would have just left it alone with the second film. No. They just had to give a tug at the cash cow. Oh well. With that said, Shrek the Third was an okay movie, but a needless sequel to the franchise nevertheless. I didn't find it as funny as the first or second movie, however, it plays out and feels like as Shrek movie, so kudos for that. We reunite Princess Fiona, along with the irritating but lovable donkey, in an all new adventure. This time, its family issues, and a rebellious fight that develops in Far, Far Away Land so be prepared for that. All in all, Shrek the Third didn't amaze me, but it didn't disappoint me either. I just wish they would have left the movie alone.",6,0,0,14 January 2020
Back to the Future Part III," Finally finished it! It only took me 30 years!
","Back to the Future Part III concludes the trilogy. This time, Marty has his hands full. He must not only go back to the year 1955 to warn Doc that he's been transported to the year 1885, but he must also prevent his death from a vicious cowboy nicknamed Mad Dog! There's more. Marty needs to get back to his home year 1985, but a little problem with the Doloreon is causing a bit of a problem. And they can't get parts for the car when they're in the year 1885, because the company that makes the spare parts won't be around for another 60 years. Problems, problems. To make matters worse, Emmet Brown has fallen in love with a lovely women named Clara? Why is that a problem. It's not for him, but for Marty....can he keep his eyes off the gal long enough to remember to help Marty get back to his own year? I have to admit, I didn't like Back to the Future Part III very much back when it came out. I couldn't accept the fact it was a western. Even if I could, I kept trying to catch this movie time after time again on cable, DirectTV, etc....and I could never catch it from beginning to end. Well. 30 year anniversary of the film, and being homebound, I decided to rent it. I was not in regret. It has some problems, but for the most part, I can accept this film a lot better now then I did back then. It doesn't rely too heavy on the western part, that story line is wrapped up in the first hour and half. From there, it's all about getting Marty home. I trust that Zemeckisis ended this trilogy the best way he knew how to, and although it's got its fair shake on mixed reviews, I thought it was a great (but not perfect) film that ends everything pretty satisfying.",7,1,2,28 March 2020
Coco," congratulations, Pixar!
","And I mean that from the bottom of my heart. It took, I don't know how many Pixar movies that were released, and you guys knocked it out of the park, one right after the other. Great, great movies, movies that inspired, were emotionally charged, were great for children and adults of all ages. Toy Story, Cars, etc, your movies were the best. You only accepted the cream of the crop. And when I saw the trailers for Coco, I didn't waste any time, even before I went to see it at the theater, I automatically rated it 10 stars, because I knew it was automatically going to be great. After what I saw? Congratulations, Pixar, you created the very first Pixar movie I do not like. Let me explain. I've been around long enough on this planet to know, some films deserve hype, and some films don't deserve hype, but get hype. That's Coco, ladies and germs! It wasn't bad, but there's no way in any corner of this universe that you can convince me this is a 10 star winner. Please disregard those reviews, it just doesn't math up to what Pixar used to be, and this movie confirms for me the beginning of the bloodbath for Pixar altogether. ( Anything left for you to ruin now, Disney? My dinner is on the stove!) Generations after a musical legend has passed away during his concert, and he dies when....a bell falls on his head, crushing him. Yes, that's part of the movie. Generations later, and the musical love for his family has switched over to...making shoes. Instead of making money, let's make shoes. Makes sense. Let's watch further. We learn that the young lad, Miguel, is related to this sensation, and Miguel has a deep love for music, but every time he tries to pick up a guitar, he is shunned upon, mainly by his senile granny. When his guitar is broken purposely, he finds out at the same time that a concert is playing, and that he should audition. He would love to, but he doesn't have a guitar, so he sneaks off to the museum where the real legendary guitar is kept, and attempts to steal it for the audition. With no explanation on how it happens, he is transported to the land of the dead, where the movie itself falls dead in its tracks. I'm sorry, but I thought this was going to be a musical, and 45 minutes in, I only heard one song, 'Remember Me', ironically sang by the victim of the bell. ( Bell not secure, the guitar not secure to the wall, do you guys secure anything in this movie?) The humor I was expecting fell flat, falling victim to recycled slapstick humor I used to laugh at in the 80's. The last half of the movie was dull, weak and boring, and too predictable. I was expecting a lot from Pixar, because of the reputation they have had. Land Of The Dead? Make sure Pixar is added to that graveyard, Disney.",7,0,1,31 May 2018

Dumb and dumber ( Jim Carey and Jeff Daniels) go on a cross country trip to return the suitcase, because one fell in love, and the other is just going for the ride.

Caddyshack," Cup runneth over with laughs
","It should be illegal to make movies this funny. Packed and overflowing at the seams with jokes, quotes, and laughs, Caddyshack doesn't really have any room for a story. People slam Caddyshack II for having virtually no story line, but to be very truthful, neither does this one. The difference is, this movie sets the bar very high for what it is: an over the top, goofy comedy. When you take all the humor out of the movie, all your left with is the husk of a strange, weird film. The movie strategies itself into a jam packed laugh fest. If you go three minutes without laughing, something is wrong. Rodney Dangerfield alone, all he has to do is open his mouth, and I'm already laughing. 'If I kill all the golfers on the golf course, wouldn't that be illegal?' 'Gophers, you idiot! Not golfers!' I'm cracking myself up here. There's the famous pool scene with the Baby Ruth floating around. Caddyshack is your pick! It will not ruin your evening, trust me.",7,1,1,2 December 2019

Logan is a great film, wonderfully written as a final farewell to this beloved Marvel character. I have not heard one complaint yet about the opening scene, and it makes up for the ending. The ending is not bad, I was satisfied with they ended this movie, but I won't spoil that for you. In fact, I can't really spoil anything in this film for you. All I can say, is that this movie was something else. Also, have a box of Kleenex handy, Logan is a sad movie.",9,2,5,2 May 2019
Midsommar," clever, unique horror film
","This movie was amazing. It's an emotionally surcharaged, disturbing, and yet visually striking film. I've never quite seen a horror movie as such. First and foremost, maybe its important that the viewer gets a heads up on what they will be expecting, without giving any major surprises away. I will let you know, this is INDEED a horror movie, but you're not going to get anything violent right off the bat, so if patience isn't one of your traits, Midsommar may be trouble for you. The film patiently builds itself and its characters, uniting them as one, and with clever camera work and cinematography, we are woven into the lives of such characters and we are emotionally attached to these characters. The film is strategic in all its design. Every scene, every sound, and everything you see. The director knew what he was writing and directing, and he does such a damn good job at it. On the negative side, not everyone will appreciate Midsommar for what it is. What it is, is a surreal, very moving film that captures mystery with, how do I say, an uncomfortable feeling. If at any point, especially in the beginning of the film, if you every get uneasy or that unpleasant feeling....that's wonderful! That's EXACTLY what the film is intended to do. Does it seem to bombard the viewer with visual? That's debatable. While there were times I felt this attribute was abused, on the same token, it cannot be denied that it works for what its intended to do. The film doesn't want to keep you up tonight with nightmares, it just demands to be remembered, and if you're in the right mood, and you can appreciate it for what it is, you will remember. Again. Not a movie for everyone. It's the wrong movie to watch if you're already feeling sad. Although the films latter moments has many, many lighthearted scenes in the sun, filling it with a sense of joy and happiness, it's important to understand that Midsommar is a movie that is not here to cause you to want to hug your neighbor and bake them cookies after your done watching. This is a surreal life horror movie. That's what it is, and from what I've seen, everything here was done correctly, and passes with flying colors. Most of the bad reviews on this film, from what I've seen, is just because they don't understand, or they don't want to understand. Story goes as follows: A tragic suicide rattles a small family, and they decide to make a special vacation trip overseas to 'keep them together.' The aftermath is unpredictable and unspeakable acts and acts of violence. I've said too much. The film must be seen to be believed. And just try to understand, the film stands in its own catagory. It is unique. I praise A24 films for being a very successful movie industry that doesn't believe that its audience has to settle for less then perfection. Job well done, team!",8,6,8,5 December 2019
Saw," Damn good movie!
","This is it. The only movie I know to date that correctly laces mystery, drama, and horror, and leaves you with an ending that will leave your jaw dropping to the floor. Saw is incredibly great, patiently paced, and well made film. The movie opens up with two strangers, bound by chain, in a room. Get used to this room, they're going to be here awhile. The one who put them there has given them a puzzle to figure out. There's a way out of the room, they just need to put their heads together and figure it out. Along the way, some major tension, major disagreements, and major meltdowns. Saw is anything but uplifting. I'll say this, you are going to stay glued to your seat throughout the entire movie, I guarantee it. You're not even going to want to get up to go potty, trust me, so anything you need to get, snacks, calls out of the way, because NOTHING is going to tear your attention away from Saw. Got that?

He checks out a motel room, runs up a big bill, and goes on the same sabotage he did in the original Home Alone, making this an unoriginal sequel. I mean, I'm just going to say it: I think John Hughes got real lazy in the 90's, and this was living proof. He's better then this! It feels like the entire movie is just a carbon copy of the first one, so what's the point? Oh, there's one other thing different....the bumbling bandits are now trying to rob a toy store for Christmas. They didn't do that in the original. Does that make this movie worthy? ( Shrugs) It was just an excuse to make another Home Alone. They wanted to make another one quick before Culkin grew older. Which he did. It's why he wasn't in Home Alone 3. I can't even call this a fair sequel, because it's not fair ripping off your own movie. That should be criminal charges, but hey, were talking Hollywood here.

","Seth Brundle is an extremely smart scientist working on a project...teleportation, but it needs a lot of work before he can bring his idea to the public eye. A journalist ( Davis) is excited to bring the story public, but Seth is against the idea, because he hasn't worked out the kinks yet. Plus, he doesn't want his idea exposed just yet. As they bond and fall for each other, Seth works continuously on the project, overcoming hurdles and errors along the way, trying to teleport a live animal, etc. When his teleportation project finally becomes successful, he's ready to take the next big plunge....teleportation of a human being. And he's using himself as guinea pig. Too bad he does something stupid....he forgets to cover the area where small objects can be teleported, and a fly lands on the screen while he's in the pod. The computer program gets confused weather to transport the fly or him over, so by default, it fuses the two together. Hey! Can't blame the computer, it doesn't know what you do and don't want to do, it's just running a program, you run the show! So! He doesn't know he's a fly just yet, his body goes through a small and painful metamorphosis, and he's slowly transforming himself into an insect, defying all laws of human nature. Director David Cronenberg does NOT shy away from the violence here, oh no. This movie was quite gruesome, especially with the gurgitation scenes. The Fly is, bar none, a great science fiction film, and very creative at that. Good movie, but I would avoid the sequel at all costs. ( Trust me. Avoid it at all costs!)",8,1,1,1 February 2020
Groundhog Day," good movie, but a little over rated
","I thought this was a good movie, just a little over rated for its title. Currently at 8 stars? Spare me. It was good at its time, but apparently people can over look its flaws, and move past that. That's a good thing. My main complaint with Groundhog Day? Too predictable. We all know he's going to get the girl at the end, so why drag it out. Groundhog Day just becomes a repetitive parade of nonsense events, the same thing happening every day, the only thing different happening is Murrays character, under the realization that he's living the same day over and over. So it doesn't matter what he does, he's going to wake up, and live February 2 all over again. It's funny at first, but then quickly becomes tiresome, and of course, they can't base the entire film about this, so we'll add the 'boy likes girl, girl gets boy' formula, and everybody will be okay with this. Well. It worked. Groundhog Day is a fun, great, family afternoon film from 1993, and Bill Murray and Andie McDowell steal 90 percent of the show. Sometimes, just sometimes, I think that's a bad thing. I think they hogged all the action. If you haven't seen this, I recommend it.",6,0,2,2 March 2019
Pretty Woman," It must have been love. But its over now.
","Edward Lewis seems to have it all. He's part of a rich but very troubled corporation, and his troubles keep on mounting, mainly internally then externally. He's not in any relationship, in fact, he doesn't want any relationship. Perhaps this is why hes chosen a prostitute as his escort for the week, someone who will work hard for him, and yet no one to answer to once the work is completed. Seems fair enough, as Edward has his hands and plates full with much other, complicated issues. Meet Vivian Ward! She's the prostitute hired to be his escort, and she earns her living off the streets, so she's not at all prepared for the champagne budget that she's about to be exposed to when she meets Edward. Nevertheless, she agrees to be his escort, with no talk and no concern of any foul play on the side. It doesn't take long before these two bond. Question is, will she make or break his company when they're both talk of the town. And what will become of them? Pretty Woman was, and still is, a stylish look at the final breath of air taken from the 80's. Yes, its a 1990 film, but trust me, the bulk, if not the entire film, was filmed in the 80's. It's beginning is a bit slow, almost even a bumpy road, but within the first 15 minutes, its on a smooth path, and its adorable themes are off the charts here. It's almost impossible not to smile, laugh, cry, or feel anything for these two, as they steal the show. I'm not much of a Richard Gere fan, and I'm not much of a Julia Roberts fan anymore either, but if you haven't seen Pretty Woman yet, you need to make time for this romance film tonight. The entire film pretty much gets its points across without violating much of anything, in fact, the content is so mild I wonder sometimes why it even got an R rating. Regardless, this is a fun, and very entertaining look at a romance between a rich guy and a broke, but hard working girl, and we watch their horizons get expanded, get crushed, and then finally, get resolved.",7,1,1,5 June 2020
The Godfather: Part III," Completely disconnected from the previous two films
","I was a bit puzzled within the first hour of The Godfather Part III. Never mind the fact that the first hour could have been wrapped up in ten minutes tops, but they stretch it out to a full hour....the party itself is the entire first half hour, for crying out loud! I was puzzled by the behavior of, what was once, familiar characters. I get the sense that Part III was more interested in wrapping the trilogy up, but didn't know how to continue it. So let's use the story line of selling out to the banks of Vatican? And I was puzzled by the questions that had no answers. Why is Kay back with him after, well, after Part II? And tying The Pope into this story? While the entire movie is a snooze fest, I have to hand it to them, they put together one lushly detailed picture here. It's just too bad nothing else works here. The entire film is a huge disappointment, and I stand by my theory, if you wait fifteen years to crank out another installment to your film, its not going to bode well with the rest of your installments. It just doesn't work like that. That said, The Godfather Part III takes forever to take off, and when it finally does take off, certain parts of the film drag out entirely too long, It's almost as if they were deliberately trying to make an hour and a half movie stretch to as close to a three hour running time, just to match the running time of the first two films. Yes, I'm saying they didn't have jack for material here, I think it's obvious they didn't. This final film to The Godfather was promised to be satisfying, but I myself was let down. Let's see how you think this stacks up to the two outstanding films from the 70's.",6,1,2,1 February 2020
Sausage Party," dumb movie, but worth a look
","While it may seem like a comedy, deep down, Sausage Party is a horror movie, seen through the eyes of various food items...all in computer animated beauty. Take away all the vulgar humor, foul language, and obscenities altogether, and Sausage Party is ( not surprisingly) a very dumb movie. The first ten minutes of this had me, I mean, really had me...I laughed a few times, and thought I was in for a winner. After the first ten minutes, it was already tiresome...the 'f' bomb dropped more times then I care to count. We get it, it's an R rated computer animated movie, not intended for children. Does it really find the need to abuse the offensive material? In the case of Sausage Party, it does. It just seems like an endless montage to say and do whatever possible to shock us, but after the first 20 minutes, you are actually immune to it, if you make it that far. The story actually makes you feel bad for consuming food, something essential for life, and the idea that food has real feelings and is alive is just pure silly, but for the films purposes, we play along, and therefore it turns out to be an entertaining piece to watch. If you don't think food that can talk and like to cuss is funny, you're in a lot of trouble with this movie. Most of the jokes are misses, but the ones that are hits, they are worth remembering. So when food finds out it is being purchased to be eaten, they decide to fight back. I thought the movie was quite violent, a human head is actually decapitated ( by accident) and after an hour of watching this, there are finally several 'oh my god!' moments...you may be caught a little off guard by the turn it takes, and trust me, you will know what I'm talking about...quite a bit of gore at the end. So all in all, this is a story about food vs people. Who will win? The question really is, who will care? And how many will laugh at it?",6,0,2,21 November 2016
Joker," Put on a happy face
","First and foremost, let me begin this review by giving thanks and praise for the team that helped put this together, not to mention the incredibly mind blowing performance from Phoenix himself. I can go out of my way and say that this film makes up for all the rest of the trash that has been released in theaters in 2019. I will say this. I was caught a bit off guard at how intense, and how violent the film was, and I was also caught off guard at how sad and depressing it was. But it was deep, and I'm perfectly content with it all. I was also caught a bit off guard at the direction the story went, however, I'm fine with that, because everything here works. The cinematography was great. The emotional depth is credible. And the feel of it all is jaw dropping. The feeling of isolation, abandonment, lonliness, and mental illness itself is the focus and approach for Joker, a movie that finally gives us some insight on how Joker became who he is. When you think of Gotham, you think of Batman, and his real name is Bruce Wayne. What's the Jokers real name? We just know him as Joker, and he's a bad guy, right? Meet Arthur Fleck. He seems on the surface an odd character, who bounces his knees a lot, can't seem to sit still or quiet, and has major outbursts of laughter. Inside, though, he's just like the rest of us. He has the same wants and needs, he just wants to work and get paid just like the rest of us, he just wants to live like the rest of us....but he's NOT just like the rest of us. For that, he's pretty much shunned upon by the bulk of Gotham. The only ones who seem to be okay with him is his mother, whom he lives with, and a woman he met on the elevator with a child, who believes the building is 'awful'. Meanwhile, Gotham is in sad shape, with its workers on strike, and trash and rats are piling up fast. On the brink of turmoil, and every avenue he pursues seems roadblocked, Arthur doesn't really have a lot going for him. Even his comedic acts are shunned upon, instead of getting people to laugh, he becomes a laughingstock, and is invited on a TV show, hosted by a talk show host he imagined as his friend. It seems, deep inside, Arthur just wants to be loved. Who wouldn't? What do you do when you feel like the whole world doesn't understand, or worse, doesn't care. This sets the concrete foundation of Joker, and from there, we bravely build a new story, bringing the spotlight to Joker himself, without the feeling of this film being a reboot or following any footsteps that have already been traveled. Where's the problem? I don't see one. It's unique, the film is deep, and more then anything, Phoenix steals the show as Arthur/Joker. It made me cry more then it made me laugh, and maybe that was the whole intent. A movie that begs you to understand your not alone in this fight in life. There's a Arthur/Joker inside all of us.",9,3,7,21 December 2019
Con Air," Action packed, from beginning to end. Welcome to Con Air!
","I just watched this again after 20 years, and wow, it's still almost as refreshing as the day it came out! Plenty of explosive action, so let the Cage out of his cage! This time, he just wants to get home to see his daughter, after being released from prison after doing his time. The plane, carrying all convicts, gets hijacked, and puts a serious dent in his plans. However, it's NOT going to stop him from seeing his kid. No bomb, threat, fight or fire is going to stop this man. The movie is strategic, combining a little bit of Die Hard with the formula. Pretty much, it's Die Hard on a plane. The action, well, it's a little silly looking back on it, but for the most part, I still think this is a great flick to watch. And it has plenty of laugh out loud humor to keep you smiling, and the action never ceases up, so it keeps your blood pumping. So strap yourself in tight, and enjoy the ride. Con Air is going to boldly go where no one has dared to go before! 8 out of 10!",8,1,1,21 August 2018
It Chapter Two," Nails. And fails.
","I don't think the standards are any higher for It Chapter Two then the 2017 film. Acting was great. That's about the only good thing I can say about what I saw. Too much reliance on CGI, which is obviously never coming to an end, however, growing up with many films that used much more creative effects, its something I will never adapt to. Stop referencing to movies like The Shining or The Thing, when films like that are at a higher standard then your reliance on CGI, do I make myself clear, filmmakers? Come up with your own agenda, or get lost! It Chapter Two opens up with a hate crime. From there, we establish nothing except that ITS BACK! We unite the Losers Club from the previous film, fast forward 27 years. ( So its the year 2016, did I do the math right?) They're not kids anymore, but still just as afraid as yesterday. Mike knew, and is ready with a fountain of knowledge on how to destroy IT once and for all. They go separate ways, so that they can find artifacts from their childhood to use as a sacrifice to the Ritual Of Chud, which is the only way to destroy the killer clown. Problems arise when each one of them is re-terrorized in excruciating but non lethal ways. With the exception of Adrain Melon and a blink and you miss it shot of a child getting torn apart, IT Chapter Two remains completely bloodless for the first half of the film. (Sighs) We came to see horror, did we not? What's more horrifying then a killer clown from space? How about we discuss the book for a change, is everyone cool with that? If you've read the book, you know that Tom, Beverlys husband, gets his butt brutally and violently handed to him, but the director choose to go the cheap route...I almost preferred the way it was handled in the mini series, at least then, I didn't have any high expectations then the expectations I expected to see in an R rated movie. The film does have a few surprises, and I say a few, because, well, those surprises are gift wrapped and bow tied with the wonderful help of CGI, otherwise they would have been BIG surprises. Have little expectations from IT Chapter Two, and it probably won't disappoint you. My main problem with the film comes with the ending, I am NOT happy with who delivers the final blow to IT ( Hint: It's not the one from the book. Which sucks, because this was suppose to be a vendetta against IT, not just destroying it.) I didn't feel they were creative enough with IT Chapter Two, maybe they should have spent more then five months on the project. Bottom line, IT nails. And fails. Ties certain elements from the first film in here, but leaves other ties hanging. Pennywise The Clown? Not as energetic as the original, not near as entertaining, and less creative. Even the clown head with spider legs just looked plain silly then scary. I have many beefs with IT Chapter Two, but I will applaud them on their flying colors....whatever they may be. I'm giving this piece six out of ten stars.",6,1,1,9 September 2019
Jaws," I did not understand the movie!
","Jaws always had his mouth open, why didn't they just toss a live grenade in his mouth, instead of torquing around with this bully fish? Aside from that thought, this is the real deal, folks. Drama, suspense, and horror all melded into one. Stevens best movie, thanks, Steven. You are forgiven for everything you made past 1989 until now!",8,1,4,26 July 2018
The Terminal," What makes this movie so great?
","I can't figure it out. Pretty much, we're just dealing with a man who is literally trapped at an airport terminal. He can't go back, he can't leave, and he can't stay at the terminal, either. What's a man to do? You would think for a 2 hour movie that this would be long and boring, right? It's not! I don't know how, but this movie kept my full attention for some reason. Perhaps it was Tom Hanks mind blowing performance. I don't know, all I know it was unbelievable how good this movie was. It's serious on the surface, but deep inside, this is almost a comical approach in the 'what iffy' zone. I loved Hanks strange accent, he nailed this role perfectly. And Speilberg? I have to hand it to you, I don't like you, but you know how to direct a movie. The pacing is brilliant, the reactions are realistic, and altogether, I just thought this was a great movie. To this day, I'm not sure what makes it so great.",7,0,0,14 January 2020
Back to the Future Part II," Lots of twists. Lots of turns. Lots of pardoxes. But fun!
","This sequel finds Marty McFly in a heap of trouble, more then before. This time, he has to save his son from a disaster outcome in the year 2015. He has to go back to 1955, to prevent an event from happening, and keep in mind, all the while, he has to return to the year 1985, his home year! Biff steals the time machine, and makes himself rich knowing what and when is going to happen, and its not going to benefit any of the McFlys here. Meanwhile, he has to save Emmet Brown, who was accidentally transferred to the year 1885 after the Delorian exploded. ( However, that's a lead off to the third entry) And there's much, much more. This overstuffed film comes with many surprises, many twists, many turns, many paradoxes, but you're going to have a blast continuing the adventures of Marty Mc Fly ( Yes! Adventures here!) 6 out of 10 stars!",6,1,1,13 April 2020
Shrek," it's a fairy tale for adults....and the kids
","Most of the overtones and the jokes will fly over the kids heads, they were smart with that. If you're an adult though, you'll get it! Shrek is a wonderful movie that's geared towards adults, but your kids will love it too. Shrek is an angry, independent ogre, and he only seems to have one care in the world...his swamp! When Lord Farquaad, the greatest ruler of his part of the kingdom, orders all the fairy tale icons out of the land, and into Shreks swamp, Shrek doesn't take too kindly to them being there, so he makes a special trip to the kingdom to confront this Lord Farquaad to get his swamp back. Along the way, he has an annoying sidekick donkey, a wise cracking hyper animal that doesn't know the meaning of keeping his mouth closed. It's quite simple: Shrek has to rescue the princess, bring her to the Lord, and in exchange, Lord Farquaad will surrender the deeds to his swamp. Things get complicated though, when one of them falls in love, and the princess demands to be rescued by prince charming, not a silly green ogre. Will any of this be resolved in harmony. Shrek was a great movie, with MIke Meyers as the voice for Shrek, and Cameron Diaz as Princess Fiona, and Eddie Murphy as the joke a minute donkey, you're going to have no choice but to enjoy Shrek right down to the last minute!",8,0,0,14 January 2020
The Silence of the Lambs," slightly over rated, but great classic thriller
","Silence Of The Lambs is, in my opinion, one of the most emotionally charged thrillers ever filmed. Slightly over rated ( I did not feel it was good enough to win Best Picture at the time), and a bit uneven at times, but it does tell quite a compelling and engrossing story. Foster plays the role of Clarice Starling, a very young trainee at the FBI academy. She is assigned a case that will almost guarentee her a certified license of the FBI, but it won't be easy. It seems the Senators daughter has been kidnapped, and the branch seems to strongly suspect that it is tied in with the Buffalo Bill victims. These victims have been found, all female, and all missing several, various skin patterns from their bodies. All of the information that Starling needs to catch this freak is in the hands of one man, Dr. Hannibal Lechtor. There's only one problem...he won't talk to anybody. When he finally meets Clarice, he seems to melt at the first sight of her, and he does talk to her. He slowly gives her the information that she needs, but it's not for free. Through a bizarre, unique 'pro quo', the doctor releases her data on one of his patients, who he is even convinced is the killer at large. ( Pro quo is a, 'what's in it for me'? deal in which Foster must reveal something about herself, in order to get what she wants. Here's where it gets tricky. And this is all plays out beautifully: Clarice is warned that Lechtor is slicker then ice, and was strongly advised that 'you do not want this man inside your head.' Unfortunately, that is where Clarice is allowing him to go, at the mercy of him giving her the name of the patient that is going around with the nickname Buffalo Bill. And we learn why. It's not because she wants her FBI badge, she really cares about the victim who may or may not still be alive. She has a glimmer of hope that she is alive, and that she can indeed save her. Out of all victims, she just wants to save one. But can she save her own sanity while doing so? The Silence Of The Lambs is not a perfect movie, and neither was the book. I found a lot of it implasussible, and the over dramatic cinematography prevented me from giving this piece 8 stars. ( The end of the film, when Clarice is holding the phone, and she says the doctors name over and over like a skipping CD, when it is clear that he has hung up the phone, is an excellent example of what I am talking about. ) And it cannot be denied Hopkins stole the show with his performance. Scary and gruesome as hell, I think this still reigns supreme to this very day.",7,5,11,18 December 2017
Vanilla Sky," a twist here, a twist there, ONE MAJOR twist, makes one twisted movie
","Pay attention very carefully, and I promise you....you still will not be able to figure this one out. The ONE MAJOR TWIST slaps you across the face like an angry mother, and leaves you standing slack jawed ( You won't see it coming, unless someone spoiled it for you.) The problem with Vanilla Sky is that I can admire the creativity used here, and I can give credit where credit is due. However, where do you draw the line in the sand, and say that your film is already unique, that you don't have to go out of your way to make it even more out of the norm then it is. Simply put: I thought this movie was a little too messed up for the average audience to watch. If I found any other complaints with the film, I do not remember it, its been awhile since I watched this, as it is an older title. Sometimes, a line has to be drawn, otherwise, the way I see it, it prevents your film from being enjoyable. It's not saying that this wasn't enjoyable. To an extent, it was. It's not just one that leaves you, wanting others to see it too. 'DID YOU SEE VANILLA SKY YET?' It's not happening. Vanilla Sky is just one of those films that just served its purpose in its time era, and that was it. It quickly evaporated, not leaving even a trace of evidence as being anything remotely associated with an understanding, or even compassionate audience that supports all the work done here. Let's face it, its clear they worked hard on this film. From what I remember, all hearts and souls were poured into this...maybe even a little too much. ( This was the movie where Penelope...oh, never mind!) To even give away a summary of the film would be spoiling it, as it may and will give away some of the key points to the film. It's just all about how its put together. Sure, it will all come together, but it leaves a picture of a puzzle where some of the pieces were forced in that doesn't belong there. I can say this, the cinematography was amazing, in my opinion, maybe even the best of any film I have seen in 2001. The film excels, and then it seems to take a step back, and the minute it gets boring, it seems to decide to excel again by relying on another twist, and weather or not this twist works or not, it still leaves you watching. It leaves you wondering, what's going to happen next? It's a mystery, but it's a psychological mystery more then anything. I can't say anything more without spoiling the milk here, so if this sounds like your cup of coffee or tea, please drink up....and enjoy. Or at the very least, enjoy some stunning performances.",7,2,2,7 February 2019
Fifty Shades of Grey," Yes! You're all so correct! It's the worst movie ever!
","Let me jump on the band wagon with you! It's terrible! Terrible film! Did you see the emotional depth in that movie? Such a terrible, horrible movie! How dare they make a movie that absorbs you like a sponge. Shame on them! Cinematography was amazing, and it was so dark, you could barely see what was going on! How can I watch a movie if I can't see what's going on? I mean, what were they thinking? Are you complaining that it was nothing like the book? Well, that's why I quit going to the library, if there's any good books there, they'll find them, make a movie about it, and the movie is just going to wreak compared to the book, because the movie won't have any pages to it, and it will give you salty reviewers something else to belly ache about! ( Sighs) So that's out of the way, let me jump OFF the band wagon now. Fifty Shades of Grey is anything but an exciting film. It's not intended to be. What we have here, is a man who has close to everything, and yet close to nothing at the same time. He has more money then he knows what to do with, and he lives a life many of us can only dream about. He has it all, right? Wrong. He is deprived. He's almost a lost, tortured soul. If there's one thing Mr. Grey doesn't know how to do, it's how to love a woman. He can fall in love with a woman, but he doesn't know how to love one. The way he's built, as a person, something messed up in that brain of his, wants to dominate his partner. He's a dominant. He wants YOU to be his submissive partner. This time, however, its a little different. Mr.Grey seems to have finally connected with someone. someone he wants to get to know a little better, someone who he wants to protect. someone he wants to...dominate...still....in a love like relationship. He makes it clear what he does, and he does not want to make her uncomfortable doing this either. So the film patiently drags us through drama hell, it takes us 40 minutes into the movie before he even shows her his 'Play room'. ( And, no, sweetie, he doesn't have a X Box.) If you don't like romance, if you don't have patience, and you are not tolerable of people who think a little different, stay away from 50 Shades of Grey. And please, if you have anything bad to say about this movie, keep it off of the reviews. because we already have enough reviewers bashing this work.",7,2,3,24 March 2019
Tombstone," See you at Tombstone!
","This 1993 western has it all. Great casting, great performances, and a showdown at the OK Corral. Lots of shoot them up action, and Wyatt Earp, alongside Doc Holiday. Who could want more? Val Kilmer and Kurt Russell pull off some mind blowing performances, and the action and tension just doesn't let up. I thought the story could have been a little better, a little smoother, but all in all, this was a decent western for its time. The 90's didn't have a lot of them, the only other one I can recommend is Unforgiven with Clint Eastwood, but aside from that, THIS IS IT! Stunning imagery, and a great quick draw scene, Tombstone is a winner!",7,2,3,23 November 2019
Bruce Almighty," He's got the power. But does he have everything it takes to be....God?
","Bruce is having a bad moment after a bad moment, to the point where he's screaming at the sky 'Why do you hate me so much!?' Almost all of us have done it, but Bruce....he's doing it a little too much. So much, that God talks to him on a broken phone, and is just fed up with Bruce thinking that he's picking on him. God comes down, has a quick conversation with Bruce, and says 'You think you can do my job better? Here you go!' He gives Bruce all of his powers, and suddenly, just like that Bruce is God! Well, sort of. He's still Bruce, but with the job of being God. You think God is picking on you? Let's just God doesn't have the time to pick on anyone, there's too much to do! Especially listening and trying to answer all those prayers, He's just one person. Bruce Almighty, IMHO, was the very last of Careys funny films, and even this one slips on his full comic strengths. Not exactly a waste, and I thought this film was funny, uplifting, bizarre and strangely moving. A bit over the top in some places, some scenes I thought I was watching Mary Poppins ( CALL HIM appears in the sky, say it aint so!) All in all, this is flawed, far from victorious effort from Jim Carey, but worth noting. Final film directed by Tom Shadac that features Jim Carey, make Bruce Almighty your pick for the morning, and start your day off right!",7,0,0,6 July 2020
Mr. Holland's Opus," an influential story
","An influential story that takes place over the years. It's about a teacher who forces his love for music straight down the throats of his students. And then they become influenced. One teacher doesn't agree with his ways, and tries to interfere . Kind of like in Dead Poets Society, oh wait, is there similarity here? Same movie, just a different title. Except in Dead Poets Society, it was literature lover, not music lover. His son cannot hear, he's deaf. His time is invested with his students, instead of with his family. Great leader, huh? Mr. Hollands Opus has great potential, great story, great music, and great memories. You will smile, cry hard, and love this film as a whole.

It doesn't matter, he and his friends were destined to die. There time, essentially, was up, but they cheated death. Death is coming after them, one by one, to do the job of ending their lives, plane crash or not. However, are there a few clauses, a few loop holes, to cheating Death itself. Perhaps. Maybe.

The Purge," could have been better...a lot better
","The Purge has an interesting concept: one day a year, to control the population crisis, a day of crime is perfectly legal. Do whatever you want. Commit any crime. Murder whoever you please. Don't want to join in on the fun? Stay inside, and hope nobody breaks in. And whatever you do, do not, under any circumstances, let anyone in your home! This is the reckoning day for many. The Purge had potential, but the direction they decided to go with the plot...I don't know. I was let down. Basically, not to spoil anything, instead of focusing in on various areas, various people, various crimes, were stuck with one setting , and it just grows old real quick. Violent? Barely. The Purge captures a sense of fear, it captures the feel of danger, and that intense atmosphere. The acting is not bad. But if the plot is lacking, so is the story. If the story is lacking, your imdb stars are lacking. 5 out of 10 from me. PS: Many people say that The Purge Anarchy is a much better movie, so I just take their word for it. You do not need to watch this one to watch that one, I believe they are unrelated.",5,0,0,3 July 2018
Footloose," oh no, what have you done?
","Remakes. Reboots. Remakes. Reboots. Hollywood is stuck in a vicious cycle, releasing up to date versions of classic hits, and they just can't seem to leave the 80's alone! Footloose was one of them, and when it comes to feet, Footloose 2011 trips over their own. The colors that made the 1984 film so great....not here! The music that made the 1984 film so great....gone! The magic that made the 1984 film so great....doesn't exist here. And the story and romance, the mind blowing energies that made the 1984 film such a hit....it's not here, people. So what does 2011 Footloose have to offer you? Not much. Bland performances, pathetic dances to songs that already nobody listens to anymore, and not a rich character in the cast to be seen. It's as if they took all the meat and potatoes out of the picture, and just left you with scraps and fat....well, heh heh heh....we can't make blockbusters like that, can we, boys and girls? Lazy, feels rushed, and it's just not upbeat enough, if at all, to even carry the Footloose name. If you want to 'loose' anything, lose the attitude that you're going to make a lot of money off of films that never needed a reboot to begin with. What can I say. Some stars just don't shine. And none of the stars shine in 2011 Footloose. Oh no, what have you guys done to our beloved 80's classic? Pulled the meat cleaver out, and THWACKED on it! Too many hits with the weapon makes this a miss, pass it up by all means, and do yourself a favor....if you're tired of all the remakes and reboots, say NO to Hollywood, and start watching indie films. Independent films don't believe in it and the dumb sequels. They just make great movies. Hollywood deserves to suffer.",4,1,2,15 May 2020
Cloud Atlas," a film a little ahead of its time ( it will find its true audience one day, trust me)
","To make a film that did not succeed at the box office, but will succeed in pleasing fans later, congratulations....you're film did not fail in my eyes. This is true talent, and only a handful of filmmakers have succeeded in such milestones. Cloud Atlas was a little ahead of its time, but I have no doubt it will find its true audience one day. Myself, I could not get into it, believe me, I have tried. However, I have no doubt that this is a solid piece of work, and from what I've seen, a lot of time and efforts were put forth here. The film itself is incredible, posing elements such as dark humor, violence, and seamless time shifts with multiple characters taking on multiple roles. From what I've seen, this is a wonderful film, however, it is not a film for everyone. I've seen enough to boast its colorfulness, its creativity, and its sense of passion for what it does as a whole. This movie works, quite well, and it has many amazing surprises. It was just made a little ahead of its time. Ten, maybe twenty years from now, people will be talking about Cloud Atlas. And you can thank them now for it, too.",8,2,4,2 February 2019
Apollo 13," Praise again for Ron Howard
","If they're smart enough to put you in space, they're smart enough to bring you back home...with or without the module. Apollo 11 was the first to land on the moon, and Apollo 12 second, respectively. Apollo 13 would have been the third, however, a change in plans after an explosion, leaves the NASA team putting their brains together to bring these men back home. It will require the team to follow commands carefully, as there is no wiggle room for error here. Their resources, including water, are very limited. Sacrifices have to be made, but they are made. They have one shot at glory, and glory is the mission now. Ron Howard has once again helmed a great film, and although difficult to watch this team struggle in peril, the feeling is REAL for any viewer who can understand the fear that they all had that they were not going to be able to come back to Earth. Stunning performances by Hanks and many more, Apollo 13 may not delight you, but it will leave you with a happy ending.",8,0,1,28 February 2019
Click," Click is damaged goods ( but at least good)
","First and foremost, I'm going to pretty hard on Click, so be warned. I'm going to shoot you straight as an arrow on this flick. Far from terrible, which is what you would expect with a Happy Madison production, but far from deserving of all the praise it got and still gets to this day. Click is just okay. If anyone gave this more then six stars, don't be misled. It's maxed out at 6 stars, given a fair shake of course. A young man who works more at his job more then spending time with his family gets a remote control that...well, controls the universe. Amazing what you can get at Bed Bath & Beyond. So go to the beyond part of the store, and there's your remote control. We could have made a million of these, sold them for ten bucks a piece, and made 10 million dollars off it, but we just built one, and its all for you, Michael Newman! Absolutely no strings attached. Batteries not included. Hit the power button, the movie itself will shut down. The movie then takes us on his guide through the world of the remote, we should see tutorials, etc, instead, were listening to the 25,000 Dollar Pyramid Game theme! Huh, what? He can rewind, fast forward, he can pause the kids playing in the background for whatever God busted reason, but just keep in mind....this is HIS remote. HE'S IN CONTROL. So we think. The plot is about to get thick. It seems easy, right. Hit the fast forward button, he can skip arguing with his loved one. So while he's skipping, what happens to him. Oh, he's on auto pilot, he eats cereal super slow motion, while time literally passes him by, and he's not only NOT spending time with his family, but he's fast forwarding through the lessons that life tries to teach him. I think. Am I overthinking the film? Because I'll tell you what, the film does NOT have any direction that it wants to stay on. It's a fantasy, it's a comedy, it's a drama, it's a wonderful life, then it suddenly wants you to take it seriously, then it wants to make you cry, then the viewers emotions are tricked into thinking that they watched something good, and then your slapped right across the face with such a generic ending, an ending that made me wonder if the filmmakers knew what they created to begin with. So this remote control was specially made to ruin someones life? Or are they suppose to learn from it. How about we all learn from life without the remote, that's what we all do, anyway. For entertainment purposes, we play along. However, trying to make sense of the entire film is mind numbing. Its amazing how many people just disregard the logic side of it all. What, for example, happens when he loses the remote? If someone else picks it up, and starts fooling with it, does it affect their lives, or his? I understand that I may be looking too deep into the film, but for a film that demands to be deep deserves to be criticized as such, and that's why I'm being so hard on it. If you wanted to go the comedy route, go that route, and stay on it! This film just gets away with swerving, U turning, and just going all over the place, and people are okay with it because...well, that's just Happy Madison. No. It's just an excuse. You can put food in an igloo, but don't call it an ice box! From the director of The Waterboy, Click is far from disappointing, but far from rational and exciting, either. It's fine until you can see through the smoking mirrors.",6,0,1,28 August 2019
Jackie Brown," Better then I expected
","Jackie Brown is better then I expected, however, I have to question all the praise that it's gotten even after all these years. Granted, its well crafted, its pretty solid, I liked how the stories inter weaved into sort of a slick, mystery paced thriller, but there's just a few things that brought down the rating for me. Let's start with the length of the movie. Did they really need to drag this out to a two and half hour movie? The answer, quite simply, is NO. This could have been wrapped up an hour and 45 minutes tops, and still have been a great movie. Jackie Brown is pretty much set in 70's style, and the setting for the time line is spot on excellent. The story sort of bops from one thing to the other, but its cleverly interlaced, almost feels like a tailor flawlessly sewing the film together, into an intricate, crime spree plot that keeps the viewer watching. Again! Some of the things that brought down the rating. Did they have to use the word over 30 times. Nope! Maybe they could have uttered it 3, 5 times tops. Still would have been a great movie. I understand this is the way people talked in the 70's, however, I strongly suspect that Tarantino abused the priviledge, given his history I would call a rap sheet, now if I'm wrong, I'm wrong, but I really don't believe I am. He purposely goes for the over the top feel of it all, and Jackie Brown is no exception to almost all of his movies. Some scenes are prolonged, stretched out....for example, a scene finds a man singing the same song over and over in his car, for no reason at all. There's a scene where a woman wipes her dirty feet on a wine glass.....now, I have to question why all these scenes are there, for no reason at all, and yet the reason is all too clear: It's just an excuse to beef up the time. Period. Why, I may ask, when your film would have been fine if you removed all the fat and just left the meat. Many viewers may overlook or justify all these scenes, but I myself have to question it. Altogether, this is a film that examines the 'make you or break you' for one person in general, and the outcome that affects the many people around her. It kept my attention, it kept my watching.....but I just have to question that it got this much praise. It was good, but it wasn't that good. I'm going to give Jackie Brown 7 out of 10 stars. Worth a look? Absolutely. Many will disagree with my review, and I'm perfectly okay with that. There's other reviews that can deter your attention from what I'm pointing out. Use them freely.",7,0,0,10 January 2020
The Cabin in the Woods," clever film loaded with surprises ( and laughs!)
","This movie knocks every ball out of the park for a grand slam homerun, and it has to be seen to be believed. I'm still blown away at how cleverly everything was executed. I cannot and will not reveal anything about the plot, the less you know the better...all I can tell you is that you are in for a night full of surprises, laughs, and even sprays of blood. I've never seen anything like this, and I've seen quite a few, but The Cabin In the Woods is unlike any horror movie I have ever seen. The acting, the cinematography, and there's even a few jump scares....laced with humor, wit, wisdom, and mystery. Added to the mix, is a bit of raw emotion, silliness, and plenty of bizarre characters. Again, I cannot reveal the plot, I cannot spoil the fun and surprises in store for you,and I can only hope the rest of the reviews have abide by the same philosophy. This is a very unique film, its not your typical horror film. To be fair, its actually a spoof of many elements that exist in other horror movies, and yet its in a class by itself. Interested? You should be, I highly praise and recommend The Cabin In the Woods for you rental. It will not fail to amaze you!",8,0,1,8 February 2019
Braveheart," Solid film
","Braveheart was a solid film. It focuses in on one man who revolts a war against the king of Scotland for two reasons. One, is for revenge of a wrongdoing done to his family. Two, is for freedom from the royal crown. Everyone is afraid, and lacking a hero. Feast your eyes on Braveheart! If you can hear him galloping on his horse, its already too late....he's taking you and your friends out one by one, ending the lives in extreme brutality of everyone who betrayed him, and giving the country the freedom they long deserved. Unquestionably, this was Gibson at his very best, he roared with stylish action, however, my complaints on the film are numerous. I felt the film was over extended way beyond its running time. While the acting was astonishingly great, it felt there was either something missing, or too much of a good thing here, but either way, the film is far from perfect, and the cracks show from my perspective. This was one I could only watch one time, as the brutal and violent nature of the movie kept me from watching it again. The film has high tension and high levels of energy, could very well be the most energetic film from the mid 90's as we know it. Historically, I found it incorrect, but I think as long as you go into this and enjoy the film for what it is and don't nitpick and try to correct its mistakes, it should be a wonderfully engrossing film for your late evening viewing. I give Braveheart 7.5 out of 10 stars.",7,0,2,24 March 2020
The Breakfast Club," they couldn't be any more different....and they couldn't be any more the same.
","The Breakfast Club is a 1985 film written and directed by John Hughes. Right from the beginning intro, David Bowies quote sets the tone and foundation for what this film is all about. Five high school students meet on an early Saturday morning for detention, where they will spend the next nine hours together in the school library. Nine hours, and they are told to write an essay on who they think they are, no less then 1,000 words. This group starts the day as individuals, but by the end of the day, they become known as a group, 'The Breakfast Club', as within the nine hours, they start out seeing how different they are, but by four o' clock, they are shocked to find out the similarities they have in common. They start off as bickering enemies, but the kid dubbed 'The Criminal' ( Judd Nelson) manages to mellow most of them out with his supply of weed that he keeps in his locker. It's still not enough to end the tension between this group. It will take plenty of talking, plenty of debates, and plenty of argument and judgment for these kids to really get to know one another. Once they get to the bottom of what's really making them hurt on the inside, they begin to see their root of the problem is stemming from the same root. Frustrations, angst, and sometimes full blasts of anger come to a head between them all, but through the fire, they end up walking out of the school hand in hand....almost hand in hand. The Breakfast Club concentrates on emotional depth rather then plot. It will not bore you, however. 8 out of 10 jobs, and fantastic efforts from a well missed and respected writer /director John Hughes.",8,0,1,15 April 2020
Born on the Fourth of July," Being patriotic can be your best friend. It can also be your worst enemy.
","This was a very hard film to absorb. First and foremost, if you're looking for a great war film, I want to direct you away from this title, and feast your eyes on Platoon, I had just watched this on vudu not too long ago. I knew it was a great movie, but I couldn't watch it at the time of its release because of the disturbing content. Born On the Fourth of July is not a great war movie. I wouldn't even call it a great movie. It is, however, a film that follows the life and times of Ron Kovic. Ron is hero, regardless of how you view this film. It's a story of how one believes in his country, but understands all too late that his country doesn't believe in him. I want to give a personal shout out to all those soldiers who have fought or are currently fighting for the red white and blue. I, myself, was born on the fourth of July. ( Tom Cruise himself missed it by a day...he was born July 3) While I did not dislike the film, I can't say I enjoyed it, either. Everything seems lost in translation, and the fact that the movie abruptly ends without hearing Ron give his speech made me scream 'SO WHAT WAS THE POINT TO THE MOVIE!?' The point, as I see it, is it just seems to follow what one believes in, one man trying to be a great person, a great hero in life, and feeling betrayed by his country, he becomes anti war. Personally, I don't believe in the governments or the wars they fight, its all too political, and I feel that money should be spent elsewhere. ( If you want to argue my point of view, my final thought is to look at Canada. Look at how many wars they fought versus us. I rest my case!) I got the feeling as if Ron just wore his heart on his sleeve. That's a trait of being a Cancer, and I felt so bad for him when he was paralyzed, and asking the doctor the question of weather he would ever be able to have children. That, too, is another trait of a Cancer, we love children. Family is everything to us. Being stripped from being the man that he was ( and the whole facade is that you go into the military to BE a man. Well said.) , he turns to his old prom date to begin a rally that will rage a war against the war itself. Why fight for a country that doesn't care if you're alive or dead, and why fight for a country that won't take care of you when you're wounded. The film does an excellent job of capturing the piss poor treatment the soldiers get in the VA hospitals. Nice going, I like the exposure! However, the emotional atmosphere is just all over the place with the film, we don't know weather to like him, dislike him, root for him, or question anything that he says or does. All in all, this was a good chunk of Kovics life. And, as he says in the film, its America. Love it or leave it.",6,1,2,26 March 2019
Jurassic Park," Great movie if you like to see dinosaurs attack people
","Steven. Steven. Steven. I don't know what you were thinking. Here's an idea that must have struck him at like 4 o clock in the morning. I got a great idea! Let's put kids in an amusement park, in the dark, with a bunch of dinosaurs who do NOT abide by the rules of civilization, and let's watch them try and survive the night. ( Sighs!) This is the core of 1993's Jurassic Park, a dark and scary ride into the modern day, prehistoric times. Great movie is you like to see a dinosaur attack a person from a porter potty! Actually, all joking aside, I thought the film was incredible in its detail with the dinosaurs alone. We can't knock that! Incredibly done for its time, too. Cinematography was GD amazing! Now, on to the downs of Jurassic Park. Story telling? Starts of strong, but then it just becomes extreme chaos once the dinosaurs start running amok. Watching children in peril cannot be one of your weaknesses for this one, trust me. And it's so violent, I don't know how it got away without an R rating. ( Oh, wait. It's Steven! That's why! He got away without an R rating with Jaws and Poltergeist, too! Silly me!) Bottom line: It's worth a watch! I cannot ever watch this again, but I cannot let the pluses of this film go unnoticed, either. I gave it 7/10 stars.",7,0,0,1 March 2020
Beetlejuice," say it once! say it twice! say it three times!
","Barbara and Adam are a perfectly cute couple together, and enjoying their nice new home. Things are going great, until an accident behind the wheel claims both of their lives. They quickly catch on to the fact that they are dead, but they haven't moved on, they are still living in the house...as ghosts. Upon finding a book in the house, which is a handbook for the recently deceased, they have everything they need to know to live their lives in the land of the dead, which includes haunting and scaring people if needed. There's only one problem: Neither one understands the book. And the time to haunt and scare is now, because new people have arrived in their home. This family is unacceptably weird. The only one in the family who can carry on a decent and intelligent conversation with is Lydia, who Barbara quickly becomes fond of, but the rest? Not so much. A few haunts and scares go unnoticed, and Adam and Barbara are becoming annoyed by living with this insane household at breakneck speed. Desperate for help, they call for an emergency, which requests them to 'draw' a door. Unaware of the fact that they are going to be spending over 100 years in this house, and unaware that these emergency calls are very limited, they learn that they have a case worker who may be able to help them. Their case worker, a cranky but likable old woman, doesn't see that they need any help, that they just need to read and understand the handbook that was provided for them. Frustrated by the book because they can't understand it, they become extremely desperate to rid this family. How? This family is just too weird to scare away. Late one night, an ad for a bio exorcist appears, an unsettling but energetic guy who calls himself Beetleguise ( Beetlejuice is easier to say), they are both intrigued, but hesitant of asking for help, especially since he's exposed just how wacky he is. When Barbara asks about him to Juno, their case worker, she strongly warns and suggests that they do not want his help, that they need to get the family out themselves. She explains briefly about him being problematic, that he used to work for her. Desperate for help, however, they turn to Beetlejuice by calling upon his name three times. Beetlejuice appears, very hyper, very unorthodox, but very eager to do something destructive. Thinking that this is the solution to their problems was a bad move. Now released, and with no way of knowing how to put him back where he came from, Adam and Barbara have unleashed a new problem to their list. Beetlejuice is good at what he does, but he does what he wants, not what's asked of him. And Beetlejuice is after Lydia, who Barbara has become very protective over. What does Beetlejuice REALLY have planned for this little girl, and can Barbara and Adam figure out a way to stop him. With an imaginative and creative story, and mind blowing special effects ( back then), and a strong cast of characters, Beetlejuice is a perfect escapade from reality for the entire family to enjoy.",8,0,0,18 May 2019
V for Vendetta," Brilliance, energy, stylish and outlandish. I haven't talked about the good stuff yet!
","V for Vendetta is an amazing film. It roars with stylish action, it soars with brilliant energies, and it's laced perfectly with an emotional element that touches your heart and soul. V for Vendetta....a film not just about rebellion, but about fear. The governments should be afraid of the people, we should not fear the government. Why? Because there's more of you then there are them! You outnumber them! All it takes is one leader. One leader, and all they need is one follower. Together, they can harness what it takes to take on Berlin, who has destroyed its own cities with corruption. It's not just about the war for freedom, it's about the war within our own bodies, the war to find who we truly are deep inside. V for Vendetta was incredibly mastered and done, an amazing masterpiece that boasts liveliness and strong colors. Backed by powerhouse performances and an outstanding soundtrack, V for Vendetta is a must see for not just the action lover in you, but for people who truly get it. The ones who truly understand will appreciate this gem of a film.",9,3,3,19 January 2020
