The King's Speech," Wonderful!!
","I walked into the cinema thinking I would dislike this movie - it's about royalty and their silly issues. I ended up loving it.The interaction between Geoffrey Rush (the speech therapist) and Colin Firth (the would-be King) is superb. We become aware of the vast differences between these two – in their upbringing and their station in life without it being a lecture on class differences. There is humour through-out with tremendous performances by the two above mentioned actors. We feel the struggle of both – Geoffrey Rush trying to persuade the would-be King to overcome his speech impediment and Colin Firth avoiding, but also pursuing his past to improve his speaking ability.I did feel that the performance of Helena Bonham Carter as the wife of the would-be King was somewhat overly idealized. But Guy Pierce, as the abdicating Edward, along with his future American wife, were both excellent.There are some misleading historical representations. For instance Churchill was on the side of Edward and tried to persuade him not to abdicate. But this is really minor and does not take away from the overall theme of the film.It is to the credit of the film-makers that they took this long ago forgotten piece of history and made it into a riveting drama with a wonderful script.",9,1,2,7 January 2011
Moneyball," Winning on the Cheap
","This is a fun movie provided you like sports and/or baseball – and a basic knowledge of baseball will add to the enjoyment. Its' more about the management and business side, than about the game – buts its' also about winning and how to win – in this case on a spartan budget. Baseball is more of a statistical game than others – there are numbers all over the place – innings, strikeouts, walks, hitting averages, on- base averages So it starts with general manager Billy Beane (played by Brad Pitt) getting a 'Google-boy' (played by Jonah Hill) to give him masses of statistics on players from other teams with the all-important dollar value (current player salary) in one of the columns. Using the data from these spreadsheets, along with the significant dollar column, Billy Beane wheels and deals. A dream team is built on the cheap.It's all pleasurable and funny with tantrums, business meetings with old baseball codgers eyeing Google-boy most suspiciously, and the recruitment and abrupt dismissal of players. I felt Philip Seymour Hoffman under-used (but did he ever look like a baseball coach!!) There was even some syrupy stuff of Billy and his daughter which kind of worked – this was probably tossed in to distract away from the predominant male element in this film.For a 2 hour plus movie Moneyball plays well and entertains.",7,0,1,13 January 2012
Gravity," Insipid
",This is a story of survival in outer space orbit. It's pretty standard fare camouflaged by a lot of special razzle-dazzle effects. The script is mundane and repetitive. There are one and half actors (George is killed off at the mid-point) and they barely hold your attention. George Clooney's comments are simply glib and Sandra Bullocks are variations of 'I'm in deep trouble and can't breathe' and 'Which button do I press on this spaceship'.Sandra wanders and spins and gyrates from one spaceship to another. The plot is very thin. You can watch the first 15 minutes and the last 10 minutes and basically you have the story. Watch 'Apollo 13' for a far better and intelligent story.,6,2,5,3 March 2014
Pirate Radio," Extreme juvenile
","This is pretty juvenile. The characters, the dialogue, the interaction....it's much like a comic book. Caricatures abound and women are treated as sex toys – like in a James Bond movie. If you like frat party movies this one's for ya. We are annoyingly told over and over that the female member of the crew is a lesbian. It never goes beyond the basic plot of : <ul><li>Britain bans the playing of rock'n'roll</li></ul><ul><li>guys (and one gal) on a boat off the British coast broadcast the illicit music</li></ul><ul><li>British government decides to terminate the rock'n'roll boat. </li></ul>That's all there is - for nearly 2 hours. The music is good – which brought my rating up. And the ending is a copycat of a much more famous movie which brought my rating back down.",4,1,5,3 November 2014
The Jungle Book," It's Got Personality
","This is one the Greats. It is one of the best 'Buddy' movies of all time. The animation and interaction between Mowgli, Bagheera and Baloo is wonderful. There is so much spontaneity and energy that you hardly realize as you are watching that years went into the making of this.The movie is edited to perfection with no extraneous scenes – it just moves seamlessly as the story progresses. The renditions of 'Bare Necessities' and 'I Wanna be Like You' are marvelous and etched forever as animation favourites. And the voice-overs are unique and make each character a distinct personality.The extra features on the DVD are excellent and provide a lasting legacy to this fine Disney classic. It is amazing to see how the story evolved and changed during it's creation phase. There is such much love and talent that went into making 'Jungle Book'.",9,1,3,4 December 2010
Milk," Historical Docu-drama
","This movie has a strong message to make for gay rights - and for human rights in general. I never knew much about the campaign in the U.S. to discriminate against people (remove them from a job and worse)on the sole basis of their sexual orientation.But aside from that, I feel this movie fell flat. Its a combination of documentary and drama. Some of the drama becomes repetitive - there are many scenes of boy-meet-boy which becomes somewhat like an afternoon soap opera. Sean Penn was the only real character - all the others seem to be inter-changeable side-kicks. Josh Brolin was the caricature of the disgruntled employee.It does pick up somewhat in the latter half when Harvey Milk becomes elected to public office.",6,4,16,7 December 2008
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," THE Satire
","This is definitely 'the satire' of the Cold War. It is very well filmed – as you would expect from Kubrick - and the characters are very engaging – not something I would expect from Kubrick. The plot is also very well structured, as it alternates between the bomber crew, the War room and Jack Ripper's base. Jack Ripper's portrayal is the height of paranoia and along with the role of Buck Turgidson (played by George C. Scott) these are two outstanding personalities in film.Unfortunately I felt the role of Dr. Strangelove was too over the top and rather ruined the movie's effect, particularly towards the end. Nevertheless, this is still one of best satires ever and closing in at 50 years this film still holds its' own. I also feel this is the best work of Kubrick – his later films were rather cold and unfeeling compared to Dr. Strangelove.",8,0,1,25 May 2011
The Book Thief," Over-wrought
","'The Book Thief' has good intentions but over-all I found it muddled. There were too many things going on – Liesel's relationship with her surrogate parents and with Rudy. Then there was hiding a Jewish person in the family household – and then Liesel's relationship with him. One could add other themes like the growing Nazism of the towns-folk, the Allied bombings, Liesel stealing books...The film just tries too hard when making any emotional statement. Aside from our central character I never felt any emotional connection to the others. Liesel's surrogate mother was a caricature.Although well-filmed and colourful cinematically it was bothersome to hear German accents and words popping up constantly (Ja, Nien...). The bodies of Liesel's surrogate parents and Rudy after the bombing raid look so pristine beside the ruined homes – giving additional phoniness to this film.Also that over-narration of Dr. Death added to the cloyingness.Overall the story held some interest, but I never felt much of a main focal point.",6,0,0,3 December 2016
The Town," Explosions and gun-fire aplenty
","I found this move to be a pastiche. It starts as a crime caper – bank robbers in Boston who grew up in the slums. At the beginning we witness one such robbery where they abduct a female bank employee, Claire (Rebecca Hall), and eventually release her.The robbers are worried that she may be able to identify them – so this falls to Doug (played by Ben Affleck) to determine how much Claire knows. He does more than this and they start to be attracted to each other and we have a romance developing. So far OK - the dialogue is well done and this all seems credible. One of Doug's partners, James (Jeremy Renner), comes to be aware of this budding romance and expresses concern – one of the 'townies' going out with a yuppie-uppity is disconcerting – besides she was the kidnap victim in their robbery. James witnesses the happy couple in a bistro (as opposed to a 'townie bar') – and there is a confrontation between the two crooks after Claire leaves; that again is well done. Also Claire is providing evidence to the police, who have launched a full-scale investigation of the robbery. Claire is unwittingly in a conundrum so the tension starts to mount.What ruined this movie for me are the two high-powered shoot-outs – one in the middle of the movie, and the other at the end – both are a cataclysm of gunfire, cars overturning and/or shot to pieces. I am sure more ammo was exchanged than in a typical day in Afghanistan. It was just out of proportion to the rest of the movie. The movie was gritty and approaching realism- but then Hollywood stepped in and said lets get some explosions and shoot-outs – and away we go. Sometimes all the noise and fine weaponry can be enthralling, but please save it for the appropriate movie.",5,1,2,2 March 2012
Capote," Remarkable Representation
","This is a really wonderful film that succeeds on many levels. It's a biography of a great American writer and iconoclast – Truman Capote. It's the struggle of writing a book. And it's about murder. The murder's occurred close to the small town of Holcomb in Kansas in November, 1959 and the entire film has this sombre grey November feel to it (except the scenes of Truman vacationing in Spain).Phillip Seymour Hoffman gives a complex and emotional portrayal of Capote – we see him as journalist, friend, raconteur, life of the party, and writer. He is presented as successful, brilliant, egotistical, an incisive observer and a deceitful manipulator – a person who could be many things to all the different people he encounters. We witness the struggles he has with completing his book. As Winston Churchill remarked on writing a book: 'To begin with, it is a toy and an amusement; then it becomes a mistress, and then it becomes master, and then a tyrant. The last phase is that just as you are about to be reconciled to your servitude, you kill the monster and fling him to the public.' We particularly experience this quote in the latter half of the film when Truman wants to put an end to it all.If you are at all interested in the book 'In Cold Blood' or in the life of Truman Capote this is must film. Phillip Seymour Hoffman deservedly won best Actor for his very strong performance in this film. Perry, (played by Clifton Collins) also gives a strong, but subdued role, as one of the two murderers. There are many eerie and strong one-to-one encounters – particularly when Truman is involved – they add to the tautness and mood of the entire film.All and all, even with its pervasive melancholia, this is a remarkable film.Interestingly, another film, on the same topic, was made at the time called 'Infamous'. Truman's role was played by Toby Jones, but I found his role to be too much of a caricature. I felt it lacked the strength of character of 'Capote', but that is just my opinion.",9,2,3,25 July 2012
Incendies," Intriguing
","This is a very intriguing story. Most of it takes place in war-torn Lebanon.The plot concerns the will of a mother for her twin children – a boy and girl - both raised in Montreal. They must return to Lebanon to fulfill this will and in so doing, they unravel parts of their family past they were never aware of. The story weaves back and forth between the life of the mother growing up in her native country and the daughter during her first sojourn to Lebanon. It was somewhat difficult for me, at times, to distinguish between mother and daughter in these alternating scenes.This is a film that does require close attention. It starts off rather hesitantly in Montreal and slowly develops into a full-fledged story with many rewards. But there are excruciating scenes – not a film for young children. One very potent scene is when the daughter returns to the village of her mother. The village women, upon finding out her identity, refuse any further communication with her. This sets the stage for the many layers of the puzzle needing to be resolved. And there is resolution at the end.All and all a most worthwhile experience.",8,4,13,23 February 2011
The Killing Fields," Powerful - a must see film
","This is a most powerful and visceral film. It is probably the best of the Vietnam war/drama movies even though it is not directly about that country, but of Cambodia. It clearly demonstrates how war transposes into other countries and can forever disfigure them.Although the acting is not first-rate – I do find Sam Waterston a little wooden; the story-line more then makes up for it. There are so many unforgettable passages in this film. It grabs hold of you right from the beginning and never lets' go. The music and cinematography are spectacular and add to the tension of the wrenching scenes in this movie.This is storytelling and history at its very best.",10,1,1,18 May 2011
The Orphanage," HO- Hum
","I had read many fab reviews of this film and thought I'd give it a whirl – even though I am not a big fan of the horror genre. It really didn't pan out for me. The acting is OK and the cinematography lavish. The story quickly becomes a series of over-used scary cliché's – don't go in the room, why in heaven's name are you opening the door, why are you going outside - alone – at night-time .that type of stuff. There are endless searches and sounds in the overly big horror-houseThere are many things that simply don't make much sense. They have a reception for new orphans in the house but there was no follow-up to this. Was it just there to make their adopted son conveniently disappear? Near the end of the film skeletal remains are found, but no police follow-up? It's overly lengthy. I found the ending a let-down with an unbelievably happy resolution.",4,5,11,20 February 2012
In the Name of the Father," Excellent
","An excellent drama with a very strong charismatic performance by Daniel Day Lewis who plays Gerry Conlon, an unemployed drifter. It starts in Northern Ireland and moves onto London where Gerry gets involved with another group of itinerants. He is then falsely arrested for the bombing of an English pub by the IRA, where a number of people are killed and maimed. He is sentenced to a long prison term erroneously, along with his father. It is all part of a nefarious plot by the British government to incarcerate any suspect to keep the British population content that something is being done about the bombings.Daniel Day-Lewis plays a complex character who is not entirely likable, but we do commiserate with his plight. At over 2 hours the movie never slows down. It's has tremendous conflict at all levels – in Ireland, the courtroom, the prison and the usual family father-son rivalries. It's based on a true story, but I have no idea regarding its authenticity. Highly recommended; particularly for those who love courtroom- prison dramas!",9,1,1,5 March 2012
Jackie," Mesmerizing
","Natalie Portman is mesmerizing in the role of Jackie. We feel her presence and she encompasses the mystic and the aura of Jacqueline Kennedy. Also the tremendous tragedy of this era – namely the unresolved assassination of a world leader at the apex of world power – is at the forefront of this film. The impact of those bullets on the motorcade is felt throughout this film.Natalie Portman simply overpowers all the scenes she is in. She tosses out zingers – a la Jacqueline Kennedy – that are only noticed after – as in I think she just insulted the interviewer, the state senator...As an additional caveat - if one is not familiar with this time period –if you are under 30 years of age this film may not affect you emotionally. Also the film somewhat slows towards the ending – I felt the conversations with her priest (Played by William Hurt) to be tedious and overly theological/philosophical sagging the overall impact.",8,5,11,24 January 2017
The Commitments," Soul Power
","Really a Fun movie to watch.Its got energy, its got laughs – and Soul!Character interactions are Great. There's plenty of rivalry. It's a band that's starting out and trying to put itself together. The lead manager played by Robert Arkins holds the film together and is the centerpiece. Nothing ever goes smoothly with plenty of cussin' and shoving and pushing. Great dialogue but the sub-titles helped me in the understanding.The music is superb – once they get their act together.There is not a dull moment from beginning to end.",9,0,1,24 November 2016
The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford," And the point is?
",I failed to see any point in this movie. It is certainly artistic with several Andrew Wyeth type scenes. But there are a plethora of characters who are interchangeable and look alike. There is a voice over that desperately tries to make this movie appear to be a serious undertaking. What we get for over 2 hours is a lot of style with a lot of postcard scenes. Was there any editing done in this movie at all? Or did everyone believe that this was an artistic masterpiece? It's mostly visual pretentiousness.It's a very long movie and the seasons and the scenery change rapidly. There are scenes and dialogue that appear for appearance sake. In the end do we really care about Jesse James?,3,0,2,13 February 2010
To Rome With Love," A Good Outing for Woody
",This is definitely an amusing and funny Woody Allen comedy – I laughed out loud a few times. It consists of several stories – none connected to the other and each with a different theme. Not all are of the same calibre – but let's start positively. Woody is hilarious and in fine form. Roberto Benigni adds a lot of energy as I would have expected. Penelope Cruz is simply hot and exudes her charms – a lot of her scenes are a hoot.However Jesse Eisenberg is simply tiresome – he has no tonality and I simply find him boring. Ditto for Ellen Page. All their scenarios slowed the pace and made it tedious. Same for Alec Baldwin – the dialogue was predictable. And the opera bath-tub singing was simply overdone – we got the message after the first couple of times – no need to repeat endlessly.Anyhow I enjoyed this more than 'Midnight in Paris' – Woody added zest in this Italian version.,7,1,6,20 July 2012
The Grand Budapest Hotel," Great!!
","Entertaining, great characters (many of them!), magnificent cinematography, at times outrageous, sometimes violent, mostly funny, quirky, wonderful character sketches and buddy attachments - particularly between Ralph Fiennes and Tony Revolori, unpredictably hilarious, Andrien Brody surprisingly menacing, Willem Dafoe the new Terminator, fantastic scenery, keeps you watching, never a dull moment, highly original, its like a moving canvas with constant surprises, dialogue is superbjust loads of fun with a neat story-lineWhat More Can you want???",8,1,10,20 March 2014
Foxcatcher," A powerful build-up
","I was slowly taken in by this film. It just grew on me and took me into its world. Its' slow-paced and very subtle. Don't worry, it's much much more than just wrestling.It's character driven and the performances by Steve Carell and Channing Tatum are really understated and but also powerfully riveting. That may sound somewhat contradictory but it just goes to show that histrionics are not a requirement for superb acting. This film has such a slow wind-up that you never see quite know where it is going. It moves quietly, but intensely from scene to scene.This may not be for all the action CGI types, but its' great cinema.",8,0,0,7 July 2015
Patton," George C. Scott is Stupendous!!
","Truly a commanding performance by George C. Scott. It is difficult to think of another biographical movie that has a portrayal as vivid and convincing as this – we feel that we are viewing the actual Patton. Scott's character has so much depth that even if you are uninterested in this epoch, you can just appreciate the range of emotions that he gives – all the way from despair to glory. Scott is all - a 'Prima Donna' to a poetic war historian to being an irate insensitive general who slaps soldiers in a hospital.The cinematography is stupendous, the soundtrack wonderful and the script by Francis Ford Coppola gives it a modern Shakespearian ambiance.",9,0,1,18 April 2011
Into the Wild," very emotional
",A very well done movie that explores the short life of a rather disturbed young man who cuts all ties to society and becomes a vagabond and eventually journeys to Alaska where he is overwhelmed by the harsh terrain and starves to death in the wilderness.The movie - to some extent - allows one to make up ones on mind about his motivations. The contacts he has with the people on his journey are very well portrayed. Perhaps there is some romanticism here and there - are all homeless people so friendly and there seems to be very little rainfall in this movie. Being alone on a highway with a back-pack can look fun when the sun is shining and the scenery beautiful.Also there is a tendency to blame parents for problems. When you become twenty it is time to stop blaming your parents for all your problems. His parents did not force him to leave home in that style - as a matter of fact he was lined up to leave home and go to Harvard - so why this strong pull to renounce ALL worldly goods? But the beauty of this movie is its very strong emotional pitch.,9,0,3,7 December 2008
Woman in Gold," Highly Recommended
","A very moving and touching film about stolen art and getting back what rightly belongs to you – even though its been years since the government stole it. This movie refers to the Nazi-Austrian governments' stealing of art treasures from the house of Austrian citizens. In particular it focuses on the stolen portrait of Adele Block-Bauer by Gustav Klimt which the Austrian government claimed it owned.Its' a very dynamic and spirited performance by the two principal actors – Helen Mirren and Ryan Reynolds. The flashbacks to the past also add to this strong and very moving story giving the film substance and essential background. The shifting between North America and Austria, along with the past lives of the characters, added to the strong tension and wholeness of the narrative. This very riveting film kept me highly engaged throughout.",9,0,1,25 April 2015
Crazy Heart," Country Cheese
","Although this is a superb and credible performance by Jeff Bridges the rest of the cast is a bit thin. I do admit that I am not much of a Country music fan. There are a few too many performances in this movie of Jeff playing in front of his adoring fans – some of whom are adoring groupies.It would have been much more credible if he would have fallen for one of those aging groupie ladies. What we get instead, is a woman who is a least half his age, swooning for him. Her performance is akin to a teenage adolescent girl making moves on a very elder high school teacher. What is it with Hollywood always believing that young girls go for old guys? The old guy, in this case, is a chain-smoking, obnoxious, whisky drinking drunkard.The only reality dose in this movie is when Jeff phones his long abandoned son who abruptly dismisses him.",6,3,7,24 January 2010
"Hail, Caesar!"," Hail the Coen Brothers!!
","From religion to communism the Coen brothers tackle all. Sure the story isn't that coherent – but I laughed a lot at this excellent script. Josh Brolin and George Clooney give strong performances. Both visuals and dialogue are a hoot. It moves rapidly from topic to topic and the imagery is relentless. It's a wonderful romp though a 50's film studio so you get epic Biblical, gorgeous female divers, a cowboy riding horses and eating beans, and even Navy tap-dancers that reminded me more of the Village People than Gene Kelly. I enjoyed the whole satire ...Hail the Coen Brothers!!",8,1,3,21 February 2016
The Water Diviner," Comic Book
",This movie disintegrated as it moved along. Its' starts off well enough with an Australian framer (Russell Crowe) and his wife who cannot face up to the fact that three of their sons (their only children) died in the Gallipoli fiasco during the First World War. It's all pretty somber – and after his wife's death our Australian farmer sets off for Gallipoli to find where his sons died – and bring the bodies back to Australia to bury them next to their mother.This is the end of the serious phase. We now transition to romance and adventure.Our farmer arrives in Istanbul – stumbles upon a young lad who brings him to a lavishly furnished inn where our farmer encounters the inn-keeper – the very alluring Olga Kurylenko. Her husband conveniently disappeared during the war. Initially she despises him – but we suspect this won't last too long. So now we have a budding romance. He sets off to Gallipoli to find his sons – and in short order befriends a Turkish general and locates two of his sons bodies. He returns to the inn – beats up an un-wanted suitor of the beautiful inn-keeper. So the romance is progressing – to the point where they examine coffee grains together (there is a lot of superstition floating about in this overly long drama). He sets off on another expedition with the Turkish general to locate the third son. Father and lost son return to the inn – and all that is needed is to show them blissfully ensconced in the Australian outback farming happily ever after – father and newly found son – with his new Turkish wife and her son. It all comes off as a wildly romantic adventure and implausible.,6,3,6,24 May 2015
Trainspotting," Glorifies Drug Use
","I could not identify with the 'world' in this film. Perhaps if one had issues with substance abuse there would be a way to relate to all the sordid events depicted. I also feel that parts of this film glorified drug use and the whole druggie environment – as in take drugs, life becomes simple and you don't have to care about anyone anymore – all problems are solved. The film has them giddily robbing people of their possessions – but a lot of addicts also sell their bodies (maybe several times a day) to get their drug money. This issue is not breached at all in film. It's a lot more cinematic and playful to show junkies stealing and running than to show them soliciting strangers to have anonymous sex.Actually this film was somewhat amoral – and the longer it went on the more tiresome it became (how many times does one need to see someone injecting heroin into his veins?). The film becomes repetitive. I found the characters bland and that of Robert Carlyle simply stupid and psychotic – as in here we go again with another violent scene with fists and beer glasses flying. As the film dragged on and on, I found myself caring less and less about these guys and their sorry little lives. I do give some credit to the director for instilling a certain rhythm to this film which almost made me watch it to the end.",5,3,11,21 July 2014
Vicky Cristina Barcelona," Not That Funny
","This film has intelligence and is well filmed. BUT - it suffers from too many words and is overly long. Generally Woody Allen puts all this relationship angst about falling in and out of love into comedy. This movie was not particularly funny. It comes off as intellectually strained - we are told over and over that Cristina is unhappy with her boring husband. Also, I kept thinking, where are these two women getting the money to eat in lavish restaurants - one is a student and the other is an amateur film-maker. Surely the artist they meet, who is driving a fancy sports car and lives in a picturesque home can't be making any money from those atrocious paintings we see. Towards the end Cristina leaves for Paris which is far more expensive than Spain. Where's the money? Only Penelope Cruz infuses needed energy into this movie.",6,2,7,7 December 2008
Fantastic Mr. Fox," Not so Fantastic
","I can only say that for whatever reasons this had little appeal to me. It is not even 90 minutes and I felt the film dragging. I liked the animation style but this only held me for so long. The story is kind of repetitive – a series of chase and hunt scenes. Also it is overly wordy – hardly a few seconds go by without someone saying something that is allegedly witty, amusing or humorous. The whole thing became rather drab with characters being constantly added to make up for the lack of a substantial story-line. It fact, overall, it lacked in emotion and was on the dry side. I would hardly say this is for children – I'm sure they would be as bored as I was.",5,6,12,25 February 2012
The Martian," Flat
","Overall this was kind of flat. It lacked dramatic flare. Given the situation of an individual being trapped on Mars I would have expected more intensity. Perhaps the movie was just too long. There were a few times where I was simply bored. The movie tended to overwhelm one with technical details.The ending could have done without crowds cheering at Times Square/Piccadilly – this seemed contrived.The cinematography was great – of both Mars and space capsule scenes. Matt Damon was adequate, but I was expecting better. The storyline worked and was rational – with no silly hocus-pocus type scenes – so this kept my rating up.",6,4,9,18 October 2015
