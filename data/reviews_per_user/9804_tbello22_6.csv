Casablanca," Masterpiece
","Released right in the middle of World War 2 this film is one of the greatest films ever made. It ranks in the top 10 of most famous critics lists of the greatest movies of all time. Humphrey Bogart gives a stellar performance about a man in love who must chose between two life changing things.I saw this movie when I was younger and watching it again made me realize how much I missed and how powerful the film was. When I watched it the first time I didn't understand much about the war and didn't know what the Vichy French were. The music in the film is incredible, it was way beyond its time and reminds me of music from movies today. Anyone who is a fan of movies needs to give this movie a chance, it defiantly wasn't what I expected. I expected a boring love story set somewhere I didn't ever hear of but it wasn't that at all. Great acting, great music and legendary scenes make for this great film.",9,0,1,11 March 2010
Citizen Kane," Good Film
",Going into this movie I was expecting to review this movie a 10 out of 10 but I didn't think it was amazingly good. This movie tops most critics lists as the greatest movie of all time and I just see it as a good film. The story is great and I love how it is told through the use of flashbacks. I love how Kane built up from a childhood in poverty to become very successful. The film is known for its cinematography and is said to be Orson Welles breakthrough film. It is one of stories that helped changed film making and there are some beautiful scenes such as the scenes when he is taken from his parents. I didn't expect Rosebud to be the name of his childhood sled that was strange. I am glad I watched this movie and its a must see for any film buff especially since it is ranked as the number 1 film by many critics. When Welles made this film he forever changed the way to make movies.,7,0,1,11 March 2010
The Birth of a Nation," Amazing Silent Film
","This movie blew me away, I was amazed by how far ahead this movie looked. When this movie was made movie just started to become popular. This movie uses techniques that no one knew about at the time Griffith's idea for this film was incredible. When it zooms on a specific thing with black edges to really get the full emotion.It is amazing to see a movie about the Civil War from the south perspective. Most films about the Civil War are intended to show how bad the black people were treated. The battle scenes are incredible and look exactly like how some of todays war films are made. When the women is being chased by the black man and jumps off the edge, it makes you shocked and to see how black people were looked at during this period. Also this scene shows two different ideas of what is going on. It shows the black man chasing then jumps to the man looking for her. When Lincoln is shot you really feel like you were there and for people in 1915 they must have been amazed at what they were seeing. At the end when the Ku Klux Klan rides in to the town to stop the black mob, they are portrayed as heroes because they kill the black people trying to hurt them. They take all the weapons away from the blacks and are marched through town.Although this is a really good film it has some issues. The biggest issue being the length of the film. For a silent film 3 hours is an extremely long time and the beginning of the movie was hard to watch but as the film went on it got better. Also the music doesn't fit very well in certain scenes. This movie is a must see for silent movie fans.",8,2,6,26 January 2010
Full Metal Jacket," Best Vietnam Film
","Out of all the Vietnam movies to me this is the best one. Better than Platoon and Apocalypse Now. Kubrick does this film in a great way, there is a lot of violence and a true vision of the Vietnam War. Most people don't think this but I enjoy the first half of the film much better while they are training for the war. You get the sense of the pain these people feel while training at boot camp. So much pain that it eventually leads to suicide.All of Kubricks films have something different about them and I have seen everyone of them and the only one I didn't like was eyes wide shut but I can't really complain about any since they are all works of art.",9,0,0,12 May 2010
Fargo," Classic
",This movie is one of the greatest films of the 90s it is very entertaining includes more than just the violence you would expect. There are some parts that are funny and the story overall is just very entertaining. Steve Buscemi takes on his usual role as the erratic crazy guy in what I think is his best role. He plays a lot of minor roles but they are always entertaining.The film references a lot of older films and older types of film making. The music is very dramatic especially in the beginning when the car is coming through the snow. The violence is incredible and seems very real. It is hard to find anything that is wrong with this film it is just to good.,9,0,0,12 May 2010
The Graduate," One of my favorites
","Parts of this movie have been spoofed in so many television shows and newer movies but I never understood what they meant until seeing this film. The Graduate is a timeless film that will go down as one of the best films ever. I love seeing a young Dustin Hoffman because I have seen so many movies with him as he was older. The film touches on a issue that wasn't shown in film and the main character seemed shy and awkward towards the older Mrs. Robinson. I love that he fights so hard for the girl toward the end and eventually they run off together.The most important part of the film is the music that is used. I believe it is only Simon and Garfunkel that put their music into the film. Some of the songs are played more than one, something you don't usually see in films. It is to hard to find anything that I can complain about this movie. It is a classic and a must see.",9,1,1,28 April 2010
