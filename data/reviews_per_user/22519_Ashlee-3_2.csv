The Blair Witch Project," Ahh, Uh, huh?
","This is what you will be saying at this movie.. I went in expecting to come out scared stiff. Instead I came out kind of confused.. I was more like Huh? Parts did give me goosebumps but others made my brain work. It's been a week since I have seen it and now I am kind of scared. The more time I have had to think about it, It becomes scarier.. It's one of those movies you have to see at least 2 times to understand and a 3rd time to be scared. Great movie I say.. But watch out for the camera angles, This movie could cause worse motion sickness than a transatlantic flight threw a hurricane.",Null,0,1,20 August 1999

","This movie, Though senseless, was so genuinely funny. I was so full of odd humor and obvious humor. However there is no room for kiddies in the room while this is on. The creators of the acclaimed Comedy Central animated series 'South Park' (Trey Parker and Matt Stone) show no discretion in this films crude humor and is not suitable for children but is incredibly funny for adults! I say Rent it TODAY or rather  Tonight!!!",Null,0,2,16 April 1999
