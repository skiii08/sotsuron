Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," It isn't Luke, Han, & Leia, but its still Star Wars
","This is a very exciting movie. It is a beginning that starts in the middle just before an end.  This is the beginning of a saga that started for us in the middle of the story.  I watched and continue to watch this movie enthralled as to what will develop next.  We know Anakin will become Vader, but how does it happen? What happened to the relationship between Obi Wan and Anakin? These are questions that start to be answered in this first installment of the Star Wars Saga. I must say that in my opinion Ep. 1 fits in perfectly with the other movies. It is the introductory chapter of a larger story.    One day I will watch all the movies, 1 - 6, and marvel at the characters and the story that I've come to know and love.",Null,0,0,9 March 2001
