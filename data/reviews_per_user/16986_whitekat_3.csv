Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Jeez...
","Umm... no...This movie TOTALLY sucked. I was VERY dissapointed.What happened??? I think they forgot how they made the other SW movies. This one had too much of a Disney touch. (Ohh noo!!! don't tell me LucasFilm has a deal with Disney TOO?? AAHHH!!! Disney is going to take over the world for christ's sake!!!)Anyway, the whole JarJar Binks thing was mostly what screwed it up for me. Too stupid. Chewbacca wasn't like that!!! He was much more dignified.Anyway, a lot of people thought it was really good, well good for them. If you enjoyed this, you might also enjoy a few other movies as well:1. Bambi 2. The Little Mermaid 3. Baby Geniuses 4. Hercules 5. Antz 6. George of the Jungle 7. Sphere
I just PRAY they at least TRY to make a decent movie with episode II. Maybe they'll come to their senses and not try to insult our intelligence with a mass of stupidity and disney-like crap.",Null,0,1,22 June 1999
Back to the Future Part III," Da Best
",I think that Back to the Future III was the BEST of the trilogy. It explores more of the Characters' personalities and souls. You have to watch the first two in order first though. It just sucks if you don't watch the whole thing in order.,Null,0,0,29 December 1998
The Truman Show," THE BEST MOVIE OF ALL TIME!!!
","I've seen a lot of movies, but this movie was THE BEST of all I've seen. DEFINITELY better that Titanic (YUK). It has everything. Comedy, action, great acting, (I think it was Jim Carrey's best) and just an overall great story. I think that it was a very good idea for a movie and they did it up very well. Anyway, that's my opinion. DA BEST!!!",Null,0,0,29 December 1998
