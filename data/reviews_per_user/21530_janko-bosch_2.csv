Blade Runner 2049," A Sci-fi masterpiece
","From the first opening boom till the last moment this film looks stunning and just puts you in a grim, depressing and nasty world. Visually it looks stunning and the soundtrack is really helping the mood of this film.I always felt one of the most important themes of the first movie was love and love not knowing boundaries. I think this movie is about compassion and humane treatment. Rare themes these days in blockbuster movies.Sci-fi movies like this are rare. No predictable action sci-fi plot here. Blade Runner 2049 is a great sci-fi novel in a movie format. Some people have complains about the length of the film. This is one of those films where every scene just has to be there with a pace that fits the film perfectly. I watched it twice and both times I just lost sense of time.",10,3,10,13 October 2017

The villain was not impressive in any way, the climax didn't work, the humor wasn't there. And the underminer still roams freely at the end of the movie....",5,7,19,7 July 2018
