Lucky Number Slevin," Good acting
","Wnated to say that Morgan Freemans and Josh Hartnetts acting was terrific, and the dialog was superb. Clatchy and seriously at a innocent way. The way the express themselves, criticize the current language system. you gotta to give the them a hand. More from where that came from! The story itself has twists, the dialog itself has twists, and you can't really find anything that is disturbing you except the fact that you liked the movie, even though you didn't catch it from the beginning. But lighten up sunshine cause the movie will grow all the way from the beginning till the end. Should warn you though, the movie is best appreciated when it's being watched with good concentration, not the 'friday-night-wanna-have-a-film-to-sleep-to'.",10,4,7,6 November 2006
