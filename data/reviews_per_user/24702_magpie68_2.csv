The Blair Witch Project," Watch films with an open mind and you may enjoy more of them. (SPOILER)
","I think perhaps the hype surrounding this film turned some people off, and gave yet more false expectations of what they were going to see.I watched it and was scared. My sister was terrified. Even though I had explained to her before it started that it wasn't really the footage shot by the dead kids. BUT when you watch movies you suspend disbelief for an hour or two anyway, so why not get into it with the characters and be there with them... then you get the point and you will be scared. Isn't that the whole point of watching movies? Identifying with the protagonists and sharing their lives for a few hours?I have to say that Heather was the most annoying young woman I would ever hope to avoid, but that's the point! I identified with Josh when they argued and blessed Mike when we heard he threw the map in the ravine. YAY. Uh-Uh......I think the label 'Horror' that was attached to this film was a little too strong and perhaps this label has provoked some of the comments you can read above - but let's not forget that to truly enjoy a film you have to lose your immediate reality and be there for a moment or two. If you can do this then this film will thrill you.",7,0,1,2 June 2000
Eyes Wide Shut," Kubrick never did dialogue too well
","Never use 10 words where 200 will do, that seems to be the late great Mr. Kubrick's take on dialogue. What could have been a great film was spoiled by many moments when we - as viewers - had GOT THE POINT ALREADY but Nicole and Tom talked on. I thought the scene where Alice was stoned and talking about her dream was NEVER GOING TO END. Sorry for shouting but I see that this film has 25% of people rating it 10. That's not good, the film is flawed in so may ways (the sex isn't even arousing for instance, and when William breaks down and cries after finding the mask on the pillow you just wish he would grow up) that it's not worth a 10, or even 5, I wished I'd not wasted 2 1/2 hours of my life on this durn rubbish. Oh sorry, occasionally nice cinematography. That's it.",1,2,5,2 June 2000
