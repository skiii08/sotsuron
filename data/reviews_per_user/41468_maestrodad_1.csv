3:10 to Yuma," Typical Hollywood western--this might be a spoiler
","This film doesn't deserve the hype. The promotional materials compared it to 'Unforgiven.' That it fell short of that high standard is certainly understandable and doesn't diminish the film. But in comparing this film to Eastwood's, the studio sets the viewer up for a similarly thoughtful, anti-romantic experience. Which is to say, it sets the viewer up for disappointment. 'Unforgiven' detonates the many myths of the western, while '3:10' incorporates almost every one. It's also contains many unbelievable moments.There is a ruthless villain who has killed hundreds of men to take money and escape the law. Yet, after committing a brutal murder, he inexplicably leaves alive a few witnesses to make life difficult for himself. He's very clever and resourceful, but he fairly walks into custody. Thereafter, he attempts escape but also helps his captors. His gang can shoot anything that moves, except when the plot demands otherwise. His captors are inept and cowardly. The good guy is similarly iconic--a simple but moral everyman, misunderstood, resented, and surrounded by corruption. There are instant recoveries from gunshots and beatings. There's dynamite and a Gatling gun. And you can pretty much guess who's going to die in what order. The ending attempts some bogus moral statement and comes off as completely unbelievable.If you haven't yet seen '3:10 to Yuma,' forget 'Unforgiven' and any presumption of believability--you might have a chance of enjoying it.",5,1,5,16 March 2008
