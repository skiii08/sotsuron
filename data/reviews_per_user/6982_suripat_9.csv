First Man," Depressing, sad and dark tale of a man
","I felt compelled to write a review due to the heavy load this movie was. Throug the director and writer eyes this is not a space movie but a depressing drag through one dark man emotions. He is sad, distant from his family and kids and attached to his daughter. That is all. You won't feel anything good watching this.",4,1,2,25 November 2018
Knives Out," Murder who done it just the right old fashioned way 10/10
",Excellent movie. Daniel Craig is priceless in his role. Just the right amount of comedy and a joy to watch! A truly Agatha Christie tribute. Go watch it!,10,4,11,29 December 2019
The Irishman," Millenials and DC/Marvel lovers: get away
","Excellent movie, actor work and direction. A joy to watch and so great that it is a LONG movie. If you're over 30 and can understand mob stories, aside from Marvel CGI clichés, go watch it. Otherwise just download an Audio Book 'because paper books are boring and so lenghty to read'.",9,4,7,1 December 2019
Yesterday," Excellent entertainment, acting and scripting!
","This was one heck of a cool movie, turned out unexpectedly good. Fun and tense moments along with a sprinkle of nice comedy and clever scripting makes this a joy to watch. Himesh and Lily play such a lovely couple! Go for it, even if you are not a Beatles fan!",10,0,2,12 September 2019
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Another masterpiece by our beloved Tarantino!
","The movie starts slowly...small pieces of information that, at first, make you wonder 'why is this here?' until later in the trama where everything gets connected and you are responsible for drawing the line between the dots, amazing Tarantino scripting, as usually! With right doses of music and a lovely retro atmosphere. Just reserve a calm day in your life and watch it! Don't forget to admire some lovely feet on the way, and other not so much, but hey, it's one of his signatures!",9,1,4,24 November 2019
Pitch Perfect 2," Don't waste your time
","If you are into American dorm movies and have less than 20 years old you might like this. Terrible clichés you have seen it all since the 1980s and I definitely can't understand why this Acapella is a thing anyway: music without weight, without punch, without the band. Go see something else.",1,0,1,14 October 2019
Pitch Perfect 3," Same old, just watch something else

Da 5 Bloods," A Spike Lee movie. One that I don't like it.
","Trademark Spike's line of movies. A War movie. But despite all the artistic creativity, performances and cinematography, it seems disjointed many times and difficult to watch. Love it or hate it. I chose the latter. 5 for all the effort.",5,68,129,12 June 2020
