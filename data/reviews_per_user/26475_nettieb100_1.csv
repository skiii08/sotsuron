The Legend of Bagger Vance," Bagger Vance was under-rated
","This is not only a visually beautiful movie, it is a spiritually beautiful movie. It's one of those movies that when I see it is on I will select it. I've seen it or parts of it maybe 50 times. It is so uplifting. I don't know if it is because I love golf, but the moments that Redford captures in this movie are so beautifully done. He manages to keep the feel of the book without adding all of the nonsense from the book. I love this movie. The casting was perfect, and his sureness with the camera all add up to a movie that leaves me feeling better every time I see it. I love when I come upon the movie just before the hole in one scene and when Bagger talks Junuh into the shot out of the woods. I get goose bumps every time. This movie ranks high on my goose bump rating. Sometimes I see a performance or an entire movie that just gives me goose bumps, like Gladiator, or The Departed or Blood Diamond or Crash and I know there is true greatness happening. This movie is really under rated and I wish I could just say to Redford thank you for making this movie.",10,4,7,5 October 2008
