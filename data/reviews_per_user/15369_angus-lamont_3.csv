It," Great adaptation but not terrifying
","Just been to the midnight showing, which was great! Just before I give my thoughts, it is worth pointing out that I am only a quarter of the way through the book, which I was aiming to finish before seeing this ðŸ˜• I have also yet to watch the 90's TV version (which I was to watch after finishing the book), so I can't really draw any comparisons. From the initial reviews, I was expecting to be seeing a terrifying film, which 'It' is - if you have a clown phobia. Unfortunately I don't so it wasn't as scary as I expected, but definitely creepy and suspenseful in some parts. Another point that the reviews brought up was that the film was low on the jump-scares which isn't true really as most of the scares seemed to be generated in this way. Also some effects sequences looked a little fake, particularly when Pennywise is moving about, which seems to using CG (quite pointless if you ask me). Onto some positive points. For a film rated 15 though, this film does have a fair amount of blood/gore which I found quite surprising. The cast are great and provide some great drama (as well as some laughs) to the story. The actor playing Pennywise is great, and it'd be interesting to compare with Tim Curry's approach. The film overall was beautifully shot, with great set pieces and a score that fits the tone of the film. However it did seem to go on longer than expected - I honestly thought I'd been sitting for 3 hours (the run time is 2hrs, 15mins). That said, at no point did I ever lose interest in what was happening. Not really a spoiler, but this is the first of two chapters so the ending is really a cliffhanger of sorts, which I was expecting and I do look forward to viewing the next film. Overall the moral of the story here is not to get caught up in the hype of a film. I think people want to be scared by this film, which is fine, it just didn't deliver what was being said in the initial reviews. I'll give it an 8/10 for just now, as it may change after I've finished the book.",9,6,14,8 September 2017
Psycho," Possibly the best film ever made! No Spoilers.
","I remember the first time watching this film (as I write this I am listening to Bernard Herrmanns wonderful score for the film), best Saturday night movie ever! Lights all turned off to add to the suspense. Its one of those films you can only really see once, but I have watched it more than 10 times! I think that the music for this film is amazing, from the opening credits to the infamous 'Shower Scene'. Obviously I would say it was Hitchcock's best (as a lot of people would agree) and the casting choice is brilliant, unlike the 1998 'disasterpiece' with Vince Vaugh as Norman Bates(seriously?!). Anthony Perkins has got to be one of the greatest movie villains ever! I cannot recommend this film enough! It is just a masterpiece of cinema and every single person on this planet should see it!P.S. Make sure it is the 1960 version you watch and NOT the 1998 remake!",10,1,2,2 June 2013
The Woman in Black," Will be remembered forever!
","I went to see this film with my friends. To start the Hammer logo fills the screen with numerous posters from their classic horror films. This really delighted me. The film provided many, sometimes unintentional jump scares, the whole audience screaming at the sudden burst of a tap, spewing out mud. There are many creepy scenes in which the camera is focused on Radcliffe but there isn't much going on which adds to the mystery of, is the Woman In Black in the shot and we do get that feeling to look for her, especially in the long shots. One question I have to ask is why the film was rated 12A, I mean seriously an 8 year old may die watching this film, they will never sleep again! OK it is not that scary, but still. The weakest part for me was the ending though. WHY WHY WHY did they want to do that. SPOILER SPOILER SPOILERThe ending involves killing Radcliffe and his sonSPOILER OVEROverall I wood give this a HIT, definitely. Go see it and you will not come out disappointed.",10,0,2,15 February 2012
