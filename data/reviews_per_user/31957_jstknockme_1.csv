Iron Man 3," Iron Man ruined Fox Kids for me
","I am still a young man who grew up watching IRON MAN,Spider Man on fox Kids and specially iron man used to be my favorite super hero and Mandarin the super powerful evil villain, so thats y i was so eager to watch this Movie right from last year when i watched the trailer and boy was I disappointed?Black has ridiculed each and every person and character associated with the IRON MAN-3. I still don't get it, just to please some kids section of audience or make it more family friendly u try to ruin one of the most vicious characters and make him a point of comedy so that u can get some more money from the kids section. Even Iron Man-2 seems much better to me. And the funny dialogs are not so funny anymore after i saw that idiotic twist in the second half.Pardon me for my English but seriously really disappointed seeing such a wonderful characters being made a laughing point just for the sake of good reviews or money.",1,3,8,8 May 2013
