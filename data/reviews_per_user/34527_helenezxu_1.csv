Black Swan," No words can describe
","I remember we waited for this movie. The 1st opening night in NYC tri-state area, we couldn't find any theater to see it in NJ. I still wonder why. Only 3 theaters in NYC was playing so we planned our night, hired a babysitter, drove in, spent a night out just for this movie. And the tickets were SOLD OUT. We were so disappointed, and dared to think and try the never-done-before... bought tickets for another movie and tried to sneak in. But we failed badly cause so many people were trying to do the same. They have two staffs guarded the entrance just for this movie. The night was wasted.But we didn't give up. We waited a week and arranged our time carefully. Just before taking the fly to our vacation, we dared to risk missing the fly and spared a few hours from our precious day, jump into the PATH, headed to NYC again.And... it was WORTH IT!!! With all the effort, I've seen the most amazing film of the years. It was bold, daring and truly original. It played the traditional 'Swan Lake' upside down! Adding so much spicy and excitement on the plain and simple classical Swan Lake. It's a thriller you don't expect... and definitely one of its kind. A true masterpiece... from the way the story was planned, told, unfolded; from the play of the characters (Natalie Portman, the most talented young female actress today, is on her way to become a legend); from mind game it plays on Nina and you. The story is simple and straight forward. Nonetheless, it's simply the best!",10,2,4,13 January 2011
