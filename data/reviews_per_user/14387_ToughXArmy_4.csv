Vertigo," Superb Kim Novak in Film Masterpiece
","Alfred Hitchcock directed an amazing masterpiece Vertigo a film so great one sees new elements every time I see this gorgeous movie.James Stewart is perfection but the real shout out goes to Kim Novak then the #1 Female star in the world on loan from her studio Columbia. I mention this because Novak at Columbia was showcased and at Paramount where this film was shot Kim was unprotected and vulnerable. Also Hitch's often comment he meant to cast Vera Miles was again something to get under Ms. Novak's skin. There is no way #1 Box Office Star Kim Novak was preferable to the lovely Vera Miles. Kim Novak was surely the bigger star and Kim Novak's performance in Vertigo to me is what makes this film work.Bernard Herrman's music is memorable and the entire production deserve our most respectful applause.Bravo Hitchcock, Novak, Stewart, Herrman.",10,3,6,24 March 2013
Lawrence of Arabia," The Greatest Movie Of All Time
","Magnificent Film.Producer Sam Spiegel and Director David Lean made movie history with The Bridge On The River Kwai reunited to film Lawrence of Arabia, in my estimation the finest film ever made.Sam Spiegel operated his Horizon Films out of London with an great record such as On The Waterfront, The Bridge On The River Kwai, and Suddenly Last Summer. Stars in Spiegel films were such as Elizabeth Taylor, Marlon Brando, Katharine Hepburn, Alec Guiness, William Holden, etc. David Lean was a great Director with such films such as Brief Encounter and The Bridge On The River Kwai.Peter O Toole is magnificent as Lawrence, as is Anthony Quinn, Jack Hawkins, and Omar Sharif.Maurice Jarre deserves great credit for the memorable film score",10,4,8,27 January 2013
Patton," Great Scott!
","George C Scott dominates this film in a memorable portrayal of US General Patton. Once in a lifetime can an actor get such an opportunity. Mr. Scott brings General Patton to life in a bravura performance.FrankliN Schaffner was a fine Director and he guises the film brilliantly but it is George C Scott who gives one of the greatest male performances I have ever seen. As we all know, Mr. Scott refused the Oscar for which he so richly earned.A fine supporting cast in this 20th Century Fox film which was a smash hit.",9,7,8,22 May 2013
Lincoln," Daniel Day Lewis is Lincoln
",Daniel Day Lewis becomes President Abraham Lincoln in this fine film created by Steven Spielberg. Note that not even Spielberg's firm Dreamworks was solo on this production but also financed via 20th Century Fox and Disney! The film is serious reflection on President Lincoln and the production design commands praise. My only hesistton of this film is the performance of Sally Field who is 30 years older than Mary Todd Lincoln. Ms. Field brings her fine acting skills to the movie just that the age difference is jarring. Who else could Spielberg have cast? Daniel Day Lewis richly deserved the Oscar for this performanceSpieldbeg creates a lasting film classic with this fine film. But it is Day Lewis who will be remembere for bringing Abraham Lincoln to life.Roger Mantee,7,2,4,16 March 2013
