Skyfall," Someone is trying to ruin he Bond legacy - plot holes; cheesy lines; boring; terrible acting
","1- intro scene with stupid played out chase scene. Bond in bull dozer right in front of a world class assassin... assassin misses 2- terrible black girl agent doesn't listen to M until the very end when she has a terrible shot... she's an agent and freezes when she hits bond instead of taking out the target 3- Komodo dragon pit? really? then the dude just points the gun at bond and waits for him to look at him... did no one else have guns and could no one just peer over the edge and shoot bond? 4-black agent girl can't act and is ugly. What is with Hollywood casting ugly untalented girls in big roles (ex- batman) 5- terrible flirting scene with bond.6- end shootout scene is so boring, played out, and dumb. Just have a bunch of dudes walk up to the house? oh wow.7- bond falls in ice water so the bad guy just walks off? he had plenty of time to wait for him to pop up and just shoot him 8- bad guy wants to have a single bullet take him + M out? how much worse can this get. Seems like they just ran out of material.9- old man in house. Terrible acting and lame/boring storyline.10- hardly played any of the classic music. If you want to make another type of movie, go do that, just don't have it involve James Bond.",3,6,14,17 February 2013
