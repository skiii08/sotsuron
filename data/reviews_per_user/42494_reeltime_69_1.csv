"Run, Fat Boy, Run"," This is worth a watch, no really it is......
","I loved this film from start to finish!!! The story, the cast, the acting, the directing all of these things are bang - on hats off to David Schwimmer i say !! This is isn't exactly the most intellectual storyline and it isn't going to change your life, but it is very entertaining Pegg at his best offering some of the funniest lines and on screen hilarity iv'e seen in a while. Plus Dylan Moran is excellent and usually i find that Stand-Up Comedians don't carry into films very well but this didn't seem a problem for Moran.the film is also riddled with cameo's from famous British Comedians! That really put the cherry on top of of this film.If you want to see and honest comedy with a very heartfelt and original script Run,Fatboy,Run is for you!!!",8,65,88,7 September 2007
