Ghost," [9.5] A wonder full of sweet and bitter romance
","Ghost is a superb movie and almost a gem in its own genre, where the screenplay, story, actors deliver in such a fantastic and emotional way that it takes you to a wonderful trip, from which you come out teary, joyful and heartbroken at the same time.Patrick Swayze, Demi Moore and Whoopi Goldberg all deserved nominations, awards and Oscars for their performances.I will keep this review short in honor of this movie and because only watching and appreciating it do it justice.RIP Patrick. It was an honor getting to know your powerful acting.
You will always shine bright.",10,1,1,29 January 2020
The Bodyguard," Oh my goodness!
","There was a time when there were no internet for me, no video and no satellite.
I was a 19 y.o. boy, young and full of emotions. A naive young fellow knowing nothing about life and its twists.
One day, while waiting at a bus station, I overheard two friends talking about a movie called 'The Bodyguard' and that how good that was, how they enjoyed it and how Withney Houston shone in it.
Years passed, I lived my life, but I always had memory of that conversation in the back of my mind as if waiting for the right moment and opportunity to grab and watch that film.
And opportunity it came one day with its video from a friend. I put the cassette in the player and started watching the anticipated movie with unbelievable excitement and happiness.And the movie rolled over me like an avalanche...That was a rollercoaster of emotions, chemistry, love, acting, music and one of the best and unique voices of the 20th century that I experienced.That was one of the most beautiful and heartwarming movies that I have ever had the pleasure to watch.Kevin Costner and Withney Houston were just diamond-like in it and outshone themselves in every aspect.Tears are appearing in the corners of my eyes as I am writing this review. This is a review full of memories of my youth as well as the rainbow of true emotions that were conveyed by the eternally alive comet called The Bodyguard.Withney, I've always loved you. No other singer has ever been like you and never will be.
You had one of the most beautiful, powerful and mind-blowing voice of all time. All you needed was a microphone and the audience was in awe.
We will always love you and cherish your dear memory.RIP",10,0,0,4 February 2020
LÃ©on: The Professional," Thrilling and emotional
","Leon, thanks to Luc Besson's superb story, screenplay & directing and Jean Reno's wonderful & intense acting is a different film and a rare cinematographic experience to enjoy to its fullest.It has a different vibe and feel, mostly and foremost due to the captivating story, its development and the awesome acting by the main actors and the supporting cast.Usually, films like Leon are already on such a high level and so captivating that in all honesty, any review might seem dull, unnecessary or out of place.The movie speaks for itself and in my opinion, the best Besson's movie after Le Grand Bleu.",10,1,2,1 April 2020
Avengers: Endgame," Above average...
","Without a doubt, that's a movie which visuals are stunning as always. That does not disappoint.
My main concerns are with the story, some unbelievable situations and battles. The results are not always what you expect, which IMO lowers the rating.It would be a better movie, if the seriousness of situations was increased throughout and the whole current of the movie was based on more active, wild and shocking battles.",7,3,7,7 January 2020
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," [9.2] A Q.T. work that I enjoyed very much
","Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood is a fine piece of fiction which depicts three parallel stories, intertwined with various degrees of strength and closeness.<ul><li>Is it entertaining? Yes, 100%</li><li>Is it boring? Absolutely not</li><li>Who will love it? Those who can sit in place and enjoy unfolding of a fictional yet very entertaining story</li><li>Who will hate it? Those who are too hyper to sit in place, to properly relax and more often than not (only) enjoy mind-numbing, (shallow) non-stop action sequences all over the place</li></ul><ul><li>The acting is great by all of the famous cast, as one can expect. Brad Pitt showing again his strong charisma, strength and wonderful acting. Leonardo DiCaprio playing an interesting role, a fading character, all performed easily by his flowing talent. Margot Robbie showing shining beauty, 'swimming' flawlessly in her environment while turning head after head and making people have amnesia as long as they watch her.</li><li>The dog was wonderful, loved his very intelligent behavior completed with frightening brute force</li></ul>On a side note, IMO, the Bruce Lee sequence was a shame and unnecessary, belittling the legend who wasn't there to beat the crap out of Him, in a real and friendly way!That's a movie that doesn't need advertising and is a force by himself. Watch it and hopefully enjoy!",9,18,24,23 May 2020
1917," A tale of heroism
","Movies like '1917' , in all honesty, don't need special treatments and reviews as they speak for themselves, especially, if not recounted by real experiences of combat veterans, making their reviews even more intense and filled with truthful realism.This is a movie, simply told, having a simple but touching story showing the basic horrors of WWI, complete with amazing cinematography, up to the point accompanying music and very good acting from the cast.It is not paced with action packed scenes in its true active form, but keeping showing the visceral emotions that the protagonists and soldiers were experiencing in that period, specifically on 6 April 1917 as they see themselves present and awake in their surrounding minute by minute.It is an homage among countless others to those brave soldiers who have experienced those harrowing times and to the miseries of war in general.As such, it deserves praise & recognition and its story doesn't disappoint a bit and beautifully told.",9,0,1,10 April 2020
Midsommar," [1.5] Pointless weak trash
","Midsommar is an intense, debile and psychedelic circus which oscillate between debility, craziness and horrific dementia.
Unfortunately, I had the privilege to watch the 2:28 version and not its director's cut, which is around 24 minutes longer. If I'm lucky, I will remedy to that!What the director seemingly failed to realize was that either you make a full-blown horror or a psychological psychedelic experience. Anything in between and borrowing from either parties is most surely to fail and make some ... people laugh at it as if it was a black comedy.On a side note, it felt like a real experience and I truly hope that THAT don't exist out there for real.",1,8,12,21 May 2020
It Chapter Two," [5.5] Have a good sleep before watching
","It Chapter Two is a jock of a movie and suitable for people aged 16 and less, basically destroying all that its predecessor had achieved.<ul><li>(-) Screenplay and storyline are very weak</li><li>(-) Too heavy relying on CGI, needlessly and badly</li><li>(-) Cheap and badly executed jump scares or total lack of. A true scare comes from the situation, atmosphere and acting, not computer generated imagery</li><li>(-) Slow and boring development and flow of the movie</li><li>(-) 2h 49min for such a movie! 1h too much</li><li>(-) Bad and not credible ending</li><li>(+) Average to good acting by the cast and their chemistry together</li></ul>Therefore, not much recommended and forgettable.
Big budget for near nothing. A movie that was very lucky that it grossed well in the US and worldwide.",6,0,0,3 July 2020
Fifty Shades of Grey," Immerse yourself and do not resist
","Ask yourself why would you wanna watch such a movie in the first place.Curiosity, thrill, romance, erotism, sensuality, sentimentality...Do watch it for its concept.
Do watch it for its acting.
Do watch it for its atmosphere.
Do watch it for its wealth of scenes.
Do watch if you are an appreciative person.
And last but not least, do watch it for Dakota Johnson.Do not if you're not appreciative.
Do not if you're all negativeness.
Do not if you're mindlessly judgy.
Do not if you are all in crappy reviews.
Do not if you're all middle-age-era cells, scents and sensations.Keep in mind that nobody's forcing you!Have decency, respect yourself and other viewers.This is a movie personifying the dreams, emotions and desires of many folks around the world.This is a masterpiece in its own genre and category.",9,1,2,4 February 2020
Midway," [9.6] A wonder of a movie
","Those of us to whom the battles of WWII and cinematic productions made about them are important, will find Midway a must-watch.
Sometimes a production is so well made that wanting to review it seems needless, as the gem speaks for itself; and the title is one of those bright and colorful ones.
Will keep this review short and clear as it deserves so.<ul><li>The screenplay, development, cinematography, filming and CGI/VFX are top-notch.</li><li>The acting is wonderfully believable, strong and terrific at the same time, by both the Americans and Japanese cast. They really shone. My sincere admiration.</li><li>Roland Emmerich once again showed what a dexterous director he is in directing Action/Drama movies.</li><li>The movie succeeds awesomely in packing so much events and scenes in its runtime of 2h 18m. A huge win.</li></ul>And finally, I bow to the 26-year Navy veteran, who wrote one of the best and memorable reviews that I've ever had the pleasure to read. Finding his review not helpful is a big and sad mistake.
Congratulations Sir. I learned a lot from your review.Hopefully, the next time I check the movie's page on IMDb, it will have a lot more than just 836 reviews for such a superb production.",10,0,1,25 June 2020
