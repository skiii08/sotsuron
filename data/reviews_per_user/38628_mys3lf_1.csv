Miracle," Great Movie
","I really liked this movie, it was quite historical to me and helped me learn a lot of what happened before i was born. I would recommend this movie to almost everyone because it is a very moving movie, and i would also recommend this movie to lots of people my age (I'm in high school).This movie was also made very well, I did not find anything that seemed wrong while watching it. Overall, i think that this was a very good movie and hope that you will like it also.The DVD's extra features are also quite interesting and many people will probably like them just as much as i did.They really re-enacted certain events very well, for most of them not being easily re-enactable. Most of the things that happened were probably not re-done all too easily. Thats why I gave this movie a 10/10.",10,1,1,27 September 2004
