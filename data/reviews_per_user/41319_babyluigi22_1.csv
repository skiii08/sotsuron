Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," An enjoyable film, to say the least.
","First off, i'd like to say that the main reason I think people disliked this movie so much is because it had to follow up the original trilogy, and that's like putting the monkees on stage after you've just seen the beatles. You just wanna go home. Compared to the originals, I can see why this was a letdown for most fans. There were a lot of politicians and quiet meetings that were a total snooze-fest, but the only reason we didn't see this in the original trilogy is because the senate no longer exists. If you can get past the politics and Jar-Jar, it's a very good movie. The choreography on the lightsaber battles was incredible, and the battle droids were great. The effects were mind blowing, and the podrace was incredible. It showed us more into the world of star wars, and that's all I could have asked for.",7,7,13,12 September 2009
