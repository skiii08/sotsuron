War Dogs," Absolute nonsense
","If you are expecting a Jonah Hill version of Lord of War (2005), then this is not it.War Dogs is like an energy drink commercial, aimed at thirsty twelve year olds. Plenty of clueless ego swagger, cultural reinforcement that has nothing to do with anything, and a pretty girl who is just a convenient stereotype. The only thing 'true' about this film is that guns exist, and people sell them. What a stinker.One extra star because Jonah's character almost had discernible personality.",2,0,1,15 June 2020
The Irishman," Not interesting.
","At face value, it's like a long version of Forrest Gump, rebuilt as a dark and bitter stage play, with none of the interesting parts.The first hour is so bad, it would've had to have been done like that on purpose, for an effect that isn't clear. None of the characters have any sense of emotion. Sociopaths they may be, but it's like watching a propaganda news reel from 1942. The second hour starts to offer a story, but there's no overall context or background for who is now the lead role, so it becomes Al Pacino enjoying himself yelling at stuff. In the final hour it's as if another movie starts, about a group of tired old gangsters with massive egos dying of old age, but by then no one cares and it's just pointlessly drab.You could watch it out of curiosity, but maybe try watching it in one hour instalments unless you desperately need to fall asleep.",3,1,3,19 June 2020
Nacho Libre," Unmissable Classic
","Nacho Libre is the kind of animated cartoon you'd have seen in the 1970's, if it had been reimagined as real life in 2006. The facial expressions of the characters and photography are exaggerated and romantic, the dialogue is deliberately stilted and absurd, and every kindness is applied to the humour. It's an unmissable Classic.",10,1,1,14 September 2019
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," A Goodbye to All That
","When Pulp Fiction was released, it was as if the natural Heir to Sam Peckinpah's Kingdom had been crowned.I guess we all were expecting things to simply get better, but after Jackie Brown, things took a turn. When you watch the Trailer for Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, you'll think, 'Yeah Ok Hateful Eight was too too far, but this honesty looks like a return to the Pulp days...'. Sadly, it isn't. I mean, it is, for the first 3/4 of the film, but it retains a beat down tone, going nowhere with the material. And then the most unbelievable brain fart begins.I never imagined that Tarantino would pen a nostalgic, not quite completely edited, love letter to the Boomer Generation: not the Boomers who fought in Vietnam or in civil rights movements, but those who remained at home and who felt threatened by the dramatic cultural events around them, rather than inspired or enlightened.I honestly don't know what to make of it, except to say it wasn't a satisfying watch. You should probably watch it as a curiosity, but not as a great moment in film making.",5,1,1,4 April 2020
American Made," Yep, that's Tom Cruise alright.
","During the first hour after watching this film, I seriously questioned my life and where it was going. Should I just have studied harder at school, become a top pilot, drug smuggler, a CIA operative and one of Pablo Escobar's crew, or is that just how the ideal American would like my life to have ideally been? It was dizzying. Well, those doors are closed to me now.I guess the moral of this story is don't give the bird to the guy who just gave you a million bucks as you climb into your Ford Pinto, especially if you're too young to be retiring on your yacht in two weeks.As far as Tom Cruise films go, yeah, it was Tom Cruise. He was the same guy as always, just squashed onto a different background. He's been imprinted onto better stories - Collateral - for example. American Made is just a montage of things teenagers thought would be a cool lifestyle, back in 1997.",3,0,3,12 June 2019
