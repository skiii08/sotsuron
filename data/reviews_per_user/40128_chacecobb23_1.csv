The Legend of Bagger Vance," Enjoyable if you know what to look for
","What a great movie.  Robert Redford did a fantastic job.  His direction of a superb cast made the film a truly fulfilling experience.  Smith's job as the mentor of a young golfer proved effective and touching.  What many people (namely sports fans) fail to realize is that this movie is not all about golf.  This is a movie about your ability to overcome an obstacle when the cards are stacked against you.  This is a movie about finding yourself when you thought you couldn't.  This is a movie about life and what it takes to be happy with yourself.  While the movie is predictable at times, you can't help but feel good watching it.  I recommend it to anyone who loves life and everything to do with it.",Null,0,1,5 March 2002
