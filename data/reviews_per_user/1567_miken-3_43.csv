Saturday Night Fever," A Classic
","This is the ultimate gang movie taken to a new height, that being a dance club or discoteque as the clubs were called in the 70's and 80's. John Travolta was a young actor with a lot of energy, gives a performance of high caliber as as likable street tough (Tony Manero) who works in a paint store by day and goes with his buddies to the 2001 Oddessy club in Brooklyn at night where he transforms into the ultimate club dancer.One night he meets Stephanie, an older woman who tries to make Tony 'grow up' and train to compete with her in an upcoming dance contest. Along the way Tony has to deal with his deadbeat father, his mother who only loves his priest brother, his brother who needs to quit the priesthood and find himself, Annette who is Tony's ultimate 'groupie,' and Tony's friends who seem to be getting into scrapes with a rival gang.The movie is full of memorable lines and the clothes that Tony wore, especially the white suit, caused a fashion revolution.Probably the be movie for getting a feel for life in the late 70's.",9,0,1,27 January 2005
Ghost," Great!!!
","This is one of my top 50 favorite movies. Everybody is great in it from Patrick Swayze, Demi Moore to Whoppi Goldberg. Even the two villains were excellent though I heard that the actor who played Willie Lopez actually passed away not long after making the film.Sam Wheat a banker, is murdered during a mugging while coming from a show with his girlfriend Mollie. For some reason Wheat is still walking the Earth, now in ghost form. He follows Mollie and finds that the killer was really after a password that he had to authorize funds transfers through the bank. Now Mollie is also in danger from the killers and Sam feels helpless.Sam then happens upon Goldberg, who is running a scam as a medium who can communicate with the dead. Apparently, Goldberg can hear Sam talk so Sam uses Goldberg to try to communicate with Mollie and warn her of danger.Sam then realizes that the only way to protect Mollie is to be able to use some sort of physical force. The only problem is as a ghost he has no physical substance so he cannot touch anything. Or can he? Sam learns that maybe he can touch objects when he encounters another ghost who is able to do just that. The other ghost turns out to be one of the most entertaining characters of the film.The movie has it all from a love story, to excellent comedy, fairly decent special effects and a great story.",10,5,7,6 February 2005
Unbreakable," I expected it to be better!
","With all the hype to this movie, I thought it was going to be a top-notch thriller. Instead I found a slow-paced movie that I kept waiting for something occur. Bruce Willis gives one of his sleepiest performances as a security guard, who has unbreakable bones and seems to be able to sense bad people.Samuel L. Jackson is the opposite in that he was born with incredibly weak bones and goes through life constantly in and out of hospitals with fractures. His one solace in life is comic books. Jackson is obsessed with finding his opposite and he does this by looking for survivors of disasters. He seeks out Willis, who is the sole survivor of a train wreck. We later find out that Willis has never been sick and he may have survived some other disasters as well.You keep expecting Jackson to ask Willis for a bone marrow transplant or some other type operation to strengthen his bones but Jackson's motives are inspired by the comic books that hold his fascination.The director seemed to miss some opportunities in the movie. We have a scene at the beginning, where Willis tries to pick-up his female seat mate on the train and then after the train wrecks, we know that she is dead so you later expect something more out of Willis and his feelings.Jackson also comes off as a loony throughout the film and you wonder why Willis ever talks to him at all.There is one brilliant scene, where Jackson is trying to sell a comic art print to a man and goes through the whole history behind the print. At the end of Jackson's passionate rendition, the man says he will take the print to give to his 4-year-old son (who obviously would have no sense as to the value of the print). This infuriates Jackson enough to throw the man out of his store without selling him the print.",7,0,1,24 January 2005
Fight Club," An instant cult classic!
","Interesting tale of what happens when white collar worker get bored. With nothing better to do, two guys have a fight and it draws a crowd. This seems to start a new fad where accountants/lawyers/stockbroker types get together and watch two of them go at it. Eventually, guys are showing up to work all bruised and there seems to a knowing when one sees the other. As the movie progresses, we are not sure what is real and what is in the mind of one of the main characters.There have been other movies that seem to depict fights in back rooms and garages (Jean Claude Van Damme did Lionheart). This movie is definitely the best of the bunch.",9,4,9,24 January 2005
Spider-Man 2," The best superhero film ever!
","Sam Rami needs to be congratulated on making a film that totally outdoes its predecessor. Tobey McGuire is great and is one of the most likable characters (re: Peter Parker) that I have seen in a film in a long time. Alfred Molina is great as one of the more charismatic villains that have ever been portrayed on the screen. I found myself cheering several times throughout the movie.Peter Parker can't seem to hold a job (he's killing a pizza business that promises on-time delivery or it's free), his grades are stumbling (his extra-curricular activities as Spiderman keep him from being prepared for Dr. Connors class) and he keeps disappointing the woman he loves (he can't even show up to her Broadway performance). He lives in a squalid one-room apartment and the landlord is constantly screaming at him for his rent while the landlord's daughter keeps staring longingly at him. Everything comes to a head when Mary Jane announces that she is getting married to J. Jonah Jameson's son.Peter starts blaming Spiderman for all his woes and as a result his powers seem to slowly ebb from him. He makes a decision to go against the promise he made to his dead Uncle Ben and decides to toss out his Spiderman suit and try to lead a normal life.He seems to be doing better in school and during a very hilarious sequence he struts around to the tune of Raindrops Keep Falling on My Head (reminiscent of a famous old movie).Meanwhile, Dr. Octavius has been turned into a supervillain (thanks to some computer controlled mechanical arms that have attached themselves to him and taken over his mind because of an accident during a scientific experiment). Octavius, now Dr. Octopus, is on a crime wave to get the materials he needs to crate a nuclear reactor that could wipe out the city.A heart-to-heart talk with Aunt May and an attack by Dr. Octopus on the woman he loves, makes Peter realize that he must honor his motto (with great power, comes great responsibility) and become Spiderman once more.",10,1,3,24 January 2005
That Thing You Do!," Excellent!
","Tom Hanks gives another brilliant performance, this time as a band manager for a fictional record company.A group of small town teens from Erie Pennsylvania have an amazing sound and a catchy song that gets Hanks attention. He weans them along slowly while the lead singer thinks it is too slow. As their popularity grows (and they take the name The Wonders), the lead singer's patience wanes and he feels too big for his girlfriend (Liv Tyler), who has stood by him through the band's struggles to get to the top. As he pushes her away, she drifts more towards the band's drummer, who seems to be the most caring of the group.The movie has an amazing scene where the drummer goes to a 'jazz' club and meets his all time idol, who turns out to be a regular guy and not the prima donna that the Wonders' lead singer is.Though the groups and the songs were made for the movie, they all sound like they could have been made in the 60's and would have been definite hits! I am surprised that this movie was not a mega-hit because it is really that good.",9,0,0,27 January 2005
Troy," Excellent!
","If you liked the recent King Arthur or the Lord of the Rings movies, you should like this one. Everything about it was excellent from the cinematography, to the acting, with excellent action. The battle between Hector and Achilles is epic. Peter O'Toole is excellent, in probably his best role in years.The makers took great liberties changing the story around from the myth with great success. Having known about the Trojan horse and how everything was going to work out in the end did kind of spoil it a little but not enough to take away one of the 9 stars.Brad Pitt is excellent as Achilles!",9,2,4,26 February 2005
The Terminator," Possible the Best Action/Sci Flick of all time!
","I remember going to this movie thinking it would put me to sleep. After all, back then Arnold was just a muscle guy who had made Pumping Iron and then the not too good, Conan the Barbarian. Boy was I wrong! This movie hooked me from the opening scene and even Arnold's stiff sounding dialogue was perfect for the cyborg he was playing! The chase scenes and narrow escapes had my heart pounding throughout the film! There were many scenes in this film that were firsts for movies such as Arnold removing a damaged robotic eyeball, seeing how the robot mind decided on what dialogue to say and having a robot disguise their voice to sound exactly like a dead human! The other Terminator films may have had the computer enhanced special effects, but they could not match the storyline of this action/SciFi classic that is probably the best all time of its genre!",10,0,2,27 January 2005
The Grapes of Wrath," A powerful movie!
","Good adaptation of Steinbeck's superb novel. The Joad family were farmers in Oklahoma (referred to as Okies) during the 'Dust Bowl' years when drought caused a lot of farmers to lose everything.There are promised work in California and pack up their dilapidated truck with their family including the grandmother (I wonder if the idea for The Beverly Hillbillies came from this) and have a grueling trip there. When they arrive they are treated like 'slaves,' not even paid enough to buy food.This was probably Fonda's best role as the noble Tom Joad. John Carridine is also excellent in a supporting role.This film is historical and an important statement on how corruption lead to the formation of unions and workers rights!",9,4,8,26 January 2005
Predator," A most dangerous game!
","Arnold in an updated version of Most Dangerous Game against an alien hunter who can be invisible, has a force field, has heat sensors, and super advanced weaponry. This is one of the most memorable aliens in the history of cinema. Arnold's group of elite soldiers (they appear to be Rangers) are sent on a rescue mission in a South American jungle. It turns out there are more than just bad guys there. There is also, the above mentioned alien who loves to hunt them down one by one and take something from the victim as a trophy.There are some memorable lines, especially what Arnold says to the alien after he sees what he looks like under his body armor. Arnold does seem to take more punishment than appears to be humanly possible and survive. If you can get by that, you will highly enjoy this film. Definitely worth owning!",8,0,1,24 January 2005
American Pie," One of the Better Teen Flicks
",This was one of the best teen flicks I have seen since Fast Times at Ridgemont High.  Eugene Levy is hilarious as the nerdy horny father who is always helping his son.But I guess I won't be sending any of my kids to 'band camp.',Null,0,0,10 January 2000
The Village," I liked it!
","I know that this movie has a lot of bad reviews because many people did not like the ending. But I did. Though I kind of figured out some of it the first time a creature makes its appearance, I had no problem with it.The acting is first-rate! The movie seems to flow very well. It never seemed to get boring. There is some nice comic relief such as when a group of youths play 'chicken' against the creatures by going into the woods and seeing how long they can try to attract the creatures before chickening out.I recently read Running Out of Time by Margaret Peterson Haddix and thought that the director might have been influenced by that book!",8,0,1,24 January 2005
Van Helsing," Fun and fast paced!
","This movie has amazing special effects and borrows from a lot of the action movie directing that is currently in vogue. Jackman is very likable as a monster hunter hired by the church to eliminate all supernatural creatures and some man-made (Mr. Hyde, Frankenstein's monster).After disposing of a giant Mr. Hyde in London, Jackman is sent to Transylvania to battle the evil Count Dracula. There he meets up with a beautiful vampire slayer who is also after Dracula for turning her brother into a werewolf. However, she is reluctant to go after him because the townspeople are content to keep status quo with Dracula. Dracula and his vampire wives periodically feed on the townsfolk to satisfy their urges as long as the townsfolk don't hunt them. Any actions by the townsfolk against the vampires would result in terrible retribution.Van Helsing battles Dracula's wives who swoop and dart through the air around the town while Van Helsing is shooting a 'machine gun' type bow and arrow. The special effects of these scenes are amazing.Later, Van Helsing does battle with Dracula with the help of a werewolf and the Frankenstein monster.We later learn that Dracula can only be killed in one way (that way is revealed late in the movie) but that way is super risky. Meanwhile Dracula is unleashing a plan to launch a vampire army to take over the world. It is up to Van Helsing, his beautiful slayer, and Frankenstein to defeat him and time is running out.A fun ride to the end.",8,0,1,24 January 2005
Collateral," One of the best thrillers in years!
","I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. Jamie Foxx, Tom Cruise, and Jada Pinkett-Smith all give top-notch performances. All of them are highly likable characters; even Cruise who plays a hit-man who appears unfeeling to his 'victims,' while being 'caring' to others, especially Foxx. What I liked about this is that it is different from most thrillers. It doesn't use the same tired tricks that other thrillers seem to use. (when someone appears dead, he is dead).There are some great dialogue exchanges with Cruise and Foxx as well as with Pinkett-Smith and Foxx.The movie never gets boring from beginning to end. This movie looks like a springboard for more roles for Foxx and Pinkett-Smith!",9,1,2,24 January 2005
The Butterfly Effect," I really liked it!
","I love these types of films. A movie of alternate realities where each small shift in the past causes a completely different present. Each time you watch in anticipation of the twist for the new reality.Kutcher is a troubled youth who was molested along with a young girl, by the girl's father and later is bullied by the girl's brother. The girl ends up committing suicide and Kutcher's life is haunted by his past. Kutcher is told by his analyst to keep a diary of everything that happens. In his college years, Kutcher finds that when he re-reads his diary, he is suddenly transported back to the actual events depicted in the diary. Each time Kutcher tries to make some adjustment to that event, to try to make things turn out better. But like the story of the butterfly that caused a tidal wave to occur, each little 'adjustment' for the good has a ripple effect on the future that causes not necessarily pleasant results.I was riveted by this movie until the end. The DVD comes with an alternate ending. I suggest you watch the regular ending first (it is the better of the two) before view the director's cut.",9,1,4,24 January 2005
Batman Begins," Great!
","After seeing the last three awful Batman movies I had to be coaxed to see this one. I was very glad that I went. This is not only by far the best Batman movie I have seen but the best comic adaptation film outside of the Spiderman movies! What always bothered me about Batman and my main sticking point with the Michael Keaton film was that he had all this elaborate equipment and this super high-tech batcave and it was never explained how he got it. Also, you wondered how nobody would be able to figure out who he was, especially the person who built the batmobile in that movie. Finally, we have a movie that explains everything and does it well.Also, Batman doesn't appear till more than halfway through the movie and we don't really care. The character of Bruce Wayne is fascinating and the director did such a good job of telling the murder of Wayne's parents that it was difficult to watch the scene without crying yourself.Liam Neeson is super in this film as a teacher to a troubled Bruce Wayne, schooling him in Ninjitsu and other fighting arts. Morgan Freeman is excellent as an employee of Wayne Enterprises who was pushed aside after the senior Wayne was murdered and who is in charge of a lot of R&D military equipment that he provides for Bruce. And of course Michael Caine makes a super Alfred! Then there is 'Sargent' Gordon, who seems to be one of the few non-corrupt police officers that Batman immediately identifies as someone he can trust for help.There are many memorable scenes in the film, especially where Bruce is making his first batarang and designing the Batman suit. The city looks a lot more realistic than any of the previous films (even though it doesn't look like the Gotham of the comics) as does the bat signal (it appears in the sky distorted, as it should).I hope the director can do as well with a sequel and not be tempted to go off on the 'camp' road that the other series of Batman films followed.",9,1,1,20 June 2005
Saving Private Ryan," The Most Realistic War Movie I Have Ever Seen!
","I guess with the age of video games and virtual reality upon us, it was only a matter of time for someone to capture the most realistic war scenes that have ever been depicted in film. The landing and ground fighting shown in the Normandy invasion literally makes the viewer feel like they were transported in time and are actually experiencing the real thing! Tom Hanks is brilliant as a shell-shocked veteran who is asked to perform a special service. That is to go through enemy territory and bring back the last surviving son of the Ryan clan. His other brothers having all recently perished in combat, leaving him the only remaining son.The movie grips you from the start and there are some well scripted scenes with a lot of surprises in Hanks search for the last Ryan. You go through the movie hoping that Hanks will find him soon and be able to leave the hell of war before his nerves are totally shot.What made this movie even more dramatic is that it is based on a true story! One of my favorite all-time war movies.",9,1,3,10 February 2005
28 Days Later...," Nowhere near as good as a Romero film
","This movie got a lot of attention like the Night of the Living Dead. I recently rented it and was greatly disappointed. This movie deals with a virus that makes people almost like mutant crazies that go around attacking other people. A group of people wander London trying to get back to 'civilization.' While the characters in George Romero's classic were interesting and you really felt for them, these characters are dull and sometimes act crazy themselves.The British accents were very difficult to understand at times. The climatic ending is in no way as good as Romero's film. In this film the survivors of the group keep trying to catch the attention of some overflying aircraft. They rig a big message and I guess they are rescued because the next scene is says it is 28 days later and the main character is in a hospital. Not worth buying.",5,1,2,24 January 2005
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," The Most Overrated Film I Ever Saw
","How could this movie make your top 10 list?  The plot was ridiculous.  The fight scenes were no big deal (generally any low budget Chinese Kung Fu movie has similar scenes.  What was with all the flying?   And the 70 year old woman who reads a manual and becomes an awesome Kung Fu master? 
The beginning of the movie introduces a sword that is very old (I think about 400 years) that gets stolen.  It then turns out that nobody really cares about the sword.It then turns out that an aristocratic young woman (who also read a manual and became and awesome Kung Fu master) stole the sword.  Why? It is never really explained.  She also had an affair with a guy in the desert who leads a band of rebels.  The scene where they meet involves him attacking her caravan and stealing her fan.  She chases after him on horseback.  There are some horse riding tricks performed as the two battle on their horses (something like Indiana Jones did in Raiders of the Lost Ark).The fight scenes are an insult to anyone that has studied martial arts.  One person can take on hundreds and never get tired.  (the director needs to see any Jean Claude Van Damme film to see what exciting fighting looks like) And then they fly and float in the air like Mary Martin in Peter Pan.  There is also a scene where the old woman shoots poisonous needles through a Gatling gun type device and the needles are blocked by the heroes swinging their swords.This movie is two hours long and the plot just didn't ever make sense. The ending was ridiculous too.  Hollywood must have made real garbage last year if this bomb could have been considered for an Oscar.",3,11,26,26 February 2001
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," More Thought on an Overrated Movie
","I am starting to feel like Elaine in the Seinfeld episode where she                 was the only one who hated The English Patient. 
                 I wanted to add so additional thoughts to my previous comments:                 People cannot fly and no amount of martial arts training can make that                  happen.  If the movie was supposed to be a fantasy then this should                  have been stated up front.                 Anyone that has sparred with an opponent hard for at least a minute                  will get winded.  No amount of training can change this. In the movie                  people are shown running and fighting at breakneck speeds without even                  cracking a sweat.                 People compare the fight scenes to The Matrix.  Well The Matrix had                  the idea that all of life was a computer simulation.  Thus the stunt                  that occurred were feasible.   As I stated before 'People cannot                  fly!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!'                 Getting to choreography, most fights are not pretty to watch.  Anyone                  who has seen the Ultimate Fighting Championship or any no-holds barred                  fighting event will attest to this.  However, for a movie fights have                  to be well choreographed to make it 'artistic' and exciting.  I will                  grant that.  Given that, a choreographed 'real fight' would look more                  like something out of a Chuck Norris or Jean Claude Van Damme film                  where fighters throw blows when they have openings and do not fight to                  an almost musical rhythem.                 Nobody and I repeat nobody can become a martial arts 'master' from                  reading a manual.  The skill comes from years of training and hard                  work from a skilled teacher.                 As I stated before the plot of this movie was so convoluted and                  boring.  The desert sequence seemed to be thrown in the middle to get                  some nice shots of the desert in the film.  This sequence totally                  breaks up the flow of the movie.                   There used to be Kung Fu movies that aired in New York on Saturday                  afternoons.  These were very low budget and usually had plots like:                  1.  The Magnificent Seven, where a group of bandits terrorizes a town                  and a bunch of Kung Fu guys get together to fight them                  2.  A relative or teacher is murdered.  The student or relative of                  the deceased then trains and goes to seek revenge.                   3. Some yo yo character begs to be trained by the Shaolin priests in                  Kung Fu (the Karate Kid had a similar theme) so he can go fight the                  bullies that have been picking on him.                 Anyone of the above had a more interesting plot than CTHD. In most of                  the above movies the only 'flying' we ever see is someone leaping very                  high to get into a tree or a high ledge.  This is done by running the                  camera backwards.  There is never the floating and walking across                  water that is shown in CTHD.  Each time this effect was done in CTHD I                  could see the characters shoulders hunched up or their clothing on                  their shoulder moved up like they were being picked up by strings.                 I can go on and on and shoot down any argument from these couch potato                  (ex. Roger Ebert) movie critics who don't have a clue what it takes to                  be a true martial artist and who have never been in a real brawl.",3,1,3,27 February 2001
Hellboy," Highly Entertaining!
","This movie was highly entertaining though a little hard to follow. Not being familiar with the comics, may have been the reason for my difficulties in following the plot. Hellboy is found during a raid on a Nazi operation near the end of the war. The Nazi's, with the aid of Rasputin (yes, The Rasputin from Russia) are trying to rig a contraption and open up a rift in a type of Hell and loose demons on Earth. The plot is foiled but the soldiers discover Hellboy. He is brought back and raised in secret by a kind of CIA organization.Years later Rasputin is back with the aid of a zombie swordsman and a reptilian creature that has numerous lives. Rasputin's plan is to use Hellboy to continue the attempt at opening up the rift in the universe to Hell. Great action ensues.Ron Perlman actually does a convincing job as Hellboy and look for John Hurt as Hellboy's mentor.",8,0,0,24 January 2005
The Incredibles," Good but not great!
","I had heard that this was by far the best Pixar film. Therefore I went with my kids expecting to be enthralled for 2 hours. What I got was a movie that was good but had a lot of periods where I found myself losing concentration.Yes the movie has its moments. There is a lot of good adult intended humor thrown in. But I am sorry that this movie is not nearly as good as either Shrek film or either Toy Story film.With a villain who is probably more annoying than Lord Farquard from Shrek , the movie also seems to have ripped off the Fantastic Four to come up with their characters. Let's see the similarities Mr Incredible - Mr. Fantastic (similar name), Plastic Girl - Mr. Fantastic (same power) Invisible Girl (same powers), Mr. Incredible - the Thing (both super strong). And then the boy is the same as Quicksilver and the Samuel L Jackson character is the same as The Iceman.My kids (11 and 8) preferred the Spongebob movie to this one. I gave that film 10 stars and this one 7 and a half.",7,2,5,24 January 2005
School of Rock," Entertaining!
","Jack Black plays a rock musician that gets kicked out of his band prior to the big battle of the bands contest. Unable to hold a job, Jack is pressured to pay up or get out by his best friends wife (Jack rents a room from them). Other than his music, Jack has no ambition towards work until he happens to answer the phone from his friend. It seems a school needs a substitute teacher and will pay well for Jack friend's services. Jack pretends to be his friend and goes to the school posing as his friend.The school happens to be a very upscale and exclusive private school. What happens the rest of the movie is totally unrealistic, but entertaining nonetheless. Jack is assigned a class and he sits in the front of the class being totally obnoxious with the kids and teaching nothing. By chance he happens upon a few of the kids in music class and realizes that they have talent. He cooks up the idea that he will be able to teach the kids how to play rock music and then go to the battle of the bands contest with the class.If you can dismiss how such a prominent school doesn't verify the credentials of its faculty (they don't ask for a driver's license, social security card, etc. that jobs are required to hire you), can't hear the loud music blaring down the halls, uncaring parents, etc., then the movie itself is highly entertaining.",8,0,0,24 January 2005
Hero," Much better than Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon!
","First off, this movie is way better than Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon. The fact that it is based on a legend in China makes it even better. Some of the most amazing directing and fight scenes I have ever seen. The fighting is about 95% with swords (Kung Fu wasn't invented until many centuries later) but it is spectacular nonetheless.Jet Li is a warrior who supposedly has killed three assassins who were trying to kill the emperor. As a reward, he is invited to the emperor's home (it is not really a palace but a big building) and allowed to approach the emperor within 10 paces (nobody else may come within 100 paces).He is given riches and must tell the tale how he disposed of the 3 assassins. The tale is told 3 different ways. Each time the director uses different colors. First, yellow and red, then green, and finally white. Each story is very different. The tension builds to a highly climatic and unexpected ending.Not to be missed!",10,1,1,24 January 2005
Million Dollar Baby," A Truly Great Film!
","had heard mixed reviews about the movie from sports fans so I held off seeing this film in the movies. I am sorry I waited because it is an excellent film, deserving of all the accolades it received. Hilary Swank, Clint Eastwood, and Morgan Freeman are all excellent and play characters with a lot of depth.The supporting characters are good from the wannabees at Eastwood's gym who spend more time heckling a member named Houston than actually doing any real training, to Swank's pathetic 'trailer park' family members.Note: possible spoiler ahead: The only issue I had with the film is the antics of the 'dirty' female fighter who does things behind the referee's back (like in a pro wrestling match) but is still caught on TV and she is never charged with any crimes even though her antics go way beyond any dirty stuff I have seen at hockey matches where players were criminally charged.",9,1,1,17 August 2005
Garden State," Very Deep and Very Funny
","This is a movie that makes a good try at being 'deep meaning' with a little humor thrown in but falls short. Zach Braff plays a displaced New Jersey young man who has moved to California and when he is not playing part-time actor he is wearing 'Charlie Chan' make-up in a pretentious Vietnamese restaurant.Zach gets a call from his father to return home to New Jersey because his mother has drowned in a bathtub accident. The dreamy, kind of insensitive Zach feels it is his duty to go. He kind of day dreams through the ceremony at the cemetery and then goes out partying with heavy drugs with his friends.Zach complains to his father about sharp headaches and his father sends him to a neurologist to get checked out. While there, two significant things happen. First he meets Natalie Portman who is kind of spaced out herself and then he learns that his problems are probably related to the drugs his psychiatrist father has been proscribing for him.Zach happens on Natalie later on and the two start hanging out together. There relationship slowly blooms and as there relationship improves they both realize that they are not really losers. Zach's problems relate to both the drugs he was taking and the guilt he had been carrying from a childhood incident involving his mother.The movie has some really hilarious parts and I understand that Zach was the actual writer/director. Not a lot of action but an enjoyable and very different type of movie.",8,0,2,24 May 2005
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," A different type of action thriller!
","If you liked a movie like Pulp Fiction (I believe it was from Tarantino too) you will definitely like this film. It is sliced into chapters that are each individual stories which do not happen in sequential order. Each chapter is excellent in itself (one chapter is done in animation) and the only reason I didn't rate the movie higher is the time sequencing sometimes gets confusing and by the end of the movie you still don't understand what happened to have Uma Thurman's wedding party attacked.The fight scenes are very unique and extremely gory, though a lot of the blood looks like colored water from a sprinkler. Tarantino has a lot of tributes to Bruce Lee such as using the Flight of the Bumblebee song (theme of the Green Hornet), having several of the villains wear Green Hornet masks, and having Uma wear a Bruce Lee type body suit (a la Game of Death) in the grand finale fight sequences.",8,1,2,24 January 2005
Annie Hall," Allen's best!
",This was the best movie Woody made from the time when he was still making great movies! It centers on Woody's on and off relationship with the ditzy Annie. Probably the movie that Seinfied got the humor for his show from! There are scenes like Woody standing in line for a movie that some loudmouth is explaining the meaning of to a bunch of women. When Woody disagrees with the man the man says that he should know because he teaches a college course about the movie to which Woody replies by bringing forward the movie's director. The director then tells the man he has no clue as to what the movie is about! Another involves Michael Moriarity as Annie's weird brother. He tells Woody that he fantasizes about wrecking his car when he is driving. Sure enough the next scene has Moriarity driving Annie and Woody home and Woody has this terrified expression on his face as Moriarity is driving.There are so many more of these types of hilarious scenes! This is a great film to own so you could memorize the lines.,10,1,4,24 January 2005
Toy Story," Super Entertainment for All
",I have watched this film many times with my kids and never tire of it. Original plot and superb characters make this movie a joy.  Great animation. I hope that this spawns a series.  Just wish I had kept some of those old toys I had when I was a child.,9,0,0,13 January 2000
Toy Story 2," Just as Good as the First
",Here is a sequel that equals its predecessor in sheer enjoyment.  Wonderful new characters make the story fresh.  Loved all the references to Star Wars. I will be one of the first to purchase the video when it comes out.  Hope that this is only the first in a long line of sequels or possible television series.,10,1,3,13 January 2000
The Last Samurai," Epic!
","In the tradition of the Shogun miniseries, this movie paints a wonderful picture of life under the Japanese Samurai. This time it is darning a time of modernization in Japan. Railroads and factories are being built. A Japanese army is being started, armed by some US entrepreneurs. They hire Tom Cruise, an often drunk army captain, to go to Japan and train the army in the use of the new rifles and to learn American war tactics.He starts training troops that can't hit a stationary target at all. He is told that there is an uprising against the Japanese emperor by a band of Samurai. Cruise is to take the vastly inexperience troops to kill them. Cruise complains that they are not ready but he is told to leave immediately.The attacking Samurai easily wipes out cruise's regiment and Cruise himself puts up an enormous fight. He is badly wounded but keeps fighting until he is unconscious. Just before passing out, he kills one of the most fearsome Samurai warriors.The head Samurai, fascinated to learn more about Cruise, spares him and sends Cruise to mend at his sister's house. His sister just happens to be the wife of the fallen warrior.Everyone in the village hates Cruise, and the woman is repulsed by the foreigner, who has shamed her by killing her husband. Little by little, Cruise becomes fascinated with life in the village and the Samurai training. He feels at peace and is cured of his alcoholic addiction. As he becomes more skilled with the sword he starts to win the admiration of the Samurai and he bonds with the woman's son.Cruise finally, earns his place in the village by being instrumental in driving back a ninja attack on the village. Eventually, Cruise will have to face the emperor's army now armed with cannon and fully training in using rifles.Great directing, action, and a riveting story. One of the best films Cruise has made. Just as good, if not better than the Shogun miniseries.",10,1,3,24 January 2005
National Treasure," Enjoyable!
",This is a good film to kill a few hours during the holiday season. It grips you from the start with interesting and likable characters (even the villain wasn't too bad) and a fast paced story-line that is a type of treaure hunt (a la Angels & Demons or The Da Vinci Code) where clues are followed to get from one place to the next. If you can overlook the obvious flaws (such as walking 7 miles in the Arctic circle with no problem and guards at National monuments that never seem to be around) then you will love this film.I am not normally a Nicolas Cage fan but he is excellent in this one and Jon Voigt gives a performance as Cage's father reminiscent of Sean Connery in the Indiana Jones movies.,8,0,0,24 January 2005
Pulp Fiction," Different but great!
","Anyone who has seen the Kill Bill movies can understand Tarrantino's style. This one has a series of stories, some of them related and most of them with John Travolta. One of my favorites involves Travolta and Samuel L Jackson who shoot a guy in their car. They need to clean themselves up and get rid of the 'mess.' Enter Harvey Keitel as a take charge kind of guy who approaches the problem like a swat team giving everybody orders of what to do, how to do it, and how long each step will take.Another tale involves Bruce Willis trying to guard a watch that was handed down from his grandfather to his father and then preserved by his father's friend (Christopher Walken) in his rectum during internment at a POW camp. Willis trying to get the watch back gets into a big fight with a crime boss and while they are fighting they are captured by sex fiends for torturous games.The movie breaks all rules and like Blue Velvet, is like no other movie I have seen before. I have seen the movie 4 times and seem to pick up something new about it each time I see it.",9,1,2,26 January 2005
It's a Wonderful Life," It's a Wonderful Movie!
","This rates up with my top 5 favorite movies of all time. I grew up on the Donna Reed show and remember that this was the movie I always saw her in and she was a lot more beautiful then. James Stewart is great as George Baily, the guy who wanted to help everybody and sacrificed his own financial success.The idea that one doesn't realize one's worth until you are removed from the equation has been copied hundreds of times since but never as well as this movie.Clarence is probably the most enjoyable bumbling character that I have ever seen. There is a cameo by an adult Alfalfa Sweitzer (for the Our Gang series) and the characters of Bert and Ernie later were immortalized by Sesame Street.The ending of this movie is the 'feel good' ending of all-time!",10,0,5,27 January 2005
A Beautiful Mind," Great!
","Highly riveting film with a super performance by both Russell Crowe and Ed Harris. Even though the director changed John Nash's life a great deal to make it a more entertaining movie. John Nash, a genius who came up with a business model that was adopted by many businesses, is a social oddball that is so dedicated to his studies that he has absolutely no concept of social skills. He finds it a task to even make the slightest bit of conversation with a female. The only person he seems to get along with is his college roommate (later we find out that this roommate is not what he seems). His genius attracts a government agency that employs him briefly as a code breaker. There he meets Ed Harris, who is not what he seems either. Ed has him working on top secret work that involves breaking secret transmissions from the Russians.Everything then starts to unravel and we learn the truth about the people that seem to influence John the most.Crowe gives a super performance in probably the role he was born to play!",8,0,2,24 January 2005
War of the Worlds," Way Better then Expected!
",Spielberg has done a superb job making this movie which is highly original from the 1953 version. In it Tom Cruise is an irresponible divorced father who is given charge of his two children for the weekend. The movie is about how he has to cope with death all around him while keeping his children and himself from becoming mad.There are some real touching and heart wrenching scenes especially when his young daughter is witnessing the horrors of people being vaporized and hungry mobs attacking their car.The special effects are phenomenal and the story grips you from start to finish.There were a few confusing things like what the aliens were actually doing to the humans. It seems like they were mixing the humans' blood with some sort of plant to create vines all over everything. I hope that Spielberg will explain this when the DVD comes out.,9,1,7,5 July 2005
Man on Fire," Denzel gives a good performance
","Denzel does a great job playing a former government agent assigned to protect a little girl from kidnapping in Mexico City. When he is assigned he is ready to kill himself. He and the little girl develop a type of father/child relationship that is so strong that it gives him reason to live. When the girl is actually kidnapped, Denzel goes on a rampage against anyone that was involved, meting out vigilante justice.Some scenes may be a little graphically violent and the actual kidnapping scene is a heartbreaker, but it is a story that it is one of those rare action films that has its heartwarming scenes too! Christopher Walken is pretty good as Denzel's friend and look for Marc Anthony as the little girl's father.",9,0,0,24 January 2005
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," A Shame it had to end!
",Lucas does a phenomenal job of tying up all the loose ends and showing how Anakin becomes Darth Vader. Natalie Portman is as gorgeous as ever (she didn't look too good in Garden State) and the light saber fights are awesome. There is one scene in particular where Obi Wan fights a robot that has several light sabers in his multiple arms.The only problem I had was that the Jedi seemed to be defeated too easily after all when they have the force working for them they should be able to know when they will be ambushed. Only Yoda seemed to have this power but I guess he is the most powerful Jedi.There was a surprise appearance of Chewbacca and some funny parts with R2D2. Should not be missed.,8,5,8,28 May 2005
Paths of Glory," Probably Douglas' best film!
","I saw this film in a college course on film and I realize why. It is one of the best-directed films ever made. The black and white works to perfection. This is my favorite Kirk Douglas film about the French military during WWI. A group of French soldiers are sent on an impossible mission. When they obviously fail, the General afraid of losing face for a stupid decision decides to court martial some of the soldiers as a punishment. Three soldiers are singled out. One obviously fought very bravely and another was hit on the head and knocked unconscious during the battle. Their stories are futile against the kangaroo French military court. Douglas tries valiantly to act as their legal council and present their defense in vain. From what I understand this film is still banned in France! I guess the humiliating loss during WWII did nothing to sway the French military from its self-conceived notion of being a great military power!",10,0,0,25 January 2000
The Matrix," Excellent!
","This is the first and the best Matrix film. Keanu Reeves stars as Neo, a corporate suit and tie kind of guy who seems to be drawn into a revolution against society. He seems to be drawn to a warrior woman in a black leather biker outfit who is being hunted by what appear to be CIA agents.Neo than meets her boss Morpheus (played brilliantly by Larry Fishburne)and suddenly Neo starts to question whether his 'reality' is in fact real or is reality inside some sort of computer network.This movie has some of the best choreographed fights scenes I have ever seen including the big fight with Agent Smith in the subway. An excellent film that stands on its own (though there were two sequels, they weren't necessary)!",9,0,1,26 January 2005
The Wizard of Oz," Perfect!
","Anyone growing up in the 60's can remember that this movie was an annual must see TV event! Even 40 years later it still is as fresh as when it was first released. They don't make em like this anymore and it is quite a shame. The innocent Dorothy, conked on the head during a tornado, is mysteriously transported to a world that comes alive with color. She awakens in the psychedelic land of the Munchkins and immediately becomes a target for the Wicked Witch of the West. Protected by the beautiful Glenda and charmed by the entertaining Munchkins, Dorothy sets off for the city of OZ where she hopes to find the wizard that will be able to send her home back to Kansas. Along the way she meets three friends who become some of the most memorable characters in movie history. Interesting documentary footage added to the DVD ending showing Buddy Ebsen as the Tin Man and scenes that never made the movie. This is a movie for both adults and kids of all ages. My own kids started watching it from the time they were 3!",10,3,7,24 January 2005
The Island," The Best Summer Movie So Far!
","I have seen Star Wars III, Batman Begins, War of the Worlds, and The Fantastic Four. While all those movies were excellent, The Island outshines them all. Scarlett Johansen and Euwene MacGregor are excellent as clones who have lived in an enclosed city with the promise of an ultimate trip to 'The Island.' This is supposed to be the ultimate reward for their service and those that get chosen to go, do so via a lottery.MacGregor starts to get haunted by a dream where he is on a boat and being drowned. He tells this dream to the city doctor who appears to be more than intrigued by it, in fact he has a mechanical table violently take hold of MacGregor and inject robot mini probes into the sides of his eyes.MacGregor's curiosity makes him start to question everything and it is sparked more by a maintenance man (Steve Busemi) who lives outside the enclosed city. (The people are told that the outside was contaminated from a great catastrophe). This curiosity continues to increase when he finds a rather large insect. MacGregor starts to learn the real truth behind the 'lottery' and save his lady friend (Johansen) who has won the lottery and is scheduled to go to the supposed island.The rest of the movie plays out like a super high tech version of Logan's Run. The special effects are amazing especially the futuristic Los Angeles. Even though you can kind of figure what will happen, the movie is compelling mostly due to the excellent acting of the two stars.",9,1,5,25 July 2005
The Godfather," Great!!!!!
","Totally superb from acting to directing to plot to dialogue.  Definitely in my top 10 list and a joy to watch over and over again.  To be fair there are a few negatives.  At times it is difficult to understand what Marlon Brando is saying.  Also, having read the book, there are some interesting characters and sub-plots that are hardly developed in either this move or the sequel.  The character of Luca Bracci was never fully appreciated in the movie and he appears almost to be a buffoon.  In the book he is an incredibly feared individual that had wiped out some competing mobs single handedly.  You could say he was the Michael Jordan of hitmen.The character of Lucy was just seen as a tramp used by Santino in the movie where she was a fairly interesting character as well as Johnny Fontaine. Anyone who has seen the movie should also read the book to understand what I mean.",10,1,3,15 March 2000
