Source Code," Duncan Jones seals his place among the top directors of today
","Most directors tend to stumble for their second film, others far exceed them while Duncan fits nicely in between those two extremes and follows up his very impressive debut, Moon, with this well-executed thriller.While this is more mainstream than Moon was it doesn't make the film any less thought provoking and exciting, if anything it exceeded my expectations. Based on what the film industry is churning out recently this film particularly stands out for me.But all the credit shouldn't be down to Duncan. The script is really well written with some smart dialogue and a cleverly crafted story that keeps you guessing. Jake Gyllenhaal also gives a very convincing performance along with a great supporting cast that overall will make this film go down as probably one of the more underrated films this side of the summer blockbusters.",7,0,5,1 April 2011
Avatar," Great technical experiment... bad film (2D Review) & Must watch in 3D
","The hype I had for this film was unbelievable, I couldn't believe when I got up today that I was actually going to see it. Got back home, sat on the sofa and was heartbroken by what I saw.What happened James Cameron, you used to be such a great storyteller but now you carried away by the world and technology you're creating for this film and put characters and plot on the back-burner. The characters were clich√©d and stock, the plot was uninspiring and was just 'Dances with Wolves' or 'Pochantas' in space.The visual effects and James Horner's Oscar worthy score were the main redeeming factors for me. I'll admit now I watched it in 2D, I'm seeing it in 3D tomorrow (don't ask, I brought the tickets in advance but today I just went to the cinema. That might claw some things back.The only other thing I can say though is that Zoe Saldana's performance was good and 2009 has been a good year for her, out of all motion-captured performances, Na'vi and Avatars, hers had the most emotion to relate to, which if I'm honest was practically rare in this film. I'll take my hat off as well to Sigourney Weaver for having a solid performance and was genuinely sad when she died. Apart from that everyone else was sub-par.Overall the visual effects were amazing but it was let down by the uninspiring plot and underdeveloped characters.For now I'll give it 6 maybe 7, if I'm nice, out of 10 It might go up tomorrow when I watch it in 3DEDIT:Well now that I've watched it 3D I can say that its one of the most beautiful looking films I've seen, I got lost on the world of Pandora and the 3D literally added that extra depth that was missing when I first watched it in 2D. The only way you can experience this film is to watch in 3D, they shouldn't have released it in 2D at all.My original opinion still stands on the plot and characters, but getting over what I didn't like and watched it for what it was I found it highly enjoyable in many senses. Not the best film of 2009, or this decade or ever as many people are claiming, but there are far worse films out there like Transformers 2.So overall I'll give the film 6/10 but in 3D I'll give 8/10",5,6,13,18 December 2009
