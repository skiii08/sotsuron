3:10 to Yuma," The easiest of all movie genres to write for
","Performances aside, the easiest genre to write successfully for was the western. While a successful musical took many talented parts, the western took the script and the actor. A comedy took a somewhat funny situation, the right actor with the right timing, and and a good script, and a drama had to have a script that kept audiences on the edge of their seats. A western was luckier. A bad guy, sometimes illustrated by gunfights, and a sheriff in white hat ... a film maker's dream compared to the other movie genres. There is nothing out of the ordinary in the cast presented here. The sheer number of Glenn Ford fan clubs told you how many films he had been in -- although he was rather a subdued, normal actor, unwilling to break out of the box. Nice guy, but where are the acting chops? They are there only in westerns -- where everything is over-the-top dramatic due to death being around the corner (something not true of the real 'old west' of the 1870s onward). The Old West is another Hollywood invention, devised again to sell movies. In this genre, they played it safe. Nothing ventured, but a lot to gain, so why not ... ? So many great musicals could have been done, so many comedies and dramas produced, but the money went toward the safe venue...the western. As much of a cartoon as Bugs Bunny ever was. The western was too easy, especially when Hollywood had started out with classics from Errol Flynn, Myrna Loy, William Powell, Frank Morgan, Irene Dunne, Jimmy Cagney, Judy Garland, Jimmy Stewart, Bette Davis, Joan Crawford, Norma Shearer, Kay Francis, et. al.",1,0,7,19 July 2019
Mamma Mia!," Could Have Been the Musical of the Century with All Those Exceptional Songs
","Abba is done a great disservice by the terrible plot. This limits its appeal and makes the plot sequel an unmitigated disaster.But what great music! The writers had so much to work with and could have done exceptionally well with plot. Instead, they have done exceptionally well with the musical production. It sounds grand -- almost as spectacular as ABBA. It does not capture what could have been the musical of the century, given all that it had to work with.",10,1,2,9 April 2019
Saving Mr. Banks," Hanks Miscast and Cannot Carry the Movie as Walt Disney
","Tom Hanks is miscast here. He could not bring out the real Walt Disney -- who appeared every week as himself on 'Walt Disney Presents'. Disney did not have a forced southern accent, like Hanks deploys, and Hanks' outlook and mannerisms did not fit the reality of the Walt Disney.It is hard to act at this level, granted, but Hanks did not even try. He simply leaned on his already successful career rather than try to act in this movie.
Hanks is a movie star, but he shows here he cannot act.The movie would be much better without Hanks in it. This probably is not a hindrance to young people who have never heard or seen the real Disney. But thousands of hours of film on Disney is still around, and Hanks could have watched, learned, and tried.",3,1,10,29 July 2019
True Romance," How Shall New Criminology be Used -- Tarantino-wise or by the Truth?
",Tarantantino begins his rush at notoriety by condemning millions of young people to fans and some to followers. His genius could better have been turned toward fascinating youth toward taking the new technology toward the power of truth and goodness.,1,3,23,19 July 2019
