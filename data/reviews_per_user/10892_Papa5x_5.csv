Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Not Bad
","Took my grandson to see it the other day. Lucas did a good job with the visual pageantry and again the visual effects were great and the princess was prettier than the earlier version. My grandson liked it. Don't get me wrong it's a really nice film, it's just that I expected more. It didn't live up to the hype.",7,0,0,23 July 1999
Erin Brockovich," A true story of corporate disregard for human life
","I've been a Julia Roberts fan since Pretty Woman. She delivers a strong performance to which we have become accustomed. If Erin Brockovich is anything like the character Julia portrayed she should consider running for president, it would be an improvement over what's available now.",9,1,1,31 March 2000
Sleepy Hollow," Silly, Silly, Silly
","My grandson, his dad and I went to see this film over the Thanksgiving day weekend. We went to an early evening showing to a packed theater. I thought to myself this must be good. Well it was all downhill from there. The plot was unimaginative and inconsistent. Cauterized be-headings with a cold blade, our mortal inspector riding a ghost horse and I'm still not sure what our heros repressed childhood had to do with the story. Confused? Well I still am. It did have a happy ending however and my 12 year old grandson thought it was cool.  Yes he said cool. I give it a 5 but only for the great costumes and scenery.",5,1,3,29 November 1999
The Matrix," Tech age shoot em up
",This is a great state of the art action film. Special effects are the best I've ever seen. Plenty of action for every one.,8,0,0,24 April 1999
Tarzan," Must see for almost all ages
",This is a great film - nicely done. It manages to tap into all of your emotions. Although it is rated G for all ages some of the violent action may be a little frightening for the very young. Other than that it's a story worth experiencing.,9,1,1,24 June 1999
