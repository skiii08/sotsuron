Despicable Me 2," Underwhelming, but cute
","I really liked the first film, so I was definitely looking forward to the sequel. I thought it to be one of the best animated movies the summer box office would offer.I can't say this movie is bad whatsoever. I can say it was overwhelming and the plot practically nonexistent. Despicable Me 2 is the epitome of cute, but hardly thought-provoking like the first film or features like PIXAR's (most of them).Gru and Lisa had an adorable meet-cute and Agnes, Edith, and Margot are equally adorable. However, the villain and the ending of the film before the last scene was anti-climactic and leaves questions.Overall, not a misfire and a moneymaker. Will I watch again? Probably not. Honestly, I kept thinking I was getting too old to enjoy films like this, but I do love many animated films. This was not one of them.",2,2,4,26 July 2013
Walk the Line," Excellent biopic
","Walk the Line is one of my favorite biopics. The film has pretty much everything: great acting, believable sets, cast chemistry, and a solid script and good editing. Joaquin Phoenix absolutely nails it as the hulking persona of Johnny Cash. He captures the voice, mannerisms, and general personality quite well. Reese Witherspoon deserves the Best Actress Oscar for her performance as the lovely and charming June Carter. Her portrayal is on point and she plays the Southern lady who was a woman before her time and fell in love despite herself. The love story of Johnny and June is legendary and Walk the Line depicts it well. The events that occurred in the film are not 100% accurate, but the spirit of the story is preserved and is mostly true excepting a few details.The supporting cast in Shooter Jennings, Waylon Payne, Johnathan Rice, and Tyler Hilton to name a handful is superb. They're genuinely performing their characters' songs and are talented musicians themselves. Overall, a film that is more than worth re-watching. Phoenix and Witherspoon are dynamite and the rest is an added bonus.",10,0,0,14 July 2013
The Theory of Everything," Redmayne is brilliant!
","James Marsh's film, 'The Theory of Everything,' as a whole has some narrative and directorial flaws. However, it inhabits two amazing Oscar worthy performances by Eddie Redmayne and Felicity Jones.Redmayne is stellar as the afflicted genius Stephen Hawking from beginning to end. The actor has been on the cusp of a breakout for years and this is it for him. Redmayne should win Best Actor for this portrayal. He captures the mannerisms and flat out embodies Hawking to the nth degree.Jones holds the film together. She imbued Jane Hawking with the love and patience necessary with the role and beautifully expresses the desperation and despair Jane feels after decades with Stephen.David Thewlis is solid in his supporting role as Dennis Sciama. Charlie Cox is also good as Jonathan Hellyer JonesGood movie and often emotional. Great work by the two leads.",7,2,5,30 November 2014
The Runaways," Watch! Solid and well acted biopic
","'The Runaways' is an amazing slice of the 1970s and depicts the unexpected rise of an all- girl rock and roll band. This was in a time when women weren't really considered or allowed to be rockers.The main three actors: Kristen Stewart, Dakota Fanning, and Michael Shannon are each excellent in their portrayals as Joan Jett, Cherie Currie, and Kim Fowley. Stewart encapsulates the tension, edge, and desperation that was a teenage Jett during the time she was frantically trying to make her career happen. Jett lives for the music, whereas Currie did not and that came across beautifully. Shannon acted as the eccentric and off-the-wall, and often vulgar legendary record producer to a tee. Stewart and Fanning have that electric and elusive 'chemistry' that Hollywood always seeks for. Their relationship in the film is poignant, and well past believable. The roller rink kissing scene, in particular, where they shotgun a joint is thick with sexual tension. The casting director got this one right.The supporting cast: Tatum O'Neal, Scout Taylor-Compton, and Riley Keough to name a few were each outstanding in their small roles as family members and for Taylor-Compton portraying metal legend Lita Ford.However, the music is naturally the driving force behind this film. Stewart, Fanning, and Co. all sang and played very well and very accurately. The 'Cherry Bomb' performance is on point and Stewart's roller rink performance of 'I Love Playin' With Fire' is the epitome of Joan Jett. The 'Dead End Justice' performance is equally well done. No bones about it. The rest of the soundtrack is great. Suzie Quatro's 'The Wild One,' Bowie's 'Rebel Rebel,' Nick Gilder's 'Roxy Roller,' and The Stooge's 'I Wanna Be Your Dog' and 'Gimme Danger' are all excellently placed and suit the scene very well. The inclusion of Jett's post-Runaways songs, 'I Want You,' and 'Crimson & Clover' and 'I Love Rock N Roll' are great too.",10,2,4,27 July 2013
