The Blair Witch Project," One of the worst movies I've ever seen - LAME
",After reading the rave reviews and seeing the scifi special - I was really looking forward to seeing a scary great flick - Instead it was completely stupid and unbelievable.  I was bored throughout the movie and the entire audience left feeling completely taken!Save your money on this one - The muppet movie is probably scarier!!!,1,1,3,1 August 1999
The Blair Witch Project," This movie sucked - not scary at all and stupid to boot
",After all the rave reviews about this movie - I had to see it opening weekend.  It was really one of the worst films I have ever seen.  It was totally unbelievable and I did not get scared once.  The critics said this was one of the most scary movies they have ever seen - I wonder how much they paid them to write these reviews.Do yourself a favor and see something else.  The entire audience I was with left disappointed.,1,1,3,1 August 1999
