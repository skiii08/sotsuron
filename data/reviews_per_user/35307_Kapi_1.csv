The Blair Witch Project," Different, very good, but like watching an 80 minute trailer
","It's an interesting film, and I hope other horror movies follow suit. One warning, however, if you are the type who demands an ending that answers all questions and ties up all loose ends, then this movie isn't for you. You are forced to think and to imagine what happens to the characters, and at the end, you will have more questions that when the movie begins. All in all, the movie is very good, but not quite as good as I've head the movie to be. Some of the things the characters do, I would have done differently had I been in their situation (like not bringing a GPS locator). Of all the movies I've ever seen, this one came the closest to actually scaring me. I would definitely recommend The Blair Witch Project.",8,1,2,13 August 1999
