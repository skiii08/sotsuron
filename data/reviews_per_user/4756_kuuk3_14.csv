Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter," A fun film, but not without flaws
","It was good to see an original idea on the big screen. In a year full of sequels, prequels, remakes, reboots and even one film that was all the above, it was refreshing to see a film that didn't rely on a past film. The first thing that got me was the low resolution camera. I don't usually even look at stuff like that, but when I see YouTube videos with more high definition clarity – I do wonder what on earth this film was shot on. Many of the shots were unfocused or simply lacked the clarity that I'm use to. Everything had been colour graded to make it look old and pastel like. I can hear some of you say its to give us the atmosphere of age – but there have been many films set in the past and they didn't need to 'age' the film to get us in the mood. When it's on the big screen, I really want to see each and every hair on the actors head shine through – you simply did not get that with this film. They never even bothered to explain how these Vampires could walk around in sunlight. At one point they mentioned sun block but that got ridiculous pretty quick. The same goes for crucifixes, holy water, entering a person's home uninvited and all that stuff; it was all ignored. There were no stakes thrust through the heart and for some reason, a vampire shot in the head decides to keep the lodged bullet in himself for no reason other than why not. When he can turn to dust, you wonder why the bullet didn't just drop to the floor anyway. Vampires cannot kill each other, but you can hit them many, many times – and maybe accidentally kill them. When Adam thought there was silver in the box and tried to kill Henry on the train – how was he able to even attempt to kill him? It simply didn't make sense. The acting was good and I was hooked throughout the film. The action was wicked and the camera kept focus on all that was happening without moving about too much which was good. There were lots of decapitations and yet they found as many different ways to kill a vampire in the same method which was interesting and stopped it from getting repetitive. We were never informed about the main bad guys – who they were, where they came from, what their motives were or why there was a chain of command. They were simply there because the film needed a bad guy and a bunch of cannon fodder to get killed. Mary was engaged at the start of the film to Stephen – yet started dating Abraham while still engaged with no opposition, and then got married. The story arch between her and Stephen I'm presuming was cut out in the edit room as it really made no sense why Stephen just vanished from the film. There was a lot of politics, interwoven into a vampire story and at times it felt like you were watching two different films edited together. Maybe even three if the subplot between Stephen and Mary hadn't been cut out, and maybe even four if we learnt more about his rise to Presidency, which seemed to happen overnight. Its worth watching, but I wanted more answers and explanations for some of the decisions that were made and it made a few artistic choices too many in my opinion – such as Vampires in sunlight – oh well, at least they didn't sparkle!",6,3,6,21 June 2012
Ready Player One," Captures the adventure of the book, but lacks the heart and character growth.
","The book is better. It always will be. I think everyone knows that you cannot take a 15 hour book and condense it to a 130 minute movie without losing a lot of what made it special. Firstly there is no after-credit scene. So dont bother waiting. The opening title was just white text on a black screen, which is rather disapointing given the clever 'maze' logo all the marketing had.The film gets rid of the gates, most of the real world stuff, all the school stuff, and all character development. Our heroes just have all the weapons, cars, robots that they had to earn in the book. Even before finding the first key. Wade already owns the Delorian and Aech just happens to have Iron Giant in his garage. They make a number of dramatic changes to the main plot, some for visual storytelling (such as adding a car chase) and others to expand the role other characters worth in the plot, such as Art3mis going to IOI instead of Parzival. My main issue was the lack of character arcs. They all strated off strong, and ended the exact same way. The heart of the book was how this normal person rose from being one of us, to the savior of the universe. The film is missing that. Wade no-longer talks to the sweet old lady at the bottom of the stacks. He no-longer fixes people's old oasis machines, instead he steals there gloves? 
Those real world connections are lost and he just seems like a rich spoilt kid from the start. His reasons for not joining IOI are never explained. We as audinence members have no idea why he would not have taken the money. But on that, IOI are also made out to be idiots. They dont solve any puzzles or collect any of the keys. In the book they were far more competent. Then there is the whole rebellion side story which was not in book, hardly touched upon, was not explained, had unexplained henchmen, and ended abruptly. But the sheer fact that they had an army to fall back on in the real world weakened our connection to them for us as an audience. They were no longer the small guy going after the big corporation, now they were a small army going after what seemed to be just one man (Nolan) who was afraid of guns, and a mercenary woman who was beaten up by an eleven year old kid. The bad guys became a joke. Not to mention so stupid in that they keep there passwords written down for the world to see. The film captures the adventure and spectacle of the book thats for sure, but is missing its heart. And they shoehorned several side characters (Rick) into the movie which really could have been left out and there screen time devoted to more puzzle solving or building the relationship. They could have left i-Rok, Daito and Shoto out the story and it would not have changed anything. In fact, giving Nolan all of i-R0ks jobs would have helped his character. There is almost zero world building for the real world. They show pizza delivery drones that can fly around the city and place bombs on buildings, but somehow are unable to follow a giant delivery truck featuring the worlds most wanted down the road. Ignoring speed cameras and satellite tracking as well. Again, another example of incompetency the villains demonstrate. Perhaps I love the book so much, that its hard for me to separate the source material for this movie adaptation. But the book was not just about 80s nostalgia, it was about growth of characters as they went on this adventure together. It was about making sacrifices when needed and learning to work as a team to open the last gate. None of which was required for this movie. I also want to mention the lack of nostalgia music. The trailers had some great songs, with Pure imagination being outstanding. None of them however are played in the movie. With the exception of jump at the start, that felt out of place as it was too fast paced for someone just walking. Still watch it in the cinema as its an experience you have to see. But read the book, or listen to the great Will Wheaton audiobook as well, as its a very different story with more depth and love than the film portrays. I rate it 6.5 out of 10.",7,134,260,20 March 2018
Man of Steel," Best film ever in all existence!
","Where do i begin with how much i live this film! Lets start at the simple, direct easy to follow plot that had zero, make that zero plot holes. Iron man and star trek both had more plot holes that i could count. They ruined those films because your taken out of those worlds because something stupid happens like blowing up armour and teleporters that work between planets . In superman, i was never taken out of it ever. Every move makes sense. Every action has a reason, purpose and consequence. All is explained to a satisfactory level.The action and fights were exactly what we wanted to see, on an epic scale worthy of 2013 and beyond. I love this film, and thank everyone so, so much for making it. This is my new all time number 1 favourite film of all time.",10,1,3,14 June 2013
Divergent," I walked out the cinema. Its that bad.
","I love films set in the future, but this film had nothing futuristic about it. It may have well have been set in 1940 as thats the level of technology you see in this world.I have not read the book, but this film was boring. For over two hours your watching nameless kids go to school. But nothing happens! There are no student rivalries, no interesting characters that set them apart, no class clown. Every character was EXACTLY the same and none of them did anything unique or memorable.If there was a villain, i didn't see him or her in the 100 minutes i watched it before walking out. It was just a bunch of kids attending class! Even the teachers were kids. Adults don't even exist in this world for longer than a few seconds every half hour.No explanation was given about the war, the world, the wall. The class factions might have been benefited by a sixth faction called 'builders' that actually tried repairing all the buildings in that city. As it stood, there was no-one around to build or repair anything. The whole mystery about 'divergent' was barely touched in the time I watched it, and I had given up waiting for answers when I walked out. It lacked any likable and interesting characters, any resemblance of a plot other than completing high school, it lacked a villain or conflict of any kind. Story-telling 101 was ignored completely and the only thing that gave the rating an extra star was the cinematography and panoramic views of the destroyed city which impresses well for a few seconds, before being ruined by the characters getting in the way of the camera and blocking our view.",2,9,16,4 April 2014
Ender's Game," Harry Potter in Space
","I have not read the book, nor had I seen the trailer before watching this movie. But it doesn't take long to realise that this franchise is trying yet again to break into the teen fiction market, with yet another scenario change just enough to make it appear different. But swapping the halls of Hogwarts for a space station, the quiddich game for laser tag, Dumbledore for Harrison Ford, Voldermort for the bugs from Starship Troopers and Hermione, Ron & Harry for three other nameless children is all feel like Harry Potter in Space. The film is watchable, but I have no plans to buy the Blu Ray. The big twist ending even a blind monkey could predict. The child's problem solving skills were nothing any kid playing GTA couldn't have figured out. They were never a real test of ability and sending in a kid playing a computer game instead of a seasoned General with actual combat experience seemed silly at the end. Maybe it made more sense in the book, who knows. But here, if all they wanted to accomplish was win, send in a stealth nuke and be done with it. The plot made no sense as to why proved tested military weapons of today couldn't defeat them, or why the technology of the future allowed telescopes that could see absolutely everything, everywhere or why AI couldn't do the job better. The good news is what took Harry Potter eight films to accomplish, they did it in one. The effects were okay and the acting credible. The bad parts - the future looked very much like today. Its military based cadet school for 85% of it and full of young kids so you have to like your army films. Yet children are visibly killed which means you wouldn't really want to show it to your kids. I guess they weren't too sure who to aim the film at in regards to a target audience. Its okay, but i was hoping for so much more and would definitely liked to have seen more of the enemy and there attack on Earth so as to give us audience a reason to hate them and understand the humans motivation for doing what they did. Instead we felt sorry for the aliens and left the cinema on a bit if a downer, which is never good.",3,12,71,26 October 2013
The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug," Name one of the dwarfs. Just one.
","Were six hours in, and without looking at the cast list on the front on IMDb, I challenge anyone to name one of the 13 Dwarfs. I would also say the same for the elf people and the brown wizard, but chances are there are some fans that will know their names from the books. But i still have no idea who any of them are, or what they bring to the table. Not a single character is interesting. I don't care about anyone and one moment the dwarfs are useless, then in the next they are a one man army in a Naked gun film. Orcs are thrown at them like cannon fodder and an army of them prove useless. Its was like watching a Tom & Jerry cartoon where death is meaningless and pointless.I was bored, this film resolved nothing to the story and was simply filler. It looked pretty, but lacked characters to care about and a plot you wanted to follow.",2,17,33,16 December 2013
The Amazing Spider-Man 2," Faithful to the comics. Worth watching
","Im not going to reveal any spoilers in this review, but I do mention a few things so don't read me if you haven't seen the film yet.There are a few plot niggles that irritate die-hard comic fans like myself. For example, Spider-man does not get ill, he has a healing factor which is the entire plot point for several of the other characters in the film. He could heal from electric hits in seconds, but is taken out with the common cold?There were a lot of subplots. From the school graduation, to Aunt Mays new job. The origin of Rhino, Electro, Goblin and several others which are rather easter eggs for those in the know, the Gwen love story, the aftermath of the first film, the death of Several key characters, hallucinations of past characters, moving to another country, the back-story about his parents, the corporate takeover, the Ben parker conspiracy investigation. If you don't pay attention you will miss a lot of exposition. And some of the plots like The conspiracy and London don't add anything to the overall story. They just fizzle out with that strand of the plot apparently ended and deemed no-longer important. They could have edited a lot more out of the film and you wouldn't have missed anything. Im glad they edited out Mary Jane as there would have been no reason for her to be there. The action is great, and the special effects superb. At some point though, they have to start equipping the cops with decent weapons since they know the danger levels they are facing and handguns are no-longer appropriate. Also maximum security prisons seem to be stupidly lapse in security. That scene was a joke. Transporting plutonium through a major city and letting it get hijacked by three thugs was also a joke. Where are the spike traps, helicopters, snipers etc. We need our superheroes to do the stuff us normal humans cant do. Not make the humans so stupid that the heroes simple balance out their inadequacies of common sense. The film is enjoyable viewing that I recommend. But better character motivations, fine- tuning the police to seem competent and eliminating irrelevant plot strands would have been welcomed. I also would have liked to see his injuries carry on to the next fight or day, so we can see what impact that being Spider-man has on his life of Peter Parker. He may have a healing factor, but he's not Wolverine. His scars are suppose to take days to heal, not seconds.",7,17,38,16 April 2014
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Ridiculous Plot Points
","Ridiculous Plot Points1. A single fighter takes out every space gun on an imperial battle ship, that does not even bother to raise its shields? And only one of those many guns can hit the ship? Thats there only job!2. The First Order don't even bother releasing X-wings to take out the fighter until after he has finished hurting them. 3. BB8 literally uses his head to fix a broken control panel? 4. The entire Rebel fleet is on a single ship, which has the ONLY shield in the entire galaxy. Yet there is an entire Rebel base a short distance away, deserted but fully operational? 5. The Rebel ship's shields are indestructible. An entire fleet of first order star destroyers are firing at it, yet every single shot bounces off. What point is a fleet that cant take out a single ship? 6. Leia should have died in space. When she opened her eyes and came back to life after the explosion, decompression, hypothermia, and burst lungs. She would have had a concussion from the blast, poped lungs and was blinded when she opened her eyes in a vacuum. She also cannot fly herself back to the door of a broken ship. 7. Then, the crew could not open that door without killing themselves in the process. The corridor led to the vacuum of space. There is no way she could get inside!8. Finn wakes up, naked and sprouting water. Why was he wearing a portable jacuzzi? 9. If the rebels can turn the ship around and fly it into the enemy, why didn't they do that with the two support vessels before they were destroyed? 10. And if flying ships into the enemy does more damage than missiles, set them on autopilot and do that instead.11. Kylo Ren has his top off. Why?12. There is a black sinkhole in Lukes Garden, with a magic mirror in it. That literally does nothing. 13. Rey has lightsaber skills, with zero lessons. Her entire force powers are unexplained. 14. She can leave the Falcon in an escape pod, which can fly to the very hull of the star destroyer, and just walk through the shield door of the cargo bay. Both the Falcon and the pod should have been blown up before they got that close. And the rebels should just send an armed nuke across in the same manner. 15. Snoke does not detect betrayal in Kylo. So much for master Sith. His powers are a joke. 16. Yoda's ghost laughing and causing a targeted lightning strike while dead. If he has that power, why not continue doing it on Stoke and Kylo while at it?17. The rebel base has a big metal door, which they leave wide open for the enemy. why? It should have been shut asap. 18. The rebel base apparently only has the one entrance trapping them inside. But in the very next second, we see the troops leaving through small doors and going outside to the trenches, and fighters ships leaving from above the door. Why not just escape via those routes? 19. They try closing the door, but one enemy ship gets through. And oh what a coincidence, it just happens to have Finn and Rose on board. What are the odds?20. Luke has a ship hidden under the water. But instead of using it to be helpful, he projects a hologram of himself, but still dies anyway? What was the point of that? 21. The kid at the end uses telekenis to make the broom come to his hand. Clearly he is going to use his force powers to 'clean' up the galaxy. 22. Porgs. Now they are stealing from Star Trek with Tribbles. 23. Chewie can fly the massive Falcon through a complicated cave system, without crashing. With tunnels just the right size for his large but narrow ship, and survive on his first attempt. And also find a convenient exit... with skills like that, you wonder why in the earlier films he was manning the gun and Solo was the one flying. 24. The ancient Jedi texts are not page turners, nor have they been copied or digitalised or had backups made of them. As paper, they would have rotted away naturally around all that salt water with age. 25. Finn is about to sacrifice himself to destroy the cannon, and save the rebels. Yet Rose stops him, and kisses him while in the background we watch all their friends die in a massive fire blast. Timing is everything.26. How did the first order get a massive cannon, and all the walkers and ships down to the planet in the seconds lead they had chasing them? Do they just have all these land based vehicles on tie fighters ready for launch? Why would a star destroyer have a door blasting cannon in storage anyway? 27. The double agent hacker they just happen to bump into while in jail. Befriends BB8 and helps them, was apparently a spy for the first order. How on earth did he know they were going to be in that cell, at the end of the cliff to rescue them, that he could disable a segment of the shield and then use an unknown metal as a conductor to open a door. He was apparently paid to set these rebels up, yet Finn and Rose only came up with the plan seconds ago. Then went looking for a different hacker. How could he possibly have known anything!28. The last Jedi? We have Leia, Ray and some random kid with force powers. And those are just the three we know about. Couldn't more be in hiding?",Null,0,0,15 December 2017
Steve Jobs," Two hours of shouting, watching parents fight and never any payoff.
","This film consists of four 30-minutes argument montages, all set right before a press launch. Apparently, every worm in the wood comes out just before he releases something which I have a very hard time believing to be true. Then its about the shouting match Steve has with five people as he moans, complains, gets angry and solves nothing. Seriously, only one of those arguments gets a form of resolution at the end and the other four are swept under the rug. And we never see any of the press conferences. Its like watching the build up to the show but never the show itself. We didn't need to see the full thing, just something that shows us viewers who are not familiar with the person, the conclusion to the story. If you have little to no knowledge about Steve Jobs, this film will not only be confusing but also get you hating the guy for things that were not really his fault. And it misses out a lot, his wife, children, the iphone, ipad, his illness and death. It really is just him shouting at people without context or any knowledge of the story in-between which gets him to that moment. For example, one minute he is going on stage to show the Mac, then the next scene we are backstage again with him having been fired about to present the NEXT computer. We find out through the arguing he was voted out, but we never see what caused it or the breakdown at work. I disliked this film, and it makes Ashton Kutchers version look like a masterpiece in comparison.",2,49,88,18 November 2015
Pitch Perfect 2," So much potential wasted
","It was a by-the-numbers story which we have all seen before. But that was not what disappointed me. No, I was disappointed in that all these acappella groups have backing instrument tracks. Even the commentator had to comment about how in his day, it was done differently. Because what they were doing was not acappella music. It was pop hit medleys. They have forgotten everything that was the magic of the first. Replacing strong vocals for circus skills, hula hoops, ribbon dancing and gymnastics. They were suppose to be an ACAPPELLA group! Some of the racist and sexist jokes were funny, but borderline if you consider its target audience. Even suggesting Beca was into girls was getting awkward. Then they have the scene where there all sleeping together and one of them starts licking the others nose, and we cut away... I think the writers got a little confused on what they were writing and who it was for.",2,32,70,19 July 2015
The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies," The Three Stooges meet WWE Wrestling
","This is a very long, drawn out battle scene that makes zero sense. It like watching the cut scenes from a video game at times. Their is no conclusion as the one thing everyone is fighting for is not left with anyone! Who has the heart of the mountain in the end? Who has the white gems? Who has the gold? Who controls the city? No-one knows?Where did the giant earth worms come from? Why didn't they dig straight under the armies or into the mountain itself?There are comical moments that feel like they should have been in a Three Stooges sketch followed by the worlds longest Royal Rumble match, only its held in the OWA where no-one knows any of the characters names, or cares. It has its moments and its action is intense and there is a lot of it. And this time round there are only five endings to sit through.",6,11,22,15 December 2014
Taken 2," Excellent Film - A joy to watch
","This film was fantastic. I loved the first film and it was a surprise breakout hit of the year. So when I heard a sequel was coming, I was there for the first showing in my local cinema. As a sequel - it did have a problem of trying to put these ordinary characters into an impossible situation yet again. The first time you could imagine the circumstances behind the kidnapping and relate to the idea that this happens in the real world and it was spot-lighting a true tragedy in the world today. As a sequel, it couldn't repeat any of that without it looking copied or forced into the plot. The writers had to find a way of bringing the same cast back while tying it into the events of the last film somehow. While they did this superbly, it has to be said that the 'this might happen to your daughter' angle that the first film gave is not present in this film. This is more of an action driven showcase which is about the world these characters have created for themselves, not one they have been thrust into. I was fine with this as it's a sequel - but some of the other reviewers on this site appear to have wanted a complete remake of the original - which this is most definitely not. It takes the elements that made the original outstanding and tries to build something new with them - which I applaud tremendously. The use of intelligent spy work is still present. The mixed fighting styles, gun fights, car chases etc all still there making this a great film. The only thing really missing was the tying up of the mum / dad getting back together storyline that they started at the beginning but abandoned when it could have been acknowledged with a simply kiss at the very end of the film. Because the first film showed us a new form of crime on the big screen that had not been explored before, and a whole criminal empire with a brand new action super spy to play with, it will forever be the best in the series - no matter how many sequels they make. But this film stands firmly up there with it as one of the best films of its year and you can be sure I will be first in line for the third film also when they undoubtedly make that also.This film is already in my top 10 of favourite films of all time and I thank everyone who had a hand in making it a success.",10,24,53,4 October 2012
Thor: The Dark World," A good entry into the Marvel Universe
","Having just watched a premier screening, I am delighted to come away from the cinema to write a positive review. Thor Dark World is a spectacular special effect driven film, much of which is set in Asguard.I was worried that including Loki yet again might become a little repetitive, but in this film he excels as a great character, I only hope however that they don't overdue his presence in the Marvel Universe. How many times can this guy come back from the dead?There isn't as much character development as the first film, and Thor's friends are nowhere near as interesting as the Avengers. I guess they simply needed these characters to all remain as they were so as to keep continuity within the Marvel universe, but its noticeable how little impact the storyline will have on anybody.The armies of Asguard were noticeably lacking in fire-power and weapons (even though they have an armoury), which is made even more evident when an entire guard division bring knives to a laser-gun fight. Their turrents were the only defense they had against an Ariel assault and proved to be practically useless. You would expect them to be better prepared.The healing powers of Thor, Jane, and even a smashed alien space-craft become a bit of a running joke as well. But at least they get hurt, even if it only takes them a scene to heal. And if smashing every column holding up a building is still not enough to take it down I'm not sure what will be. Christopher Eccleston played a competent bad guy, although his intentions for what he was doing was still unclear as to why. Its simple to say he was insane and just wanted to kill everybody, but when a threat of that magnitude appears and planetary alignments are in effect, you expect half the Universe to show up and stop him or take advantage of the situation, or come looking to take the power for themselves. I also expected to see the entire army of Asguard come to help out at the end like they apparently did in the past. Not just Thor who appears there by mistake.The scientist with the miraculous plot saving devise is also a little hard fetch to take in, especially when he creates a remote control for cosmic anomalies. Along with Loki's illusion power which also serves as a convenient plot-saving devise at times. I'm willing to overlook these but there's no denying what they are. Overall its a good enjoyable superhero movie, which you will want to watch several times and is a decent entry into the Marvel Universe.P.S. Watch it in 2D, The 3D added little of worth.",9,216,405,29 October 2013
Deadpool," Contender for film of the year.
","This is perhaps the ultimate superhero movie. Its got so much rewatch-ability factor its off the scale. There is a brief scene of sex and nudity, a few swear words but nothing too serious. Its got lots of killing but even more jokes. And jokes that work on every level. If the Martian can win a comedy award, this should take every award at the next Golden Globes and Oscars by miles. There is an after-credit scene, and its worth sticking around for. From the hilarious opening credits, to the references to both X-Men and Avengers films, its perfect. Colossus is finally given some okay CGI and actual has a decent role in the story. Its nice to see his character used properly for once. The girl has her uses, but is best used to bounce jokes off, just like the villains. But its ll good. It will be hard for any film to beat this for best film of 2016.",10,20,44,9 February 2016
