The Benchwarmers," really funny
","if your going to be like a lot of kids and say it sucked just because it had farting in it, your gay...basically... It was funny, bringing back some old school slapstick humor, but there is no reason you shouldn't like it if you liked movies like big daddy, saving Silverman, or dumb and dumber which are all classic crude comedy's. in my opinion , give this movie a chance.Now granted, if your not much of the one-liner guy, you might not enjoy this movie, but don't rat on in because you brought your family to see it and john heder picked his nose and farted thats stupid. John luvetz's character was really funny,so was john heder's. David Spade acting like always sarcastic David Spade, also never lets down with his million one-liners, but Rob's performance kind of disappointed me. He definitely got screwed on his script because he didn't not have a lot of funny things to say, but still entertaining, i recommend this movie.",6,0,5,8 April 2006
Hostel," Finnally a different ending
","everybody is retarded who said this ending sucked , i mean sure the part with the kids who jumped the car was a little crazy but come on, when he followed that guy into the bathroom, you know you were like this is going to be awesome, and it ended perfect with him looking at him right in the face. in EVERY horror movie the killer always wins in the end and its gay, its good to see something different. Even though there wasn't just one killer in hostel, the guy still killed the killer in his eyes (and i would like to think he goes back home and tells of whats going on there so it doesn't go unnoticed) but compared to every other horror movie, the has what others seldomly don't have. a plot.",5,1,3,9 January 2006
