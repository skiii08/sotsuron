Blade Runner 2049," Quest for Humanity
","I honestly never thought that my favorate film of all time would ever or even should get a sequel, but surprisingly sometimes their the best kind of sequels to spring up and I'm proud to say this is another one of my favorate films of all time that I put along with the first.There is just so much about this film that is great from the production value to cinematography which is just top notch where it's just a feast for the eyes. I love how the futuristic world isn't too different from the one were familiar with but it also expands upon it making this world broader than ever before. 
From some of the customs like we see there is this big vending wall where everyone like crazy just simply touches the screen to pick out what they want to eat and they get it, much like a food replecator in 'Star Trek'. This is kinda interesting because I noticed there are no restarurants or cafes anywhere in the city, which shows how those buisnesses have gone extinct like the drive in and video rental stores but also how overly dependant humanity has became on technology which makes this fact a bit sad. Even like that there is a update on the verbal command tech from the first film.Down to certain lands that K ventures to, one scene which is just beautiful where K is walking in the post apocalitic ruins of Las Vegas. It just has such an other worldly quality almost like he's traversing a Martian Landscape as we see the sand and even the sky is redish and some of the statues he's passing by are kinda strange; this scene alone proves that a revival film to 'Dune' (and possibly the whole book franchise) can be made. Seeing things like this made me wonder how much more was in this world and what happened to bring this world to where it is now. The music is just fantastic, the score is just memorable and really fits the film as it's a sort of futuristic noir. The film goes at a steady pace, it may seem a bit slow for some but you get use to it and it actually really helps making the film kinda on the meditative side. There is a bit of action which is well chorigraphed, it's not exactly wall to wall but that's because it's a bit more realistic which helps ground the film in reality.However were not in this for the action were in this for the mystery and the metadative extencial phylosophy. This truely is a thinking persons sci-fi which I always like as long as it holds my interest. The mystery is intreging which is this search for the identity of a replicant or hybrid child which is unusal because replicant's can't produce children until now. Though by it's nature that's just a motive device, the real mystery is K himself. This is probably my favorate role for Ryan Goslying, I really loved his character arc thoughout the film which corilates with one of themes of the film.His character's extensial dilemma parallels with Richard's in the past film. Just like Richard, K (which ironically is the initial for Killer as well as Philip's middle initial) is a Blade Runner a hit man/dectective whose job is to retire the old models for a hidden agenda by the corrupt company that has now monopolized the police force much like Omni Consumer Products from 'Robocop'. The guy really isn't his own person hense the fact he hardly has a name let alone a life as we see his apartment which is slightly sterile and bare, all he really has is his job which is really sad because it's a two dimentional existence.However what's interesting about him is he's a replicant or so he's lead to believe when he begans to uncover thoughout the film there might me more to him. Much like with Richard whom isn't sure if he's totally human. I really like how thoughout this film we're practically in the same boat as K as he is uncovering not just the facts to the mystery but constantly wondering about his own identity or even more of what it can be with his time with Joi.This soul search is part of what makes K become more human thoughout the film, because in a way that's what we all do everyday as time moves on we constantly wonder what more is their in our existence, is there more to ourselves, and can we be more?But to me the highlight is his interactions with his holographic partner/significant other Joi. Ana de Alma's is just excellent in the role, she the classic femine noir character as she radiates both physically and emotionally a lovely mysterious beauty. She also has the same extential dilemma; despite a hologram she is truly human because of what she feels and what more she wants to feel and discover for herself which to me is part of what being human is about.I really love the chemistry both of them have which I think is touching and lovely as we see her struggling to find way to become more human and get past her limitations which in a way goes with transcendence phylosphy which is about accending above our past limitations. There is a very interesting moment when she syncs with another woman in order to be able to make love to K, it's just a beautiful sequence but shows how far and close Joi has came to humanity.Harison Ford despite coming in around the third and final half is great as usual as Richard Deckard. Wherether Richard is a Replicant or not is still up in the air, though he's probably human due to living out as long as he has, unless he's a more advanced model that's programed with a longer life span. It doesn't mater, his character is still the same though a little on the grouchy side but due to what he's been though I don't blame him. But I like how we discover how far he's come especially which his relationship with Rachel which just shows how much he's transcended and has made both of them officially human.Humanity can never be retired.Rating: 4 stars",10,3,8,4 January 2018
Changeling," Long Lost Boy
","It's always one of the last things we would ever want to happen, but the terrible truth is this is something that could happen to anyone, and when it leaves a permanent scar. There are very few film that can make me cry and this is one of them, but also strangely this actually is one of my favorite films from Clint Eastwood.Not a whole lot I can really say, I like the production value capturing 1920's America a decade long gone. From the wardrobe, cars, customs, everything. I really like the music score which has a somber and almost haunting tune to it. The writing is great the fact that it's by my favorite comic book/script write J. Michael Straczyski whom is known for the 'Superman: Year One' graphic comic series is fantastic, it would be cool if he did scripts for movies a bit more often.Supporting character Rev. Gustav played well by John Malkovich (TV's 'Crossbones') its to me is one of his better roles. He's pretty much a radical/activist that is helping out Christine in finding her son by rooting out the corruption going on in the LAPD. He's also kinda funny he has some charisma in some scenes.Howvever to me it's Angelina Jolie (Malificant) whom is one of my favorite actresses that really carries the movie, this to me is one of my favorite roles from her. She does a great job at portraying Christine Collins whom is simply an ordinary working class woman from a period long gone. Her character you just feel deep pathos for as she is constantly and desperately trying to seek help in finding her lost son.You really can feel her pain from what's in her eyes and all the crap she is just going though, let alone getting crap canned from the precent she asked for help from. You really feel angry at the pricent which isn't doing there job and seem to be more busy at trying to keep their hands clean, but their hands to me look plenty dirty to me; and for the record I fraking hate crooked cops.The scene when Christine says 'I want my son back.' that always breaks my heart a bit whenever I heard that. But one scene that really broke my heart was when Christine was passing by the school again after the crap she went through in the psych ward she was illegally sent to. Just the look on her face and seeing the school it just put tears in my eyes and made me cry, knowing that her son use to go to that school and the fact she passing by it shows how far and lost her son may'be.Police must always protect and serve the law and people, but must never abuse the power behind their badge to their own uses. What that precent did to Christine wasn't right, and your glad near the end that their finally paying the price. However the real heart breaker is the last facts of the case in the end, which put tears in my eyes.We'll never forget about her son and the many other children out there still missing.Rating: 4 stars",10,1,2,16 June 2014
Gremlins," Monster Christmas Party
","As much as like the cheerful kind of Christmas films, personally I'm more fascinated with those bizarre ones that really put the yang in the holiday. This film though is what started that trend for me, I've seen this film when I was 7, I loved it then and I love it now it's not just one of my favorite Chirstmas films but one of my favorite films of all time.I really love the story which I'll admit is a very unusual and really daring idea for a Christmas film but it really worked and I loved it because it was just a change of pace for me. For it's time mixing horror and Christmas was really unheard of (it's still rarely done to this day), but it turned out to be a great combo where it not just delivers some frights but also smiles and managed to still emit that warm Christmas feel if you can believe that. Production value is excellent done on a big budget but used correctly, The creature effects are fantastic because their all practical, there is no CGI bull crap. The designs of both the Mogwai and Gremlins are great, they look like animals they could exist in our modern world. And the animatronics and pupetering is perfect, from their facial expressions giving each of them a persona and their movements.The voice acting for the creatures is amazing. From comedian Howie Mandel for Gizmo which is just spot on because each sound just sprouts cuteness, of course he used some of those same tones for his voice acting role for Bobby in the animated show 'Booby's World' (another cute little guy). And of course Frank Wekler as the Gremlin Stripe is just fantastic, Frank Wekler is my favorite voice actor this guy is just a chameleon of voices, let alone the fact that I'm a 'Transformers' fan and on a side note Peter Culen another 'Transformers' alumi also does voice work as one of the Gremlins so that's cool. But Frank's voice also fits like a glove for this character as it just emits menace, mischievousness, and nastiness.I really like the small town they use because it just has that sense of familiarity, I myself have lived and grew up in places like Kingston Falls. And the music is great as it's by one of my favorite movie composers Jerry Goldsmith, that theme song is one of my favorite themes of all time.The characters are great from the creatures like Gizmo whom is just cute both physically but mainly in personality, you just want to hug and keep the little guy close. His character is a bit mischievous but has just this unending innocence as he just wants to have fun. Really love how he is fascinated and slightly influence by pop culture which makes the creature relatable because that's like with any of us: as we see him watch some racing film staring Clark Gable that really gets Gizmo interested in driving a car of his own which he of course does near the end.Stripe and the Gremlins, their one of my favorite fictional villains and monsters. Their just fun villains because despite how much trouble and chaos they cause which is what they practically thrive on they just love to have fun. From scarfing down food and candy, playing video games, to watching Snow White. This sort of gives the Gremlins a bit of relatablity because these are the kind of things we love doing the most with our lives.However what also drives the movie are the human characters, their actually well rounded and a bit three dimensional which makes us care for them and feel like what they do and go though in this ordeal matters.Billy's dad is great, his character may have been a partial influence for Steve Urkel as he is an inventor but unfortunately not a very successful one because despite how creative his inventions are they don't work. But that never gets him down, he keeps trying because he passionate about his role it's one of the things he does best in life.Kate is also great, I'll admit I had a crush on actress Pheobe Cates when I was a kid. She's that girl next door kind of person, whom is sweet but also really sympathetic because she isn't having the easiest time as she is struggling both professionally and personally.But of course my favorite human character is Billy, I really like this protagonist because I can really relate to the guy. We see he's doesn't really have all the breaks but he has big dreams, as he is an artist he is constantly drawing and he's a fan of graphic novels/comic books, it's like with me I'm into comic books/graphic novels also and I constantly write. So he's hopping to be a comic book artist or in some profession where he can do one of the things he does best in life to be somebody, all he needs is a chance to find a way to step up. You can say the predicament he's in is that chance in one hell of a way, because we see him actually stepping up becoming somebody a hero.There are lots of great scenes, one favorite scene of mine which is Billy's mom confortation with the Gremlins which I thought was suspenseful fun and of course it had my favorite Gremlin kill which was death by Microwave, it was gross but cool seeing the Gremlin just explode like bad leftovers. That bar room scene which is hilarious because it plays out like a giant Mad Magazine or Where's Waldo comic illustration.So if your a horror fan and love Christmas then this is your party, and happy holidays.Rating: 4 stars",10,0,1,14 December 2015
United 93," Darkest Day
","For me it all started with silent discovery, I'll never forget the sick sinking feeling I had when I saw the broadcast on one of th towers that were just hit, and that sinking feeling kept going down more and more as the situation developed and got worse, at the time I knew that something terrible in human history has occurred and nothing will ever be the same again. Is it too soon to make a movie about this someone once said, my personal opinion no it's not because we must honor and ever forget it.The film was all honest and real like were actually seeing a documentary. Everything in it takes place in real time and really gives you that feeling like your right there as everything is slowly but surely unfolding. We see the frantic pacing and struggle as controllers to get things under control which most of it turns out to be fruitless as things are falling apart. But most of all further in the movie we are totally involved with what is currently happening in United 93 as the terrorists start making their move.It was a great idea that unknowns were used in the film some of them were experienced actors that you might have seen on TV or films. And most of there aren't even actors. Everyone looks like ordinary regular people and that helps because everyone in that flight were ordinary people like yo and me. The terrorists in the film, what makes them frightening is how human they seem, their scared and hesitant in what their about to do but know they have to do it, these people really believe in what their doing but it's a blind devotion and through their eyes their completely devoid of human soul; much like how cult members in Jonestown followed a false religion to the bitter end. Do I hate them, I won't answer that because I can only truly hate a person for trespasses committed against me or others that are innocent that I know or don't know, but what these guys did is completely unforgivable in my book.As we see the ongoing action we feel may things as things start to happen; Fear, shock, anger, dread, and sadness which was everything I felt from the first discovery. The them in the film is not just about remembering what happened but about true heroism in the face of danger. There are two forms of heroism shown both silent and aggressive. The passengers, we don't really get to know but through their actions that most of them are putting into action with silent ingenuity opening lines of communicating by using the airline phones. We see them constantly calling their relatives or anyone else to relay news about what is going on and started to realize something must be done and now. And so we see everyone getting together, organizing a group, orient themselves in the very little time they have, and come up with a quick plan of attack. We see even more acts of silent heroism one woman passes out of the eye of one of the terrorists a phone to a fellow passenger so the passenger can call her family. another is when one passenger runs quickly toward a bathroom stall to call 911. Their doing these things because their the only things they can do for survival and know there is a possibility they might not get through it they at least have to try. Those scenes when we heard the passengers talk to their families and friends telling them good bye and that they love them, made my heart bleed.At the end I couldn't help but cry, feeling that sense of powerlessness knowing I couldn't help them or why they couldn't survive.Rating: 4 stars",10,1,2,12 November 2012
Gravity," Hang On
","We always carry certain fears within our subconscious every day; the possibility that may'be we left the stove on, coffee maker on, didn't lock the door, lost our homework, or any other worst case scenario you can think of. These are things that rarely and don't usual happen to most to all people. But there is always that looming dread that it still can and the dark truth is sometimes it actually does.This is one of the best suspense films I've ever seen, because this is a worst case scenario that takes place in space. Which I think is really cool because most suspense thrillers are always earth based. It's an uncomplicated and simple plot which makes this all the better, personally I getting kinda bored of most thrillers trying to be too complicated for their own good, all thought but no thrills. And the plot feels plausible, whose to say this can't happen.The effects are just fantastic, I really love how space looks in this film it really looks like real space. And it's all reinforced by some of the excellent cinematography, I really love how it weaved around in certain places gave everything almost a certain sense of geography. Even at times there was some first person perspective shots which really gave a great sense of being in the astronaut's point of view but most importantly helped really put you in the action. And they also created the illusion of gravity well, the physical chirography and visual effects were on the mark that you'd almost think the film really was shot up in space, because they really nailed the physics of space perfectly.Even the score was excellent it was thrilling and epic. On further note I saw this film in 3D and the 3D in this film is just fantastic, it really gave you the illusion that you were up there and in on the action, at times when the debris came I couldn't help but duck in my seat it looked like they were coming at me.But most importantly the suspense in the film was excellent. This film goes at a fast pace , things are just constantly happening that there's almost no time to take a breath. The acting is solid, George Clooney does well with what he has but to me it was really Sandra Bullock that drove this film let alone she is the main protagonist. I really liked both her emotional and physical performance how her character reacts in the film, it felt like how anyone else might react and feel if even in this type of uncontrollable situation; constantly trying to keep functioning and working despite losing most of your cool.I'll admit I couldn't help but worry for her life as both time and physics were against her. As at times she has to get from point A to B safely without loosing control of her body. Or even simply trying to get hit or knocked away from the debris that zip as fast as bullets and can cut through things like razors. Just any other obstacle that makes things worse than they already are, as a saying goes out of the frying pan into the fire.Gravity is a thrill ride worth hanging on to.Rating: 4 stars",10,2,3,21 October 2013
This Is the End," Apocalipse Now
","There are a lot of things I can think of doing if the coming apocalypse occurs, staying with my best friends, staying with my girlfriend, or if single find ask out a celebrity on a date (yeah I know long shot but hey, end of days is coming doesn't hurt to try) but holing up with these characters under the same roof is not one of them.I do like the idea, in a way it's the kind of idea we all might have on the possibility of the worst coming, why not hole up with people you like/love. This is sort of that idea only problem is some of these characters don't exactly like or love each other back which makes it all the more funny because this is also one of the last things you would want to happen.There are some good gore even CGI effects; OK, not all CGI was good but I think that just added to the humor. But really were in this film for the group of six and what they do during the apocalypse, this kind of comedy really wouldn't of worked if it wasn't for the ensemble which consists of Seth Rogen, Jay Barshel, Danny McBride, James Franco, Craig Robertson, and Jonah Hill whom all play themselves well sort of.What makes all six of them funny is how they react or handle a rather bizarre and logically ridiculous situation, one of my favorite moments is how their struggling to ration the food, water, and supplies. Or another making a home video sequel to Pinapple Express out of boredom, which is funny because it sort of reminds me of the same ploy in the film 'Be Kind Rewind' but just the mere ironic fact that four of the cast members Seth, Franco, Craig, and Danny were all in that film. And of course the video journals they make which are also funny because of the honesty or dishonesty they express. Also the fact that each of the actors are playing themselves or at least contrary versions of themselves. In a way each of them aren't parodying themselves but actually more satirizing on their fame and identities to the public eye. It's not a easy rope to walk, satirizing on yourself but at the same time playing yourself in small doses. It's sort of the satire on what we don't see a celebrity say or do when out of the public eye, it's a bit funny because it's true sometimes that one celebrity might act nice when in reality he or she isn't. As a saying goes reality is a whole different story indeed.There is some physical humor but it's powered more by verbal humor and this film has some dialog that is just hilarious. Most of what the characters say will make you laugh your head of and may'be even grown a bit at the same time. Though at times some of it is funny because there are some parts of the verbal humor that could be true, and really made me think if this is what this person or that person was thinking or feeling in their time in Hollywood; or likewise what we think of them.There are cameo appearances where even they play contrary to themselves, seeing what they do and what happens to most or all of them. Though my favorite cameo no doubt is Emma Watson whom is hot as usual. Her appearance is funny because she seems really out of place in the film it's not the type you'd actually see her in and that's the point, as if it's an actor/actress in a project for the paycheck despite how ridiculous or bad it is.But what she does at the end made me crack up and turn me on at the same time. Why the hell her character didn't get transported to heaven is anyone's guess but that's just how the story went and on a side note I'd go with her if it's the end of days.The pace and the humor never lets up, due to how things just escalate and get worse or should I say more ridiculous by the minute for the six. All six just get funnier and may'be even a little crazier. But let alone the fact this film takes place in one spot throughout most to all the film, much like a bottle episode in a TV show; I always liked them because they were usually about characters in one spot arguing and working out differences. There are times when it's almost touching (I said almost)as we see some of them bonding mainly Seth, Josh, and Craig. But also work out issues weather they like it or not, but then again in the forth coming apocalypse what the heck else are you going to do.Overall, 'This is the End' is absurd fun which is funny to the end.Rating: 3 and a half stars",9,4,9,23 June 2013
Argo," The Great Escape
","Suspense thrillers most of the time work for me because the protagonist most of the time are forced to think outside of the box, which is part of why the bad guys lose because they never expect such an unconventional but well thought out move. Ben Afleck is one of my favorite actors and is really on track to becoming one of my favorite directors, out of the films he's made so far this is probably my favorite of his. This film is one of my favorite suspense thriller and what makes it great and all the more suspenseful is the fact it's based on something that actually happened.I really like most of the accuracy of the film, it captured the look and feel of the transitional period of 1979-1980. From fashions, hair styles, cars, some old news clips you name it it's all there. This helped in successfully portraying the situation of civil unrest going on in Iran and the hostage crisis going on. But also most of what happened in the film did happen, in the end credits we see comparison with real life photos and scenes in the film.The characters all are good. I really liked Ben Affleck as Tony Mendez, I love the fact he's not portrayed as some cliché stereotypical straight laced C.I.A. agent but just an ordinary guy that is best at his job of extracting people from nervous situations. You really get a good feel for him, as he is on mission you can tell behind the eyes he struggles to keep cool and is constantly concerned for the six people and if he really can pull this scheme off. I really like the fake movie cover scam Tony cooked up, which I personally felt was a great idea. It was unconventional, creative, plausible, most importantly actually worked. Let alone the fact the fake movie is a sci-fi and I'm a huge fan of that genre which made the scam all the more cooler.Bryan Cranston is great as Jack O Donnell. I like that he's not some cliché blowhole boss which I am personally sick of (honestly they can't be nice) but is actually a boss that is on the main protagonists side and a friend.Alan Arkin as movie producer Lester Siegel and John Goodman as the late great makeup artist John Chambers are both great, they both helped make the scam a reality but I just love the fact both are selfless, their simply taking an opportunity to save lives which I feel is what any good person should do. I even like that there is some humor with them, Alan Arkin's character has some really funny lines like 'If I want to make a fake movie I want it to be a fake hit.' I felt that was kinda funny because he's right, one of the best methods of hiding is to be in plan sight.Even like the six house guests which we don't know deeply but you do get a good feel for them which made them all the more sympathetic. Their all tired, on edge, just want to go home. I even like little moments like one of them has a little monologue where he regrets his dession to stay and should've listened to his wife at that time. That kinda thing I can sort of emphasize with, where in the aftermath of something you think back and realize if you did this or that at that time then you wouldn't be where you are now.However for me what really made the film was in the suspense and story. I wouldn't say it's so much edge of your seat because you already know the ending of the film, but it's nerve racking because you wondering how. The pacing is good, it's not boring, I like some of the technicalities to make the scam work and most importantly you are constantly concerned about Tony and the six as they are going though the motions and taking action. There are some moments that make things nervous and kinda scary, like the security checkpoints they have to go though, driving though angry protesters. But also how there are scenes where we see some organization is slowly but surely putting together to pieces of the shredded mug list, this is sort of the time limit element we know once they complete the mugs of the six missing then they'll catch wind of the scam which is something were constantly hopping won't happen.Overall this is a great film, Argo is an escapist journey.Rating: 4 stars",10,5,11,27 February 2013
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," The Full Length Crazy Town Adventure
","When it comes to most movies based off of TV shows it's always kind of hit or miss for me; This film is another one of the good ones in my book because like any TV to movie adaptation it obeys the three most important cardinal rules one staying true to it's source so that it has the same spirit, two having a good story to stand on it's own, but also and it's purely optional three which is continuing off sometime in the show to keep the story of the show going. I really love how the film just like the TV show as usual wickedly and vulgar satires/parodies on the issue of the subculture of censorship and how ridiculous and stupid it truly is. But how it's easy to play scapegoat to avoid dealing with the true source of the problem or simply issues that really do matter.The characters are as usual themselves and at there best in the film and each one has something to do, so it's well balanced no one is short ended.
We also see villains like Satan once again though in this film he's not much of a villain which I like that's something different. Here he's a sensitive guy that has wants and needs that haven't been meet yet, and unfortunately is letting himself be mislead into attaining them the wrong way. However, to me the real villain in this film is Shella whom once again blows things out of proportion or should I say nukes em and she is playing the blame game on visual media. Her intentions aren't evil as she wants to create a safe place for everyone but what she's doing is wrong and as the old universal saying, 'The road to Hell is paved with good intentions.' She is so driven by her inhibitions that she can't see the corrupt nature of her actions and the deadly consequences it has produced in the film.I also really like the subplot with Stan Marsh whom is trying to find a way to win over Wendy Testburger's heart. I know it's a typical one for Stan if you watched the show enough but personally I always like those storylines, because I always like seeing both Stan and Wendy together. Though I'll admit seeing this really makes me sorely miss episodes with those two as they've been sorely lacking in the recent seasons of the show.But the real highlight is in the music is just great there are a lot of memorable songs that I both laugh and dance to and replay on my CD or iPod; I wouldn't say all the songs are hits but that's always the case with most to all musicals as by their nature an anthology of songs, so there will be hits and misses all around. But it's always the hits that count. I'll just say a few of my favorites.Kyle's Mom: Ok, I know this song was in the show, but I really like the updated version of it as it's added some new things to it that actually made it even funnier. And it's fitting since she's the villain of the film and from what she does this is the rare time I actually agree with Cartman.Blame Canada: This is my favorite song in the film, it's a song basically on wrongful blame and is practically the epidemy of any organizations stupidity against any kind of free expression, speech and entertainment. But it's strangely exciting and hilarious at the same time.La Resistance: This is my second favorite song in the film which is funny but also strangely exciting, as we're seeing everyone getting ready to fight in a stupid war. Which in a way makes it a bit of a commentary as most wars are fought because of stupid reasons?Small Mountain Town: This is my third favorite song as it's funny but strangely nice it really does give me a good feeling every time I hear it; the song just perfectly sums up what South Park is.Though I have to warn you, like with most movies based off of TV shows it might not be everyone's cup of tea unless you've had a sip of it before; if you're a fan of the TV show then this film won't disappoint you. 
A lot of wild and crazy things can happen in a small mountain town.Rating: 4 stars",10,0,0,4 July 2018
Ed Wood," Imperfect Ambitious Visionary
","Out of all the movie's from one of my favorite directors strangely this turned out to be my favorite one but most importantly one of my favorite films in general. This is strange to me because normally I'm not really into biopics, but this is probably one of the only ones I really like because not just was the guy in my favorite field of expertize but his story was actually interesting.The cinematography was excellent, I'm glad it was all done in black and white it really helped capture the time when Hollywood was still young and it's sub culture was on the rise. I even like the music score by Howard Shore which also fits with the movie.But most importantly I like how the real life characters were portrayed and performed. Ed Wood is my favorite role from one of my favorite actors Johnny Depp. Johnny really captured his spirit at least before the time things for Ed went down south. But what I really like about Ed is that you are on his side from beginning to end because you can easily emphasize. The guy was an underdog he was really down on his luck and constantly struggling to make his dreams come true. Most of the people that try to bring him down or discourage him are all rational people, and you don't like them because their total blow holes; I remember always thinking 'Cmon just let him do his own thing.' And that was a good feeling, a feeling I don't get much for character real or unreal.Yes, it true that Ed is a hack and a flaw person, from writing scripts that have some really bad dialog down to being delusional and eccentric, but he was actually honest about it you actually see him putting it out there, like in one scene he wears a dress while directing a scene for 'Plan 9' as a way to feel good, in a way it sort of reminds me of the common idocricies we would do to help ourselves think or feel something like I've seen some girls in my collage classes that would draw or write some things on the sides before taking notes, not kidding.And he saw let alone worked on his films and there were lots of mistakes from bad production quality, bad context, acting, and other things. But it never discouraged him, he had a vision and was relentlessly determined to keep on building it and after it was done in his eyes the final product was perfect even though reality said something else.But of course it was also Martin Landau's performance as Bela Lagosi that also carried out the film, this is my favorite role from that actor because you really believe your seeing and hearing Bela. Seeing the twilight times of this actor I'll admit is really sad and made me wonder about a lot of others actors and actresses out there whom are now out of the limelight. You really felt for the guy from beginning to end, from his desire to continue acting which is one think I admired despite how old he is he could still do it let alone acting is what made sense to his life. Down to the time in the film he passed away which made me shed tears, I know this was something that happen long ago but they way they build it up gripped at emotions.The real life supporting characters are great, my favorite one is Bunny Beckaridge by one of my favorite comedian actors Bill Murray, what he says at the Babtism always cracked me up.I really like the humor in the film, it's true this film is a biopic drama but it's not oh so serious which I feel is a tone that fits perfectly and makes the characters feel more human. My favorite humorous moment is when Ed and the gang go to the movie premiere of 'Bride of the Monster' and everyone is booing, throwing popcorn, it's crazy though the strangest thing about that scene is their doing this when the movie is just starting. I have only two conclusions about this, one this could of been a simple technical mistake or the theater is just reshowing the movie, though if that was the case why the heck would anyone stay).I really love this film because it really is an inspiring movie because it really has a good lesson on simply fighting for your dream. Ed didn't do it for money or glory (theoretically anyway) which I never found good reasons to do filmmaking for; he did it really just to be and do what he wanted to do because it made sense for his life. That the same for all of us for whatever we do or desire.Visions really are worth fighting for.Rating: 4 stars",10,1,1,16 May 2012
Home Alone," Home for the Holidays
","This is one of my favorite movies of all time as well as one of my favorite Christmas films.It's also another one of my childhood gems, it's was just so much fun for so many reasons but also heartfelt at the same time. I really like the plotline as it's sort of a wishfulment fantasy being the man or woman of the house and just having complete freedom to do whatever you want and make your own rules.There is so much to like, from the production value, which is great, really like how the traps were set up and conducted. Even the music is great, from some soundtrack bits but it's really the score by one of my favorite composers John Williams which makes it the most memorable. From that theme song which is one of my favorite themes of all time, as it has both a Christmas tune but at the same time a sense of foreboding as it reminds us as fun and cheerful as the film is there is still trouble in paradise. But another tune which is 'All of my Memories' is just beautiful and perfectly reflects the theme of the film.I really like the characters, from the Wet Bandits Harry and Marv played well by Joe Pechi and Daniel Stern. Both your classic comic duo much like Abbot and Costello and any other you can think about, both are so much fun as both are pretty much numb skulls.Well Harry is more the smart one of the bunch as it seems like he the only one that really supplies the brain power of their schemes. However, this guy is no genius as his Achilles heel is that he's arrogant thinking he's so clever and listens too much to his own greed which we know both these things can make people stupid or do some stupid crap.Marv is pretty much Harry's flunky as he's dumb. But what makes him really funny is how he's a bit of a man child sometimes, like having these delusions of grangur in being one of the most famous criminals in history by leaving the water running as their calling card as 'The Wet Bandits', despite the fact he clearly needs a reality check as he's just increased their chances of getting caught and identified. But I really love some of his lines, he's got some great lines, one of my favorites 'he sounded like a snake' I know a small line but it's funny on two counts.But of course, my favorite character is the main protagonist Kevin McCallister played well by Macaulay Culkin. I really like that he's not some stereotypical annoying all smiles kid. Kevin really felt like a real kid whom is a relatable character as some of what he's gone though is some of the things that we may have experienced a time or two in our lives when we were kids.It's interesting what kind of household he lives in which must be the busiest household I've ever seen as it seems populated with twenty plus people. I remember whenever I watch the film, I always wonder who that person or the other in the family is. I honestly wouldn't mind if they made some sort of TV program (on a premium channel) called 'The McCallister's' where we could see Kevin and the rest of the family years later, get to know the rest of them and see what shanagans they get into. If not there's always a licensed comic book, follow up; and if one or both these happened it would be the true third sequel. Well, it's a nice thought anyway.Alright back to Kevin, he's charismatic, has some of the best lines in the film. My favorite from him is 'This is it, don't get scared now' yeah that's the kind of line I use whenever there is a final battle in certain Horror movies or survival horror video games. The film is almost at times like a one man play sometimes as in most scenes Kevin has only himself to talk to, but he does it so well because he's got a lot of interesting things to say.I really love how smart he is, this guy you could say could almost be a genius as he's a tactician, from building those elaborate traps. However, he is still naive like a child which increases the relatability factor as we've been through that. Like one of my favorite scenes is seeing Kevin dig though Buzz's trunk and he first looks though a Playboy magazine and says one really funny line that cracked me up 'No clothes on anyone sickening', yeah that what most of us and myself felt at Kevin's age.However, the one thing about him that makes him the most enduring is he is highly sympathetic. He has a big family but he is the only one that is the most underappreciated, doesn't really get much attention nor help when he needs and asks for it, none of the breaks and for some fraked up reason seems to be the target of ridicule for most family members, seriously what the frak is everyone's problem.Like in one scene he is trying to ask some people to help him pack a suitcase as he's never done it before, which is understandable because he's still really little which means there are a lot of things, he's never done himself before. But of course no one is or wants to help him do it, seriously not one member could take five to ten minutes of their life to show/help him pack, it wouldn't of killed them instead they act like they have more important things to do which they don't.The worst of all is Buzz, this is a guy you sort of love to hate as he's kind of funny or even just plain hate as he really presses a wrong button with you. What I really don't like about the guy is that he's is just so full of crap; from that story he tells both Kevin and another brother about a neighbor you just see as he's telling that he has a crap eating grin on his face, so you know the story is bull crap just to get cheap amusement. And another which was eating Kevin's Cheese Pizza on purpose and insulting Kevin once more, thinking he's so funny which pushes Kevin over the edge.I really love that Kevin retaliated, I'd do the same thing any bully that ever takes away my Cheese Pizza or even video game playing are going to meet Goku and Vegetta (my left and right fists); I know that sounds bold but human right need to be defended.Sadly, Kevin unfortunately get punished for something that wasn't his fault, let alone doesn't even have dinner. But the last part of that scene are really sad when instead of the mom talking and exercising understanding with Kevin to hear what really happened, she just retorts in a mocking and insulting tone, which I thought was uncool, I guess she forgot the old saying 'if you have nothing nice to say, don't say anything at all' At that moment I just knew that was the final straw and Karma was about to come down on the family hard.There are so many great and memorable scenes and moments throughout the film, so there is hardly a dull moment.One of my favorite scenes no doubt is when Kevin is watching a gangster pic and of course he's eating probably the biggest ice cream sundae I've ever seen, man I can never eat that many scoops. That film he watches is great, I honestly thought that was a real movie but no it's not. This is something as kids we always dreamed about which was to see Rated R films without restrictions.I just love the exaggerated nature of the film as we see the lead gangster Johnny solve his dilemma with a Tommy Gun (yeah that does work every time in those pics) and he just says one of my favorite movie quotes that cracked me up, 'Keep the change you filthy animal.' But I really like Kevin's reaction to that film as he's closing his eyes despite the fact there is no gore or squib effects. But for a kid his age that would be considered graphically violent and not something he's totally used to seeing. And this joke with the gangster movie gets funnier as we see it used in two different scenes in two different ways.And of course, there is the famous big battle near the end of the film which is in my book one of my favorite battles of all time. It's basically a home invasion battle which I think is cool because it's sort of like a strategy game battle, since the battle takes place on your own turf it makes you the general, giving you plenty of opportunities to tactically take out invaders whichever area they occupy. But of course, it's pretty much a slap stick/ physical comedy fest as we see the Wet Bandits constantly getting hurt by Kevin's traps and miraculously surviving, this was just hilarity at it's best, it made me laugh till it hurt.I'll just say a couple of my favorites as I don't want to give too much away, from the first scene seeing Kevin use the BB gun on both robbers, it's just funny how Harry reacts to the pain and he is just saying a bunch of gibberish in frustration.Another of course is the nail trap, it's funny because of just the delayed reaction as it pain doesn't even register until a little latter and I just laughed along the way.However, despite all the fun of the film this film has heart as the revolving theme is about appreciating family. There is one scene I found sad when Kevin is looking at a family whom is home for the holiday's enjoying Christmas, he has a sad look on his face, which I'll admit put a tear in my eye. That scene shows what Kevin truly wanted which was simply to have Christmas with his family. Or even some bits with the family feeling guilt over the loss of Kevin from the mom evaluating her own parenting and a member or two not enjoying their time in Paris as they know in their hearts it's not a real vacation as their family is incomplete.This just makes the pay off even sweeter, I'll just say both Kevin and the Macalister's get what they want for Christmas. No one is ever alone for the holidays as long as there are still people that love you.Rating: 4 stars",10,3,4,28 November 2019
Ready Player One," VR Troopers
","The world of reality and imagination can sometimes be a razors edge line we walk on. Everyday as we go out to reality we always find ways to escape reality for mere moments from putting on a VR set or just simply daydreaming. However, in those times as we imagine or experience ourselves doing something else and being someone else, it tends to corollate with our dreams of what we want in our reality and somehow finding the way to one day make our dreams come true. Steven Spielberg another one of my favorite movie directors (no surprise) believe it or not this is my forth favorite film from but also one of my favorite movies in general. Anyway, down to business this film just like the book to me is a dream come true, it is both a love letter to Gamers and fans of pop culture but also a story from all it's visual icing has a heart.The visual effects are just fantastic, I really love the look of the Oasis it is just a visual feast for the eyes, the whole place is sort of the ultimate open world video game. From the amount of color, character animation, structures, you name it, it really is a place the blurs the line as it looks both real and unreal. It's the kind of place I'd love to one day visit as you can pretty much do, go anywhere, and be anything you want; I could make my own avatar or even use the avatar image of 'Robocop' or 'Judge Dredd' and I could go shoot down some evil yoma with Sailor Mars and the Sailor Senchi; well you get the drift of it anything you want to do, do it.I also like the dystopian futuristic world that is conceived which I feel is plausible, as we see the real world is practically a scrapyard of itself. There is defiantly an overpopulation problem which has caused a spacing issue as we see most people whom have not much money are forced to live in this trailer park called the Stacks which are literally stacks of trailers on top of each other much like with the mega blocks in 'Judge Dredd' only no one is living in a super-sized condo. But what makes the world even more dreary is how a corporation can literally become a tyrannical force, the corporation in this film is much like 'OCP' in 'Robocop' as it literally has a stranglehold over most of the worlds resources and functions, including the technology we possess and livelihood. However, the most disturbing aspect to me of this corporation is how they have this VR cube structures where they imprison people that owe the company some dealt and make them work it out, which they never will because the company keeps increasing it just, so we make less to no money and they make more; it's literally Slavery. It just shows how evil this corporation is as it's flushed all it's sense of morality and humanity down the toilet, just to continue making fast profits while feeding on people's misery.There are tons of references, this film is just jammed full of them it would take more than one watch just to get them all. For anyone that is expensed in pop culture you will easily spot and get them which is endearing. Though the film is also kind of educational for rookies to pop culture that never heard about films like 'Back to the Future' or video games like 'Adventure', seeing those things in this film will cause them to research or simply try them out. The action and adventure are great, it goes at a good pace. From that race which is cool, where you get to drive any car of your choice or creation. With Percival it was the DeLorean from 'Back to the Future', me if I was ever in that game it would be the Batmobile from the 1989 film. The final battle sequence is awesome, it's probably my honorable mention of favorite battles of all time. It's literally like a live action 'Where's Waldo' art illustration as there are so many colorful avatars, some you would easily recognize, even certain weapons like one which got the big cheer, I won't say what it is but if you know your fantasy films from the 80's you know what weapon is referred to.The scavenger hunt which is thought provoking, each of the challenges are a riddle. The riddles are tricky as they contain hidden meanings in the words and red herrings to throw players off. But like most riddles the solution is simple it just doesn't seem that way at first, and you can solve them yourself if you know your nostalgia history and relics but also listened to most of Halliday's history carefully.The characters are solid, from the villains Sorrento (Ben Mendelsoln) he's a good villain, he's pretty much a unlikable corporate scumbag that doesn't give a toss about anyone except his own money and power which he has more than enough of. But like all greedy bastards more just isn't enough, this guy wants absolute power and he'll do anything to get it and maintain his stranglehold over the world. One thing about him is how he tries real hard at passing himself off as cool but isn't. Despite all the luxury he has like that big chair, in a big office space he really is nothing but the suit he puts on everyday. One scene that was interesting was when he was trying to get Perceval/Wade to work for him, as he's doing this he is trying to make references but it's not his own words it's the words of one of his sell out nerds that work for him. It just shows this guy is a real poser he's probably never even seen a John Hughes movie or played the video game 'Robotron'. Let alone intellectually bankrupt as he must have a whole division of nerds and geeks solve the riddles and play the game for him, which isn't fair.The subordinate villainess F'Nale Zandor is also good. The actress Hannah John-Karmen is hot, she is pretty much is the living embodiment of corporate b.... She is kind of his muscle/go two person as she wants to win at all costs even if it means breaking the law.And of course, we have the good guys the VR Troopers. The supporting heroes Acha/Helen, Sho, Daito are decent, we get a bit of a good feel for them they have unique personas, a good back and forth but they really help.But the two characters that really stand out are Perceval/Wade and Artimis/Samantha. Both are cool characters they have good personas from Perceval/Wade whom I can relate to because he's a bit like myself as he's a causal geek that loves gaming and pop culture from the past to present. He's sort of on the shy side as he not one of the popular people not even in the VR world and is attracted to girls that seem unattainable, but despite that fact he does try anyway if not successful at first.Olivia Cookie as Artimis/Samantha I think is lovely inside and out, as she really has some fire and feistiness. But I really like her sense of maturity and selflessness as she is determined to win the game for a noble cause. But also helps slowly but surely open Wade's eyes to not just reality but herself.
 I really like the chemistry between both as there are sparks flying that is starting to build a small fire. The back and forth between them is fun and touching. I really liked that dance sequence in that hover dance club which was fun, but it was really when both meet up and interact in the real world is where this chemistry really crackles. The Achilles heel both had were that they we both insecure about their looks and what the other would think of once they saw each other in real life. But once both do they aren't disappointed by what they see, sure they may not look oh so perfect the avatars they run but when they see each other it's at least real. Wade sees one physical feature that sort of makes Samantha an outcast and it's the birthmark on her face, but it doesn't bother Wade in fact he doesn't even care about it because he had feelings for her for who she is on the inside, it didn't matter what she looked like to him, she really looks lovely all the same; likewise, for Samantha as she sees Wade looks like any ordinary teen. But also, both along with their supporting characters are all underdogs, all of them have had pretty much been crapped on by the corporation and life. The corporation has had more then they need while all of them bare have much to anything, which more makes me want this team to win because they deserve it and their motives are genuine they want to not just make their own lives better but the existence they inhabit.The film does have some good messages, from the importance of fandom and pop culture but also not to let video games and technology be your whole life, their ok occasionally, but you also got to know when to unplug and tune into reality. But also, that we really do have the power to make our existence better we just have to believe in ourselves enough to do it and things will get better.If you're a gamer or even a rookie in it, fan of nostalgia, a person from the 80 or any decade, or even just a fan of sci-fi, like any good game it's worth a try.Ready Player One scores.Rating: 4 stars",10,0,2,1 May 2018
Alien," Deep Dark Space
","Were always afraid of the dark because it always consists of the unknown, there probably in reality isn't anything really there but we can never be completely sure because we simply are unable to see what is or isn't there. Alien is one of the first sci-fi horror films I've seen and is still one of my all time favorite sci-fi horror films.One of the things that was interesting about this film was the complex setting over a not so complex cat and mouse game format. We see a deep dark honest look at the yang side of the 'Star Trek' future. We see a space ship that is impressive looking to the audience but we can tell from how beat up it looks on the outside, even the title of the spaceships words are faded; so it's obviously seen better days. Even the inside of the ship isn't any better looking, from bad lighting, constant mechanical problems like in one scene landing gear breaks like a toothpick when they land on a planet; some computers are out of order and might be dated looking. It sort of reflects the characters state of mind. But that lighting also almost give the film sort of a Gothic sensibility.The other thing that works are the characters they all look and act like everyday people. None of them are really handsome or beautiful looking (well except of Sigonrey Weaver as Ripley). Let alone all of them are adults and I like that as opposed to the pretty boy girl look which I can't stand or everyone being teens which is getting really old. I really like how all of them play it straight and seem to be blue collar types; we see from their conversations despite being in space all of them are bored or had enough and simply just want to go home and get paid. And when their given the task to explore a newly discovered planet according to their company regulations to explore the planet, most of them have bored and tired expressions on their faces let alone groan as if another school assignment is being handed to them. Wonder if there was ever a moment in 'Star Trek' where one day Kirk and crew had to explore another planet, Spock would say fascinating, but might really be thinking boring. But their all well rounded you actually care about them and hope that at least one of them will make it.This helps give us the sense of reality of this world of tomorrow and what it has come to. A future where bureaucracy and greed are in control and are playing with people's lives to suit their own selfish and meaningless gains, advanced technology decaying from age, and possibilities becoming limited.Still this world of tomorrow is fascinating and when the characters arrive on the alien planet it doesn't disappoint. The production value is just magnificent because it's all practical hand built, as we see some organic gigantic space craft. And the mystique it contains where we see some giant looking at some telescope and there are eggs beneath, what could those eggs be there for, an experiment gone wrong, their own discovery turned against them who knows.The Alien crate as well as the space craft an everything in it was inspired and designed by my favorite artist H.G. Gigger who always had a style of making surrealistic, dark, organic, sometimes mechanical creatures and structures all making a bizarre, exotic, grotesque, beautiful blend. Just like the design and behavior of the creature which seems to be a bizarre blend of a lot of things with the animalistic destructive qualities which make it all the more terrifying. We only get flashes and glimpses of the monster to make the presence of evil hidden and a powerful force to be reckoned with. The fact the ship has poor lighting, claustrophobic and isolated setting doesn't help much which gives the alien more advantage. Even in moments when were in the safe zone away from the creature we don't feel safe because we know it could be anywhere and hit us anytime. When it hits the results are nasty, that chest burster scene the first time I saw it made me sick luck I didn't eat anything.The cat and mouse game is all about tension where literally feel like your the cat in some places, the mouse in others. The music score from the late great Jerry Goldsmith, is just superb it is one of my favorite suspenseful scores. This helps in the suspenseful build up till at the very last moment when you least expect it, the cat comes in for the kill. My favorite scene which scared the hell out of me was the air duct hunt scene. That part literally made me claustrophobic and afraid of the dark, the use of the sound of that radar really put me on red alert the whole time. And it's suspense just built up till I actually jumped or moved back in my seat, it's that scary.Space is a deep dark place full of possibilities and danger where no one can help you.Rating: 4 stars",10,0,1,19 August 2012
Tangled," Hair Rasing Adventure
","It has been far too long since we seen another animated fantasy film that Disney is best known for. As a person that has watched these kinds of films since childhood my patience was seriously getting tested. This is one of my favorite animated films because it really helped bring back the old Disney films I knew and loved.The animation is just superb, you can tell the animators were just at their A game, and the effort shows. From the background really capturing a sort of post medieval pre Renaissance era, as well as just the look of the forests and everything in it. However what impresses me the most is the character animation.The songs are hit or miss, that's what you get for most musicals. The one song that stands out for me and I feel is the most memorable is 'At last I see the Light' which is just beautiful, it is a song of course about the romance between both Flynn and Rapunzel but also about discovering your dreams.However it's the story and characters I really love the best. Supporting character Maxamus is great, he's sort of like Duddley Do Right's horse. Like in that cartoon the horse seems to be doing a better job at exercising authority than Duddley. And I really like the buddy dynamic between both Flynn and Maxamus, there is always something really fun and touching about seeing two characters on different sides of the fence working together and bonding, we see both of them giving each other grief but also getting along and both do come though and work together.Rapunzel is great (voiced by underrated actress Mandy Moore)she's beautiful inside and out, sweet, funny, has just great charisma, energetic, and ambitious. I just love how much of a free spirit she truly is, despite being locked up in a tower most of her life her spirit will always be free. And she is a bit reluctant at times which is normal, but I like that she does go on and becomes more confidant in her actions which is something I can emphasize with. And also she's she is able to hold her own against danger.It's interesting just seeing her use non cleche items, from a frying pan which surprisingly becomes useful as a weapon though out the whole film, hey there's no weapon store/pawn shop nearby to buy a sword so it makes sense. But I really love how she uses her hair which is just amazing, you would think anyone with overlong hair would have trouble walking. But here Rapunzel we see her use to it and it's interesting seeing how well she managed maneuvering without any trouble. Her hair is indeed very useful, from acting as a lasso but most importantly she has a magical ability which is her hair is able to glow not just to light the way in the dark, but to heal fatal wounds.I even like how she seems to have this blissful affect on most people, like in that scene with the Vikings in the bar, it was kinda funny how her charm got them to reveal themselves for not being just stereotypical brute but people with dreams and needs like ourselves. But she's a character also a character that you do feel sympathy for, from the back story which is pretty sad, she's practically been a slave/prisoner most of her life unknowingly; so years of Rapunzel's life have been stolen from her let alone time with her real parents. It's just not right, that all the more gives us reason why we want Rapunzel to win, she's was meant to live free and meant to have real love in her life.But of course my favorite character is Flynn Rider (played well by Zachary Levi) he sort of reminds me The Prince of Theves character from the TV show 'Hercules the Legendary Journeys' like that character he's a real con man whom is pretty much looking out for number one and trying to get rich quick. Is a bit shallow since he has a bit of narcissism but in a harmless sense. This is the kind of guy whom would probably be one of the last choices to save the princess but he had the luck of the draw, and hey not all heroes are perfects but sometimes to me their the best kind. He's got great charisma which is fun, clever and funny, just has some of the best lines in the film.I also like you even feel a slight sense of sympathy for him, because Flynn isn't entirely all cheerful he's been alone most of his life so he's kinda lonely; but worst of all he has no real dreams because he doesn't really know what he wants in his life let alone what he was looking for; despite how many things he stole he still has nothing. But that's because he's been looking for the wrong thing.I love the chemistry between both Rapunzel and Flynn, it's funny how both of them give each other grief. But then both of them after a long while open up to one another and warm up to each other. I like how both of them bring out something inside each other they never felt before, for Rapunzel it's a sense of adventure and freedom but for Flynn it's unselfishness and warmth. Both are right for each other you know Rapunzel's place isn't in the tower but with Flynn and Flynn has finally found what he was looking for.If the film has a message it's about not being afraid to make you dreams come true, do everything in your power or what is necessary to make it possible. But most importantly to never stop dreaming and pursuing them.Just like Rapunzel hair this film glows.Rating: 4 stars",10,8,11,20 May 2014
Watchmen," Soul of a Superhero
","Being a Superhero can be fun but the undeniable truth they all know is that their all human behind the mask. Sure I wouldn't mind being a Superhero but I can't do it 24.7 and it's not something I would want to do everyday or even forever for that matter if it interferes with my personal life too much. 'Watchmen' is my second favorite graphic novel and I'm proud to say it's one of my favorite comic book movie adaptations and one of my personal favorite movies.Watchmen was never really a superhero epic but more of a character drama which was what made it great, and it was always the humanity of a superhero that I was always interested in the most. We get to know who each of the individuals behind the masks are they all have wants, needs, flaws, fears, feelings and can age which makes them human. The Wam Bam aspect came secondary which was fine by me since sometimes but it's nature it was story filler that can bring the character drama and development to a grinding halt which annoys me in some comics. There is a who dunnit plot that intriguingly develops but the story was never entirely concerned about it.Everything in this film is great and done right, from the setting they are able to successfully create the alternate America from the book which spans from 1960, 70, and 80. From the technologies which are in between modern and futuristic, what they watched, music, but also the costumes the superheroes wear. The fight sequences are great, the choreography is well done and their pretty violent; along with the special effects. It's true the film is long but the length was just right and I really didn't notice since this is one of those films your highly engrossed in that you don't care.There are a lot of great characters that are all three dimensional and told in a non linear and multi focus format (similar to the TV show 'Lost' and movie 'Pulp Fiction').Walter Kovacs/Rorshach (Jackie Earle Haley)he's my favorite character in the book and the actor not just looked like him but nailed the persona perfectly. He's sort of a more accessible Batman like character, highly intelligent, enigmatic, spooky, and might have a bit of a screw loose due to his strict black and white ethical belief that everything is arbitrary and has a pattern which probably only exists in his mind. That mask of his is one of the most impressive one's I've seen (how the heck he can see and breath in it is anyone's guess) because it's an ink blot test pattern that constantly changes. Trust me, he may'be a small guy and doesn't look like much but if any bad guy tries to pick on him he'll make them into dog meat. For example, while in prison one big guy goes at him with a knife, Rorshach just hits him with a food tray and throws deep fry grease onto him, ouch.Jon Osterman/Dr. Manhattan (Billy Crudup) he is the most complicated of them all because he's the only one that really has superpowers. It almost seems he has the good deal but sometimes with some superheroes all great power has a price. From him it was simply his human identity and mortality. His abilities have literally given him a sort of godhood, he can see multiple possibilities before they happen and has immortality. These things have made him detached from human kind to the point where his former human identity has became a distant untouchable memory. In a way his longing for mortality again is similar to Greek Myth how Gods would watch over mortals but then become mortal themselves once in a while just to get a taste what they don't/can't have or be.Dan/Night Owl 2 (Patrick Wilson) is another Batman like hero from his inventiveness and all the gadgets in his underground lair. He's laid back and can live a normal life. But deep down once in a while we see he yearns to play his superhero role again because he feels his work is far from done. It sort of reflects the repressed feelings he has carried for Laurie Jupiter/Silk Spectre 2 (Malin Akerman) for a long time.Silk Spectre 2 is a sweet, strong, slightly feisty female superhero but is a little troubled herself in figuring out who she really is and what she wants of both her identity and life.Edward Blake/Comedian (Jeffery Dean Morgan) is an anti hero that you can like or dislike (I'm more leaning toward dislike) at the same time, he is a person that has done some shady things in both personal and professional life, but we see he's a broken person from his eyes there's a sense of shame and regret.Adrian Veidt/Ozymadias (Matthew Goode) is the smartest man in the world, idealistic and has literally unbeatable martial arts skills but he's a shady enigmatic characters; he's a bit cold and might have developed a bit of a god complex which makes him a bit chilling.The film shows a superhero is always human, it doesn't matter what unique abilities he/she has there will always be limitations. Sure 'Spiderman' can shoot webs and swing from point A to B, but he can't fly nor get to somebody in trouble 100 miles away. And he has to go back home and take off his mask to deal with his personal life. Even Superman after a hard day wants to go back to see Lois Lane. There is a conflicting dichotomy as we see humans wanting to be superheroes and stay super for their human lives are limiting and equally despise the role because it keeps them from being human and live life as themselves.Superheroes behind the masks are made of flesh, blood and possess human souls.Rating: 4 stars",10,3,6,12 November 2012
The Thing," Enemy Within
","Trust has became a scarce commodity, because of the simple fact we never really know a person, because in reality it's impossible to know a person fully, there is just always something to hide.This film is my favorite film from my favorite movie director John Carpenter as well as my favorite horror film and favorite films in general. The film really helped pave the way for the way we look at most horror and suspense films but also was an inspiration for video games like 'Dead Space', parts of 'Resident Evil'. It's also a prime example of a remake when done the right way, don't get me wrong I like the 1950's film it's good in it's own way but I love the 80's version more because of just that being good in it's own way, a way I just like the most.There is so much I really love about this film, I love the creature effects from one of my favorite make up/effect artists Rob Boltin as well as the late great Stan Winston. I liked seeing the dolperganger alien whenever it pops out it just seems to always transform into whatever the heck it's suppose to look like, it just seems to be a mixture of things, their slightly inspired by the monster from H.P. Lovecraft's stories which always had bizarre otherworldly monsters.I love the location it really sets up a atmosphere of fear and isolation. The music from Enccio Morone is excellent, it's one of my favorite horror scores ever, the theme song is memorable it just has that evokes the feeling of cold lonely fear. But most importantly it was in the suspense which is the best thing and a common thing with Carpenter.You are just on red alert throughout the whole film, because the danger doesn't let up even in it's peaceful moments. I actually jumped a few times watching this movie and that was a great feeling that I don't get often. Like that infamous blood test scene, I was at edge having both anticipation on who the Thing is but at the same time scared of the possibility of the Thing. You really feel just that sense of paranoia. From the enviorment which feels palpable, just the cold, darkness, and sheer isolation knowledge that these people are in the middle of nowhere and there is no one out there to help because their miles away. There is also the fact that no one can really run or even hide, because you really can't get out of the facility there is nothing out in that envorment to run to, you'll freeze to death in mere minutes. And due to the Thing being anyone along with how small the facility is it leaves few places to really hide. So it leaves you with that sense of doom and dread because of the lack of those options.It's true these characters don't have much depth and you don't get to really know most of them despite some personality on them but that's the point. Even though these characters all live under the same roof you can see their all not really close, and it just goes to show that just because your in the same enviorment doesn't automatically mean all will be friends, it's like with the high school and collage I've been to there are hundreds or almost thousands of people that I pass by or go to class with and barely know a mere fraction of them.Though a couple of characters stand out for me mainly MacReady and Childs played by two favorite actors of mine Kurt Rusell and Keith David. Both just have some of the best lines and both are proactive in the situation, I like how both are scared but their don't wimp out against danger they fight back, let alone that really is the only option available. Let alone both are likable and easy to emphasize with a bit because both are bored and just want to get the heck out of the facility. I don't blame them, I might just go nuts being there to long without a anime convention or girl around that can really suck.The Thing itself it an enigma, we don't really know it's motives or if it even has any. Nor does it seem to have really a true form since it can replicate itself by being viral. I even like how it behaves which makes it feel all the more real, despite primal it's capable of intelligence it was able to fly and tried to rebuild it's spacecraft after all. It's also kinda like a game hunter, the Thing doesn't really do anything at first but you know it will once it's moment comes, the humans it imitates are practically it's camouflage which is it's edge, and what makes it a hard opponent to nail. Did the Thing come from another planet we haven't discovered or may'be another galaxy. Was the alien suppose to be some kinda scout for invasion of Earth or could it of been some sort of bio weapon some alien race created to help destroy Earth's inhabitants. I don't know your theories are as good as mine, but that makes the creature all the more scary.This film was an acknowledgment of cold war paranoia as well as paranoia of disease in the 80's decade but I also feel it's relevant today with our decade with our war on terrorism and chemical weapons/disease epidemics. The main theme is about distrust of our fellow man, how it is not the enemy seen that will destroy people but it is fear of the stranger that becomes our undoing.It's not the enemy that you see that should be fear, it is the enemy unseen.Rating: 4 stars",10,1,2,24 January 2012
Silver Linings Playbook," Game Plan
","As a saying goes when the door is shut, god opens a window. Yeah we all had out down points in life, however the truth about life is it's most of the time a matter of how you get back up from troubled circumstances is what counts. This is one of those romance stories I really like because like any plan in football that works it runs toward the goal line.With any good romance stories and dramas this film has characters that I actually care about and really like. But also really love the quarky, bizarre yet down to earth nature of the film.The dialog in this film is great, it is at times a little strange and humorous but I feel that's what makes the characters seem more human. It really felt like I was hearing people talking and not just fictional characters.Pat is played well by Bradley Cooper this is probably my favorite role from him for now. Pat is a broken guy you really feel pathos for. The legal and psychological troubles he's been though, sure what it did isn't completely right, but the guy he beat up wasn't innocent; along with a painful divorce. I like how his aggressive attitude toward things which is not just a psychological problem but a quark. One really funny scene is when he does a rant on a Ernest Heminway book which he literally throws out the window, it's funny because he kinda makes a point. He wants to rejoin life again but the problem is he's calling the wrong play.I really like how the film at times has some really intense scenes. Like one where Pat was acting out a bit from the fact he couldn't find the wedding video, you can't help but feel for the guy as he has both anger and sadness combined, the fact that the wedding video is gone reflects the life he can't get back because to him that was the only times of happiness. But I really like the humanity of his character, whenever he feels he letting people down whether it's his mom, dad, or Tiffany he feels awful about it and himself; I feel it shows he's not a selfish person he really does care about other people and letting them down is the last thing he wants.However my favorite character in the film is Tiffany, played brilliantly by Jennifer Laurence whom I think is kinda hot and a more than capable actress. Her character reminds me a little of April Ludgate from 'Parks and Recreation' whom is also a little similar. I really love how fiery, feisty, energetic, a little bizarre, dark, she has charisma which is black, quarky, or clever. However the best thing about her to me is the fact that she accepts that she's not perfect she has her psychological troubles but she accepts them. She also a character you feel pathos for since like with Pat had to endure a loss, with her though it was the loss of her husband. I like that she's is ambitious in a way, she loves dancing and wants to be a champion but also doesn't want to be alone wants someone in her life again.You already know in the film both really are a good match for one another. Both are somewhat the same, like with Pat she's also has aggression in an intense scene in the restaurant just seeing her exercise it makes me feel she might be more aggressive than Pat. Both are broken and are trying to get their lives back together as well have more in their life that they haven't had. And the chemistry between them is great I really love the banter between them, there are sparks whether they know it or not, and they support one another in a way; heck both of them dance well together so that ought to say something.And you want both of them together but not just yet because like with any good romance story I feel one or both have to earn it first. And both do, in a way the film is a bit like a Howard Hawks film, as the film goes on both characters grow, Pat becomes more of a man and Tiffany more of a woman. And as that happens both start connecting, say things they probably never said to anyone else.However this I don't think is just a romance about two people but it's also about love for family.The supporting characters are also really good each with quarks and trouble of their own. Robert De Nero as Pat Sr I thought was great, just like his son he's psychologically troubled. And just like his son has a humanity, really like this one touching moment when he has a talk down with Pat and admits he hasn't been the best father. And we see in the film both of them also start growing closer becoming in touch with one another again.I've said enough, Silver Linings Playbook is a touchdown.Rating: 4 stars",10,5,8,27 February 2013
The Lego Movie," Lego Maniac
","Legos were always one of my favorite toys as a kid, the beauty of them is the amount of creative freedom you have, you can just build anything you imagine.This film was a dream come true for me, it was one of those films that you wouldn't think would happen but it did and I'm glad for that. Like a well built Lego configuration everything works well.The animation is fantastic, everything is CGI but they all look real, just the amount of detail and color. I love how the Lego world/universe is created each of them are unique and different, which makes sense since there are dozens of sets. My favorite one is the one in the clouds which is the fun but weird utopia, just seeing these things showed a fantasy world/universe with endless possibilities where anything can happen. I also love how there is always a lot happening in the background, it's sort of like with the illustration art in the 'Where's Waldo' books; it would probably take more than one watch just to see it all.But to me what I really love is the movements which looks like stop motion, and it fits well let alone adds to the humor and fun. It makes sense they would move stop motion like because Lego Figurines have a limited amount of movement except for the vehicles.The music is great, some of the songs are memorable, the one that really sticks out is the song 'Everything is Awesome' indeed it is.I like the story it's a simplistic fantasy plot on good guys and bad in a race to clam a certain object which could destroy the world and a chosen one can turn the tide. Yeah it's that simple but that what I love about it, it doesn't make itself too complicated for it's own good, but just sticks to being what it should be fun.The voice cast is just excellent, each of them really fit like a glove for their roles. From the villain Lord Business played well by Will Ferrell, he's a fun villain that I don't feel is really evil but his head is in the wrong place. His goal is simply to create a perfect world, but he can't see clearly the corrupt nature of his actions and that perfection is possible but unknowable.Supporting Characters are great, Wyldstyle played by Elizabeth Banks is great she's the typical fem fatale heroine whom is true to his name. A woman of action, super creative from how fast she can built vehicles, but also deep down she is a softy but is a bit insecure in showing it.Liam Neeson is just great as Good Cop/Bad Cop whom is kinda a 'Dr.Jecell and Mr.Hide' like character. His voice acting was great I really bought both sides were two different people but also that he's actually funny. However two of my favorite characters are Batman played well by Will Arnett. I'm so psyched that they made this DC superhero a characters since he's my favorite comic book hero. Anyway I really love how they make him the usual super cool can as usual kick some ass but also is dryly comical from some of what he says and his exaggerated mannerisms, he's as funny as the Adam West Batman.But my favorite character is Emmitt played with hilarity and charm by Chris Pratt; which is cool since I'm a 'Parks and Recreation' fan and Andy is my second favorite character. He kinda plays that same character Andy but on a more lighter and less cruder note. It's just funny how bright he really is despite his life not being so great he doesn't let it get him down. This also makes him a sypmpathic character because he doesn't really have friends, but that's because no one really knows him which is something I can emphasize with and all the more makes you want to bet on him. It's also funny how he's at first not the brightest bulb, and we literally see his brain has nothing in it. But he's capable of having ideas which seems like a stupid idea at first but it surprising comes into use, it shows he might be onto something. And also has a big heart, he not afraid to do what's right but also like the chemistry he has with Wyld Style both have a great back and forth which made be care about both characters more.The humor is just fantastic it would take more than one watch to get it all; from the visual humor to the dialog which is just fraking hilarious it is just crackling with hilarity. There are just lots of memorable lines from not just main and supporting characters but even characters that make cameos. And there are tons of visual reference jokes and the cameo voices with them. From other DC Characters like Superman (Channing Tatum), Green Lanturn (Joanah Hill), and Wonder Woman (Cobbie Smothers). But one reference that I thought was comic gold was the 'Star Wars' reference, I'll let you see that one for yourself.Even the action is great, there are some battle sequences that are well choreographed and a lot of fun. I really love the moments when they all just build vehicles or turn things into vehicles almost as fast as the Autobots and Deceptacons transform into vehicles and robots. My favorite building transformation is Emmett whom creates which I think is an awesome mecha that is a homage to the power loader in 'Aliens'.But the film has heart because it has some good messages on the importance and beauty of creativity, not conforming, the proper use of order, being yourself, but also simply believing in yourself.It's always the simplest idea that can create the greatest things.Rating:4 stars",Null,0,1,27 February 2014
Aliens," Final Fronteer Warfare
","As much as I loved the first film I love this film even more. Believe it or not this film is actually my second favorite film of all time, I've seen this when I was about 11 and I still love it even today. This wasn't just a film it was a phenomenon as well as one unforgettable experience. It really set the bar form most sci-fi visual mediums we have now like TV shows (Battlestar Galatica revival, EXO Squad, and the criminally underrated Space, Above, and Beyond)as well as became a big influence on video games (Contra, Gears of War, Halo, Dead Space). This film gave us a new way of looking at sci-fi, it was final frontier sci-fi at it's best where it looked futuristic, realistic, believable and accessible.The world is great, this idea of a military of the future let alone in space, the technology that accompanies it. Spaceships, the weapons which look like advanced models of the ones we have now, portable flame units and my the pulse rifles, the sound of the rifles is awesome. The concept of artificial terror forming which gives us the power to make any planet we want habitable. However my favorite technology is the Power Loader, it was the first time I've ever seen a mecha ever, it's basically a simple construction vehicle nothing special in that world but in my eyes just the way it moved and worked I waned to drive one of those things.Music by James Horner one of my favorite composers is great, the score is just fantastic it's just has that exciting and epic feel to it.The effects and production value are superb because it's all practical most from my favorite effects guy the late great Stan Winston. Nothing was half baked the amount of detail in construction they really put a hell of a lot of effort and it shows. I love the dark atmosphere, just the use of limited light and darkness almost gives the film a slight Gothic foreboding sensibility to it as if there could be danger hiding behind one corner or another, you wouldn't know it will hit you until it's too late. The fact that there is more than one Zenomorph in this film and one new one which is the Queen Alien, it is the most gigantic intimidating monster I've ever seen it scared me when I was a kid and still makes me nervous ever time I see it.All that makes the danger all the more increased and puts you on red alert the whole way through. Usually with one monster you have many opportunities to evade but when it comes to an army of them your chances are slim. The way there handled, their behavior they were primal but not stupid. The fight with them was made similar to the Vietnam war and the Zenomorphs were sort of made to be like the Viet Cong who utilized gorilla tactics to bring down their opponents and undermine the high technology they have. The film of course also has that little underline message on humanity versus corruption and dehumanization. Demonstrated from the parallel between the evil destructive Zenomorphs and the unfeeling, cold blooded, destructive Weyland company that is willing to commit murder and breach ethical boundaries in both science and humanity all to make a fast profit.There are a lot of memorable things that were scary like the use of the portable radar and the sound it makes really put me on the edge of my seat, however one part of the film made me jump when Hicks looks up at the ceiling and sees a whole horde of Zenomorphs. As a kid that actually scarred me because I remembered my house had an attic I was afraid those things might be crawling up there. Down to the action sequences which are great their well choreographed, from seeing Ripley going all out in an alien hive but my favorite and it's no surprise is the fight with Ripley in the power loader against the Queen which is one of my favorite fights ever.The character are colorful, interesting as well as memorable. Vasquez (Jenette Goldstein) a really tough as nails woman with the attitude to go with it, she's awesome my third favorite character and one of the most memorable female fatales in movies ever in my book. Dwane Hicks (Michael Bien) is my second favorite because he's the most level headed leader sort of a calm authoritative figure but also just a bad ass, from what he says to his actions. But of course my favorite no surprise is Ellen Ripley (Sigorney Wever) her character helped set the bar for the female fatales to come (Buffy, Betrix Kiddo, Lara Croft, you name it) and she's still number one in my book. From her leadership ability toward the Space Marines which is great she should of been a Space Marine Commander, or even a Commando seeing her going against the Zenomorphs and kicking ass just shows she's a bad ass as well. However it's the emotion she carries which makes her feel all so human. You can't help but feel for her from what she sees and feels from her facial and emotional expressions you see she is a person that is driven by internal rage, from her feelings toward the heartless Weyland company she worked for, her post traumatic experiences, the fact she has nothing really to come back to since her daughter is now deceased. The only thing she really has left is her unstoppable determinations toe save and protect everything that is good from evil of any form because she still believes in the value of humanity, that it's always worth fighting for.Aliens is an experience that take you to space, above, and beyond.Rating: 4 stars",10,2,5,2 November 2012
Scott Pilgrim vs. the World," Video Game Warrior
","One of the rarest things to ever happen to me, is finding a movie that has about everything I want, or even as a fan of a comic book for an adaptation to live up to my expectations. This film does that just like the graphic comic mini series it was derived from it is a film I feel was made for me.This film just has so much that one watch just isn't enough. The action is great it is well filmed just old fashioned style (which I prefer) where you can see the hits as well as who's hitting who. It is well choreographed, it really looks like a video game or even comic book/anime come to life. From the visual effects and sound when we see the attacks delivered down to the power moves. Just seeing this makes me wonder why the hell the live action 'Street Fighter' movies couldn't of pulled this off. This also creates sort of a fantasy world, kinda like with the show's 'The Adventures of Pete and Pete' and the underrated 'Community' or even the video games 'Earthbound' and the 'Persona' series. It's a world that is one foot in reality but also just one foot away, everyone acts as though what is going on is all a part of everyday life. I love those kinds of fantasy worlds because their more accessible and feel as though anything to even a random everyday person is possible. The music is also great most to all of the songs are memorable, two of my favorites are the theme song and Threshold. But what really gives this movie power is in it's dialog and characters.The dialog and humor is just hilarious, this film is one of those rare movies where sometimes by re watching you can uncover something new, sometimes I find a joke that might of went over my head, that just makes the film all the more funnier. There is also a great amount of reference jokes much like in 'Futurerama' and 'South Park', from video games like 'Street Fighter', 'Double Dragon', movies like 'The Warriors', you name it it's there.Characters even the minor ones are all great and I felt cast just right. Even though for the record I'm not a fan of the actor, Michael Cera I thought did very well as the character, I really felt like he was Scott Pilgrum. What I love about Scott is just how relatable he is, Scott is a bit like myself in real life; he's shy, insecure, ill confidant but not short of courage, loves video games, and trying to find himself. I also love the fact that Scott looks like any other everyday person, he's not some stereotypical pretty boy, this helped in the relatablity.Mary Elesebeth Winstead is perfect in the role of Ramona Flowers, I've always imagined that actress's voice when I read the series, so her playing Ramona is a dream come true. She is hotter than hell (in my book anyway)and capable actress to boot. Ramona is feisty, fiery, spontaneous, rebellious, bitchy (I mean that in a good way) despite these things she's capable of warmth and mature, and like Scott is also trying to find herself (heck her changing hair color reflects that).I love the chemistry between the two it's one of those rare examples of a romance when done the right way, because it feels true to what I've been though with my significant other. Like the moment both first met in an awkward conversation, that's happened to me because what do you say to a girl you've just met, it's not like there are guidelines. The conversations they have with one another and the time they spend together, it just feels right you know both are right for one another and you want them together.Like the minor character Knives Chaou played by Ellen Wong whom is also hotter than hell and a capable actress hoping she gets more in the future. Knives is 17 (though in reality the actress is 25) she's young, full of energy, sweet, has some fire in her which we see in the final fight, a bit immature though I don't mind. The way the film handled her I could of gone either way (though on a side note I like Ramona even more but that's just me) but we know who the right one is so it makes sense who Scott chooses in the end.The villains are all colorful, just like in a 'Street Fighter' video game each have different abilities to do serious damage. However all of them are unlikeable, their just all dirt bags with a capital D, their the kind of people that have pushed me around in my middle school, man did I hate them; all the more reason we want Scott to win.The film has multiple themes, in a way the film is a bit like a Howard Hawks film as the situation progresses Scott becomes more of a man and Ramona becomes more of a woman. For Scott it's doing things for yourself as well being more than what you are if you want things to get better, Scott's life has always been on hold because he wasn't doing what he should be doing, but once he stepped up to plate that's when life got better. Ramona it's finding what she needed as opposed to what she thinks she wants. All of her evil exes had one thing in common they didn't give her what she really needed, Scott was able to give her what she needed which is kindness, warmth, and understanding. All the more reason why he's right for her.Well that's all I have to say, Scott Pilgrim is an epic, well sort of.Rating: 4 stars",10,2,5,4 January 2012
Die Hard 2," Heavy Turbulance and High Thrills
","This is my third favorite film in the franchise and another one of my favorite action films and favorite Christmas films. It's true this sequel isn't as good as the first in my book but it's not trying to be, it's being it's own thing but also just bee a good action film which is all I really ask for sequels to action films to be.I really like the plot line which I feel is once again plausible and a little scary as this plot hits a little too close to home considering what's happened in recent years. I really love the fact that despite utilizing the same format of the lone hero against a terrorist force and taking place in Christmas time, but the arena is different as this time it's an airport and the leverage is different as the hostages are in air liners, so yeah the stakes are higher and as an old saying goes, it's a whole new ball game.Characters are pretty good. William Sadler an underrated actor I like, he's a solid main villain He's not really on the same level as Hans and Simon Gruber in my book, he's sort of a B list villain in my book but I don't mind and their better than one's on the D list. He's a villain that is pretty unlikable, this is a guy that is completely cold, calculating, and one that's not afraid to cross the line. I like we see little bits in his character from the possibility he could be a sociopath as he doesn't seem to care about who he kills or anyone else except for anyone that is involved in his operation and is only concerned about his gains or whatever he clams drives him.But the interesting thing is how hypocritical he is as we hear, though in not much detail they guy was a war hero but somewhere along the line he turned coat. And two things he says about a drug lord having the guts to stand against commie aggression and a quote from a general about 'treason being a matter of dates' (whatever the hell that's supposed to mean), from those things he says it shows how far bent and broken his moral compass truly is.Franco Nero, he has a small cameo role as the Drug Lord, it's sort of interesting that he's in this movie as Franco was a famous action star in the 70's mainly for those Italian exploitation action film's which are cool. Just seeing him and Bruce Wills there in the same film is cool as you have an action star from yesteryear and today. It's a shame both of them didn't get to do some sort of action film together where they were both allies.Bruce Willis as usual is great as John whom is once again the reluctant hero that didn't ask to be a hero but is. Really like how John Amo's character in one scene sums up McClane 'You're the wrong man, at the wrong place, at the wrong time.' And John says, 'Story of my life.' Yes, it is actually it sums up the whole Die-Hard franchise.Its true John might not be the right hero for the job but he's the hero we need as usual he is kick terrorist scum ass, despite the fact he really wishes he didn't have too, what sane person really does. He as usual has some of the best memorable lines, really like what he says as he is about to crawl into another air duct, yeah John I know the feeling there are somedays I'd rather be and do something else, let alone just have a simple quiet Christmas myself.The action is great as usual, I really like how the violence is amped up in this film as we actually see some really good blood and squib effects making the film a little more violent than its predecessor. From that Skywalk shootout which was really cool seeing John waste those scum mercs. On a side note one of those mercs was played by Robert Patrick which is cool and true as most familiar faces have got their start playing small roles. Man would have been cool seeing both Bruce and him do a film together.There is the snowmobile chase and tussle at the Church area. Really like some of the kills in the film that are really good from a platform used as a guitine to smash a scum merc's chest and my favorite where John kills another scum merc by killing him 'Buffy the Vampire Slayer' style ripping out an icicle and staking him.But also, what equal powers the movie and franchise in general is in the suspense and this film does have a really good amount of suspense. From once again getting a step ahead of our protagonist as we see some of what Stewart is up to and hoping John will be able to pick up on it and get a step ahead of them if possible. But also there are some things about Stewart's plan we don't have all the details about which lead to a twist or two that I felt is a good example of ones done right because despite not seeing it one hundred present coming it doesn't feel out of left field and it makes perfect sense.Even like that military funeral scene where John was trapped in a airplane cockpit and multiple grenades were being thrown in, at that moment you know John is in deep crap, I remember being on the edge of my seat in that moment and thinking 'Get out, now, now now!' how John escapes I'll just say 'MacGyver, eat your heart out.'There are also some bits of emotion as well, like there is one scene I won't say what that is but there is a scene that is just tragic which just like John put a real tear or two in my eyes. But that scene alone acknodged the jeopardy factor, why losing isn't an option, but most importantly all the more made you care and want John to win; teach Stewart and his scum army a lesson they'll remember forever.It's true the film does come into a turbulence spot or two, for one thing this is a minor quibble is the fact that there isn't really a memorable supportive cast for John. Yeah there are a few characters that help him like a controller guy, head control guy, and Marvin the Janitor but that's pretty much all and they do help out but not as much. Would of helped the film if John had a number two to bounce off of, like having Denis Franz (another underrated actor I like) instead of being a stereotypical blowhole chief or even Robert Patrick as John's partner helping him out in the situation.But my main problem with the movie is the pacing is rather uneven, really touch and go. It's just there are places where when the action ends nothing happens for a while. Part of the other problem is some of the scenes with John's wife Holy and that so-called Reporter Dick Thornburg I thought were unnecessary as most of it really didn't do much for the story and were filler by their nature. It just seemed like in those spaces of nothing John should be on the move doing something. But these are just minor specs of turbulence easy to fly though, other than that everything else is fine.Die Hard 2 flies high with thrills.Rating: 3 and a half stars",9,0,0,3 January 2020
Avengers: Endgame," Avengers Final Fight
","Warning do not read unless seen film.It's was a long time coming but it was well worth the wait (for me anyway) and the film is somewhat an end of an era for the MCU. The film is fitting in many ways as this helps celebrate another grand anniversary for Marvel, the late great Stan Lee whom makes one final cameo here, but also the departure of most of the MCU alumni as it's their last film.This film is different, from the fact it's one of the longest comic book film yet almost the length of 'The Ten Commandments', ok not really but clocked at three hours it's close. But the pacing was good I hardly noticed the time at all. But also just it's overall format as it's sort of like with the film 'A Better Tomorrow 2' (I said sort of) It's all a big build up to lead you to a phenomenal payoff; and that's not a bad thing as it kept me enthralled and invested in the characters and what their doing. This film is dark as usual but has a mix of emotion which makes the film bittersweet at time, where there are some exciting and cheerful parts but then there are some tragic moments, one moment I won't say what put tears in my eyes along with most of the other audience, where I actually heard some crying behind me.The first half of the film it's sort of a character drama as we see each of the Avengers deal with aftermath blues. Five years have passed and we see just like the post-apocalyptic world their living in everyone is just broken, I'll admit it was pretty damn sad watching this, even the very beginning of the film was tragic, which I'll admit is something different for a comic book adaptation film where it would usually start of with wham bam action, this just isn't that time nor day for the Avengers.There are certain scenes of grimness like Scott Lang/Ant Man whom is visiting a memorial site which has lots of walls and names and he is making sure his daughter isn't on there, same with myself. Or even Natasha/Black Widow whom we see is the new head of S.H.E.L.D. (or should I say broken shield) as she's talking with the others you see her eating what looks like an unappetizing and not completely healthy sandwich. Things like that just show how time doesn't heal all wounds, it leave a scar; it makes sense the Avengers would all be in a bad states of mind because before Thanos they all had lives and people in them which gave them reasons to fight for, strip all that away and they have nothing their practically directionless and roleless. This goes to show how truly human the Avengers are, their all are living in crap county and can't find a way out; this just even more makes us want the Avengers to rise again not just to save the universe but to save their own souls.Each of the characters are good they all have their moments and hand in things, but also some good drama. I just state some of the ensemble.
Thanos (Josh Brolin): as usual is good, really like how he still a force to be reckoned with and isn't going to go easy on them anytime soon. There is one moment in the final battle that was so satisfying when he delivers a power punch to one character, I'm not a fan of, I won't say who, but I don't think I'm alone in saying it actually put a smile on my face.Ant Man/Scott Lang (Paul Rudd): he's his usual fun self but I really like how in some of the beginning and a bit of the rest of the film he's almost the main hero as he's the one that is not just offering a opportunity but also really helping bring the band back together.Thor (Chris Helmsworth): he's fun as usual, it's funny how he sorts of looks and is dressed like The Dude from 'The Big Lebowski' but at the same time sad as it's shown how badly the aftermath blues have hit him. It sorts of your getting back in the saddle story where we see slowly but surely in the adventure, he's starting to become himself again.Clint/Hawkeye/Ronin (Jeremy Reiner): His character is tragic in this film; from the loss he's endeared he's became a shadow of himself. No longer an agent of Shield, he has become a Mercenary which we know in the comics as Ronin, where we see him not just use the bow but the katana which I thought was cool. Really like his back and forth with Natasha/Black Widow she's sort of like the sister he never had, she really helps in not just going on this quest but also toward self-forgiveness to reclaim his soul.Tony/Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr) is also great, it's interesting seeing him settled down with his wife Pepper and have a daughter Morgan, which makes sense if you remember the Matt Fraction run. Despite slightly settled in his ways he doesn't feel he's finished, and he wants to give his family a better place to live in.The Third and final half is just a phenomenal payoff as it turns into a war movie where we see pretty much 20-30 minute all out war. I won't say most of what happens you must see it all for yourself. But I really like before the battle begins we see as Thanos is giving a bit of a speech, just the look on some of the Avengers emerging from the rubble and the look Steve, Thor, and Tony all have is just great as each of them are just beyond pissed like Jason Vorhees pissed, you just know Thanos is a dead man now. It was great seeing all three just giving all they had on Thanos, Cap with his regular Shield once more don't get me wrong liked the double shields he had but it just isn't quite the same, the circular vibranium shield is still my favorite. Iron Man as usual unleashing his arsenal. But best of all-seeing Thor kicking ass once more but we actually see him duel weld by using not just the Storm Breaker but the Valkyr which I though was a welcome return, as much as I like the axe hammer, I still prefer the first.However the biggest pay off is really what happens in the duration of the time when lets just say we all get the best Christmas present of all which of course lead to the biggest applause and cheering of all in fact two of them; it was such an exciting moment I don't see often. It was just the biggest love letter that spelled Marvel; but most importantly the film reminds us and makes us grateful of the importance of having heroes/superheroes around.Now I'm going to get real guys, for some of the Marvel movie alumni thanks and hopefully we'll see much more in the future. But as for the cast of the Avengers and the characters themselves, thanks for what you've done over the years, without you there wouldn't be an MCU or even a Marvel which is why it's sad to see you go, but you fought your final fight and now it's time to rest. And for Stan Lee I'll miss you, you were the Where's Waldo for the MCU film, but more than that a big influence and inspiration in my life, rest in peace man.Avengers Assemble.Rating: 4 stars",10,133,251,17 May 2019
Wreck-It Ralph," Game Master
","I've been a gamer ever since I was six years old and I still am to this day, I've been there from the video arcades to the console gaming we have now so yeah that's how far my video gaming experience and love for the genre has gone. This film is a dream come true, it's one of those movies I feel were just made for me, I'm glad that finally someone had the guts utilize this idea because like any great video game it actually works.There is just so much I love about this movie it's both a fun and touching underdog story but also a love letter to video games. The animation is just top notch, I just love the character designs from the video game characters were familiar and had cameos like Q-Bert, Pac-Man, Ryu, Ken, you name it. Down to the character focused on my favorite design is Vanellope because she so darn cute. But what impresses me more are the background designs, like the arcade itself and the arcade cabinets animated, for the record most of the video games cabinets seen are actual video games. And the video game worlds were great my favorite one was the Suger Rush world, the game was a mix of both 'Mario Kart' and 'Charlie and the Chocolate Factory'. I simply love the concept that the world of video games is real and that each of the video games are businesses where they work. The humor is great both visual and verbal. There are just so many jokes, homage jokes, and in jokes on some of the clichés and elements in video games, it would probably take more than one watch to catch most to all of them, but there there. From big jokes like the fact there is some sort of group therapy session for bad guys, Oreo Cookie guards, to even tiny jokes like how some of the characters in Ralph's world move which is a little stiff it makes sense since most old games were restricted to certain movements as contrasted with the games we have now where we have more freedom of movement. Even though the film and the characters aren't so serious you do care about them. From supporting characters like Felix (Jack McBrayer) whom is a Mario like protagonist that is unsmooth. Calhoun (Jane Lynch) is a 'Gear of War' like heroine that despite being tough as nails is a softy at heart. I just love how much spit fire she has though another thing that's funny about her is her tragic back story. This is funny because it's true, it's a common cliché with a lot of our current video game heroes and heroines because by it's nature it's a motive device to give them a reason to do what they do. I like the back and forth between them both are sort of a conflicting and correlating dynamic where Felix is the representation of old school gaming and Calhoun new school. Even like the romance between them which is strange (well not that strange if you think of Mario and Princess Peach) but sweet.Ralph (John C Really) is great, he's a gentle blue collar giant who really isn't a bad guy that's just simply his job, but is really a good guy. He's sympathetic because he's an underdog that really gets no respect or even credit for doing his job. This guy has a dream of just having more in his life or at least for life to get better. My favorite line from Ralph is, 'When did video games become so violent and scary?' I always cracked up because it's really not a bad question.But my favorite character though is Vanellope, from the fact she's voiced by one of my favorite comedians Sarah Silverman but I just love her character because she funny as hell. She just has loads of hyper energy makes sense since she lives in a world of candy, has some of the best darn lines, but also just like Ralph her character is an underdog which makes her sympathetic because she's a person with a dream of just wanting to do what she loves racing but is just always getting crap canned because of the fact she glitches, but trust me that glitch is a gift in disguise. I like the back and forth dynamic with Ralph and her, it's pretty much like a buddy buddy comedy.If the film has a message it's about being more than what you are and to not let labels define you.Wreck it Ralph scores.Rating: 4 stars",10,7,9,3 November 2012
Avengers: Infinity War," War for the Universe
","The thing about conflict is it goes both ways, no matter how well trained we are to not lose, no matter how many battles triumphed, death and loss are never far away.This is one of my favorite sequels of all time up there with 'The Empire Strikes Back' in my book, it's also believe it or not my favorite Avengers film (at least for now, till the next one comes out). This film really is something not just is it a big event but it's also the darkest entry in the franchise and MCU, as it is the most epic but also the most tragic. Though the film is fitting as it's takes place in the MSU's 10th Anniversary and through the years it has build itself of to this, and I'll just say it's one hell of a pay off.Characters are good each have good moments: Thor and Peter Quill/Star lord stand out for me I really felt both were at their best on an emotional basis, from what both have to endure it's interesting seeing both of them really pissed, it really drives both of them to do what must be done and you really route for them doing it.Though who also stand out are Scarlet Witch and The Vision, both characters I honestly felt we're really at their best. I really like that you get a little depth on their relationship as we see how far they have can for themselves and each other. It's really touching which is also what makes what they endure all the sadder; I honestly wanted both to somehow find a way to survive but there were no guarantees.However, the one character that stands out in the whole film and that we're all really here for is Thanos. Josh Brolin is just fantastic as Thanos, this is probably my favorite role from him; it just fit like a glove for him (no pun intended). I really love the physicality as well as emotionality of his performance, let alone voice which is spot on I actually did imagine that is what Thanos would sound like. Strangely this film is sort of his movie, he truly is the main character throughout the film. Which is cool, Thanos is one of my favorite fictional villians of all time not just is he terrifying but he's the most complex as he is three dimensional. The most interesting thing about him is he doesn't perceive himself as a villain, he honestly feels what he is doing is right, that it's for the universe's own good as he feels by destroying a certain number of worlds that are heading toward failure, he can save several other worlds in the universe so there would be an harmonious balance. He's actually aware his actions breach ethical boundaries but to him they are necessary evils to accomplish what he sets himself out to do. I even like seeing the emotionality to him as you see from his eyes and voice a lot of anger but also a lot of sadness, as if this guy carries an emotional weight that is as heavy and large as his size as you see this is a person that has endure more than his share of loss. Which fuels his rage as it seems he despises it more than any enemy he fights. I also like that there is a bit of this unpredictability about him, you're not always sure what he's about to do until he does it which can kind of catch you off guard.And of course, his trademark weapon The Infinity Gauntlet is just awesome, it's one of my favorite fictional weapons as that gauntlet with all the stones in place lets you weld God Like Powers. With all six stones intact, you could do just about anything you want, I won't say what you have to see for yourself to believe. I really like the story format and the pace in it is great as it's really fast, despite how long the film actually is I honestly didn't notice the time which is a good sign. At first, it's sort of an adventure as we see things taking place in both space and earth, and it's practically a race for the stones. There is kind of a double layer suspense where on one hand your hoping the Avengers will find the stones before Thanos, but on another hand your kind of are quietly routing for Thanos to find those stones because let's face it we deep down really want to see what each of them can do. And once we see Thanos utilize those stones it doesn't disappoint, it's kind of a payoff for each and every plight.And then the film turns into you could say a war movie, in the final half it gets into one of my favorite battles of all time let alone one of the longest as it clocks in about 30-40 mins. It is just absolute pandemonium as we see left, right up and down there are actually two different battles taking place. One in space with Thanos and a group of Avengers and another on earth against Thanos's forces and the secondary group of Avengers. It's almost like seeing a live action 'Where Waldo' art illustration as there are just things happening all around the characters and you've got just most of the character from the Marvel Verse involved. In the battles there are some really cool moments from Thor getting his new hammer which I'm glad, I know that in the last film 'Thor Ragnorok' he's fully harnessed his power of lightening but it's just not the same, that hammer is his trademark and is just really cool seeing him kick ass with it. Which he does in this film and you can see from the ferocity of his actions he's really mad now. Or even Bruce Banner in that Hulk Buster, I thought it was really cool for once seeing Bruce doing the ass kicking and not relying on the Hulk all the time, it just shows he's no wimp Bruce truly can hold his own against danger.But I like that you see the battle isn't one sided, it really looks like things can go either way. We see the Avengers kicking ass as usual but also, we see Thanos and his forces at times get the upper hand and turn things around. Times like that really made me worried for the lives of the characters, despite the Avengers abilities they're not bullet or knife proof. You really get that wavering feeling you have where at times you feel a glimmer of hope but then gets crushed, you can say by Thanos fist.The score by one of my favorite composers Alvin Sivelstri is good, though it's really the end theme song that is the most memorable and is probably one of my favorite end themes ever. I won't say what kind of theme it is, but I'll just say just like what happens at the end it will hit you really hard.From here I've said enough, and I'll just say one last thing, a battle may be won but the war is far from over.Rating: 4 stars",10,3,5,6 May 2018
Frozen," Ice Princess with Warm Heart
","I'll admit I do have a place in my heart for the Disney fantasy films, from childhood to adulthood most of them are timeless to me because they had heart. This is another film whose heart is in the right place.I really love the animation, it's CGI animation at it's finest once again and used the right way. From the character animation, background which capture a swiss Bavarian setting, however what impresses me the most is the ice power effects which are just beautiful. It is just awesome to see Elsa use her powers; my favorite sequence from that is seeing the construction of the Ice Palace.The songs are hit or miss, but that's true with a lot of musicals. But to me the two songs that stick out are 'For the First Time in Forever' and my favorite and no surprise 'Let it Go' which is just a beautiful song about just doing what you feel and being yourself.I really like the story in a strange way this fantasy story is also almost like a 'X-Men' tale (if you read the comic series or seen the live action films you know what I'm talking about). But that it's simply a great love story, not so much just between both a guy and and girl which we have, but between siblings.I really like the main character Elisa (voiced well by Idina Menzel). The depth to her character is pretty tragic and you really feel a sense of pathos for her. She's sort of like one of the mutants in the 'X-Men' comic book series. Like the mutants she's born with a special ability, though here it's deemed as magic. Though the main dilemma is she doesn't know how to fully control them nor does she entirely understand them.The poor girl is pretty much forced to being a control freak, she has to constantly keep her powers and emotions in check even from doing the simplest things like keeping a mere pencil from becoming an icicle from picking it up. Or even just touching people as we see her wearing gloves throughout the first half of the film, much like with 'Rogue' on 'X-Men'. One scene that I'll admit is a bit heartbreaking is whenever Anna has always knocked on Elisa's door and asks for her to play but she never comes out. But you can tell from the emotion on her face she really wants to come out but can't because she's afraid she'll harm her again with her powers, despite the fact she already is hurting her; it's just awful it's no way to live.The other character I like and is my favorite is Anna (voiced well by underrated actress Kristen Bell). She is just great, she's beautiful both inside and out. She funny, she has great charisma that is just crackling like fireworks, she has some of the best lines in the film highly energetic and fast moving, and feisty which is a trait I love best. However what make it great is the back and forth between them which I think is beautiful, it's a great sibling relationship even like that one little moment when both of them say 'Choclate' at the same time which was sweet and kinda funny. This good relationship is all the more reason why I want both of them to win because it can be forever if they want it. For Anna it's to somehow get though to Elsa somehow. I love the fact that Anna accepts and loves Elsa for who she is regardless of the fact she has powers, and is doing everything in her power to help her, which to me is part of what love truly is.And personally I felt that's why Elsa powers were getting out of control the powers are connected with her emotions, it was because she wasn't allowing herself to feel things and have or experience certain things in her life. When that happens it usual would bring negative feelings to yourself and a not so positive outlook on life, and her powers are making things bad because she feels bad. It just shows why it good to feel things. As Doctor Number 5 in 'Doctor Who' once said 'Emotions also enhance life.' Even like the two supporting characters: Olaf (voiced by Josh Gad) is surprising a fun, funny, even charming character. Olaf's persona sort of reminds me of Frosty from the Ralkin and Bass 'Frosty the Snowman' Christmas special which is great because this character isn't all laughs but does have heart, just like Frosty he's someone you want to be friends with. But I like that the guy has a dream which is to be in the sun, which is of course impossible but it's easy to emphasize with, we have those kinds of dreams of attaining the unattainable.But the one I like the most is Kristoff. Kristoff isn't a stereotypical pretty boy protagonist, I love the fact he's kinda a underdog, he's pretty much a blue collar worker, doesn't have all the breaks, he doesn't get the girls, he's not too smooth, but he has a good heart, big dreams, and isn't afraid to help or step up when he should. Love the back and forth between both Anna and Kris, which I think is a very good chemistry, the banter between them is fun, funny and warm you already know from this chemistry that both are right for each other which is all the more reason why I want this guy to win; we want Anna with a guy we she knows best.If the film has a message, it's simply about being yourself and not being afraid of what you feel, embrace and express your emotion. But also just simply what true love really is.This film will melt and warm your heart.Rating: 4 stars",10,10,18,17 May 2014
Ghostbusters," There's something strange in the neighborhood
","I'm a kid from the 80's and this was one of the first films I saw, this is one of my all time favorite films. This wasn't just a film it was a phenomenon it had an animated series called 'The Real Ghostbusters' which is one of my favorite animated shows and was the source that lead me to see the film; along with it's underrated sequel series 'Extreme Ghostbusters'. There were also toys, video games, a sequel which I like, comic books there aren't many films now that can really generate this kind of phenomena, especially one just like any great ghost story is timeless.This film isn't entirely concerned about plot, even though there is one the whole film builds up to that the further it goes. It's really focused on the characters and what happens. I really love how it has the proper balance of special effects and comedy, both are used the right way and the right reasons. I really like this fantasy world the film has created where it feels one foot in reality but also one foot away. The special effects are just great because their practical, they've created some memorable ghosts like the trademark ghost Slimer, But the ones that impressed me the most are Gozer and the demon hounds whom are the main villains the film builds up to and they don't disappoint they made me nervous when I was a kid, Gozer having being a god which means limitless power so yeah that's a tough customer. However I also really loved seeing that otherworldly temple behind them which just looks beautiful and eerily strange, reminiscent of something out of Lovecroftian tales. I really love the weapons of the Ghostbusters those proton packs and traps, seeing how they work made me want to get one. And lets not forget the music which is just great there a plenty of memorable songs like the infamous Ghostbusters theme which is no surprise one of my favorites movie themes, however my favorite song in the film is actually 'Save the Day', it's just one of those songs that really make you get going.However it's the characters how they deliver their lines and how they talk to one another that really drives this film. Their funny because they play it straight, their talking and acting like regular people would, and all have unique persona's. We see a barrage of clever jokes, one liners, and quotes that are all delivered at the right timing.Peter Venkman played brilliantly by one of my favorite actors Bill Murray. What I like is the fact that his character has a really sarcastic, smart alec , slightly slacker mannerism (though he could be smart sometimes if he wants to be). He just has a lot of key moments from the time when he interacts with his girlfriend Dana (Sigurney Weaver) who unfortunately is possessed by one of Gozer's demon dogs Zool was really funny, or even a small moment when he encounters Slimer and reacts a bit with nervousness then in the aftermath he delivers that infamous sarcastic line 'He slimed me.' Raymond Stantz: Dan Ackroyd is at his best in this one, shame like with most comedians he never really retained most of that comedic energy again. His character is well a geek, super smart but has a sort of childlike naivety attached to him. I loved that moment when he interacts with Gozer which believe it or not is my favorite quote from the movie; 'As a representative of New York City, I ask you to cease and desist all supernatural activity, and return to your point of origin or the nearest parallel dimension.' I know that seems to be both the smartest and dumbest thing to say, but then again what the heck else can one say to a ancient evil Samarian God.Egon Spenglaer: Harold Ramis plays this character with dry wit. He's basically all brain which might make it a little difficult when it comes to fruitful interaction. Like some of those little moments with Secretary Janine Malniz (Annie Potts) who flirts with him from time to time but never really gets him which I though was sweet and funny in a quirky sense (this of course is built more in both animated series).This film is funny from it's small subtle moments that work in a big way as well as it's big moments that have the equal affect but in a small way (if you catch my drift). One of my favorite moments are Egon's interview with Lousi Tully (Rick Moranis) who is possessed by another demon dog of Gozer's Vince. It's just funny seeing the looks both Janine and Egon display when Vince talks about a couple of Gozer's past forms and what he, she or whatever Gozer was did at the time. Egon and Janine's faces reflect exactly what I'm thinking at that moment 'What in the hell is he talking about.' What Vince says is the truth but just the strangeness of the content and the way his says it is just downright funny.And of course the big moment when the infamous Stay Puff marshmallow man shows up. I just laughed my heard off, obviously a small homage and satirical parody on those big monster movies like Godzilla and King Kong. Mr. Stay Puff is one of my favorite super sized monsters, he's both cutely funny but also menacing and scary at the same time.If you guys have any ghosts, you can call and trust these guys.Rating: 4 stars",10,0,0,4 November 2012
Back to the Future Part III," Go West and Going Home
","This is the final entry in a great sci-fi series, which I think is kind of an underrated sequel, yeah, it's not the best in the series in my book but it has merit, and unlike most movie and TV series it does what most fail to do, conclude on a positive note. The only misfires I have are the pacing comes off just a tad slow, mainly in the middle where not much really happens until the final half which makes the film less exciting. The soundtrack isn't that memorable well except on track by Alvin Silvestri but that's it, probably because country music isn't my genre. Which sort of gets to my other problem which is really just me, the Western genre just isn't my genre it's the same as how I feel about musicals, courtroom genres, and any others I don't get into highly, like there is a western or two I like mainly the TV shows 'The Young Riders' and 'Guns of Paradise' (both 80's shows) even the 80's cartoon show 'Brave Starr' if you want to count it, but that's basically it. That's just how it is with lots of people there is some music or even sports they like or don't like, it's part of what makes us unique. So yeah, that one of the reasons I don't watch this entry too highly.Now that that's aside let's get down to business, I do like the plotline, honestly didn't mind the idea of taking it to the old west which was a different idea and kind of makes sense when you think about it going to the beginning of Hill Valley when both Hill Valley and America were still young and changing, innovations on the rise just budding into fruitation. But also, I like that fact that both the western and sci-fi genre mix, I always love a mix in genre which show you can do more with them. Let alone sci-fi westerns aren't something I see every day, the only ones I can think of are TV shows like 'Brave Starr', 'Galaxy Rangers', and movies like 'Outland', and 'Cowboys and Aliens' all underrated gems.Characters are good as usual, the back and forth between both Marty and Doc is intact. I really like how Doc Brown is a little more the main character of the film this time and for once Marty is more the supporting character, it makes sense having this switch since this is the final entry why not. Doc as usual is just hilarious he has some of the best comedic moments, my favorite is the whole dilemma with the alcoholic drink, I won't say anymore than that you just have to see it yourself it's hilarious. Marty is good as usual, I really like it when he interacts with one of his ancestors Shamus McFly whom is of course played by Michael J Fox, really liked Mike's performance as that character really bought this was a different person, he a bit of another mentor figure for Marty. However, in this film Marty has a subplot where he must learn an important lesson in not giving into dares and what true courage is about, which I thought was good and is somewhat a plot device for the final half of the film.And of course, Bufford Tannen this believe or not is my favorite incarnation of Biff he's as usually a fun dirtbag. His looks reflect his attitude where he is just dirty, grimy, and dangerous as he just seems to have a short fuse and trigger happy as he's ready to blow anyone away that tees him off. However, he's as usual idotic, as we see once again he does some dumb things that even a second grader can easily avoid, let alone intellectually poor as he doesn't even know one number that comes before or even after another.I like the new character Clara played by Mary Steenburgen, it's ironic considering she was in a time travel film in the 80's 'Time After Time' another under the radar gem; so thats two in a row for her not bad. She's a highly intelligent woman whom is interested in science and curious about things in both science and life which makes both Doc and her a good match. The chemistry between both Clara and Doc is solid, I wouldn't say one of the best romances I've ever seen in my book, but I'd take this over any of those crappy ones from a soap anytime. I bought into it because the two were doing what most couples should do interact, though I think what makes this stand out is throughout both their relationship and the adventure Doc actually grows a little becomes a little more of a man as his confidence grows, like seeing him stand up to Bufford Tannen not even afraid as Tannen has a gun on him, it really shows strength in Doc that you can't break his spirit no matter what.There are once again some fun moments. Like seeing Marty in that shooting gallery sequence and seeing him shoot each of the targets and it's funny what he says at the end of that as well as using a pie plate as a frisbee. As well as most of the final half which was were most of the excitement was with the final showdown and the race Back to the Future.But it then of course comes down to the final minutes of the film that I found touch and kind of sad at the same time because it really assured us that this truly is the end of the series. Though I wouldn't fret too much if you want to see the expanded universe 'Back to the Future' adventures there is the comic book series from IDW which are pretty cool. Other than that, I honestly felt this really was a satisfying conclusion to a great sci-fi franchise. I'm going to miss this series, but Marty and Doc have had their final time traveling adventure and rode away into the sunset, so farewell Marty and Doc where ever you go in life and time you never far away.Rating: 3 and a half stars",10,1,1,5 August 2018
Grave of the Fireflies," Childhood Lost
","There are very few movies and very rare times where movies actually made me cry or broke my heart, this is one of those movies and times. This to me is one of the best and most important anime films for me, it's not the easiest movie to watch but afterward it made me appreciate life more than ever.Loosely based off an autobiography of a World War 2 survivor, this film is not just a film it's an emotional experience that has a hold of you from beginning to end. I really love how the animation of the background of Japan in a time long gone, there's sort of a documentary like feel to it from certain cinematography shot of an inanimate object or building it gives you that sense of geography and place. As well as the conditions the town was in, in a time of war from the bombing and the aftermath of them which I found unnerving. The music score is great it has a somber and even tone to it.But of course it's the two characters Seita and Setsuko that drive this film. The way the film handles them is something I rarely see much these days because they don't feel like animated characters they feel like real human beings. What makes this even more heartbreaking is that sense of familiarity to it, their hometown has that feeling like any other hometown that I've lived in. The character Seita I can't help but see a little of myself in because I actually was like him when I was his age. Setsuko is a character that is just about my niece's age. These were one of the reason why I felt heavy pathos for the two but also love them.This is a story about the struggle to survive in times of darkness but also a story about how life truly is precious and none of us ever have as much time as we think. Seita is the older brother who is forced to adulthood so soon as he is doing his best to keep both himself and his younger sister alive but also trying to maintain their childhoods that are beginning to seem far long gone. Setsuko is of course just being what she is a kid and doing what kids would do. As the movie goes one we see both of them afflicted by the cruelty and delusion/stupidity of the selfishness of people, bad conditions that have limited them to things like a disabled economy, government, communications, jobs, and resources. This unfortunately renders most of Seita's efforts to becoming fruitless.There are moments where it's not dark but in a way joyful from the time at the beach both of them were in or even of course trying to catch fireflies, these moments I found precious and important it made me think about certain things I did when I was a child like playing out in a playground or backyard with other kids and the games we play. As Eric Draven from the film 'The Crow' stated 'Nothing is trivial'.But of course there we're moments that were really sad, once scene in particular, from the time when we see the aunt is about to trade their late mom's kimonos for more rice, we see Setsuko try to stop her but it's no use and she just cries. When I saw that or even heard her cry, it just put me in tears just knowing those kimonos were one of the last things she had of her mother, there's even a brief flashback afterward of Seita, Setsuko, and their mom and dad together in a park getting their photo taken making the emotional weight heavier because I knew that was the last time they were all together.It then comes to the final minutes that were haunting and heartbreaking, it made me just break down and cry for the longest time. What makes it all the more heartbreaking was there was nothing I could do about it.Seita and Setsuko will live on in my heart forever, they look to our present, we look to their past and wonder about the future.Rating: 4 stars",10,1,2,26 October 2012
Caddyshack," Golfing Goofballs
","This is another gem from the 80's that I really like. This film is one of my top ten favorite sports comedies number 5 in my book. What really makes this unique to me is the fact that it's one centered on the sport Golf which isn't a sport that is really is filmed much and is cool since I like Golf and am a golfer myself. Though it's understandable why Golf isn't filmed that much as Golf isn't exactly the kind of sport that rings much excitement or involves a lot of action. Yet this film managed to do it very well because of what the characters do on and off the course.Yeah, the film has this plotline on a underdog caddy that has big dreams of going to Law School and is trying to find a better way to get there. It's really not that important, it's a cliché plotline that by it's nature is really a closed line for the comedy. It's really what those other characters do we all pay attention to and is what the film is most concerned about.The music is great this film has some of the best songs once again from Kenny Logins whom always seemed to supply a song or too for a film in the 80's. 
The judge Elihu Smalls by Ted Knight he's a good villain that you love to dislike as he's a snobby dirtbag that despite the accumulation of his wealth can't seem to afford integrity. He's deep down is a person that has a small man complex, hence his last name. He's always trying way too hard at being at the top of everyone else, from social status to just being well liked which he really isn't despite not knowing it.However, the big three in this film are who make the film for me. 
The late great Rodney Dangerfield as Al Czervik this is my favorite role from him. What I really love about his character is the fact that despite being rich, he doesn't act like a stereotypical snob or upper-class blowhole. He's a person that just wants to be himself and have a good time as well as go against the grain, he never cares about what anyone else thinks. From how he dresses wearing a lot of loud t-shirts and not wearing the traditional suit or whatever else golfers and upper classmen wear. He has a flamboyant person where he's not afraid of expressing himself as well as doing whatever he feels like doing. His character just has a lot of the best lines and moments, my favorite is the boat scene where he has a yaut and is coming to the Judge whom has a sail boat that looks flimsy, unfortunately Al doesn't know how to drive it very well and as you can see a lot of hilarity follows.Chevy Chase is good as Ty Webb, he's dryly funny. He's sort of a calm laid back golfer though you see is a bit self-involved and in some spots, he's sort of a slacker at heart. But I like that he really is a friendly guy he's helpful to the caddy giving him some philosophy on life (ok, not always the best kind but hey whatever works) and he likes to play Golf for fun which that what I like doing to. What's really funny is how in the third half of the film when he gets into the tournament we see he's a little nervous which makes his Karma's a bit imbalanced as we see him starting to make some strange spectacular blunders in his skill like shooting a ball straight though a birds beak; on the bright side that would be considered one of the best if strangest shots in golf history.Bill Murray is great as Carl Spackler he's easily my favorite of the three, this was one of his first role and it's deffenatly one of his best. I really like how slobby, crazy and offbeat he is. He has a strange tone to his voice where it's a sounds like a combination of calm, stupidity, and lunacy; His plotline is a live action Looney Tunes where he has to hunt down and kill this rather smart Gopher. I really like that Gopher whom is the mascot of the whole film; he so cute, really like the puppeteering giving the Golfer some personality. As for Bill he just has some of the best darn lines and scenes in the film, from pretending to be a pro golfer by whacking some flowers and announcing the Cinderella Man story to himself. But just his antics in trying to kill the Gopher when he announces his plain at blowing away the golfer it's just comic gold.Caddyshack is on par with hilarity.Rating: 4 stars",10,2,5,28 July 2018
The Dark Knight," Knight of Justice
","Batman to me wasn't just a superhero saga but as a whole it was a tragedy. What makes this film so special to me is that it's not just a great comic book movie adaption it transcends into being actually one of the greats films I've seen ever. Like most sequels this is one of the best and darkest since 'The Empire Strikes Back' I found this sequel both exciting and also a little sad at the same time, but I'm glad none of this afraid to hurt the self esteem of the viewer bull crap this is a real movie.Everything about this film is done right as usual the cinematography of the enviorment which consists of shades of black and grit, and bring out the neo noir quality. Even the action sequences were as usual exciting and great most notably a chase scene which is one of my favorite chase scenes ever because we see the Bat Pod for the first time, it's my favorite vehicle in the franchise I just love how fast it goes as well as it's offensive capabilities I wanted to drive it. But the chase resulted in both Batman and the Joker playing the most interesting game of Chicken I've ever seen (they went two round literally.). And the pacing was just right despite the film being long I was so engrossed in the film that when it ended I didn't even notice how much time passed.However the real joy in this film is really in the drama and characterization. Christian Bale as usual is great as Bruce Wayne/Batman we see in the film he's thinking of hanging up his cape due to the fact that he feels there's another symbol/hero that could bring Gotham more hope and protection then he could but also wants to move on and put closure to his unresolved feelings toward Rachel Dawes (thankfully recast and played well by Maggie Gyllenhaal). But he of course is learning that he may not be able to hand his cape up yet.The other two new characters were great and I felt were real show steelers. Aaron Eckhart is great as Harvey Dent/Two Face. When we see him as Harvey I found him a character I actually like like I could be friends with. He has a great persona, idealistic, and really believes in the law and what he's doing to serve it, this makes us believe in this guy. But as we see his conversion from the good man he formerly was to the mensing super villain we know him to be is tragic and made me feel heavy pathos for him because we know something was robbed form him that he can't get back, his physical condition is a reflection of that but most of all on the psychological scars that won't heal.And of course The Joker played brilliantly band flawlessly by the late great Heath Ledger, he has portrayed not just one of the greatest comic book villains perfectly but has made another one of the greatest movie villains ever in my book. I'll admit he's a really scary villain because as we see he's a psychopathic terrorist, from his dark taunts and mannerism which reminds me of the villain Alex D Large in 'A Clockwork Orange', his face which reflects his damaged psyche two razor slits on his mouth which form a never ending smile (slightly inspired from a German expressionist horror classic 'The Man Who Laughs'), we even get insight as to how he got them which contains truth if not the whole truth about how he got them but show that he's a damaged traumatized person that unfortunately unlike Batman went the path of darkness. I also like how his motives are a bit enigmatic he's a bit like John Rider from 'The Hicher' were it seems like there might be a motive according to the comic series some say he's afflicting people with the same pain he feels just to prove in his sick way his philosophy that Justice doesn't exist if no one can stop what he's about to do or even him. He's doing this to challenge the caped crusader because he has nothing else to do. Or just simply wants to kill lots of people for fun and to get a good laugh. The schemes he cooks up the guy has the mind of a master chess player, he is about twenty moves ahead of the good guys and us which is scary because every time Batman and the rest come close to stopping him there is a card up his sleeve he's hiding. I really like the verbal back and forth both Batman and the Joker have, it was highly intense, you can tell Batman at times is having a hard time keeping his cool with him, I don't blame him I might snap as well if the Joker pressed a wrong button.This film is all about the gray area in ethics and heroism, it's never a one way street and we get no answers. Tehre are limitations or at least should be to what people can or should do to exercise justice, but most of all how we all are capable of doing anything to break those limitations for what we deem as right or wrong. All of the good guys we see are getting pushed toward their ethical and emotional breaking pint. Batman having to utilize a technology that violates privacy laws just to track down the Joker. To Harvey Dent/Two Face in his tragic and painful downfall, he goes against his own ideals for revenge on his enemies that robbed him of something important in his life and made him the way he is.The Dark Kinght has made the Batman mythology shades darker.Rating: 4 stars",10,0,3,29 July 2012
Pride & Prejudice," Love and Misunderstanding
","Despite how much money and treasures one has, it can never fill one's emptiness that needs to be full, that emptiness is love.I'm not a big fan of the romance genre there are very few stories I really like and love. 'Pride and Prejudice' is one of my favorite romance story because it's one of those rare cases of a romance story done the right way of it's sense of honesty, romantic tension and banter, but most of all the universal effect it's had on most other romance stories done right like the TV show 'Castle' as well as the Japaninese Anime TV show 'Macross' which in a way is a sci-fi retelling of the literary story, and plenty more out there and to come.The cinematography and location is great. We see from the wide shots to some medium shots, the look and feel of a 17 century England long ago. From the wide lawn the characters cross, weather conditions, open space of where the houses are located, to the interiors of ballrooms or of the wealthy. One memorable moment in the film that stood in my mind the most like the ballroom scene, when both of them dance with one another and soon everyone else fades from the room, as if both can for a moment see into each others hearts. The music score it is just beautiful just fits into the film perfectly.Thanks to perfect casting everyone seems to portray their characters with accuracy and understand them. Keira Knightly one of my favorite actresses was just perfect as Elesbeth Bennet because she literally is the character. What's there not to love about her; Liz is beautiful inside and out from her intellectual interest in books and art, she never lacks courage, has some fire in her, prideful, funny, and kind. Matthew Macfadyen as Mr.Darcy is portrayed just right; brooding, just as interested in the same things as Liz, prideful also, but a bit of an loner and shy, which is why on the surface he looks a bit stiff. One moment with him which I always thought was funny was when he walks in a room immediately to talk to Liz but he kinda chokes in the moment by not saying anything or just can't think of anything to say he even looks like he was going to sweat, and then just walks out quickly like he's going to run. I thought that was funny because it was true I've been there a few times before, to some talking to someone of the opposite sex for the first time is easy but to people like Darcy and me that are men of few words not so much. Though it really is easy by nature it just doesn't look that way at first.Consciously both think they dislike each other, yet subconsciously both have an undying attraction and fascination with one another. Even though LIz says she swore to loath Darcy for all eternity she doesn't really take her words seriously. That feeling of dislike is really nothing more than a mask for what they both really feel for each other which is love. Like most of Austin's stories the pacing does come off a bit slow but you get use to it because it helps in order to create a suspenseful but gradually build up. We want both of them to get together but like in most romances they have to go through common obstacles like totalitarian like restrictions, personal politics, or even falling in love with the wrong people in the guise of the right person. As well as the steps of taking off that mask of theirs and learn to like and love one another. It's a matter of patience but it's well rewarded and leaves us with a good feeling which is something I don't get much. True love is closer than we think.Rating: 4 stars",10,0,2,23 June 2012
This Is Spinal Tap," Heavy Metal Fools
","Part of what makes comedy great is that it is truthfulness but in a comical and exaggerated tone, which makes it both relatable but also joyful at the same time to take in. This is not just one of my favorite comedies but also one of my favorite films in general. I remember when I was a kid I actually thought this was a real heavy metal rock band, though the fake band did have a few albums and do some real tours for a while if you can believe that.This is my favorite film from Rob Reiner, it was the first film or at least one of the first films that created the comedy subgenere mockumentry which didn't entirely caught on till at lot latter with TV shows like 'The Office (UK and US versions)', 'Parks and Recretation', and 'Reno 911'. To me this was a brilliant idea the combo of both the comedy and documentary genre, the beauty of this is how in a way it's sort of a blurring the line with both reality and non reality, but also a way of simply keeping comedy along with comedic characters within reality.The film parodies but also homages and a bit of a love letter to the music scene, from the heavy metal bands but most notably 'The Bettles'. The cinematography is great it's pretty much the documentary style, it really felt like we weren't watching a movie so much but an actually documentary, it really almost looked as though this band might have existed. The music is great, it's memorable, fun and actually funny when you think about the content.But of course the three Spinal Tap band members are just fraking hilarious, all three of them are practically dorks and well fools but in a good way. They pretty much like kids or teenagers that dress up cool and try to act cool and yet they aren't. The band isn't really that good at what they do; even though their songs are fun, in the real life Heavy Metal world I wouldn't exactly call them slammin classics. My favorite song is 'Hellhole' if you listen to the whole song or seen the music video on it, it is one big contradiction as if the person who wrote it might have changed his mind while he wrote part of the middle and end of the song, or someone else stepped in and wrote those parts at the last minute.All three mainly Nigel and David can be a bit childish sometimes like in one scene that cracks me up was when Nigel complains about having finger food bread instead of full sliced bread because he simply can't fold a piece; did it ever occur to him to simply stop at a grocery store and buy a loaf.Yet you really like all three band members and even care about them because their hearts are in the right place, if not their heads. These are people that have a dream/s but most importantly just want to do what they love play music.Even like the manager Ian, whom is dryly hilarious. I really like how gruff he really is and just how much grief he sometimes receives from the band as he is trying to coop with what demands some of them have and making things work despite rolling his eyes a bit in the process. This is an easy attitude to emphasize with if you ever were a manager and there was an amount of chaos or uncoroporation you had to deal with. I even like the fact that he has a cricket bat which despite random I thought was a funny quark to him, he uses it as a way to remind him of his roots and also vent some frustration.The dialog the characters have along with Ian is great, this film just so rich in verbal humor that you would have to see more than once to uncover more. Even some of the visual humor is great, my favorite was seeing the cover art of each of their albums which is deliciously bad and I feel a beautiful combo of both visual and verbal humor together.What I also like is that there is some truth in the film, from little things like a scene where the band gets lost trying to find the main stage which is true, it would really help if those back auditoriums had a visual directory because their real big and easy to get lost in. Even that worst fear all bands and performers carry, on things going wrong we see actually do for Spinal Tap, like the Stonehenge concert which well lets just say made, rock history.Spinal Tap rocks, well sort of.Rating: 4 stars",10,1,4,23 March 2015
Home Alone 2: Lost in New York," Christmas Vacation Calamity
","This is another of my favorite sequels, childhood gems and an honorable mention in favorite Christmas films. I remember seeing this in the theater, to me it was one of the best times I ever had in the theater as it was just a festival of up roaring laughter. Yeah, it's true this sequel doesn't surpass the original, but I don't feel it's trying to, and yes it's not perfect but it has it where it counts because like with the original it sets itself out for what it wants to be holiday fun.What I like about the sequel is it has sort of an adventurous feel to it, as we see Kevin is out of his comfort zone and is in a fascinating but strange land. Once again there is sort of that wish fulfilment fantasy tale, as we as kids and even adults have dreamed of having that perfect Christmas vacation someplace, we want and having the time of our life our way. Like seeing Kevin ordering room service eating Triple Scooped ice cream sundae and he says one of my favorite lines, 'make it triple, I'm not driving' wonder if any kids or adults thought about saying that whenever they ordered ice cream for room service, on a side note, would love to try that hotel's ice cream.We see Kevin once again watching a sequel (ironically) to that gangster film from the first movie. It's just hilarious as we see once again Johnny whom as usual has an explosive temper. He says another favorite quote, 'I believe you, but my Tommy Gun don't!' damn this guy has serious anger management issues. On a side note, there were some other R rated films Kevin saw that were stacked up beside the one he is watching, shame there wasn't a scene or two to see what those films are.I really like that we get to see some of New York if not a whole lot which is one little weak point of the film. From that hotel which is a real hotel I'd someday like to find so I can visit the location of where the film was filmed. We even see him go to a place called Dunkins Toy Chest which is nice looking, though the place has no toys nor even a video game department, it looks more like a 'Hallmark' store which is weird; Kevin should've requested 'Toys R Us', damn I miss that place in fact toy stores in general.Music is good there is the same memorable score by John Williams and some new track one song I really like that's became a Christmas favorites are 'Christmas Tree' (the version where Buzz didn't frak things up) and 'Distant Goodnights' which I'll admit really has a sweet but sorrowful feel. There is one scene that is a bit of a heartstring pull as both Kevin and his mom say good night to each other from a distance, it reminds us and Kevin despite all the fun and games, he's still unhappy deep down and misses his family just as his mom feels guilt once again bears the burden of guilt and misses him.Characters are good, Kevin as usual is Kevin whom to me is the master trickster. Once again, he's on the sympathetic side as he can never seem to catch a break with his family. He once again gets punished for something he really isn't guilty of. Buzz (somedays I really hate that guy) whom as usual is being a idiot decided to play a prank on Kevin in the entire school. Personally after that stunt, if I was the director of that production I would kick Buzz out, you pull crap like that in every production you don't get to perform and seriously McCallister family stop being so leanant toward Buzz that's probably what lead him to doing stupid crap in the first place; sorry this sounded bold but I had to get that out. And once again Karma is on Kevin's side as he gets to have the time of his life.But one thing I really like that Kevin has is the Talk boy, which I thought was cool at the time, this was way before phone app tech. It's basically a tape recorder, but it has a mike and a way to manipulate your voice to sound like an anonymous voice dub. This device no doubt comes in handy for Kevin throughout the film and it would be cool if they made a 'Home Alone Talk boy' app where we can recreate those features.Tim Curry one of my favorite actors is great as the Concierge. He's almost the subordinate villain in film, ok not really, more of just your obstacle. He's a guy that is completely uptight, really wants to run the hotel like a tight ship. But a little on the egocentric side as he really wants to bust Kevin to both keep his hotel intact but also to inflate his ego. It' s just funny the certain reaction he has toward Kevin's trick which crack me up.The Wet Bandits or Sticky Bandits whichever you prefer, as usual are themselves, they haven't changed as both are still nincompoops. I like the fact that this time they've stepped up their game as their now robbing stores instead of houses. This plan would work if it wasn't for one poison pill in the plan which they're at fault for taking which is a weak point I'll get to latter. But these guys are funny as usual, from their typical back and forth and the spills they rightfully take.The humor as usual is hilarious just spot one, from another scene with the Concierge and his company when they go to Kevin's room they are once again duped by one of Kevin's tricks as he is playing the Gangster pic loud. I won't give away what happens next you just must see it yourself it's just hilarious.
But of course, down to the final battle which is a physical humor/slapstick comedy fest and even more violent and painful than before. I won't give too much away on that I'll just state a couple of the traps.The first one is of course the beginning of the battle, where the robbers stupidly think Kevin will corroborate in throwing down the camera and Harry says another of my favorite lines though was common at the time, 'I cross my heart and hope to die.' I snickered when he said that because it's like he's practically telling Kevin to take him out. And of course, Kevin throws down something toward them, lets just say his Christmas gift to Marv.Another of course is the electrocution scene which I was just laughing my head off toward, that one is sort of a live action 'Looney Tunes' gag. Just hearing Marv's screams was just music to my ears. But we also see his skeleton as he's being shocked. Another that's sort of a Looney Tunes gag is the teeter totter which cracks me up, but it cracks me up even more the fact that Harry wasn't smart enough to get off it immediately, yeah fast one Harry.But this sequel does miss a trick or two that really holds it back a little for me, I'll just state a few. I don't like how there are some moments of stupidity that I felt could easily have been avoided in the writing. Like that mis boarding scene, I don't like how that was handled. The whole battery thing was stupid and a cheap device, seriously Kevin couldn't wait to get on board to replace his batteries. Personally, it should have been some sort of holiday rush riot where it was not just the McCallister family but every other family and group that was rushing to their planes and somehow Kevin gets lost in that crowd. Let alone the stupidity of the Robbers whom had a good plain and would have succeeded if they just left Kevin alone, which I'll admit is a plot hole.There are also a few too many coincidences, from the Robbers being in New York the same time Kevin came. Or Kevin's uncle and aunt having a place they were renovating that happens to be in New York. I do believe in coincidences, but this is just too big to swallow. Didn't like the whole gun thing with Harry and Marv, it felt out of place and out of character.The film doesn't quite bring much new to the table as it has that fundamental problems some sequels have, where it does seem just a bit like the same film in places just dressed differently make the film a tad predictable; though same could be said for certain slasher franchises out there like the 'Friday the 13th' films but that didn't make them bad (or not all of them) so I can't complain too much on that.I honestly didn't care for the bird lady character, she not a bad character but by her nature she really a filler character that I could take or leave but all the same really there to fill in empty space and time much like Harry on 'Doctor Who'.If Kevin was suppose of have a secondary character along the way it either should have been one of the members of his family which would have been interesting, it would help shed light as to who that family member is in the multitude of members as well as provide depth on the family but may 'be further the stakes for Kevin as he not just has to protect himself but a member of his family, but it would help make the film a little different sort of like a buddy buddy film, could of also meant extra traps see this other member's tactician skills. I don't know it's a nice thought, anyway, shame it was never considered.Overall, despite being one of those mixed bag movie/sequels I still had fun with this film which really is most of the time all I can ask for sequels. 'Home Alone 2' like any holiday vacation is worth a trip.Rating: 3 stars",8,1,4,22 November 2019
How to Train Your Dragon," Dragon Rider
","Dragons have always been my favorite creature in the fantasy genre; it's hard to say why may'be the fact they can breath fire, their size, or just simply their ability to fly. Seeing things like that makes it feel as though there is more to this world than just contemporary reality we take for granted. There really aren't many movies on dragons, let alone good ones; this film that flew into my radar was the beast I was looking for.The visuals and the animation is just great. From the background, humans but most importantly the dragons. The dragons are memorable they don't look cartoony, I like the great amount of detail to them but also that each of them are diverse. But I most of all just love how their handled making them like animals; from the way they move, but also behave and each of them feel like they have a distinctive diverse persona.The flight sequences are spectacular, they successfully created the illusion of flight at times you almost feel like your flying with them. My favorite flight sequence is the one with both Astrid and Hiccup flying together, just what you see along with a wonderful score it's just breathtaking.But what makes this film fly high for me is that the story does have some heart, which actually makes you care for what happens. I also like the fact this film is more of a straight forward fantasy and not so much a comedy despite some humor which is something I'm rarely seeing in most animated movies. Hiccup (Jay Barnchel) I think is a very good protagonist, I like the fact his character is an underdog, doesn't really fit in. But what's great about him is the fact he's a person ahead of his time, he's an inventor kinda like 'Batman' (I said kinda). From that siege weapon he built but also the flight controls he built for the dragon and it's aero dynamic principles. Insightful as he finds and utilizes better and more non lethal ways to stop the dragons, without one or both getting killed. He's ill confidant but he's never short of courage.Supporting characters are also good, the one that really stands out for me is Astrid (America Ferrera) I just love how she is just feisty and fiery but has warmth. I really like the chemistry between both of them; it's funny how at first like in most romances it's the classic case of misunderstanding she sees Hiccup has sort of a competitor thinking he's trying to one up, even though in reality he really isn't and he fancys her. But of course when she's disillusioned by the misunderstanding , well you can guess what happens next.But the primary chemistry no doubt is with the dragon Toothless, he's my favorite dragon in the movie. I just love the jet black color, but most of all his design as he looks even acts a bit like a cat. I really like the persona it has, one distinct personality feature it has is it's sense of curiosity as it observes some of what Hiccup does he tries to imitate it, this feature is one of the reasons both of them click is Hiccup is also curious which was part of the reason he helped the dragon. Both of them slowly but surely warm up to each other which is touching because of the amount of humanity both have.How to Train you Dragon flies high.Rating: 3 and a half stars.",9,0,0,15 December 2012
Total Recall," Life is but a dream.
","Dreams and reality are always in conflict because the line gets blurred so easily and there isn't a real way to be sure. I'll admit I've actually had several instances where I thought that my dreams were actually the real world and then when I woke up I was confused if I really woke up to reality or if I'm still dreaming. This film is one of my personal favorite sci-fi movies everything about it is just great let alone the fact it's based on one of the short stories from my favorite sci-fi author Philp K. Dick.Everything about the film is just great from the production value, everything is practical from make up to set pieces there is very little CGI and when the CGI is used it looks great because it looks real. This film to me is one of the best examples of effects and CGI used the right way, well and for the right reasons. One favorite effect of mine is the Robot mask sequence, the mask was practically a three dimensional puzzle, I love how we see it come apart and put itself together. But most importantly I just love the world of the future created because it feels possible and plausible, some concepts are slightly prolific on what we have now. Like the concept that we've been able to colonize planets and are able to travel to them as an everyday convenience. But also the technology mainly the Recall machine which is an interesting and fascinating concept because it's the ability and freedom to create memories and identity anyway you want, let's say I decided my memory vacation would be New York City and I gave myself the identity role of a superhero Batman and I was in some ongoing situation and kicking butt, I would really believe I was Batman at that point in time because that dream vacation is part of my memories. The action sequences are great their all well choreographed and practical plenty of gore effects, like one of my favorite shootouts was in the alien plant and Quaid was using the hologram as a decoy, it was great because even I was fooled sometimes let alone it's sort of acts as an irony to the theme of the film. But also the infamous scene of seeing both Melina and Lori fight, it was a short fight but still it was fun because of just how well choreographed and slightly realistic it was and just the fact two strong hot women were fighting is a turn on for me (seriously I don't know why it just is). The music score is great by one of my favorite composers the late great Jerry Goldsmith, the theme song is one of my favorite themes ever it's an adventurous epic tone.And the characters are great. To me Douglas Quaid is my favorite role from Arnold Schwarznagger. Not just do we like the character Quaid because he can kick butt and has charisma, but that he's actually sympathetic. Throughout the film you see him just completely disoriented with everything happening around him and is struggling to make sense of it but is unable to because there are so many twists and turns and nothing to nobody is what it seems. One moment where I really sympathize with him was in getting jumped by spies and suddenly he starts fighting and killing the guys, after the battle is over he looks at his hands in shock over what he's done. You can clearly see in his eyes he's thinking the same thing we are, 'how in the hell did he do that.' I like Melina (Rachel Ticotin) she's like the common femme fatale in thrillers one to help the hero and fall in love with, she's hot and has the persona and fighting skills to boot. Even the villains are great other than Lori (Sharron Stone) whom was great as the typical deceptive dangerous femme fatale to foil the protagonist. Cohagen (Ronny Cox) whom is a ruthless CEO that rules Mars with an iron fist as well as make big profits at the cost of lives. But to me the villain that stands out is Richter played well by one of my favorite actors Michael Ironside, he's just a right hand man that is just so ruthless and hell bent on wanting to kill Quaid for no apparent reason it just seems like he hates his guts, may'be both had some bad blood in the past I don't know. He's menacing because of his unbending determination to kill him, he's willing to kill anyone in the way if it means he has a clear shot. He's kinda fun/funny because there is this really black sense of charisma or dry humor to his character.It tackles the existential philosophical concepts on what is reality as well as what is identity. It really is trippy when you think about it, whenever you wake up everything is always the same except the day which always changes and with every tomorrow we always add more to our identity or discover things about ourselves we didn't think existed. And how much about our past can we really remember, there are times when there is conflicting viewpoints on how we remember certain event of our life, another at that event may remember and viewed it differently, or it just didn't happen at all.So are we in reality or dreaming, it's really up to you.Rating: 4 stars",10,1,4,27 July 2012
Les Misérables," Bittersweet Destiny
","I'll level with you I'm not a fan of the musical genre, it's just not my genre. There are very few I like because they pertain to my interests, for me my fav is 'Doctor Horrible's Sing Along Blog'. But this is one of those rare exceptions because it really is one that has you going though the motions, it truly is both touching and downright heartbreaking at the same time. It's also one of the few films that I actually cry to which is rare for me.I really love the production value, the set pieces are great recreating a country in both it's glory and ruin in times long gone. The songs are great and memorable, it's almost hard to pick which are my favorites I'll just pick three of them. Number three, 'I Dream the Dream' this is a sad but beautiful song because it's about optimism coming to an end. Number two it's 'One More Day' as we see different characters, what their doing today and what their thinking about tomorrow. But of course my favorite is 'Do You Hear the People Sing' it is just an epic and uplifting song almost makes you want to sing.However for me what really powered the film was both the characters and the story. The story I felt was great I like the fact that at times it almost kinda a Christan story. There were some Christ like parallels as well as some themes on existence, finding the right path, doing onto others, belief and hope.The characters on my list I really like each have a parallel with each other but one thing in common and that is all of them are struggling for existence in a unfair and unfit society.Anne Hathaway was great in her small role as Fantine whom just really has it bad, you really feel for her doing what she can to keep her daughter and even her dreams alive.Hugh Jackman whom is an actor I really like (yeah, I'm a fan of X-Men 1 and 2)I felt was really great as Jean Valjean. He's also a character you really feel pathos for because this guy just had it bad and didn't deserve it. I really love the fact that he not just was able to pick himself up in the world proving he's not a man defined by label. But really how selfless he is, he is never a person thinking about himself, he's always getting out of his way for the sake of the other.Marius played well by Eddie Redmayne he's a character I like. He's a good guy whom is rebellious and a little naive but in a good way. One thing I really like about his character is just like Jean doesn't let class or labels define him. Though his circumstances are different from the rest because he use to be a person that lived in the upper class. But life there wasn't roses and cream for him, his family was hardly warm or loving, and they cut him off all because he wanted to go his own way in life and the people he befriends are from the lower class most notably Eponine.Cosette played well by Amanda Seyfried is pretty and kinda cute. She's sweet has a slight naivety to her, she is a character of sympathy just like Jean before she had it good she had it really bad. You of course see her childhood, she's forced to live away from her mom and works for this rotten greedy family that gives her practically nothing not even a doll as you see she had only a mop strain doll so that really sucks. It makes me grateful that she now has grew up well, has a good life and the bad one behind her. I do like her chemistry with Marius both do click well and it feels right both deserve each other despite what I feel about Eponine which I'll get to latter.Though for me my favorite character is Eponine played flawlessly by Samamtha Barks whom I think is so fraking hot. Eponine was just a character I fell in love with. Just like with Jean and Corsette she grew up on the wrong side of the tracks with the lousy parents the Thenardiers, surprisingly she didn't grow up to be anything like them and it once more demonstrates my point. But she is just beautiful inside and out, she's sweet also but I like that she's a little feisty. I really love the chemistry between both Marius and her, both characters were childhood friends which makes the feel for both more genuine. And is also part of why I felt the most pathos for her because her character sees Marius as more than just a friend, she loves him. Don't get me wrong I do like both Marius and Corcet together but personally I felt Eponine and him would of been a better match. And that's what makes it all the more heartbreaking, you can just see her aching for him, having these feeling for him she want's to bring out but is unable to because she fears hurting him but worst of all he just doesn't feel the same way about her. This is something I can emphasize with because this is something that's happened to me a couple of times in my life, so yeah I understand it too well. There is one scene with her I won't say what it is but it made my heart shatter into pieces and actually break down and cry.Well I've said enough, dream of better days and surely they will come.Rating: 4 stars",10,5,8,26 February 2013
The Shape of Water," Love Runs Deep
","One of the best things for me about the fantasy genere is the romance aspect. Most of the best love stories come from this genere, I feel though it we have not just more creative freedom but the freedom to express what we geniuely feel. It's also expresses our deep seeded believe that someone somewhere is one for us and the struggle we go though to find and stay with them.Del Toro is one of my favorate movie directors and believe or not this is my favorate movie from him and one of my favorate films in general. This is another kind of film I can't help but feel was almost made for me as it has three of the things I love in most movies; monsters, fantasy, and romance. The premise isn't exactly anything new but it's really more in it's execution that makes it stand out.There are just so many great things from the cinematography and production value which is great. I really like how it recreated early 1960s era which was a time of chaos from bigotry and intolerance on all sides but also great change as minorities were struggling for equal rights. Music is just fantastic, the orchastratic score is just beautiful as it just perfectly captures what's happening but most importantly the feelings of both Eliza and the Creature and who they are as characters. However the best thing for me is the song 'You Never Know' which is just wonderful and perfectly reflects the relationship.Characters are great from the supporting charcters; Richard Jenkins and Octavia Spencer are great as Eliza's friends, there is great back and forth between them but I like how well rounded both characters are as we get some depth on them to show the commonality all three have as each of them are struggling and dealing with intolerance on all fronts and forms.Michael Shannon is good as a villain you plain hate as he is a monster in the guise of authority. Theres an interesting character study about him is we get depth into his diseased psyche as he is literally a product of his time, a man living on fixed notions on what a person is supposed to be, which justifies why change or anything different that threats his infastruction shouldn't be aloud. But little does he know or a creeping awareness is he's just part of a dying breed because all those notions are bull crap, despite all the things he has in his life like the teal Cadalac, the whole American dream package he's never content because it's all materialistic there is nothing spiritually going on in his life which makes him spiritually empty.But of coruse what really makes this film are both Eliza and the Creature. Elsa and the Anphibian Creature are another one of my favorate fictional couples in my book up there with Misa and Hikaru in 'Macross' and many others on my list, because like any romance story done right I actually care about both characters. The chemistry between both of them is just beautiful, I really was invested into their connection, despite their differences their feelings for each other are human.Sally Hawins is just great as Eliza, it's probably my favorate role from her. I'll level with you I actually have a crush on this actress believe or not. Sure she doesn't look like someone from the damn CW which makes it all the better. Personally I think she's beautiful inside and out, I really love here character and she's relatable as I'm not a person that talks much either. Despite a lonely soul, her mute condition and not living in the greatest circumstances she never lets it get her down, she's socialable, she has dreams, even like that she knows how to have fun as we see her display some dancing talent.The Anphibian Creature is great played of coruse by make up and costume actor Doug Jones. The design is great it's all practically there's no CGI bull crap, it really looks like something that could really exist. The creature is a fascinating character despite a mute and not much depth but I find sometimes what you don't say you say a lot. I love that there is mystery to him as you wonder if it's one of the meza god's from Mayan Legend, the God Nepturn from Greek Mythology, a creature seen or even worshiped from the lost civilizations like Atlantis or may'be even the mermaid creatures we heard of from fairy tales, as well as certain abilities of his which show as Shakespere put it 'There are more things in heaven and earth.' However it's really in it's behavior that makes us really connect and sympathize because his childlike curiousity and feelings make him very human.What makes the chemistry truly unique is that it's non verbal which to me is the best approach; it avoids a fundamental problem most romance films have where sometimes both characters go into a bunch of meaningless melodramatic prattle that really dampins the story. Personally in romance stories I find the quiet physical expression the best parts because both characters are expressing what they truly feel for one another.
Despite communicated in silence you can hear them loud and clear from not just their sign language but also just physicality which made the connection all the more genuine and beautiful. As Old Pete once said, 'If love is really true, it doesn't need an answer.'There are a lot of beautiful moments between the two like two scenes seeing both Eliza and him underwater together, which was like seeing a dance from how they move and float together. And there is one dream sequence which was great as it's a throwback to some of the old Hollywood musicals, let alone suprising seeing Sally sing and dance which I knew nothing about.The film does a good job at touching upon the issue of racism as well as other themes like the power of indiviuals and miniorities over corrupt powers and the infaststures built on their lies, the meaning of true humanity. But most importantly the universality of love and how there are no barriers or differences.Elsa and the Creature's love for each other just like the depths of the ocean runs deep.Rating: 4 stars",10,43,84,3 January 2018
It's a Wonderful Life," One Life Matters
","The strangest thing about life is how much one person can really be a importantly link to a whole. Whether it's by free will alone, divine design/power, or even both it will never been known, what is known are the results that one person does which can be extraordinary and part of what creates the whole. This is a Christmas/fantasy film I really like that I can come back to every once in a while. It really is a film that actually is pretty dark but also does in a way make you feel good, but most importantly causes you at times to evaluate your own life.There really isn't much I can really say that hasn't already been said. What really matters is the story itself which like all great stories despite how much time has passed it is timeless. The film in a way is kinda a Christian film since there are some Christian themes as well as influence that intervenes.George Bailey is kinda a Christian hero, and like most of them you actually feel a sense of heavy pathos for the guy. The guy had to unfortunately put all his dreams on hold, all to do the right thing for others. I like that he's a bit reluctant, he doesn't really want to be selfless, nor does he even enjoy doing the right thing which I'll admit is something I can emphasize with from time to time. However all the same he does it whether he wants to or not because there is no one else that will, or is even strong enough to. Like with most of Capra's films, they have one thing in common showing that being a good person isn't always the easiest thing to be.Even though George doesn't look like he has all the breaks, personally I think he does, his life actually is pretty good, he's got lots of friends, he's not boring, is active does things with himself, sure not the biggest adventure or exactly an event a minute. To me I always believed sometimes the smallest adventures are biggest, because of what you do during your lifetime. Unlike the antagonist Mr. Potter whom really just like his riches he holds doesn't do jack squat with himself, I can understand where the guys misery originates from but it's no excuse nor give him the right to ruin anyone elses life.Other than the drama, I really like the fantasy aspect which was the first or one of the first times they ever constructed an alternate scenario. This is a common place format now done in many TV shows even comic books, but this film was one of the first and I feel still the best. The alternate scenario I felt was believable because it sort of plays out the notion that we all think of everyday, what if we were out of the picture, or we made that decision instead, or did that. Indeed it would of been a very different world, and of course we see this world without Geroge which is practically a cesspool as we see the blowhole Mr. Potter has fraked up bad. It really is disturbingly believable as George and we see how miserable most residents are, grungy and dirty Bedford falls is, the people that have been deceased because he wasn't around.The film has two really good messages, the first on the importance of exercising selflessness, it not just benefits the people around you but yourself as a person. But also about valuing your life that it really does matter whether you live or die, because of how much it is connected and affect the whole.One person does matter because one can do a whole lot in a single lifetime.Rating: 4 stars",10,4,9,4 December 2013
Mr. & Mrs. Smith," Spy vs. Spy
","Couples to me are never really entertaining to me without friction. It's hard to say why, may'be it's because though friction both are able to exercise certain emotions and feelings they never can never express to other or themselves.This is an action film that I think is just a bit under the radar. OK not exactly but as time went on it has became a bit forgotten, which is a strange thing to say.I really love the concept which I think is colorful idea for an espionage story but also a romance story if you can believe that. Yeah I know it seems like a bit coincidental a one in a million shot that two superspys or assassins would meet and fall in love. But cmon this is a movie, and hey like all coincidences whose to say it can't happen.I really like the fact that this is an espionage/hit-man movie that is actually fun and personally their the kind I like because they make the intrigue move a lot faster and have more creative freedom, the only other film I can think of is 'Grose Point Blank' another under the radar gem. I also like the fact that is one of those romance film to me that work because this is a could that are adults and are in a long time relationship.This film is pretty much almost a live action version of Mad Magazine's Spy vs. Spy which was simply about one trying to kill the other in different colorful clever ways, which is something both of them are doing throughout most of the film.I really like the dialog and the dry witty humor and there is a lot of it. Like in a neighborhood party sequence I can't help but chuckle a little as we see both are kinda board which just shows how the suburban existence doesn't' really suit both of them, their both out of place which is a feeling I can emphasize with it make no sense doing what you don't want to do. Or even my favorite which is the dinner between both John and Jane as it's really a game of psych out, trying to draw out But I just love the chemistry between both John and Jane, both of course played well by Brad Pitt and Angeline Jolie both one of my favorite actors, having both of them together was at the time something I never thought would happen (I said at the time)so this was kinda a dream come true for me.It's true we don't truly know both John and Jane fully, but that's the point. Both are spys/assassins after all, hence their first names. But I also think that's what makes both their characters all the more interesting, knowing too much about a character to me makes the well of interest run dry. The reason both are on the rocks are the fact that both haven't been 100% honest with one another, simple misunderstandings, but also that they've forgotten those feelings from the past.It's kinda funny and suspenseful as we see both are just clashing once the cat is out of the bag on who they both really are. You could say in a way it's a blackly humorous metaphor on how couples work out their problems with one another (well sort of); both John and Jane really take it to the next level in this film. But despite the conflict there feelings for each other are reigniting making both their feelings and the conflict even more hotter. Despite how hard both are fighting they don't hate each other, heck in each snafu they devised after another on each other they couldn't kill each other that should say something to both of them.And both we can see are the same, I like how we see a parallel contrast between them as we get a glimpse at both their secret agencies which in a way are sort of two schools of espionage. John's is pretty much more low key sort of looks like an old detective agency like you'd see in the noirs or the old spy novels, while Jane's is more high tech and up to date like CTU in the TV show '24'. It's also kinda funny how Jane's agency consists only of women but no men which is kinda strange but also a homage joke to the TV show 'Charlies Angels' they also have a unseen boss whom is only a voice on a phone (cameo voiced by Keith David whom is another favorite actor of mine). But this also makes the conflict sort of a clash of the sexes and two schools of espionage action.The action sequences I think are great and memorable. From the fight at some Wal-Mart like store which is one of my favorite battles, I always love battles that take place in those areas because their colorful, have all kinds of places to hide but also any items you need.However the most memorable battle and to me personally is one of my favorite one on one battles is of course seeing both Jane and John shoot it out and duke it out in their own home. I really like how the gunfight and even the fistfight is choreographed in that sequence because it takes place in a condensed space, though it doesn't look too fancily choreography which makes it almost a bit realistic mainly the fist fight if you can believe that. It's also a bit suspenseful because it really feels like a 50 50 battle it could be anyones game.It is said friction is what creates fire. And these two have made a forest fire.Rating: 3 and a half stars",9,4,7,24 June 2014
Die Hard," High Thrills and Hard to Kill
","One of the things I love about action films is just like with the suspense thrillers it plays with all the what ifs, where something that most likely wouldn't happen or are considered unthinkable does and from this two questions are asked, 'if ever put under the spot how would we deal with the situation?' and 'is it possible to survive and win?'This film is one of my favorite movies of all time, but also, it's my second favorite action film of all time. And of course, one of my favorite Christmas movies. I remember seeing this when I was an adolescent it blew me away, even today I still have lots of fun watching. Heck, even watching the trailer for this film is lots of fun, with that music going on and hearing some of that narrative from the late great Don Lamonte, he always had that great voice for ad narration and is something I sorely miss in trailers.And this film wasn't just another 80's action film it was a phenomenon where this film has established itself as a subgenre in the action genre as many other films throughout the year and TV episodes have utilized the format like the movie 'Under Siege' and the underrated 'Toy Soldiers' but that's and many others are different stories. Even has a few video games, two of them are good like 'Die Hard Trilogy' for PS1 and 'Die Hard Arcade'. There were even two pre sequel comics from Boom Studios based on John McClane that are surprisingly good. And even most recently a tabletop game that is cool.I really love the plotline; from the way it's conducted it feels plausible; who's to say it can't happen or no criminal organization has every had this in the back of their minds.The characters are great there are a lot of colorful characters.Karl played by late and underrated actor Alexander Godunov whom is a solid subordinate villain as he is just throughout the film from beginning to end, hellbent in liquidating McClane. It's just interesting how as the film gets further along the more this guy's cool and sanity is just melting faster than the polar ice caps.And of course, the late great Alan Rickman one of my favorite actors is great as Hans Gruber, this is one of my favorite roles from him and he's an honorable mention in favorite fictional villains. The Hans Gruber character isn't really a deep character as he's more of an archetypal villain but I think it was really in Alan's performance that makes him stand out, from the sharp German accent that you feel ever word could almost cut you like a knife.He's a villain that is just constantly in control, much like a chess player he is a step or two ahead as he already has an elaborate plan in action. But he's very cold, calculating, and ruthless he isn't afraid to off anybody that gets in the way or tries to ruin his scheme. But also the guy has a dry charisma which means he's got some memorable lines and humor but in a different way, one line that makes me snicker is 'I read about them in Time magazine.' , I know small line but once you see the scene you'll know why it's funny.Supporting characters are good like Officer Dwight whom is played by the late and underrated actor Paul Gleason. He's is someone you just love to dislike as he is pretty much that stereotypical jerk police chief whom we see is constantly trying to oversee the situation but it really not in charge of jack squat. What's funny about him is that he's practically a moron, but I do like that he at least tries to help despite not good at it.And there is of course Sergeant Al Powell played well by Reginald VelJohnson, whom I always call the character Carl Winslow as that is that actors signature character from the TV show 'Family Matters' as both characters are kind of the same. Anyway, really like how he really provides support for John by keeping him up to date on what's going on the ground as well as provide some intelligence from John about the perpetrators. But just like the back and forth between both of them which is touching and gives the film the buddy cop element, but here it's different because it's a long distance friendship; I thought that was cool because it's something different that don't see in that sub-genre.But of course, it's the protagonist himself we love and are here for. Bruce Willis whom is an honorable mention in favorite actors in my book is great as John McClane, this is my favorite role from him, it's practically his signature role and John is sort of an honorable mention in favorite fictional heroes.At the time he wasn't your typical or conventional action hero as he wasn't a man of muscle or not much muscle, let alone had the greatest set of fighting skills but that's part of why this action hero is great is because he's you everyday guy which made him somewhat relatable and shows how you don't have to be a man of muscle to kick ass.One of the things this action hero has going for him is his sharp, witty, wise cracking charisma; this character just has lots of funny and memorable lines; he's much like Deadpool as he just keeps the jokes and lines coming. This in a way really helps in keeping his cool as well as being able to think straight under a highly stressful situation.I even like how human the guy is as we get some depth into him, as we see his marriage is on the rocks and he's aware that he's not perfect that part of the reason is he fraked up a little, but he really does want to make things better you can say this situation was one hell of a way to do it. I also just like how he reacts to things which feel like how any ordinary person would react, really like how at times he talks to himself to help himself think, in those scenes the film is almost a one man show, one of my favorite quotes is 'Think God Damnit Think.' Yeah that what I always say whenever I have a certain dilemma I have to deal with.Also, you see in some places how tired and slightly irritated mannerism as you can tell half the time he's thinking 'I don't want to do this, I really don't.', he didn't ask nor want to put himself in the action hero position as all he really wanted to do was the simplest thing spending Christmas with his family. But he has no choice so he pretty much rolls his eyes and goes with the role as no one else can do it, let alone his life and many others depend on it.The action is well choregraphed, I like that it doesn't look too smooth which makes the film a bit realistic if you can believe that. You have some solid shootouts in the building like one that involves probably the biggest boardroom meeting table I've ever seen, which is kind of funny as it seems big enough to fit Congress. As well as a one on one fight which is one of my favorite one on ones of all time as both Karl and John are going at it, I liked the way it was done because it really felt realistic as it looked like real fighting. As a real fight wouldn't be perfectly choregraphed and there are no rules involved as both are fighting dirty.And of course, the effects are great like the explosion which are practical there's no CGI bullcrap which makes them look beautiful. My favorite is of course the explosion of the third floor, when I saw, word will fail to describe this as you have to see it for yourself but seeing it, I thought 'Wow, John you nuked the building.'Music is also great, there are plenty of memorable scores which create excitement and suspense. Even like the use of one famous Christmas song from Dean Martin in the end credits 'Let it Snow' every time I hear that song, I can't help but think of this film.What also makes this action film unique is the suspense from the physical situations of going from point A to B, surviving the firefights, and close calls in places that really put me on the edge of my seat.But also, double layered and clever in what is revealed to us and not revealed. Where on one hand you are sometimes in the robber's shoes as you actually do want them to open that vault, but seeing their perspective actually helps make us at times part of the action because we actually are one step ahead of the protagonist. And the suspense is hopping the protagonist will be able to catch up on time, get a step ahead but also help fill in a blank or two because despite knowing most of Han's plans there is one part of it, we still don't understand.Also, it's not just physical warfare but it's also a war of wits. Both John and Hans are both smart people, Han's heist plan and methodology is fool proof but the problem with him and the robbers is their thinking is inflexible and rigid because they never counted on an anomaly in the plan. John his intelligence might not be on the same level as Hans, as Hans stated he's had the finest education but good enough, because the thing about John is that his thinking is unorthodox, he is able to improvise and think on his feet literally.Die Hard will blow you away and Merry Christmas.Rating: 4 stars",10,1,1,15 December 2019
Love Actually," Love Everywhere
","Driver Stu from 'The Adventures of Pete and Pete' once said, 'When love comes, you better pull over to the side of the road and open your doors, cause nothing in this life matters more.' The strange and funny thing about love is how it can just happen when we least expect it to, when we feel very little to no control over our lives, when it seems at almost the most inconvenient time it just simply happens. Just like the seasons of nature it is an element vitally needed so not just can the world be nurtured to continue to grow and thrive but our own spirits.This film is one of my favorite romance films but also an honorable mention in favorite Christmas movies. The film is sort of an anthology by its nature as the stories are focused on multiple individuals whom all somewhat are in the same place and sometimes connect and intersect with each other, but the theme is the same which is about love.To me this is one of those romance films done right for one thing each of the stories like in any anthology are short which means there's no filler and sub plot nonsense which is what plagues a lot of bad rom coms and make them forget what movie they are.Most importantly though they each keep their eye on the ball, each of the stories knows who they are and what they want to say and be which is part of why the stories and characters in them to this day are endearing and timeless. Ok, not everyone of them one or two I can leave out but like with all anthologies it's all a matter of your preference.The cast consists of an all star cast which most of the time isn't always a good mix as it's been known when most films which consist of all-star casts don't always equal good movies. But fortunately, this film is one of those case where it does, personally I feel an all-star cast film can work where you use each of them right and well but also have a good story.Though believe or not, this film didn't consist of an all star cast as only half of them were major leaguers and most others we're either unknowns or minor league players, this film was sort of a launch point for them. It makes watching the film even more interesting seeing a face or two getting their start, and anyone that has seen it before at the time thinking who knew.I'll just say a few of the stories I really like as there are a lot of them.Jamie and Aurelia: Colin Firth is just great as Jamie, I like how in the film he sort of looks like Richard Castle, ok not really but from his haircut and the way he's dressed, even a little of his character is a bit similar to that character.
Here he's a guy a bit on the introverted side, he's a little down on his luck as he has writers block or on a losing streak as he's had one bad book after another.It's also funny how his a bit of a slob as his desk are always in disarray as we see papers are dis or unorganized but also a bit of a caffeine addict as he has a series of coffee mugs pileing up his desk, this sort of reflects his whole life and even love life is in total disarray.But of course, his luck is just about to change when Aurelia comes into his life. She is played by a lovely actress, Lucia Moniz whom hasn't really done any other movies outside of her region afterward. Anyway, I really like the chemistry between the two is just beautiful as both are from two different worlds.The relationship is somewhat ironic as his profession part of what it's about is communicating with everyone around you by putting your ideas out there. We see that Aurelia really is good for him from not just making his house more livable but helping him become more assertive, do what he must do.One interesting moment is when he visits his family which I'll admit was something that came completely out of the blue. This scene works well in two ways, I really liked that look on his face which is exactly what we're all thinking, and it says, 'Wait a minute what am I doing here.' He realizes he's not where he should be that his place is with Aurelia. But also, it was sort of the broken fourth wall joke as that look is someone that suddenly walked into the wrong Christmas movie, like a scene that was just inserted at the last minute which was the point and joke. What he does at the last minutes are beautiful, I won't say anything else about this except it show both truly are on the same page.Mark and Juliet: This is another which is a small one, which involves Juliet and Mark played well by one of my favorite actress Kira Knightly and Andrew Lincoln whom weren't stars at the time. This one is simply about unrequited love; we see in one scene where Mark inadvertently fudges up a wedding video for Juliet and her husband Peter played by Chiwetel Ejiofor before he was a star.We see Mark is a guy that has always harbored feelings for Juliet but never said anything as he was too afraid to. Which is understandable for some people it's really doesn't come easy and it's not so much fear of being shot down but being misunderstood. Or even simply the fact in life you let certain things get in your way which is an easy thing for all of us to do because hey life happens and dilemmas don't solve themselves; but also, simply not believing in oneself enough. It can also be a painful dilemma and cross to harbor as it leaves people wondering what could have happened if they did make a move.Though we know it might not have made much difference as Juliet doesn't feel the same way about him as she'll always see him as a friend which is also understandable too because that's also part of life as one doesn't always feel the same way or anything more about the other, it's just simply not in the cards.But the final minutes of the story result in a timeless scene which has been parodied a lot over the years. But this scene was obviously an homage to 'A Hard Day's Night' which of course is the cue card scene. It's just really sweet because he never says a word and he doesn't need to because in each of the cards he presents he is expressing his feelings for her but also shows how he's begun to become more assertive and find love of his own. This also goes with another quote from 'The Adventures of Pete and Pete' which is 'If love is true, really true it doesn't need an answer.'Prime Minister and Natalie: This one of course involves Hugh Grant whom at the time was somewhat the king of romance movies. Here he plays a prime minister of the UK, it's that simple story of the man that has everything except love. And there is his secretary Natalie played by Martine McCutcheon whom I think is cute and hot, it's too bad this actress didn't have a little more afterward as she's a capable one.The interplay between both Prime Minister and Natalie is just sweet as we see both are struggling to maintain a professional relationship, but we see that cracks are forming. Both already know what they feel for one another but have not just been unassertive about those feelings but have never felt or made time for them, as we see both are too busy maintaining and living a lifestyle but not a life, hence the fact Prime Minister's real name isn't known because he has no life outside of office. This makes both sympathetic as we see it's can be a very lonely and two-dimensional existence, sure you have success but as they say what good is it without happiness, to me that can be a waste of life too.I really like it when we see the Prime Minister finally being assertive or has been given the push to it when a high ranking political member sexually harasses Natalie and the Prime Minister in a speech defends her which shows he not just shows the strength of his integrity but also how strong his feelings for Natalie really are. When the payoff happens it's just sweet because it shows how the one you love is closer than you think but also putting your feelings out there for the other isn't as hard as it seems.Love can happen everywhere to anyone, throughout the holidays.Rating: 4 stars",10,2,3,13 December 2019
Die Hard with a Vengeance," Hot time to die in the city
","This is my second favorite in the series and another one of my favorite action films of all time.I really love the plotline, as usual with the Die Hard films it feels plausible, from the way it's handled whose to say no criminal organization had this in the back of their mind. It's true a bit of the scheme isn't too different but nothing wrong with that, what really matters is in its execution as an old saying goes if it's not broke don't fix it.Though it's also true that some parts are a little comic bookish but that's not a bad thing as it reminds us that despite the 'Die Hard' franchise being down to Earth it's still a movie. Though I'm a little surprised that this plotline wasn't used in the 'Batman' film franchise as this feels like the kind of scheme 'The Riddler' would do, maybe in the future they'll consider it. On a side note this plotline was going to be for another 'Lethal Weapon' sequel which might have been interesting but I'm glad all the same this was in the 'Die Hard' franchise.Really like the setting of the film from the fact that it's set in New York this time which makes sense as it's McClane's hometown and his career's there. Also, the fact this time the film takes place in the summer time and not Christmas, which I'm fine with didn't want things to feel too formulaic. Also, both New York and summer time is fitting for this film, despite summer being a time for vacation, rest and relaxation, it can also be the most stressful time of the year. From not just the heat but crime which spikes up even faster than the heat during that time most notably in the big cities which of course makes New York the perfect arena.Music is good, like the use of the sone 'When Johnny Comes Marching Home' which ironically fit in both ways, but mainly the song 'Summer in the City' as the theme song for the film which fits like a glove for this film. I'll admit ever time I hear that oldie but goodie, I always think about this film.Characters are great there is a colorful cast, from the main villain Simon Grubber played by one of my favorite actors Jeremy Irons and this is one of my favorite roles from him. He's another villain on my honorable mention of favorite fictional villains but my second favorite main villain in the 'Die Hard' franchise.I really bought him as Hans Grubber's brother Simon whom just like Hans has the same aims as him but also there are slight differences that set him apart. Like the fact he's not a ruthless as Hans however just like his brother he's just as much a skilled chess player as he's a step or two ahead and doesn't let everyone on all his scheme. He's not as ruthless as Hans but he's not afraid to take anyone out that gets in the way and tries to ruin his plans.Really like his German accent which sounds sharp, well mannered and sinister. The guy runs his scheme in a sort of military fashion as he has a well-coordinated operation and well thought out plan he is executing at the right places at the right times. But what I really like about him is that he's sort of a cat that likes to play with his food, as he is constantly giving John several challenges to the point where if the challenges don't kill John he will.Zeus played well by one of my favorite actors Samuel L Jackson. This film was one of the films that helped put him on the map and it was a good choice. I really love his character as it's pretty much Sam sort of being Sam.His character and John have one thing in common as he's a reluctant hero that really didn't ask to do any hero work but he sigh's, grits his teeth a little and does it anyway as no one else can or will which is understandable as stopping bombs isn't on my to do list either or any other sane person's list. Another common thing is both have charisma, but Zeus's charisma is different as his is more of a tough aggressive attitude, where he doesn't take crap from anyone, one scene I like is when he shoos a suit jerk away from the phone when that guy makes a small offensive comment; yeah serves that jerk right.Though we see Zeus has a slight Achilles heel as he has prejudicial slightly antisocial attitudes, though this doesn't deter from his humanity as he doesn't wear these attitudes like a badge which is why we can forgive him for it as we understand where he's coming from, much like with Archie Bunker in 'All in the Family' but that's a different story. And this whole debacle you can say was one hell of a way for Zeus to learn to get along as prejudice would be the killer.And of course, John McClane played well by Bruce Willis. As usual John is himself as he is the usual reluctant hero that really doesn't want to do this but must as he's forced once more to play the game.However, we see John is in a bad place in his life right now as you see from the beginning he looks and feels like crap. From getting suspended for who knows what we never really know but whatever it was it wasn't good. His marriage is on the rocks again though this time it's bad. And he of course throughout a bit of the film he's had a bit of a bad hangover, as he's had more than he can handle yesterday. And of course not any closer to winning the Lotery.Which in a way makes some of John's plight sort of his slight journey to redemption and the terrorist attack seems to be one hell of a start on that road and let alone with his current personal situation, what the hell else is he going to do.The film by its nature is sort of a buddy cop movie as we see both John and Zeus are on the fence with each other. The back and forth between both is just great. Both we see really clash with one another and don't get along too well. Yet both do work well together and as the film goes further alone, we see both slowly but surely get along as those clashing attitudes start to cool down along with Pete's plans as they both get closer.The humor is great, it hits in the right places and times and is memorable. There are just so many fun moments between both McClaine and Zeus. Like seeing both in a cab going though the park and then in a dialog scene Zeus says, 'Are you aiming for these people' and McClaine says, 'No, well maybe that mime.' That always makes me snicker. Or even seeing both McClaine and Zeus jack bikes from juvenile shoplifters, all I can say to those shoplifters is serves them right.The action is great the film plays out like a live action video game as we see both McClaine and Zeus just constantly on the move, having to get from point A, B, C and so on. And we they are doing it any way they can and have a whole city to work with which sort of reminds me of the 'Grand Theft Auto' video games well sort of and this film was years before those games.The suspense really excels from both the physical challenges that McClane and Zeus must get through but also there thought provoking at the same time with he riddles that Peter serves both of them. Though if your good with riddles you might easily be able to solve them before the protagonists do as we know the solution to riddles is simple, they just don't seem that way as first.There is as usual that double layered suspense as we see Peter and his villain army are conducting their theft operation. We are a step ahead of McClaine and Zeus and are hoping both will not just play though Peter's game and survive but also along the way catch on to Pete's true plan and get a step ahead of him. And we also need both McClaine and Zeus to help us fill in the blanks on some other parts of Pete's plan he hasn't let us in on.The only dud the film has for me is McClaine I don't feel gets to kick a lot of ass in this film. Ok, yeah, he does but I mean there aren't really that many physical confrontations. Would have liked to of seen at least one or two intense shootouts or even another kind of chase where McClane he must chase down some of the dump trucks with the gold trying to escape and their shooting at him and he shoots back.But this is just a very tiny dud, as McClaine in the film does have some physical confrontations where he gets to kick some ass, so some is better than none. And due to the films pacing and seeing both McClaine and Zeus constantly on the move doing things I hardly noticed so I really can't complain much.This entry to the series is a hot actioner with a vengeance.Rating: 4 stars",10,1,1,19 December 2019
WALL·E," Machines with a heart and soul
","I've seen a lot of Pixar/Disney films and sci-fi in my time, and I'm proud to say that this is once again another great achievement on both counts and is another one of my favorite movies in general.The CGI animation work is just at it's best from he background details to some of the robots themselves, they all looked believably real that it's easy to forget that your even watching an animated movie.However the real power was in it's context and character we read it all mainly by what we see in the visuals since this film really doesn't have much dialog, so in a way it's almost like a silent movie but thats a great thing because form how it's handled we understand perfectly.The setting for the whole film is very dark it feels like it could happen, it's sort of a mix in tomorrows world/post apocalyptic sci-fi both in a negative satirical light though a playful sensibility at the same time. From the first half we see the earth all ruined and polluted and practically lifeless except for WALL-E and is friend a jumping cockroach. We see sky scrapers crumpled down a little, monorail trains broken down, junk and scrap left and right, atmospheric imbalance no thanks to global warming just a lot of bad left and right.To the other half of the film where of course we see all of the humans in some sort of Titanic like space craft, living there until Earth becomes habitable again; technology is most of the time running the show doing just about every little thing for them to make their lives easier. But that's the biggest problem with that ship their lives are too easy. All of the humans have simply became fat and lazy; they're all on hover chairs that do even the littlest things for them and they don't even have to movie much except press a button to give them what they want. None even eat solid food any more cause their too lazy to cook, the only way they do that is by simply drinking some sort of 711 Proteian Slurpee drink, yuck. They play sports but they don't participate in it because robots do that work for them; video game have more participation then that. But the worst part for me was seeing their mannerism where they have became somewhat docile and disconnected, yest they talk to one another but on a computer screen never directly face to face.Film does have some important underling messages from eco ethics on why we need to take better care of our enviorment. But most of all an anti consumerism and anti obesity, simply we need to take better care of ourselves we shouldn't make life too easy or we stop becoming human.However the film is a simply sweet love story/adventure. The two character WALL-E and Eve are great, I actually found myself care for them. WALL-E is sort of this mini garbage truck robot that compresses junk into cubes and stacks them like a Jenga puzzle every day to form sky scrapers. He's just such a cute and charming character from the way his body is shaped which makes him look like E.T. The way he interacts with things which has a naive childlike sensibility like with a ping pong or fire extinguisher, sounds he makes and just simple gestures which make him seem a little unsmooth but most importantly human.Same with Eve whom is a beautiful sleek advanced egg shaped robot whose mission is to explore the earth for habitability and report it, but what truly makes her great is she has a mature personality about her.The love story with the two is sweet both are sort of a strange Adam and Eve like couple since they have the earth to themselves hence the name of the robot for irony. It's actually believable because both these robots actually feel human, you can actually feel the emotion not so much from the words, both don't say much except one word their name most of the time or make certain noises which give the suggestion of certain interaction and emotion through their actions and body language. It reminds me of the Charlie Chaplin from 'City Lights' which relied on actions but most of all was about an unlikely but beautiful pair.Fromt he first interaction which is a little unsmooth, WALL-E we see is slowly trying to get a bit close to Eve to talk but it doesn't go right at first because else is focused on business right now or just things he's a bit of a dork. But of course she does eventually let him talk to her when she feels frustration and loneliness. And of course he does win her robot heart from his funny but warm personality and charm. From showing her all the great things the world has to offer like a Rubik cube she solves in one minute, and of course the musical 'Hello Dolly' not my favorite musical though I like a song or two from their soundtrack. My favorite moment I found romantic was when both of them fly together in space. They both kiss in a way by simply touch their heads together exchanging a small static electricity bolt. All this was just romance at it's best because it's done perfectly, even though it's between two robots it was their feelings that made their love feel very human.We saw into WALL-E and Eve's heart and soul but WALL-E and Eve saw into our own.Rating: 4 stars",10,0,1,1 November 2012
The Conjuring," Conjuring Evil
","Haunted House stories most of the time play on our fear of what is unfamiliar or unknown, whether it's a new enviorment or just a mere noise that might be more than it sounds. For a while I felt the paranormal/ghost subgenere in horror was starting to run low on steam, but this film proved that there is still plenty of steam left and suppringly turned out to be one of my favorites in the horror subgenere.This of course is loosely based on one of the cases of real life paranormal investigators Ed and Loraine Warren. Which is cool since I'm into unexplained phenomena show's like 'Unsolved Mysteries' and 'A Haunting'. Whether you really believe any of it really happened or not I leave up to you.What I really like about this film is in it's execution; it goes an old school route because most to all of the film uses practical effects. I really like the production value from the house but down to the cars, wardrobe, and anything else to help recreate the early seventies making the film a bit of a period peace. The music score is solid, it really creates an unsettling moodiness, a feeling of dread. Though what gets me is really the moments when it's just absolute quiet, I just know in those moments something will happen.I really like the effects and the cinematography. Most of the effects are simple ones like doors opening or even certain sound cues, nothing too special but effective all the same, seeing a door swing open or close knowing I'm not the one that did it always creeps me out. You do see the ghosts but not much which I'm fine with, the make up effects are solid their creepy as usual. Cinematography is great, the one that impressed me the most was when it sometimes goes to a point of view shot of either of the characters, which I think is great because it gives you that feeling that your the other character in the film.There are a lot of memorable moments that generated a lot of jump scares and a certain amount of excitement. One which to me is probably one of the scariest scenes in horror I've ever seen was when the mom was trapped in the cellar and it was just pitch black you couldn't see crap, except for the matches she had which are of little help; I'll admit just the mere thought of this just gives me the creeps. But of course after things a quiet for a moment we hear a voice knowing there's a presence close but not an exact location, until we see some hands from behind her clap. I remember actually jumping along with most of the other audience in that moment, even heard a few screams in the theater; it was a great experience that I don't get often.But the cast/characters were also really good and actually well rounded. Patrick Wilson (Watchmen) and Vera Farmiga(TV's Bate's Motel) were solid as Ed and Loraine Warren. They had a little charisma and most of all a good back and forth. Even the family was just as good. Ron Livingston (Office Space) as the concerned dad Roger and Lili Taylor (TV's Almost Human) as the afflicted mom Carolyn. Along with the kids whom have moments themselves; couple of them I recognize, Joey King from 'Oz the Great a Powerful' and Mackenzie Foy from the 'Twilight' series (for the record have a niece that's a fan of it not me.) What's interesting is the fact you actually care even feel a sense of pathos for them, which is something I don't do enough in the horror genre; but also made me want the good guys all the more to win.You could also say the film is almost a Christian film since it has not just Christan intervention, but the theme on family. Wanting to be with your family and doing anything for them even protect them.Overall if your a fan of the paranormal subgenere 'The Conjuring' is worth conjuring up. What you don't see truly is the most scary.Rating: 4 stars",10,3,5,12 February 2014
Halloween," Season of Terror
","Halloween is one of my favorite season's of the year, best thing for is to go to parties. And this film is another one of the reason's I love the holiday, this is one of my favorite horror films as well as one of the first horror movies and films from my favorite movie director John Carpenter.I love this film for many reason, from the fact that it was made on a low budget which made it all the more great because this film really didn't need a big budget, it a funny how most films with a high budget sometimes disappoint me while ones on modest or low impress me. I think it's because of it's strong content and that the whole cast and crew really put lots of energy and effort into what they do to simply aim to make a good movie even if it doesn't turn out great though most of the time it really does whether they know it or not.I love the camera work where at time were in Michael's perspective, also just love the use of shadow and lighting really making the neighborhood seem foreboding. The darkness really give plenty of opportunities for danger, we see Michael appear and disappear in places and he doesn't cheat doing this Mike just knows the right places to go as if he has some GPS. One of the spookiest moments was when we saw Michael following the kid Tommy Doyle in front of the elementary school he goes to, it really made me wonder how secure our own public schools are. After this film I checked the back yard, since we have a medium sized back yard. But also on how Michael always seems to take his time, it's like you can never get far enough away from him, it's true he walks but if you even get cornered then your fraked.But also just does suspense really well the fact that we are at times in Mike's perspective is the classic element of being a step ahead of the protagonist, the suspense is in hoping the hero will figure out what we know sooner. It even has a participatory sense where there were time I could help but almost yell out 'C'mon walk it off and get moving.' or even 'C'mon open the damn door, hustle; this is not something that I do in most horror movies which is why it's such a great feeling.I love the sense of relatablity, that neighborhood looks like my own neighborhood, certain features to it like the Myers house which is creepy where in most neighborhoods they have those houses which just breeds stories that may or may not be true of the house being either haunted or a bad incident occurred. But most of all the main protagonist Larrie Strode which was of course Jamie Lee Curtis's debut role. Larrie is actually a lot like myself when I was her age. She is shy, insecure, a bit of a geek ( I mean that in a good way), always want to be in control, and isn't looking for trouble but as a saying goes trouble may'be looking for her. I really love how her character can hold her own against danger, which goes to show even though she's scared she's not a wimp she can defend herself.Supporting character Dr. Sam Lomis played by the late great Donald Plesance is also great, he's sort of the classic vampire hunter archetype. His character knows the nature of the man he hunts and we are on his side and want him to succeed because we do as well. My favorite moment with him no doubt is his monologue on the story of Michael, which really sends chills because his story fuels our imagination.Michael Myers is one of the best horror movie figures and villains to grace films. There is just a lot that is scary about him from the breathing much like with Darth Vader. That mask of his I'll admit looking at it still give me chills, it is just so pale white, inhuman, expressionless, it perfectly reflected his evil nature. As well as how he behaves which is creepy, he's like a game hunter we don't see him do anything at first but we know he will and soon. But to me what make Michael really scary is the sense of enigma he carries. We don't know what his motive for his crimes are there is none, same with his first crime when he was six it just simply came out of nowhere. Personally I don't think he's human, as you can see the look he had when he was six he clearly didn't kill by his own will, my theory is that Michael is possessed by a demon. I don't know your theory is as good as mine but still from that site where the grave of Judith Myers was stolen the hole looks clean as if the grave was pulled up not pulled out, as well as other things you can't help but wonder.And of course who can forget the score, it is one of the best damn score in both the horror genre and just movies in general. Without it the film wouldn't of worked, it really helped create a creepy and foreboding atmosphere you constantly feel dread and impending danger, there is even music as the action is conducted I really loved it in that chase scene which is one of my favorite chases ever. As well as the theme song which is one of my favorite themes ever and hopefully our current films and TV show will take the time to make an actually theme to their works.So, Happy Halloween but beware there may'be something in the night.Rating: 4 stars",Null,1,3,14 November 2011
Back to the Future Part II," Multiple Possibilities
","Like a good cliffhanger serial, the second story follows up smoothly with the first and broadens more of the world in the story.This film was one (or one of) the first ones that actually played with the concept of alternate possibilities as well as clever storytelling style by having it constantly moving to loop around back to the beginning. It's sort of the dictum sometimes when you go backward you go forward (or something like that. The special effects and sets are all top notch because their all practical, you can see they put a heck of a lot of effort into making it, as well as the painful process of construction and reconstruction, but all that pays off. It's cheerful and comical as usual however there is a dark overtone which makes the film take a bit of an unfun turn, but to me that just what makes the film more interesting and make me want the good guys to win because what happens in the film matters.The first act is a lot of fun where we see the future which looks straight out of pulp sci-fi, only it's a reality. It's a bright fun colorful cheerful future some aspects of it slightly prolific on what we have today. There are 80's cafes, hover boards, hollow graphic theaters, electric hover cars, attire that looks a little like 80's fashion only even more colorful, and other things. My favorite thing has always been the power laces, those things are awesome because I wouldn't have to stop and tie my shoes all the time, honestly who wants to and think of the amount of time it takes to do it. My favorite sequence of course is the hover board chase. But there is also a flip side of the coin to this, at the same time it's a slightly dark future because it also shows an America that has completely sold out to consumerism, big products, media, and technology. But the real darkness is when we see the grown up version of Marty, we see how one bad choice has not just made him look older than he really is but has taken away his dignity, musical ability, and reduced him to a brown noser.We then get to the second act when we see the alternate Hill Valley which is a very dark version of their present once Biff manipulates the past with information from the future for his own personal gain, and it's practically looks like Hell on Earth. It's a cesspool of crime and corruption, and there is one moment of dark discovery that made my heart sink. That moment along with seeing the older version of Marty showed how important choices we make in the present really are and they are never without consequences for the future.And of course the final act where we see them back in the same past as the original film. This was an interesting move which I don't see often let alone done well, what made it interesting was that we were seeing the movie in a different perspective this time which has been hidden away from us, sort of non linear story telling style like in 'Pulp Fiction' or the TV show 'Lost'.If the film has a message is that the future truly is in our hands, it can be one way or another. But every decision we make must be made wisely because it will affect who we will become in the future as well as what kind we make for ourselves.Rating: 4 stars",10,1,2,26 July 2012
The Dark Knight Rises," Batman's Final Flight
","As a saying goes all good things must come to an end, most third or even final entries to a franchise most of the time disappoint me, to me a proper finale shouldn't just have the biggest final fight but the character/characters have to be at their best. This film has both those things and to me makes this franchise one of the best trilogies up there with the 'Star Wars Trilogy' (episodes 4-6 to be exact) and 'Lord of the Rings' I personally can't think of a better way to end it, and this will sound controversial but this film is my favorite in the series.As usual everything works, production value is on par, music score is great. The action sequences were great, I really loved seeing Batman use the Batwing, though personally my favorite vehicle will always be the Bat Pod. But my favorite one was in the two one on one fights against Bane which were intense but also rather suspenseful.But most of all the characters and their dynamics. The new villain Bane (played brilliantly by Tom Hardy) doesn't disappoint. This guy is physically and verbally intimidating and scary, from what he does and one look at him I couldn't help but be a little worried for Bruce/Batman's life. I like the voice reminds me of Lord Humungus from 'The Road Warrior' but some of the things he says could really put a chill down your spine. But anyway Bane is sort of a modern day Atila the Hun, a ruthless, merciless, borderline insane conquerer hellbent on completing the objective from the League of Shadows which is to annihilate Gotham and destroy Batman's physically and spiritually. His plans and action feel frighteningly plausible if any organization or leader of it is smart and crazy enough. Indeed things do get out of control as we see Bane along with his league and scum of Gotham take over the city, kinda like in the movie 'Escape from New York' where the imprisoned criminals have created a world of their own.But to me the real people that drove the film are Bruce/Batman and Selena/Catwoman. As usual my favorite actor Christian Bale plays Bruce/Batman well. Here we see that the business of being has taken it's toll on him physically and may'be even mentally. The main problem with him is that he hasn't really moved on because he doesn't have anyone to move on with so he feels he has no future.Anne Halfaway is just awesome as Selena/Catwoman. Not just does she look great in the cat suit and mask (and without them) but has the persona to boot. I love how she's feisty, fiery, has charisma, an unpredictability about her, but she is a bit sympathetic because you can tell she wants something more out of life and she has a conscious. Love her martial arts moves, their sort of gymnastic like. She has a low opinion on men, she isn't sexist she's just had bad experiences with them, don't blame her most have been scum or windbags. As well a prejudice to the higher class because she feels they waste there money on themselves instead of helping others.The chemistry between both of them I think is great, there really are sparks flying between the two. Both of them truly are the same, split right down to the center. Despite her prejudice toward Bruce's social status she does fancys him, from their interaction time she easily forgets he's rich in fact doesn't even care, likewise for Bruce and on further not he's not really rich anymore he actually becomes broke so you can say both are on equal ground. But both also have dual identities and almost similar abilities, like one moment when she disappear from Batman when he looks away for a moment. To me I feel that part of what love is that it shouldn't matter, whether it be race, religion, social status, or any other feature, it's what two people feel for one another that matters.If their are themes it's simply about moving on and being yourself and why there has to still be heroes in the world. Bruce we see is learning the hard way that being a superhero isn't just a responsibility but that it's a business and like all businesses it loves no one back it can go on even without him; he's getting older and has physically taken his toll. But he also realizes how his personal life has became empty and he doesn't want to live that way anymore he can't. In a way I feel that's another part of what it means to be a superhero, to learn to be yourself because that really is what the world needs the most just you.The Dark Knight Rises toward the light of day.Rating: 4 stars",10,3,8,29 July 2012
Blade Runner," Soul Searching
","This film is my favorite film of all time (and for the record on my birth year), based on one of my favorite books of all time by one of my favorite author's Philip K Dick. The film also had a universal appeal as it has inspired lots of TV shows (Ghost in the Shell, Batman Beyond, Exo Squad, Phantom 2040, Battlestar Galatica, etc.) and other things. But also changed the way we saw sci-fi, showing how much more it can be.The production value is just fantastic because it's all practically. The city landscape is just awe inspiring along with the cinematography of it. From the very beginning with the music, once we saw that city I knew we've been transported to the future and I just didn't want to leave as there is just so much to see and take in. From the hover cars (still wonder about the traffic laws in air traffic), the big flat screen displays, the scanner screen in which you can speak out coordinates for the screen to zoom in. I really like the use of the lighting, from the amount of grit and darkness making the world not just feel accessible but also giving the film the noir feel. The futuristic city feels plausible and I personally feel with some of the technology we have now we're starting to get very close.Music score is just beautiful, I love how it's orchastratic but also a bit of techno beat which sort of fits the film and the world that it's in.But I just really love the story it is so rich with content that it would literally take more than one watch just to uncover more. It's not so much just a simple detective story but really just like most to all of Philp K Dick's works are really sort of an extensential philosophical meditation on the subjects like life and death as well as what is human? The characters are great, it's true not the deepest characters but sometimes characters we don't know too much about I find more interesting than ones we know everything about. And also what's really interesting is the fact that there are really any good guys and bad guys their all kinda in a gray area which was for it's time sort of rare.Richard Decard this is believe it or not my second favorite role from one of my favorite actors Harrison Ford, because the character he plays isn't really a hero but most of all human. He's a guy that is sort of broken and haunted by his career that he at first didn't choose to question until now, and just like the rain the guilt is weighing down on him and not stopping.In a way most of this film is really about Richard regaining his own sense of humanity. This guy was literally from my observations an all business type, it can be a really sad lifestyle because it's a rather two dimensional existence; it's simply a lifestyle but not really a life. We kind of see it from his apartment which doesn't really have much to anything, just some random stuff but no real sense of an identity.It's until Richard starts to have a relationship with the replicant Rachel, we see him become more balanced. I really like how it's handled, it feels realistic from the way they interact as we see both of them are trying to get a read on one another and warm up. I even like the Rachel has that look and mannerism like most women in the noir genre whom can be helpful but also carry a sense of mystery attached to them.Roy Batty is played well by another favorite actor of mine Ruger Hauwer whom is an antagonist (well sort of) that you actually sort of feel a sense of pathos for even sort of side with (I said sort of). Roy isn't a Replicant that wants to do take revenge on all mankind cliché. This is a guy that is trying to put more time in his biological clock.Some of the things he says are great, I really like it when he states and questions with slight frustration and fear why they weren't built to last. That's the kind of questions that we ask, whether were of a faith or not; and to this day still have no answer.There is an interesting dichotomous relationship between both the humans and the replicates. As we see most of the human have allowed themselves to be less human and the replicates are becoming a bit more human. However we also see the parallels between both human and Replicants, just as the Replicants are looking for more time to live but are also constantly fascinated in their experience with our culture is just like our own common struggle to live life to the fullest and also somehow give ourselves a few more years to live, so we can experience more.But also we find ourselves questioning things, I really like how there is this revolving notion on Richard Decard possibly being a Replicant and there are some suttle hints. Like one interesting moment was when we saw the eye lights on Richard for two seconds it's easy to miss. The thing is each of the Replicants all have one signature where their eye pupils have light. It sort of makes sense as to why he's so good at tracking Replicants down. I don't know whether Richard is a Replicant or not, I leave that for your own judgment but then again does it really matter.Decakard is searching for his human soul, just as we are searching for our own.Rating: 4 stars",10,1,4,2 March 2016
Speed," Maximum Overdrive
","We are dependent everyday on motorized transportation whether it's by car, plane, motorcycle, anything else to get us from point A to B in the least amount of time. However despite these things in working order like with all machines there is that looming possibility that something can go wrong and usually does.This is one of my favorite action films of all time, it's just so thrilling and so much fun. This film has a lot to offer at the quickest amount of time it runs on. The cinematography and effects are great because it's all practical and real. You really do feeling like you moving at high speed. The music score is exciting the theme song is one of my favorite themes of all time, and this score may have been a partial inspiration for the score in the video game franchise 'Metal Gear Solid'.The characters are really good: Howard Payne by the late great Dennis Hopper is a good opponent, he's a villain you love to hate. His character is a smart greedy psychopath who is menacing, a short fuse when things don't go his way, and he's got some charisma so he's got some really good lines.Protagonists are also good from the main one Jack Traven played well by Keanu Reeves, he's tough, knows how to keep his cool and be in control of an out of control situation, smart, and also has charisma he has some good lines as well as humorous moments like unintentionally giving a guy I call the Tuneman some grief.Annie Porter played by one of my favorite actresses Sandra Bullock whom I think is hot and has the persona to boot. She feisty, funny, witty, has some fire in her, she can also handle herself under pressure, has driving skills which are obviously useful, she should of been a race car driver.Even a few of the passengers and two people that help them Harry Temple (Jeff Danniels) and Capt. McMahon (Joe Morton from the TV show 'Eureka') are also really good, contribute and have their moments and good lines. This is part of what makes the suspense of the film work is actually caring about the protagonists and hoping they'll get out alive.The plot I really like it's simple but feels plausible, whose to say no bomber had this in the back of their minds. And the best thing about the film is in it's suspense and pacing. I love the way it's structured it's sort of like a video game you just can't afford to take a breath, where in this film you have three different situations which are the Elevator, Bus, and Train, much like how each level of a game is always a different challenge; and all require for everyone to constantly move if they stay still for even a mere moment then it's game over forever.Also as the action is going along there are constant obstacles whether it's something in the way or even time itself, I like how the protagonists have to think throughly fast on how to get though this or survive that. It's true certain solutions are implausible like the one for the infamous 50 foot gap but it's a movie like with the TV show 'Macgyver' it's fun to think some of those things could work. All this just kept me on the edge of my seat, just constantly worrying what else will happen, how worse can things get, and how are they going to survive this or that. Those are questions like the bus just constantly race though you mind the whole time which is another reason why the suspense works. Well thats as far as I go, Speed has enough millage for action.Rating: 4 stars",10,3,5,31 December 2012
A Nightmare on Elm Street," Dream Demon
","This is one of my favorite films of all time and it's my favorite film from one of my favorite horror directors the late great Wes Craven. This film wasn't just another horror movie, but it was a phenomenon and another one of the longest running franchises in horror, and most importantly established another iconic character in the genre.There is so much to love about the film, the effects are great, not just from the gore effects, ok the film's not that gory which is probably a good think but there are some good blood effects all the same, and has some creative kills and not just mere slashing. My favorite and scary one to me was of course the infamous bed death, I'll admit seeing that the first time I really didn't want to go to sleep on my bed for a long while. But I really love how the dream sequences are handled, I really love how it messes with your senses, at first your able to tell from the reality realm and the dream realm but soon when we get further in the film the line begins to blur and you question if the protagonists are still dreaming or in reality.I really like the story line which is great as it's of course inspired and based on a medical phenomenon on people dying in their dreams. This I think was a very creative idea for the Slasher genre in using the realm of dreams as an arena of terror. In the normal slasher film, you usually can run and hide from the monster/killer. In this film the slasher is attacking us in the most vulnerable place of our human psyche; this is scary because here we can't see the monster in the realm of reality let alone the know scientific fact that sooner or later, we all must go to sleep. In the realm of dreams, you have limited control because when we dream, we sometimes are unable to tell from reality and fantasy as both seem to blur, let alone command our bodies at will to awaken when we want to, as when we sleep our bodies run on their own biological alarm clock.Fready Kruger is one of my favorite fictional villains of all time, played brilliantly by one of my favorite horror actor's Robert England. Really like the look of him which is sort of a burnt facial look, the strange red and black striped sweater, that hat that sort of make him look like an evil supernatural bandit which he is. This guy was just scary on all different facets, heck scared me even when I wasn't old enough to watch the films from the posters and the numerous ads on him. This film is more the dark Fready as he is menacing from that voice and some of those memorable lines, he's kind of funny but since he's dark Fready he has very little humor. He of course has his trademark weapon that razored glove, which is such a deadly and nasty weapon, just one look at it hurt me thinking about the amount of bodily damage it can do.However, to me it wasn't so much that razor fingered glove I feared but the fact he has the power to manipulate and bend the world of dreams with his mind. That can be scary because it shakes your perception on reality and fantasy, which makes you have zero control of the circumstances your in. So, if you ever get trapped in the dream realm with him your as good as fraked.Other than Fready what also really makes the film is the lead protagonist herself whom to me is one of my favorite horror protagonists of all time. Heather Langencamp whom is an actress I like that is underrated. Personally, I mainly knew about her from watching the 80's sitcom 'Just the Ten of Us' really liked her character in that show and seeing her in this film was a bit surreal at the time because I saw that sitcom as a kid, this film I never saw until I was an adolescent. But anyway, I really like her, had a bit of a crush on her as she is just sexy and kind of hot with persona to boot.Nancy is likeable and sympathetic as she like any other typical teenager that likes to be sociable with her friends and boyfriend whom are also likeable characters in their own way which makes what happens to them heart sinking, but also a prime motivator for Nancy to win. Of course, you know Nancy's boyfriend is played by Johnny Depp and this was his debut, which I'll say is one hell of a start but a lot of actors have had their start in horror films. However, he's solid as Nancy's significant other, I like that he does what any good boyfriend should do which is to support their girlfriend no matter what; let alone actually believe her because from certain things happening he know certain things the rational world dictates don't add up.One of the things I like about her is how highly intelligent she is, she's kind of a tactician really love that sequence near the end where she is reading this book on Booby Traps (I'd love to buy that book) and is setting up traps for a very clever plan that could make Doctor Who jealous. Seeing this sequence makes me wonder if this film might have been a partial inspiration for the final conformation sequence in 'Home Alone'.But other than your cat and mouse thriller, this film does have deep substance, as it's somewhat of a coming of age tale. Which makes sense as teenagers are people that are on the verge of adulthood and all are taking steps toward it, despite not knowing the dangers that world can contain. Nancy very much is the adult in the film as we see her not just learning to defend and fight against Fready but also taking charge of her own life in the process.We see that most of the adults that she placed her trust in can't be trusted as most seem to have the pathetic mentality of knowing what's best for the other, we see them do some stupid things to put Nancy and company in more danger. From Nancy mom baring the house or even Glen's dad putting the phone off the hook despite the fact Nancy's calling to save his son's life, yeah real smart guys you ought to move to 'South Park' you'll fit right in. But things like that give the film a bit of an isolated feeling, but also shows what part of being an adult is about which is you can count on no one but yourself, as Han Solo once put it 'I take orders from one person, me!' that exactly the person Nancy is taking orders from and who we all should take orders from ourselves.But also, another message about facing your fears, Fready may seem powerful but the power he is displaying toward each of his intended victims are illusions, he feeds of their fear and is really using that to kill them, because they believe in it so much it becomes real. It's only when we take control and start to realize the truth, that the fear we're being subjected to doesn't really exist, once we do that it has no power over us.Even if you escape death, it's never far from your dreams.Rating: 4 stars",10,1,1,19 December 2018
Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure," Time Traveling without a Clue
","I always love time travel stories because there are just so many things you can do let alone ways to have fun with. It's true that the only weakness these stories have is in the inconsistencies but personally I never cared and nor does this movie because it's doesn't care about being logical but simply having a wild ride.This film is one of my personal favorite comedies, I've seen this when I was a child and I still love it now. I was drawn in because this film had two of the many things I love in life, Rock n, Roll and Time Travel, both mixed together and made a tasty combo. On one hand you could say the film has a lesson on how people are always capable of becoming something great and making history. But on the other hand this film is just plain stupid fun but done right. The effects and production value is good and so is the music.I love their time machine, yeah I know a phone booth seems kinda stupid (let alone dated) but trust me the way it works will make you a believer. It cool because it's a non cliché time travel device which is something I rarely see only other time travel that uses a phone booth is 'Doctor Who'. The film sort of have a bit of that wish fulfillment quality, just simply wanting to meet and take with you any historical figure you want, for them to be your friends and have a good time with you; one I'd love to bring would be Bruce Lee. The historical figures don't disappoint there all really just exaggerations of the persona's which make them funny, my favorite is Gengus Khan he's sort of reminds of cartoon characters 'Tazmanian Devil' or 'Captain Caveman' since both characters don't really talk much or at all and justly simply let loose when they feel like it.There is also this concept which is both fascinating and ridiculous at the same time, this of course is the infamous Time Game where if you say you'll go back in time and get or do this then it will appear or become possible in the present, it's pretty much the concept of being one step ahead. If I say I want to go back in time and I bring Keira Knightly to come at a certain spot and a certain time to help me out of a jam, then that would happen. Yeah, I know ridiculous but that the point which makes it all the more hilarious.But of course what really drives the film are Bill and Ted themselves (played excellently by Alex Winter and Keanu Reeves) I love the buddy buddy chemistry between them there's good back and forth. Both are practically one character since both have the same persona, they're both actually smart if not geniuses (then again how many really can be), talk in sort of surfer tone. But what makes them all the more fun is that their naivety, both are fans of heavy metal and rock n' roll but most of all how both of them have an ambition of being a great rock band and are trying to make it a reality. That I can emphasize with because the thought of being a rock star one time crossed my mind when I was a child and I'm a fan of rock n' roll and heavy metal music. Both just have dialog that is fraking hilarious, the things they say are deliciously fun and bad that you'll both groan and laugh at the same time. And most importantly it's just plain fun seeing two unlikely and slightly clueless travelers just have fun with both the historical figures and the decades they come from, likewise for the figures that come to our present. One favorite scene of mine is when both are in knight armor and are playing 'Star Wars', just like that movie itself those reference jokes never get old.So just turn your brains of and dial in for an excellent ride.Rating: 4 stars",10,0,0,26 October 2012
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," Galactic Fairy Tale
","This is one of my favorite films of all time, sci-fi films and it's my third favorite in the series. It's also the second sci-fi film I've ever seen that got me into the genre. I got into this film franchise when I was about eight, I was a real fan of the cartoon show 'He Man and the Masters of the Universe' and I was looking for some movies that were similar to that series and my mom presented this film as she of course saw the film before I was born. Once I and my mom saw this film together, that film changed my life forever.'Star Wars' isn't just a timeless classic but it's a phenomenon that is still going on to this day. From the expanded universe series (Legends and the recent one to be exact) that we see from the comic books/graphic novels, books, fanfiction (if you want to count it). TV shows like 'The Clone Wars', 'Rebels', and 'The Mandalorian'. Video Games like 'Knights of the Republic 1 and 2' and 'Jedi Fallen Order'. The movies afterward like, the presequel trilogy (which I actually like despite not perfect) and recent trilogy episodes 7 though 9 (which I'm not a fan of, though movies 7 and 9 are watchable, 8 doesn't exist in this Jedi temple.). The mythology and legacy this film has created lives on.There is just so much I love about this movie; you could easily make several long essay or do a long discussion panel about why but I'll just state some of the reasons.The music in the film is awesome by one of my favorite composers John Williams. This film and the rest afterward have the best series of scores I've ever heard in any movie, there is not one track that isn't memorable, I can tell effort and love were put into each piece. From that theme song which is one of my favorite theme songs of all time; just hearing the very first notes of that score almost blasted me off of my seat literally as they just came as a surprise after the first sentence we see at the beginning. That moment along with the rest of the sequence went to show you instantly blasted off into adventure.I also really love how philosophical it is, this film was sort of my first introductory into Phylosophy, at the time I watched. I never even know about Philosophy or was ever aware of Joseph Campbell at the time until I took a collage course at PLU. So, in a way the film really taught me about the concept of heroism and the philosophy behind it.Luke is one of my favorite protagonists, he and the film itself fall into Campbells path of the hero which isn't uncommon but it's the execution that makes it stand out. Luke I and we (or some) can relate or emphasize with him as he's pretty much an ordinary guy who is living a pretty ordinary existence but desires to go out and see what's out there. From the fact he lives in the country, I was born in a small town and lived in a few of them, also my mom lived in the country/small town. It's like with any of us that come to an age or that point in life where we want more, we want that's not just something for heroes but anybody that wants to get out of a small town or venture beyond the states.I even like one moment when Luke at first is reluctant which is something I can be sometimes. Luke at first is reluctant which is something I can be sometimes. That doesn't mean he's chickening out or in some sense of doubtful, far from it. It's a common feeling because deep inside despite hearing the call, we don't' feel we're 100%ready, mentally, spiritually/physically strong enough, have something that still needs to be finished or learned any of those things. But of course it comes down to the other step where Luke loses his home and family which in a grim sense sets him on the course he needs to go as it reminds him of the evil of the empire that there is no safe place from it, but also sort of a coming of age parable on saying the past is gone it's time to go to the future.Characters are great, each of them is memorable in their own way. I mainly love the rebel trio Luke, Han and Leia whom to me really are the heart of the film as they all balance each other out, work well together but most importantly actually make a difference. Luke of course is no surprise one of my favorite characters played by one of my favorite actors/voice actors Mark Hamill.Leia Organa played well by the late Carrie Fisher. Her character was revolutionary for her time because despite the Princess role, she's anything but a damsel in distress, makes sense as this film was from the 70's and strong female characters were starting to sprout up like Jennifer Hart from the TV show 'Hart to Hart', the angels from 'Charlies Angels' (not a fan of the show for the record but like the theme song), you name it, it was a trend. I always loved strong female characters not just from the fact they can fight back but are actual characters.Anyway what I like about her is that despite being in the upper class she doesn't let it get to her head, she is fiercely independent, can hold her own against danger, and has a strong determination as she is just a piece that serves a cause bigger than herself, which is the same with Luke and Han whether they all know it or not.Of course, the other is Han Solo played by another on of my favorite actors Harrison Ford. Han is still my favorite role from him, and Han is another of my favorite fictional protagonists. He was just so cool, from that cowboy like outfit, that ship he drives the Millennium Falcon which is my second favorite ship in the franchise.It's hilarious how it's always looked at like as junk, it makes sense if you think about it like how we look at an old car. In a way you can say we along with Han see it just as Columbo sees his old clunker car, despite old it still runs real well and has plenty of millage left, though with the Millennium Falcon it goes wicked fast with that light speed function.Anyway, I love that he's tough and fiercely independent, even like his friend Chewbacca who is sort of the equivalent of a pet dog as he is loyal a good number two and muscle. On a side note thought Chewbacca was a werewolf as he almost looks and acts like one sometimes. He's got a sharp charisma and also has a sort of everyman perspective on everything, it feel like how any of us may react or feel about things like how he doesn't believe in the force, which is understandable everyone is entitled to their belief system.But one thing I really like that I can emphasize with is he's also a little bit of a reluctant hero himself as he's a person that really doesn't want or even like to do the right thing, whenever it's brought up you can tell he sometimes grits his teeth. Though with him deep down he really does want to even though he has trouble admitting it, and most of the time he does it when driven/motivated to it. But also, does it because no one else will/can also what the heck else is going to do anyway.I also really like him because all three you can say share one thing in common as that each of them is looking and want more out of life. Han despite all his travels and the money he collects, despite once again not admitting it, that he's unfulfilled there is something missing in his life. He's been going multiple directions throughout his life but never any real destination until now.The action is great it goes a pace that almost never stops. The lightsaber battle between both Darth and Obi Wan Kenobi was solid, just those sounds those sabers made were just music to my ears. But it was also verbal sparing as both say some of the best lines to one another. That shootout in the detention center, it was so exciting how the firefight started just seeing Luke, Han, Chewbacca shoot up the place, I remember acting in excitement pretending I had a gun and just shot everywhere from those Imperial jerk and anything else shooting at the trio.One of my favorite shootouts the turret action in the Millennium Falcon, I remember pretending to be sitting in that cockpit, turning in that chair and blasting away at the ongoing Ties. Along with that music from John Williams was just exciting really pumped you full of excitement.To the final half with the aerial assault on the Death Star with those X-Wings which are one of my favorite star fighter ships. Early like the design of them and how they move, I wanted to fly one.I remember as a kid on the edge of my seat when that X-Wing action happened I couldn't help but move with them have my hand up pretending I was flying one of them and just blowing away at the Death Star and the Tie Fighters; along with that music once again pumping me up with excitement. And there is that trench run which is one of the most suspenseful moments ever as you are just hoping someone mainly Luke will get though fast enough to blow the Death Star away.Last this film was one of the films that inspired me in writing, filmmaking, and so many other things. When I saw everything that happened in that film, from the world and universe building it just made me wonder if I could create something just as good or at least really good things in life, and to this day I still create good things. But also it inspired me by making me believe in courage to have the ability to do what is right no matter what and how one person can actually become more than what they are, that they can actually go beyond their own homestead.'Star Wars' is an adventure beyond your wildest dreams and a universe built and for the dreamers.Rating: 4 stars",10,0,0,12 May 2020
Cloud Atlas," Time Passages
","Individuals actions and decisions throughout the ages are strange things because it always seems to be the littlest things that lead up to something more and turn into something even more as time goes on. Is it really just free will or is it a higher purpose that guides us as if it was written in the stars. This is just one of the mysteries of life but also this move.It's one of those films you really don't see every day, the film is practically a puzzle within a puzzle, it's one of those ones where you have to watch again just to uncover more. And I love those kinds of films because the enigma is part of what makes the film a rich experience.The characters I think our great there are a lot of them because there are a lot of stories; their not the deepest characters but you do know enough to care about them and what they do knowing the decisions and actions they execute will lead to something. I liked the performances of the actors and actresses Tom Hanks, Hale Berry, Hugo Weving, Susan Surandon, and others, what was great about their performances was the fact in each of the stories they all played different characters which to me is a great but fun acting challenge and they all passed. From the different accents they had to execute but physically the different make up they all had to wear and the make up work is perfect in some of the other stories some of the actors are literally unrecognizable you really would think they were different people.But most importantly I really love the story structure because it's something truly different. All of the stories are linear but there is a multitude of them, all in different settings and are told at once and not in any particular order or time. Each of them are connected and unconnected in a way, they also seem to be a Chex Mix of genres all to make a tasty snack. One story is a drama, another a suspense thriller, another some tomorrows world sci-fi, another a mix of both post apocalyptic and final frontier sci-fi, and any other genre or sub genre you can think of. There all about something and yet at the same time their not I'll leave it up to you to make your own conclusion about that but I think that's the point.Two of my favorite ones no doubt are the two stories that take place in the future, what can I say I'm a sci-fi fan. One story which is a tomorrows world story is great I really love the production value that was put into that, most of that was CGI but it was used well and with great detail, it's a future obviously reminiscent of 'Blade Runner'. But what I liked in that story was the concept was really dark as we see it's a future that has completely sold out their free will, enviorment and morals toward consumerism, greed and gluttony. The technology in that story is fascinating the use of touch and hand motion screens and others things. I like the main character whom is sympathetic and out of her element as well and the significant other helping her, it's almost reminiscent of the sci-fi gem 'The Fifth Element' which also had the same dynamic.And the other which is the post apocalyptic/final frontier sci-fi story. Really like the look of the post apocalyptic world where it's looks and feels almost alien because of how different it is from the way people talk which is almost a Cajun like tone and certain customs. I like the chemistry between both Tom Hanks and Halle character, how conflicted in emotions both are, but also how both sort of represent they classic dynamic of nature and technology, old and new contemporary wisdom.I've said enough, Cloud Atlas is a journey throughout the ages you never know where it begins but you don't want it to end.Rating: 4 stars",10,14,27,28 October 2012
Monty Python and the Holy Grail," Fractured Fantasy
","The King Arthur legend is no doubt one of my favorite fantasies and throughout the years there have been multiple interpretations of the legend in the visual medium, so good and some bad but all the same that legend like so many other stories has lived on even to this day. I was even fascinated with the concept of lost/undiscovered relics and the Holy Grail of course is one of them, let alone on a side note I'm a Christian. Parodies comedies are another thing I really love and when I heard that there was a parody on this legend, I had to check it out and I wasn't disappointed. This film is one of my favorite comedies, parodies in the sub genre, but also one of my favorite films in general. On a side note this was the film that got me into the 'Monty Python Flying Circus' skit show which at the time I never heard about.There's really not much to say, this is one of those parodies that are done right like in most parodies it takes a story and turns it upside down and on it's head, while the characters all play it straight all unaware their in a parody. The whole flying circus ensemble are all in the film and they all as usual do a great job at making us laugh let alone, the fact they all play multiple roles in the movie.Both the verbal and visual jokes are just fraking hilarious. Though I wouldn't say everyone of them are hits, like that whole verbal joke on swallows I always thought was boring but that's me. But that's what you get with most comedies and parodies, it's the ones that hit that count the most. Like in their skit show, each of the jokes are hilarious because of how smart or strange they really are; let alone how the film isn't afraid to go the extra mile sometimes with it's blood and violence which was revolutionary for it's time, it's now common in shows like 'South Park'.There are so many scenes that are just memorable that I don't want to give them all away. From the introduction of the Holy Hand Grenade it's pretty much a verbal and visual joke going together, from the fact the item has a biblical passage, let alone it even exists in the Christian faith at all. But of course my favorite scene is The Tale of Sir Lancelot, where we see Lancelot battling. Well OK, I wouldn't really call it a battle, it was more of a slaughter as we see Lance is just constantly killing everyone in the castle not even stopping to take a breath, what makes it really hilarious is the fact that no one is putting up any resistance they've all practically set themselves up to be killed. I even love that swashbucking music which makes the sequence both exciting and all the more hilarious because it reflects just how crazy things really are.I love how in a way the film itself is a character, from it's fourth wall breaking to just how aware of how low budget the film is made. Like the whole pretend horse thing which is hilarious because you easily see the person making the film is a complete money grubber that he didn't want to shell the money to buy real horses. Though all the same it's just hilarious how the actors for pretend horses still perform really well, as if they really are on horses. Let alone the ending which cracks me up because it's a payoff to a really strange subplot that's been going on, the subplot seemed like another episode from some procedural show. You could say it's if the procedural shows like 'CSI', 'NCIS', or any other you can think of ever crossed over with a fantasy story which when you think about is kinda a crazy but cool concept.This film like the legend of the grail is ageless.Rating: 4 stars",10,1,2,16 June 2014
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," Conflict in the Shadow of Darkness
","Conflict is never a one-sided affair, where there is great victory for one side comes great tragedy for another. This film is one of my favorite films of all time, it's my favorite 'Star Wars' film of all time and my favorite sequel of all time.Indeed, this truly is one of the not just the best sequels that really helped set the standard in how to continue a franchise but also just simply established 'Star Wars' as a saga in general. Let alone this is probably one of the darkest sequels ever as it's not the most cheerful which to me makes the film and story all the better because as an old saying goes sometimes when things are at their worst, is the time when people are at their best.The action is great, there are lots of memorable action pieces like one of my favorite battles of all time of course is the Battle at Hoth. I really love those Imperial Walkers I thought they were just awesome looking and at the same time really menacing as they look like giant dogs. I really love the model designs and stop motions effects by the late great Phil Tippit.There were also the first mechs I've ever seen, I really like how they move which is tank like which makes sense as they're by their nature giant tanks. Personally, I don't mind in fact sometimes like that kind of movement in mechs the best, as opposed to the flighty movement you would see in anime like 'Gundam'. Let alone the fact that these Walkers don't go down so easily, where in most anime despite how awesome looking the mecha is, they always seem to be built so flimsy as they go down in one hit or two. In a way this battle was sort of like a David vs. Goliath battle as we see the Rebels devise a clever tactic to taking down the Walkers which is cool because it's simple.The space chase with Han, Leia, Chewbacca, and C3PO is also awesome as we see they are all just jumping though hoops and going though the motions, doing their best getting steps ahead of the Imperial pursuers. Like going through the asteroid field which really put my on the edge of my seat as we know one wrong move your dead. Along with the cave they were all hiding in which to me is probably one of the biggest close calls ever, literally.Along with the saber action, really liked seeing Luke use the light saber a bit more in the film even the fight with Darth Vader which is one of my favorite one of one battles of all time. Sure, there was the fight between Obi Wan and Vader in the first film, but this fight I thought was a lot better because there was a lot more to the fight. From seeing not just Luke and Vader clash with he sabers but also utilizing and even using what's in their environment as their weapon. I even like in this battle it really feels like it could go either way, despite how skilled Luke is it might not be enough as Vader is more experienced. Or even from how the fight goes there are moments when it seems Luke might be able to turn the tables but there are times when it really looks like fate isn't smiling on Luke.The story and what I love in the sequel is that the character is better than before where their a little more fleshed out, three dimensional and less archetypical which makes us care about them more.From Han and Leia, both are one of my favorite fictional couples of all time. It sort of fit with the 80's decade as there were lots of TV shows based on romantic couples like 'Moonlighting', 'Macross', etc. Like with those shows both conflict and romance just go together and make a beautiful combo as both are somewhat the same, what is romance without conflict and love can really hurt and be scary sometimes. But most importantly in both this and those shows we already know these two belong together and are going to come together but it's a question of when.I really love the banter between both, which is funny but also endearing, both are somewhat opposites in many ways from class to just simply disagreement on just about anything to everything. But many both are in conflict because of how both feel for one another which is love. Han is more forward with his feelings despite not outwardly confessing and Leia is constantly in denial or confusion over hers which is why she is unable to admit her feelings to both him and she. As both spend more time together, we see just like any ship going out of light speed their feelings start emerging, which also makes what happens in the end even more tragic.Luke as usual is being Luke though here we see he's became a little more mature as he is now a rebel commander, so he's taken a little more responablity in both his career and life. However, that and time has not quilled a certain fire in his soul that is blazing out of control as Luke has became a lot more impatient and reckless which unfortunately leads to some bad choices that not just Yoda and Obi Wan are in disagreement with but us also. Sure, in some of those choices he had good intentions and in one scene goes out to help, but as two old sayings go, 'good intentions are nothing if there is no follow though' and 'good deeds don't go unpunished.' Things like that just show Luke still has a ways to go in the way of the Jedi.Darth Vader as usual is himself but we see he's a little more ruthless and even angrier than before which is reflected from his relentless determination throughout the film down to even offing anyone that makes one error too many. But what I like about him in this film is you get a little character out of him. There is an actual sense of emotion in his pursuit for Skywalker. This really deepens the mystery of the character more. Really liked one scene where he is talking with his master 'The Emperor' whom we see for the first time, where it seems like in the conversation Vader voice sounds like he cares about Luke and what happens to him, but we're not sure why.Of course there is the new edition Yoda whom is voiced brilliantly by Frank Oz best known for his puppetry and vocal work in 'The Muppet Show' and 'Sesame Street', really like the look of the alien which is cute looking but also has a respectability about him. Yoda is one of my favorite characters in the franchise, to me he's sort of an alien version of Mr. Myogi. Just like Myogi he has his comical side but when the comedy ends, he really gets down to business. From the tone of his voice you really buy him as a person with a heavy amount of wisdom as well as emotion which makes both Luke and us take him seriously.The other thing is the story which I feel is both a rich sci-fi fantasy adventure but at the same time a rich personal character drama. The plotline we see the good guys are in a very bad place despite scoring a goal, the puck is now in the bad guys court and they are hitting them hard. Really like in this film we see some really dire locations from the Ice Planet Hoth, the swampy dank Dagobah system, and even part of the lower levels of Cloud City it really reflects the state and state of mind the good guys are in, all bad. But I like how despite this the good guys aren't going to sit there and take it; they might go down but their not doing it without a fight.The ensemble throughout the film are all split up, their barely together in the film except in a scene or two. But this actually turns out to be a good thing because it give each of the characters a chance to have their own story all interconnected into one big one; as well as us to become better acquainted with them and understand more of the universe they occupy.I really love some of the philosophy going on in the film which is mainly in the Jedi Training at Dagobah; it's richly thoughtful and one of the first films that actually go me into Philosophy. Really love seeing the Jedi Training going on, which kind of makes the film 'The Karate Kid' in space. You really see how just like in any walk of life it takes hard work to become a warrior or anything else you want to be in life. Also the philosophy in the film really taught me about what fear really is and where it comes from, but also about the power of faith and what it really means.Then of course there is the big reveal near the end of the film, which was a total shocker at the time, even I was one of the people shocked I remember thinking 'You've got to be fraking kidding me!'. It was something I couldn't see 30 to 40 miles away. And I love that, I felt it was an example of a twist when done the right way, there was never any hints throughout the movie and there were never any in the previous film. This made it even more effective but also all the more dramatic because it actually makes sense.As an old saying goes, 'the battle may be lost, but the war is far from over.'Rating: 4 stars",10,0,0,9 January 2020
Mad Max: Fury Road," The Mad and the Furious
","This is one of my personal favorite films. I'm actually a fan of the Mad Max films, I really liked the first one, second one 'The Road Warrior' was even better and is also a personal favorite film of mine. It was a long wait for this film like reaching the destination of any long road trip it was well worth the trip.I really like the look of the post apocalyptic world which I feel just like with 'The Road Warrior' is in a wider scope, it's dark and yet fascinating at the same time. Despite the lack of certain technologies they at least have some technology that works but of course the most valued are the automobiles which is to me what makes the post apocalyptic world fascinating because it's a automobile subculture taken to the extreme.It also really looks like the Mad/insane have truly taken over the earth. And it seems like Max and Furiosa along with others are literally almost the last sane people on Earth. Which really creates that isolation feeling.Nicholas Hoult as Nux I though was a fun character and actually has a really solid character arc. He's crazy and yet he's actually really smart which makes him useful to the crew.Tom Hardy is excellent as Max Rochatansky, I really love the voice which is kinda rough and gravelly tone. Max is well still Max, it's true he doesn't say much in the film but Max wasn't known much for talk anyway because he's a man of action. And I like that as usual he's reluctant to do the right thing but he does it anyway because of how driven he is by his conscious and lets face it what else is he going to do.Charlize Theron was just fantastic as Imperator Furiosa. She's one on my favorite fictional feme fatales up there with Betrix Kiddo (Kill Bill), Ripley (Aliens) and others on my list (I said my list) and literally steals the show. Her character is just true to her name as she is just driven by fury and is just hellbent to her task willing to mow down anyone that gets in her way. I love that she can kick some serious ass and takes crap from no one, she literally almost beats Max in a one on one fisticuff fight which I always find cool seeing a supporting protagonist beating or coming close to beating the main one which I don't see enough of.Both Max and her have an excellent back and forth, in a way it's sort of the first time Max had a go two person that was a match for him and Furiosa is more that one for him. Both in a way are almost the same in a way as both have been robbed of their family and are mad at the gangs, the world and themselves.I like that with all three characters they have something in common all three want redemption. For Max in his mind he failed to protect his wife and child from the scum in this world. Nux wants to be a hero but has been playing for the wrong team. Furiosa was practically kidnapped and forced to be one of Joe's solders. This one task in transporting the slave girls to salvation is to them is the thing they need the mos to make some difference in the mad world, and of course what their doing amounts to making a big difference.The villain I thought was solid, fun and memorable, Immortan Joe played by Hugh Keys Bryne whom played the main villain in the first film. Which is really cool because in a way it makes things come full circle. I really like the look of him, he really looks like Sweet Tooth from the 'Twisted Metal' video games. I really like the voice which is menacing and you can tell from his mannerism he is completely crazy and nasty from the inside out, which is just all the more motive for all three protagonists to get away from him.But like with most of the Mad Max films we're all really in it for the action and automobiles and both have plenty of gas and speed to keep you entertained.The automobiles are also the stars of the film and their terrific. I really love the designs of each of the automobiles which all look like they could be on the roster list in the 'Twisted Metal' video game franchise. Each of them are uniquely colorful, dangerous and crazy looking. From one vehicle that is a mobile rock concert where there are enough amps to make anyone go deaf and there is some crazy mummy guy playing a guitar that also doubles for a flame thrower. Another with a crazy amount of spikes front to back, it's practically a mobile porcupine. The action is just fantastic, the stunt work and chirography in fight but also automotive driving is spot on. And it's over the top violence which makes it even better where automobiles are just exploding left and right, bodies and body parts are just flying, heads are getting blown off, and so forth.I really love the fact that this film is kinda one big chase movie which is great because it makes the film simplistic no boring bull crap, the pacing in this film is just constantly going almost like in the film 'Speed' where you hardly have time to take a breath. One of the action sequences I really liked was seeing Max just jump on one rival vehicle after another and just beating the crap or killing any of baddies manning them, it just sort of remind me of Swashbulckling action.Well I've said enough, Max is back and still has plenty of millage for fun.Rating: 4 stars",10,6,16,18 May 2015
The Breakfast Club," High School Blues
","In high school I've always passed by a lot of people and even some of the clichés there in. I've always wondered even to this day, who was that person that passed by, what were they thinking, or what did that person think about when she looked at me.This film is one of my favorite movies in general and it's my favorite teen film from one of my favorite script writers John Hughes. John Hughes just always knew how to mix both humor and humanity very well, most of it from the dialog they delivered which felt like something any everyday person would say. Or even the amount of depth each of the characters had and that they were all in some amount of pain that most of use everyday deal with.Watching this film as a teenager it really blew me away because it really talked to me. Looking at this film now as an adult it's like reading a journal passage, I'm able to say yeah that happened to me.The whole film is pretty much like one big bottle episode, this film I feel executes it well, despite it being a film where nothing really happens it has an energy that just keeps things moving so you don't feel like you've been in there too long. And due to the dialog, depth and what each of the characters due in their time in a confined space, it keeps itself interesting.I even like how they use the school library which I'll admit is probably the most impressive library I've ever seen, it looks more like a collage library. But I like how spacious it is and really induces a positive atmosphere and freedom of movement which works to the characters advantage because here they have total freedom to do and be whatever they want. The humor is great from the suttle to big jokes. One of my favorite jokes no down is seeing Andrew as he is a bit stoned he is dancing and doing some gymnastics to some rock music on the second floor of the library and we see that moment when he breaks the glass door by just screaming at it. That always cracked me up, this guy has superhuman vocals. But also that's just something I'd love to do if I ever had the library or a mall to myself.The characters are all great, because their all three dimensional their not the steriotyipcial teen you might see in one crappy TV teen drama too many, but in a way actually feel like people that actually can exist.Bender played well by Judd Nelson is a lot of fun. He's a so called rebel that is a blow hole that you love to dislike or like depending on the time. Yes the guy is a bit guilty of anti social behavior, there are times he can really be antagonizing from his attention getting complex and comes really close to pressing that wrong button with everyone.However my favorite character is Alison played by Ally Sheedy. I'll admit when I was a kid I actually did have a crush on this actress, yeah I know there was Molly Ringwold but I was just attracted to Ally more. This is my favorite role from her as she plays a shy girl, her character literally doesn't say a whole lot in the film but to me she doesn't need to, sometimes you say a lot by not saying anything at all.This character in a way is a lot like myself in real life, OK not entirely but there are some thing about her I can relate to. The fact that she doesn't talk much, and it's not always because she's shy it's just that she doesn't feel a need to talk and when she talks she feels like it or there actually is something to talk about.Other things I like is the fact that she's an introvert, this girl is just constantly full of surprises from her quaky need to take random things for no particular reason but we also see that she's an talented artist as she was able to draw a really detailed landscape sketch. Even like some of her chemistry with Andrew, despite there being not many interaction scenes between the two I really felt both made a connection.I really love it when we finally get down to the really serious stuff when finally everyone just opens up. One issue I can really relate to is Brian's when he talks about the pressure he has to go though everyday to maintain being a A student and to never get an F because his family can't have it. This really made me feel for Brian not just the fact I was also like him but that it really gets an issue about our education system how they've set the bar too high. I know there is such a think as challenging intelligent minds but there is such a thing as being too challenging, which to me always messes me up and depletes morale. I do believe in success but you also have to let people be people.The ending is interesting because it's open ended and sort of left to your interpretation because after their time is over you can't help but wonder what's going to happen Monday morning, or if all or any of them will remain friends. But so it goes with life itself, they all got though today but tomorrow is a new day. However it also has a sense of hope as each of them in that short span of time have all grown a little and because what they all truly are people.The real education is outside the classroom.Rating: 4 stars",10,0,1,21 January 2015
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," Holy Crusaders
","This is one of my favorite films of all time and it's my second favorite in the Indiana Jones franchise.I really like the plotline which makes sense just as the Ark of the Covenant was a lost holy relic it makes sense that the Holy Grail would be next. This one is a little different because it's not just a matter of finding it but it's a race against evil, as they want the grail for nefarious purposes. The fact this evil force are the greatest scumbags in history the Nazis just more makes us want Indy and his fellow crusaders to win.The music is great, of course the score is by John Williams one of my favorite composers, this sequel has the usual trademark theme, but I like thought the film there are lots of memorable and beautiful scores. From the usual theme to certain other tracks like when the bad guys show up in the action and suspense sequences.The action is great there are a lot of fun memorable sequences. One of my favorites are the tank which to me is one of my favorite battles of all time. I really like how it's divided into steps almost like a level in a video game where in step one, Indiana has to find a way to get close and board the tank while trying not to get blown away, step two it becomes a moving platform battle as Indiana fights of some of the Nazi that board to get him off, and step three Indiana has to fight off the Nazi Colonel whom is like the boss of the level.But I also really love most of the suspenseful moments, from one really good sequence which was both suspenseful and funny where both Indy and his father Henry are in a stick situation that just goes from bad to worse as both are tied up on chairs and their trying to free themselves and get the heck out.
Even the three challenges is great which is one of the most suspense sequences ever, I remember literally being on the edge of my seat and actually worrying for Indy's life as he is forced to go thought the deadly gauntlet of traps, with the three clues in the journal as his only defense. Like in one sequence when it got to the second challenge which is sort of like the board game 'Password' only you can die if God Forbid you step on a wrong letter. Once I saw Indiana Jones about to make a mistake I remember yelling 'Noooo!'But also, what really powers the film are both Indiana Jones and his father Henry. This really makes this film different from the other Indy films because this plays out a bit like a buddy cop film, which makes sense as the 80's were big with that subgenre with 'Lethal Weapon' and others. Its kind of cool and fitting that Sean Connery plays Indy's dad as the actor is well known for playing the Iconic pulp hero James Bond, so James Bond is Indiana Jones dad, well sort of. However we don't see Sean doing any fighting, which makes sense story wise as Henry is an archaeologist but not a trained fighter like his son, but I like despite being an ordinary guy with ordinary powers he does hold his own against danger and helps his son out anyway he can, like any good father should.I really love the back and forth between both, it's sort of a bronze and brains relationship as Indiana is the one that does the most ass kick while Henry does the most thinking along the way. Really like seeing both clash with one another as both give each other grief intentionally though most of the time unintentionally, but also get along and work well with one another, much like the relations with our own parents. I also like how we see slight differences and similarities between both of them, which is true with all of us that have grown up with some similarities and traits of our parents but we significant differences which make both them and ourselves our own people.From the fact that both have a fascination with archaeology but Indiana's despite his knowledge in archelogy his approach is more direct, on the field and learning more along the way. Henry is a more laid-back approach as he knows more thoroughly he's a guy that sits down and takes his time researching and thinking before applying. I can emphasize with both these things as I feel I do a little of both.But what I really love about his film is it has heart; the film is sort of a Christian movie which is fitting as they are finding a lost artifact from the Christian faith. But it has some theme like in faith not so much in God but in yourself. Really like that we get a little of Indiana's stance in the Christian faith; he is a Christian but not a highly practiced one which is understandable as he's invested most of his time in his field of science Archaeology and with his expeditions it's not like he has time to go to church, let alone the fact wherever he goes it's not like there is a Church around.But also, about family as we see Indy throughout the adventure at the same time is mending his relationship with his father. Both have a bit of a strained relationship, most of this caused by Indy's father's lifelong pursuit of the grail which may have caused a certain amount of dissonance. We see some of that in the beginning of the film of a young Indy played well by the late River Phenix, that sequence was fun on it's own as it was way before the notion of prequels and was a bit of a set up for that TV series 'Young Indiana Jones' which I feel is an under the radar gem.It's really touching as both throughout the adventure we see both actually growing closer, which makes us all the more care for both characters and hope both will succeed in both their mission and relationship with each other.Sometimes real treasure is closer than we think.Rating: 4 stars",10,0,0,5 March 2020
Back to the Future," Race Against Time
","This is another of one of my favorite films of all time. This film is special to me in so many ways, from the fact that it's another film from my childhood I saw this when I was about seven years old. But most importantly this was the very first time travel sci-fi I've ever seen and it's still my favorite in the sci-fi subgenera. Back then I never even heard of the genre and the concept, this film is one hell of an introductory, it was a concept that blew me away the ability to travel anywhere throughout time; personally, for me I'd love to revisit the 80's decade which is funny to say since this film was made in the 80's. You could also say this was the film that steered me to my favorite TV show of all time 'Doctor Who'.This film just has so much, I really like the story which is fun and clever at the same time. One thing this film does well is the fact things aren't overcomplicated, the fundamental problem with most time travel stories are sometimes they have this stupid need to complicate things or play around too much which really swiss cheeses the story in plot and consistence or that it's overly concerned on the concept and logic but little on story. This film keeps things simple because it keeps the car on the road, by keeping the focus on character and story. Sure, there is a slight complication and inconsistency in this story but it's not noticeable not even concerned about it, even I wasn't and let's face it all time travels stories have this. The film also kind of stays true to the pulp sci-fi as their concern was for story and adventure and logic was shelved.The characters are great from Biff Tannen played well by underrated actor Thomas F Wilson whom is one of my favorite fictional villians as throughout the film series he's had several versions of himself about as many as any Time Lord from 'Doctor Who'. He's a villain you love to hate, yeah, he's basically a bully whom I normally despise but here it's handled right where he's a person you easily can despise but have fun with at the same time. He has some of the best lines, but I think what really makes him stand out is the fact that he's an idiot. Despite the guy being big and strong, having the best car, it's all really just a way to pass himself as cool, the guy literally thinks he's really cool even though in reality everyone around him knows he a dirtbag.But of course, the two characters that really make the film are Marty and Doc Emit Brown played by two of my favorite actors Michael J Fox and Christopher Lloyd. These two are defiantly one of my favorite duos, both play off each other and balance each other out well.Marty McFly is great he's one of my favorite fictional protagonists because he's someone I can easily emphasize with as I was a kid from the 80's and I can epaphisize with bits of his persona. As he's a teen from the 80's, as he's into skateboarding, music, camcorders, and a lot of things in the 80s, I'm a kid from the 80's I was into that stuff too. He's kind of on the rebellious side, but he's more of a silent rebel as he doesn't always feel a total need to follow every rule, as he sometimes undermines the school principal, even I'm like that sometimes. But what I like about him is he's a person that has big dreams and ambitions, he wants his band to play in big events and also make music in the music world, however he has faced his series of rejections yeah, I can emphasize with that with my acting auditions; however he doesn't give up despite how much it hurts. Though also has dreams of love with his significant other Jennifer played well by Claudia Wells whom I thought was kind of hot, you really get a good feel for her and both of them as they've been a couple for a long time.I really like how Marty reacts to the 1950's decade, since he a kid from the 80's it's easy for me to emphasize with him since I was one to. To some people that either lived or close the decade of the 50's or historians that have some fascination with it, it would be a dream come true to be able to come back to it. But for a person like Marty and myself, we wouldn't really like it not to say it's a place I wouldn't mind visiting but not one I'd want to say in ; for one thing Marty traveled their unintentionally and with time travel machines you'd have the freedom to stroll out the door anytime you want but his freedom has been prohibited so that sucks. However, I really like in the first sequence of going to 1950's Hill Valley how disoriented and even scared he looks, I'm sure that would be how we would react to walking to a decade long gone it's like walking into another world. From seeing vintage cars, you would see in a car museum being driven conveniently, old songs you'd hear on an oldies but goodies on a sat radio station being played as if they've just made the billboard, certain things that aren't around yet like video games or further seasons of 'Doctor Who', it wouldn't exactly be like going to a vacation spot.It's also funny in the film how Marty in an inadvertent way affects things not just from how he brings his parents together but also how may 'be he was one factor that may have helped get certain things in our modern-day culture started. Like the music he plays in the school dance, the skateboard, you name it. To me that's part of the what makes the film it funny and fascinating, it really shows how one person can really have a big affect on time without know it but also how one person truly can make a difference. Though it also brings up the parallel dynamic between both Marty and the 50's decade as both were a time of great changes from youth to culture.Doc Brown is just great as he's is a genius but is a bit childlike as he does have a bit of an eccentricity from his hairstyle which always seems to be stick up to even how rapidly inventive he is. However, he does have a good dose of common sense and wisdom which keeps him from not flying off the road but also able to interact properly and mentor Marty. But one thing about him I can easily emphasize with is on how fast he is, he the kind of person that loves to do lots of things and get things done but is aware he has limited time to do them. Like in one scene, he has built a rather elaborate scale model of the town but is apologetic that he didn't have enough time to paint and give it details, despite the fact it's looks great all the same. I just find that a little funny because I'm sort of like that myself where sometimes I get one thing done but there is one other thing I haven't got done yet or I wanted to do within the given time.I really love the DeLorean, it's my second favorite time traveling machine next to the Tardis on 'Doctor Who' which you know is my first. Making a time traveling machine out of a car was unheard of at the time, personal I thought it was a cool idea and really is a lot more convient because with it you will not just travel back or forwards in time, but you'd be able to drive within that time period where ever you need to go and hide it better by driving to a spot. The effects on that DeLorean are cool just every time it travels in time it just leaves a vapor trail of fire on the road. Music is also great this film has probably one of the best soundtracks I know. From the theme song from Alvin Silvestri which perfectly reflects the movie as it has an adventurous tone. Another trademark are two other songs from the film 'The Power of Love' and 'Back in Time' by Huey Lewis and the News. As well as a few familiar oldies but goodies tracks, most notably the song 'Johnny Be Good' at the dance.There are lots of fun moments I won't say them all since there are so many which makes the better because there's not one dull moment, from the big highlight for me is the Skateboard sequence which is one of my favorite chase scenes, here it's a skateboard skating away from an automobile. When you think about it being on a skateboard does have its advantages as Marty is able to ride on sidewalks and certain roadways and areas that an automobile would have a hard time accessing, which means plenty of opportunities to outmaneuver his opponent. But also, the fact that Marty is using a skateboard in the 1950's decade alone is really cool, since they didn't have skateboards back then. To even the small moments my favorite which is to me one of the best reference jokes ever when Marty puts himself in the Rad suit and is tricking George to asking Lorene out by mixing up two popular sci-fi franchises, that segment always cracks me up being a sci-fi fan.Well I've said enough, 'Back to the Future' is a timeless classic that has the millage that goes beyond time.Rating: 4 stars",10,1,1,5 August 2018
Beetlejuice," Ghost with the Most
","I'm a kid from the 80's, this is once again another timeless relics from my favorite decade of movies. This film was Tim Burton's first film on the silver screen and it was a great start from him most of the time first movies from first timers tend to disappoint me; and I personally think it's still one of his best. It stands out because it was something different that you haven't seen before and you have to just see to believe; from it's style but most importantly the content and manic energy which is the reason this film just like the ghosts are timeless to me.The music score by one of my favorite composers Danny Elfman is great, it's a strange lighthearted Gothic tune. The production value is great was obviously inspired by artist 'Salvador Dali' with that desert as well as the hallways and doorways of the spirit realm. This also helps create that really odd surrealistic fantasy world tone from the real world that looks like a typical boring 'Norman Rockwell' like enviorment it feels too strange to be true, some of the interior and exterior of the Dieetz's home, down to the spirit realm itself. Along with the special effects which I think still look great today, there is no CGI which make it all the better, from stop motion effects like the Sand Worms which are comical and nasty looking down to the make up effects. This is another reason as to how special this film is film I feel is one of the best prime examples of the use of special effects in a comedy that works because their used for the right reasons and not mere gimmicks.But most important is the humor, the humor is great mixing in horror with comedy which I always think is a beautiful mix, but also just the mixture of verbal and visual humor that make it memorable, which is just done to perfection here I can't say that about many others out there. From the antics of Bettlejuice which I already mentioned down to others without him, from the infamous Day-O dinner scene, but my favorite no doubt is with the dead Football players one of them says something and the case worker Juno (played with brilliant dry charisma by Sylvia Sidney)replies back, I don't want to give it away but trust me one you hear it you'll crack up. But also just the logic or illogic of the spirit realm that is created, it's funny because of how strange it is but also fills you with wonder I can't help but wonder if there really is a lot more to that spirit realm I still don't know about.The characters are great through the two that really stick out for me the most are Beetlejuice and Lydia Deetz, no surprise there.Beetlejuice is played by one of my favorite actor's Michael Keaton to me this actually is my favorite role from him. Beetlejuice is one of my favorite fictional villains that I don't hate, he's pretty much a dirty insane amoral butt head that just wants to create/cause havoc for no reason, I like some of the tricks he pulls which are fun but many just his charisma some of the things he says and the way he delivers them are just hilarious; like the commercial he did which was obviously a parody on those car commercial which always had that country western vibe for some weird reason.And of course one of the protagonists Lydia Deetz played by one of my favorite actresses Wynoma Rider is great and this was the role that put her on the map. I remember as a kid having a crush on this actress she's just fraking hot, made me wonder why the hell couldn't I find any goth girls in my high school not just looked that hot but had the persona to boot. Anyway, Lydia is just great because she's a character I can emphasize with a bit, I wasn't a goth but like her I was an outsider. Like the fact that she is always wearing funerary or goth , she just looks so good no matter what she wears. But I just love her persona she has dry charisma and I like the fact she's fascinated with the supernatural, I also am fascinated with unexplained phenomena of ghosts, UFOs, and other things. I also find her kinda a character of sympathy because she is lonely and feels sort of out of place, clearly her character really don't fit the superficial reality she's been forced to live with, another thing I can emphasize with because even I've had those feelings; and we pretty much see her struggling to find her place in the world but it really is closer than she thinks.Well, that's all I have to say, this film has the juice.Rating: 4 stars",10,1,2,21 May 2012
The Wizard of Oz," Colorful Wonderland
","Imagination and fantasy to me is always one of the most crucial things to have in life because whenever we retreat everyday to whatever world we construct in our minds we fuel hope and belief that there really is more beyond where we are currently residing, but also become more than what we are.This is one of my favorite fantasy films of all time, which is no surprise. I saw this film when I was about 7 years old, I really got into it because I love fantasy I really loved the Fairy Tales my mom read to me. I loved the film then and as an adult I still love watching it today, it just has so much going for it and not just was it a prime example of a fantasy film done right but also how we all saw film in general.The production value is just fantastic even to this day it's just a feast for the eyes, from the use of mat painting which really gave the illusion of a broad land. Though it's true in some scenes you can easily tell it's a painting in the background but that didn't deter the film for me, in fact it just added to the value of the film making this film beautiful mix of the theatrical and film. Let alone I'd prefer mat painting most of the time over a CGI background anytime where with them even a grade schooler can tell the CGI is fake. The mat background is just beautiful, it's like certain pieces you can put up in an art gallery, from the hills to the emerald city. I really love the use of color, this film has more color than a craola crayon box or the film 'Sin City' it not just helps bring out this fantasy realm but also feels like Dorothy has walked right into a painting, from the flowers, the ground, munchkin land just everything you just must see to believe.The music is just great there are so many memorable songs that are just timeless classics. From 'We off to see the Wizard' which is always a fun song. I even like the songs of both the 'Scarecrow' and 'Tin Man' singing about what they lack in life. But of course, no surprise my favorite song is 'Somewhere over the Rainbow' it is just a beautiful song, it's one of my favorite songs of all time because it is so hopeful and optimistic. It's one not just about one's desire and wonder about going far away and finding something more and better in life but just simply about the dreams we all constantly hold to get us through a troubled existence.The humor is great and hits at the right moments. One of my favorite humors scenes has been the one with the talking apple trees that complained about their apples being picked. That always cracked me up because of how absurd it truly is.Character are great from the fabulous trio, The Scarecrow, Tin Man, and Cowardly Lion each of them have unique persona and great moments, it's fun when we see them all together and play off of each other much like 'The Three Stooges' well kind of but at least with they have something to strive for which makes them easy to emphasize with and want to win because that's something we all do throughout our lives.The Wicked Witch of the West is a villain played well by Margaret Hamilton, she's a villain you love to hate whom is kind of scary but funny at the same time. It's basically the Wicked Witch archetype but what makes her stand out is in her lines and delivery of them, let alone character whom is just a vanity obsessed jerk that is just tormenting people for no good reason or sick amusement and is obsessed with getting those red slippers just to get more power. Though to me it wasn't so much her that scared me as a kid it was really her minions the flying monkeys, they were just brutes let alone so darn many of them I was afraid they would fly down snatch me away or beat the crap out of me, in one scene they dismembered the scarecrow that's how bad they are.But to me the true heart and soul of the film and story is the character Dorothy Gale whom is my favorite character. Judy Garland is just fantastic this is still my favorite role from her, she is Dorothy Gale just as Christopher Reeve is Superman and any other actor and actress that just fit like a glove for their role. Yeah there have been many other live action versions over the years but she is still the best one in my book. This was also Judy's debut in a main role which in turn helped launch her to stardom, and rightfully so, she really gave it everything she had and delivered. I really love how she has that every day person vibe to her, I thought she was inside and out, it's no surprise I did have a crush on her as a kid.I really love the emotionality on her whenever she expressed sadness it really looked and felt genuine. You really emphasize or can relate to her in some way or another. The fact that she feels she's not where she belongs and dreams of going someplace far and having a better life or at least something more which is understandable I've always felt that way ever since I was a child. I even like that she's open minded and keeps optimistic, hopeful and a positive attitude even in the most difficult circumstances.Other than being a fun adventure, this film does have deep substance a lot of things from the coming of age theme. The Dorothy character is a young teen that is near the verge of young adult hood which is always a time where were thinking about being and entering the adulthood world in some way or form. Dorothy throughout the adventure very much acts like an adult but maintains her innocence which makes her strong not just from getting though circumstances that are difficult or at least look that way at first but the fact she stays true to herself.Which is part of the other theme which is about building identity, each of the three characters The Scarecrow, Tin Man, and Lion all represent personality aspects. They all think they lack something but have always had it all this time, throughout their journey they exercise those aspects. From the Lion whom has as much nervous and frightful energy than Shaggy and Scooby Doo, but he goes on and does the right thing despite what he feels which to me is what true courage really is, and they do say it's only when we feel some fear is when courage comes. And the Scarecrow whom really is exercising smarts from tricking the talking trees into throwing their apples and a plan to infiltrate the castle. But also, it's one Dorothy where throughout the journey she has stayed true to herself which is part of building identity to remember who we are as new things come along in life.But also, what home really is, throughout the journey Dorothy is trying to find her way back home but the thing is even though the beautiful world of Oz isn't her home not is Kansas. She's really thinking about all the people that she left behind in Kansas and how much she is beginning to miss them. And that is truly what home is as an old saying goes 'it's not the place it's the people'. Both Kansas and Oz are her home because there are people in both realms that love her.As long as we keep dreaming, home is never far away.Rating: 4 stars",10,4,4,29 September 2018
Atonement," Lost Romance
","The meaning of atonement is always ones quest for redemption, forgiveness and salvation for others, no matter how long it goers on even a lifetime it is an important mission that must always be complete for the happiness of others as well as ones own.This film is one of the most emotionally moving and tragic film's I've ever seen. Joe Wright whom directed 'Pride and Prejudice' (film I love and previously reviewed) knows how to make a romance film right.The theme in the film is about lost romance. A romance that gets robbed by two people Robie Turner (flawlessly played by James McAvoy) and Cecilia Tallis (Keira Knightly equally brilliant)that obviously deserve and belong to each other, both have done no wrong except love each other. All of this because of one grave misunderstanding by one person Briony Tallis (played at different ages by Saoirse Ronan, Romola Garai, and Vanessa Redgrave) and as we see all three try to reclaim that lost romance, but it is tragically out of reach.One of the brilliant things about this film is how we see the film is broken up into split focus which creates that sense of mystery throughout the film and makes the drama all the more emotional. We get down tot he perspective of Cecilia and Robbie. We just love both of these characters. Cecilia is just a bit stuck up but in a good way, spunky, constantly has criticism that can be a bit unforgiving, but has a sense of warmth to her. Robbie we see is like your usual good guy; he's an underdog, has a dry charismatic charm, a bit on the shy side but never short of courage when it comes to feelings. We can see despite class and character differences their right for one another, and personally I feel that's part of what love is it shouldn't matter who a person is whether in class, race, religion, or any other feature it's the feelings both share for one another that matter. The scenes with them are in a way blissful and beautiful, even the shots of that countryside really reflect the innocence of the romance between the two. The fountain scene we see both are exchanging romantic tension and banter, it seems like arguing Celilia is constantly trying to get a rise out of Robbie while Robbie teases her a bit, it's obviously this interplay has gone on for some time, I can't help but sense Ceilia might have had a crush on him since childhood well that's my theory anyway. We know from the way they look at one another throughout the ordeal that in reality they have deep feelings for one another, once Cecilia is soaked and both look at one another their fate is already sealed. It was also great when we saw another scene with them, when Cecilia got the wrong letter Robbie wrote, Robbie as he's coming to see her tries to apologize it's just funny from how nervous he is. But of course Cecilia does believe him and this leads to a scene I thought was romantic and erotic.It was just sad and unfair when we see their romantic interplay robbed as both get torn away and of course we see both are trying to come back together. From Robbie in the war, resulting in some brilliant shots which add to the emotional weight, one shot which was memorable to me was seeing Robbie go down a bunker and see there is a French romance film playing, he looks at it and of course cries because he feels that Cecilia and their future together after the war could be further out of reach.The of course we would see things unfold in Briony's point of view which as we see is not completely reliable. The truth is presented to us but not the whole truth, because she never sticks around long enough to get all of the facts. Like a fountain scene she mistakenly thinks it's Robbie being rude in a way to her sister, but may'be just a bet if jealously intermixed since Briony herself has a crush on him. Her interpretation of that incident is unreliable because we can't hear anything from where she's positioned plus there is some time that's missing, this weakness of course leads to the downfall in Robbie, Cecilia, and herself, making her feel misery for her own grave sin.What is missing from her point of view makes this all the more sadder because it reflects Briony's life and quest which is incomplete throughout the film. Like when she goes to a wedding, we don't see who they are, most of that wedding we see a shot of how Briony is viewing it, it's a wanting look she wishes this was Cecilia and Robbie's wedding which it really should of been.It all comes down to the final part of the film which always breaks me heart, when we see Vanessa Redgrave's appearance as an elder Briony, I'll just say what she says at the end will haunt you forever.Robbie and Cecilia will live in my heart forever, even I want to believe their romance has returned.Rating: 4 stars",10,1,3,23 June 2012
