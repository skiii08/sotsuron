Requiem for a Dream," Essential viewing
","I first saw this when it was released on DVD when i worked at a video store and i recommended to as many people as i could. A few were amazed and many were shocked.But thats what i love in a film,something moving,gritty,shocking,grimy,confronting,and just plain different from the rest of the garbage out there. I know this has been said but the academy should be very ashamed for not awarding Ellen Burstyn HER Oscar. She was robbed. I only started watching them again this year to see Scorsese receive HIS statues (at last). Burstyns performance was just so heart wrenching I'm still amazed 7yrs later. Jared Leto showed us that he can really act, Jennifer Connelly (when she picks the right roles) can knocked you out and does so here and Marlon Wayons turns out a star making dramatic performance. Christopher Macdonald also deserves a big mention as Tappy Tibbons who i read that a lot of his lines were improvised. Nothing else to say but go watch it!",10,7,13,9 April 2007
Stranger Than Fiction," Very well done!!
","I just had a fantastic time watching this very quiet, beautifully crafted film. Marc Forster has shown us again just how capable a director he truly is. Zach Helms script was a great surprise and left me looking forward to his next film which he is writing and directing. Will Ferrells performance was very well composed and articulate, a complete inspiration as was the wonderfully consistent Emma Thompson. Dustin Hoffman and Queen Latifah felt underused in their roles. But for me Maggie Gyllenhaal was the real standout. She stole every scene and totally lit up the screen every time plus she is absolutely gorgeous. Don't miss this if your after something very different and unconventional",9,1,2,10 May 2007
