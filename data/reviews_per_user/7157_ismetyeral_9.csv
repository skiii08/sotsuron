A Clockwork Orange," PSYCHOTIC MISSION?
","Filmin is the narrator Alex from the beginning to the end. That's why she's seen the audience in the eyes of Alex, who portrays a ruthless, sarcastic, uncommon, offensive, destructive portrait of society's values.Alex DeLarge, who is an antique hero, and his friends are terrorizing the city with a tendency of violence overflowing with the gang they have established. They include milk and drug mix drinks that make violent tendencies in Korova , aged assailants enter the house of a writer named Alexander and injure him and rape the author's wife. Leadership conflicts, which are increasingly intensifying within the gang, end with Alex's friends falling into a trap and going to jail, and things develop.Aside from the violence in prison, Alex behaves obediently, takes care of religion and acquires the priestess sympatia in prison (but identifies himself with the Roman soldiers who tortured him, not Jesus, while reading the Bible).Alex is chosen as a guinea pig for the 'Criminals, Reconciliation and Recruiting' program, which the political party at the head of the country uses to win elections. Alex will be released if the program is successful. The minister gives him political advantage by using Alex to show how he cleans the streets from the blame.
Throughout the program, Alex hands out war and Nazi genocide images in the form of hands, with arms tied, arms wide open, accompanied by Beethoven's 9th symphony. That Beethoven is a unique asset that reflects the only beautiful thing in Alex, that he respects and values. As a matter of fact, Alex's Beethoven busts and drawings in the prison room used Beethoven's music during the Ludovico session, which the minister had not missed. At the end of all this, Alex can not think of applying violence and sexuality. Alex's acts of violence are tried to be prevented by ludovico, a violent action. Alex is released when the program is successful.
When Alex returns home, he sees his family rent a room. His family did not want him, he stayed on the street. The drunk beggar, who had previously been beaten with his gang friends, lynched himself to other beggars and lynched himself. The cops who came to Alex's call for help are his gang friends. Alex is also beating them because their friends are producing violence as police this time. Alex, who managed to get rid of his friends, continues his misfortunes and finds himself at the writer's house he raped his wife. The writer, who does not recognize Alex at first, welcomes him well. But then the writer, who understands who Alex is, takes his wife's revenge by listening to Beethoven, who is conditioned to react to Alex. Alex, who can not tolerate the pain he suffocates, throws himself out of the window and commits suicide.At this point, we need a psychoanalytic termination to better analyze Alex and the society he lives in. The concept that can be brought against crime and punishment in psychoanalysis is ressentiment. Here, in order for ressentiment to be able to be found, a situation of impotence must occur as Alex has experienced. Alex, a man who does not obey / submissive to a repressive social control, resorting to destruction in the name of self-emancipation. So the problem of being present at the root of Alex's violence lies. In such an environment in which the modern state is at a loss to humans, perceiving Alex's acts of violence as an entertainment and pleasure element will be a flawed and incomplete point of view. Even talking in the Russian language of Nadsat, the produce of Alex and his gang friends, is an expression of anti-order tendencies of the efforts to escape from the present.In modern societies, control of vengeance and revenge is possible through punishment. It is worth noting here that state violence is legitimate. In modern states, the use of force has been left out of personality, leaving the state alone. Thus, it is possible to say that power uses it to preserve its continuity, its already existing destructiveness.
State power implements ideal illusion of society through mechanisms such as uniform citizenship. Controls the movement of people by their minds and dominates their lives and asserts those who are contrary to their ideology, the different, or in other words the other, in the direction of their own aims and desires. As a matter of fact, in the film, the system takes the right to choose Alex and transforms it into a machine. Alex's violence has been rehabilitated and eventually Alex has been obliged to comply with the behavior of the community. The torture of Alex tame it, but it is not better or more moral.The concept of violence / violence in the film is also ironic and it is almost possible to see it on the whole of film. This is particularly evident in the scene where writer Alexander initially falls into culpability in his second encounters with caretaker Alex.The concept of violence / violence in the film is also ironic and it is almost possible to see it on the whole of film. This is particularly evident in the scene where writer Alexander initially falls into culpability in his second encounters with caretaker Alex.On the other hand, it is chaotic, the symbols of destruction and the strengthening of the violent bond of the state, when the four inhabitants (Alex and the gang) we are constantly facing throughout the film are sent. Four aggressive and victim motifs, first of all, comes on the stage when Alex and his gang friends are attacking an old beggar. Alex is a victim after four policemen have been beaten in jail. And finally, after leaving prison, the writer's house, the writer, and four people next to him have poured Alex's food, and Alex is still a victim.n connection with the violence, Nazilere is often sent in the film. At the beginning of the film, Alex and the joke are on the stage where they are beaten by other gang members, and the other gang members have Nazi uniforms on them. During the Ludovico treatment, Alex is shown with images of the Nazis. Finally, the uniform and physical image of the prison manager brings Hitler to mind. As is well known, the Nazis have imposed their close tarihe stamps as the most obvious example of the state violence mechanism. It is possible to explain the place of sending the Nazi in the film in this way.At the end of the film, Alex, who is seen in the hospital bed, negotiates with the minister who comes to him. He committed suicide to die, but reborn. This second Alex is different from Alex we know; Alex is now like a minister, a hypocrite. It has become a socialized and orderly puppet. The government, which initially gave Alex a political advantage by reason of purifying the society from criminals, finally uses Alex to smother the streets again. It depends on the fact that the system can survive; violence and crime must not be completely destroyed and control must be in the hands of the system. Otherwise, society will direct this violence to the system itself.As a result, A Clockwork Orange discusses the master-slave dialectic in the context of the mutual processing of crime and punishment in the modern society, and the extent to which the authoritarian punishment method of imposing Alex in the name of ameliorating Alex frees him (!) And whether the freedom of the individual is possible by enslavement of other members of society.",10,3,4,16 August 2018
Raging Bull," Do not get the bull out
","I think that this film is one of the best films of Martin Scorsese and Robet De Niro, and let's not forget Joe Pesci. The factors that made this film so good are the actors and characters at the beginning and the incredible dialogues between the characters make the film both funny and distressing and annoyin",9,2,4,29 June 2018
Heat," Al Pacino? Robert De Niro?
","Written and directed by Michael Mann starring actor Al Pacino, Robert De Niro and Val Kilmer in the starring film. Robert De Niro and Al Pacino are the masterpieces of this film, bringing all the emotions we can live with us through the screenplay of the characters.",10,0,0,1 July 2018
Braveheart," Scottish Spirit
","Braveheart, the 1995 production of Randall Wallece's scriptwriting, the director's chair, and Mel Gibson's lead; he successfully reflected on the epic story of William Wallace, who did not loyal to King I. Edward, stand on the front line of the Scottish freedom struggle, and he won five Oscars that year, including Best Picture. The film, which included a lot of fiction, even though it came from a historical reality, made us feel the last of the scottish people and the wisdom of William Wallace's wrath, hopes and freedom in our pursuit of freedom and invited us to their world and dragged us along with them to search for freedom
It is a film that even preserves its influence in 1995. Mel Gibson is a great example of masterpieces in his companionship. Mel Gibson, who plays both acting and directing roles, has managed to get out of the job very well. Braveheart has been watched for many years in our country with great interest, and has become a focus for the filmmakers. We can call a historical event, a successful expression of your personality, a fuller scenario, a successful production and a master player, as the reason why Braveheart is seen so much around the world.The film is based on the Scottish people's struggle for independence. Mel Gibson has brought William Wallace to character and this character has become a very popular character all over the world. In fact, the life of the film has increased further. Catherine McCurmock in the role of Murron, though rarely seen in the film, has actually been featured in the spectator with pure and clean beauty. This 177-minute film, with the director's editing, has a feature that does not squeeze the viewer at a distance, compared to many other films. I can say Filmin has a lot of improvements.
Filmin Cinematographer John Toll, James Horner, who we know from Tinanic in music, Art Directors were carefully selected and did a great job.

Everyone dies, but not every person really lives.Braveheat (Braveheart) has become a film of freedom and hope. Do not be late anymore if you've been watching this film that's been defying years.",10,1,4,16 August 2018
