Raiders of the Lost Ark," Dear Steven Spielberg, its the boulder.
","Dear Steven Spielberg, Its the Boulder. With mixed emotions I am writing you on behalf of my career. Or should I say, my would have been career. Though I am grateful for the opportunity you gave me as a young, up and coming prop(it had been my dream to work with Harrison Ford since his performance in Apocalypse Now), I have to say the stigma that has haunted me since creates feelings of bitterness toward you and the Indiana Jones franchise. I did not realize how much you villainized me at the time; I am nothing now. Casting me has been impossible. I thought I had arrived with you, my dues paid, and then some.....turn me loose on Hollywood. No one was interested. At first I did not put two and two together. Convinced myself it was the parts that didn't fit. It struck me on the second day of casting for Labyrinth. We were in the final call back for the talking rocks she comes upon. Talking rocks Spielberg. A speaking part. Off camera I heard someone mutter, 'let's hope he doesn't chase us all out of the cave like he did in....' Just like that they took it away from me. No, wait. You took it away. You didn't have your sticky little fingers in that one but you're little partner in crime there Lucas did. I could have been the rock Sloth holds up at the end of Goonies. But wait, who wrote that one? I see everything has worked out for you. Kate Capshaw. Nice. You and this business ground me down to nothing. People hide keys under me now. Sure wish Stanley had stayed around a little longer to finish A.I. for everyone's sake. Yikes. Sincerely, The Boulder",7,0,2,8 August 2009
Alien vs. Predator," Is Predator responsible for Sigourney Weaver's career?
","What we have here is the classic, 'alien civilization (Predator) from another world and time traveling to earth 4000 years ago, enslaving humans (in turn teaching them how to build pyramids spawning the great African, South American, and Asian pyramid empires), and then creating another alien civilization (Alien) so it has something to hunt resulting in a battle for Earth in the present day which takes place below the ice in Antarctica' genre. I know you're thinking, 'A run on sentence and that's all its about? 'Whoever wins, we lose'?' Yes, you do lose. You lose for watching it.However.Once you get through all the atrocious dialog, bad timing, and shoddy (at best) paintings of pyramids 2000 feet below the surface of Antarctica, you get to the meat of AVP. Detach yourself from linear time and step into movie time. This movie is essentially a prequel to the Alien series and establishes their conception as a species. Long story short, Predator creates Alien in a lab (they should have cut to a montage of Predators in lab coats looking down into a beaker with a HR Giger designed clipboard nodding, and maybe sharing a laugh with a strategically placed copy of Richard Connell's short story 'The Most Dangerous Game' in the background all to Herman's Hermit's 'I'm into Something Good'), Alien evolves and flies off into space where thousands of years later it runs into Ripley's crew and ignites Sigourney Weaver's career. I mean before 'Alien' her biggest role was as Woody Allen's date for five seconds in 'Annie Hall'.Does Sigourney Weaver owe Predator her movie career? You be the judge. Does this movie deserve to be ranked a 10 by me? Yes. I mean come on there's almost a make-out scene between Predator and the main actress.'Whoever wins, we lose'? Yeah about an hour and a half of your life but its worth it.",10,3,7,11 March 2005
