The Blair Witch Project," This movie is stupid. Where's the scary part?
","I was expecting an 'Exorcist' of the Nineties from all the hype about this movie. I'm still waiting for an explanation! This was a stupid movie that wasn't scary in the least. The woman has an irritating voice, talks too much, does dumb things like turns on bright lights and yells at night when she should have been hiding in darkness and silence, and expects the audience to believe that she's truly scared out of her wits by something pursuing her but still keeps lugging her camera around and filming the whole thing!",1,0,2,29 August 1999
