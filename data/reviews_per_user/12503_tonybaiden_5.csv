Despicable Me 2," Minion Mania
","Hilarious. I thought the 1st Despicable Me was hard to beat. I was wrong. The film was epic. I loved the opening and how it related to the first film, something was stolen in another country. I thought the film forced the ending and the evil minions were a bit to, maybe insane, but those were maybe the only bad things about it. You could feel Gru's care for the girls, Dr Nefario's plead for evil, but the real stars of the show were the minions (non evil). They cracked me up. Their mischievous mishaps, quarrels and missions lead to mania. I actually thought it was a comedic and family fun version of Mission Impossible. This has to be the best animation I have ever viewed.",7,2,3,19 July 2013
The Avengers," Only 15 wins?
","The best film ever. Mark Ruffalo had some doubts, but he aced Bruce Banner. I mean, the special effects were awesome and I loved the plot. Joss Whedon combined the two best genres: action and comedy and he made an epic movie out of it. The type cast was relatively good. My favourite character has to be Iron Man as of all his gadgets. It was very clever how it began with the Avengers hating one another and then they had to put aside their differences and avenge humanity. In my opinion, the best part was the Battle of New York. I loved how everything flowed from one hero to another. It was action packed and the film had a great climax. It was awesome how in the credits, Thanos revealed himself. A perfect conclusion to Phase One of the saga. I cannot wait for number 2.",10,2,5,30 June 2013
The Incredibles," Incredible!
","This has to be the best film Pixar has ever done. I found it really charming and entertaining to watch.I loved the mix between action, family and comedy. The film had an interesting plot and it was clever how the film flowed. I thought the film began well, but in got way better as it progressed. The characters were awesome, mainly Dash and Frozone. One specific point in the film, when the family needed each other most, that scene unlocked the characters full potential. I enjoyed Jack-Jack fighting Syndrome at the very end, I found that hilarious. What I disliked was that the film took 30 minutes to begin, 60 minutes in the middle, 10 minutes of the end and 10 minutes of credits. There was very little time for the final fight and it was rushed. The Incredibles was a spectacle to watch and one of the best animations ever!",9,0,0,19 July 2013
The Amazing Spider-Man 2," Amazing-ish
","The Amazing Spider-Man 2 is certainly a special film, consisting of magnificent action, spectacular special-effects and amazing performances from the likes of Andrew Garfield, Jamie Foxx and Dane DeHaan, oh, and there certainly is a superior story.I am one who believes Andrew Garfield is a better Spider-Man compared to Tobey Maguire and this film secured my thoughts. Jamie Foxx was a commendable Electro, Emma Stone was the beyond average love interest, but the star of the show was Dane DeHaan's flawless Harry Osborn. All these actors and many more showed the emotional depth the characters needed and embodied the personalities from the comics perfectly.The script and story was the same old Spider-Man formula, only it was told in such a compelling way that it was a film of its own. My only problem with the script refers to Paul Giamatti, whose dialogue felt a bit flat. The pacing of the film was a bit iffy, as if the start was rushed, but it found a suitable speed half-way through.The visuals were flawless, maybe a front-runner for this years VFX Academy Award. It created such a vibrant picture, introducing epic eye- candy.I was not fond of James Horner's score for the first Spidey reboot, but Hans Zimmer, he is the king of film composing. The soundtrack was phenomenal and creates a perfect image of Spider-Man.The Amazing Spider-Man 2 was a nice, visual blockbuster, but had a few issues, so I give it a 7.5/10, behind Spider-Man 2 and The Amazing Spider-Man.",8,10,27,17 April 2014
Thor: The Dark World," Behold the might of Thor! - Spoilers
","What can I say? This film was truly epic. A must watch with phenomenal action sequences and hilarious humour. Positives: 1) Great acting, especially from Tom Hiddleston as Loki, most probably the third best cinematic incarnation of a comic book character, behind Robert Downey Jr's Tony Stark/Iron Man and Hugh Jackman's Wolverine. 2) Just like The Avengers and Iron Man 3, Thor: The Dark World consisted of great humour. 3) CGI. The immense detail used for Asgard, Svartalfheim and so many more locations and objects were incredible! 4) The opening. An awesome flashback of Bor and the Asgardians against Malekith and the Dark Elves. It showed quite a direct narrative in what was happening at the beginning. 5) The ending was exactly what true believers would want. Who would want Loki to die (apart from Erik Selvig and Agent Coulson)? No-one. His apparent death was emotionally meaningful, well to Thor anyway. Before Thor left Asgard to return to Earth, he was telling Odin about Loki's sacrifice and said 'Thank You'. After Thor left, the image of Odin was actually an illusion! Loki lives saying most probably the best line at the end of a movie where Loki says 'No brother, thank you.' 6) Cameos. Stan Lee is back! Excelsior! Te legend of comics, the cameo king, he's back! It was hilarious seeing him back on the big screen as he wasn't in The Wolverine or Iron Man 3, well, he was, only in a deleted scene though. But Stan didn't have the best cameo. Everyone thought we'd see Cap again in Winter Soldier, but no. After freeing Loki from prison, Thor and Loki were headed towards a Dark Elf ship, Loki made Thor look like Sif, then, Loki, unexpectedly made himself look like Captain America! Stars and stripes all the way! 7) Frigga kicking some butt. Maybe the funniest and most shocking fight in the film, Frigga almost defeated Malekith with just two knives! Unfortunately for Thor and Loki and Odin and the Asgardians, Frigga met a tragic end. 8) Thor and Mjolnir. Thor and his hammer are ultra epic. You could see Thor jump off a cliff, flip over, catch Mjolnir and fly! Awesome.Negatives: 1) Malekith. He wasn't a big problem, but he was kind of a one dimensional villain. All he practically wanted was the Aether, a deadly source which inserted itself into Jane Foster. Couldn't Malekith been nice and asked politely for the Aether? Maybe that would've been a bit boring. 2) The intern's intern. That's correct. Jane Foster's intern, annoying Darcy Lewis hired an even more annoying intern who just stood around watching the world erupt into chaos and whacking a dark elf with a car. They could have either got rid of him, or put him to good use. 3) The post-credits scenes. I am super hyped up for Guardian's of the Galaxy and the first of the two post-credits scenes introduced to one of the Guardian's main antagonists. The Collector. He did actually look kind of cheesy with his lamb skin coat and purple minions. Seeing Thanos at the end of the Avengers was amazing. Probably the best post-credits scene ever, especially as the Avengers is my favourite film of all time. Seeing The Collector receive the Aether, an infinity stone, didn't feel right for me. I absolutely love Marvel and Infinity is an epic storyline, so couldn't we see Thanos get the Aether? If they were going the Guardians of the Galaxy way, why couldn't we see Rocket Raccoon or Groot pop up? Post-credits seen 2 was worse. It was 45 seconds and 37 seconds of it was spent with a Thor and Jane having the cheesiest kiss ever and then randomly, a monster pops up in London! I was hoping for an Age of Ultron post-credits scene, but hay, we might see that in Winter Soldier or Guardians.Conclusion: Thor: The Dark World was an awesome film, the third best in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, behind Iron Man 1 and The Avengers. Full of laughs and an overall thrilling action-packed epic. Better than the original with great direction by Alan Taylor. 9/10.",9,3,8,25 November 2013
