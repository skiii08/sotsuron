Hereditary," Empty Of Story & Meaning
","Full of Metaphors which seems attractive in the beginning but after 30 minutes you wonder all this nonsense in about!
Consider this a 2 hours total waste of you time and or in the end you will be surprised by this total meaningless scenes ...Ari Aster just like in Midsommar doesn't know what he wants. I believe he just write down his illusions and then over night decide to direct them as well!Totally brilliant in reverse form !!!

300," Mr. Snyder & Great visual effects VS real history !!!???
","I have watched this movie and with no doubt its effects blows your mind, behold your eyes and makes everybody standing ovations at the end of the movie. (as some other viewers mentioned).But if you have just know a little bit of historical events and reality that what really happened (according to most myths and written documents) then you just admire this movie for its visual & sound effects and not for the very badly needed elements of a good movie which are story (at least softly touching facts) and actors inseparable feel in their roles (like what we saw in LOTRs trilogy).I am sure every script writer specially the ones who like to write their own, based on history or a novel should do some research or read the novel as many times as needed to create something outstanding weighing almost the same as the original one. I think Mr. Snyder has forgot to do so as Mr. David Franzoni in Gladiator or Fran Walsh in LOTRs. I don't recommend to go watching this movie willingly unless you are so in love with EFFECTS like an action game fan. But you may want to decide for yourself and see the GLORY is STILL for Maximus the anonymous Gladiator.3/4 out of 10 just for its fantastic effects.",1,10,21,13 March 2007
