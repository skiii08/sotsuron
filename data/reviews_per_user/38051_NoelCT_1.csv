The Incredible Hulk," Not great, but good enough for a fun time.
","You all know the plot: Dr. Bruce Banner is exposed to gamma radiation which turns him into a raging monster in times of emotional distress. The origin was already covered in Ang Lee's 2003 version, so this sorta-sequel sorta-reboot picks up with Bruce in hiding as the government continues its search. The two end up colliding when Bruce sets out to find a cure.It's a shame Edward Norton might not be back for another, because I really like what he's done with the role. He really captures the tragic plight of Bruce's dilemma, constantly on the run from others, but unable to escape the demons within. And there's some wonderful, logical additions in the form of breathing techniques and a simple pulse counter that grounds the character in reality.And when the beast comes out, wow. This rippling mass of fury feels as real a Hulk as we'll ever get when he lets out a Lou Ferrigno-voiced roar and tosses a boulder to the raining heavens. My only gripe is that they dropped his miles-wide leaps in favor of superpowered free-running. The sight of him hopping from rooftop to rooftop made a little girl in the theater laugh, 'It's just like Spider-Man!' In terms of the again revised origin, I'm satisfied. Yes, I'd still like to see Banner silhouetted in front of a gamma mushroom cloud, but at least they found a nice way to use the version from the old TV series while slipping in some additional history that ties into the developing Marvel Film Universe.There was nearly unanimous condemnation from critics of Liv Tyler's whispery performance as Betty Ross, Bruce's former love, but I didn't mind. She wasn't excellent, but she ably brought to life a woman gentle enough to sooth a raging monster, yet strong enough to stand toe-to-toe with some of the most aggressive military men on film. I read that Tyler and Norton did a lot of prep work on their characters' relationship, and it shows because Betty and Bruce are so visibly, beautifully, agonizingly in love, yet circumstances just won't let them be.It terms of what I don't like, the major element is the portrayal of General 'Thunderbolt' Ross. It's a shame, because it is one of the most animated and memorable performances I've seen from William Hurt, but I really think the changes made to the character upset the fantastic dynamic offered by the comics. There, Ross was willing to do everything in his power to destroy the Hulk, which he sees as a chaotic threat to all of humanity. Everything, but use his daughter, Betty. His fear for her safety blinds him to the fact that she is the only hope of quelling the beast, which causes Ross to take devastating situations to extreme lengths that should have been avoided. In the film, Ross doesn't fear the Hulk, he wants to control it, harness it for the use of the government, and he'll do everything in his power to achieve his goals. Even exploit Betty.Does my displeasure make sense? Not only did they upset a nice dynamic, but took an iconic supporting character and threw a complete 180 on his portrayal. Now, I can understand the need for such a threat, because it gives a reason for Bruce to keep himself out of their hands, but isn't that what Dr. Samuel Sterns is for? Sterns, in a gloriously wacky performance by Tim Blake Nelson, is a reckless scientist obsessed with the broad potential offered by gamma radiation. All they needed to do was boost his role so he, Blonsky, and Ross form a trifecta of antagonists in constant pursuit of our hero. One wants to posses the power, one wants to exploit the power, and one wants to destroy the power. Sadly, Sterns and his interests are tucked away in the final half-hour where they have little impact on the broader story beyond setting up the final fight.And then there's Emil Blonsky. If they'd gone with the dynamic I mentioned a paragraph ago, then he would have fit perfectly into the picture. As it is, Blonsky is shoehorned into the script for no other reason than to create another monster for the Hulk to have a throw-down with. In terms of execution, I can't help but think it would have worked better if Tim Roth played him as a good, dedicated soldier slowly corrupted by the thirst for more power. Instead, he's a wolfish, sneering rogue who wants to take on the Hulk just because it'll make him feel like more of a man.In terms of other problems, all I can think of is my regret that the scene between Leonard Samson (the always reliable Ty Burrell) and Bruce was cut because it was such a fantastic exploration of the Bruce/Betty relationship. Otherwise, this was a damn exciting, thoughtful superhero movie that, while not perfect, does show the continuing improvement of quality in the overall genre.",7,1,2,18 October 2010
