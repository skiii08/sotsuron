Hereditary," Horrid movie experience
","Hands down most disappointing movie experience in years. Poor character development, a family dog that 'appears' midway through the film then disappears, characters crawling on ceilings and meaningless plot twists.
Toni Collette's career as a crafts and arts figurine painter doesn't even make sense in the context of the story.
Inexplicable resolution followed by a more puzzling Joni Mitchell track for end credits.
Disappointed. Unsatisfied. Shocked at the level of subpar filmmaking. This cannot even be salvaged.",1,5,10,2 December 2018
