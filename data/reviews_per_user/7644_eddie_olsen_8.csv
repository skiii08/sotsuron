Vertigo," My favorite Hitchcock
","What a movie! Like the other Hichcock classics made around this time the atmosphere is so evoking. It is difficult to determine how he accomplish this. It's probably the mix of a unique story and clever lines.You need exceptional acting to deliver these dialoges. And both James Steward and Kim Novak does it with perfection. Not to say that the film is especially talky. There are also scenes where Hichcock uses silence to make the film a puzzling mystery. Especially the scenes where Madeleine Elster is sitting lost in her own thoughts.As in many other of his films the female character suffers from a bizarre obsession. Hichcock is THE master of portraying extreme personalities in a believable way. The reason is probably that he also show their more normal and rational side. The frustration of falling in love with the wrong person is a central theme in the story. The theme is common, but is given a unique and refreshing treatment.The suspense is pure miracle! Highly recommended.",10,3,8,18 October 2009
The Godfather: Part II," Was this sequel really necessary?
","Yes, it was.Coppola recently stated that part II and III shouldn't be made. I can agree with the latter. But part II is good. The thing impressing me most is how Coppola manages to make it look like the 50's/60's. Like a time machine! I owned this film on VHS and have seen it several times. The intertwined time line is genius. All actors do a good job and particularly de Niro.This film is slow. Very slow. 200 minutes in a steady pace. Thus, many viewers will fall out from time to time. This makes it difficult to follow the complex story. Unlike part I it's sequel also suffers from not having any dramatic highs and lows. The film balance on the edge between unmatched drama and boredom.But it's production, acting and realistic presentation of the period is more than enough to give it a good rating. The film will get better the second and third time you watch it.",8,0,2,7 June 2009
Lawrence of Arabia," Historical epic of all time!
","In the years of the big historical epic films, from 1957-1964, some of the most spectacular and costly films in Hollywood history were made. The creators lay much effort in an accurate depiction of the time the film was set in. A large fraction of those films where set in the Roman empire. These films, with standard features like a horse race, a gladiator combat, etc. have grown out of favor (not me!).The most of 'Lawrence of Arabia' is set in the desert, avoiding the extravagance of Roman empire epics. There is no shining marble here. When Lawrence is asked 'What is it that you find so fascinating about the desert?', he answers 'It's clean'. The sand dunes make a clean and yet exotic backdrop to the drama. This is one of the reasons why 'Lawrence of Arabia' doesn't look dated.By any measure, the acting of Peter O'Toole is superb. His somewhat twisted and high tempered acting fits like a glove. Who can imagine any other playing the Godfather than Marlon Brando? Same thing here. Alec Guiness, Anthony Quinn, Jack Hawkins....who can ask for more? And of course, there is no real epic from the desert without Omar Sharif. The entire cast is rock solid! However, this is the early 60's and the movie screen was very much a theater stage in contrast to films today where the acting melts more seamlessly into the action. This may be a barrier for some.'Lawrence of Arabia' is a full night's entertainment, almost 4 hours. I love it! The story is told in a continuous time line with no flashbacks or side stories. To make a 4 hrs straight time line drama work is hard, but done right it's pure joy to watch. There is a climax every 30-45 minutes and the timing of the highs and lows are perfect.Most people will recognize the orchestral music after three tones. Avoiding fanfares and other features so typical for Roman epics, the music is grand and sweeping, but never boring. The main theme is developed through the film in various ways. Bits of oriental tunes adds the right atmosphere.Historical epics are not for everyone. 'Lawrence of Arabia' will surprise many new viewers because it doesn't fall into the same category as Ben-Hur, Spartacus and Cleopatra. If the age of the film is not an issue for you, it's a must see.",10,1,3,9 June 2009
The Dark Knight," Two hours of pure action
","In my opinion films on the Top 250 films list mostly fall into two categories: 1) films considered as classics and 2) big budget films released after IMDb was established as THE movie web page. The Dark Knight falls into the latter.The film follows the model of an over-the-top Hollywood action film. A film must be judged by how close it comes to the genre's ultimate goal (or in some cases that it's impossible to put it into any category at all). Action films do not give your life a new meaning, but is pure entertainment.It is here I find the strength of the film. The action scenes are spectacular. One thing I particularly like is that most of the scenes are 'real' and not computer animated. I was a big fan of films like Lord of the Rings, but grew increasingly tired of watching films as life like as Toy Story. Yes, disagree with me, but the graphics of even the best fantasy film is blurry on the edges and the lighting looks like what you see in a mode magazine.There is said much about the performance of Heath Ledger. He deserves it. Gary Oldman is in my opinion the best actor in the cast. Not exactly the heroic type and gives the film a human touch.",9,0,3,7 June 2009
2001: A Space Odyssey," 1968: the year when sci-fi got interesting
","In the history of sci-fi films there are hardly a handful that go down in history as serious or important. 2001: A Space Odyssey is unsurpassed in both departments.Most important: where most films communicate their message through the dialogues and the story, 2001 works on a conceptual level. What makes this film really unique is that Kubrick leaves few clues to what this concept is which makes it impossible to form a clearly defined interpretation. Is the concept intelligence? Or the past and future of human kind? Or has it a religious message? There are NO answers...I remember watching it for the first time...and the second time the day after. What was this REALLY about? Browsing the internet for explanations. I read many theories, but none that was more plausible than the other.Just one time I got this feeling again, when I looked up on the pyramids in Egypt. What on earth IS IT? It's both frustrating and a pleasing at the same time. A kind of religious feeling.The sound plays an important role in the film. The music is partly classical, partly avant-garde. There are many scenes where breathing or distant sounds from animals make up the sound stage.Like other Kubrick films the story is told in 'chapters'. The story is nonetheless easy to follow.A sci-fi movie can't be reviewed without mentioning the special effects. A sci-fi made in 1968 will make most people think of flying saucers and silly costumes. 2001 does not look dated. The special effects are very much the same as those in Star Wars. It looks more realistic than Star Wars episode IV but not as astonishing as episode V.This is not a film for everybody. In the same time you do not have to like sci-fi to love this film.",10,0,4,8 June 2009
The Shawshank Redemption," An interesting film
","Both the story and acting is very good. Though not provoking, the film doesn't stop when the credits starts rolling. It will make you think.This film slowly takes off and has no really element of suspense. It's a human story without any fast action. The production contains no surprises and make the viewer concentrate 100% on the story....but my single issue is how long it takes for the film to get interesting. For me almost an hour. Maybe this is necessary to build up the story. A high rated film needs to be great from the start. The first part is a film true to it's genre and quite predictable.I can's stop thinking that this film's outstanding rating on IMDb, like some others, maintain their position of obvious reasons. When a film (or music album)is considered among the best, new reviewers are affected by this status.",7,0,1,7 June 2009
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Fantasy is not my cup of tea
","I have problems appreciating this film.All that weeping! I can't remember crying so much when I was a teenager. Nor did I call my friends Mr. this and that. Where did Sam get that from? Tolkien seems to be inspired by sagas like the Norwegian Viking sagas (Snorre's Kongesagaer) I read at school. These sagas tell the tale of brave kings and not of depressed and psychological unbalanced kids.As mentioned in one of my other reviews, I have grown tired of computer animations. I found it interesting in 2003, but my fascination has somewhat faded over the past years.I have no problem understanding teenagers fascination with this film. Star Wars was a big thing in my youth. Maybe this film wasn't meant for me...",4,3,8,7 June 2009
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," The best Star Wars episode, but why Mark Hamill?
","This film was a part of my childhood. Therefore, it is especially difficult for me to review it.Most people on IMDb have seen this film and are therefore familiar with the story. Episode V is the darkest in the classic trilogy. I also mean this literally. But most important, this film focus more on Dart Vader, the ruler of the galaxy, than the other films. He is the dark knight slaughtering everyone who gets in his way.The pace is, like all Lucas films, very fast. That is a good thing. After all, there is no food for thought here. Even an eight year old will not miss any messages hidden between the lines.Casting has never been Lucas's strong side. Harrison Ford is the big exception here. He fits the role as the rough guy who ended up supporting the good side seemingly by chance. His temper, barefaced lines and selfishness prevents our heroes from appearing dull.Dart Vader is a symbiosis of David Prowse doing the physical acting and James Earl Jones speaking the lines. I wouldn't call the physical acting difficult, but David does his job. The latter person's deep voice is ideal for the dark knight.Alec Guiness appears just a couple of minutes in the film. As always his acting is flawless.The rest of the cast is a mixed bag. Mark Hamill looked like a good choice in episode IV when he was a rookie in the space war business. In episode V he just don't manage to depict the main character as a confident jedi knight.Carrie Fischer as Princess Leia and Billy Dee Williams as Lando act with no credibility. Jeremy Bulloch depicts the ultra cool bounty hunter Boba Fett nicely, but like Dart Vader it is not the hardest thing to do.How can I give the film 9 points after these harsh comments? This is sci-fi. Who expects deep meaning, memorable acting or complex drama? Most people are more interested in high production values. Episode V was by 1980 the best produced film ever. To make space ships, lasers, futuristic building structures and numerous creatures look natural is a challenge even today. Star Wars episode V is far beyond Alien, 2001, Star Trek, Close Encounters, etc.The film won an Academy Award for Best Sound. How does a space ship sound? You'll find the answer in this film.Last but not least, the sound track is great. Like a Wagner opera each character is given a theme. The effect is fascinating. John Williams won international acclaim with the score and it is the only classical sound track music album which went gold until decades later. With Star Wars John Williams created the template for all sci-fi and fantasy film scores.All in all: this is good entertainment. But if you except drama look elsewhere.",9,0,2,9 June 2009
