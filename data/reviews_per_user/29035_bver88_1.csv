Walk the Line," the beat goes on
","Excellent music bio..... the 50's and 60's re created ...I was there and I remember them...the times they were a changin'...loved the Dylan references,the Elvis, Jerry Lee et al cameos... costuming and sound are exceptional as are the performances, both musical and dramatic... the throbbing hypnotic 'beat goes on' as opening scenes unfold. Johnny awaits his entrance to the Fulsom Prison concert in 1968 and casts his memory back to his early days....wonderful stuff... casting was thoughtfully and beautiful done...all so perfectly believable...I got caught up in the mood and didn't want the film to end...which it does...suddenly...after 145 minutes even! I want MORE..felt like calling for an encore..but the film credits were rolling to the beat of THAT throbbing wondrous guitar and THAT voice.. highest kudos to the filmmakers.. bravissimo! It's 2012: subsequent viewings confirm for me. It's VERy good & still a '9'. Casting is spot on. Music fresh. Catches the era perfectly for me.",9,0,1,23 March 2006
