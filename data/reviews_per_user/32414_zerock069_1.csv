The Avengers," A good start for a journey
","Im writing this because my profile checklist needs this.. Sorry. Good movie by the way. full of humour, thrills and a great cast of characters, all of which impel this visual effects-driven spectacle. Whilst I had the great opportunity to watch this epic in the cinema in. ,got to shine and the story accommodated them all perfectly. What I loved is that Marvel did it again with their main villain. Loki was just so wonderful and complex in this amazing movie. Spurned Loki masterfully dances on the fault lines of villainy and redemption. He always keep people guessing and. Again, another wonderful aspect of this spectacular movie .",Null,0,1,6 June 2016
