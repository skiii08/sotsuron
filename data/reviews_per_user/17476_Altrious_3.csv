Resident Evil: Afterlife," May be for you, but not for me.
","I am truly not a fan of these movies. I have always loved the Resident Evil franchise, and that is why I still see these movies. None of that have been good by movie standards, none of them have been good by fanboy standards. Resident Evil is one of the only things I have ever really been a fanboy of. And, of course, fanboys are never pleased. That's just what it is. The games have even been steadily declining. The movies are just plain awful. I won't lie, the first movie wasn't too bad. It was alright because it was general. They made a new story line and were going with it. Cool. But then, they started to try to intertwine the game stories and the movie's story, and it just makes no damn sense. There are two kinds of people who like the RE franchise. Those who like the games and movies because it's about zombies, and that's enough for you. Cool, it's general, there's zombies, and there's blood. Awesome. But, I am a fan of the franchise because of it's in-depth storyline, and its character development. And the movies have none of that. And, putting aside the fact that this is a remake of a video game, it was just a bad movie in general. It was short, I couldn't find a real storyline, and there was way to much slow motion. And hell, the antagonist was in only two scenes of the movie. That's just unacceptable.",4,6,14,11 September 2010
Kick-Ass," Loved it
","I won't go as far to say this is the best movie of all time. But, after seeing the garbage that was Clash of the Titans before this in theaters, it feels like it could be considered the best. But, that's a different movie, so, different review. I did enjoy this movie thoroughly. Of course it had its downsides, but what movie doesn't? I see so many complaints about Chloe as Hit-Girl, and all I can do is praise her. Children tend to ruin movies for me, but, this was not that case. This movie was brilliant because of her. The amount of seriousness mixed with childishness was hilarious and entertaining as hell. Nicholas Cage, I will honestly say, every movie I have ever seen him in, I have no enjoyed. Movies such as, Ghost Rider, National Treasure, The Wicker Man, all these movies made me want to cry. But, in Kick Ass, I couldn't help but love him. He felt so cheesy and dumb, but, that's the kind of movie this is. He was a stereotype that people have seem to have forgotten, and he played it beautifully and he had me laughing whenever he was on screen. And not to mention, his action scene was pretty bad ass. Christopher Mintz-Plasse, I'm not a huge fan of. Superbad was a rather awful movie, and he didn't make me go crazy in this film. Something about this guy just makes me hate, it's probably his voice, and the goofy look that is ever present on his face. He could have easily been left out of this movie for all I cared.Aaron Johnson I think I will look forward to in the future. I liked the way he did the roll in this, his voice got a bit old and he seemed to be trying far to hard to have a geeky attitude, when we knew it was there. Overall, I enjoyed the hell out of this movie. It was funny, the action was good, and the story wasn't God awful. It didn't take itself too seriously, but when it did, it did it well.",8,8,21,22 April 2010
Clash of the Titans," I almost cried.
","I honestly don't think I could put in to words how excited I was to see this movie. And now, I honestly don't think I could put in to many words how much I hated this movie. I almost feel it would be appropriate to just copy and paste the word 'GARBAGE' over and over again, it would probably be an accurate review. About half way through the movie, I realized nothing was even in 3D anymore, so, I just removed my glasses and held back the urge to leave the theater. The only reason I didn't leave, it because I was with a group of people, and I drove everyone. If that hadn't been the circumstance, I wouldn't have seen the ending of this movie.The action was awful, and almost non-existent. The characters were boring. The Dialogue felt like it was written by a 12 year old. And the plot didn't make much sense at all. And my main complaint about this movie. After about an hour, we have about 7 'developed' characters. They go to fight Medusa and on their way, pretty much say 'How are we going to get back after this?'. They 'fight' Medusa for about 5 minutes, and everyone, literally every character, dies. Except Perseus, of course. Then, he just magically appears back on Earth, with no explanation of how he got out of Hades, just to watch his immortal girl friend die. But, fret not, she is magically resurrected at the end of the film, even though she was supposedly cursed by the gods.",2,7,11,22 April 2010
