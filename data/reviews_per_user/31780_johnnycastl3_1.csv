Ghost," A love story between realms
","One of the greatest love stories ever told with all the right ingredients of a successful title. Romance, mystery, heartache, unsuspected friendship, betrayal and revenge, all perfectly encapsulated in one gorgeous story.We have a young Molly Jensen (Demi Moore) and the ghost of Sam Wheat (Patrick Swayze), her murdered lover. Sam tries to save Molly from dire circumstance with the help of the hesitant Oda Mae Brown (Whoopi Goldberg), a gifted psychic.The majority of the film's great success is owed to the magnificent and electric on-screen chemistry created between Swayze and Moore as the two torn lovers. Their connection is truly believable, and with the support of one of the grandest love songs of all time, 'Unchained Melody' by The Righteous Brothers, you can't go wrong.Whoopi Goldberg's Oda Mae Brown is everything you would expect of an eccentric swindler come psychic, and makes for good humor amidst the turmoil.'Loney rivers flow, to the sea, to the sea... I'll be coming home, wait for me.' -Hy ZaretA fantastic watch if you like to be swept away and enchanted, but kept on the edge of your seat. A must-see film.",10,1,1,4 January 2014
