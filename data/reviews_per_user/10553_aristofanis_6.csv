Raiders of the Lost Ark," yes, movies can be better than this
","A brave American archaeologist defies, almost singlehandedly, Nazis, Arabs and a sleazy Canadian in an ongoing pursuit filled with gunshots, explosions and fist fighting in order to bring to the safe hands of the US academia a significant relic of the Hebrews. Apart from the political undertones, there are way too many predictable things happening in this movie as the 'good' guys win over the 'bad'. Seeing this movie at the age of 7 must be exhilarating. Seeing it at the age of 14 must be quite fun. But if you are any older than that, most scenes will seem redundant. I believe that most viewers' ecstasy with this movie stems from their nostalgia to when they first saw it and that's legitimate.",6,3,9,30 May 2008
Forrest Gump," Naive or underlying irony?
",This movie was pleasant to watch although as it progressed towards the end it became more and more cheesy. Can Forrest Gump be a grotesque caricature of the average ignorant and politically numb citizen that sees history passing in front of his eyes without noticing it? Is the country he lives in made for idiots? I liked the return from Vietnam and the scenes with the lieutenant. I didn't like the philosophical contemplations made by Gump as he becomes 'wise' nor the way the movie concludes with the unnecessary death of Jenny which leaves Forrest raise his child that in turn doesn't seem to have any particular problems with that. The heroics towards the end are also incredibly far fetched. Overall it is a fun movie with some good moments but I wouldn't take it too seriously.,7,0,2,14 July 2006
"Good Morning, Vietnam"," Robin Williams tries to save the day...
","Robin Williams turns this mediocre story into a one man show. Still, the laughs yielded here are far less than if there hadn't been such an emphasis on how funny he is... Laughter cannot come out forcefully. The anti-war messages in this movie aren't enough to deviate from a sublime American propaganda. When Robin Williams demands censorship-free news like back home he gets 'this is not America' as an answer. It is implied by both that such things never happen in the States. Not to mention that the information censored was never about doubting the war but facts that would possibly hamper the army's moral. When the Vietnamese boy expresses the agony of his people, the 'anti-war' DJ exclaims 'we are only here to help'! Any sentimental attachment Williams had with the locals seems to be in the realm of joke. Even his little affair with the young girl doesn't seem to overshadow him a bit. At the same time he is very convincing when saluting the U.S. soldiers. He also feels pity for the pick-up bar ran by a perversive underworld local.... Excessive coarse jokes also spoil some possibilities for humor. Silence is funnier sometimes. 6/10",7,1,3,17 July 2006
Grease," reflected an era
","I grew up listening to this film's soundtrack and observing pictures from the movie. Later, when my parents let me see it, it did not live up to the expectations my childish imagination had set. Twenty five years later, I realize that the music and some of the dancing is what salvages this somewhat dumb scenario.  The film is a compact package of images and archetypes of a certain US culture  (50s mixed with some 60s and 70s in them). Cars, leather jackets, american sports, american fast food restaurants, american high schools, competitiveness... He/she who has more of all this is the winner.  Typical of this agenda is when Sandy sings near the end 'Look at me I'm Sandra-dee' as a mourning of an identity she has to give up.  She will be rewarded when she uglyfies herself proving that she is capable in conforming.  Danny also has to prove himself. One wonders what could had happened had they had not done otherwise! Like in most simplistic movies, there are good and bad guys and complicated teenage situations such as pregnancy are dealt with superficially simplistic solutions. Not to be taken seriously. 6/10 for its musical aspects and for my admiration to Olivia Newton John.",8,0,4,7 January 2004
City of God," film craftsmanship!
","This isn't an easy subject matter to make a masterpiece out of it, but Meirelles has done it! This story is told in the most skilful of ways! All its bits and pieces are carefully placed and events are uncovered with flashbacks then when they really matter most! Innovating filmmaking molds the scenes and the acting is flawless. Yes, it is perhaps one of the most violent films I've seen but I don't think it is for the sake of spectacle or that it is a cold portrayal of gangs in Rio.  This is a film with a striking social commentary. It exposes all levels and aspects of poverty and social inequalities in Rio and strikes us with the sheer magnitude of a problem that is real and ongoing! We see the fatalism of the ghetto, the corruption of the police, a society that never rewards good faith, the indifference of the system to intervene ('let them kill themselves' says the policeman), a system that supports the erosion and the self destruction of the masses. The protagonist is too human. He is the link between us and the jungle. The whole story is about a deep helplessness! Even 'bad' Ze is really a helpless figure.  Allow me to say that I think that movies like 'The Lord of the Rings' is more violent in essence. 9/10 No doubt the best movie of the year.",10,0,2,18 February 2003
Avatar," History repeats itself
","This movie has been praised for its graphics and at some instances criticized for its plot. I have not watched Pocahontas but I do believe that many of the main ideas have been repeated in the past. To me this isn't necessarily a flaw. History repeats itself and just as we haven't learned from our past crimes we do not seem to be learning from our current ones either. So I think Cameron tries to make some crucial points clear for once more to a wide pop-corn audience which expects mainly visual sensations.Expressions used in this film such as 'Shock and Awe' and 'Terror' reveal, even to the unsuspected, the parallels drawn here with current irrational warfare mostly for the control of markets and resources.There is a strong environmental agenda and ultimately there is revolution. The messages are clear and relevant. Yet they may fall short in being convincing. The natives bear too many cultural similarities to humans. They speak in polysyllabic words, are monogamous, use similar tools, gather and sing to evoke something spiritual, the women's concept of femininity is similar to ours etcÂ… Of course all this is done in order for us to relate to them as much as possible.Some cheesy disneyish romance, along with romantic views on natives that look like North American Natives and sing to African tunes, make also part of the Hollywood gloss.What chiefly kept me interested was the ongoing switching of the marine's world from that of the artificial human environment to the natural non-human one. It is within those transformations that his dilemmas are understood and his character develops.Overall, it was an entertaining experience with beautiful imagery and pertinent messages. There is room for more character development and intricacy, especially from the part of the natives.",8,0,1,14 January 2010
