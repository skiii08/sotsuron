Iron Man 3," Good, could have been better!
","After watching the first Iron Man, I was very impressed, however I did not watch the second one and so the storyline to Iron Man 3 did not make much sense to me. The film had a budget of $200,000,000 and made $174,144,585 in just the opening weekend in the USA.The film is about Tony Stark trying to find the Mandarin (played by Sir Ben Kingsley), however, things seem to take a turn when he discovers that the man that was seen as the Mandarin was only a decoy. This is where the film really starts, most of the action and fight scenes happen after this as Tony is looking for the Mandarin. During all of this, Pepper gets taken by the real Mandarin, which causes a lot of conflict in the film. The ending of the film was a real surprise, Pepper killed the Mandarin, her character had been pretty quiet during the rest of the film, then this ending happens and it is almost shocking.Iron Man 3, unlike the others, contains a lot of humour which makes the film more enjoyable. However, the fact that the film is so long did make a lot of people think that it was a bit rubbish and didn't need it all. Also, some people think that the twist with the Mandarin ruined the film, as it was a bit stupid that he was only a decoy after everything that had happened, some people believe this made it better.I think this film was an improvement from the first one due to the use of humour in the film, it made it a lot better to watch. However, I do prefer the first Iron Man, it was a lot simpler and was easy to follow all the way through, unlike Iron Man 3 that has a lot of twists and turns. I feel the Iron Man films have hit a dead end now, there is nothing more they could do to make a new film, it wouldn't make any money as people have already lost interest.",6,1,2,2 October 2013
The Conjuring," A good film with very few criticisms
","The Conjuring had a budget of $20 million, this is quite a low budget for such a successful horror film. One reason this film became so popular because it was directed by James Wan, a well-known director of 'Saw' and 'Insidious' also the film was distributed by Warner Bros making it more successful because of its popularity. The Conjuring took 20 years to develop due to it being based on a true story, the element of it being based on a true story made it even more successful because true story films are becoming increasingly popular.My view on the film is mostly positive, I found that the jumpy elements of the film and the music is what made this film a horror. Although there has been a lot of 'paranormal' type films, this one stood out as the story was based on a real family, which are in the featurette 'The Devils Hour'. However, I disliked this film because I found that towards the end it became too alike 'Paranormal Activity' which made it seem almost fake.Overall I think this film did well, it stands out from other horror films and has become a huge success, I think the sequels will do well.",8,2,3,27 January 2014
