The Blair Witch Project," This is a smart movie?
","After reading several comments by reviewers, it seems those who think TBWP is an intellegent movie.  I disagree.  First off John Hopkins school did a study where they took an English class and asked them to watch TBWP.  The people who liked this movie did worse in the class then those who liked it.And as we continue I might point out that this movie has the worst dialogue ever put together in movie history and the actors in this movie make the acting on the soap operas seem like Spencer Tracy.  One of the worst movies ever.  Even worse than its 99 partner in bad horror movies The Haunting.",1,8,15,19 November 2002
Independence Day," One of the most underrated movies of the last 10 years
","When I first saw ID4 in the theater, I thought it was an OK movie.  However after recently catching it on television I must confess I thought it was an excellent movie.  Despite what critics say the characters are well developed, and we the audience do care about their fate.  This movie has it all: romance, action, humor, drama.  While some may complain about parts of the dialogue being cliche, I believe that would take something away from this film.  If only The Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones could have taken a lesson from this movie.***1/2 out of ****",9,1,2,10 July 2002
The Deer Hunter," The best war movie ever made
","The Deer Hunter is one of the best movies I have ever seen.  This movie has some of the most powerful scenes ever filmed.  It is also well acted.  I won't spoil the rest for you, just go out and rent it.  You'll be glad you did.",Null,0,0,15 September 2003
Born on the Fourth of July," Makes you think
","This movie is an under appreciated masterpiece.  You may not agree with its message, but it is a powerful story.  I wish that people like Bush and those in Congress watch it before they decide to attack Iraq.  And don't accuse me of being liberal, I am a South Park Republican.",Null,0,3,28 December 2002
