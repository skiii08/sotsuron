The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," Bloody Good
","I personally think this was a major step up from the other movies, It was beautifully done. If you're looking for something 'better' well then I'm sorry but that's impossible. This movie was Gross, Romantic, Action packed,funny, etc.I missed the cast, I missed getting excited about Twilight and this just brought every emotion back. This was very impressive. The characters all matured, it was very convincing and frankly Twilight was never meant to be a normal vampire film, its different. Its risky, I'm glad Steph decided on Vampire/demon kids, 'sparkling' vamps because its unique not dumb. Maybe people nowadays still aren't into change.",10,4,15,30 November 2011
