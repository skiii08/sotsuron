Skyfall," I Gave Up!
","Not to say that all Bond films aren't very far-fetched but this one insults the intelligence of anyone who ever bought a movie ticket! That is unless 007 has shifted from the thriller genre to the fantasy one and I missed it.The first fifteen minutes were SO ridiculous that I couldn't be bothered watching any more. We start with a high-speed vehicle chase through over-crowded streets (although no one is visibly killed and then on motorcycles across rooves (funny how all those rooves were built to withstand the weight of speeding motorcycles landing on them after jumping from other buildings). Then the chase continues off the side of a railway bridge and, (guess what?) BOTH parties successfully land on the moving train which, as well as being a passenger train, also has a huge excavator on board which (more guess what?) is fueled up and ready to go - not chained down or secured at all!Then the antagonist is able to shoot the couplings of a train apart (yes, that's the couplings capable of pulling a that multi-tonne digger) and yet the train keeps right on rolling with the vacuum or air brake lines broken and the driver obviously has no idea that he's lost half his train. But then, shortly afterward, the train comes to a tunnel that the excavator would never have got through so perhaps the driver was expecting to lose it anyway!Eventually the girl, who is able to keep pace with the train in a Land Rover runs out of road but is gifted with a clear shot of Bond and his adversary fighting on the roof of the moving train - except that she is scared of hitting the wrong guy. However, M (who is also in full voice contact with everyone except the bad guy) tells her to take the shot anyway which she does and, of course, Bond falls from the roof of the train. But (yet another guess what) the train happens to be on a viaduct at some dizzying height above a fast-flowing river into which Bond falls. Meanwhile, Bond's girl accomplice is left with a wonderful clear shot of the bad guy for several seconds before the train disappears into a tunnel but (last guess what) - she doesn't take it!And that's when I left! What a load of garbage!!",4,3,9,7 November 2015
The Hunger Games," Wow!
","My title sums this movie up. I haven't read the books but I notice from other reviewers who have that the film is an excellent graphic portrayal of the original work of fiction so I will accept that as fact.The story is bizarre in that a nation could tolerate such a barbaric pseudo-entertainment for 74 years without someone putting a stop to it but then this is fiction! The change to the rules after 74 years is, to say the least, fortunate - particularly for Peeta (Josh Hutcherson).Again, another reviewer said that Panem is supposed to be a futuristic version of the USA and that didn't surprise me at all. The CIA has been manipulating both domestic and international affairs for decades and so the manipulation of what is supposed to be a straightforward competition didn't surprise me one bit. Unfortunately for them though, Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence) was just that bit too smart for them - even right at the very end.All the actors played their roles excellently although probably the most experienced of them all, Donald Sutherland was, I felt, a bit flat. But, of course, that may be how the writer and director wanted him to be - although, if it was, why use such a capable actor? One question that comes to mind is, if Panem is supposed to be the world of the future, can we look forward to going back to almost Elizabethan pompery with ridiculous wigs, make up and facial hair for the gentry and poverty for the working classes? If so, I hope I don't live that long!A gripping movie that I will watch more than once again.",9,2,8,15 October 2014
Ted," What a load of rubbish!
","After all the TV hype about the upcoming release of Ted, I was eagerly looking forward to seeing it. What a huge let-down!I can't blame this on cultural differences and simply say that American humour is different because I frequently laugh my socks off at Two-and- a-half Men and The Big Bang Theory on TV. Considering the inordinately high overall rating that this film has on IMDb I can only assume that it's me because I don't think I even smiled (let alone laughed!) once during it. The whole concept was ridiculous (is THAT funny?). Like, would the whole adult world happily accept a talking, walking, dope- smoking stuffed Teddy bear? Is this an indication of the world's mentality in 2012? I sure hope not!I honestly think that, in years to come, Mark Wahlberg, Mila Kunis and, perhaps most of all, Patrick Stewart will deeply regret ever having anything to do with this load of utter crap! They are both excellent actors and I find it hard to believe that they were so hard up financially that they needed the work. I note with particular interest that Mark has no less than five post-Ted movies - and Mila has six - in various stages of production so I wonder what on earth made them demean themselves with this. It's almost like prostitution of their art and talents!I believe there is a difference between realistic expletive language (like when the story centres around working men or underworld criminal gangs) but the gratuitous profanity in this film has no usefulness whatsoever unless, of course, it makes those of limited intelligence laugh - but do our filmmakers need to pander to this sort of audience? I guess it all comes down to who spends the most at the box-office. (more prostitution!) Basically, the story-line is absolute rubbish and an insult to the intelligence, the plot and dialogue are NOT the least bit funny and the romantic aspect defies belief. Mila should have run a mile the day she first learned about Ted and never come back!As usual, I stuck it out to the bitter end, because I am the eternal optimist and live in hope that something enjoyable will develop (as often happens in movies that start out a bit slowly or stupidly) but, in the case of Ted, I wish I had ejected it after the first five minutes! That's over an hour-and-a-half of my life I'll never get back! Sorry, I cannot recommend this movie for any reason - there isn't even any nice scenery in it!",1,37,71,14 July 2012
X-Men Origins: Wolverine," Seemed a bit violent for a children's movie
","I have never quite figured out who Stan Lee writes his material for. His ideas are, to say the least, extremely weird. His 'creatures' are referred to as 'mutants' but that's taking the term to ridiculous extremes. I mean, some children's' movies are bad enough. Little, impressionable kids grow up believing in anthropomorphised bears, chickens, dogs, cats and just about every other animal but this is obviously not aimed at children (I HOPE!). So who is it aimed at? Sheldon Cooper and his genius pals are huge Stan Lee fans which I have always found incongruous given that they are scientists (although, Sheldon often points out that his mother did have him tested for being crazy).Seriously though, where does this movie fit into the general scheme of things? Obviously it is fantasy, but I would question whether it is science fiction. If all the main characters were extraterrestrials then I could give them some credence but, for them to be human beings with weird attributes just doesn't gel with me. Human mutants are actually very sad people who have been cursed with things like blindness, paralysis and numerous other debilitating disabilities - the only ones who might be deemed fortunate being those with exceptionally high IQs or with eidetic memories (and it's questionable whether those are mutants anyway).To be confronted by indestructible weirdos is in the same vein as vampire and werewolf movies which are classified as horror, not sci- fi.Sorry, this is not my idea of a great way to spend over an hour-and- a-half.",5,0,3,7 December 2014
Dear John," What an indictment!!
","Dear John..... Well, we've heard that line before haven't we? This could have been a beautiful movie but, for me, it was totally ruined because I spent the better part of it being incensed by the way young American men allow their government to brainwash them into some sort of belief that by throwing their country's weight about all over the world, they are doing some good. They really do believe this and it's SO sad. Once upon a time, when one country wanted power, they went along to another country and had a straightforward war in which the victor became the conquering ruler and, rightly or wrongly, that was that. In fact, when you think about it, the first European settlers did just that in North and south America. The native peoples were decimated under some guise of 'civilization' (which is simply a word meaning 'OUR way of thinking') in which untold atrocities were committed and it was all OK! The 'cowboys' were the good guys and the 'Indians' were the bad guys and no one ever disputed that (except, of course, the native Americans whose ancestral lands were simply annexed by the superiorly armed immigrants.) Well, nowadays, that isn't so fashionable. Modern conventions dictate that, when one country colonises another, they not only reap the natural resources but they also have something called responsibility - and that can sometimes be expensive! So modern America has realised that a much more economical strategy is to simply 'help' countries where there is political unrest to 'democratically' install their own leaders (just so long as those leaders are the ones that America wants!!!) and then reap the benefits without any of the responsibility. (It failed miserably with the Taliban in Afghanistan didn't it?!! And now America is spending even more of her taxpayers' money and, in the context of this movie, her young men in a pathetic attempt to rectify it. And, what's even worse, by using bullying tactics like guaranteeing 'security' to smaller nations, they have conned them into joining them in their conflicts.)OK, so what has all this got to do with 'Dear John' the movie? Who else but such a brainwashed, virile young man with a beautiful girl waiting at home to be his wife would volunteer to extend his tour of 'duty'? I put the word 'duty' in quotes because that is exactly what the American government have so successfully indoctrinated so many of her young men and women to sincerely believe it is - when, in actual fact, all they are is cannon-fodder for the politicians' power games. And what is truly SO sad is that they don't even realise it!!A (very) few Islamic extremists committed vile atrocities on September 11th 2001 and, within hours, the American government assisted by the irresponsible American media succeeded in inflaming practically the whole population into a frenzied hatred of anything Muslim or even middle eastern (but they didn't stop them using middle eastern oil!!!). I believe that even after over ten years since the New York attack, there are still Americans who don't realise that it probably caused more embarrassment and shame to Islam than it did to anyone else. There will always be extremists in all walks of life. (What, for example, is the general American attitude towards the KKK right there in their own midst?) How many American citizens are Muslims who just want to live in peace with the freedom to follow their own faith IN America? And how many of them are ashamed of what a small minority are costing their country because their own government haven't got the brains to see what's in front of their noses?But then I suppose there wouldn't have been a story if John had acted rationally and taken the opportunity to return to a normal life and be with his dad when he had a stroke and with his girl who gave him a hell of a lot more chance than he deserved! The love story of movie is lost in a sad political statement on corrupt American politics!",6,1,2,5 October 2012
Hugo," What are French clocks like?
","There are already plenty of reviews about Hugo and another one singing it's praises wouldn't really add much so I won't bother with that other than to say it is one of the best films I've seen this year.However, there is one query that I have and that concerns all the clocks in the film. I have never been to France and so I have absolutely no personal experience to draw on. When I was at school several decades ago (but later than the 1930s date of the action in Hugo) I was always taught that the French used twenty-four hour clocks. I cannot imagine that a director with the acumen and expertise of Martin Scorsese would make such an elementary error as having the wrong clock in French railway stations and also no one has mentioned this in the goofs section so what's the answer please?",8,3,4,10 July 2012
No Country for Old Men," At last, a movie where people behave like people really behave!
","What does one say about 'No Country For Old Men' that hasn't already been said except, perhaps, that, in what seems most unusual for movies, the characters behave as you would expect them to behave and not in some totally ridiculous way? Well, almost!For example, when Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin) happens upon a drug deal gone wrong whilst out hunting in the desert and finds the bag of money - over 2 million bucks - meant to pay for the drugs, I was saying to myself, 'Grab it and get the hell out of there.' and that's just what he did - EXCEPT that, after going home to his wife, Carla (beautifully portrayed by Scottish actress, Kelly Macdonald), he decides to take water to the one member of the drug gang who wasn't quite dead when he was there earlier (even though there was about a 99% chance he wouldn't still be alive when he got back). But then I suppose he had to do that, firstly to show that he had a heart and also so that the film actually had a plot!Then later, when Llewelyn knows that Chigurh (Javier Bardem), the apparently emotionless, cold-blooded thug hired by the drug boss to recover his money, is coming to his hotel room, rather than rush out, guns blazing, to meet him, he does exactly what I'm sure every viewer would do in the same circumstance and turns off the light and waits, gun at the ready, for Chigurh to open the door - EXCEPT that, instead of waiting 'til he can see him, shoots through the still-closed door and, of course, only wings him. But then I suppose it had to be that way so that the film didn't end somewhat lamely right there.Actually, Chigurh, is a much more believable evil villain that Freddy Kreuger (Nightmare on Elm Street) or Jason Voorhees (Friday the 13th) because, whilst he seems almost indestructible - sewing himself up where he's been shot and making a makeshift sling and walking away with his bone poking out of his arm - it isn't taken to a totally ridiculous level as in so many thriller suspense movies. Bardem's work was well- deserving of his Oscar because he was very convincing as having absolutely no respect for human life even though he tried to give the impression that he did by tossing coins for his victims to decide whether they would die or not - even though he killed them anyway!One thing I learned from NCFOM was that, if ever I find a bag full of money, I'll check it thoroughly for homing devices before taking it anywhere recognisable. I should be so lucky!The film stops where Cormack McCarthy's book doesn't and so I'm surprised that there hasn't been a sequel movie where we find out what Chigurh does after seemingly walking away leaving just about everyone (including his own associates - giving the impression that he just wants the money all to himself) except Sheriff Bell (Tommy Lee Jones) dead. Maybe there will be one eventually. I kinda hope so because, until we see his demise, I'll be wondering where he is!You'll need to read the book to find out - or, of course wait for the sequel.",8,2,3,12 April 2014
District 9," Where were the rest of the world?
","District 9 is an odd film. I quite enjoyed the mockumentary style of the opening part and the not-very-hidden allegory to the South African apartheid policies of the past. And I must say that I'm amazed that the South African government didn't attempt to ban the film (or, should I say, that I never heard of any attempt to ban it?)One thing is for sure, the sci-fi parody of SA politics is not difficult to see unless you've had your head buried in the sand for the last 50 years!One surprising aspect of this movie is that Peter Jackson was one of its producers but didn't direct it. I couldn't help wondering why since he has no South African ties that I know of.But the most glaring anomaly of the whole movie is the fact that South Africa seems to be all alone in dealing with the aliens. In real life that simply would NEVER happen! The USA would have immediately stormed in and taken charge (whether asked to or not) and, in keeping with this type of movie, Stallone, Schwarzennegger, Willis and all the other tough guys methodically wiped out the aliens, friendly or not!As one who enjoys fantasy movies I'm afraid that District 9 left me a bit ho-hum but, if you like the genre, by all means give it a go. I'll stick with Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit!",6,0,0,10 December 2014
Tucker and Dale vs Evil," A pleasant surprise.
","I was lent the DVD of Tucker and Dale Vs Evil and decided to watch it without looking it up on IMDb first so I had no idea what to expect. There was no one in the cast that I knew and, from the title, I got the impression that it would be one of those low-budget horror movies that are OK if you happen to like low-budget horror movies. Well, at first, it seemed like my assessment was going to be pretty correct and, maybe worse, the whole thing was going to be yet another revamp of the college-kids-on-a-remote-vacation-in-a-forest affair. I wasn't even sure whether to continue watching. But then, just at the right time, everything took on a whole new complexion. I increasingly found myself being reduced to fits of laughter and asking myself why I was laughing at a gruesome horror movie and realising it was because it was actually very funny! Maybe I have a too-vivid imagination but, in spite of what was, to say the least, an extremely bizarre sequence of circumstances (most ending in gruesome disaster), it was remarkably believable - especially when one remembered that some of the kids were smoking dope and thus somewhat erratic in their reactions. After all, as one whose sport was orienteering, I am well aware that is IS actually possible to impale oneself on a sharp tree branch when not looking where one is going at full speed in a forest. (Fortunately, I never did it as dramatically as the young guy in this film!). Without going into each event in detail, when you think about it, none of the fatal events were ridiculous - although it might be true to say that for so many to happen all in a short space of time was! But then it IS a movie and, as such, needs to hold viewers' attention.The juxtaposition of a couple of simple but likable hillbilly guys, one very deranged college kid and several of his contemporaries resulted in a most entertaining and enjoyable hour-and-a-half. If you're not into horror movies, please don't let the fact that is categorised under that genre put you off watching Tucker and Dale vs Evil. You could just discover a different source of enjoyment. And, of course, the ending leaves the way wide open for lots more Tucker and dale sequels. Here's hoping!",7,0,1,9 October 2012
The Wolf of Wall Street," Now I know.
","I have always been very skeptical about those 'get rich (quick?)' seminars we see advertised and formed my own conclusion that, if you're a charismatic orator and, perhaps, an author of a best-selling motivation book, and highly overrate your own value, it isn't hard. You don't need to be good in business (legitimate business, that is). All you need to be is a good con artist.I have heard it said that, if you make an A4 size flier with your picture filling most of it and just something like, 'MARVO the world's greatest hypnotist is coming to (your town)' along with dates and venues in small type at the bottom and get a whole pile of them letter-boxed, even if you have no idea about hypnotism, you can do this. A couple of days after the fliers have been delivered, just go and knock on some doors until someone says, 'Wow!! You're that hypnotist on the flier I got the other day!' Then just look the person straight in the eye and say, 'Sleep' and they will fall down right there in front of you. The person saw the flier and believed what it told them so that, when they saw the person whose picture was on it, they were already pre-programmed. And that, in a nutshell, is how con- men work.And that is also what 'The Wolf of Wall Street' is all about. How Scorsese made it last for three whole hours is certainly testimony to his expertise as a director. But, strangely (for me) I thought he really missed the boat as far as the film's full potential was concerned. Maybe Bob Guccione would have done it better because he would have REALLY shown all the porn scenes without bed sheets and subtle camera angles to hide the juicy bits. Whether the movie would have been better for that is, of course, debatable depending on where you stand with regard to both porn and accuracy. (Maybe there is a directors cut version!)As it is though, 'Wolf' is nothing more than (I presume) an insight into just how corrupt the world of big business is and makes me glad that I have never been there. It is nothing more than three hours of gratuitous profanity, drug abuse and naked debauchery and definitely not worth the time.How it got nominated for an Academy Award mystifies me. I can only assume that some members of the Academy related to it in some way.",6,0,1,25 March 2014
WALL·E," OK if you like this sort of thing I guess.
","Make no mistake, Wall-E is a well-made movie with a good moral. But I'm afraid that, for me, that's where it ends.I was reminded a bit of '2000 - A Space Odyssey' when the robot tried to take over the spaceship. But then I suppose, in this instance, practically everyone was a robot! Even the humans reminded me of the 1969 Zager and Evans number 1 hit song, 'In the Year 2525' where they were all like vegetables. (You need to listen to the song if you don't remember it and you'll see my point!)I'm afraid I just can't quite come to terms with two robots falling in love and so the story was pretty much wasted on me. However, the idea of the Earth slowly becoming one huge garbage dump sometime in the distant future isn't so unbelievable! Maybe the time will actually come when the future of the whole human race depends on a cockroach and one little weed growing in an old boot!",6,1,3,6 December 2014
The Blind Side," Absolutely Beautiful
","For years I have adored Sandra Bullock. For me, she pales all those screen sirens through the ages into insignificance and 'The Blind Side' expresses her unequaled talent and natural beauty superbly! As an Aussie, I know nothing at all about American Football (and, from what I have seen on movies and TV, I don't particularly want to!). That's not to knock it though - I just don't understand it and, since it is pretty well exclusive to the USA, I have no real need to. However, that's not the point of this review. In actual fact, the game doesn't matter. The point is that the Tuohy family - and Leigh-Anne (Bullock) in particular see the potential and the need in a young man who couldn't be much more different from their own lifestyle and they give helping him their everything (and MORE).Bearing in mind that 'The Blind Side' is based on a true story, all I can say is that I would have loved to have known the Tuohy family. What awesome Christians from Dad to the young son. Actually, all the time I watched this film, I couldn't help seeing a family that attends my own church here in Queensland. The total absence of any sort of jealousy and the genuine love that emanated from every member of that family was just SO like my friends. (Actually, my friends here would make great subjects for a similar biographical drama - but I know their modesty would never let that happen! Pity really!) When the pictures came on with the credits at the end I was amazed at how well all five actors portrayed the real Tuohys and Michael. (Didn't Sandra look gorgeous as a blonde too! - I'm not biased!!) So this is the second time in as many weeks that I have sat through a movie centred around American Football and loved every minute of them (the other one was 'The Grid Iron Gang'). I don't mind admitting that I had to wipe the occasional tear from my eye during this one too. How refreshingly pleasant to watch a movie where the predominance is on decent, loving and caring people rather than an over-abundance of violence, profanity and unpleasantness - especially when it's a true story. If I could, I'd give this 11 out of 10 and, if it doesn't win some major awards, the judges are all dormant!",9,1,2,16 November 2014
Win Win," Refreshingly 'nice' tale.
","Win Win is both emotional and light - which is pretty hard to do when you think about it - and, for that, director Tom McCarthy is to be congratulated. I think that there wouldn't be too many viewers who couldn't relate to one or more of the characters in this story. Mike (Paul Giamatti) is a struggling lawyer with bills piling up (mind you, I never personally met a struggling lawyer - maybe he lives in the most law-abiding town on the planet where no one needs legal representation or even conveyancing because no one wants to leave such a great environment! I kinda doubt that though so one has to wonder why he's struggling - given the hourly rate lawyers charge.Anyway, in spite of somewhat mercenary motivation, Mike clearly does have a heart and makes every effort to locate his client Leo, an elderly slightly demented old man's daughter without success. She is a drug- addict who hasn't seen her dad in years and, it would seem, wants it to stay that way. However, unbeknown to Leo, he also has a grandson, Kyle, who shows up out of the blue and, since Mike has put Leo into a retirement facility - although he told the court that he would take care of Leo in his own home - Kyle has nowhere to stay. Mike is also the local high school wrestling coach with a pretty mediocre team and when it turns out that Kyle is a very good wrestler, Mike persuades him to stay with him and his family and go to school and, of course, join the wrestling team. The insertion of Kyle into the team not only provides some wins at last but also motivates the rest of the boys to the point where they win their first big tournament. Kyle fits in well with Mike's family and the school and, perhaps, most importantly, with himself because when he arrived, he had a huge chip on his shoulder from having a lousy relationship with his (very young) mother Cindy (played by Kiwi actress, Melanie Lynskey - crazy Rose of Two-and-a-half men fame). Everything is going well for a while. Leo, whilst not totally happy at the retirement home is contented enough. Mike's financial situation is relieved by the support payments he is getting for being Leo's guardian. Kyle is fitting in well with Mike's family and his new schoolmates and wrestling team friends. And then Cindy shows up. She SAYS she wants to look after her dad and take him back to Ohio with her where she wants to look after him - although it is obvious that all she really wants is, firstly, the $1500-a-month support payments and, ultimately, Leo's personal savings. Her arrival with a layer totally disrupts everything. Kyle wants nothing to do with her and Leo definitely doesn't want to leave his beloved home and go to Ohio and, of course, Mike stands to lose his 'extra' income as well as his star wrestler (because Kyle completely flips out when his mother goes to his biggest match yet and gets disqualified.If the ages of Melanie Lynskey and Alex Shaffer (who plays Kyle) are the ages of their characters, Cindy would have only been 15 or 16 when she gave birth and yet her father didn't even know he had a grandson.When it seems that everything is going to fall apart, Mike's better nature takes over and he takes Leo back to his own house and agrees to monitor him there and, to get her off his and her father and son's back, agrees to pay Cindy the whole of the $1500 a month just to stay away. To make ends meet Mike takes an evening job as a bartender - which, as I say, seems a bit weird for a qualified lawyer. Whilst we aren't told so, I like to think that, after he finished school, Kyle might have gone to live with his grandpa and become a world champion wrestler with Mike as his manager. Then the title 'Win Win' would certainly have come true.",7,0,0,20 September 2012
Looper," Strange.....
","Well, this is one movie that I have absolute;y no idea what I think of it! So, you may ask, why am I writing a review? Good question. I suppose the answer is that, once I started watching Looper, it was too difficult to stop. Several times I wanted to but then I thought, that, if I did stop, I would miss something great. (This was not diminished by the fact that the movie had a score of 75 on IMDb, by the way!).Looper is certainly not a movie to watch if you're hoping for some light entertainment. It takes not one, but two science fiction themes - time travel and telekinesis - and mixes them all up so that there's no guessing what's coming next. Whilst Bruce Willis and Joseph Gordon Levitt (who both play the same guy 30 years apart) share the star billing, for me, the real star of this movie was Pierce Gagnon who played Cid, a 10-year-old telekinetic kid. Some of his facial expressions were brilliant for a child actor and I have no doubt that we will be seeing a lot more of him over the next 60 years (if he doesn't destroy the world before then, that is!)The biggest disappointment for me was Emily Blunt's American drawl (albeit very well done) because her English accent (Young Victoria for example) is so delightful - but then I guess that just shows her star quality.Maybe I'm a bit slow, but, right up to the end, I was wondering how the whole thing was going to work itself out and, yes, I was surprised!So my advice is, if you aren't into real complex sci-fi, Looper is probably not for you. I would say the same if you're thinking of hiring something for some pleasant light entertainment. However, if you're a real sci-fi and film noir enthusiast, you'll probably love Looper. Good luck with it.",5,2,3,14 November 2014
Mad Max: Fury Road," Has everyone also gone mad?
","If this is entertainment, then I'm clearly not open to this genre!Because Mad Max - Fury Road won six Oscars for Aussie, I figured I'd better see it although I must admit, I had severe reservations.They weren't unfounded! I guess the Oscars were confined to technical aspects of the movie and I suppose one has to acknowledge the skills of those people so recognised.However, how on earth this movie ever got nominated for best film, I have absolutely no idea. It's not like I don't enjoy fantasy films because the Lord of the Rings trilogy comprise some of the best films ever made.What has happened to all the old values?",3,8,15,2 March 2016
The Great Gatsby," Too long, too stupid and too boring!
","Sorry folks, but, after all the hype about The Great Gatsby - including the fact that it is based on what has always been in my mind as classic literature (although I have never read the book), I was very disappointed. F Scott Fitzgerald is said to have been inspired by lavish Long Island parties he attended and, whilst I have no doubt that there were some lavish lifestyles in the aftermath of the First World War, I cannot imagine anything like the parties that Jay Gatsby laid on for people he didn't even know. The sad thing was that those parties weren't even enjoyable - or, should I say, I wouldn't have wanted to be anywhere near one! They were laden with loathsome 'would be if they could be' social climbers. So, for the first part of the movie, I found my skin creeping in disgust - and I don't watch movies for that effect!Leonardo diCaprio and Tobey Maguire were the consummate professional actors that they usually are and it certainly isn't their fault that this movie is, in a word, boring. Whilst I have seen Carey Mulligan in Brothers, I don't really remember her. Maybe that's because she isn't memorable and there are dozens of better-known actresses that could have played Daisy Buchanan a lot better. The real star of the movie was the beautiful yellow car! Sorry Baz, but I can't enthuse about Gatsby even though I'm Australian!",5,1,3,27 July 2014
