Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Nice! Nice!
",I first introduced to 'Sacha' by the movie 'Ali G in Da House'. The movie was a low budget but a real nice one. And after some time I got my hands to the DVD's of 'Ali G Show'. Where the part of 'Borat' tops the all gimmicks of him. The movie is about an innocent and honest man from Kazakistan. Who is a news reporter in National TV there. He is given task to make a documentary about the life style of American people. So that Kazakistan can adopt it and became rich and progress. So 'Borat' along with his producer 'Azamat' set out for USA. There they meet different people from rich to poor to Jews and Celebreties. And in the end the trip was really a benefit for Kazakistan.,9,1,9,21 December 2006
