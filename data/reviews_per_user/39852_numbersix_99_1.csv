Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Finally, she will kill bill
","I had the honour of seeing an advanced screening of this wonderful movie. However, at this stage I confess I prefer part one a little more.Part two is different, quite different. It slows down a lot, it hangs on the characters. A great idea in theory, but not in delivery. Tarantino seems a little too much in love with himself and his characters, so he lingers on them a fraction too long for comfort. when the actions comes (the Elle Driver fight scene), boy does it come.Those expecting more of what volume one promised may be disappointed, and most will find the dialogue a little nerdy and uninteresting, but nevertheless it's a very strong movie, and without doubt worth repeated viewings.",6,0,1,7 April 2004
