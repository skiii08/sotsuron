Sucker Punch," I walked out of theater
","This movie was made by sadistic group of people taking art to a low level, basically these people who made this movie bet you take a crap while having sex. Can NBC report these guys to the police for exporting girls. Disgrace, disgrace and the box office says it all. 170 million to make and 36 million total gross. Well how would these guys who made this movie have any morals when people like Woody Allen married his daughter and Hollywood praise him for it but 20/20 will do a whole story about someone like him and destroy such people to sell television time. Sucker punch should be a history marker about our society to the next generation how when we talk about protecting you people but our entertainment exploits women and children, this is a sexual deviant dream movie. Hollywood again is a disgrace.",Null,0,4,27 November 2011
