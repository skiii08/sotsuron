50 First Dates," Worth seeing 50 times.
","Ok ... maybe not fifty times, but this is a movie worth seeing more than once.   I'm guessing those who have given this movie a low rating are the skeptics out there who have never fallen head over heals in love with someone, and I don't think you can really get this movie or buy into it unless you have.  I mean who would stick around with someone whom you knew wouldn't remember you the very next day, each day, day after day.  Love makes you do crazy things.I really enjoyed this movie.  I even went into it thinking that this is a movie done before again and again and was pleasantly surprised.  Rob Schneider was a great side kick (as he seems to play very well as oppose to starring in a film.)  He'll certainly keep you laughing along with Adam and Drew in their quirky semi-romantic one liners.  SO even if you've never been madly in love with someone, you'll get a kick out of quite a few secenes (especially in the beginning with the sick walrus -- one of the funniest scenes in a movie in the past year or so.)",8,0,0,14 February 2004
Groundhog Day," Bill Murray at one of his bests!
","For those of you who have recently gone to see 50 First Dates and loved it, then go to your video store and rent this (or buy it since it's worth seeing again.)  It certainly was my favorite film of 1993.  I've always been a Bill Murray fan and this one is one of my favorites (Scrooged is my favorite.) I fell in love with Andie MacDowell in this movie.  I just dig her naive demeanor. And Stephen Tobolowsky plays a great obnoxious Insurance salesman. 
Great movie, funny liners, and quite heartwarming as you watch Bill Murray's character change from a pompus prima donna to an actual caring non-selfabsorbing person.8 of 10.",8,1,2,15 February 2004
It's a Wonderful Life," My all time favorite movie
",Not too many movies come along that I can enjoy watching over and over again.  This one ranks #1 on my list as such a movie I must see every year. IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE embodies all that is good and wonderful about life and friends and why we exist in my opinion.  Long live Jimmy!,9,1,5,16 May 2001
Shrek," Very entertaining, but minor bouts with language.
","It's not often that you can take your little one to go see an animated movie and get caught up in the flick more than they.  Shrek is one such movie. Being both a big Mike Myers and Eddie Murphy fan, I wasn't disappointed at all in either voices (Mike has always done a great Scottish accent!)  You do, however, have to watch out for an occasional 'damn' being thrown out, but it most likely will go right over your young one's heads.You will certainly fall in love with this movie and its delightful message/moral at the end.",8,1,3,4 June 2001
