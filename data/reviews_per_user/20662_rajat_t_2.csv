The Ring," it's a senseless movie overall!
","No doubt it is a scary movie but then what else are the horror movies suppose to do ? The end of the movie is quite abrupt and the director of the movie has left it to the imagination of audiences to keep guessing what was really behind all the suspense. The end of the movie is still not clear to me.If anyone can explain it to me I would be grateful :) but then I am ready to debate. At one point of time, around 15 minutes before the movie actually ends, I thought that the movie was over and appeared to make somewhat sense but then everything became confusing afterwards, thanks to the non-sense imagination of the director.I went with two other friends to see it and each one of us had a different opinion regarding the plot of the movie.You will certainly be engrossed in it throughout but then the end will make you kinda upset.It's upto an individual to decide whether to see it or not.Certainly not to my expectations as I feel it is much more hyped than what it actually is.--Rajat Tripathi",Null,0,0,13 November 2002
Ocean's Eleven," a very good movie
","With a nice plot, tight sequence and a good direction this is certainly a movie that is worth watching. The movie revolves around 11 men who are out there to steal money from three casinos in Las Vegas! It is interesting to see how they work on the strategies for doing their acts. However, it would have been more fun if the director has put some more emphasis on the actual robbery scene. Although the plan is perfectly designed, it looks a simple task when they actually carry it out.But the bottom line is go for this movie! You will like it.--Rajat Tripathi",Null,0,0,19 November 2002
