Child 44," unbalanced and to much to tell in to little time
","I read somewhere that the first cut was 5 hours. They should have cut it in 5 TV-episodes and it might have done the story some justice. Now it's full of storythreads that go no where. Who and why is the killer killing. Why is there anymosity between former collegues etc. Why is the General promoted to the new murder squad? All he did was get some photo's from an archive. Is there a darker conspiracy going on? Why is Tom Hardy a danger.
After an hour the russian accent start to work on you nerves, also that Tom Hardy doesn't speak full sentences.
The menace of the MGB was better portrayed in 'Death of Stalin' and more irritating, annoying details.Recut it to a TV-serie, Sovjet-Noir?, and maybe you can salvage something",3,2,3,4 March 2019
Suicide Squad," Comics are not (allways) for kids
","And 'Suicide squad' proves it. The trouble I have with most of the Marvel movies and certainly most of the DC TV-series is that they are all made with the 12 to 16 year old's in mind. The last Batman's, Man of steel and Suicide squad all have a grittiness I like. Deadpool could have been a great movie. But the constant joking (i know, it's also in the comics)took the fun out of it. The only memorable part was when he took it up the Khyber. The TV-shows Arrow and Flash are kiddie-shows just a tiny bit less camp than the 1966 Batman-series. Avengers are to flashy. It took 15 years to rebuild the WTC, after the battle of New York (Avengers), the next movie (which one was that? Can't remember) is cruising around NYC like nothing happened But suicide squad is different. OK, you have one-liners and the camaraderie in the end. But only Harley Quinn is the comic relief and you don't get the feeling that in the morning after the ........ all is well. So, was it bad? NO!!!!!! could it be better? Sure, but don't ask me were.",8,0,1,17 September 2016
