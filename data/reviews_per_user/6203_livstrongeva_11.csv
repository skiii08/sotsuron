Iron Man 3," Probably the best of all three
","Iron man is one of my favorite heroes from Marvel universe. This means that here you might read not entirely objective opinion and I'm sorry for that.If you watch Adventure Time, you might have stumbled onto an episode when Jake was sick and asked Finn to tell him a story. But not just any story - it had to have action, drama, mystery, suspense and romance. Well, what can I say - in that case Jake would have loved Iron Man 3.The movie was packed with technological genius stuff. If you are a techno geek like me and enjoy cool gadgets you will enjoy this movie. As always it had scenes of Tony working for inventions, JARVIS, many suits and even more which I don't want to spoil.The center again was Tony's and Pepper's romance, which was very touching and lighting up girls' hearts (guys, here's your excuse to take your girlfriend to this movie. Of course if your girlfriend is also a techno geek like me, she will be the one dragging you there) But it is great that Pepper is not just a simple bystander who just yells for.Tony, she's the girl in the middle of the action and always ready to protect her man as Tony is ready to protect her. But it's not just puppy love - they have arguments, they push, but they pull even harder. And that's why we love them.In this movie we get another glimpse into Tony's past, into his personality. We get to see what he is really like. He is the mechanic as he calls himself - the guy who fixes everything, the guy who makes everything work.I won't even talk about action, because there's plenty of it. The comedy is also greatly put in between the action and romance.All in all, I don't want to spoil anything. But I just want to say that there were things that made me wonder about Avengers 2. And now I'm really curious about it.",9,16,25,24 August 2013
Shaun of the Dead," Zombies in society
","With so much craze about the zombies, me and my friend decided to watch something not so new, a movie which came out a bit before the zombie fashion. We actually had no idea it would turn out this good.This movie started out slow and if you're thinking during the first fifteen minutes whether or not you should turn it off, trust me, it gets better. We were literally shouting at the screen and couldn't get away from the screen - the movie was a thriller masterpiece. And it was not like usual zombie movies or Walking Dead when people with no fear kill zombies straight away - these were normal people with no plan, a lot of fear and a wish to survive. So the two friends - Shaun and Ed decide to round everybody up and hide in their favorite bar until everything cools off. Good plan, right? Well the plan always sounds good in theory, but in practice there's usually a lot of mishaps.It is actually interesting how from the beginning Shaun shows similarities with zombies - how he gets up from bed, his all morning routine is worked out and he does not have to think at all - just follow the schedule. Life seems simple. Actually, when the zombie fever hits, he only notices that when one of them wanders into their yard and even then they think that the girl is just totally wasted and not dead. The realization only comes after they think they killed the girl by accident and then she rises up to attack them. This is quite scary as it shows how people themselves have become zombies or unaware of their surroundings and their activities that they can't recognize what is going on right in front of their eyes. Mike Rugnetta from PBS idea channel was saying (check out his video here - he has great ideas on the zombie topic) that the craze for zombies started out as a fear that technologies will take us over and in zombie apocalypse the only thing you can trust is yourself and your skills. And that is true as none of the technological wonders like cellphones or computers are really helping out when you need to get away from the zombie horde that is chasing you.But why I loved this movie was because it was funny, sad and a thriller at the same time and because of the ending: the zombies become a part of the civilization, being pets, loved ones (!) or even having jobs. As funny as that sounds, it is quite scary. I mean it is imaginable to be replaced by a machine as civilization grows, but can you imagine being replaced by somebody who'salready dead?",10,2,5,3 September 2013
Midnight in Paris," People make the time
","Some people might say that this is a very easy movie. Well, they're not wrong. It's not super complicated. It's quite predictable actually. But still, do all movies have to be about the meaning of life, full of wisdom and so on? I think no. Some movies are just there for relaxation.I'm not saying that this movie is really simple and not worth watching. On the contrary - it has quite an important subject nowadays. How many times have you bee speaking to other people and heard that they do not belong in this time? 'oh, I should have been born in the 70s, because I so belong there' 'the music is not good now, I wish I have lived in he golden days of AC/DC and Led Zeppelin' 'people don't know how to behave now, I should have been born in the 50s' and so on. Or it's not the right country, not the right attitude of people or The list in my opinion is endless.So, what this movie does, it takes a confused writer and sends him to the golden age where he meets Hemingway, Fitzgerald and others. His writing improves, his view broadens. But through his journey we come to understand that if you are unhappy with the present, you will always find excuses. We come to understand that it is not the time that makes the age golden - it's the people.",7,0,0,24 August 2013
Now You See Me," Where magic and reality collides
","I was always amazed by magic tricks when I was little (OK, I still am - I like magic, OK?). Heck, I even had books on how to perform magic tricks and illusions. but after a while I stopped doing them because I realized how much I have to prepare for them.The movie shows some of the work that magicians do, but of course this movie takes four magicians from a level of entertainers to a level of vigilantes or Robin Hoods or maybe even personal avengers (depends how you see it, but all of these apply). The storyline is that four illusionists are lead together to a room where they find blueprints for the best show ever. So they become the Four Horsemen and start doing the show (after a year of preparation of course). The thing is, they capture FBI and Interpol's attention because during their first part of the show (show is from three parts) they rob a bank. How did they do it? Well, you could say magic, but let's not forget that this is a movie about illusionist and as I said before, illusions need preparations.The whole movie is really fast pace, which you would not expect from a movie about magicians. Actually, the camera was moving so fast you could feel that you're running alongside FBI and Interpol. There are a lot of wide shots here as well because illusions are best performed when audience views them from afar. Of course, there are always those who still are very attentive because they want to know how tricks are performed. One of those people is Thaddeus Bradley and he is the one who seems to best understand how everything is performed. He also brings the concept of the Eye - a league of magicians and illusionist who with their illusions try to level the scale between rich and poor (what did I say? Robin Hoods). And apparently he is right about everything (even about that he was framed).The movie is mesmerizing and the change of characters gets you going (not to mention the beautifully performed tricks) and you don't even notice that it's the end of the movie. For me the end was surprising and a bit disappointing. Yes, I loved that there was that plot twist that the fifth Horseman was the FBI agent (I thought it was the Interpol agent). But I did not like that he was also the leader of the EYE and that he had to come back for the French girl. He could have left her a message, explaining how the tricks are connected. The Eye could have been left a mysterious faceless league, it would have been more mysterious and I guess then more people would actually start believing that something like that might exist. But that's just my opinion.I just think some things are better left unexplained.",7,0,2,24 August 2013
Scott Pilgrim vs. the World," Scott Pilgrim vs. Reality
","The movie Scott Pilgrim vs. The World is usually regarded as a fun movie about a guy who has to defeat seven evil exes to become a boyfriend of mysterious girl Ramona Flowers who roller-blades through subspace to deliver Amazon packages. Sounds kind of unreal doesn't it? But that's just the surface of the movie. If you re-watch a movie a couple of times it becomes not just an adventure comedy about a made up life, but the slightly exaggerating mirror of everyday life.The story tells about the Canadian guy called Scott Pilgrim who:-Has a girlfriend -Plays in a band -Has his own place (well yes, OK, it's more Wallace's (his gay roommate) place, but still) Everything seems normal. One small problem – he gets interested in Ramona Flowers, the new girl in town. He doesn't know where he will get into, but hey, love is blind. Soon he finds out about the seven evil exes he has to defeat in order to be with her.Sounds unreal? Or does this movie tell us about real life?Well first of all, this movie's main theme is that you have to fight for what you love. It can be your hobby, your dream job, your dream position, and yes, your dream girl/boy. It may not be just one battle, but after each one you get more experience (or more coins if you're Scott) and that helps when you need to defeat the boss. It may require some sacrifices – you might have to drop your favorite hobby, but hey, it's worth it. Of course, if you fail miserable you can always try again – if you earned an extra life.Second of all, the movie tells about the nature of human relationship. It tells about supporting friends, who would give us helpful critique or give us a push when we don't know what to do. It talks about how you can get to know a person, how little by little people open up to each other and start trusting. Another topic is baggage. When you think about it, we all have baggage like Ramona says. And she's completely right. Why? We never know how to handle a relationship – nobody teaches it, you have to learn it yourself and along the way you make mistakes and people get hurt. And all you were trying to do was to be happy.This movie shows that in order to be happy, you have to earn the power of love and more importantly self respect. And maybe even your evil side is not so bad, when you are ready to accept it. After all, you are the person you will be living the rest of your life with.",10,0,2,25 August 2013
Across the Universe," Musical challenging your perception and taking you into an interesting journey
","Musicals are always catchy. They just get you into this weird world where everybody sings their deepest thoughts. Of course, there are people who say that musicals are just about love, they are not interesting and all they can offer is a good soundtrack. I respectfully disagree.This movie is a masterpiece. It shows the essence of 70s, of how the world was changing and how people were forced to change together. It is the middle of Vietnam war. People are tired of fighting. But still - there's a war. Young people are forced into recruits (if they don't volunteer). But overall I believe it shows how people are fighting their battles - either by facing them or going around. But it's more than that - it'a how they are living their lives - you could think that they have absolutely no fear as some just dive in without even thinking.Of course, the main thing is love. All you need is love how Beatles say. It shows how powerful, how uniting it is. How it even can cross the ocean and what keeps it going.This movie is also about fantasy and imagination. It just shows how person's mind is working. When Max is going to the army, he sees Uncle Sam as a frightening person and all the soldiers as the same person multiplied.Last thing - if you ever thought that Beatles have songs just about love - this movie is a must. The soundtrack is just breathtaking and mind-blowing when you realize it's not even all of the Beatles songs.All in all, this movie is a masterpiece with wonderful music concentrating on a love story and including fantasy and imagination.",10,1,2,24 August 2013
Up," Animated movies are not only for children
","I am usually a fan of good animated movies as they put very good ideas and themes through simple symbols. They have everything simple yet complex. But for children these topics go easy and subconsciously.So this movie is how a person named Carl gets older after a wonderful and full of love life, he stays alone and finally when everybody wants him to go to the Old People's home, he packs up his helium balloons and flies away. Literally.I actually did not know what this movie will be about when I sat down to watch it. I thought it's going to be some nice simple movie about relationship, but I did not expect for everybody to pack up and leave for South America. And I certainly did not expect talking dogs searching for a giant bird.Most people might think that 'oh, it's an animated movie, it's for children, what the hell can I learn from it?' Wellactually quite a lot, if it's good animated movie. You know, just because it's animated doesn't mean that it's worth nothing. It just like a movie with completely unknown actors. But hey, I'm getting of the topic.What this movie shows for me (because we all might interpret it quite differently) is that adventure only stops when you allow it to stop. So, you're old. So, you live alone. So, you never traveled. That doesn't mean that you will never have any adventures. They are just around the corner. You can see it if you let it. Of course, sometimes we need help in order to spot them or to truly enjoy them. And our pride or loneliness might not allow us to let anyone help us. But it's not such a fun adventure if you're having it alone. Other people is what makes the adventure truly remembered. And sometimes one adventure is all you need to take another look at your life.The way you see life, is it boring or no, depends on you and only you. If you are not allowing others to help you, you are the only one to blame if you say that you are lonely. I think these are great things to say to children who might start to say that they're bored. How can you be bored, when adventure is out there?",9,0,1,24 August 2013
Reservoir Dogs," The alienation in Reservoir Dogs
","Reservoir Dogs is a classic Quentino Tarantino film: tough characters, non-linear storyline, lots of action, shootouts and no unnecessary shots. So that means everything is very precisely thought through.I found one theme very interesting for me in this movie and that is the alienation between the criminal team who is doing a diamond heist.Sure, criminals usually don't trust each other, but usually you have to trust a person very much if you are attempting to do a heist together. So it is quite interesting that the members of this team are deprived of their names, personality - they all are assigned names and they are all wearing the same outfit as if to say that in this heist they leave their personal lives and identities behind them and they are different people here. Although in the beginning there are many close shots as if trying to get into the personalities, trying to make you acquainted with them.Actually there is distance even between the people who have the same profession - I'm talking about the two policemen. The wide space between them suggests that even though they are in the same boat working for the same cause they are so different. One of them got in that place by mistake: he was captured and tortured. The other one got accepted to the team after he pretended that he is a criminal.Another thing which just deepens the alienation is what you can see from MR. White's example. If you get attached to someone you get punished. He trusted his hurt partner Mr Orange who apparently was a policeman and he defended him he killed his partners and then got shot himself by the police.Another great thing in this movie is the music: it is used just a few times, in the intro, credits and in the torture scene. Now in the torture scene the music is used to show distance from human emotion. The lack of music elsewhere adds the realistic sense to the movie.So this movie for me really shows how people are just working for one goal, not caring about each other, alienating each other from themselves.",7,0,0,24 August 2013
The Silence of the Lambs," The collision between first impression and true identity in Silence of the Lambs
","Finally the time came and I decided to watch all of the Hannibal movies (because after the end of Hannibal's season 1 I was left with a void that only Hannibal Lecter could fill up). So I started with the famous Silence of the Lamb.If you are familiar with this movie, you probably know the plot: FBI agent Clarise Starling plaeyd by Jodie Foster needs the help of an incarcerated prisoner Hannibal Lecter played by Anthony Hopkins to catch a serial killer on the loose.So what was most interesting for me is that people aren't what they seem from the first impression. Yes, we see Clarise training but that is because she is the character with whom we are growing together, the main character. She is running through the forest what might be a metaphor that she is trying to defeat evil as forest always was a gloomy and scary place where monsters were hiding. But that is not how she is viewed by others. There are various scenes where she is the only woman in male company and everybody is looking at her as if she is not capable of anything, but she proves them wrong.On the other hand we see Hannibal as a calm person standing in his cell. You could not tell that this person is a heartless murderer who eats his victims. But that's what everybody knows about him. And that is why he is in the cell. Later we see his change when he attacks the guards, but I think more important is his entrance scene. It is just radiating with innocence, but you still have this feeling that something is wrong. Maybe it's not the cell, but most probably it's how he looks, how he smiles. But that you notice just a bit later.So that's what I saw in this movie – the difference between first impression and true people's nature. It's a bit scary how wrong can we sometimes be. Maybe next time we will regard the innocent looking person with more care.",8,1,2,24 August 2013
Easy A," The issue of personal space and gossip in today's world in a light movie
","When I'm sad, I enjoy watching light romantic movies. Preferably from the 80s. But everybody kept recommending me Easy A and finally I watched it. And you know what? That was exactly what I needed. It seemed just like a John Hughes movie (who is mentioned in the movie as well) - with some drama, with some life questions and with a happy ending where the guy gets the girl and drives away on a lawn mower.So what the movie is really about? Well, it's basically about a girl who lies to her friend that she slept with a guy and rumor starts spreading and then she helps out and lies for some other people and finally the whole school is thinking that she is a slut who sleeps for money and has STD. (Well that escalated quickly) But it wouldn't be a light romantic movie if it didn't have a happy ending and like I said, it does. So everything turns out fine in the end.It seems like a really simple movie, so why the hell am I writing about it here? Well first of all, because I can. Secondly, I liked that this movie was not some kind of cheesy movie about puppy love how most romantic movies seem to be.The movie for me is how your reputation can change so quickly from one thing to another and how gossip travels so fast that you can't even keep track. Aaand. The topic that is always relevant to nice people - how long are you going to be nice and how much you can let people step on your reputation while you're helping out other people? I think that there's always the last straw and the rule that the needs of many outweigh the needs of the few sometimes is not right. Especially when you're talking about yourself. Nobody wants to be in the few part. Nobody wants to get hurt. But that happens. I think the important part is while helping people out not to forget, that you are the person you are going to live the rest of your life and your decisions reflect mostly on your life. It is not OK, to be hurting yourself in case of others. Of course, I'm not saying that being nice and helping out is bad. But it should come both ways, not just from one side.Another topic is personal life and it's publication. In the world of Facebook, Twitter, Youtube, Tumblr and so on, personal life is not very personal anymore. But I think this is why it's even more important in keeping your privacy. And it is about time that people would respect the privacy boundaries. The information accessible to others is only what you approved, not what people gathered around. The only legit information about a person is what the person said himself and there are always two sides of the stories. Of course, it is quite different if the person lies and there's lies on top of lies and in order to set everything straight you need to crumble down the whole fortress of lies (caution: feelings might get hurt). In this time it's also very important to have somebody who you can trust, somebody who you can talk to. But most times the hardest decisions you have to make yourself.I really enjoyed watching this movie. And I would recommend it for a evening with ice-cream. You can easily watch it together with any John Hughes movies or alongside 10 things I hate about you. Why? Because this movie has some layers that you're left to think about when it's over and it puts a smile on your face. And those are the best movies to watch when you're sad.",8,1,2,24 August 2013
The Breakfast Club," Becoming of a team
","This movie has come out more than 25 years ago. That's even more than I have been around in this world. But still, this movie could be applied to me, my generation or the generations to come.And here comes the little question 'why?'. Well, I believe it's because it's universal. Social groups will always exist. I don't there ever be a time when jocks will be friends with nerds, popular with basket cases or criminals with all of them. Sure, we don't have class or casta system like in India, but it is surely visible when you have different interests. I don't think I ever seen the really popular kids hang out with the artsy ones and I don't think that's going to happen soon. (of course, the change is in our hands, but who am I to lecture anybody)If you are not familiar with this movie, it's about how 5 different young people get detention for completely different reasons on Saturday and their task is to write an essay explaining who they think they are. Well, the movie would be quite boring if they would just jump to the task. Instead how they are reacting to each other is really like a normal group dynamics (if you ever had to work with 4-5 other people, you'll know what I'm talking about).There are four stages of forming a good group ready to work and they go through all of them.Forming – they get to know each other a little. Who is who, the first impression - how different they are and it seems that they won't be able to do anything together. Storming – well, does this need to be explained? They quarrel. A lot. Feelings are hurt, people are mad.Norming – they get used to each other's quirks and how they all are bizarre, but just some of them are better of hiding it. They understand that all of them don't have perfect homes, all of them have some issues and all of them feel alone with those issues.Performing – they are talking, they are sharing about each other, coming up with solutions together. They are helping each other out, making them see that behind their social differences they are actually the same. They way how they from enemies become friends (of course we're not sure if they'll greet each other in the hallway) is just outstanding. It made me feel that no matter how weird you might be or what troubles you might have at home, you are not alone. And that thought brings comfort.",10,1,1,24 August 2013
