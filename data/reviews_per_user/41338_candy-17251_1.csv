Child 44," Destroy a large book
","It's really sad what they did with the original story, I hope that the directors of the film can be forgiven one day this. The movie to someone who read the book was difficult to understand, I can not even imagine how hard it was for someone who met for the first time in history. Completely lost the essence of history, why all originally begins, leaving a story with very little sense. They forget many important details and end of the movie has no comparison with the original ending of the book. It's like two completely different things. I regret to say that I was really excited when I found out that the movie 'Kid 44' premiered and then meet it.",1,28,54,30 July 2015
