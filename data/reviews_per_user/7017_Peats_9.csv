Mission: Impossible III," Predictable and Mild
","Bad things first. I am, for one, starting to feel very tired of seeing Tom Cruise running like a mad man down some street. It occurs in all his films, it seems. Okay, thats a little lame, but still. After about 10-15 minutes you have figured out the whole plot already and this with a disturbing dizziness from the constant shaking camera. The whole film, by the way, feel like a middle-thing of a made-for-TV-movie and blockbuster, but mostly, the plot feels like a elongated episode of a regular TV-show. Worst is the ending, it ends very mildly, and it plays right in to the spectators most obvious prediction.Good things. The effects are nice (but again, after 10-15 minutes they have used the whole arsenal) and there is really no extraordinary effect that you have not already seen in some other film. Nothing groundbreaking there. Tom Cruise is (with exception of his crazy running around) good, as always, but gets blown away by the performance of the glorious Seymour-Hoffman (who should be in all films, if you ask me... I just love him). The MIF-team feels comfortable with each other, and makes for a more pleasant ride. Last, there are a few scenes that are pretty cool, but they are to short, like the bridge sequence (maybe the best action in the whole flick). All in all, a very mediocre film. I am sort of disappointed... I mean, this is summer 2006, and something new has to come, but not from MI:3.",6,1,2,13 May 2006
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," A step in the right direction
","I had high hopes for the first one, but those hopes were drastically lowered of what was only a mediocre film. I had quite high hopes for this one as well, but tried my best to not expect to much. And thus I got almost exactly what I expected. This is a entertaining piece, fast, loud (not to loud, just right) and with some outstanding special effects (they are really, really great actually).I would seem this film had big potential for a higher score from my part, but unfortunately it plays it safe (as custom is in formula-A-feature film these days). What raises the grade from an average (5-6) is the marvelous performance of Johnny Depp and the improved (not yet perfected thought) performance of the other lead actors. Also the very nice, and progressively enhanced CGI helps the grade. This film contains more humor, which in my book never is a bad ingredient if done in a proper way, as here is.What lowers the grade is the safe-play, as mentioned. And I just can't give to much credit to a producer with dollar-signs in each eye (he himself a modern pirate, but less entertaining and more self-denying).So all in all, a mediocre film, with some shining details and fewer flaws then it's previous installment.",7,0,1,13 July 2006
"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"," Very, very lightweight.
","Well, this kind of light weight fantasy adventure is gonna become more and more common now. It's really a shame. Could someone, at least once, create a fantasy epic with raw brutality, pitch black story and with no concern for the budget (aka. 'we need to make it for a larger focus group, hence the mild violence and language and easy-to-melt-characters').I hate (yes HATE) the kids. The actors who plays them really suck, and I am usually very, very tolerant (always looking for positive upsides to a performance), but this just is to much crap. The director does not make any kind of statement in his 'work', and is pretty much non-present throughout the entire film. The Oscar-nominated special effects is not really that good, not 'A-Sound-of-Thunder-bad' but not very special at all, with the small exception of Aslan who actually looks like a real lion whenever he does not speak. The voice of Aslan by Liam Neeson is not good (Liam is a great actor, but the voice does not fit... or maybe the audio-mix is just crappy). The one thing that makes it worth watching is Tilda Swinton as the Queen, and also some the set-designs.All in all, two and a half hours of: 'When is the suspense ever gonna start!?', and; 'When will the four disturbing children die already!'",4,0,1,19 April 2006
Batman Begins," A fine production.
","Well, after being stupid enough to have listened to several critics comments about this film, how dark and great it was, I went to see it... and all in all I had to high expectations. It's a good movie with good actors, great cinematography and all that, but the action (and I am for sure NOT an action-buff at all) never gets into that higher gear that this film needs.And no matter how fun it is to get all the entire 'mythology' of Batman explained and broken down to it's bare bones, I go home after-wards feeling a bit stupefied, like some things are not obvious enough? Thus my vote becomes sort of low. This IS the second best Batman-flick, the first with Keaton-Nicholson - of course - being number one still. A comic-book-movie should have some black comedy to it - and also some of the self-sacks Burtons original Batman had. Nolan is a great director, but he should stick to mellow thrillers.",7,3,5,14 October 2005
Twilight," You have got to be kidding me!
","Well... I have not laughed this hard in a long time, so for that reason this movie earns a rating of 1/10 and not 0/10 (which it deserves for many reasons).What caused this laugh to almost make me faint was that scene where the vampires play baseball. Omfg! I... I... Just watch it. Geez.So, what is so bad about this movie (besides the obviousness of baseball-playing vampires)? To sum up: Everything. The acting could have been better done by a bunch of retarded, headless monkeys. The direction would have been better if the director would just have stayed of the freaking set all together. The music was clearly created in like 30 minutes (if that). Who edited this movie... I mean, come on!? The list goes on...Like that other guy wrote: This is a 2 hour photo shoot for Robert Pattinson (that pathetic excuse for an actor).This movie sends the wrong message to its target audience from second number one till the moment Robert Pattinson's name scrolls of the screen in the end credits. I hope he earns good money, because when the Twilight saga (sigh) is over, this guy will become dust...Alright. He might be saved by a talented director if he's really, really lucky to get a respectable one to work with him.I understand this is a fantasy-movie, but when it becomes all about glamor and fashion and looks and glittering skin (how pretentious is that unless this had been a movie about homosexual vampires; then I could have bought it) something tells me this world just got a little bit colder, darker, more cynical and generally more shallow.Just try to imagine The Lord of the Rings being created by these people with this style... Yeah, scary isn't it.Do yourself a favor: Don't see this movie (or if your life depends on it - like a torture-type-situation - do what I did: Download it! - don't pay these talentless people a freaking' cent). Go watch a brick wall, urinate on your neighbor's door, punch a baby in the face or set a forest on fire instead. It would do the world less harm.",1,8,120,6 June 2009
Avatar," A visual masterpiece; Same old, same old, story-wise
","I understood that this would not be 'Aliens' or 'Terminator'. I knew even without reading anything about this movie that this would basically be aimed at a younger audience.I can't blame Jim Cameron. He has been out of the game for a while so when returning to the stage, naturally he plays it safe and goes for a big time matinée that in every single category (and those are one) will please the guys in charge of finances (and it will... many times over).The good stuff: The CGI is nearly groundbreaking. I say 'nearly' because the concept of this film is so out of this world (literally) that a CGI element is unmistakable to recognize 99% of the time, and you always have this in the back of your head. They are still very, very nice, however. I love the colors, the concept of this imaginative world and the production design (even though at a few occasions I felt I was watching the Pride Parade). If you like fast-paced, eventful films (and I do, among many other types of films, having a very dynamic taste in motion pictures) this is a good film. Not super-good or even great; but just plain good. It entertains you for over 2½ hours, but not much more; I don't really feel breath-taken after having seen it in the cinema.The bad stuff: The story. I've seen it before. More than once. The references to contemporary American politics are a little bit too 'in your face' (although not as bad as the references to how bad racial problems are, in the movie 'Crash' for instance). The acting is mediocre; suitable more for video-game cut-scenes, but then again, of course, that is pretty much what they were shooting for I suppose. Another thing to remark on is that cinemas today is no better than a semi-cheap home-theater system. The sound is just louder. And in a cinema you have to sit with a hundred other people you don't know who makes noises and interrupts at times when they need to go to the bathroom... and then there is the annoying subtitles (in non-English theaters)... the loss of focus at times... etc. etc.My advice is: Buy a BD-player, A full-HD Plasma-TV (or LED) and a small, suitable home theater system and watch it at home. It won't cost that much, and it will be worth it over time. Then a movie can get the attention and quality it deserves.Anyway: You have to see this movie with the right sort of mind to really, really enjoy it. Had I been fifteen I would have loved it, the way I loved Jurassic Park when that came (a movie I rate about a 6 today but would have called at least a 9 back then). You have to think of this movie the way you would about a Disney Pixar movie, but with some real live elements in between the massive orgies of CGI splashed at you.I think of the visuals when I think back on it now. I think that when I purchase the Blue-ray late spring or whenever (and I will), I will buy it to see the visuals, and not at all for the story. It will basically be a fairly expensive screen-saver for my Plasma-TV. I pray that is not what Jim Cameron wanted it be and that his next feature will be far better written and developed in that regard...Summary: A stunning movie, visually. A mediocre movie story-wise. Does it deserve a place on IMDb's top250? Hell No! But there are plenty of movies there that does not belong there these days, right (after IMDb now being run by teenagers, basically)? When asked about this movie I would say: 'An OK adventure movie if you need to relax and no be too judgmental, wrapped in pretty CGI and decent production design. Don't watch this movie as an adult; watch it as a kid. And don't see it in the cinema; buy the Blue-ray and watch it in the controlled environment of your home.'",7,1,11,19 December 2009
Mr. & Mrs. Smith," A Pleasurable Trip
","I like modern action-movies, particularly since they often intermingle with other genres. In this case, comedy and romance. The real trick (which was the major problem during the 80's and 90's) is to make the genres mix seamless, like the action can't be without the comedy and the other way around.Mr. & Mrs. Smith succeeds in this. It is fun, fast and pleasant. So, the problem with it. I've never been a huge Jolie-fan. I feel she only found her true character-style in Girl Interrupted, but everything else is just wrong (especially the Lara Croft: Tom Raider-films, in which she really, really sucks). OK, she is not a disaster i Mr. & Mrs. Smith, but you can feel she is not having any fun.So the grade only reaches an average, and only because of this insanely overrated (both as an actress and as a beautiful? woman). But in all other departments this is a great film. I would have loved to have seen a more down-to-earth-woman in the role as Jane Smith. Brad Pitt (even though he happens to be a mega star, a hunk, a versatile big-time actor etc.) pulls off the 'average-guy-part'.",6,0,2,23 April 2006
War of the Worlds," Pressed out
","I didn't really expect to much, and I was right... There is something fundamentally missing from this film. The characters, and their development are horribly plain and worst of all; the ironic tone of the ending of the book, has been 'hollywood-ized' to the level that I could almost cry. Further more I didn't like the design of the tripods so much... I realize that the point was to make them look a little like comics from that time would have made them, but it feels pressed out.Okej, that's the bad things. The good things are equally many. First of the dark, apocalyptic mood is great. You don't see more then a few clips from the devastation round the world but still feel like it's a global attack. I like the special effects, and how they blend in so well with the hand-held camera, making it feel even a bit more realistic. Last, I really like Spielberg's lately dark-in-style films (ever since Saving Private Ryan, I guess) and he brings it a step further this time. All though; I feel through-out the movie, that the death and destruction has been slightly limited to pass for lower age-rating. Thats one of the things about todays movie industry that I so terribly wrong.All in all: this is an average kind of film. It's definitely worth seeing a couple of times, but I hope I get to see another version of the story before I die... maybe directed by Nolan or Fincher?",6,1,3,11 July 2005
Blade Runner," A Thing of Beauty
","This is my absolute favorite sci-fi movie ever. It's largely due to the beauty it renders. It's one of two, fantastic Scott-films, the other being (of course) Alien. This is one of those movies that keeps getting better each time you see it, and every time I watch it again, I get stunned over the special effects. It is absolutely breath-taking.As goes for the story, it couldn't be told better I think, and nor could it had been better casted. Ford an Young does a perfect performance, as do all the supporting roles. I just can't find anything about it to criticize. I love it, and really cannot understand those who give this masterpiece thumbs down! Well, in short: I get lyrical to the break of tears when viewing it. If you haven't seen it yet... run NOW, rent it, buy it or what ever and see it many times. You won't regret it! One of my top 10 films!",10,0,1,12 July 2005
