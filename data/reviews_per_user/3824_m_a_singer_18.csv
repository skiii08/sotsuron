Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," I got my money back
","This has to be the shortest length of time I've ever spent in a movie before knowing I was going to hate it - just under five minutes. It wasn't just that it was racist and offensive, because that's not necessarily bad. But it was damned ugly. Incompetently ugly. Shot by people who have no idea what anything should look like ugly. And the only thing that came across in that five minutes was Cohen's ridiculous accent and the completely inability of anyone connected with the film to write or stage something funny.I don't know who Cohen is, but based on this he is both supremely untalented and supremely clueless about... practically anything. I guess that's why so many people love this film - they're enjoying laughing at someone being such an unaware jerk. And it is making money, so I guess he'll get to do it again. Pity, that.",1,57,112,24 November 2006
The 13th Warrior," I wish it were better
","I'm honestly glad that some of what was in Crichton's book - like the Neanderthals - never made it to the screen. It's unfortunate that what did make it is pretty much nonsense. All of the Beowulf parallels are gone (they weren't very clear in the book, either), along with the personalities of most of the characters. The movie looks cheap and ugly, and things like the 'stand in a circle while they conveniently come at us from all sides in the round building' bit are just laughable. The action is pure slop; it seriously looks like no one bothered to stage it.The one bright spot is Dennis Storhøi, whose sharp intelligence and joking comradeship with Antonio Banderas' petulant Ahmed Ibn Fadlan actually breathes some life into this mess. It's too bad that the Norwegian Storhøi, who followed this up with a performance as George in _Who's Afraid of Virigina Woolf?_ that won the Norwegian Theatre Critics Award (Teaterkritikerprisen), will likely never get another chance at an English-language film. He's good (and Banderas is better when around him) - the film is not.(After writing this review, I read complaints from several of the other Scandinavian actors that scenes explaining who their characters were and exploring their world and relationship with each other as a 'band' were removed in favor of more 'action' material from the Chichton-directed re-shoot after original director John McTiernan was fired. That just makes this even more of a failure.)Update 7/16/2017: I've since watched this several times again, and each time I gain more respect for what the film could have been. I'd even say that the actors did such a good job of working together as a 'band' that their scenes survive the worst additions, like the laughable gore effects and the already-noted chaotic battle sequences.",7,0,2,4 July 2007
Forrest Gump," Keep your rotten chocolates
","I can't believe this insultingly stupid, trite, and flabby film was nominated for any awards. The film is simply meaningless, having no comprehensible point of view and unwilling to look one millimeter past the surface of any of the events it attempts to depict. Something like this is even more flatulent and offensive than action garbage like _ConAir_, which at least doesn't pretend to have Something To Say.The popularity of this movie escapes me completely. I guess it makes people feel good about themselves in some sick way: 'My life is bad, but lookie - this retarded man gets to interpret the highlights of American history and popular culture for me!' Hanks, who I normally like, seems to have based his performance on not blinking, or maybe he was just drugged (a rational response to the uber Hallmark Card that passes for a screenplay.) Wretched garbage appropriate for people scared of thinking.",2,26,59,1 May 2004
Watchmen," Mostly nice to look at
","I found the movie's attempt to match what I assume are the visuals of the source material to be attractive, and I really wanted to like the story's subtexts about such things as the nature of heroics and the shifting boundaries imperfectly separating courage from foolhardiness and cynicism from concern. In the end, though, it was hard to care too much about the film because so much of it was more or less tepidly silly. Even to the uninitiated (like me), the bad guy is clearly announced about halfway through, and his great master plan, once revealed, is one of those dumbfoundingly convoluted but stupid ideas that only works in bad fiction because a character has been given an absolutely impossible amount of resources and lucky breaks by authorial fiat in order to make it work.The acting doesn't help matters. Jackie Earle Haley is an interesting actor and Rorschach an interesting character, but Malin Akerman is simply awful and Matthew Goode and Patrick Wilson not much better. Having seen Billy Crudup in _Almost Famous_, I know he's a good actor who will likely recover from being in this, if for no other reason in that he is normally filmed in flesh tones and with pants. At least he has the grace to sound bored with his character's ridiculous dialog.Still, it looks nice, and Rorschach is entertaining (though why he would want to rely on the rest of these drips is lost on me).",4,9,18,22 March 2009
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Even better than I had hoped
","Rather than just filming the book, Peter jackson seems (though it is notpossible) to be telling the same story in his own way. This is an incredible film; even its weaknesses (one of which, unfortunately, is Lothlorien and Galadriel - the scenes simply don't work) are quickly forgiven in the sweep of the story.I've got to wait a full year for the next one? That hurts.",9,0,0,19 December 2001
The Thing," Incredibly revolting film
","I've only seen one other film that affected me as badly, and as permanently - Pasolini's 'Salo'. There, the film was revolting for a reason. Here, it is just revolting, badly written, and badly acted. Nothing but pure shock and gore and the most repulsive special effects I've ever seen. No story, stupid characters, and patently ridiculous. There are ways to be frightened, but this is about as entertaining as mutilating yourself.I swore when I saw it back at its release that if John Carpenter had been in the lobby of the theater, I would have punched him for making me feel so thoroughly disgusted. That still holds true. Whatever else good he may have done, I have never been able to have any respect for Carpenter after seeing this. He has talent beyond doubt, but this film also shows that he has a heart of pure shlock.I truly hate this movie, and I wish I had never seen it.",1,26,112,17 February 2001
Independence Day," The 'goofs' section doesn't tell the whole story...
","Never before have I seen a film with such grossly mismatched reverse angle shots - these clowns can't even handle a dialogue scene competently. Combine that with a level of implausibility that overwhelms within the first 20 minutes (gee, we not only don't evacuate the President with alien spaceships overhead and *leave his daughter to wander unsupervised around the White House*, but everyone and his dog can wander around Area 51 at will!), an oblivious disregard for it's own script (stealth bombers flying over an 'evaucated' city that conveniently left all of its lights on), and what appears to be a total lack of geographic knowledge, and this is one huge, stinking, stupid mess. How anyone can like or recommend this is beyond me. Jeff Goldblum and Will Smith do get a few points for their improvisational throwaways, though those stand out as they are the only lines in the film that sound like they were spoken by human beings. (And I've since found out that at least one joke in their 'spaceship sequence' was lifted from an old Warner Brothers Daffy Duck cartoon, which is probably why it stands out as good.)",1,8,15,2 January 2004
No Country for Old Men," The most disappointing Coen Brothers film I've seen
","I honestly can't tell what they were thinking when they did this. The script is a mess, full of afterthoughts and misfires and very short on any sort of actual point or significance. It just sputters along with stabs of pointless violence and splashes of awkward humor that are mostly based on casting ugly people and then making them sound stupid. The bad guy is Freddy Kruger with a Prince Valiant haircut, Tommy Lee Jones is wasted, Woody Harrelson is (pardon) wasted, a lot of really nice scenery is wasted. It isn't even particularly well shot despite the fact that it is the often-brilliant Roger Deakins. Joel and Ethan Coen have made two of my favorite films and others I have enjoyed, but this is just sadly wrong.",3,25,40,21 December 2007
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," It's not adaptation - it's bastardization
","I am bitterly disappointed by this film. It's noisy, jumbled, and chaotic, far too violent (it was a children's book, for heaven's sake!), and almost completely formless. The action sequences are just ridiculous, and what's worse is that they look fake - maybe an artifact of filming a 3D movie and then showing a 2D version, but something that you can't say of the LoTR movies. This was like a not very attractive cartoon.Morevoer, even as stuffed to the gills as it is with material from Tolkien's appendices to LoTR and other things that should make the world come alive and draw you in to the back story, much of it doesn't makes sense. It's just a blitz of portentous talking between fights and chases. The acting may not be all bad, but nobody's even on screen long enough to actually act or is given anything to *do*. Ian McKellen's Gandalf has become a caricature and his performance no more than a collection of tics and mannerisms. Sylvester McCoy is embarrassing. At least half the dwarfs aren't' given enough actual acting time to create characters, which just makes the film even more cartoon-like.Overall, watching The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey was about as much fun as watching someone play World of Warcraft. I hate to say it, but even as someone who has been a scholarly Tolkien geek for decades, I may not bother to see the moves that are to follow. I'm afraid that may be a rather common reaction, too. Oh, well - maybe it will turn people toward reading the book (and Tolkien's other work) to see what the fuss was really about.",2,123,200,26 December 2012
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," Peculiar
","I'm afraid that this movie left me cold. The acting is generally quite good - Michelle Yeoh's performance is excellent - though Chow Yun-Fat is surprisingly bland and uninvolved. The fight scenes are well correographed but ratherbland, and there's twice as much movie as story. The pace isn't so much slow as undistinguished; night and day seem haphazardly placed (not helped by the fact that so many nighttime scenes are shot on obvious sets.) Overall, the film is very careful, and much less interesting for it. Ang Lee has done, and will likely do, better films than this.",Null,0,0,3 December 2001
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," I hope Jackson hasn't painted himself into a corner
","I did not like this as much as I did 'The Fellowship of the Ring.' It looked like it was drastically edited at the last minute to meet time constraints, and some of the CGI/animation work was jarring. I'm still willing to give it a try on the 'special edition' DVD (where I assume that scenes will be added back.)
However, I get really nervous when I think about how *much* material still has to be covered. I'm also very concerned that some scenes in the first film that I think will be necessary to have the *last* scenes in 'Return of the King' make sense were deleted in the theatrical release. And if we have yet another dwarf-tossing joke in ROTK, I'm probably going to throw something at the screen.All that said, this is an amazing project, and even if flawed it is worth seeing. It's not #10 on anyone's all-time best list (not when there are films like 'Children of Paradise' and 'Andrei Rublev' out there)... but the complete trilogy may hit close to that mark. And the acting remains excellent.",8,0,0,5 July 2003
Moulin Rouge!," Smells like post-modernism.
","After 15 minutes of this DVD, I just gave up, went into anotherroom, and closed the door. I suppose that if this turns intosomething other than a bunch of expensively produced videos in ablender I will have missed it.. but, then again, no... ... it's just garbage - irritating, arch, self-important garbage.",Null,0,1,12 May 2002
Black Hawk Down," I walked out
","Maybe it got better after the first 30 minutes... I don't care enough to find out. What I saw in that time was inappropriately 'pretty' photography matched with incomprehensible dialog (in fairness, the sound system of the theater where I saw it could have have been responsible for my understanding only one out ofevery three words, but I doubt it was responsible for each of those words being part of a cliche) and characters all cut with the same dull cookie cutter. After this, 'Blade Runner,' and 'Black Rain' I've decided that Ridley Scott is one of the most overrated directors of the past 30 years. More power to everyone that loved this - I thought it was an pretentious mess.",2,2,6,25 January 2002
The Artist," O.K. if you've never seen another movie before.
","Why are people gushing over this? It is nothing but a barely competent collection of the clichés that people think of when they think of a 'silent movie' but really are ones that mark third-rate commercial entertainment, which this is. It's thin, it's badly acted, and it's *wrongly* shot. If you're going to ape your betters (which in this case would include Pabst, von Stroheim, Murnau, Lubitsch, and Chaplin), then you should have the decency to study what they do and try to imitate their style. This is crap. I'd like to believe the acclaim for it is a joke, but I fear it's not. I guess people don't watch things like 'City Lights' any more and don't recognize this for the pandering garbage it is. And it *is* pandering; never for one frame do you get the feeling that these people don't think they're archly 'slumming' and being 'edgy' by shooting without sound despite the fact that their vision is utterly pedestrian and probably wouldn't have made it off the second bill in 1928.Oh, and they use 'Pennies from Heaven' with no awareness whatsoever of its resonance. I hope Dennis Potter comes back from the great beyond and smacks them on the head.",2,16,29,18 February 2012
A Clockwork Orange," Not Kubrick's best
","I'm afraid that 'A Clockwork Orange' doesn't hold up as well for me now, nearly 10 years after I last saw it. It's very talky (not dialogue but narration, which rarely works), the compositions are overly formal and static, and Malcom McDowell'sperformance is not nearly as impressive now that I've see 'O Lucky Man!'.Worse, Burgess's language sounds much too stilted, and his story is simplistic. While the film still makes it as a black comedy, it's simply not as funny as 'Dr. Strangelove'; I get the feeling that Kubrick had no sympathy for the material's moralistic tone.Of course, that criticism is made in light of Kubrick's early masterpieces and his later, mature works. I am convinced that 'Strangelove,' '2001,' and, yes (and especially), 'Eyes Wide Shut' are masterpieces, and I think that Kubrick'sformalism and abstraction matured into a powerful narrative and intellectualforce after this film. 'A Clockwork Orange,' though, is neither as deep nor as evocative as I remembered; maybe it's just not as timeless as those others.",9,0,0,24 July 2003
Con Air," If you know it's stupid, does that make it o.k.?
","While the comic one-liners liberally quoted (and misquoted) in the other reviews stay in mind, this film is a rancid hash of cliches put together by people who can't construct a screenplay or edit a sequence so that it is within wavingdistance of logic. Nicholas Cage may have been a good actor at one time, butafter seeing him in this and in 'Adaptation' (where he seems to think that adifferent shirt is a different characterization), I'm not so sure. If there's anything going on inside him, it's not reaching his face and it's sure not reaching his audience. Everyone else gives up and chews the scenery, and Steve Buscemi has thegrace to look embarrassed. (Would someone please give this guy a role wherehe *doesn't* have to play a creep? See 'Parting Glances' if you can find it to get an idea of what his range would be like if some casing agent had imagination.) This is a waste of everyone involved, except for the hacks producing, writing, and directing this mess and for Cage, who is starting to look like he deserves it.",Null,0,0,9 June 2003
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," A few things overlooked
","Well, I think I said in my review of TTT that I was afraid that Jackson and company wouldn't be able to fit in all that was left. Now, though I have not seen the extended cut (longer than the cut of _Napoleon_, I believe!), it looks like they added much of it back there.As a Tolkien geek of 30+ years I was greatly impressed by these films even though I miss much of the subtlety of the book itself. However, that subtlety is not entirely lost; instead, it is often taken up in the acting. Bernard Hill and Miranda Otto actually make *more* of their characters than the books do. All of the Hobbits are fine, Andy Serkis is better than fine, and Ian Holm, bless him, gives all the young ones lessons in sly scene stealing. Ian McKellen is a bit too subdued at times, but when he hits the mark he's very powerful. Elves are basically impossible to play, but all of the actors in those roles do well even if Orlando Bloom is a bit callow.The revelation throughout all three films, though, is Viggo Mortensen. I hated him immediately upon his entrance in the first film, then quickly started to reassess as the film moved on. I quickly realized that he managed to hit every single one of even the deepest notes of the character, a man who is not only skilled beyond his first appearance but whose nature as a hero and a king is based in millennia of history and inheritance. It is an amazing performance, one of the best I have ever seen, and so strong that even though the end of the film was naturally without him I missed his character, just as I do every time I read the book.So, enjoy the CGI. But watch the acting - that's where you'll get the depth of the tale.",9,5,10,18 December 2004
Braveheart," Unwatchable
","Simply one of the worst movies I've ever seen, and one of the few I couldn't even finish. After five minutes, my partner and I began to mutter to ourselves about the sloppy editing, ridiculous dialogue, and wretched performances (it's probably best not to cast child actors who can't control their facial muscles). At ten minutes, mutters had become outraged snorts and laughter - couldn't the editor have even *tried* to sync the piper's fingers with the terribly unrealistic pipe music? At 15, right after he said, 'Look! It's the ghost of Basil Rathbone!', we turned it off, figuring that if they didn't have the sense to edit out the crap by that point (admittedly, by then eliminating what sucked would have involved a totally different script, editor, and actors, and about 12 minutes less film), they never would.",Null,3,7,14 July 2001
