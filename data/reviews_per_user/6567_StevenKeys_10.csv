Casablanca," Casablanca
","A 2nd-rate melodrama and promotion-film whose lasting power is only exceeded by Coca-Cola's famous sales slogan, 'the pause that refreshes (29).'Highly-hyped since it premiered in November of 1942 (Hollywood), less than two months prior to the first-rate Allied powers conference held in Casablanca, Morocco in January of 1943 ('unconditional surrender' decree), then in national release one day prior to the meeting's end (1.23.43). Now how's that for a go-getter public-relations department? Yet, it is the perfect Classic for the new millennium as its greatness lies not in its story or any real sentiment but its still sizable celebrity.Not only is Blanca a bad romance, it's a bad war film, too. To think that Ilsa (Ingrid) would even consider leaving her husband, the tall, handsome, brave Czech Allied operative, Victor (Henreid), for the older, bow-tie wearing, bar-owner Rick (Bogart), hits the height of implausibility, though, Laszlo may run a bit short himself in the smarts department, leading an oddly-timed rendition of La Marseillaise in the Cafe, even as he tries to stay one step ahead of the Nazi thugs. But that Lund does flirt with infidelity in such circumstance makes a mockery of any claim at sentiment and romantic worth.To the film's war image, that Blaine, supposedly a former a freedom-fighter (Spanish Civil War) and gun-runner (Ethiopia), has decided to sit out the Big One (WW2) is hard to figure. Just as hard to appreciate is Rick's chummy relationship with the local Vichy authority in Renault (Rains), a position which in any reality would've had the prefect putting countless Allies and innocents into the clutches of the SS (Veidt), but has now decided to risk it all for his Yankee pal on a spontaneous infusion of conscience? C'mon.But more disappointing than the story and script (Renault: 'I'm shocked, shocked to find there's gambling going on in here!') (oy), is that I admire so many of the artists involved in the cooking of this over-baked ham. A cavalcade of Classic greats in leads Bogart (The-Haves African-Queen), Bergman (Gaslight) & Henreid (Now-Voyager), characters Veidt (Dark-Journey), Rains (Invisible-Man LoA), Lorre (M), Qualen (Grapes), Greenstreet (Maltese-Falcon), Sakall (YDD Summertime), Dalio (La-Grande-Illusion), Dantine, Page, LeBeau, Steiner, Wallis produced and director Curtiz who developed so many stars in films like Noahs-Ark The-Adventures-Of-Robin-Hood Mildred-Pierce Yankee-Doodle-Dandy The-Breaking-Point Trouble-Along-the-Way, just to name a few. Under-utilization of great talent was never so apparent.The clincher: Had Woody Allen not revived interest in the film on Play-It-Again-Sam (72), it may've settled into a more fitting state. According to TCM host Robert Osborne, two of its three leads in Henreid and Bergman, both who'd out-lived co-star Bogart (d.57) and were afforded time for reflection, had expressed 'surprise' at the great acclaim that continued to heap upon the picture. Like Meatloaf sang, 'two outta' three ain't bad,' but this movie surely is .. bad, haughty AFI rank notwithstanding (2/4).",3,0,4,24 February 2020
12 Angry Men," 12 Angry Men
","Rose - Lumet's high theater on attitudes that often bedevil jury deliberation: Sloth (J7) and prejudice (10) are well-known, but also bias (Fonda (8) acting as defense co-counsel in creating unreasonable doubts and effectively stopping his co-jurors from further reflection to push the group-think as Cobb (3) had done earlier) and the struggle all jurors should engage by being objective while ultimately forming a conviction.The men first appear, eleven, anyway, too quick to convict, then fall like dominos, too easy to acquit, running hot or cold, acceding to whichever advocate (J3 or 8) has his air-of-authority turned on high. It's a trying watch in grade below Lumet's 1982 gem, The-Verdict (wtih jurors Warden & Binns), that opens with a mawkish camera pan to beg our sympathy for a defendant of whom we know nothing, and ends by leaving the impartial viewer feeling that maybe justice was not done after-all. But there's plenty of passion with the power to make us think, and that's always a plus.And it's worth keeping this in mind when watching and being moved to-and-fro by the passions at play: It's fair to judge the personalities of the 12 jurors, to a point, and the workings of their deliberations, but their value as such and any vote they render either early or late in the process is completely within their own purview as they in the story sat through the trial and we the viewers did not, excepting the judge's flat closing instruction. It might then be wise to not vest heavily on the guilt question (2.5/4).",5,0,1,30 April 2020
Malcolm X," Malcolm X
","So concerned with making a powerful movie are some directors, they disdain the making of an entertaining one. Charming moments will imbue both players and message with a trust that viewers embrace and then recall with warmth for years to come. The best freedom epics are peppered with such moments (In-the-Heat-of-the-Night Lawrence-of-Arabia The-Adventures-of-Robin-Hood 1970-New-York-Knicks). Had Mr. Lee this in mind, Malcolm-X may've pleased more (2.5/4) (4.2.20).",5,0,1,2 April 2020
Cross of Iron," Cross of Iron
","It is 1943 on Taman Peninsula in Russia with the invading German army now in retreat. James Mason (Col Brandt) is the pragmatic regimental commander, David Warner (Cpt Kiesel) his cynical, war-weary adjutant, Max Schell (Cpt Stransky) a naive but by-the-book Prussian blue-blood who's determined to win metallic glory by hook or by crook, and James Coburn (Sgt Steiner) the ultra anti-hero (Elias & Barnes) who holds what his new Captain so desperately wants but lacks wherewithal to win: The Iron Cross.It's an odd thing to find yourself rooting for the Germans (No apparent Nazis are present, but no surprise there, with the rank & file soldiers in the midst of battle) and laugh at Stransky's incompetence, the Clouseau of the Crimean ('The phone is ringing!!') while death swings its sickle through the bunkers with an eager ease.Fully out-fitted with the standard Sam Peckinpah blood & guts, but this time strewn with ribbons of sentiment (Co-written by Julius Epstein who shared an Oscar doing the same on Casablanca). You'll cry, then you'll cry again, realizing only the insignia (those who kept them visible) separate most of these soldiers from any other who've endured the hells of War. So, here's to 'surviving (4/4) (1.12.20).'",9,0,0,13 January 2020
Gone with the Wind," Gone with the Wind
","Margaret (b.Atlanta) found a porcelain pin amongst the post-War rubble, cleaned it, set it on the mantel, began to dreaming, put it to words and called it Gone-With-The-Wind.What do you write about a 4-hr epic showcasing maybe the most beguiling leading lady (Leigh), commanding lead man (Gable), charming characters (Melanie & Mammy) in arguably the best film ever made? Whatever it is, you keep it under 3000 words.If you are of the politically-correct persuasion, have feelings easily hurt or think the Classics are just so much cinema snooze, don't bother watching. But if you have a warm heart, like it tugged on a bit, understand historical context, know the difference between a documentary and a movie, you'll find the time needed to drink-in this sweeping, familial Civil War drama is very well spent.It's clearly Scarlett's movie but it's the meaning of the Ashley character that makes it one of the most curious. Leslie Howard (d.43) had balked at playing the hesitant Wilkes who may be Mitchell's nod to Lee: Learned men clinging to a corrupt code of honor who struggle with divided loyalties, choosing state (VA) over nation (USA), Wilkes engaging the additional battle of love (Melanie) versus passion (Scarlett).Those today with a hidden agenda will have you believe in the absurd, that Producer Selznick, he of Jewish heritage, sought to sentimentalize or make monument to the CSA and slavery. The plain truth, easy enough to see by those who watch film with an eye for entertainment and art, is that David O, along with directors Fleming & Cukor, elaborately portray the pain of life and circumstance, a treatment for which the pharmacology industry holds no monopoly of patents but for which movies offer some relief.And if you've a boycott bee in your bonnet, consider, when Rhett and Mams mix n' mingle over bourbons (2 hours in), the makers are firing one of the early shots for Civil-Rights. Does Gone-With-The-Wind romanticize events? Of course it does ('Cavaliers'), and that's why it's called cinema (4/4) (2.24.20).",10,3,4,24 February 2020

","Why some reviews will post at Internet Movie Database while others will not is only for 'team' members to know, a membership that's nearly impossible to contact. Mine did not post for this film, so if you'd like to read what I think of it, you can find my thoughts at Google, until that group decides to scrap fan reviews. You won't read anything offensive or violative of policy in its expression, leaving only difference-of-opinion with one or more 'staff' at IMDb as the likely reason for review exclusion, and just that by itself should make it worth a gander, and this site, seeming more like a club.",4,0,0,2 May 2020

","The classic quandary: One gorgeous melody (Kelly's song & rain-dance), one funny, incredible routine (O'Connor's 'Make 'Em Laugh') and one sweet l'il song in Deb Reynold's 'Good Morning,' but besides those memorables, Singin-in-the-Rain (2/4) has the worst off-key opener in film and proves to be no more than smart-aleck's delight, mocking the Silent era for cheap laughs, usually on the bad, fake Brooklyn accent of beautiful and talented Jean Hagen (Doll in Huston's Asphalt-Jungle) and Millard Mitchell who shoulda stayed on the range (High-Spade in Mann's Winchester73).The BIG numbers had better be perfect with Gene spending months getting each raindrop to fall right and Don likely devoting as much time climbing the walls. But the best musicals go beyond their numbers. They subtract the silly and pseudo sex to add serious sentiment to the equation and I just don't like K&D's arithmetic in what was in 1952 no masterpiece but has oddly become the best thing since buttered popcorn.Someone once wrote, 'the pen is mightier than the sword,' and that would figure, coming from a scribe (ahem), but what they failed to factor in is a state that is mightier than both combined: The status-quo. There are so many joyous movie musicals, Oliver (68), Gigi (59), Swing-Time (36), The-Sound-of-Music (65), just to name a very few. That the AFI ranks Singin the #1 musical all-time, only shows the Cmte has many, many more Classic films to view, if they can put their phones down long enough to engage (oy).If you want to see a super cinema from director Stan Donen, seek out his Charade (63) (4/4). No song or dance but your heart will be spinning all day long.",4,0,0,30 April 2020

","I'll cry twenty times but warm with laughter and glee double that number in the 2+ hours that make up director Frank Capra's joyous tale of heaven, humanity and hope.A secular man (Stewart) who is all things to all people in his little part of the world is visited by a major misfortune, leading him to what he thinks is the end of his tether. But a rare prayer is answered by an under-achieving angel (Travers) who grants his wish in that he never be born, giving him the 'gift' as witness to the void a good man's absence will leave in the lives of the people he knew and loved.Though merry for much of its length and seen today as the ultimate classic holiday film favorite, it does have its frightening frames (the misfortune involves a criminal mislay of money and ensuing panic), aided by noir-like camera (Walker & Biroc) and Dimitri Tiomkin's terrific score, all making this vintage TV fan feel certain that Rod Serling of The-Twilight-Zone fame must've enjoyed this film, too.The supporting cast have become character standards: Donna Reed (Mary) is the dream wife, pretty, intuitive and supportive when the chips are down; Bond & Faylen as cop and cabbie Bert & Ernie, most loyal of friends; Bondi & Hinds are the wisest of Moms and Pops; Gloria Grahame (Violet) as the Town flapper who's too hot to handle but too vivacious to turn away, and the great Lionel Barrymore is the ultimate antagonist in Mr. Potter, as miserly as Dickens' Mr. Scrooge but alot more fun to watch.If you don't likes B&W films, don't engage this one. It's very black & white. But if you love movies, art in all color combos and require that sentiment be a part of your life, this one's for you (4/4) (4.7.20).",10,0,0,8 April 2020

","I suspect there were many disappointed KD fans exiting the theaters on opening Xmas nite, 1957. While its message on callous command in war is important, Kubrick neglected the first Rule in film making (Bacon): You must make a movie people want to watch, i.e., you must service the public's need for entertainment (See; Platoon Das-Boot All-Quiet-On-the-Western-Front Cross-of-Iron The-Deer-Hunter).

Contact," Contact
","What could've been a four-star film, instead devolves into a unexpected character reversal and placating of religious and secular viewer both ('We're not alone') in a misguided attempt to please everyone but should please no one.For nearly its entirety (150m), Contact is a bold, engaging tale of interstellar messaging (Vega) with its protagonist, Dr Ellie Arroway (Foster), giving one of filmdom's great speeches in her passion plea for 'just the slightest bit of vision' from would-be sponsor, HR-Hadden, a John Hurt performance that should've nabbed him an Oscar (one nom: Best Sound). But in the final ten climactic minutes as Ellie testifies about her space trip in front of a hostile Senate which seems beset with a collective amnesia, forgetting the tsunami in science-bending advances that enabled construction of her machine, one riding on existitng Einsteinian theory (worm-holes), its '10,000' Alien-provided blueprints no Earthling, not even a filthy rich one, could've forged in secret, yet, our heroine completely unravels under what should've been easily handled, cynical questions (most from Sen James Woods who might've received a nom himself) in an over-done show of emotion that completely conflicts with the strong-willed, spirited scientist-turned-space-traveler we'd come to cheer ('No evidence!' As if the Greys are handing out souvenir key-chains and moon-rocks to their Contactees) (oy). When your boyfriend (McConaughey), as cool a dude as he be, becomes your only booster, someone in the script department surely lost their writing compass.I like a good love story. Contact has a good love story. But the central topic (planetary coupling) is too big for producers to've projected in half-measure. Director Zemeckis and the WB Suits & Skirts erred in what appears a cave to fears of a status-quo backlash when they seriously deviated from Sagan's novel by dumbing-it-down to implausibility (Senate snobs), maybe to intensify the love (Ellie & Palmer), most likely to placate inter-galactic isolationists, i.e., god-fearing folk who worship for many reasons, though, the 'pursuit of truth' could hardly be called one of them, Mr.Joss (3.5/4).For a film which projects much better the hope that religion ('faith') and science can, not only co-exist but work in harmony, watch Paramount's 1953 Technicolor adaptation of H. G. Wells 1898 novel, The-War-of-the-Worlds (4/4).",8,0,0,5 July 2020
