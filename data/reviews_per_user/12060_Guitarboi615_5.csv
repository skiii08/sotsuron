The Sound of Music," The Greatest Musical
","This movie is by far the best musical I've ever seen. I've seen this movie over and over and over again. The songs are legendary you're bound to have heard at least one of them if you haven't watched this movie. The songs are so catchy and the rhythm makes you want to dance and sing a long with the movie.Summary: This movie isn't just a musical, but it's also a love story, and a little suspense in the settings. I don't want to spoil ANYTHING, but the time setting is during WWII with Nazism. There is a little suspense, but it's mostly a love/musical story. If you classical catchy tunes, this is the movie to watch. I for one love watching this movie and I still watch it.",10,1,8,12 April 2005
Kickboxer," Very Good Movie, but not he best
","Kick boxer was a good movie, but to me not the best. The story line was what I thought very good. The way Kurt (Jean Claude) trains in the movie is very inspirational. It reflects on the way ancient warriors trained. I thought this movie would have more fighting but there are only like 4-5 fight scenes. I've seen this movie about 5 times since I think it's good, but if you just like the fight scenes, you shouldn't buy it, but maybe rent it.Plot: Eric (Kurts brother) thinks he's the best kick boxer in the world. Overall, the best fighter in the world. He brags non-stop about how good he is and he just wants to prove it. A reporter suggests he goes to Bangkok where kick boxing originated. There, his brother learns a lesson (Don't want to spoil anything) in which makes Kurt want to get revenge.Overall: Very good movie, but not his best. If you like fight scenes I suggest you watch Van Damme in his movie Bloodsport. This movie didn't have as much fights, but was very inspiring the way they express Muay Thai (fighting style they use).",8,4,6,11 April 2005
Pearl Harbor," Amazing Drama
","Purely a great drama movie.If you are expecting an action movie, don't expect too much. There are several parts where there are bombs flying, guns shooting, missiles flaring, but for the record, this movie is a drama. In my opinion one of the best. You'd think of it as a classic love story, two people in love, the man going to war, but this love story is totally different. It's more about one love, then splitting up into two. Kind of confusing, but once you watch it, you'll understand. If you like dramas, this is a must see movie. A lot of guys out there should be careful. I know a lot of my friends (guys) didn't like this movie very much at all. Only the parts with the gun firing and the bombings but besides that they thought it was a total chick flick, which it is. But if you like drama chick flick movies, this is THE movie to watch. This movie is truly one of THE saddest movie I've ever seen.",10,2,6,12 April 2005
A Walk to Remember," A Movie To Remember
","GREAT MOVIE. I have to say I love this movie. I am indeed a guy and I know it is weird a guy would say this but this movie really made me think. This is what guys would call a 'Chick Flick', a drama movie, like a classic love story. I love all different types of movies and this HAS to be my favorite drama of all time.Summary: Landon, the main character is a so called 'popular' kid at school. Like other popular people he always thinks about 'cool' things. Jamie Sullivan (Mandy Moore), changes that by opening his eyes more. This is great movie. It will touch you in a way you've never been touched before. Better than any classic love story. After you see this movie once, you'll want to see it again. And again.Overall: This is overall one of my favorite movies. I normally don't like dramas that much, but this one made me change my mind. It really has emotion and a great love story. This is a MUST SEE if you like drama movies.",10,1,2,11 April 2005
Goodfellas," Wanna Be a Wise guy?
","One of the best Mafia movies I've ever seen. This and The Godfather are movies I must recommend if you like gangsters, wise guys, etc. This movie is actually based on a true story. The real Henry Hill, who is the main star of this movie, actually said it was at least 90% true. He than said it was probably 98% accurate. This movie expresses a lot of the gangster ways and how they really did things.Summary: This is pretty much a biography on Henry Hill, who as a kid always wanted to be a gangster, and he actually worked for them. It shows how a young kid grew up helping the mafia and becoming a mobster himself. This is a true story and really shows what being a wise guy is all about.Overall: Definitely a 10/10 movie. Really makes me want to be a wiseguy.",10,178,342,12 April 2005
