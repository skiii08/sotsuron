Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Mixed mind
","Where i want to say the big movie version was better than his T.V show, i'm truly torn, i love the T.V show because you know that its real and these people are being set up, and it shows how bigoted and stupid they are. But the big screen version is better than 95% of the movies i've seen this year, except for little miss sunshine.But the scenes that do look a bit fake are in fact hilarious (Pamela Anderson, The dinner, The Dumbass frat-boys, and the Naked Wrestling)For someone that know nothing about Borat, this is gonna be either a shock or the funniest thing you've ever seen. But for us that have seen it before, it'll be slightly disappointing, but we'll get over it!!!!Die hard fans may be disappointed, but it is definitely worth the price of the ticket and the sore ribs after-wards!!",8,3,8,15 November 2006
