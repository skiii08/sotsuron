50 First Dates," Sandler learns to act
","I wasn't going to comment on this film, but having voted (in the daily vote segment) for 'your favourite Adam Sandler movie' and seeing how poorly '50' polled - well, I just couldn't resist the temptation. Sandler, on screen, often projects a goofy character immersed in slapstick. Sometimes the character works; most often it doesn't. I love 'The Wedding Singer' but feel that it indicated that there was more to come from Sandler. 'Happy Gilmore', well... A feel-good movie with ridiculous caricatures within a ridiculous plot. '50', however, shows an actor apparently comfortable with, and in charge of, a sensitive portrayal. The premiss of the film is much that of 'Groundhog Day' but original in its portrayal of problems which, later in life, are associated with Altzheimer's Disease. Living each day as if it is one's first is poignantly shown in the closing scenes. Life has passed regardless of its memories. And each day contains its own amazing happenings. Each day should be lived for its own sake.Perhaps this is why I like '50 First Dates' so much. 'Yesterday is history / Tomorrow a mystery / But today is a present.' Sandler presents a character so much in love that he overcomes the perceived familial need to keep his love in an eternal cocoon - eternally locked inside a day that all around her will do everything to protect and thus preserve. Time however, is insatiable: it is a gaping maw which sucks us all into the ageing process. Love is all, love is you.",7,0,0,16 August 2004
Chinatown," Water Wheels!
","Polanski has always directed uneven and sometimes disappointing movies.Having said that, this writer revisited 'Chinatown' almost thirty-three years after its release and found it good. In fact, found it excellent! Visually stunning (as an auteur's films should be) 'Chinatown' is also a period-piece which would make the BBC proud: it reeks of purity. The costumes, cars, offices are SO accurate that it makes one want to weep. Of course, it is OUR vision of what LA was/should be. And so it goes.Nicholson is pre-'Satanic'-eyebrows, and 'La Faye' simply stunning. Polanski's conceit of using John Huston in a key role takes one's breath away: Huston is presented as an 'eminence gris', the power behind the throne, as he was in real life.Satisfying and a brilliant nod (and wink) to the 'forties films noir. Oooh, gonna watch it again... 10/10.",10,0,1,23 April 2007
Dawn of the Dead," A remake as enjoyable as the original?
","The horror genre is, at times, a contentious mix of everything from the sublime to the ridiculous. I know that's a well-worn clich√©, but it is true perhaps more for this genre than for others. Audiences will often stay away in droves and consign otherwise good movies to cult status simply because they ARE remakes: indeed, often just because they are classified as horror. And let's face it - some remakes are woeful; some horror flix miss the point that INTENTIONAL humour and INTENTIONAL textual references add to the enjoyment. Even irony gets lost in the drive to be as gory as possible. The suspension of disbelief is made easier if there is at least a semblance of plot line and, in these days of fear re the use of biochemical and bacteriological weapons by terrorists, any film using same NEEDS humour to ensure the audience doesn't go home and commit mass suicide.Dawn of the Dead (2004) is one of the best remakes ever. Zack Snyder has created something new - a juxtaposition, if you will, between the original screenplay, new editing techniques, and a fresh, vibrant cast.Who is Sarah Polley? She gives a great performance as Ana. Ving Rhames is excellent as is Michael Kelly as CJ. Overall, an inspired casting of all the characters. We really FEEL for all of them and thus get 'sucked-in' to engage with each. What happens to them means something.The cinematography is excellent. Perhaps my only criticism would be the lack of unusual perspectives, i.e. unusual camera angles. This, of course, is more to do with costing than intent. One can only do so much within the strictures established by the bean-counters. However, Snyder and crew do a bloody-good job. (Pun intended.)It is interesting, to say the least, that the dog becomes a central part of both the action and the pathos.Sorry. There's a huge thunderstorm overhead and I don't want to fry the computer or the phone. More to follow...Paul",8,0,0,25 October 2004
Alien: Resurrection," Is a clone still the original? Does it/her/him share a common humanity?
","In some ways, 'Resurrection' is a logical fourth episode in the sequence: the trilogy has become a tetralogy. What SHOULD be considered (apart from the obvious need by the franchise to make more money) is that the Ripley character IS NOT THE SAME Ripley we saw in the first three.Ripley has been a constantly changing/evolving character. Within the 'original' trilogy, she has developed from the competent officer on a company ship, via a protective mother-figure, into a militant protector of humanity and, perhaps, beyond. Resurrection puts this much-loved, fiercely-protective character, into a situation where SHE is the controller. But who are we talking about? It/she is the end result of generations of experimentation: of an attempt to create a hybrid alien/human.Perhaps, the underlying message is that scientists cannot cage their creations, indeed, cannot control and/or understand them.The introduction of the 'mercenary crew' underlines this notion. Ripley has become an 'alien' complete with the 'attitude' the entity 'Ripley' has apparently always had.When, accompanied by the 'new' humans, she discovers her lab-bound predecessors, (complete with 'kill me' dialogue), the realisation that we are only shown a small percentage of the 'failures' is, perhaps, accompanied by the notion that she has every reason to kill ALL the research scientists.As a mother-figure to the aliens, who have, possibly, become more HUMAN, the hybrid clone (Ripley) still can't overcome her loathing of this invasive, destructive life-form.Whilst not the insect-based supermom, the Ripley hybrid surely offers us the luxury of feeling empathy for ALL mothers, regardless of species.There are subtexts within subtexts. Still, I could be overreacting. Damnit - it deserves better than some of the featured critiques.Watch Alien: Resurrection and make up your own mind. I did.",7,1,2,25 October 2005
Silent Hill," Ahhh... An intelligent and captivating horror movie!
","I came to this film without knowing the history behind its making: I am very glad this was the case. Had I known it is based on a game, I may not have even looked for Silent Hill at all. After all, most adaptations from games to screen are dodgy to say the least. I don't know what the game is like, but the film is sensational! Silent Hill has pretty-much anything one could wish for in a horror flick: great direction; excellent editing; and a wonderful cast. Alice Krieg plays Christabella to the hilt, and references to her 'Borg Queen', especially toward the denouement, abound. Jodelle Ferland as Sharon/Alessa proves she is an adaptable actor who should get better by the role/year! And the list goes on...Everywhere, there are allusions and references for the fans among us: 'Midwich' makes an appearance and there is more than a touch of the original 'Kingdom' (rather than King's adaptation) floating about. We have: the isolated community; the government (in this case local) conspiracy; the hypocrisy of sectarian religion/cults; the strong bond between mother and child; and the father-figure out of his depth.I'm avoiding ANY hints re the story/action because it is so good that it must be experienced first-hand. Rent the DVD or buy it. I'm certainly going to watch it a few more times, and I bet you will too. Yes, it's THAT good! Now, I suppose, I'd better go find someone who's played the game...",9,1,3,7 December 2006
Top Secret!," Val as a 60s rock star?
","The 'spoof' movie has become a staple example of what is wrong with 'Holywood' per se. Written, produced and directed by the Zucker team, it is, regardless of intent, wonderfully funny: if one understands the references and is prepared to suspend belief.Val Kilmer (at least in this role) is wonderful. One can see why he was chosen to portray 'The Lizard King': Jim Morrison (Morisson - spelling?).Regardless of the somewhat crass one-liners, Kilmer IS a 50s maybe 60s Beachboy clone.The notion of clay-pigeon shooting combined with surfing: 'Skeet Surfing - USA', really sets the mood for the rest of the movie.And so it goes. The Wall is gone: unfortunately, wannabe rockstars are not. Still, it's a lot of fun.",7,1,2,8 April 2005
Fargo," The Compleat Coen
","Fargo is a film wherein the expertise of the Coen brothers creates gold!ALL their films are excellent, especially The Great Lebowski and O, Brother Where Art Thou.The Coens are adept at assembling excellent casts: ensembles if you will. But Fargo, of all their movies, has a magic element: if one ignores those amazingly white settings, the dialogue and characters would sing upon a stage. There is a constant flow, even through the 'car salesman' scenes which carries us into the home: to the seemingly neurotic wife and the (always) oppressive father-in-law. Dare one indicate that the script owes much to European theatre? Well, yes.Part of the charm (and one should accept that this is an EXTREMELY black comedy) revolves around the (almost) patois spoken. Oh, ja? OK. MOST of the charm, however, is based around Marge (Frances McDormand), a very pregnant Police Chief who has a mind like a steel-trap! Given that (at least for the males not within her immediate sphere of influence) her femininity and pregnancy would seem to detract from her investigation, she carries all before her. Marge Gunderson is a wonderful role model. What an irony that McDormand won 'best actress', in as much as her character was up against such powerful opposition. Still, I think the best irony was that her husband appeared to be a non-entity (although amazingly supportive - breakfasts, putting up with her snoring, and always a comforting arm) who, at the end of the film, proved to be a success in his own right.OK. I waxed lyrical. Macey, Buscemi and Stormare complete what is, essentially, a working ensemble. Is this good? You betcha!",9,1,1,15 August 2005
Duck Soup," I Think The Fly Is Doing The Backstroke - 'Duck! It's in the Soup!'
","Perhaps I've become jaded after too many M*A*S*H repeats - those with Alda doing Groucho - but I just viewed the DVD after a loooong break from Marx Brothers' movies and wasn't impressed.1933 was an interesting year for political satire but, as another commentator has pointed-out, Duck Soup is more a vehicle for standard Marx Bros routines than it is for incisive political commentary.I'm disappointed that it only made #85 on the AFI's top 100 movies, but not surprised. The free-wheeling plot is just a device to link their zany and irrelevant routines, and other movies far surpass this one; most of the other 'Marxist' comedies for instance. I think the highlight, for me, was Groucho's quick-change outfits in 'the bunker'. Given Margaret Dumont's wonderfully understated yet ditzy performance, that says a lot.Harpo is a delight (as always) but Chico seems flat - just going through the motions. Hmmm... perhaps Zeppo needed more exposure than he is given here.It's hard to discuss this film without including spoilers: after all, the routines are what it's all about. Still, yer pays yer money...A Night at The Opera might just be better as an intro to the Bros. All in all, however, it IS just a matter of taste. I wonder what a mess-of-pottage any attempt to REMAKE this comedy (and goodness knows THAT'S on the cards) would be! Still... Johnny Depp as Groucho? Brrrrr.",6,4,6,27 September 2005
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," School Daze and Knowledge
","Rowling's books, given their references to: English boarding schools; the problems of life in (apparently mundane and, at times, abusive) suburban and middle-class English life; the acquisition of knowledge regardless of cost; the shifting and unreliable input of adults per se; and, surely, the need for a child to believe in the sanctity of missing parent(s), were always going to be problematic when transferred to the 'big/silver screen'.Well, three films later, Alfonso Cuaron (sorry about the lack of diacritical mark) has fulfilled the promise! There has ever been a darker side to the texts and, finally, it has come to the fore. Cuaron has not lost the thread of the first two episodes - rather he has added to what at the moment, promises to become a remarkable teratology. And, of course, there is more to come from Rowling's pen.Steven Kloves has written a superb screenplay. The CGI and cinematography are, as usual, excellent: as is the casting.On a different note, there is, perhaps, too little attention given to the subtexts contained within Rowling's work. And, as mentioned in the opening paragraph, they seem specifically English. Obviously, with regard to publication of the books, this is not the case: translations and the move 'across the pond' are reaping enormous awards. Regardless of this success, how do the films cross cultural barriers and appeal to children across the globe? Within reason, they don't.If there is a third-world audience of children (the US 'M' classification and individual governance's may, in effect, ban them from seeing the film) they will, perhaps, understand only the references to magic.(In New Guinea, in 1974, 'Easy Rider' was screened, for us, as Australian soldiers, on a bedsheet outside a tent. The interested indigenous people [viewing it from the obverse] were mesmerised - but only by the music and cinematography. None of them understood English and therefore the text. Oh, dear. They probably think, to this day, that slurred and misunderstood dialogue is 'the way to go'.) The appeal of the books AND the films can only be understood within the contexts of either an elite (yes, I know, diacritics) class who can attend boarding-schools, or those granted scholarships to attend same. Surely, this is the reason for the delineated antagonism between Draco, Potter et al. The notion that old money will buy a place in the 'academy' (Draco), is offset by Potter (granted a scholarship), Hermione (innate esoteric intelligence), and Ron (perhaps second-banana to Harry) who also is there because his impoverished family has a 'free ticket-to-ride'. The only way that the reader/audience GAINS insights into these protagonists' characters is how they react to, and combine with, Harry.In some ways, the books/films are a 'rite-de-passage'. As the central characters gain knowledge, they also (perhaps) become world-weary. At the same time, however, their inter reaction with an unusual and magical world never ceases to delight. Like us, really.When is the bus due? There's something stirring in the bushes... Something wicked this way comes and it ain't a bad dream...",9,1,2,5 December 2004
Aliens," A Better Sequel
","Alien was amazing. The ambiance was incredible. The sets, the atmosphere (pun intended) created a perceived situation wherein Ripley became a disposable asset - and, of course, a means to an end. The notion that any person/worker/drone/android? can be used and abused by a multinational corporation is, of course, central to the Alien sequence. So. 'Aliens'. The humanity which was lacking in the first film comes to prominence in the second. Ripley has developed into a character clearly in need of a personal relationship - one outside her cat and/or the destructive and impersonal contingency imposed by the Corporation and its cynical and destructive use of all its employees and androids. She finds it, of course, in her fierce protection of an orphaned child. In the denouement, Supermom attacks the Bitch Queen, the rapacious hive/brood mother for whom all other living creatures are repositories for her young and ultimately (possibly) food. But, at the same time, Ripley becomes a trope for humanity's OWN unstoppable maternal/protective instinct and thus survival. The roles of Ripley and the Alien Queen become 'two sides of the same coin': different and yet part of the same whole; the same drive toward survival of species. Isn't it wonderful to write in hindsight? Ripley's own humanity becomes questionable in later episodes, particularly in number four (I'm not over-happy with 3, but 4, as lame as it is sometimes, has some wonderful sub-plots and conceits). However, that is for another review! Suffice to say that 'Aliens' is one of those rare creatures: a sequel which improves on the original and adds to it, at the least, on a plot and audience-satisfaction level. A deserved rating of CLASSIC!",9,0,1,8 December 2004
The Incredibles," Headline: PIXAR SAVES Disney AGAIN!
","You've read everyone else's comments, so these will be brief.This production is as close to faultless as they get. But, if one wishes to go over the top with praise, it is for the 2-DVD set. Not only do we get the obligatory 'how it was made' blah, blah, blah; but all those extras that everyone else has been crowing about.However, back to the film. Backgrounds: 10/10. Choice of vocal talents: 10/10. Storyline: 10/10. The reason it gets, from me, a 9/10 is due to the (apparently) problematic conversion to CGI that Pixar has in relation to their characters' faces. There are still too many similarities to 'human' faces as portrayed in 'Toy Story'. Indeed, at one point in the movie, I was drawing facial comparisons with those in same. Still, it's a minor quibble.'The Incredibles' is, without a doubt, incredible. Long may Pixar reign.",9,0,1,14 April 2005
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Tarantino is an auteur!
","Kill Bill Vol 1 is, like all Tarantino's flicks (deliberate use of the word flix), self-consciously postmodern and referential/reverential. He knows his trade and those who miss the inherent humour in this film miss the point entirely. It seems, on the surface, an uneasy marriage (!) between classical Greek tragedy and Japanese Kabuki - perhaps even Noh - theatre. And there's the rub. The violence is stylised (as usual with this director's genre) to the extent that it becomes a bloody ballet. When Uma Thurman drags her character's body into the 'Pussy Wagon' her feet become the centre of attention - a dancer's fixation - and, at this point, I have to say they are UGLY feet! Regardless, they are a dancer's feet; at once well-travelled and well-used/abused. This particular scene also indicates the strength of character which will carry the protagonist through the rest of the dance, and dance it is. Revenge places Thurman's character squarely into the role of Nemesis. This nameless virago is, however, compassionate toward the innocent - telling the child of someone she has just killed that eventually she will understand and if necessary come after the killer - is, in a twisted sense, a very moral stance. In a reference to 'revenger tragedies' only the bad are slaughtered. In the extended fight sequence they are even masked: a reference to non-entities (extras) in prior extravaganzas? THEY DON'T MATTER and here, I feel is a major point being made by Tarantino: faceless minions deserve an anonymous death. Those who kill to order deserve to die without acknowledgment. However, this film, like other Tarantino tributes to the aforementioned Greek and Japanese theatres should be enjoyed. After all, the jetting blood is very 'Monty Python and the Holy Grail'-ish. But even Tarantino draws the line at a hopping torso threatening violence. Hmmm...",Null,4,9,19 May 2004
Blade Runner," As different as peas in a pod?
","I saw the cinema release as soon as it came out, and was fascinated by what I perceived as a strange interpretation of Dick's 'Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep'. It seemed an uncomfortable juxtaposition of film noir with science fiction but was/is one of the most visually striking SF films of all time.The problem with the film, as I saw it, was the dreary and derivative commentary/voice over by the central character. Then I purchased the director's cut on video. Superb!Some years later, as an Anthropology student, there was a chance to discuss and dissect Ridley Scott's masterpiece. And there's the rub. If one looks at the theme objectively, one cannot fail to realise that ALL the women represented (bar the love interest) die extremely gory and violent deaths. This can, of course, be related to film noir in its extreme form but, one suspects that there is an underlying misogyny at work. Dare one suggest a psychosexual and possibly homoerotic reading?My comment, 'peas in a pod', refers to the notion that, as different as each cut is, the message remains the same - regardless of the interpretation granted by the viewer.Comments please.live long and prosper,",Null,0,1,20 January 2004
Fantastic Four," Disappointing, yet... it has SOMETHING.
","Way back in the 'golden years' of SF&Fantasy comics.... Well, at least I have your attention! Start again. Whom we referred to as 'trufans' (at least in the 'bad-old-days') are still, several generations later, almost the same people, albeit with new faces. Their passion is the same as ever and, one must admit, deservedly so. If anything has changed, it is the medium of film. CGI has changed everything - but sometimes not for/to the good.I would argue that FF is an acceptable translation from comic to screen. Unfortunately, we must compare it with others: most notably Sin City. There cannot be a favourable comparison. However, this review is about FF.Ioan Gruffudd, Michael Chiklis and Chris Evans form an inspired triad. However (yet again), Gruffudd, as Reed Richards, doesn't get 'grey' enough from the cosmic experience; Chiklis, as 'The Thing', is far more interesting as his underplayed Ben Grimm. Johnny Storm, as played by Evans, is exactly as he is in the Marvel comic: a complete, teenage pain-in-the-butt. They work off each other in an ensemble which has coherence and a dynamic.For me, Jessica Alba is a complete disaster as Sue Storm. She looks good (since when has being eye-candy been a job description for an actor? D'oh!) but hasn't the presence which the role requires.Still, the special effects are good, even if Julian McMahon (as Doom) can't quite cope with the change from human to (supposedly) insane demi-god. He's not quite 'insane' enough, and certainly not convincing.I give FF a score of six both for the special effects and because there is a sincerity behind its attempt to convert a Marvel favourite to the big screen.",6,6,12,7 December 2005
Sin City," This is as close as it gets to reproducing a graphic novel
","There have been/will be attempts to transfer graphic novels/comic strips to screen. By the time of X-Men 3's release, it should have been obvious that 'one doesn't annoy the fans or, indeed, treat them as idiots'. We are, after all, where the money comes from.Sin City is as close to representing the graphic novels upon which it is based as it can get.OK. Film Noir: directors, camera-persons, actors, scripts. By definition dark, moody and broody. Regardless, along comes Sin City.Violent; feminist; misogynist; brutal; improbable; hopelessly romantic; heroic; disturbing; and, ultimately, an homage to what has come before. It is, as close to perfect, as it can be.What is immediately apparent, are the multiple narrators, most of whom die. Or do they? The constant shift between points-of-view is SO cool! As is the feeling that 'something wicked this way comes'.Black and white? No way... those blacks and whites are infused with ink. Just as on the paper used by the author. Frank knows who he is. And so do we.Kudos. Forget the Marvel characters. THIS is where love hurts.",9,0,3,23 October 2006
Shark Tale," An ocean full of dying fish
","I wasn't going to add to the tales of disappointment regarding this film, but: the producers deserve yet another diatribe.Perhaps we've been spoilt with choice. Previous CGA (no, I didn't mean CGI: it's an A for animation) epics and short films have had, in the main, original stories and plot lines. 'Shark Tale' has no originality at all. Is it ironic? No. It's derivative and badly so. Is it contemporary? No. We saw the same films masquerading as entertainment last century. (I've always wanted to say that!) Any 'hip' romantic/musical comedy such as 'Carwash' et alia would always have been uncomfortable with or refused bonding to 'Goodfellas' or (because of casting and plot line) such TV staples as 'The Sopranos'.OK. The chosen voice talent is excellent. What happened to expression and nuances in delivery? It would perhaps have been better (and ironic) if each actor had reprised a recognised screenrole. The only one seeming to do this is Will Smith. Yet Oscar/Will is exactly what we expect: smartmouthed express delivery of clich√©d dialogue.Look: the animation is excellent, the backgrounds to die for. Apart from the excessive product placement, they are exceptional. But it all seems so tired, so been there before.Loved the visuals, hated the film. A begrudging 3/10.",3,2,7,21 March 2005
