Lucky Number Slevin," I had forgotten how awesome this is.
","I saw this when it first came out, and like many things, it was relegated to the past. I just had the occasion to rewatch it and I was enthralled from start to finish, almost like it was my first time seeing it. This movie is smartly written and paced. The twists are good and unless you are paying close attention, will fool you. This is Hartnett's best performance. In reality though, how can any movie starring the likes of Freeman, Kingsley, and Willis be bad? If you have never seen this movie, I urge you to watch it.",8,1,1,13 June 2019
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Get over yourselves people
","Episode 1 is meant to introduce us to the boy who would grow up to be Vader and deepen our knowledge of the Jedi religion. It does both of these exceedingly well. Here we meet the boy Anakin Skywalker, enslaved on Tatoine and eventually get our first look at the Jedi council. My only regret with this film is that Darth Maul was so short lived. John Williams outdoes himself scoring this film and the use of CGI is far and above anything I had seen up to this point.
So why did I entitle this 'get over yourselves people'? The answer is simple, Jar Jar. It seems that many people, who like me, grew up with these movies being released as they were made, simply forgot that Star Wars is meant to appeal to all ages. I mean, Ewoks, enough said? No? Do you not remember the Ewoks and their subsequent television movies? Is Jar Jar annoying, of course. It does not detract from this film though. IF YOU WATCH THESE FILMS THROUGH THE EYES WITH WHICH YOU FIRST WATCHED A STAR WARS FILM, YOU WILL LOVE IT. End of story.",8,5,7,3 January 2020
50 First Dates," Adam and Drew's best offering
","This is the story of Henry Roth and Lucy Whitmore. Henry is a Vet working at Sea World in Hawaii. He is also a playboy and uses subterfuge to hook up with as many tourists as possible. It's not that he is afraid of commitment but rather he is planning an expedition on a boat he is refurbishing to study walruses in the wild. He plans to be gone for several years. One day Henry ends up at a local diner and meets Lucy. They connect immediately and it seems like a case of love at first sight. The next day when Henry returns for their second date, Lucy acts like she does not know him. It turns out Lucy was in an accident and cannot convert short-term memories into long-term, so when she goes to sleep she forgets what transpired the day before. So Henry sets about a daily task to make Lucy fall for him anew every day.
This is pretty much my favorite rom-com ever. Sandler and Barrymore have such great chemistry together. This movie has plenty of funny parts as well as touching moments that balance each other out nicely. Great and under appreciated film here.",9,3,3,19 February 2020
Raiders of the Lost Ark," When Harrison Ford was crapping gold
","This is the first movie in the Indiana Jones series. It is also the best film in the series. Indy is hired by the US government to track down the sacred arc of the covenant. While he is on his quest the Nazis are also searching for the arc. This is a wonderful adventure story that covers many countries. Harrison Ford was born to play this role, and he does it with flair. After having seen this film quite a few times, you also get to pick out the Easter eggs that are scattered around. One hint is be on the lookout for two well known Star Wars droids.
I do not think that there was a better combination in the 80's than Lucas and Spielberg. This in everything you would want from an adventure movie and more.",9,2,2,15 November 2019
Hereditary," Complete waste of time
","I have long been a fan of horror movies. I even watch the B films, hell I even watch the movies that could be called c films. This movie was hyped right up. While it was written intelligently, it lacked any bang. It relied on a couple of jump scares that you knew were coming. I want both my money and time back. Do not bother with this turkey.",1,4,6,14 January 2019
Mulan," Could be Disney's best offering, ever
","We are introduced to the title character almost immediately in this movie. She is Mulan, an awkward Chinese girl that is trying to learn what tradition dictates a Chinese woman learn. It becomes quite clear that Mulan will never be a traditional lady, even with the help of a lucky cricket given to her by her grandmother. The family has no time to recover from Mulan's failure as the Huns are invading and the Emperor decrees that each village must offer up a man from each family to fight. Being the only man in their family, Mulan's father accepts the calling, despite being a cripple. Fearing that her father will not survive, Mulan steals off in the dead of night and enlists in her father's stead. Unbeknownst to Mulan, her ancestors send a guardian to protect her. What she ends up getting is Mushu, a disgraced dragon and Crickey, the 'lucky' cricket. Together they must work to save her lie, for discovery means death. Can Mulan help save China and defeat the Huns?Though the setting of this movie is not one with which Americans can relate, the message surely is, that women can become anything they want. What I love about this movie is this fact is not crammed down your throat as it oft is with movies that have come out since. In fact, unlike many of the feminists in newer movies, you find yourself rooting for Mulan from the very beginning. This movie does a lot for female empowerment without emasculating men in the process. Having Eddie Murphy voice Mushu was the icing on the cake. I am a straight, white man, and I absolutely love this movie and watch it probably more often than I should.",9,3,3,16 March 2020
Se7en," Morgan Freeman at his best
","This is probably my favorite crime movie of all time. It is expertly written, acted and directed. Mr. Freeman is a credit to the industry and does a superior job in bringing this character to life. I was also happily surprised by the fact that the bad guy, or rather the actor that portrayed him, was left out of the opening credits, lending to the suspense over who did it. There is a lot to unpack in this movie, so it takes a few viewings to catch it all.",9,3,4,1 November 2019
Unbreakable," Masterpiece
","This is the first movie, in what ended up as a great trilogy. I am unsure if that was M Night's idea from the start, but it works. This is the story of David Dunn, not the alliterative name, that is the sole survivor of a train crash. He is contacted by the owner of an art gallery that sells works based on comic book art. Elijah Price, who says the kids called him Mr. Glass is excellently played by Sam Jackson, as is David Dunn by Bruce Willies. These two actors give their respective characters such appeal and authenticity. I digress, Elijah works on convincing David that since he survived the train crash unscathed, that perhaps he is a real life super hero. David begins to believe this and explores what this means.
This is an extremely slow paced movie, but that is ok, this story could not be told any other way. Do not watch this thinking it is going to be like Thor, or Iron Man. This is not for everyone, but rather for those of us that grew up reading comics, but also enjoyed such things as Dante's divine trilogy. This is by far, as of this movie's release date, the best of M Night's work.",10,2,2,6 November 2019
Fight Club," 10 stars in spite of Pitt
","I hate Brad Pitt. Not because he is good looking and I am jealous. I cannot articulate why exactly I hate him so, but this extreme dislike came about the first time I saw him in Thelma and Louise. That being said, this movie is epic and good. I have long been the person to see the 'surprise' ending long before the reveal. I pick up on the small hints left by the director, follow the bread crumbs and yawn in the face of the shock everyone else wears on their faces. This movie got me. I never saw it coming. This is very well acted by Norton and even (I cannot believe I am saying this) Pitt.",10,3,4,1 November 2019
Train to Busan," South Korea tries on zombies
","During the beginning of the zombie outbreak, a father tries to get his daughter out of the town that is the epicenter, via train.Most of this movie takes place on the train, or a train I guess without giving away too much. The acting is decent, the special effects are meh. To be fair on that part, these were all newly infected people, so there was no decay to show.What I found interesting about this, as it comes from a culture where honor and class are so essential to the daily lives of the Koreans, that it lent another layer of story to the movie. One man, a powerful business man held sway over the passengers, much to their detriment.All in all a decent zombie movie, though no where near as good as some on here seem to think it is.",8,3,4,17 March 2020
Memento," Very thoughtful movie
","This is the story of Leonard, a man trying to track down his wife's killer. The catch is Leonard suffers from a disorder where he cannot retain any new memories. I forget exactly how long this takes, but within minutes, if he has not written down something to remind him of what has just happened, it is lost to him forever. He has taken to tattooing clues on his body, so not to ever lose them. This movie is told from a different perspective that i do not believe has been repeated, in reverse. It is a great story and one that you need to pay attention to. It will linger on you mind long after having watched it. The ending is probably the best part. That and the fact that if you cannot remember what happened an hour ago, how can you know who to trust, including yourself...",9,1,3,15 November 2019
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," Great addition
","This is the movie that fills in some gaps between episode 3 and episode 4. It takes place pretty much immediately before A New Hope. It shows how the rebels actually got their hands on the Death Star plans. This is a great self contained story, as it introduces many new characters. This is also a bad self contained story, as none of the newly introduced characters appear in any of the other films, so you kind of know who will be killed off. It is for this reason that I gave it seven stars. Had the movies been released in order, this would have been a solid 9.",7,1,2,20 December 2019
Captain Marvel," Good origin story
","I wanted to see this, simply because of the franchise tie in. I went in with medium expectations. I know we are in a time where genders and races all want to be equally represented in media. This is why I was not surprised when Captain Marvel turned into a woman, instead of the man I knew from the comics.
Anyway, all of that being said, this was quite honestly a great movie. There was plenty of humor and a good amount of action. This is a great origin story that ties nicely into the Marvel universe.",8,8,18,23 March 2019
Dawn of the Dead," Best remake ever
","I cannot say enough good about this movie. They took a classic and not only remade it, but improved it. A group of people during the start of the zombie outbreak find shelter at a mall. The effects here are amazing and Romero would be proud. If you like zombies, do yourself a favor and watch this.",9,3,7,23 April 2019
Iron Man 2," Decent sequel
","Iron Man 2 takes a deep, dark look at the man behind Iron Man, specifically at his inner demons. We all have them, our specific regrets that make us who we are. Tony thinking his father was never fond of him nor wanted him around. The fact that alcohol becomes a crutch to lean on as he battles the fact that he might be dying, his undying love for a Ms. Pepper Potts. During a car race two new villains appear, one is obvious, Whiplash, one not so much, Justin Hammer. Unbeknownst to Tony some new friends also appear, one Black Widow and the ever present S.H.I.E.L.D. There is a lot going on in this movie, and it probably should have been longer or made into two films. Mickey Rourke was right in that his character was not fully developed, nor was just how ever pervasive Nick Fury and S.H.I.E.L.D. are. This is still a great movie. R.D.J. was born to play Tony Stark and that fact shines through. Also, this movie has the best line in all of the MCU, and was probably echoing the thoughts of every man watching the movie; when Tony first meets Natasha (calling herself Natalie here), as she is walking away says, 'I want one'. Yeah Tony we all do.",8,1,1,24 January 2020
Forgetting Sarah Marshall," Russell Brand steals this movie
","This is a guys take on the romance genre. Peter gets dumped by Sarah, his long time girlfriend. She is an actress on a knock-off CSI show. He is the composer for the same show. Seems she had been having an affair with a rock god named Aldous Snow. Peter enters a deep state of depression. On a whim, and heavily suggested by his brother, Peter flies to Hawaii for a vacation. There he meets Rachel, a beautiful young lady, played by the unequaled Mila Kunis. Side not, he also runs into Sarah and Aldous as they happen to be on vacation at the same hotel. I know! Peter starts to develop feelings for Rachel and Sarah does not make this easy. There is a whole lot of hilarity thrown in. Jonah Hill does an excellent job as well in the small role afforded him here. This is a movie that I watch at least once a year, or when I am feeling really down, because it is that funny and good.",9,2,2,13 November 2019
The 13th Warrior," Actually better than the book
","This movie is based on the Chrichton book Eaters of the Dead. He wrote this book on kind of a bet to see if the legend of Beowulf could have arisen from actual events. While the book is good, this movie is the rare instance where it surpasses the source material.
This is the story of a traveling Arab, who comes to be known as Ibn and played by Antonio Banderas. He encounters a group of Vikings and is invited to join them for the evening. The next morning an envoy shows up with a tale of a villages under attack by a group that is invading villages and killing all. The envoy was sent to find help and the medicine woman is consulted. She sees in her bones that the tribe should send twelve warriors, plus one that is an outsider. The 13th warrior status is claimed by Ibn, albeit unwillingly.
After reaching the area that is under attack, the Vikings encounter the fire worm and discover that it is comprised of viscous men that slaughter villages for food, as in they eat their victims. The thirteen decide to seek out this group and kill them in their lair.
This is a very good movie. One could easily see this expanding into the legend that is Beowulf. As I stated previously, it far supersedes the source material and takes you on on heck of a ride.",9,7,8,20 November 2019
Shaun of the Dead," To quote the British, Brilliant
","Here is another movie that I discovered purely by accident, and could not be happier that I did. One lonely night, looking through the shelves at Blockbuster, I happened upon this and rented it.
This is the story of a lovable loser named Shaun, his ever present friend Ed and his girlfriend Liz. As Shaun tries to be the man Liz needs, while staying the man-child friend Ed needs, he keeps screwing up his relationship with Liz. This leads to her dumping him. The next day, resolved to win her back, also happens to be the beginning of the Zombie apocalypse. The hilarity ensues as Shaun tries to get his mom, Ed and Liz to safety.
What works about this movie is everything. Simon Peg is a huge horror nerd, so there are many outright, the movie title for one, and even more tongue in cheek nods to what came before in the genre. There is also a great social commentary that runs through the movie, where you can see they are trying to show that the human race has become little more than zombies already. This is a perfect fil for anyone that has a sense of humor and likes zombies/horror movies.",10,4,5,11 November 2019
The Notebook," Can IMDB owe me stars?
","I only give this one star, because it is not possible for me to give zero or negative stars. To say I do not like this movie is being kind. I abhor this movie. Usually I can find at least one redeeming quality about a movie, but this was not the case here. It is not because it is a romance movie, I love A Walk To Remember. The premise is good, the whole thing is just poorly executed. I will never suffer through this movie again, and all of you that rate this ten stars, please, I mean that seriously, please explain to my why.",1,3,7,13 November 2019
The Girl Next Door," Very good movie with an even better soundtrack
","This is the story of a high school senior that fall in love with the girl next door. The twist here is that she ends up being a porn star (former) and the shenanigans that ensue when her former boss tries to force her to return to the industry. What is most heartening about this movie, is the way the characters interact, but mostly how Danielle coaxes Matthew out of his shy shell. Emile Hirsch is too new to the craft to have been handed the leading role here. His acting leaves a lot to be desired, but Elisha Cuthbert is a living goddess and shines in this role.
As for the soundtrack, my god did they do a great job picking out the music for this movie. From Teenage Wasteland to This Years Love to Lucky Man, I find myself singing along as much as I do enjoying the story.",9,2,2,11 November 2019
Knives Out," Good but not great
","Here we have a murder mystery done in the style of Agatha Christie. It is smartly written and was one of very very very few movies like this where I was kept guessing throughout. An accomplished author named Harlan Thrombey dies and the police rule it a suicide. Before they can close the case though a renowned private detective named Benoit Blanc shows up claiming he has been hired to find a murderer. The whole family is suspect and the home nurse that took care of Harla, Marta, is pulled in to help try and sort out who that might be.
This movie has such an amazing cast of some very accomplished and respected actors, there was no way in hell it would fail. I loved the many twists it took to reach the final unveiling of who killed Harlan. This movie should have been a 10, but I knocked off three stars for two reasons. The first and foremost is while Daniel Craig is a great actor, having him adopt an American accent was a poor choice. He neither does it well nor convincingly. Second there were some points where it felt like it dragged on just a bit. I think the editing team could have trimmed some fat. Other than that I could find no flaws in this film.",7,3,6,20 January 2020
The Fifth Element," That's no moon, that's the ultimate evil
","Every five thousand years, the ultimate evil comes to Earth to destroy all life. There is no reason for this, nor for the amount of time that passes between visits. The only thing capable of stopping the ultimate evil is the supreme being, or fifth element. This, along with four stones that activate the fifth element into being the ultimate weapon are protected by a friendly alien race. The time has come and it is up to former military specialist Korben Dallas to help get Leeloo, the fifthe element, to a resort to regain the stones, and then back to Earth to defeat the ultimate evil. Of course there is the greedy human known as Zorg, that aligns himself with the ultimate evil in hopes of monetary gain.
This is a great movie, filled with visual scenes that are new and exciting as well as well written characters. Plenty of action to be had here as well.",8,3,4,20 November 2019
Finding Nemo," Pixar has yet to top this movie.
","Long have I loved this movie. This is the story of a lovable, yet over protective clown fish and his son, Marlon and Nemo respectively. On the first day of school, Nemo is taken off the reef by a dentist from Sydney. Marlon sets out to rescue his son. On the way he quite literally runs into a Blue Dart named Dory. Dory has a disorder where she can not retain short term memories. The two set out together and hilarity ensues. This is a Disney owned movie so of course there are some touching moments as well as a happy ending, but the substance of the movie is phenomenal. The detail the animators put into it is fantastic. They also manage to squeeze in some Easter eggs, and not all of them are Pixar/Disney related. The great white shark is named Bruce, which was the nickname given to the animatronic shark in Jaws. To me there is no better film in the realm of animation out there, before or after.",10,3,3,13 December 2019
The Day After Tomorrow," Come on people.
","How many times do I need to read other's reviews on disaster films before I remember most people on here writing these think they are actual film critics? It is a disaster movie. Yes, the science is terrible. Yes the coincidences are fantastical. If you watch these for ground breaking stories with rich plots, or for an Oscar worthy performance by one of the actors, then you are watching these for the wrong damn reasons.
This movie shows a future where due to the rise in global temperatures, a modern ice age is triggered. How it is ushered in is by these violent, giant hurricane-like storms that cause flash freezing, and bring in a myriad of disasters with them. These include tsunamis and blizzards that drop so many feet of snow that people are walking level with the signs on the interstate that you would normally drive under. It also tries to throw in a lot of relatable human elements, such as the struggle of a man that is an absentee parent because of his job, trying to connect with his son, a lonely boy dying of cancer, and just the human death that this kind of disaster would bring.
Do not watch this for the science, though I do feel that they had the causation of another ice age correct. Do not watch this for deep plot. Watch this for the enjoyable ride on which it takes you.",8,29,32,18 November 2019
Crash," Wonderful poignant
","This movie centers around several separate stories, and how they intertwine with each other. it explores so many of the prejudices that we as a people have for other humans, and how deeply these prejudices can impact others. This film features a star studded cast and is wonderfully told. This is a must watch before you die movie.",10,4,5,4 November 2019
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," Epic conclusion of the first trilogy
","When I saw this, it was the third film is the Star Wars franchise. Now it is the sixth, but it is not sixth in order of greatness. This film covers Luke's becoming a Jedi, and the rebels taking the fight back to the empire. Reviewing this film so many years after it came out, the only flaw I can see is the blandness of the lightsaber duels in comparison to the modern movies. That is all I can say bad about it though. People have enjoyed talking crap about the Ewoks, but those same people forget that these movies are geared towards families, and you need the cute to counter the ugly. The best part of this movie, the green saber. Up until this film came out, all we had was red or blue. The green was epic.",9,3,4,20 December 2019
Alien," The one that started it all.
","This is a masterpiece. From the long, detailed shots of both interior and exterior of the ship, to the fleeting glimpses of the alien, this is cinematography at it's best. The movie is paced slow, in order to build tension, and it was the right decision. Alien paved the way for a whole new genre of movie, scifi horror. Ridley Scott birthed an instant classic, and unfortunately has not been able to repeat such a marvel.",10,5,6,16 March 2019
Suicide Squad," The second best DC film this decade
","This film, while not as good as Wonder Woman, is still a very good effort by DC. I don't know why or how, but DC keeps missing the mark with their movies. Suicide Squad was a welcome anomaly.
This movie focuses on a group of DC villains that are recruited for what looks like a suicide mission, hence the title. The military has held a witch captive, but lose their control over her, and she means to lay waste to the world. It is up to this group of people, facing a lifetime in prison, to take her out before her plans come to fruition.
There are quite a few of the bad guys from the world of DC that are featured in this movie, and featured well. Margot Robbie and Will Smith embody their characters of Harley Quinn and Deadshot respectively. Jared Leto's turn as the Joker, while heavily teased in the trailers, amounted to very little screen time, and that was probably for the best as he did not do a very good job at it. The biggest detraction for this movie to me was Cara Delevingne as the enchantress. I do not feel that she is a very talented actress and perhaps another could have done a better job. Still, as far as movies based on DC comics go, this one was very good.",8,3,4,14 November 2019
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," A solid, sobering farewell
","Forty-two years. That is the span of time between the beginning and the end. Like all good things, everything must.
I went into this with medium expectations. I left floored. Disney has outdone themselves on this film, and I dare say it is second only to Empire.
For those that are not familiar with the plot; The emperor has risen from the ashes and has an eye on concurring the galaxy yet again. To do this, he must defeat Rey, and he needs Kylo Ren to meet this end.
As is the way of all things Star Wars, this is an epic tale of good versus evil. There are many laughs and also many tears to be had in this film. Many characters that you love will meet their end, and some heroes will rise from defeat. I do not like doing spoilers, so I will leave it at that.
I will wind this up with the following; Episode 4, which was just called Star Wars back then, was the first movie I remember seeing. I was four and it had that strong of an impact on me. I have enjoyed all three of the trilogies, some more than others. Leaving the theater last night, I was left an emotional wreck, but I was satisfied with the ending. The scenes with Carrie Fisher were of course the saddest to me, yet if I did not know she had passed, I wouldn't have thought them so sobering. In conclusion, this was a great movie, I actually wish that it was longer.",9,3,15,20 December 2019
Forrest Gump," I liked it, but I did not love it
","I get why so many people gush over this movie, I really do. I have watched it quite a few times myself. It is good to kill a few hours and be entertained. It ain't great though. The overwhelming emotion I feel for Forrest is pity, as he is strung along and used by the object of his affections. This is a decent movie, perhaps one of the best from Mr. Hanks, but I do not feel it deserves as much hype as it gets.",6,6,10,1 November 2019
Justice League," Mixed feelings
","The first time I saw this, I really was not that fond of it. I really wanted to like it. Batman is my second favorite superhero from childhood. I also loved the Wonder Woman movie. I guess there were too many parallels between this movie and the Avengers. Insect like aliens, magical squares, or boxes.
I gave it a second chance the other day with my son. I found a new appreciation for this film that day. The honor if good, though still not on par with Marvel. The action is decent, though there were some parts of the CGI that were very clearly CGI. Overall a decent adaptation of the source material.",6,2,12,30 March 2019
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Really? 18 years old already?
","I cannot believe that this film is 18 years old as I sit to write this. Having read the book and sat through the horrendous animated version of this from the 70's, or was it the 80's?, I was beside myself with excitement. Peter Jackson was tasked with bringing this sweeping epic to life on the big screen, and boy did he deliver. He basically divided up the book into three parts for the sake of transferring them to live action and include as much as possible. That was a wise choice, though in truth he could have done five or six movies and still not got everything in.
This first movie deals with the discovery that Bilbo Baggins had been in possession of the ring of power since his adventures as told in the Hobbit. There are dark forces seeking the one ring, and Gandalf tasks Bilbo's nephew Frodo with bringing the ring to the elves. Once there, there is a meeting of all the beings that make up middle Earth and it is decided that a fellowship shall be formed to see the ring safely to Mount Doom, where it was formed and the only place where it can be destroyed.
This film is gorgeous, It makes me want to visit New Zealand where it was filmed. At around three hours, it is still not enough and I was aghast at where it left you. That place is known as hanging. Even familiar with the story, I could not wait to see the sequel. This is definitely, along with the other two in the series, a must see before you die movie.",8,1,1,15 November 2019
The Thing," Practical effects are the best
","What can I say about this movie that has not been said by so many before me? This is what was once known as a cult classic, but I feel it is coming into its own as a real classic. John Carpenter does a phenomenal job weaving suspense with terror, touching on the distrust of others that we all harbor. Without giving away too much, even the ending leaves you wondering. The acting in this is great, with so many seasoned and up and coming actors inter mixed. This is one of those films that is so much better than the movie upon which it is based. I absolutely love the use of practical effects as well. If this movie was made today, with all digital effects, I feel if would lose something.",8,2,4,1 November 2019
Armageddon," Great disaster film
","When an armature sky watcher notices a giant rock in space, he contacts NASA. It is discovered that the asteroid is on a direct collision course with Earth, and is large enough to snuff out life as we know it. A plan is hatched to send up a team of deep Earth drillers to lay in a nuclear device and split the asteroid before it gets too close, deflecting the two halves enough to miss us.Once again, for the slow people in the back, it is a disaster film. The science is going to be terrible. If you have not yet figures out that fact from this and any other disaster films, you never will. I feel that the people that watch these and then judge them based upon how bad the science is are the same people that go to a Star Trek movie with a book that gives a breakdown of the Enterprise and get upset when the movie ship and book ship differ. These are meant as fantasy and escapism devices, not science lessons.This is a good film, with a great cast and many amazing one liners. As I say with all my disaster movie reviews, put it on, shut off your brain and enjoy. This one is definitely one hell of a ride.",8,1,1,5 May 2020
The Village," Criminally Underrated Film
","This is the story of a small village, isolated in the woods before the advent of indoor plumbing or electricity. The story is somewhat centralized on the Walker family. The eldest daughter is played magnificently by Bryce Dallas Howard. She is blind and has an undying love for Lucius Hunt, played by the unequaled Jaoquin Phoenix, who refuses to acknowledge the mutual attraction. He had just denied the advances of the other Walker daughter, Kitty. Lucius is not the only gentleman that would have her though as there is a mentally deficient fellow named Noah Percy played by Adrien Brody with his usual excellence, who has desires for Ivy (BDH). The village seems to be idyllic in every aspect, but soon we find out that the color red in bad, as it attract and angers a race of creatures that dwell in the woods surrounding the village, called 'those we do not speak of'. The village elders had come to a peace accord with the creatures, but soon they start to find slaughtered animals within the village boundaries, making some fear that those we do not speak of (twdnso) have broken the accord. Life goes on, as it does and Lucius and Ivy announce they plan on wedding. In a rage Noah stabs Lucius. Against the will of the elder council, Edward Walker dispatches his blind daughter on a trip through the creature filled woods to another village nearby to get medicines to save Lucius. Will she succeed or will twdnso kill her before she can save her love?
This movie has one of the best casts ever assembled and this is in turn a great movie. I do not know where all the hate comes from. It is slightly more predictable than other works by M. Night, but it is still a great and solid entry by the man.",9,4,4,3 February 2020
Split," How McAvoy did not get an Oscar....
","Here comes an unlikely sequel to Unbreakable. Of course, you do not know this is a sequel until the very end of the movie. This movie is the story of a many that suffers from associated identity disorder, better known as multiple personalities. McAvoy shows the world what acting is like, by breathing a unique personality into each and every one of them his character possesses. From the inflection of his voice, to the accent, right down to the body language, you recognize each personality with ease. The most fierce of his personalities is known as the beast, and the beast enjoys killing. Central to the story is the three young women that are captured and held hostage awaiting the beast to come and destroy them.This movie is very much a thinking man's movie, with a superhero/villain subplot. If you have seen Unbreakable then watch this, and immediately follow up with Glass.",10,3,4,4 November 2019
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," Perhaps a perfect sequel
","The long awaited follow up to The Terminator came out with a bang. We are introduced with two different terminators, one being an exact copy of the original and the other slightly smaller but seemingly more advanced. They are both seeking John Conner. Sarah has ended up committed and John is in foster care. We very quickly find out that the T-800 (Arnold) has been reprogrammed to protect John while the T-1000 was sent back to kill him. We also are introduced to the amazing technology of the T-100 where it is comprised of liquid metal and can take on the guise of anyone it 'samples' or form any kind of sharp, stabbing weapon it chooses. The race is on to see if the three heroes can escape Skynet's deadly plan.This movie is how a sequel should be done. It grabs your attention from the opeing scene and it does not relent. This is also where they should have probably stopped making these movies, because there is no way possible to follow this without letting people down. They set the bar way too high here, and that is definitely not a bad thing.",9,0,0,22 May 2020
Spider-Man," The best there was, until the MCU took over
","Clearly by the title, I am reviewing this movie well after Homecoming and Far From Home dropped. Let us, together, take a trip back in time 17 years ago, to when this gem hit the theaters. I have long been a Spider-man fan, from as far back as I can remember. He was my favorite part of the Electric Company when I was a kid. This was the best adaptation of the source material to have come out. They expertly captured the spirit that the hero embodies, including his quick whit. This movie fires on all cylinders, and the only reason it got a 9 is because I have see what the future holds for my man Peter Parker.",9,1,1,1 November 2019
Aliens," What is better than one alien? MANY
","The original film was beyond excellent. This film is neither better, nor worse than that film, it is equally as good. Instead of being stuck on a ship with one Alien ripping apart her crew, Ripley is trapped on a planet where the Aliens have made a home. The extended cut of this movie, while long, is the very best version of it. It fills in quite a few plot holes, but even the standard version is a masterpiece.",10,3,5,29 October 2019
Resident Evil," Great movie, though nothing like the game
","Deep under the ground of Raccoon City lies the hive, a secret facility run by the evil Umbrella Corporation. A secret bio-weapon known as the T-Virus is set free, turning everyone that dies into a zombie. This is a fantastic take on the game, though it barely resembles it. Instead of the title characters, we get Alice, who is far more bad-ass that Leon or Claire or Chris ever thought of being.
I really loved this movie and the series that followed it, though some were stronger entries than others. This is a fast paced, creepy and at times funny movie that is a must see for any fan of the zombie genre.",9,2,2,13 January 2020
Avengers: Endgame," I honestly wanted to like this more
","There will be a lot of people gushing on here about this movie. Make no mistake, it was good, just not great. 21 films leading up to this point have built the tension, and what should have been a sonic boom was closer to a car backfiring. At three hours, this is a long movie. While there are moments of great humor and great sadness and great happiness, it also dragged in spots. One would expect it to be 95% action, but they spent a lot of time on fluff. Again, do not misunderstand me. I liked this movie quite a bit, but I wanted to love it, and sadly I didn't.",8,3,5,27 April 2019
The Princess Bride," Feels like home
","Here we have what is perhaps the perfect family film. It is the story of pirates, giants, killer eels, wars, fencing, revenge and true love. This movie is an absolute masterpiece, with characters and story telling that are both nearly infallible. Every time I watch this, I return to my childhood and the fond memories of watching this in awe. I have shared this with all of my kids, and they too love this movie, because how can one not?",9,0,0,5 May 2020
It Follows," Good but not great
","The premise of this movie was quite unique and that is what drew me into watching it, six years after it was released.For unknown reasons and unexplained force seeks out a young man. The only way to rid himself of this force is to let it kill him, or to have sex with someone, thereby passing the curse along to them. The latter is his choice and we meet Jay, an odd (to me) young lady that goes out on a date with this guy. They end up having sex and he shows her 'it'. Jay is at first traumatized because she feel violated, he knocks her out and ties her up to prove 'it' is real. She soon realizes that 'it' is real and the chase is on. She gets help from her sister and some friends, but the question of whether she can escape is never far from your mind.This is a well done entry into the newer horror genre. It is quite creepy at times, but not outright scary, unless you have not seen a lot of horror movies. Though the main premise of this movie is sleep with someone to be free, the sex is not explicit and the nudity is quite obscured and fleeting. So yeah, not great but a very good movie.",6,1,2,22 May 2020
The Little Mermaid," The best Disney film
","I am a man that loves this movie. It came out when I was in my teens, and has been a favorite of mine ever since. This is the story of Ariel, a mermaid that wants more out of life, and has an unnatural obsession with all things associated with humans. Despite her father's wishes, she longs to be human, and falls in love with a prince. She essentially sells her soul to a witch to become human and try to win his heart.The songs in this film are sweet, funny, sad and emotional. The voice cast is outstanding. There are the negatives of course, but any negative is far outweighed by the positives. This is a fun movie from start to finish.",8,3,3,4 November 2019
2012," Disaster at its best
","This movie came out in response to the belief that the Mayan calendar predicted the world would end in 2012. This story is centralizes around a failed author and his estranged family, and the lengths he is willing to travel to protect them all when humanity seems doomed. As with all disaster movies, do not expect great science or plot. I will tell you that out of all the disaster films I have seen, this one has some of the best, edge of your seat action sequences, Woody Harrelson steals the show as Charlie, the semi-crazy conspiracy nut, radio host.",8,2,4,18 November 2019
The Incredibles," Pixar's second best movie, but only just...
","Nemo just slightly edges this out for me, but this movie is great just the same. It is filled with the kind of things that makes a life long superhero nerd smile and laugh. This is the story of a family of superheros that have adapted to civilian life. The reason for this? As the world became more litigious, people that were hurt collaterally by superheros started to sue for their injuries. This plot device is genius because it is so very believable. After years in retirement Bob Parr, AKA Mr. Incredible gets recruited for a mission by a mysterious person. Of course the person that recruits Bob has nefarious intentions, and unleashes a seemingly indestructible machine on the world. It is us the the Parrs, Mr. Incredible, Elastigirl, Violet and Dash, along with the family friend Frozone to save the day. I love that they cast Sam Jackson in the role as Frozone, because his super power is making ice, and Sam Jackson is the coolest MF out there. This is a great movie, not just from an animation stand point, but in the whole realm of superhero films as well.",9,2,2,13 December 2019
A Quiet Place," Best watched in a theater
","I saw this at the theater when it first came out. The silence is the thing that puts this movie over the top. While still enjoyable from home, ambient sounds associated with home viewing detract from the suspense.
That being said, this is an excellent movie. It keeps you on edge from start to finish. Krasinski and Blunt are amazing together. This was one of the best new horror movies to come along in a very long time. It will tear at your heart strings several times. Well written, amazingly well acted and supremely directed. The Quiet Place is well worth anyone's time.",9,1,1,14 April 2019
Ex Machina," Not what I expected
","I went into this movie expecting one thing, only to find it was completely different. There are some very good plot twists in here that make a review of the plot difficult. A young guy wins a chance to go stay with the owner of the company for which he works, to take part in a very secret product development. It turns out that his boss has developed a very lifelike robot with full AI and he tasks his employee with testing it in conversations. That is all I feel comfortable saying about the plot. This movie is excellently done, from the acting to the direction to the cinematography. It is pretty close to a masterpiece. This is not, I repeat not the kind of movie to watch if you cannot think while watching a movie. This is most definitely a thinking person's film.",9,3,4,14 November 2019
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Goodbye to an old friend
","Star Wars, or as the rest of the world came to know it, A New Hope, was the very first movie I ever remember going to see at a drive-in in New Jersey when I was a kid. Immediately it captivated me and for the last 43 years has maintained that captive hold on my imagination. Essentially a story about good versus evil, it is the way in which the story is told, along with the mystical powers of the Jedi and Sith that makes it so appealing. There are a lot of amazingly awesome characters thrown in along the way, and over the course of my life these pretend people have become like family to me. Anyone that give any of the movies in the Star Wars universe a poor review is not a true fan, in my opinion. Each and every movie is a new adventure. Granted there are some movies that are far superior to others, but they are all good and enjoyable in their own ways. Removing the creator, George Lucas from the telling of these stories was probably not the best decision, but I cannot find any reason to hate these films, nor go on here or any other form of social media and bemoan how awful they are. Each death of a main character is like a punch directly to my heart.I know none of that preamble has anything to do with this movie, and if you are still with me, then I thank you. I just needed to spout off some positivity here to counter the hate.The last Jedi follows the beginning of Rey's training under Luke, though begrudgingly so. It expands upon the abilities of force users to speak over vast distances to the point that they can now see each other, which was pretty cool to me. Rey is is led to face Snoke by Ben Solo/Kylo Ren. Ren hopes Rey will join him and she hopes he will join her. While Snoke is focused on Rey, Ren uses the distraction to kill him. The resistance is being run down by the First Order with no hope of escape as they have developed a means of tracking a ship through hyperspace. Leia launches an ill fated plan to elude them, which strands the very small remnants of the Resistance on an desolate planet. As they all hide in a bunker, awaiting help that will not come and facing their impending doom, Luke shows up, without explanation. He gives Leia the dice from the Falcon, one of this movie's most touching scenes, and goes out to face the might of the First Order alone so his sister can lead their people to safety. What follows is the most impressive display of force mastery in any of the movies. Kylo faces Luke in a duel, but soon discovers that Luke is only projecting himself on the planet and is still in his exile. The ruse works, and with the help of an escaped Rey and Chewie, the small band that is the Resistance escapes. Sadly though, the amount of energy Luke used to project himself so far across the galaxy causes his body to fail. In one of the most beautiful shots in the franchise, Luke sits atop a mountain looking at the sun, much like we saw in A New Hope, and his body vanishes as he joins the force. For the second time in as many new Star Wars movies I had to say goodbye to a friend that I walked through most of my life with. I get that this trilogy was meant to usher in a new group of people, but it was still one of the saddest moments of my Star Wars experience.This is of course not a perfect movie, and it does have flaws, like how is Rey so powerful without any training to really speak of, but it is a GREAT MOVIE.",8,2,9,20 May 2020
Evil Dead," Slightly better than the original
","I have long been a fan of The Evil Dead, especially the 1981 film that launched it all. Putting the two films side by side with an honest comparison of each, discounting budgetary differences and advances in effects technology, this one wins in my book, but just barely. While the original scared me as a tween, this one is still creepy after having seen it a few times. I greatly appreciate the camp factor in the original, but enjoy the darker feel to this film batter. I am in no way denigrating the first Evil Dead.",8,2,4,12 November 2019
The Evil Dead," Campy, gory and fun
","I saw this when I was a kid, not sure exactly how old, somewhere in the tween range. Back then special effects were not what they are today, and a movie with such a small budget had even worse special effects that better funded films of the same era. Still, the movie creeped me out back then. As a 40 something adult I enjoy it for many other reasons, not least the camp factor. This movie, the two sequels and the show that were spawned from it are all great entertainment for anyone that enjoys horror.",7,3,3,12 November 2019
Logan," It is about endings which I want to speak.
","This movie makes me so happy and so sad at the same time. It takes us on such an emotional roller coaster while following along on the final journey of the wolverine as we have all come to know him. Hugh Jackman was made to play this part and has over the last, what 20 years, played him perfectly. This film is visually gorgeous and the characters so well written. In the end though, we say goodbye to some very cherished characters and that is a very sad thing.",10,1,1,10 November 2019
The Dark Knight," Best comic to movie ever
","Typically I am a Marvel fan. Spiderman is my all time favorite super hero, and as for this trilogy, this is the only film I liked. Begins put me to sleep each and every time I tried to watch it and Rises bored me to tears. Heath Ledger is just a marvel to behold, if DC will forgive the use of that word. I have always enjoyed Batman, and I did not think anyone could out Joker Nicholson. Heath Ledger blew me away with his performance. Some say his award of an Oscar was because he died, but I do not agree. His performance here is one of the top five performances by any actor/actress in the entire history of film, in my opinion. Even if super heros are not your thing, even if you hate Batman, watch this movie.",10,2,4,30 October 2019
Midsommar," Interesting
","A group comprised of three friends and one of their girlfriends goes to Sweden to witness and take part in a pagan ritual that is celebrated once every 90 years. As the ritual progresses we see the American visitors coming under duress and having terrible things happen to them. That is the movie in a nutshell. I watched this for a couple of reasons. I love Florence Pugh. I think she is as talented an actor as she is beautiful. I had also heard some very good things about the movie. This has been marketed as a horror movie, and my friends, this it is not. I would say that there are some tense moments that would make this a thriller/drama. There is little here in the way of suspense as you can pretty much forecast the fate of the outsiders. I feel that they were going for a better, updated version of the wicker man and they did accomplish both, but with less drama. This is still a good movie with some interesting story points. I would probably not watch it again and would definitely not call it a horror movie. My apologies to Ash from Whatculture, as I know she had included this in some of her horror movie lists.",7,7,10,21 January 2020
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," Jim Carrey show a serious side
","This movie is a deep dark look at loss and regret, and the desire to forget forever the things that cause us deep emotional anguish. Jim and Kate play a couple that had a rough break up, despite the fact that they were deeply in love. Jim goes to a company that will come into your house, and while you sleep seek out and destroy painful memories. What makes this interesting, well there are many things that make this movie interesting, but what really stands out is the way that Jim's character struggles within himself to hold on to the memories he so wanted erased initially. This movie is a sobering look at the thing that makes us what we are, our choices and the pain or reward that they bring. Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet do a phenomenal job in this movie.",8,6,7,4 November 2019
Rio," Good movie, but full of issues
","I really enjoyed this film. It is the story of a Sphinx Blue Macaw that is the last known male, aptly named Blu. He and his owner are flown to Rio to see if Blu might mate with a female in an effort to 'save the species'. There are of course the obligatory bad guys that steal the pair of birds with a mind to sell them for a profit. We end up with a family friendly tale of love and devotion and how great people can be. There are a lot of vivid colors and great songs to keep the attention of kids, and enough over the head jokes to keep the adults amused.Now for the issues. This movie touches on but does not address the terrible thing that happens at the opening of the movie, how parrots are stolen from the wild and the sold as pets. Contrary to popular belief, parrots are not domesticated and should not be kept as pets. These are animals that are still wild at heart and they are also highly intelligent, so this act is akin to an advanced alien race kidnapping your children and keeping them as pets. Sure, the kids might eventually bond with their captor, but it is far from the ideal situation for them. Also they show Blu drinking hot chocolate and eating what looks like chocolate chip cookies, both poisonous to parrots. This is a gross misrepresentation of how to care for a parrot, and one day one of the people that saw this and thought how great a pet a parrot might make will kill their bird through ignorance. I do not mean to climb up on a soapbox here in the review section, but if you are going to put out a movie that so terribly represents how to care for a pet like this, then the issue needs to be addressed.In closing, this is a great family movie that anyone who does not have a parrot in their care would love and even those that do will enjoy it to a certain point.",6,1,1,21 April 2020
Groundhog Day," Perfect mix of comedy and thought
","It's that time of year again, and Phil is off to Punxsutawney to see the groundhog. There is a big storm coming, but Phil is the lone weatherman to say it will miss the area. He has a surly attitude and abhors this trip. It is made slightly more enjoyable by the producer Rita coming along. Throw in the goofy cameraman named Larry, and you have quite the dysfunctional trio. Phil ends up in a time loop, doomed to repeat groundhog day for eternity, and he is the only one aware of this. Each day the events of the previous day are erased, along with everyone's memory, except poor Phil.
Now, forget the fact that Bill Murray is far too old to be a romantic interest for Andie MacDowell, and the rest is just plain fun. It is well acted and the jokes are still funny when you've seen this the 100th time. Will poor Phil ever see tomorrow, or will he be stuck forever in groundhog day?",10,3,4,14 November 2019
Beauty and the Beast," Stunning remake
","If you are unfamiliar with the story of Beauty and the Beast, then you must have lived under a rock for a very long time. I shall not talk about the plot or story line here, but rather my immense surprise at how extremely well done was this movie. First and foremost, I do not know if Emma Watson's singing voice was touched up in post production, but she sings extremely well. I have never fully cared for her work up to this point. I never enjoyed the Harry Potter films, and really hadn't seen her in anything else since. By pure happenstance, I was flipping through channels and ended up watching part of this. I really enjoyed the 91 version, so I ordered the live action and finally sat down to watch it. Disney did such a tremendous job with this. I have never been a fan of taking a cartoon and making a live action film from it. To me they usually lose something in the translation. This is not the case here, as Disney improved the original. This is a visually gorgeous movie that is very well done.",8,1,3,11 November 2019
The Happening," I don't see the issue
","A lot of people I know, and a lot of reviewers on here run this movie down. Is it great? No. But it is a good movie. It could even be plausible. Humans are a blight upon this world, and who is to say that nature wouldn't act out against us? No the writing is not the best for MNS, but it is a good thriller. Give it a shot.",7,4,6,12 April 2019
Zombieland," Great fun
","I liked this movie far more than I expected I would. It follows four people as the navigate the zombie apocalypse. This movie has everything one might want in a horromedy; humor, gore, love interests and of course, zombies. There could not have been a better cast selected for this movie. Woody and Jesse play so well off each other.",10,4,6,11 November 2019
Die Hard," Ultimate man's Christmas movie
","This movie is perfect, and it counts as a holiday film. Bruce Willis launches his action career here with flair. The action is well paced and no matter how many times I have seen this, I enjoy it fully.",10,2,4,15 December 2018
Love Actually," Great Adult Christmas Movie
","I re-watched this last night, as is my yearly tradition. This movie has it all, laughs, tears, things to anger you, all set around Christmas. This is actually eight different love stories intricately woven together into a wonderful single film, with a six degrees of separation theme involved as well as almost every character is connected to at least one other character in the film. If you can make it through this movie without laughing aloud a few times, or shedding a few tears, then you are inhuman, much like the Grinch before his heart grew. This is star studded with some of Great Britain's finest actors and is just as good on the tenth viewing as it was the first.",9,3,5,11 December 2019
Burlesque," A tale as old as time
","This is Showgirls, only way better. Ali is a poor girl living in rural settings and decides to save money and head west to pursue her dream, to be a singer. Luck finds her in a run down bar that runs a nightly burlesque show where the performers only lip sync to songs and dance provocatively. Ali weasels her way into being a waitress there, basically forces the bartender to be her friend and crashes at his place. He is in a complicated relationship and she has her eyes on the cliche rich older hot guy. Ali catches yet further a break when the 'star' of the show quits. Fast forward, the star returns and is all jelly of Ali for stealing the spotlight. She kills the music during a routine but gasp, Ali can wail!!!!!!! I think you can see where this is going, god knows I did after the first five minutes. There is some drama thrown in about the bar almost going into foreclosure, and a love triangle. This movie is pretty predictable from start to finish and we are not even graced with any nudity from a single performer in the burlesque show. I know, I know, you are reading this thinking, 'But Tony, you gave it 9 stars!' Hell yeah I did and the answer to your why is super simple. Christina Aquilera can wail!!!! Every time she busts out into a song gives me goosebumps, and I am a straight white man. (Sorry) So if you can stomach Cher (I barely could) and want to enjoy some phenomenal songs surrounded by so-so drama, this movie is for you.",9,3,3,20 January 2020
Stranger Than Fiction," Not your typical Will Ferrell
","I went and saw this against my better judgement. I had not yet seen a movie where Will Ferrell was the lead that I actually liked. I like him well enough in supporting roles, but I do not find his comedic style to be one with which I jive. Regardless of this, I found this movie to be well above par.
This is the story of Harold Crick, who while going about his life starts to hear someone narrating what he is doing. Determined to show that he is not going crazy, Harold does his best to figure out who is narrating his life, and why. Do not think that this movie is long on laughs, it is not. This is a more serious film, with a touch of romance thrown in. Will Ferrell and Maggie Gyllenhaal are both great in their roles. This is a very well done movie with some very big name actors relegated to supporting roles.",8,2,2,6 November 2019
Jaws," What to say?
","What can be said about this movie that has not been said a thousand times already. This is the movie that started the shark attack genre of films and 44 years later is still the best of them all. It is by pure happenstance that the wonderful suspense that build through the film by not seeing the shark is actually a direct fault of problems with the mechanical beast they made, affectionately called Bruce (This being an Easter egg for the name of the great white in Finding Nemo). And suspense does build, not because you are not aware that it is the shark killing people, but because unlike many of the films that came along in this genre, it is not in you face. It is a subtle threat and you can sympathize with the people that are being hunted. The cinematography here is phenomenal, as is the acting. This is one of Richard Dreyfus's best roles. This is a long, slow story that back in the 70's was scary as hell, but to a more desensitized group of movie watchers will still be good, but without a lot of the scare factor. This is one of my must see before you die movies.",9,7,11,15 November 2019
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Wished this was darker
","This is the third and perhaps best of the prequel trilogy. The Emperor has decided to rear his head and execute all the Jedi in the universe. We see the fall of Anakin and the rise of Vader. We see the decimation of the jedi order and the birth of those that will resist the Empire. What this movie lacks in acting skills, sorry Hayden, some of this was out of your reach, it makes up for in amazing action and beautiful lightsaber duels. I just wish this had been as dark as Lucas had promised. Overall a very enjoyable film.",9,2,2,9 January 2020
The Waterboy," You can do it!
","I know, I know. Does this movie really deserve a 10 you ask. well since reviews are subjective, I feel it does. If you'd care to read on, I shall endeavor to explain why.
Bobby Boucher is a mentally challenged young man that lives with his mother in the Louisiana bayou. His sole job in life is as the water-boy for the local college football team. This is a job he takes excessively serious. One day one of the players upsets Bobby and Bobby attacks him and gets fired. He begins a search for a new place to ply his unique skills and gets a new position, though working for free. Soon though the coach sees Bobby's rage attack and gets him enrolled in the college so he can play football. Keeping it a secret from his mother who would not approve, Bobby becomes not only successful at college, but a force beyond compare on the field, carrying the team to a bowl game.This movie works so well on every aspect. Adam Sandler has a few movies under his belt so his acting is vastly improved from his earlier movies. So I give this film 10 stars because it is my favorite of all his films. It is a movie I can watch over and over and still laugh. Great movie here for football fans and comedy fans alike.",10,3,3,12 February 2020
The Iron Giant," Does a familliar story equal a bad movie?
","The short answer is I think not. This is the story of a young boy named Hogarth that grew up in the 1950's. His dad is not in the picture and we can deduce that he dies in world war two from a picture Hogarth has. Essentially friendless, Hogarth has a vivid imagination and a sens of wonder that we all lose as we age. He discovers a giant robot and befriends him. Yes, in similar fashion to ET, the Hogarth tries to hide the giant from the authorities. Also like ET, he fails. However unlike that movie there is a great conflict between the giant and the military.This is a very heartwarming story and I am forever sad that there was never a sequel made to it, as it was worthy of another visit, yet the box office earnings were too low. My only problem with this film is that it is clearly meant to dissuade people from owning guns. Typical Hollywood bull, jamming their beliefs down our throats. All in all, this was a great movie though.",8,1,1,2 April 2020
The Silence of the Lambs," Hopkins' finest work
","I was 18 when this came out and newly discovering what I liked in movies. In adolescence I was held hostage by what my family wanted to watch. I only preface this with that information because this was the very first film in which I was introduced to Sir Anthony Hopkins. What an introduction.
This is a story of a young FBI Trainee, for lack of a better term, brought on board and investigation into the kidnapping and murder of women. Agent Starling, played here flawlessly by Jodi Foster, is a psyche major. She is asked to talk to a notorious serial murderer name Hannibal Lecter, or Hannibal the cannibal, played by the Great Hopkins. It is hoped that Lecter can shed some light on who is perpetrating the murders, as his latest kidnapped victim is a senator's daughter. Foster and Hopkins are excellent together, and the story is solid. It does keep you wondering through the end if Buffalo Bill, the serial killer's nickname, will get caught. But seriously, Hopkins is what made this movie. The man is an acting god.",9,2,3,15 November 2019
The Croods," What is wrong with some people?
","This is the story of a family of Neanderthals that live every day in fear. Everyone they knew had met an untimely end and Grug, the family's father is determined to keep them all alive. There are some problems in the form of teenage angst with Eep. Craving freedom she sneaks out one day and meets what I assume was Homoerectus, a guy named Guy. He tells her the end is coming and she tries to convince the family to follow Guy. The family is forced to go on an unwanted adventure, trying to concur their fears in order to survive and, pardon the pun, evolve to a new life. This movie features some great actors providing the voices of the characters, but Nick Cage shines as this seems like a role he was meant to voice.I read a review on here that said this film was 'insensitive, rude and mis-educational'. Not everything that our children watch needs to be educational. What is wrong with having fun? I suppose The Incredibles depicting super heroes living normal lives among us is educational? Or finding Nemo with talking fish and sharks that try not to eat fish, their sole source of nutrition? Stop taking life so serious. I feel sorry for the kids being raised like that. As for insensitive and rude, I do not get that either. Who would this movie insult? As far as I know Neanderthals are extinct. This family friendly movie showcases exactly how far a dad will go to protect his kids, and to me there is nothing more touching.",9,1,1,14 May 2020
Bruce Almighty," Extremely enjoyable film.
","The is the story of Bruce Nolan, played by Jim Carrey. Bruce is living with his girlfriend Grace played by Jennifer Aniston, and they have a comfortable life together, but Bruce wants more. Constantly looked over for more serious work as a news reporter because of his naturally goofy demeanor, he covets the news lead job that is coming open. When this falls through, Bruce goes on a self destructive rampage, cursing out God the entire time, even taunting him. As luck would have it, be it bad or good, God was listening. He bestows unto Bruce all his powers, to see if Bruce can do a better job of being God than God does. Bruce goes down the path of fixing his life to where he feels he should be, but looses Grace in the process.
Morgan Freeman who plays God, is about the most talented actor out there, and does not disappoint in this albeit small role. The story is great with a lot of laughs thrown in. And yes, there is a moral to this story as well.",8,4,4,19 November 2019
Signs," A slow drama with a lot of hidden signs
","This is my second favorite M. Night movie. It is deliberately slow paced so that the story can unfold. There is a subtle second story beneath the main plot, with well acted characters that you almost immediately become invested in. This is not an in your face movie, but like a lot of M. Night's work, makes you think for yourself. If you have not yet seen this, give it a go.",8,3,6,20 July 2019
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Episode IV Redux
","My review of this entry is simple, it is a New Hope redone with new characters and a couple of different twists. Does this make it bad? No. There is no such thing as a bad Star Wars film. The problem with the lifelong fans, of which I am, I was four when A New Hope was released, is that they want to recapture the awe and splendor that they experienced when Star Wars first came out. It will never happen people.",7,4,9,9 January 2020
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," The epic conclusion to the story
","Before I talk about this movie, I want to say that I got my aged grandmother hooked on the series. I would visit her every Saturday, and I brought the first two movies over on DVD and we watched them. She was hooked. Peter Jackson did such a good job bringing the books to life. Surely there was a lot left out, he would have needed six movies to fit in everything from these novels. I am happy to say that I brought my grandmother to the theater to see this when it came out, and for the entire run, she did not move an inch. To me that says all there can be said about this movie. To see a woman well in her 80, so transfixed was such a treat. This movie is sad and happy all at the same time and is wonderfully done.",10,3,4,1 November 2019
The Truman Show," Carrey's first serious role
","This is the first movie I saw where Jim Carrey plays it pretty straight laced and goes more dramatic. This movie is about the ultimate Big Brother television show. Truman Burbank is adopted by a network and his life is on full display 24 hours a day, seven days a week, all without his knowledge. He lives in a giant dome that recreates an island town. To prevent him wanting to leave, as a small child they instill a deep, fierce fear of the water. Every resident of the town is an actor, some of them having been there for the majority of their lives. Every interaction of his life is scripted as best they can, until one day Truman gets an inclination that not is all as it seems. While Truman struggles to find the truth, the world watches on.
While I have enjoyed watching this movie many a time, it does have one flaw, to me.Laura Linney, an actor that I have in all her other roles, seems miscast to me in the part of Truman's forced happy wife. Laura typically plays such a strong female lead that perhaps it was just her having to play an actress cowed into catering to Truman, a person she clearly dislikes, was what I did not like about her here. Were it not for this small flaw I would have given this 10 stars. This is a great look at mass consumption of media and the ultimate greed that is at the core of the human species.",8,2,2,22 November 2019
The Matrix," Just wow
","When this came out, I was living with a roommate. He went out and saw it, came home and said, 'Dude, you have to go see The Matrix.' So we left and he sat through it a second time. This movie is splendidly done. The mystery about what the Matrix is, unravels and you see a dystopian future unlike any we as a race would want. I have watched this over and over and never tire of it. Everyone does a great job acting in this, the special effects are above par and the story is engaging.",10,2,2,1 November 2019
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," What can one say?
","This movie is so ingrained into my DNA, it is almost a part of me. I was four years old, living in New Jersey when this came out, and I remember going to see it at the drive in. Back in those days, this was a summer movie. I remember vividly, as I lay on the roof of the family station wagon, the feeling of awe as the Tie Fighters flew across the screen. At one point in my life, I had seen this movie so often, that I would recite lines of dialog from start to finish with each character without messing one word up. This movie is so much more than a film about good versus evil, or family woes. This movie was the start of a universe, beloved by millions of people. On a shoestring budget with a little known director, came forth something that has yet to be repeated. All three of the original films were masterpieces in their own rights, but this is the one that captured everyone from the onset. Once a year, I sit down and watch this movie, that is only slightly younger than am I, and I have yet to tire of it.",10,3,5,22 October 2019
The Replacements," Do you hear footsteps Falco?
","Based on the NFL strike in the 80s, the Replacements is a movie of a bunch of people that missed their chance to play in the NFL getting to do that as replacement players or scabs. Keanu Reeves stars as quaterback Shane 'footsteps' Falco, Gene Hackman is a master in his role of the coahc Jimmy McGinty. The rest of the cast is very well done as well from Jon Favreau as the over excited defensive player to Rhys Ifans as Nigel 'the leg' Gruff the kicker. Almost every actor seems born to play the role they have. The team, led by Falco starts off rough but soon finds their groove and become a force. It all comes down to the last regular season game and the announcement that the players and the NFL have come to a deal. Will Falco finish the season with the team he built, or will he bow out?Really nothing new here for plot devices, but this movie is hilarious. It gets both thematic elements correct though. The drama is good when it needs to be and the comedy is well above par when needed.",8,4,4,12 February 2020
Get Him to the Greek," Hilarious and enjoyable
","Taking place after the event of Sarah Marshall, this movie deals with the fact that a no longer sober Aldis Snow is having career issues. Aaron Green works for Snow's record label, and is also a huge fan of Snow. He comes up with an idea of recreating Aldis' best concert at the Greek Theater to help reinvigorate things. His boss tasks him with getting Aldis to the Greek on time and Aldis is more interested in partying than following Aaron's game plan.
This movie made me laugh so many times and so hard, and it still does no matter how many times I've seen it. Russell Brand was born for this role. I really do not have anything negative to say, except maybe Puffy's acting was not the best but he did have several of the funniest jokes.",8,3,4,19 February 2020
Easy A," A poignant and witty comedy
","Olive is your average high school girl that just wants to make it through unscathed. In an attempt to avoid an unsavory experience with her bestie's parents (nudists) she makes up a story about a date with a college kid. One thing leads to another and Rhiannon elicits a false story from Olive about how she lost her virginity to the fake kid on the fake date. Things spiral out from there and Olive begins having fake sex with boys in her school to help their image. Olive ends up fully embracing the theme of the Scarlet Letter, dresses quite trashy and in the end losses all of her friends. Not straying too far from her though is Todd, a classmate that has loved Olive pretty much his entire life.I love Emma Stone and would watch anything in which she stars. She definitely shines here. This movie, though presented as a comedy, does show the perils of judging others. Great job done by all.",9,3,3,12 February 2020
Click," A beautiful blend of comedy with drama-warning, if you have a heart, you will cry
","Michael Newman has it all; a gorgeous wife that really loves him, two beautiful kids, a great home and a job he does well. Still he is not entirely satisfied with how his career is progressing and resents spending time away from big projects that might further him in the company.One night in a Bed Bath and Beyond, while looking for a universal remote for his TV, Michael runs into a guy named Morty. Morty is a bit odd, but gives Micheal the remote. Instead of being meant for a TV, this remote controls your life. Soon Michael is skipping life events that he dislikes and tries to only be present for the good parts.Before Michael understands what he has unleashed he is an old man, dying in a hospital and alone. Can he correct the error or his ways before he dies?Every damn time I watch this I cry. Why? Because it is so damn relatable. How many of us as kids could not wait to go to school? Then graduate so we can be adults and 'do whatever we want'? Then as adults, how many of us wish the work week would fly by, etc, etc, etc? Before you know it your kids are grown and you have lost a huge chunk of what little time we have on this planet. Watch this movie and learn something from it. Slow down and enjoy the small things, because that is what life is about. Now go hug your kids.",9,3,3,13 February 2020
Monty Python and the Holy Grail," The pinnacle of MP
","I love this group of fellows. Everything they do is gold and this is the gold icing on the golden cake of their projects. We have here a very satirical look at the quest for the Holy Grail that legend says King Arthur undertook during the crusades. Every last bit of this movie is tongue in cheek and highly intelligently funny. If you do not like this movie, it is simply because you did not get the humor.",9,3,3,20 November 2019
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," Best of the three
","Like the Wrath of Khan, Empire improves upon the first movie in the series. In fact, once all three were out, this remained the best of them. Often times the second movie of a trilogy feels more like a step that was needed to reach the conclusion rather than an adventure of its own. Empire succeeded where so many others failed, even in the modern trilogies. The characters are further developed, the special effects are ground breaking and the universe in which this is based is rich.",9,3,4,1 November 2019
A Walk to Remember," Every time I watch this, I cry.
","I am a guy, a man's man even. I like movies with action, and explosions and death. I love horror and sci-fi and mysteries. I do not like a lot of romance or chick flicks. I especially hate Nicolas Sparks. With all this being said, I freakin' love this move, and I am reduced to a blubbering mess each and every time I watch it. Perhaps it is the hopeless romantic that dwells deep within my jaded heart. I could not tell you, except the selfless love demonstrated in this movie is what I hope we can all find one day. I have not read the book, so I cannot say how well it is translated from one medium to the next, but the screenplay is very well written and it is supremely acted. Mandy Moore stole my heart with this film. Great little movie here.",9,2,3,22 October 2019
Gladiator," Another Ridley Scott masterpiece
","There is very little fault one can find in this film. It is the story of Maximus, a roman general who is betrayed by the son of his Caesar. After escaping execution, Maximus ends up fighting as a gladiator, with an eye for vengeance. Russell Crowe is magnificent in this role. He brings such poise and humility to the character, it is impossible not to be sympathetic. Joaquin Phoenix is equally as excellent in his role, and the polar opposite of Maximus. I would not only recommend this movie, but I would further insist that you watch the director's cut. It comes in at just under three hours of run time, but it will certainly not feel like it. I would put this in my top 10 movies you should see before you die list.",9,4,5,5 November 2019
The Birds," Hitchcock's finest.
","There are a lot of celebrated Hitchcock movies, but to me this is his best. The man against nature along with the slow build up are fantastic. This is a love story intermixed with a thriller. A chance encounter at a pet store between Melanie Daniels and Mitch Brenner causes Melanie to track him from San Francisco to Bodega Bay. It is here that people are mysteriously attacked by birds. It starts out slowly with a single bird attacking one person, to massed, planned attacks. A lot of modern viewers deride this as boring or cheesy, nut they need to look at it through the lens with which it was made in 1963. This is a gritty thriller that reminds us that we are not as superior as we think we are.",10,3,3,25 August 2019
