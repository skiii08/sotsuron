Blade Runner 2049," A Visual Feast
","I'm perplexed by the few low review ratings for Blade Runner 2049. It was an incredible film that brought just the right ambiance and visual quality that made the original intriguing. But here, Deakins and Villeneuve catapult this sequel into a beautifully artistic film. Ryan Gosling is perfectly cast as 'K' and Harrison Ford's return as Deckard is a vital component in the storytelling. The movie has deliberate and sustained pacing at 2 hours and 43 minutes but I never once checked my watch and the pacing made the experience that much more special. It is visually breathtaking and DP Roger Deakins, who is long overdue for an Oscar, deserves it 10-fold for the perfection he creates in Blade Runner 2049. Ana de Armas is exceptional as Joie. Watching her attempt to define and transform herself beyond K's submissive hologram makes her the heart of the film. Go, settle in, and let the movie take you in.",10,5,14,8 October 2017
