Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Star Wars Episode 0.5
","I went to the theater expecting to see a movie, instead I found a special effects show with dialog sandwiched in between to take up time.  The death of a *MAIN CHARACTER* takes up maybe 15 seconds of screen time.Characters where NOT introduced, they were assumed.And since when is star wars a comedy?  Are we supposed to believe an alien race on a distant planet, that lives underwater, no less, has adopted 'bad English' as their language?How is it that storm troopers of '40 years ago' are smaller, lighter, more intelligent, and have SHIELDS when the troopers with '40 years' more development time do not?The only good part of this movie was the restrictions placed on previews. This movie was hyped up to be the BEST movie ever, how DARE it not live up to its own hype.Obe One can do a pull up, using only his finger tips, and propel himself 40 feet in the air, but when he has to run about 10 feet in around 5 seconds he can't, leaving him conveniently trapped in a force field.Please, don't insult me Lucas.  And don't insult your 3 great Star Wars films.  Maybe you should have called it Star Wars Episode 1/2.",1,0,1,20 May 1999
