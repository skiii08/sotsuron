Men in Black 3," Better The Second Time Around
","I watched MIB 3 for the second time today and it was well worth the second chance for this movie. I never got to see it in 3D, but I'm not really sure that would be better or worse. The special effects are all good. I had previously rated this at 7 stars, but upgraded it this time to 9. Josh Brolin did a great job as the young Kay and Tommy Lee Jones as always came through with an excellent performance. Will Smith carries the movie, of course, doing Jay at his best. Don't believe any of the negative reviews (professional reviewers or others on IMDb). Make up your own mind about this one, and keep an open mind about time travel and all of its problems. And for goodness sake, remember this is just a movie and will not be perfect! Be entertained and enjoy!",9,2,4,26 March 2014
