Vertigo," Breathtaking
","I'm not much of a Alfred Hitchcock fan (not even sure I spelled his last name right:), but I do love Vertigo. It's exciting and chilling and surprising. All in once. I've only seen it once a long time ago but I've always wanted to see the movie again, which I'm gonna do soon. I've forgotten much of the movie. What I remember from most is that guy on the rooftops. And the music is amazing. Vertigo and Psycho must be the best works of Mr. Hitchcock. He is great when it comes to mystery and suspense. I wish it could be shown at the theater again. It would be worth it or I wish the TV could show Vertigo a little more than Psycho. They send that one a lot more and I'm kind of tired of Psycho.",8,2,5,16 June 2006
Se7en," A little creepy but very boring!
","To be honest, I don't understand what's so great about the movie. I've never seen the whole movie. I don't know why. I always give up watching it during the movie 'cause it bores me. I don't find it exciting at all. Just two policemen chasing a guy. I've seen similar movies that are way thrilling than this. And the reason why the guy is killing are stupid. It's just not inspiring enough for me to make me sit down and watch the whole thing. I always end up zapping on another channel or pick up a book to read. Morgan Freeman is a wonderful actor. He's the reason why I'm trying to see the movie every time it goes on TV. But not even him can make me interested to make it through to the end. And Brad Pitt. I can't stand that guy. He's not that good as he think he is.",3,3,9,16 June 2006
"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"," Lost magic
","I'd like the TV series better than the movie itself. Even though the effects were thousand times better than the TV-series, I think the TV-series got a whole a lot of charm than the Hollywood production. The effects were too overwhelming and a little too much, to actually care about them all. The characters are simply drowning in all the visual effects. I just lost interest in what was going on and I just couldn't keep up to the end 'cause I just didn't care about what was going to happen to them. The kids could get eaten by the bad wolf for that matter. I just couldn't believe their characters. I don't exactly what's wrong with the movie, basically everything. It's trying to be Lord of the Ring like but it just don't work. It just fit better in smaller production. But this is my opinion. It was just nothing that I expected it to be. The magic was gone.",3,0,1,10 June 2006
Ice Age: The Meltdown," Not as funny as first one
","Scratch is never a disappointment. The scenes where he always is chasing the nut and never get the hands on it cracks me up. Can't help it. It's just so funny, but beyond that the movie is nothing special really.Ice Age 2 is more slow going than the first time. It takes a bit longer from time to them that will make you laugh. It's not so hysterical. And their lines is not that funny as the last one either. It's almost like they used all their good materials in the first movie and then used the other parts that wasn't good enough in the first movie, and saved it to the sequel. It's not that hilarious. It's just some movie you will forget you have seen in a couple of days. I have. I think the sequel is most funny for the kids.",4,1,1,11 June 2006
The Others," Beautiful
","Finally a horror movies for adults. I'm so sick and tired of these really bad teenagers horror flicks and was so relieved to finally get to see a mature horror movies with adults. It was so good. I loved the good old fashioned atmosphere that is suppose to have in a horror movie, like old nice house, the fog around it and the shadows that lurks in every corner. Who doesn't think that is scary? I do. Nicole Kidman were wonderful as usual. And the ending were surprising and amazing. It gives you the creeps and might ask yourself: am I really alive? When you see the movie, you will understand what I mean. And that's what's creepy with the movie. You never know what to expect.",Null,0,1,15 June 2006
Brokeback Mountain," *Yawn*
","I saw this movie at the theater with a friend of mine. We wanted to see it basically that we have heard many people say great things about it and we had high expectations for it. So, we saw it and we both got disappointed. The movie were two slow going. It was sweet with the two men that tried to deny that they were in love with each other and all - but beyond that there was not much special in the movie. It was kind of looking like a nature documentary for cowboys or something. The performances impressed me - I have to admit that. I knew Jake Gyllenhall would be great and Heath Ledger surprised me cause I had just seen him in 10 things I hate about you and he didn't do it so well there. You should see this movie if you don't get anything better to do...I just got so disappointed cause people were telling me aw it's so sweet and it's a movie you won't forget and on and on so I was expecting something big. But it was nothing more than slow going nature movie with two 'cowboys' enjoying their companies together way up in the mountain.",2,2,38,10 June 2006
The Hills Have Eyes," Been there, seen that....
","Oh my god, oh my god, the family car breaks down. What the hell are we gonna do. Let's split up. We'll walk to the next gas station which is miles and miles away, we'll just bring some water and walk. The rest of the family stay right here! Nothing will go wrong! Yeah right. But they don't know about the lurkers sitting on the hills, watching them, waiting for the right moment to get the poor family that are stranded in the desert. First, they take the dog, the easiest trade.How many times haven't we seen this before? How many cars will break down and the people in it will get attacked by some mountain freak one by one? How many times has Hollywood planned to make remakes of horror flicks? When are they gonna try to come up with a new story plot by themselves and try to surprise the audience instead of giving us what's going to happen next with a spoon. We've basically seen all that before and I want to see something new. Please, Hollywood, I know you can do it.",3,0,2,10 June 2006
Million Dollar Baby," Eastwood does it again!
","First of all I just wanna say that I hate everything about sports and the reason why I wanted to see it is because Clint Eastwood directed it. And after seeing Mystic River, I wanted to see Million Dollars Baby cause Clint Eastwood is an incredible director that brings the actors in his movies in good light. I had only seen Hilary Swank in Boys don't cry so I didn't knew much about her but she just blew me away. They way she talked and living herself into that part were just amazing. I believed her. She's brilliant for being so young. And giving her an Oscar was the right thing to do. Also, Morgan Freeman. He's so ordinary in that movie and brilliant. You just wanna feel sorry for him for being so alone in the movie. I mean living in the gym? Who wants that? The story is gripping and you just wanna comfort them all. Everything in that movie is so human. It's all about making it through the day no matter how hard that is. And sometimes, you just want it all to take it all in the end but you just need a little help to make that happen. It's all about that. It makes you think what would I've done if I was him or her.",10,1,2,10 June 2006
Saw II," Not as fabulous as the first one
","A group of strangers get trapped together in a room and have to find a way out before they get killed by the gas Jigsaw has filled the room with.First of all I want to say that I had high expectations for this movie since I loved Saw so much. I saw the sequel last night, and I had mixed feelings about it after seeing it. I still think that the first Saw is better because of its magic and the performance of Johns' voice. The second movie I kind of knew what was going to happen, cause John wants to kill these person of the same reason as the first Saw. He wants them to find out how much they appreciate their lives. I felt like there was something missing when I was watching the sequel. It didn't have the same magic effect of suspense and shock as the first one. And Jigsaw was suddenly not so scary anymore. Just a poor guy in a chair, waiting to die. In the first movie he was so brutal, clever and many twists and turns with a brilliant ending I loved so much -- but all of that was like gone when I saw the sequel. I guess I got kind of disappointed. It just didn't have the same 'charm' but the conversation between Jigsaw and Matthews were unforgettable.",6,0,2,23 June 2006
Saw," This movie will thrill you...
","One of the reasons why I love this movie so much is because I finally get to see a movie with a brilliant ending. This movie is one of the shocking and unbelieving movie you will see, and you will never guess who the killer is. And this killer has a good reason for killing people. They don't appreciate life and he wants to do something with it. If you like movies with lots and lots of gore, humour and blood you will like this one. I swear. Saw is one of the best scarymovies I've seen in a long time, 'cause I'm sick and tired of Wes Craven and Kevin Williams movie that makes fun of movies in this genre. But Saw takes it serious from first to last step. Enjoy!",10,0,1,3 June 2006
Mystic River," A movie about lost friendship.
","At first I was kind of skeptical before I saw this movie, 'cause I never been a fan of Eastwood or drama itself for that matter, but the the title of the movie and the beautiful layout made me curious. So, I decided to see it. I didn't only see it once, but twice in a row. This movie is about three friends that never be the same again after one of them get taken away by a man that likes to have sex with young boys. Years later they reunite when one of their daughter get murdered and one of them are a policeman that is going to be investigating the case. After seeing the movie, I quickly became a huge fan of Eastwood cause he showed me a talent I've never seen before that he is a great director and how he brought all the actors so well together. And it also amaze me that Eastwood also composed the beautiful background music that wanted me to by the soundtrack. His son, Kyle Eastwood, also has composed a few great songs on the soundtrack, and Cosmo is one of them. A very cool jazz melody. All in all, this is a movie that will sit in you a long time after seeing it, with the help of bringing up important subjects as pedophile and friendship that changes. I saw this movie for the first time last summer and it still moves me.",9,1,2,3 June 2006
Carrie," Creepy
","A misunderstood teenage girl is going through a hard time by her class girlfriends always making fun of her. There's nothing wrong with that girl. She's just a little different that's all. Even though it's not her fault, she has to pay for it. Carrie is a movie that shows how difficult it is to be a teenage girl at times and how it is to be made fun of by her own classmates. But she has abilities that many teenage girls doesn't have: she's strong enough to ignore it and pretend like nothing. Her classmates is even cruel enough to do a terrible mistake to her on the prom night. When she finally get the feeling that she fit in, they ruin it by doing something nasty that makes Carries abilities to make something near her explode when something goes very wrong. It will make the classmates regret for everything they have done to her 'cause at that point it's to late to forgive and forget.",8,1,1,11 June 2006
A Nightmare on Elm Street," Whatever you do. Don't fall asleep!
","This is the movie that made me fall in love with horror movies. After seeing some parts of the movie as a little girl before I had to go to bed, I was waiting for another horror movie to come back on the TV soon 'cause I had discovered a new genre. Horror. Why can't kids watch horror? I couldn't wait to get older when I could see more movies like that. It was exciting. Giving me the chills were a thrill. I wanted to see more. And ever since that I have loved horror movies. I even have the entire A nightmare on elm street collection and I've seen them more than once. Freddy Krueger is not like the other killers in horror flicks (like Friday 13th and Halloween) He doesn't walk slowly after the poor teenagers and refuse to talk. He's the opposite of it. He runs after them and say sarcastic things. That's what I love about him. His mouth is full of sarcasm.",9,0,0,16 June 2006
Jurassic Park," M for Magic!
","How can't people love this movie? I saw it when it came to the theater in 1994, begging my mom to please take me to the theater to see the movie and she did. And during the movie I was just staring at the screen in amazement. So many dinosaurs and believed they were real, cause I didn't know much about computers too:)After seeing the movie I was falling in love with dinosaurs. I bought a Jurassic Park movie gallery book, cards, and even a bed sheet. I just thought the movie was so real and believed that the dinosaurs were alive.Even though I don't think that anymore, Jurassic Park is still my fave movie of all time. Idon't understand why people doesn't appreciate it so much as they did at that time, maybe 'cause the audience just has grown up and just think it's childish.I don't know. I'm 23 years old now and I love the movie just as much now cause the plot is great and the actors are funny and coming so well together and there's something always happening.What I love about the movie is all the sarcasm I didn't get when I saw it for the first time and my fave scene in the movie is the two kids in the kitchen getting chased by the two dinosaurs. (don't remember what kind of dinosaurs). No movie can compare to this one by its original plot and magical effects. Who doesn't think the dinosaurs are real when they see the movie, no matter what age?",10,3,5,10 June 2006
