Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," PotC 4 ...a new beginning
","Action, adventure, romance, and comedy all fit into this one magnificent movie. The fourth installment of Pirates of the Caribbean is an excellent family or teenage movie. ofcours some questions remain unquestioned but this is a different director from the previous three movies. All is good with captain Jack(Johnny Depp), once again he seems to be looking for a source of youth, the elixir of life, more specific The Fountain of Youth, but of coarse some other being is in search of the same item. Blackbeard(Ian McShane)and Barbossa(Geoffrey Rush). in quest of a crew Jack seems to inquire himself with a past lover, Angelica(Penelope Cruz) there is one problem though she seems to be Blackbeard's daughter. Held captive on his ship, Jack is forced to guide them through the dangers of the path to the Fountain. I find that the actors portray their characters excellently and each one of them capture the audiences attention. In place of William and Elizabeth there is a new, heartwarming romance between Phillip(Sam Claflin) and Syrena(Astrid Berges-Frisbey). They seem to nail the role of outcasts from their own kind, and yet every moment i saw the two being tortured or harmed in a scene it gave emotion and commitment. Like I've said before the plot had specific questions unanswered. What happens to Anelica after being marooned on an island, what ever happened to the rest of the crew from the Black Pearl (besides barbossa), and what happens to Phillip after Syrena drags him under the sea? Perhaps these questions will be answered in the next installment of PotC, along with better reviews. Besides the cast and storyline, the locations were beautiful and it was, over all, a thrilling adventure to sit through.",8,1,2,2 June 2011
X-Men: First Class," great comeback..:)
","I had just come out of the movie theaters frowning after watching this movie..not that it was bad (believe me it wains't).X-men:first class is an exceptional prequel with many moments of romance, action and drama. half way through the movie i realize that this prequel is better than any other x-men installment. The previous two installments were quite a disappointment. But this one gave its all. All of the acting was believable and best of all the action and story made it even better. James McAvoy plays Charles Xavier and delivers a convincing portrayal of any young mutant. As for Jennifer Lawerance who portrays Mystique, her chemistry towards Beast (Nicholas Hoult) is heart warming and believable as well. As the movie begins it directly displays the image of a concentration camp during the first world war involved with Nazis, so you know there will be some brutal behavior,(duh, its X-men). Eric's(Michael Fassbender) revenge and sadness in the movie really touched the hearts of many of the audience as he delivered a sense of vengeance. The rest of the story , you have to see for yourself, i wont give more away. But what is a must to say is that this is a summer movie not to miss.",10,1,3,12 June 2011
