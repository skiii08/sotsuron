The Blair Witch Project," This insults my intelligence.
","I can't believe any of this. One, who would agree to take part in the making of this? And two, who would pay money to view one of the worst movies ever made? (That is strictly my opinion and I know that I am pretty much the only person that hates this so bear with me.)When The Blair Witch Project first came out on video to rent, I did rent it. I had heard such rave reviews about it so I couldn't resist. Took it home, watched it, and almost hit myself for allowing me to stoop to such low standards. What can I say? It was definitely the most ridiculous film I have ever seen. I just don't understand what they even attempted at making this. Yes, they were trying to recreate the real story by mixing in stuff with previous knowledge, but I don't think that this is something capable of being recaptured on tape. Am I the only one that looks for smart, meaningful movies? I want to watch a movie that has some decent writing, an interesting plot, some REAL actors, and NOT a home video that I could have just as easily shot. Is today's society and film goers really this generic? I'm using generic because you couldn't ask for anything more simpler. This is a home movie with no point to it. As to the people who claim this is frightening and/or scary, you have no idea of what scary is. After I saw this, every time I would hear someone say that they were so scared throughout the whole film, I just wanted to give them a copy of...well, something besides this that WAS scary.
A lot of words can be used to describe The Blair Witch Project and I can't think of any good ones. Just when I thought that it couldn't get any worse, it did. The ending was such a ridiculous let down. They go down to the basement, the camera drops, and poof! it's over. Maybe if this film had some writing  (besides the 'f' word), some talented actors, an interesting story to go off of, and just about everything else needed for a movie, it might stand a chance. This was ruined way before it was ever released at the theaters.The only thing this movie gave me was a headache. The constant movement of the camera along with that so scary running scene through the dark was as poorly created as you can get. Another thing it made me want to do was yell at Heather telling her to wipe the damn snot off her nose.",Null,0,1,8 December 2000
Erin Brockovich," (yawn)
","What was this?  Nominated for best picture, best screenplay, Julia Roberts won the academy for her portrayal of Brockovich?  I don't think so.  See, this is where the wonderful world of entertainment and myself have a little differ of opinion when it comes to good movies.  THIS was not one of them.I will never understand why celebrities are paid these big bucks just because they can memorize some lines.  You throw in some movie previews that you think the public should see in order to waste seven, eight dollars, and suddenly, you have a money making picture all because you had the brains to hire one of the biggest (and overrated) actors in the show business.Why did everybody, and when I say 'everybody' I mean the academy awards association, think that this picture was deserving to be nominated for an oscar?  I suppose I should have seen this one coming considering that they gave the lousy 'American Beauty' the gold statue the year before. 
I think that I am about the only person who doesn't like Roberts.  I don't like the roles she picks, her acting ability isn't exactly golden, and I hate how everyone thinks that she is the number one actress around nowadays. Will somebody explain to me why she was exactly nominated for the best actress award?  You got her running around like a hooker for two+ hours.  I thought that we had already covered the whole hooker thing in 'Pretty Woman.'  She goes prancing around the town in heels that she can barely stand up in.  And the thing that made this story look bad was that no matter how tight the money was and whenever times got tough, we never see Brockovich wear the same outfit twice.  Here she is looking all over for a job and complaining that she's got three kids to feed but just how poor was she if her wonderful wardrobe of mini skirts and tank tops never came to a repeat?  There went the movie.  I can't really comment on the rest of the cast because there wasn't any! Yeah, sure Masry was a good size part but scene after scene I had to put up with looking at Roberts' face.  Brockovich's snappy come backs and rude one liners began to run dry during the first twenty minutes of the film.  I'll admit that some evoked a slight laughter from me but not a whole lot.  I got a little tired of hearing f___ this and f___ that, but what can you do?  I'm just wondering that if another actress had portrayed Erin Brockovich, would this movie have gotten the same amount of publicity?  The story line, even though it was based on a true story, was very bland.  All you have here is a non-educated mother of three who is trying to support her family when she comes along a case of water contamination and decides to bring it to the surface.  She wins, the water drinkers get a pay off, she gets a pay off and we're all really happy.  The movie ended too quick and then I was forced to listen to that dumb song by Sheryl Crow.  Just some last comments:  The problem the movie crew had here was that they tried to make a movie out of something that didn't need to be made.  There wasn't enough information given about the case and it more or less focussed on Roberts playing a half dressed lawyer-type.  The lack of music was another thing that annoyed me.  How could they possibly make a soundtrack? And somebody want to tell me what they spent their $51 million budget on? The most creative thing that this movie had was the real E.B. in a cameo named 'Julia.'  Oh, how do they come up with these things!?  Final words: This movie was given too much credit all because it had the overrated Julia Roberts in the lead/only role.  Critics never know what they're talking about and I should never listen to the academy again.  Don't watch this!",3,2,8,18 April 2001
L.A. Confidential," It's a pretty good film.
","'L.A. Confidential' is a good film.  It's a bit long, but I can overlook that.  The plot is interesting (my goal is to read the book in the near future), and the cast is good, I suppose.I actually like the direction that the film takes.  I can't say that I'm a big fan of the cop films, but this one seems to have me hooked.  I have to admit that I was somewhat confused in some parts; some areas just didn't piece together well.  Oh, and being that the entire cast, except for Kim Basinger, is male, I had a hard time remembering who was who.  Luckily, I caught on after a while.  Anyway, Curtis Hanson did a great job.  That right there is probably the biggest compliment one will hear from me that is directed toward a director.Overall, the cast did a terrific job.  I have some complaints though.  Kevin Spacey was good as he is in any other film.  He's good, I would have liked to have seen some more of him, but he could have been a whole lot better. Worthy of an Oscar nomination?  No.  Russell Crowe was just a tad better than Spacey.  Again, being that the film focuses on several different characters and their point of views, I just didn't see enough of him to really stand up and applaud.  Worthy of an Oscar nomination?  No.  Guy Pearce was excellent.  He was listed third, but in my opinion his name should have been at the top of the credits list.  I think that there was more of him on screen more than any of the other actors, which is why I liked him so much.  Worthy of an Oscar nomination?  Absolutely, but unfortunately, he didn't get one.  Kim Basinger was horrible.  I can't say any more except that she was boring.  Everyone acts as if her role was huge and so important to the film itself, but it wasn't.  Worthy of an Oscar nomination?  No way!  Alright, now I'm mad.  Can't really figure out why Danny DeVito got such rave reviews and James Cromwell was lame. 
Now that the minor questions have been answered, the main one needs an answer.  Was 'L.A. Confidential' worthy of an Oscar for Best Picture?  Well, the nomination was definitely well-deserved, but I don't know if I'd go all the way and say that yes, this film actually deserved the title of Best Picture.  Being that it was up against 'Titanic' that year is probably the only reason I'm going to say that it didn't deserve the award.  If 'Titanic' hadn't been in the running, then sure, it should have gotten it.Like I said, Curtis Hanson did a wonderful job.  He deserved the director's nod, and I think that he, too, should have won the Oscar, but James Cameron walked away the winner in ways more than one.  So, I would recommend 'L.A. Confidential' to others if they don't mind sitting down for a while.  The cast is good, the director did an outstanding job, and the plot in general is interesting.",Null,0,1,11 January 2003
The Beach," A mixed movie.
","Here's my thought of 'The Beach':  Half of it was good while the other half drowned out the good parts.I saw this movie for one reason and one reason only, Leonardo DiCaprio is in the main role. Everyone always criticizes DiCaprio's performance in almost every movie that he makes. Well, I absolutely adore him. 'What's Eating Gilbert Grape', 'Basketball Diaries', 'Titanic' and yes, 'The Beach' all show him acting out his best. In my opinion, DiCaprio is one of the most talented actors around. Argue with me but I really think he does his best in almost every role. Once again, HE didn't let me down, but this movie sure did. The first part (not the entire first half) was decent and it looked like 'The Beach' could make a name for itself. The plot started to carry on with little meaning and that's where I got bored with it. Although the beginning narration started off slow, it also started out with nice scenery and a good script trying to break through. Three characters hit the island and then the film started to pick up. We skip ahead to where Richard starts eating bugs, he turns into a video game character and starts hissing like a cat. Okay, that's enough. 'The Beach' was kind of lost from then on. We skip ahead some more to the ending, and like the beginning, it too was slow. In fact, it was a terrible ending. The script itself could have been good, I'm not saying great, but good for the most part. It went in one direction while what the characters were doing and saying went into another. It seemed as if the whole thing started to lose meaning at one point or another.
The acting was very good. I already gave my opinion on DiCaprio's half, so let me talk about the rest of the cast. Virginie Ledoyen who plays Françoise, was just alright. Her character wasn't really given a lot of attention to but what she was given, she handled well. I really liked the man who played Françoise's boyfriend, Étienne I think. He too didn't contribute a whole lot to the plot but I thought that he was a good actor. I did not like how his character just disappeared about half way through the film. Why did they do that? Keep him around. I won't comment too much on Tilda Swinton (Sal) except to say that she is one of the most annoying actresses I have ever seen. Little tip: 're-cast.' Everyone else did good.One of the worst things about this film was the narration. Richard telling the story through his eyes started to get boring. The part where he's out in the woods, keeping an eye on those four travelers is when it hit me the most. For ten or so minutes, he does nothing but narrate and we really don't see too much action. Another thing that seemed to irritate me was those darn flashbacks to Daffy in his room. There he is firing away at the tourists with Richard screaming beside him. Oh, that was one of the terrible parts.
This movie had beautiful scenery, a decent script (that got screwed up some how) and so-so special effects. Again, Leonardo DiCaprio isn't what made 'The Beach' bad, the writing was.",Null,0,1,8 August 2001
American Pie," This is a joke, right?
","I've seen some bad films, but this one walks away with the award. If I was part of the cast, I would be ashamed to have even taken part in something this ludicrous. If I was part of the crew, I would die mainly because I am too stupid to think of anything more funny-realistic-intelligent etc.What I would really like to know is how this film got an R rating. The majority of the viewers would more than likely be teenagers. I can't see any normal adult sitting through a movie that ruins the image of *some* good teen flicks. This was definitely not meant for teenagers. Any parent that allows their son/daughter to see this needs their head examined. Is this really what the film industry is becoming? I know that it used to be frowned upon if a married couple slept in the same bed. We're talking a while back, but you get the idea. If this is something that is thought of as quality movie making, I hate to see what's to come.Being a teenager, I really don't get why so many people my age found this sort of trash amusing. It had the typical high school beauties, lack of comedy (despite what MANY people thought), lack of intelligence, a terrible script to start out with, and poor casting overall. For those of you who found this sort of thing funny, what were you thinking? And I must ask, how can the same joke seem to be pleasing for the entire film? A couple of losers are dying to lose their virginity, yeah, yeah, yeah. Heard it before. The whole joke revolving around the pie incident is down right disgusting.There's nothing more irritating than watching a movie where there is not one normal face in the crowd. The cast is by no means beautiful, but it just so happens that the actress chosen to strip for the camera isn't exactly an old hag. And why did they even have to do that little stunt? In one word to describe the cast: un-talented. If the writing was supposed to be comical, mission not accomplished. The casting department needs some tips on how to cast actors and not just some twenty somethings that are supposed to be playing high schoolers. I can't repeat on how the movie lacked comedic writing, but I just can't get over how people actually laughed at this. The writing overall was awful. It was actually funny to think that something like this has an $11 million budget. What was Universal Pictures thinking when they agreed to make this? At that point, they must have been hanging on by a thread. The idea that a high school boy supposedly has sex with a pie is beyond words. It wasn't funny but very gross. The thought of a guy actually doing that is absurd. I wonder how many boys tried that after they watched this? The whole movie basically revolved around that one thing. You can only stretch it so far.
Again, this film with little sex jokes and actions slipped in was very disturbing especially when it was allowed to be shown to kids that are waiting to do them. When I had heard about the apple pie, I thought that the film was in serious trouble. But then it got worse when I was able to see a little strip tease. How I wish this scene would have been skipped. I for one didn't particularly appreciate that. I mean it's only fair if they show a guy. Right? Everything else like the parts with Vicky and what's-his-name were also dumb.It's pretty bad when movies like this are made. All I can say is that lets hope no more teen, bottom of the barrel films will be made. If the makers and industry people are this desperate, save the money for when a decent flick comes along. Why waste the money and the movie goers' time?",Null,1,2,21 January 2001
Grease," It's gradually good.
","It actually took me a number of years to watch 'Grease' in its entirety.  I first saw it many years ago but never did I get the chance to finish it. Needless to say it took about four or five more tries until I saw the whole thing.  Personally, it's the kind of movie that is bad at first, but by a couple of full screenings, it's good.Well, I like it now.  The cast is great, the songs are fun and addicting, and the singing and the dancing (but specifically the singing because some of those actors just could not sing even though I like ALL of them) are a little weak but I guess there has to be a low point to every movie.
John Travolta and Olivia Newton-John are perfect together.  They make a perfect team.  I know that they're the main characters, but I've got to really hand it to the entire cast because this is one of those casts that just clicks.  Everybody is wonderful, even those actors with the tiniest of roles.While the plot is a little iffy, it somehow pulls through probably because of all those entertaining dance/sing sequences.  All of those scenes are choreographed and performed well.  And you know what?  Any movie that leaves a song, or in this case, a number of songs, in my head well after the film has ended is okay by me.  Yeah, it's a little annoying how there ARE so many darn songs throughout 'Grease', but that's what makes it good, I suppose.Everything else such as set decoration (yes, I have to point that out because it looked very good), and the actual writing, though limited due to the movie actually being a musical, were great.  It's safe to say that I like 'Grease.'  I wouldn't go as far as to say that it's one of the best movies ever made, but it is good.  It took me a while to finally watch the whole thing, but I'm glad I did because it's...fun.",Null,0,1,18 January 2003
American Psycho," Oh, what have we done?
","This movie had the potential to be something really great. Perhaps one of the best movies of the year. But something was missing that turned 'American Psycho' into an absolute joke. I have not read the story and don't intend to after watching the film. They're probably different but I've had enough of the 'American' all together. The plot and direction of the movie seemed good and could have gone somewhere if the studio people hadn't done such a hack job of what they had to work with. They (writers, producers, directors, actors) screwed this film up in more than one way. The writing was terrible. I thought that it seemed to drift off and go into a different direction than what the story was going into. There were a lot of comments and one-liners put into the script that made no sense whatsoever. The movie's time could have been cut in half and would have covered the same amount of material. The acting was good in some parts. Now this was the first time that I had seen Christian Bale in anything before. His acting was tolerable but nothing special. The smartest thing that this film had was a lesser known actor in the lead role. Even though the setting and story called for a strange and unusual man to play the part of Patrick Bateman, the character's speech and actions were to dull and slow for the movie. I disliked the film for another reason pertaining to the actors and characters. Bale was the only real person who had an input into the movie. He delivered almost all of the lines and was in almost every scene. The film showed a number of business buddies to the killer but none of them really had anything to do with the film except for the character of Paul Allen played by Jared Leto. This role was messed up from the very beginning. We were introduced to him but really never learned anything about him. Before you know it he's dead and we're left listening to Phil Collins is it? Before I saw this film, I pictured it as one with a lot of killings. After all, it is titled 'American Psycho'. Wrong. We were shown very little as to how the bodies pile up. A murder here and maybe another one to come but there was just nothing to it. Once nearing the end, I thought that the film would take a turn for the better and would end up being a huge surprise. Wrong again. It ended at the drop of a hat and never really explained what happened to the main character. A lot of questions were never answered and this was probably the worst part of the film. (Like there were any good ones?)I must say that I was surprised as to how I reacted to the film. I pictured a really interesting, scary movie but it was nothing more than a good story line trying to break through an awful script. This seems to be the trend nowadays. Hollywood just keeps destroying possibly terrific movies.
'American Psycho' was just too slow for my liking. The beginning started off slow, the middle ran dry and the end was a total disappointment. The previews that I had seen showed an entirely different movie than what I actually saw. It wasn't a good one. Avoid this movie and try a real horror.",Null,0,0,17 July 2001
American Beauty," This is what won Best Picture?
","I know I'm a little outnumbered here, but this is one of the most boring and overrated films I have ever seen. This is the winner of Best Picture, along with being said that it is one of the best movies of all time? How exactly is this possible?When I had seen the trailer for American Beauty, I immediately wanted to see the film. I'm the kind of person who waits for the movie to come out on video, so I can view it at my own speed because I usually like to watch parts of it more than once to get the full understanding of them. I had heard so much about the movie, and after it racked up the Oscars, I was forced to rent it. I did and boy, was I ever disappointed.What is so great about it? So it's a tale about a man who is unhappy with his life and decides to change it in many ways. My life isn't exactly the most perfect, and at times, I too would like to change something about it. Everybody probably does. If I wrote my thoughts down on paper along with some characters and intelligent writing, do you think that I could sell it to a production company?Let's discuss this movie in sections. The actors did a well job with the parts they were given. I'll admit that Kevin Spacey portrayed Lester Burnham in an excellent way and deserved the Oscar that he earned. Annette Bening made a disaster of her character, Carolyn. I thought that in every scene she was in, she tried to steal the show. Her character's story and problems were kind of bland if you compare them to Lester's. I was so glad to see that the Best Actress award didn't go to Annette for her ridiculous role. Thora Birch, who I have always liked, did a very good but not terrific job as Jane Burnham. Her character is complex and that was about the only thing I liked about this film. It does a pretty good job of describing what a teenager is like. The stuck-up Angela Hayes, played by Mena Suvari was the worst part of American Beauty. All I wanted to do was slap her, which was good because the character really spoke to the audience. I didn't like anything about the lines or actions she said/did. Wes Bentley was all-right but I didn't like his character and thought that the movie would have been a lot better off without his story line. I realize that it would have left out a ton of significant situations and plots to each character, but I don't know, it really didn't fit into the Burnham's problems.Why was the plot and main idea given such rave reviews? Hard times after another came for the always depressed and suffering Lester Burnham. Yeah, yeah, the poor guy realizes that his life is pathetic and then his wife and daughter also have some problems. ALMOST everybody goes through mid-life crisis, but for some reason, this guy really stood out. Why?The different problems that the characters go through are quite interesting, yet very odd. Carolyn's affair, Jane's encounter with the boy next door, Lester's obsession with Angela, smoking pot, working out, etc., etc., etc., were all amusing and entertaining to watch. Perhaps, the thing I liked most about American Beauty was the conclusion. The whiplash ending happened fast and probably caught everybody else off guard. Finally, American Beauty was put to rest. (Well in my house anyways.)",1,9,22,5 December 2000
54," Ryan and the film overall is good.
","First off I would like to mention that I wasn't born until many years after 54 closed its doors. So, I don't really have anything to compare the film to. But despite of not knowing about the real club, I enjoyed the movie very much.Many people criticize '54' saying that it did a terrible job of depicting the actual club scene while others commend it for bringing the New York happening spot to life. All I know is that I love anything 60s and 70s so I obviously liked this film. The clothes are good, the music is better than today's and Studio 54 looked like THE place to be. The story line following a New Jersey nobody seems pretty simple. He hits New York, visits the club and in no time is the bartender. I thought that it was an excellent choice in casting Ryan Phillippe in the role of Shane O'Shea.Phillippe's role doesn't look like it needed a whole lot of work put into because once again, it is a simple picture of a young man set out to make something of himself. But he does his best nonetheless. O'Shea was created well. Another young actor I particularly like is Breckin Meyer. He did a very good acting job but there was something wrong with his character. Greg seemed as if he had a purpose there in the beginning but after a while he slowly moved into the darkness and just became someone who hooked Shane up with a place to stay. Salma Hayek seems to be a popular name now days. I must say that I'm not too interested in seeing her anything. I've seen her in one or two movies before seeing her in '54' and I still don't get why everybody likes her. Not good acting on her part. Neve Campbell who is definitely not one of my favorite actresses plays a minor role in this film but they make it seem like she's in the lead. I won't comment too much on her since she once again chose a bad character to act out. And Mike Myers who plays the club owner, Steve Rubell, probably does the best next to Ryan Phillippe. It's not that Myers is such a terrific actor, it's just that he didn't have any competition (sorry Breckin). But still he played out the role his best. The cast was pretty good overall. I thought that the re-creation of Studio 54 was very good. Again, I didn't know the real one but it looked so fantastic in there. Lights, dancing, music, it seemed as if the people had it made. The score for the movie wasn't anything too too great. The music was good, don't get me wrong, but I've heard better. So, the story line following O'Shea was good. The acting was mixed with some good some bad. The writing was decent and the script as a whole was one of the better ones. See this even if you aren't familiar with the club itself. '54' gives a pretty good idea of what went on and how it finally came to an end.",7,1,2,9 August 2001
Mulholland Drive," This film is without a doubt, the worst I have ever seen.
","Everyone seems to love 'Mulholland Dr.' for reasons that I will apparently never understand.  I had been wanting to see this movie for a while and I finally did.  Not only did I lose $3.50 to Hollywood Video, but I think that I actually lost brain cells in the viewing of this entirely overrated garbage that should have been left on the cutting room floor. 
First off, how this trash made it onto the Top 250 list (it's currently 128) is beyond me.  I've read many critics' reviews just because I wanted to see if there was anyone else in the world that agreed with me by saying that 'Mulholland Dr.' should never have been made.  Well, I didn't have too much luck.What exactly was David Lynch on when he was sitting in the director's chair? Now this is the first film by Lynch that I have ever seen, so naturally a couple of people might think that it is unfair to judge him by going off of only one movie.  I don't care what anybody says, he's a terrible director and you couldn't pay me (well, I suppose if the price was right...) to view any of his other films.I'll be honest, I thought that the film was going to be really good due to the first ten minutes alone.  It started off slow but I figured that it would pick up and be non-stop action from then on out.  Wrong.  It dragged on and on and I continued to check the clock about every two minutes just to make sure that I was still awake.  I was on the verge of slipping into a deep sleep many of times.  I was actually still interested in 'Mulholland Dr.' up to the point where Betty finds Rita in her aunt's apartment.  It was all downhill from there.The acting was surprisingly good.  Too bad it was wasted on such an awful project.  Naomi Watts is fairly good to watch.  She was a bit annoying at times, but I would see her again in one of her other films.  Laura Elena Harring was so bad.  It seems unreasonable to come down on her when I rave about Watts' performance, but it's not my fault that she was boring to watch.  Justin Theroux was entertaining.  His character was a mess, but I still enjoyed him.  The cast was good, could have been better, alright, it was average.'Mulholland Dr.' is freaky.  It is down right weird.  We all know that.  The thing is, is that there are entirely too many twists and turns.  Lynch doesn't know when to stop.  It looks as if he wanted the entire film to be set as a complete 'illusion' instead of just random parts here and there. Well, why didn't he?  He got me so confused that I gave up and didn't care less if I even saw the last minutes of it.  I did, though.  The film is a wild ride of turns and twists of events that turn out to be nothing more than disappointments.  The script itself is terrible.  The majority of the writing was silly and stupid, yet some of it was actually bearable.  It definitely needed work on. Well, would you look at that.  Lynch, as it just so happened, was also the writer of the film.  Surprise, surprise.  So, this movie managed to weasle a '1' out of me.  I'd have given it a -10 if I felt it would have made a difference.  But since there isn't a '0' or anything less than that, a '1' is what it gets.I've seen some pretty terrible films throughout the years, but 'Mulholland Dr.' definitely takes the prize home.  This dreadfully long movie drags on and on and manages to accomplish absolutely nothing.  The cast is okay, though it would have gone over better with a different set of actors.  The writing is horrible.  There are too many twists and turns set at every corner in order for anything really interesting to develope.  David Lynch is a joke and should be ashamed of himself for creating such an awful picture. The ending and basically the entire 145 minutes is confusing.  'Mulholland Dr.' is the worst film that I have ever seen. Avoid this one at all costs!",1,6,15,30 November 2002
"Girl, Interrupted"," A good film all around.
","I can't tell you how long I had waited to see 'Girl, Interrupted.'  When I finally got around to watching it, I was pleased with what I saw.  The acting is really good, the writing is fair, I guess, and the movie itself is just a fun film to watch.  I haven't had the chance to read Susanna Kaysen's book, but it is now next on my list. Winona Ryder, who is also an executive producer, is wonderful as Susanna Kaysen.  She works really well in the role and it of course wouldn't have been the same if another actress would have portrayed Kaysen.  Angelina Jolie is great.  I think that this is the first film of hers I have ever seen, and I would like to see her again in something else.  Her Golden Globe nomination (and win) was appropriate, but I don't know if her Oscar win was. Who cares, she was good!  Supporting cast members Clea Duvall, Elisabeth Moss, Brittany Murphy, Angela Bettis, and Jared Leto were all enjoyable. Vanessa Redgrave, Whoopi Goldberg, and Jeffrey Tambor were okay.The writing was pretty good.  I don't think that the film was emotional by any means.  I'm glad it wasn't.  The different situations revolving around each character were interesting.I would recommend 'Girl, Interrupted' to anyone.  It has its funny moments even though it is a drama.  The cast is entertaining.  And the score is fun. Watch it when you get a chance!",8,1,2,23 December 2002
Pretty Woman," It's okay but not as good as everyone claims it to be.
","I first saw 'Pretty Woman' a while back. I wasn't impressed with it the first time around, but when I caught a second viewing I was a little more interested. It's okay. Just okay.Julia Roberts and Richard Gere work really well together. I like this team of actors. Roberts is pretty good; entertaining, not annoying as she sometimes can be. Gere is a little lifeless at times, but I didn't have a problem with him for the most part. Hector Elizondo was, uh, sweet. Jason Alexander bugged me for quite some time. Laura San Giacomo was average.The plot's decent, the writing's a little dull, and the the film seems to be three hours long or so. It did get very slow after a while.
'Pretty Woman' is okay. It certainly isn't Roberts' best role or performance. It's something that I would watch twice and probably never again. That sort of thing.",Null,0,1,22 February 2003
Titanic," You either love it or you hate it.
","This movie is one of the most beautifully designed portrayals of a story that everybody has heard about. Titanic is the kind of movie where you either love it or you hate it. There's really no in between.I love this film. I definately don't hate it, and since it is close to being one of my most favorite films, I'll go all the way and say that I do indeed love it. With so many mixed comments about how it was so awful, or how it was the best film in the history of filmmaking, I just have to comment on it.I am pretty confident in saying that everybody has seen this. Most people complain about how it had such a big budget and that the sinking part of the movie was so unreal. Others say that the cast was made up of the worst actors possible. Let me break my opinions down into different sections of the movie. I thought that the cast did a very well job. When the time that Titanic was at the theaters, there was so much hype about Leonardo DiCaprio. After a while, the publicity was a little too much and it started to become old news. I agree that his part as Jack Dawson was an excellent role. Watching him for three hours + isn't too bad either. Kate Winslet gave a good breakthrough performance as Rose and I liked her style as to how she made the character come alive. The only problem that I had with her was that towards the end where it was focused just on her, she became a real snooty b _ _ _ _. That's okay, I guess that it was good for her to act in that certain mood. The entire cast, and I mean every last person, did an absolutely spectacular job. Frances Fisher, Kathy Bates, Billy Zane, Bill Paxton, Gloria Stuart, Bernard Hill, Victor Garber, and everyone else that was involved were really good. The writing was terrific. A lot of time and thought went into this script. After hearing that it was over three hours long, I had no intention on seeing it. But I went and saw it and was especially impressed with the writing that James Cameron put into it. Being that it is such a long movie, the script had to hold up well for the entire time. Not once did I think that it was boring or did I ever want to skip a part. That is one of the problems with most newer movies. Too many unnecessary parts are added in to take up time. Titanic was fine with everything pertaining to the script.The plot was a little original but still held my attention. A first class girl falling for a steerage boy and vice versa. Each scene and situation that the two were in really made it enjoyable. Both actors played these parts good and made it somewhat believable that they were star-crossed lovers. One problem that I had with the plot was that the meeting and getting to know each other was a little on the hurried side. They meet, fall in love, etc. We know the story. Maybe the special effects were the majority of the movie considering that the second half deals with the sinking of the ship. A lot of computers and a ton of money helped make the film a success. I'm not one for movies where special effects take over the entire film but there were enough in Titanic to where it still stayed realistic. Plus they were really good.
A big part of the film that I liked was the music and score for it. After a couple of songs, they all started to sound somewhat similar, but I was still able to get along with it. Just a little word on what I think the most annoying scene was. It was...the famous 'I'm the king of the world' line. It wasn't awful, but it was a minor part that could have been left out. I know that I'm forgetting something and as soon as I submit this, I'm going to remember it. Anyway, my final words are that this was a over-hyped, not overrated film that is still good to watch every now and again. I think that it was a little bad that Cameron and his crew set aside as much money as they did, just for one film. I am glad that the gained all of it back plus more. A little long, maybe ease up on the FX, and...that's about it. It was a very good movie. However, to get some ORIGINAL lines and writing, be sure to see A Night to Remember, and when it's available, see Titanic: The CBS Miniseries.",Null,0,2,13 December 2000
It's a Wonderful Life," I've always hated it, and I always will.
","I realize that there is approximately four other people on the planet who think like I do and can agree that this film is terrible.  Everybody loves it for some reason, but I have absolutely hated it ever since I watched it for the first time.'It's a Wonderful Life' is so boring.  Now I've sat through some pretty dull films before, but this is unheard of.  The thing is, I can usually get into the older movies.  I just can't get into this one.  I first saw this film a couple of years ago in school, and have unfortunately, been forced to watch it a few more times just because everybody in the entire world thinks that it is wonderful.  I wouldn't normally comment on a film that is so bad, but being that it IS bad and entirely overrated, I am forced to voice my opinion.The cast is terrible.  I've never seen James Stewart in anything else and I don't plan to.  He starts off good, everything's fine, but as time progresses, he becomes so annoying that I want to jump up and turn the TV off.  What can I say about Donna Reed except that she is a horrible actress who manages to contribute very little to this horrible picture.  Well, that's about it for the cast, I suppose.  Minor role players such as Lionel Barrymore, Thomas Mitchell, and Henry Travers are equally unimpressive.The writing and the script itself are mind-numbingly stupid.  'It's a Wonderful Life' is supposedly the tale of a depressed man who gets the chance to see what life would have been like if he had never been born. Okay, so how long exactly is it supposed to take to get to the damn point? The movie drags on and on and finally after about four hours (it seemed like that long to me), George Bailey meets Clarence, his angel, and is whisked away to the life where he doesn't exist.  So, basically the film tries to make a point and, I guess, finally does.  There's a couple of people out there who think that 'It's a Wonderful Life' is NOT a Christmas movie.  Well, they're right.  Why is everyone under the impression that this movie is a Christmas movie?  It's clearly not.'It's a Wonderful Life', a terrible movie if there ever was one, currently appears on the Top 250 list.  It's also managed to jump onto just about everyone else's favorites list, but I don't know how.  Its nominations for Best Picture, Best Actor, and Best Director, among others, is unbelievable and ridiculous.  The film is boring, slow-paced, and has no point to it for about the whole 130 minutes.  Frank Capra and this movie are overrated and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.  Avoid at all cause.",1,42,115,26 December 2002
A Beautiful Mind," It's good, but not worthy of Best Picture.
","'A Beautiful Mind' IS a good movie.  The acting is quite good, the story itself is ho-hum, but it just doesn't have what it takes to be a Best Picture.I have to admit that I was pretty impressed with Russell Crowe's performance.  I might just have to go all the way and say that I wouldn't have been upset if he would have won that Oscar.  He did a terrific job; he let his emotions flow, didn't seem to annoy me...no complaints here.  Okay, I have a complaint.  I did not agree with the casting of Jennifer Connelly. Am I truly the only one that thought that her role was extremely small?  I mean she just didn't have that big of a part.  She won her Oscar for some reason, not really sure why.  Ed Harris was alright.  He wasn't anything spectacular, but he certainly was better than Connelly.  I can't really remember any of the other actors just because they were all males, plus they looked somewhat similar to each other.  I'm not too thrilled with the story itself.  I had never even heard of John Nash before.  It seemed interesting, but then boring after a while, then it picked up, but became tiresome again.  It was a bit long, so I was somewhat relieved when it finally did come to an end. Okay, 'A Beautiful Mind' is good, but it did not deserve to be named Best Picture of the year.  I'm not sure that I would have even thought to put it in the nomination category.  The thing is is that Ron Howard did a wonderful job.  I'm a big fan of Howard; loved him for years.  He's an amazing director and his direction of the film is handled so well, but for some reason the movie just did not deserve that award.  He, however, did deserve his long awaited Oscar as it was rightfully awarded.  That didn't really make sense what I just said, but the main point that I'm trying to get across is that Howard did a great job.'A Beautiful Mind' is a good film to watch if you have the time and patience for a pretty slow paced movie.  Normally that would bug me to no end, but it's not as bad here.  It does lag though, at times.  It may have been nominated for a load of awards (winning half), but was still in need of that extra touch to really make it shine.",6,0,3,21 February 2003
Psycho," This is what good movies are all about.
","This is one of the best movies ever created and Alfred Hitchcock is one of the most intriguing film makers ever to live. (in my opinion) There's just so much to say about this film I hardly know where to start.I first saw this movie about five years ago and wasn't impressed at all. Of course, I was about ten years old at the time. I didn't think that the famous shower scene was anything to frightening and the characters seemed a little boring. A little less than a year ago, I became very interested in the history of the film and not so much of the film itself. I read articles, reviews, anything that I could get my hands on. Then, Psycho was shown on AMC and I immediately thought that it was a masterpiece. Shame on me for not appreciating it sooner.The film as a whole is spectacular, but I like to break it down into little sections. First, I was very surprised and impressed with the actors that played Marion Crane and Norman Bates. Janet Leigh isn't given to much exposure to the film since she is killed off in about the middle of it. I thought that she did a good but not great job. On the other hand, Anthony Perkins blew me away. Both Norman and Anthony are very interesting. Norman's life that is set up and shown to us is so well depicted that I can't imagine anybody else playing the part. All of the characters including Arbogast, Lila, and Sam are so well created. Obviously, the plot is so unique and odd that you can't help but smile at it. A young woman on the run after stealing $40,000, and then accidentally falls into the wrong hands of a psychopath. It's great! The best thing is that nobody has ever done anything quite like it, and they won't be able to because then the magic will be gone. Even though the ever so famous shower scene is said to be one of the most chilling death scenes in history, I think that it may be a little overrated. I love it as much as the next person, but it's not all that scary. Who said it was supposed to be scary? Nobody, I know. But the majority of the Psycho audience gathers it to be very frightening. I do still think that it is one of the greatest and shocking scenes ever. The setting is very well set up as well. The Bates motel and house is so cleverly created that it brings a special atmosphere to the audience. It has something about it that you just can't forget.Finally, that music played throughout the film is one of the most spookiest sounds I have ever heard. Great job to the music composers and to Hitchcock for this scary addition to the movie. I think it's safe to say that everybody has heard of Psycho, but not everyone has seen it. For those of you who still haven't seen this amazing flick, go see it! It's a must see.",10,12,20,25 November 2000
Scream 2," The bads will outweigh the goods.
","Scream 2 is a must-see in order to survive a trilogy. Since a trilogy was thought of after the first one came out, obviously they had to come up with a sequel. If you want to follow the entire Scream story, than see this. If you would like to enjoy the first one as it is and not even bother with two more, than don't waste your time. Scream 2 is almost as entertaining to watch as the first one. During the first ten minutes or so, two people are murdered. What will follow? Everybody's reaction is to think that there's going to be tons of different and exciting killing scenes to occur throughout the film. Wrong. I'm not one for watching detailed slaughter shots. They don't bother me and I won't deliberately turn away, but what's the point of having all of the characters die when there is not a strong reason to back it up.The variety of stabbings will keep the slasher film fans content. However, it's pretty easy to predict who is going to die next. It comes to the point where whenever you see a new character introduced, your first thought is 'oh, they're going to die too.'One of the problems with this film is that there are too many actors involved. The survivors from Scream return and are now working with Derek, Cotton, Mickey, Debbie, etc. Another problem is that a lot of the actors are given a part just so that their character can die, but serve absolutely no purpose to the plot. CiCi, Hallie, Phil, and Maureen will fall under this category. ~*spoiler~*The writing is all right if you're not looking for anything too complicated. Scream revealed that Billy was the killer because Maureen was having an affair with his father. That story works out okay. Scream 3 pulled all the loose ends together and explained everything during the first two movies. This movie has nothing to go off of. When I found out that the killers were who they actually were, I was very disappointed. I can partly accept the fact that Billy's mother returns, but I cannot understand why Mickey was involve. Apparently they needed two killers in order to follow in the steps of the first film, but this just doesn't work. Mickey's character isn't even given that much exposure before it is revealed that he is one of the killers. Neither is Debbie's character. A few lines here and there to Gale, and that was it. If you're going to present a horror movie to us, than give us a good ending to wrap it up with.The only thing more annoying than Neve Campbell still sitting high on the 'scream queen' thrown, is the way that the killers were indestructible. Throughout the years, having killers that just won't die have become very popular and very unrealistic at the same time. The fact that we had to wait until the end to find out who they really were was one explanation as to why they couldn't die. My opinion is that the crew ruins a movie by doing everything necessary to kill off the murderers, but it is impossible for them to actually die until it is at the end and in a convenient situation.
I'll say it again. This movie will please any Scream fan, but it wasn't a must to make. The story could have been left as a sequel with this one cut out, the third installment moved into the second place and the first one left as it was. A little confusing but I'm sure that with a few minor changes given to Scream 3, everything would have worked out okay.",Null,0,0,9 December 2000
Bring It On," So dumb it's actually kind of cute.
","'Bring it On' doesn't involve smart, intelligent writing. Hopefully we can all see that. This film has it's moments. Some are cute, some are dumb but overall it's a movie to just kick back and relax with.They don't make too many cheerleading movies and this is probably the reason why. The plot is cute and the cheers are funny but the acting was really terrible (on Shipman's part). I like Kirsten Dunst and for the most part, her choice in roles are good. But she should not have agreed to do this one. While the film makes her out to be 'airy', she never quite pulls it off. I can picture her as a cheerleader but she doesn't seem to fit in with the other actors. Oh, and with the little dramatic scenes that they threw in, Dunst handled them...not good. Toro's Torrance's rival, Isis played by Gabrielle Union was (I hate to admit it) but better than Dunst. The Clovers' cockiness was irritating but hey, Union was good. Her character isn't too likable but I think that the casting department was smart in casting Union in one of the leads. Eliza Dushku was good in this film. Another smart casting move. Who else? Jesse Bradford, I have to admit, wasn't all that great. It's kind of hard to comment on each actor because they all had somewhat small parts to make one big part as a cheerleading squad (plus some other characters). Even though he didn't have a big part, probably one of the smallest, I must say that I liked Les. All of the cheerleaders who made up the squad (particularly of the Toros) were all quite good.
I have to hand it to the writers and everyone responsible for making up the cheers because they actually were funny. The opening sequence was cute and I just couldn't get those cheers out of my head even after the movie was over. Bravo if I have to give it to something.The movie tries to show a typical picture of what cheerleaders are like and the crew did a pretty good job. 'Bring it On' isn't anything spectacular but it isn't terrible. Kirsten, you let me down on this one. Dunst fans should avoid this but if you just want to catch a teen flick that will keep you entertained for an hour and a half, bring this movie on!",Null,0,0,8 August 2001
Scream," It's not exactly a scream.
","Scream is a pretty general teen flick, that has some thinking put into it but not a whole lot. I don't care if this movie is a bit scary or isn't at all. (Along with most people, I agree that this wasn't at all frightening.) Instead of wanting to be scared out of my seat, I examine the different parts of the film, and specifically the plot and/or script.This film is quite entertaining and since I can manage through it more than five times, it must be okay. The plot and story that is created is clever but sort of a let down. When we find out who the killers are and what their motives were for going on a killing spree, it kind of leaves you with a thought of 'that's it?' The idea works but if it would have been changed, it might have worked better.The characters and actors involved are good and fit the roles very nicely. Being not much of a Neve Campbell fan, I think that this is one of the areas they could have made a lot of improvements on. This is strictly my opinion, so just skip ahead if you don't care. Campbell does not strike me as the 'scream queen' type, but obviously the casting department disagrees. Having to watch her act like she can...act, for almost two hours is torture. If they would have gotten anybody else to play the role of Sydney, I might have enjoyed the movie more. David Arquette, Courteney Cox Arquette, Matthew Lillard, Skeet Ulrich, and everybody else gives good performances.
The writing is a little cheapo and bland, but it still pulls it off. It lacks creativity, but does have some humorous moments. (Which was a must.) A few, well, a lot of lines were poorly written and maybe they could have used some different writers. Considering that this is a slasher/horror film, I'm not looking for some intelligent and greatly worded lines. But at least try to put some thinking into it. This doesn't fall under the writing category but I want to point this out. Another problem and something that I found very irritating was the numerous amount of goofs,bloopers, blunders, call it what you will. Simple and huge things were ruined and that just shows that a couple of people weren't doing their job. So, I can watch Scream now and again, but this is far from a well organized film. If anybody wants to see a simple and easy-to-follow movie, this one is for you.",Null,0,0,15 December 2000
Halloween," Happy Halloween!
","Halloween is the kind of movie where I can sit back, watch it, and NOT be relaxed. This is one of the few movies that actually scares me. It's not terrifying, but hey, with a movie that has the eerie music like this one does, it's bound to bring a couple of goose bumps.The good thing about Halloween is that it dates back a few years. Now days the horror movies involve all of the blood and gore. Twenty-two years ago or so, the movies weren't as detailed to murder scenes as they are now. And that is a good thing. Sure, this movie has stabbings and killings, but not the kind where they are so ridiculous.Jamie Lee Curtis does an excellent job as Laurie Strode. As a newcomer to the industry at that time, she sure does show that she is capable of being crowned a 'scream queen.' The rest of the cast performs well but Curtis really stands out. The story that is being told is very creative and interesting. Of course, we don't find out why the killer is after Laurie until the sequel, but the one that started the endless series of Halloween's is great none the less. The mysterious (although we know who he is) killer who keeps lurking around, creates a very scary atmosphere. It may be a little dull to some, and that's fine, but I really like it because we DON'T find out why the killer is going on a spree. (Once again until the second film.) The best thing about Halloween is that it is a very simple movie with a low budget. No expensive explosions or car wrecks were necessary to give this film a little bit of an edge. At certain parts, it couldn't of hurt to added some...exciting parts, but this film is pretty much good the way it is. The one thing that I would change is that the scenes are a little long and drawn out. The movie couldn't have been cut anymore since it is 90 minutes to begin with, but some scenes could have been shortened, and it might have held some more people's interest. One more thing that became semi-annoying was the music. As much as I like the scary music, after hearing it for almost the entire time of the film, it became just a little too much.
Halloween is a must see on Halloween. Forget the modern day horror flicks that try to capture originality and chilling scenes with their computerized effects. Instead, see one of the movies that actually lives up to the horror title.",Null,0,0,16 December 2000
Carrie," Not so much a horror but I'd watch it again.
","As an early teen horror film, 'Carrie' has a combination of a good cast, and plot. I love the plot! The writing and shooting is too drawn out, and yes, it is a very slow moving picture. Not exactly a '10' but I would be content with viewing it again.Sissy Spacek is perfect for the role of Carrie White. She really does seem like the lonely and picked-on high school girl that she portrays. Also, the fits being thrown with her mother are pretty good. Spacek is the sad looking girl who you can't help but feel sorry for. And in the second half, she suddenly transforms into the prom queen. Pretty unrealistic but still entertaining. The other character that I really enjoyed was Margaret White. Not only was she very psychotic, but she played the role so well. Carrie's classmates like Norma, Chris, and Sue were good supporting actresses. I especially liked the story line for Sue and how she talked her boyfiend into taking Carrie to the prom. The character of Tommy Ross played by William Katt was nice. Katt did a fairly good job as the school cutie who surprises everybody by agreeing to take the quiet little White to the dance of the year.*~Spoiler pertaining to the ending.*~The plot (a girl being picked on) isn't original but the famous pig's blood is. The telekinetic story line going for Carrie is well designed. As the blood scene is very famous, it wasn't all that great. Original but not too exciting. Not much else to say about the movie except that the ending was a huge disappointment. I didn't like how they had Spacek's character die and how it was written so that her mother stabbed her. The prom fire was well designed but again, I didn't care for how everybody died (except Sue) including Miss Collins. The worst part was Sue's dream and how the movie ends with her screaming in terror. It was a let down.While this movie was good for its time, it can slowly be pushed aside. Definitely not scary but still entertaining to watch just how far somebody will go to get revenge.",Null,0,0,23 January 2001
Vanilla Sky," This is the second worst film I have ever seen.
","'Vanilla Sky' is awful.  It is the second worst film that I have ever had the misfortune of viewing.  'Mulholland Dr.' is the absolute worst, but I don't know, it comes pretty close.It is so weird how I dislike this film, yet I love Cameron Crowe's previous film, 'Almost Famous' so much.  'Almost Famous' is one of my favorite films of all time.  So, what was Crowe's problem here?  I have no idea, but his direction of this project is so bad that it's a wonder if he finds work after this.  Tom Cruise, what were you thinking?  Oh, I just adore Cruise, but it really hurts that he would go out and pick this dud when he could have had the pick of ANY film in the world.  I think that he is a terrific actor, and his looks don't hurt, of course, but his acting was so....dull in 'Vanilla Sky.' For some unknown reason, he managed to get well over $20 million here, but for what exactly?  Cameron Diaz was just okay.  I don't understand how she got the kind of (rave) reviews she got.  How did she get a Golden Globe nomination?  Everyone acts as if she was the main character in this film, when really she didn't even have that big of a part.  Seriously, her performance was overrated, overrated, overrated!  Penélope Cruz.  What can I say except that she is the worst actress ever.  Well, I suppose if you're out to capture a terrible movie, you better go out and hire the worst actress in the industry.  Not only is she hard to understand her with the darn accent and all, but....she can't act!  It's as plain and simple as that.  She acts as if she's the best thing in the picture.  I hate to use this saying because even I hate it, but she couldn't act her way out of a paper bag.  Oh, I like Jason Lee.  It's a shame that he had such a small part.  Kurt Russell must have been in dire need of work when he signed on to do this film.  This cast is one of the most terrible ones that I have ever seen.  Again, why'd you do it Tom!?This plot is so out there.  It is way too out there.  The film was all fine and everything up until the car accident.  After that, it was complete chaos and confusion.  'Vanilla Sky' continued on and it seemed okay, I suppose, but then when the whole thing is explained and 'cleared up', it just gets messed up again (if that makes any sense).  The writing was BORING!  I couldn't even follow half of the script mainly because I didn't want to.  The whole film just seemed so pointless. 
There were two things in this film that I actually did like.  One, Jason Lee manages to show up.  I loved him in 'Almost Famous' and it was a pleasure to see him again, no matter how minor his role was.  Two, I really liked the famous Times Square scene.  It was different and very cool.  Come on, what other film could have pulled that stunt off?There's nothing worse than a movie that ends too quickly, leaving a lot to the imagination.  And that's exactly what 'Vanilla Sky' did.  It ended at the drop of a hat and I was actually left staring at the TV screen wondering if something else would pop back up.  You know, to clarify some things. Yeah, it didn't.So, the script was meant to...well, I don't really know what it was meant to do.  Maybe its goal was to help people get a good night's rest.  I don't know!  Tom Cruise is a good actor but fails to deliver an even half decent performance.  Two other good things slip onto the screen, but Penélope Cruz and that retarded mask that Cruise wears for most of the film, manage to completely ruin the film all together.  'Vanilla Sky' gets a big old '1' out of me.  I wouldn't recommend this one to anyone.",1,0,2,30 November 2002
Signs," Oh, how previews are so very, very deceiving.
","Where do I begin?  I sat down to watch 'Signs' just the other night.  I had been wanting to see it ever since it was still playing at the theaters.  My aunt rented it and the only thing that came out of my mouth, along with a few swear words here and there, was how I was so glad that I didn't waste my hard-earned money on such garbage.  This is the kind of film that gets everyone's attention when those clever but sneaky advertising jerks decide to air the trailer picking out the ONLY half interesting scenes in the entire film.  Man, I hate when they do that. However, I would do it too if I were in their position.  Why wouldn't I? Anyway, the previews looked really good; little did I know that they were extremely deceiving, and the film managed to stay at the top of the box office list for a while, so I figured that it couldn't be all bad.  Don't believe it!Aside from the terrible acting, lack of excitement, scares and intelligence, it moved at a pace that would irritate anybody, or so I thought, but being that a lot of people did like it for some reason, who knows anymore. 'Signs' also lacks...what's that thing called?  Oh, yeah, dialogue.  Was it just me or did it seem like there was absolutely no talking in this picture? It was all show, actions, and not enough speaking.  It reminded me of 'Cast Away' in that sense, and I don't even want to get into that disaster.  So, moving along. The acting shown here is pathetic.  I know that everyone likes Mel Gibson and the guy earns up to $25 million a pic, but honestly, for what?  He looked out of it for the most part; what is Shyamalan really doing behind those cameras?  He didn't react to anything like he should have, his very few speaking parts were boring, drawn out, and a lot of them really had nothing to do with the plot itself.  Those really long monologues were unbearable. Joaquin Phoenix was just a tad better than Gibson, but still had nothing to show for it.  Another Culkin pops onto the screen and I have to say, he was probably the best actor in this film.  Most people found the young Abigail Breslin to be impressive while I found her to be purely annoying.  Oh, and the biggest laugh of all, you guessed it, the man behind this terrible project, M. Night Shyamalan, works his way onto the screen. That's right, he's not only the writer, director and producer, he's also an actor.  Who are you kidding, M?  It really bugs me to no end when those hot shot directors and all happen to make a cameo in their films just because they're their films and they can do whatever they please.I can at least see where this plot would have been a good idea, but it gets ruined.  The ending was a big mistake.  For some reason, I thought that it would pick up just a bit toward the end, but it didn't.  It was a huge disappointment as was the entire film as I have pointed out.  The script, the actual writing was so boring.  I found 'Signs' to move at a slow pace, yet it seemed to me that just as I had slipped the tape into my VCR, it wasn't only but a half hour or so after that I was finishing up the film.  I guess I should be thankful for that.I would not recommend 'Signs' to anyone, and I mean anyone.  The writing, the acting, the directing, the beginning, middle and end were all poorly projected.  Shyamalan managed to rake in the bucks (and the rave reviews) yet again, though I don't understand how.  Between 'The Sixth Sense' and this trash, it's a wonder this guy can find people to back him up whenever he comes up with a new idea.  'Signs' is a horrible film that only seemed good due to its misleading previews.I would have avoided this film all together, but it's not like they warned me it would be as bad as it was.",2,2,3,17 January 2003
The Sixth Sense," I see an interesting plot with a very poor script.
","Why? Why? Please tell me why people enjoy long, boring movies that must have a high budget in order for it to be good. Also, I've noticed that all of the films with the 'hottest' celebrities in it, are garbage. The Sixth Sense is proof. I waited until the movie came out on video to see it, so that I could try to understand the movie at my own pace. The nonstop showing of the 'I see dead people' trailer forced me to watch it. I waited and waited for that part in the movie where Haley Joel Osment's character finally confesses that he in fact, does see dead people. The part came and went and I was left sitting there thinking, 'that was what all of the hype was about?'
This film could have been a success (in my opinion) if they would have rewritten most of the movie and eliminated Bruce Willis's character. One of the reasons this film was so popular was because the part of Malcolm Crowe was played by the always talented and big-named Bruce Willis. His part in the making of this was about as useless as the huge budget it had. (I'll talk about that later.) Whenever a movie is released with a big time actor, it's safe to say that the movie will become a hit. Haley Joel Osment was terrific, so why not pair him up with a lesser-known actor. Don't get me wrong, Willis is truly talented, but anybody could have played that role and it wouldn't have made a difference. The characters and actors were good with the exception of....Bruce. Osment shined in his role as Cole Sear. His talent was the only good think about this film. I was very impressed with him, and I think that it would have been hard to find any other young boy to play that part the way he did. For the role he was given, Willis did a fine job as usual. Not a lot of effort was put into it though. A little more could have come from the psychologist's part.Lets talk about the budget. Considering that it was $55 million plus, I would have liked to have seen a little more effects. Nothing ruins a movie more than an overload of special effects. Worse, when they're not even necessary. This movie didn't even come close to having enough. I'm trying to think where exactly in the movie were these heavy duty illusions, and I can't remember. Anyway, that amount of money put into a movie where it could've just as easily been made without any ghostly effects, was a ridiculous waste of money.The plot and intentions of this film were good, but it was down right boring. I was on the verge of falling asleep, but I was so anxious to find out what happened at the end, so I forced myself to stay awake. I read the summary of the film, and it sounded really good. Maybe it was the long scenes that were stretched to the limit so that they could build the story up to the climax. Or, maybe it was the pointless and unnecessary writing that was included in this ludicrous script. Either way, I thought that it was one of the most overrated and silliest films I have ever seen. Once again, the movie might have had a chance if it cut down on the way too long scenes between Malcolm and Cole. ~*spoiler~*What am I leaving out? The ending! The ending was quite a shock, but it left a ton of questions unanswered. We discover that Malcolm is a ghost, but there are too many problems for this to be semi-realistic. It would have been a lot easier for Cole to realize that he's such a whiz with ghostly activities, and think just what if my friend, Mr. Crowe is also a ghost? A little far fetched and I'm getting off track, but the ending that should have been a major high point to the story, was ruined by its lack of creativity and was a total disappointment. Everybody loved this movie for reasons that are beyond me. From now on I think that I'm going to stick with low budget movies and simple plots. And that also have some interesting and exciting parts in it. 'I see dead people' was one of the dumbest lines ever created, but it was made into a masterpiece. I have no idea why.",Null,0,0,11 December 2000
Contact," It's hard to say whether or not I liked it.
","Here you have a three hour long movie that deals with the discovery of aliens, unknown life forms, perhaps god, and anything else that could come up in a discussion. 'Contact' is definitely one of the best films ever put together. Why? Well, it has intelligent writing which is just enough for me to consider it to be great. But there's more to it like the good acting, the budget and how they used it in a fairly enjoyable way, the idea to bring this discovery/project to the screen, and above all, the fact that this is the future or the present.I personally found this film to be a little hard to follow. Yes, it had extremely creative and intelligent writing, which is why I liked it. But it also brought up many questions, answers and a script that I just couldn't keep up with. Obviously nobody else seemed to have this problem. In my opinion, you need to be partly up to today's technology to just get a grip on the plot outline. I could follow it for the most part, but when Ellie took her trip at the end, I really lost interest mainly because it was too complex.Jodie Foster was terrific as usual. She really put everything she could into the role of Ellie Arroway. She was nominated for a Golden Globe but sadly lost. The film was nominated for an Academy for Best Sound but lost. Somebody please explain to me why she wasn't nominated for and Academy Award. This was a performance that certainly was worthy of this award but wasn't even considered as one of the nominees. That has got to be one of the most disappointing things because she truly did deserve it. Not to mention that the movie itself wasn't even nominated. I'll get back to the cast. Matthew McConaughey was partly a good choice for being casted as Palmer Joss. His effort put into this role was once again very good. There's one problem. McConaughey just doesn't seem like the character that he portrays. Foster could get away with it but this guy can't. His performance: good. Expecting me to believe that he was this highly intelligent scientist: get real. Tom Skerritt who plays David Drumlin was okay but nothing fantastic. A good choice for this role but it could have been handled by a number of other people. There were so many people in this film with important roles that I can't remember them. Well anyway, the entire cast was good. Playing a scientist isn't always easy. I'll hand it to the crew for creating such a huge cast. Have you taken a look at everyone that was involved in this movie? This was a good way to make the idea and the plot come alive.When we're dealing with a Sci-Fi movie, a big budget is bound to come up. Most movies have a tendency to make the special effects overcome the film by turning the majority of it in an animated form. 'Contact' did have a big budget and everything was going good. I was pleased that there were some effects but not too many. Then that image was ruined. When it neared the end of the film or whenever Ellie finally takes her space trip, the animation did become too much. Her 'psychedelic' trip into wherever she landed was enough for me. Even the part where the machine (pod) gets destroyed. But it was ruined when the Pensacola drawing became somewhat real. Once again, this movie turned out like all of the others. This is the future of movies but is there any reason why 1 film has to have such a large budget to please the audience? I've yet to read the book. Half of the people consider the book to be better while the other half believes that bringing the book to life was a better choice. All I can say is that it was good to see a movie that actually did take a lot of time to create and didn't look like something that was put together in a week. I think that when a movie is created based on a novel, it shows that people still take the time to get the facts straight. Although this movie did take a lot of research to get it done, I found that it also had quite a few errors. Any other movie, I would frown, but being that 'Contact' had a good plot to go off of, I'll let it slide.
While the budget had to cover the effects, it also covered a lot of changes of scenery. The machine itself, the control station or whatever the correct name for it is, the White House, the strip of satellites, and every other thing that was shown was greatly designed/set up. There is nothing better in a movie than seeing different shots of landmarks or anything. The worst is of course, viewing the same old set for the length of the movie.While I can say that I somewhat enjoyed the film, I did find some things that could be improved. 1) If this movie would have been shortened, it would have made it even better. I realize that a lot of time had to be taken up in order for the audience to get the real knowledge out of the point the crew was trying to make. And that this isn't the type of movie that can fit into an hour or two. But three!? 2) This film is definitely a serious film. Some basic or common knowledge about space could come in handy in order to follow it. It wouldn't hurt. But the writers, directors and everyone involved might have aimed a little too high.Did I like it or didn't I? I can't completely answer that for the reasons I have tried to explain. 'Contact' is an underrated film and Jodie Foster wasn't recognized enough for her performance. Worthy of a Best Picture nomination? Sure, why not. I've seen worse films nominated let alone win the award.",Null,1,2,4 February 2001
The Wedding Singer," Adam Sandler always impresses me.
","I think that this movie is very funny with a great cast full of mostly talented actors. I could just watch this movie over and over and over. Wait, I have done that. When I first heard of The Wedding Singer, I thought that it would never work. You have Adam Sandler a hilarious and truly talented actor paired up with Drew Barrymore, a very annoying and lack of...talent actress. As you can tell, I don't care for her that much. So I saw it and I just kept cracking up.The cast does work well together. I just wish that they could have casted somebody else besides Drew Barrymore. Adam Sandler does good musical performances, and is down right crazy. The two main parts of Julia and Robbie are very well written out. The parts of Sammy, Glenn, Linda, Holly, George etc. are very entertaining. For the part she is given, Drew plays it well and makes a very well love interest for Adam's character. The cast working as one is unusually hysterical.This film is good from start to finish. What does every hip and excellent film have to have? Nothing else but the wardrobe, music, and hair of the stylin' 80's. With little parts thrown in like at the dance club, and the hot-off-the-shelf CD player, this film depicts the era fairly okay, but not to the point where you're ready to hit Billy Idol over the head with Robbie's guitar. The Wedding Singer is simple as many people have pointed out earlier. Boy meets girl and all of that perfect love. This is a simple story like that, but with a few twists and turns, it turns out to be a real winner of a film.",Null,0,1,8 December 2000
The Wizard of Oz," I wish I could have followed the yellow brick road.
","I remember watching this movie when they would air it once a year on CBS a few years back. Now it is shown on a couple of different networks quite frequently. This is a wonderful film for the whole family. Who wouldn't want to take a journey to the magical land of Oz?I think that it is terrific how well this movie has held up over the years. It's going on sixty-two years since it was first released and yet, it is timeless. It is great to look back on a film that was made in the thirties, and compare it to the movies made in this day and age. This is a film that will just be something that stays around forever. The Wizard of Oz is enjoyable for people of all ages. Everything about it brings a smile to my face. Wouldn't it be wonderful to just magically be transported to a land of talking trees and little munchkins? Of course it would be. The flying monkeys, a talking lion, the astounding ruby slippers, and everything else adds a special kind of magic to the screen.The atmosphere and setting is magnificent. This is one of the things that makes the film so stunning. Anyway, the forest, the witch's castle, and even the farm is really well laid out.I don't think that the casting could have been done any better. Judy Garland shines as the innocent Kansas girl. Her dancing and singing just brightens the whole story up. The lion, tin man, and scarecrow perform amazingly also. Everyone involved down to the littlest munchkin acts so well.
Even though this is a movie for everyone, it is categorized as a children's flick. The writing is good with very simple lines and problems, but slightly complex so we're not falling asleep of boredom. What's left to say? Other things like the wardrobe, special effects, musical talents, and even the famous yellow brick road, are so well put together. Oz gives us an idea of what an almost perfect world would be like. No matter how old this movie becomes and we still look back on it, we'll still be able to enjoy at least one thoughtful movie. Classics never die. (Hence the name.)",Null,131,164,8 December 2000
High Fidelity," A film with about five laughs.
","Once again it just so happens that the movie that I think is terrible turns out to be a hit not only among other viewers, but with tons of critics as well.  'High Fidelity' is a boring film with very few laughs.I rented this film for one reason and one reason only:  John Cusack.  I haven't seen Cusack in too many films, but once I did manage to catch him in something, I was immediately interested in seeing him again. 
Cusack is good, very good, but unfortunately, he can't save this disaster. I was a little surprised to find out that he also co-produced and wrote for 'High Fidelity.'  Iben Hjejle is terrible and annoying.  I guess that's a little harsh, but I just didn't care for her one bit.  Todd Louiso and Jack Black are funny.  Black made me laugh a couple of times.  The cast itself was a disappointment, but Cusack is great by himself.I expected 'High Fidelity' to be quite funny, as the video box read that it should hit the top-five list (with a bullet).  I managed to laugh maybe five times, if that.  As I said, Black was somewhat funny, but I really only laughed once or so at Cusack's jokes.  Bottom line is that this movie is not to be rented if one is looking to actually laugh.So, the acting is pretty good, but the actors aren't that enjoyable except for John Cusack.  Laughs are very few and far between.  The writing is pretty dull in general.  Don't be fooled, I would definitely pass on this bomb.",3,0,2,23 December 2002
