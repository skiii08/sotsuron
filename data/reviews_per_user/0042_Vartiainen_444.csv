The Rock," Hard-packed action classic
","The Rock is generally considered to be one of the major Nicholas Cage films and one of the better Sean Connery films as well. And for a reason. It's a classic 90s action film from an era where the plot lines have started to become a little darker, but where the heroes still believe in human ideals and doing what's right.The Rock rises above its peers mainly because of its main actors. Both Cage and Connery are well-suited for their roles and their quirks and charisma hold the cheesy plot together. Not that I have anything against cheesy. On the contrary, I prefer my action movies to be at least slightly removed from brutal reality, and this movie is simply goldilocks.It also helps that the script is clever enough to keep us guessing until the very end. The basic premise, that of Alcatraz prison tourists held hostage, is enough to arouse our interest and from there the main players are introduced and allowed to work off each other. They're all distinct enough and memorable enough that you'll care what happens to them and you'll be pleasantly shocked when some of them do something unexpected. There are plenty of twists to keep you interested and the whole story does not have a lull moment in it, as it should be.That being said, the story as a whole is a bit clich√©d, even by 90s standards, and while some of the twists are surprising, the main story arc is rather predictable. I'd claim that it's a professional take on old story traditions, but some might argue that it could have been more original with some effort. Personally I don't mind all that much, but it's a theoretical flaw.The Rock is a treat for all fans of action. It's one of the more well-known action films for a reason and is sure to thrill all those that decide to give it a watch.",Null,2,3,14 April 2015
The King's Speech," Strangely underwhelming idea, executed with grace and power
","You wouldn't think that a movie about a man trying to overcome his stuttering problem would amount to much anything, but when you add in the fact that the man in question is King George VI of Britain and that the movie takes place just before and during the early stages of World War II, well, then you have a powerful drama in the making.Not that a movie about just a man with a speech impairment couldn't have been good, but the historical background does add to the movie's charm in this case, in my opinion. The fact that the king needs to be able to make speeches in order to lead his country raises stakes and makes the learning process more than just a personal struggle. The fact that this is based on a true story also adds that final touch of realism, which is clearly present in the film as a whole. The film feels like this really could have happened, and to a degree it did. Apparently the film makers did take some liberties with the timeline and the small details, but in this case all these changes were done for a reason and at least I don't blame them. This film is done with professionalism, care and personal love for the subject matter and it shows. Excellent film making all around.Nevertheless, the quality of a drama film is often decided by the main actors, and this is no exception. This film needed charismatic and, above all, convincing actors to play King George and Lionel Logue. Fortunately Colin Firth and Geoffrey Rush more than rose up to the occasion, giving brilliant performances and easily convincing us that they are the real deal. Firth especially was amazing, I cannot praise his performance enough. His soul, his struggling, his quiet dignity and determination.Props for Helena Bonham Carter as well. Always a favourite of mine.This is a film that all lovers of historical drama should see. The story is extremely powerful. It invests you into the lives of its characters and when things finally start to work out for our dear king, you cannot help but smile proudly.",Null,0,2,27 September 2012
The Mask," Jim Carrey is the man
","In The Mask a demonic visage gets released upon the world and ends up in the hands of Stanley Ipkiss, a frumpy bank clerk with something of a bone to pick with the world. It transforms him into a living cartoon character, with the power of violent slapstick on his side. And in a moment of perfect casting they got Jim Carrey to play this role.The idea is a fun one and Carrey is definitely enough of a rubber face to pull it off, even though the actual mask is mostly handled with CGI. It mostly captures the essence of Carrey, but I have to admit that something is lost in the translation. Carrey is very good when out of the mask, but I have to admit that part of his charm is the fact that he's so cartoon like in real life. When you make him an actual cartoon character, it loses something.I also have to admit that the humour is missing something here. I read that they had to scrub a lot of the visual gags for budget reasons, and it kind of shows. There are some good jokes here and there, but most of them are merely okay. The movie is at its best when it simply allows Carrey to sink into a comedy routine, but that's rarely the case.Still, if you're a Jim Carrey fan, the film is definitely worth a watch. Not one of his best, but there's enough here to please.",Null,1,1,9 August 2019
Saturday Night Fever," Much deeper and meaningful than you'd expect
","A film that played not an insignificant part in helping to launch the last big disco craze of the late 70s. Seen as something of a cultural icon for the music genre and regarded as a minor cult classic. Which is why I was surprised to find out that its outlook on disco was in fact rather jaded. It definitely showcases the style and the mood of the music genre beautifully, but it doesn't glorify the culture behind it. Quite the opposite in fact. It deals with subjects such as aimlessness of early adulthood, gang violence, lack of responsibility, the downsides of loose sexuality, the list goes on. It shows that the reason people become so obsessed with disco was because they had absolutely nothing else going for them, no other goal worth pursuing.So what's the story? Tony Manero (John Travolta) is a young Italian American living in Brooklyn. He has a job in small hardware store, which is going nowhere, even though his boss seems to like him. His parents idolize his older brother, a priest by profession, not placing many expectations on him. In his downtime he hangs out with a couple of his friends, who have essentially formed a gang, and goes to a local disco club, where he is regarded as the king of dance. Then he meets a woman, another great dancer like him, who causes him to start questioning his life and his goals.This is very much John Travolta's film. One of his earliest film roles and still one of his best. It's actually not that surprising that Sylvester Stallone liked this film a lot - enough to direct its sequel in fact - because you can definitely see a lot of similarities between it and his own Rocky. Both are brilliant examples of their respective main genres, dancing and boxing, respectively, but what makes both of them work beyond their genre limitations is the substance in them. They are good genre films, but they also provide you with great drama, social commentary and character development. Both feature uneducated, down on their luck blue collar protagonists, who nevertheless struggle to make something out of themselves and improve their lot in life.Saturday Night Fever is a great film. Not only because it's such an inviting, energetic and enjoyable film visually and auditorily, but because it's an excellent example on how to make a film be more than its bare bones. It is a film with both style and substance and is well worth a watch for all looking for a good story.",Null,2,2,13 December 2015
The Lobster," What does it mean?
","In The City you have to find a partner before you get too old. If you don't, you get sent to The Hotel, where you have only forty-five days to do so before you get turned into an animal. It is suggested to look for someone in The Hotel that you have at least something in common with. No matter how minor that something is. Do you both perhaps suffer from the same physical ailment? Perfect! More than enough ground to build a relationship upon. Right?The Lobster is very much an art film. The premise is highly symbolic, is not even meant to be logical and realistic, and plays on your emotions more than your common sense. And it is told in such a way that it's clear that there's something behind all the nonsense to get, if you know what I mean.I sure did not get whatever that something was, to be sure. The obvious parallels with societal pressure to find a partner, the fear of spinsterhood, the physiological urge to mate and so on, are of course blindingly obvious, but it's the add-ons that baffle me. Like the whole 'get turned into an animal' thing. Does the film try to claim that beyond certain age you cannot find a partner? Probably not, but then why such a final solution. If it was meant to convey that society believes you incapable of finding a partner beyond certain age, why not a death penalty?The whole film is very much like that. Clear goals and basic messages conveyed through muddled metaphors, odd symbolic language and a plot so stilted and woodenly acted that it had to be intentional, for whatever reason.Still, it is very professional on the technical level, the actors are trying their best and some of the metaphors are actually really spot on. Whenever the film tries to be a pure satire, it works really well. It's a shame that it seems to think itself above such a pedestrian art form.",Null,0,2,27 August 2018
The Avengers," Culmination of something awesome
","Back in mid-00s when Marvel announced their intentions for the Marvel Cinematic Universe, we quite honestly didn't believe they could pull it off. Five big budget blockbuster movies before a grande finale. Before that we had had trouble getting even two sequels, and even then they normally hadn't been all that great, with especially the third movie usually sucking something fierce.But they did it. Somehow they went and did it. And yeah, you could argue that they had the advantage of being allowed to switch characters and subjects around freely and that the only 'actual' sequel, Iron Man 2, was easily the weakest of the bunch, but still. This was a revolutionary movie, something we had never seen before. A phenomenon that changed film making.Furthermore, it's not only a great idea, it's also one of the best superhero films ever made, one of the best action popcorn films as well, and one of my personal favourites. And it's actually easy to see why. You've already established all of your characters, you've built them up and given them clear identities. You also have an amazing ensemble cast of actors, most of them having risen to the highest echelons of Hollywood. You have Joss 'God of Nerds' Whedon directing and writing. You've already created a need and want for this kind of movie, so you don't have to water it down. It can be an honest and direct superhero film, with quick wit, blazing action and phenomenal, state of the art special effects. No need to sell it to the big audiences by cramming it needlessly full of everything else. You can keep it pure.And it works so well. It's a fast-paced movie, with every scene full of excitement, jokes and entertainment, but Whedon knows what he's doing. There's pacing, there are lulls in between the action, allowing you to re-acquaintance yourself with these characters and their individual story lines, all of which meet and intertwine in this colossus of a movie.The Avengers is pure entertainment. It's only smart in a quick-witted street punk manner, so it's certainly not going to win over the worst of the high brow community, but what it has in spades is charm, entertainment value and pure, high-tuned, perfected action. Amazing movie.",Null,2,6,5 July 2015
Blade Runner 2049," Manages to live up to its predecessor surprisingly well
","The original Blade Runner film by Ridley Scott is a thoughtful, philosophical science fiction masterpiece. It's a neo-noir detective story set in a dystopian future and has since its release influenced entire generations of film makers and other creators. So if you're going to direct a sequel over three decades later, you better make it work.And getting a guy like Denis Villeneuve to direct certainly helps. At least on a purely visual level. Well get into the story in a little bit, but let's first talk about the visuals, the sound, the whole feel of the film. Because all that is fantastic! It's so easy nowadays to say that the film looks good, but this goes beyond that. The original Blade Runner had a very unique look back on its day, which would then influence all the scifi films to come after it. Yet it always remained kind of its own thing. But this film finally captures the essence of that world where rain always falls and people live low, miserable lives amidst giant, towering monoliths of technology and science. Everything from grand, sweeping shots of the city to the haunting, electric howls of the sound track to the grime and yellow filth clinging to every surface. Eleven points out of ten for pure style.As for the story, it's good. And that's unfortunately the best I can say about it. I've always found Villeneuve to be a better visualist than a storyteller and that holds true here as well. The themes and the characters have that Blade Runner feel to them, which is why I can call it at least good, but the story is not terribly deep or philosophical, nor is it surprising. The film makers actually specifically asked for the early critics not to reveal any plot points, and for the life of me I can't see why. It is a predictable movie. There is one fairly good twist near the end, but that's it. And even that you could kind of guess based on common storytelling tropes.Still, I'm glad this movie exists. The look and feel of it alone is easily worth the price of admission and the story, while not amazing, will scratch that urge you have built over the decades.",Null,2,9,31 October 2017
Million Dollar Arm," Nondescript, no other major faults
","A struggling sports agent is at the end of his rope, which forces him to get creative and try a gamble no one has ever tried before. He figures that he needs a new and upcoming baseball star pronto, but where would one find one. Then he figures that India as a country is a huge untapped market and surely he can travel there, hold auctions and find someone who's able to pitch a mean ball.And from thereon out it's the tried, true and patented Disney sports film formula played to death in front of your eyes. You know exactly how the story is going to go from minute one. Sure, it's not a kid's film per se, so the main character is allowed to be a bit of a jerk and there can be scenes where people are not covered from head to toe in conservative clothing, but it's still squeaky clean and safe. And I have nothing against the Disney formula, but it still means that the film is very much paint by numbers.That being said, the film is based on true events, which gives it a bit more oomph. India as a country is given a fair treatment, the two Indian baseball players given a chance to break into the American leagues are a lot of fun, the main character is likable despite or perhaps because of his jerkiness.Would I recommend the movie to anyone? Perhaps if I knew they were a die-hard baseball fan... Other than that, probably not, I have to admit.",Null,0,0,9 March 2017
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," Why is this in two parts?
","The Hunger Games story continues with the third installation, Mockingjay. And it's about as padded and needlessly long as every other two-parter we've had since the studio executives came up with this money-grabbing monstrosity of an idea.Not to say you shouldn't see this one if you've liked the previous Hunger Games films. This continues the story just fine. Jennifer Lawrence still shines as Katniss Everdeen. Her presence and talent hold us through even through scenes you instantly recognize as needless padding and waste of our money. The returning cast is also as talented as they've always been and most of the new characters are also casted without hitches. Julianne Moore is perhaps a bit too... Julianne Moore to play President Coin 100 percent convincingly, but she has certain presence as well, that cannot be denied.What bugs me is the story. The book itself was the weakest of the trilogy, though not by much, and it seems that its faults bleed into the film. Especially because the iron tight pace of the previous installations is thrown straight out of the window and we spent most of our time building up atmosphere. And building. And building. And... You get the point. There's very little bang for your buck here and even when something substantial happens, it simply lacks that edge.Plus, they had the perfect closing scene, and for some reason they decided to keep going for about five minutes. Trust me, you know where they should have ended it when you've seen the movie.This is a good movie. It still looks great, the main actors are brilliant and it has enough depth to impress through its story alone. I just wish they had had the integrity to go with one movie. It very well might have been the best Hunger Games movie of the three. It would have had two movies before it to build up momentum and steam. Instead it lifts up the pedal from the gas and decides to stroll over the finish line. Poor form, extremely poor form.",Null,35,39,31 January 2015
Vertigo," Intense study of compulsions, deception and lust
","Vertigo was not a massive hit upon its release, but it has since become a cornerstone movie, one of the most beloved movies of its director, Alfred Hitchcock, and is nowadays regarded as one of the best movies of all time, especially by critics.And it certainly is a masterful film, even by Hitchcock's standards. It's also a very complex movie, even for him. Like in Psycho, the midway point of the film turns the whole arrangement on its head, and from thereon out it's almost like a completely new film. It's not anything I've ever seen before and quite frankly it left me feeling conflicted. On one hand the sudden reveal is such an unconventional way to tell a story that I appreciate it for its novelty and uniqueness. On the other hand I cannot help but think whether the twist would have had more impact if it had been revealed in a more traditional way.This dilemma also plagued Hitchcock himself, who reportedly wanted to change the twist into a more traditional form, but the producers told him to keep it. And in the end I'm glad they did, because it is such a novelty.Aside from that the film has its usual assortment of Hitchcock goodies. Master-level technique, powerhouse actors, intense atmosphere, great music, engaging storytelling. The whole nine yards and the kitchen sink to boot.Hitchcock's best film? Personally I'd say Psycho is just a bit better, but this is surely in the upper echelons. Well worth a watch.",Null,3,3,14 November 2018
Men in Black 3," Somewhere between the second and the first in terms of quality
","I was cautiously optimistic when I heard that they were going to make another MIB movie. The first movie was extremely good in my opinion and even the lackluster sequel had some good things in it. Plus, it's hard not to like Will Smith in pretty much anything. The man is the definition of likable. Add in the chance to see young Agent K, some jokes about the late 60s and more of those comically weird aliens - it all seemed promising.And the movie delivered beautifully. I got pretty much what I expected. It wasn't as good as the first one, which had the novelty on its side and could really work all the good jokes in, but it was definitely better than the sequel. The stupid jokes had been dropped, the dog was thankfully kept out and as a whole the tone was kept closer to the original. It's still lighthearted and family-friendly, but it didn't treat its audience like we were mentally handicapped idiots.And at the same time all the good things were kept in and focused upon. Will Smith's Agent J was still as good as ever, yet he had been given the opportunity to develop as a character. He's a senior agent now and thankfully the movie realized this. Agent K was good as well, and his younger counterpart was played brilliantly by Josh Brolin. Very good role performance in my opinion, he absolutely nailed the character.Plus, the supporting characters were very strong, the villain, while nothing special, still welt like a genuine threat and had character, the imagery didn't disappoint and the tired time travel plot avoided the most obvious pit falls.Still, I must admit that the plot was probably the biggest fault in this movie. Nothing was obviously wrong with it, but nothing in it was all that special either. It's your run-down-the-mill time travel plot to stop the bad guy, who has gone back in time to change things. If you're seen one of them, you've seen this movie. The movie manages to keep its viewers from getting bored by focusing on the characters and the somewhat dark, yet goofy atmosphere, but one could still see that the writers hadn't had any new ideas.Final thoughts: If you liked the previous MIB movies or even just the first one, this one is definitely worth checking out. It's a decent action/adventure film and well worth your time as long as you don't expect it to be as good as the original.",Null,1,3,12 August 2012
Come and See," Horrors of war unlike anything you've ever seen
","It took director Elem Klimov eight years to get approval for this film. And it ended up being his last one. He was tapped out, done, out of ideas. He felt like he had nothing left to give.I can see why.Come and See is a historical anti-war film based on real events in Belarus under the onslaught of Nazi Germany. Our focal character is Flyora (Aleksey Kravchenko), a farm boy, who joins the partisan movement to oppose the Germans. Through his eyes we witness the atrocities committed by the Germans and witness horrors unlike anything I've ever seen on film screen.Klimov mixes horrifying, brutal hyperrealism with surrealism. Extreme close-ups, literal wading through mud, blood and human remains, gruesome battle wounds and people being burned alive are from time to time interwoven with almost dreamlike visions and long takes of fleeting serenity. This sounds artsy, but it actually works to bring all the horrors into even starker contrast.That being said, the violence, brutality and sheer horror do go so far in this film that at least I ended up becoming detached. I knew it was real and that these war crimes had really occurred in Belarus - the film is noted for its historical accuracy - but at some point I simply checked out. Which in some way makes it that much worse.It is a great film. A terrible, horrifying, nightmarish film. But great.",Null,0,0,5 April 2020
Scarface," Al Pacino is the man
","In many ways Scarface, a remake of a 1932 film of the same name, is the next logical step from movies such as The Godfather trilogy, Once Upon a Time in America and Goodfellas. All those gangster films take place in the early decades of the 20th century and heavily feature mafia or at least gangs closely associated with them. Whereas Scarface takes place in Florida in the 1980s and features Cuban and South American drug lords. Where the crime in those first mentioned films can be seen as civilized, code-bound and even somewhat admirable, Scarface lifts away the thin veneer of civility and throws us straight to the wolves.Tony Montana (Al Pacino) is a Cuban refugee working to rise to the top of the Florida drug business. His rough, uneducated manners constantly clash with those around him, but no one can claim he doesn't get results. But despite all his success he is a man deeply immersed in vice and eventually those start to consume his every waking hour.Scarface has been called cheesy. It's been called excessive, brutal and gory. It's been called clich√©d. And it's all those things, but what these critics fail to realize is the fact that it's meant to be all those. As I said, it's the next step. A gangster film where the main character doesn't hide the fact he's a completely irredeemable monster poorly disguising himself as a human being. And yet in Pacino's amazing hands even a character such as this one can have charisma, can pull us in. We still don't like him, but we can grudgingly respect his success.It's an ugly film. It's also charismatic, brutal, beautifully shot and well-acted. It features some truly memorable song tracks and has influenced an entire generation of film makers. Whether you like it or not, you cannot deny it its place in our cultural consciousness.",Null,0,1,7 February 2018
Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," Similar to the original
","Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows resembles the 2009 Sherlock Holmes in many ways. It has the exact same sense of humour, the actors haven't lost their touch in the slightest in the two passing years, the action scenes are very similar, as is the music and the pacing. And this is a good thing, it really is. If you liked the first film, then this won't disappoint at all and you may even like a bit more if its story is more to your liking.Yet personally I cannot help but feel that novelty played a large part in why I liked the 2009 so much. It was a version of Sherlock Holmes I hadn't seen before. But now with a sequel I don't have that. I've already seen much of what it has to offer before, and the new it has is not enough to pull me back in completely. It's also worth mentioning that don't really like Jared Horris as Professor Moriarty. His acting here is very workmanlike. It gets the job done, but I would have preferred to see more spirit from him, even little hints of brilliance and menacing intellect.Still, it's by no means a bad film. Downey Jr. and Law are still absolutely brilliant in their roles, the rest of the returning actors do a good job, technically it's just as professional as the previous one, the story is one of the classic Holmes stories told well and as a whole it'll keep you entertained. I wasn't as thrilled by it as I was with the original, but if you're looking for more like that one, this is an excellent film.",Null,0,1,2 May 2014
The Incredible Hulk," Great beginning
","This movie was solid, and that's really all I can say about it. It's very decent, easy to watch and as far as popcorn movies go, I've seen much, much worse. That said, it's still one of the weakest movies in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, in my opinion. Does that make it a bad film? Not at all, but for me this film had the least amount of awe in it. It just didn't immediately connect with me like the other films did.So what does the movie get right? Well, the cast is very solid. Edward Norton is a very good choice to play the main character, as he has that kind of geeky yet understatedly dangerous quality to him. You can see that he's a peaceful man, but you really shouldn't mess with him. Ergo, the perfect Hulk. The rest of the actors didn't disappoint either, although Tim Blake Nelson as Samuel Sterns was a bit too all over the place for my tastes. But that's just me, as I've heard that most people like him just fine. I personally enjoyed Liv Tyler very much as Banner's (ex-)girlfriend Elizabeth Ross. That woman has the ability to capture your attention by just walking into the scene. In addition, the action was very well choreographed, being fast-paced, creative and easy to follow. The special effects look a bit out-dated by today's standards, mostly those dealing with the Hulk himself, but they weren't that bad.So what didn't work? Well, I think the biggest problem is that the film takes itself perhaps a bit too seriously. It lacked that slight tongue in cheek humour that all the other Marvel films would have after this one. They also dealt with serious issues, but they were meant to entertain first and foremost. This film had some good jokes and I laughed from time to time, but it was still kind of dark for a superhero film. Not a bad thing, necessarily, if your main character is someone like, say, Daredevil, but when he's a humongous green giant... some humour wouldn't have gone amiss. And that's not to say that there isn't great tragedy to be found in the character of Hulk, and that is explored admirably in this film, but that tragedy needs humour to balance it.Furthermore, the story wasn't that captivating as a whole. It hit most of the right notes and was well-written for the most part, but I did find it the slightest bit boring. It just seemed to go by so fast. Hulk had a problem, Hulk was presented with a solution, Hulk tried to reach the said solution, Hulk encountered some resistance, rinse and repeat. Plus, the villain of the film wasn't that interesting either. He was played by an entertaining actor (Tim Roth), but he never really rose above the usual blood knight/wardog clich√©s.Still, it's not a bad film. If you're a fan of superhero movies, I'd definitely give this one a watch, and even if you're not, I'd say that there are worse ways to spend an hour or two.",Null,0,0,10 August 2013
The Monuments Men," Great deal of fun
","The Monuments Men is what we call an ensemble cast film where you get as many prolific actors you can pull in and then build the movie around their acting capabilities. And usually the end result is at least halfway decent, just because it's so much fun to see these people working together. Likewise here. Pretty much all of the actors are A-list and it shows. From George Clooney and Matt Damon to Bill Murray, Cate Blanchett and John Goodman, they all shine and have great conversations and scenes together.Not to say that it isn't otherwise a good movie. The setting is very intriguing, being based on a real life World War II unit of the same name, which mission was to find and protect the pieces of history, art and culture the Nazis had stolen or were trying to steal. The film feels passionately about the importance of art as a basis of culture and as a proof we have existed. Yet it's one thing to claim that art is important and quite another to ask good men and women to potentially sacrifice their lives for it. And the movie doesn't shy away from that problem. It makes its point and allows you to draw your own conclusions.As for the technical side of things, some people have claimed that the film feels a touch boring and scrambled because we follow so many small groups simultaneously, without ever really focusing on one. And I can see their point. It requires you to pay attention, to remember what is going on with each group and to not mind the pauses in the story lines. I personally didn't have problems with the storytelling and I found the whole experience a great deal of fun. It takes place in war times and acknowledges the human horror going on, but at its heart it's a treasure hunt and thus feels warmhearted and charming.If you're looking for a bit lighter war movie with great actors, excellent setup and beautiful production values, look no further.",Null,0,1,4 August 2014
Mission: Impossible III," Needs more Hoffman
","First of all, amazing first scene. One of the best I've seen in years. A great example of dropping the audience in the middle of it and letting them squirm. In a good way.If only the rest of the film could have been as good. Not to say the it's a bad film. Quite the opposite. Tom Cruise has rarely been as comfortable in a role as he's as Ethan Hunt, and that shows. There's a reason why there are so many of these films. It fills a comfortable niche somewhere between James Bond and Bourne. More gadgets than Bourne, but more gritty than Bond. Plus the heists. Can't forget those.I'd say M:i:III is not quite as good as the original, although it's a slight difference, but that it's miles better than its immediate predecessor. The plot is once again rather straightforward and mainly there to allow for cool sets and scenes. That being said, I do like that Hunt is at least attempting to settle down. I like the dynamic he has with his wife. And I like the addition of Simon Pegg into the franchise. Every franchise needs more Simon Pegg in them, but not all are fortunate enough to receive it.But what I really like is Philip Seymour Hoffman as the villain. From the very first scene he's brutally captivating. And yet he whispers half of his lines. And that's quite genuinely creepy. It's like he's always in control, always one step ahead. Even when he's obviously not, he remains for the most part unperturbed.Unfortunately he's not in the film nearly enough. He's there at the start and the film does revolve around him, but there are not that many scenes where he's at the forefront. And that's a shame.Still, it's more than passable action spy film, and well worth a watch if you're a fan of the previous films.",Null,0,1,5 January 2020
Lucky Number Slevin," The most Tarantino film that isn't the real deal
","I actually wouldn't have been surprised to find out that this film was at least partially created by Quentin Tarantino. It's not as gory as his usual fare, but it has a lot of his usual elements in it. Outlandish situation, great and memorable characters, lots of quirky dialogues and it even has one of his trademark actor, in this case Bruce Willis, in an important side role.And this isn't a bad thing at all and I'm not saying that Paul McGuigan is ripping off Tarantino. Quite the opposite. It's great that there's another director out there that can produce a film of this quality and style. Because make no mistake, this is a great film. Easily one of the best I've seen in a long time.What captures me the most are the dialogues and the characters. The whole situation about two mobster at war with one another is nothing new, but it's taken to such extremes that it becomes something new altogether. It's something straight out of a pulp story or a comic book, but in a good way. It's outlandish enough that you can sit back and enjoy, because you don't have to treat it like it's supposed to be 100 percent accurate, but it's real enough that you remain invested in the fates of its players. The same with dialogues. Weird and odd enough to capture your attention, but also fun and quirky enough to keep that attention.The plot is also surprising, unravels at the right pace and keeps you hooked till the very end. There are a few inconsistencies in the whole setup of two mobster silently glaring at each other across the street while their minions wage war beneath their feet, but it's nothing that would ruin the movie for you.What we have here is pure, undiluted fun. It's a movie of great characters, undeniable charisma and memorable scenes that all come together to form a cohesive whole. See it if you haven't already.",Null,0,0,25 December 2013
Requiem for a Dream," We're all nervous bundles of addictions and vices
","Darren Aronofsky is a problematic director for me to categorize. I can honestly say that I've liked all the films I've seen from him, but none of them are something I'd casually recommend to a friend. Some are even such that I doubt I'll ever rewatch them.Partly that's Aronofsky's scale. His films range from a deeply symbolic examination of time, love and pattern, where a man flies in space on a literal flying tree, to a pseudo-realistic portrayal of ballerina's struggles with her life. With Requiem for a Dream landing somewhere between these two extremes.The easiest theme to find in this film is that of addiction. The film follows four Coney Island people, three of them heavily addicted to heroin. But it's the fourth, the character of Sara Goldfarb (Ellen Burstyn), that provides the echo wall for this obvious addiction. The word addict immediately brings to mind mind-altering substances, but is someone so bound by media that she cannot live without it truly any different. And if she isn't, what does that say about the rest of us. We all have our vices, our favourite things. And those addictions can run deep, to places we don't care talk about.It's an unpleasant film to watch. Not in a way such as Trainspotting, which is mainly just filthy and unclean, though this film has heavy shades of that as well, but because Aronofsky focuses on the weirdness side of drug use. How taking heroin or other pills shatters the dream-reality barrier and shatters it in such a way that's scary beyond belief. It's dream, but in a way that lurks just behind the corner of your eyes, waiting.The best films are those that make you think. The ones you keep returning to in your thoughts. And this clearly belongs in that elusive category.",Null,0,0,5 February 2018
Your Name.," At its heart a love story yet managing to encompass so much more
","I was not familiar with Makoto Shinkai prior to this film, but having watched it I want to go and explore everything he has ever made. Because this film is easily on par with the best I've ever seen from Japan. The visuals, the characters, the depth of storytelling, the outlandishness of the central idea.The story goes that two Japanese teenagers, one a country girl longing for Tokyo and the other a city boy searching for a direction in life, start to exchange places as they go to sleep. The girl inhabits the boy's body for a day and vice versa. And as they try to solve and understand this mystery, the oddest possible long distance romance starts to bloom.And if that was all, it would be a lovely movie in its own right. The characters of Mitsuha and Taki are both excellently realized. They both act and react to this amazing situation very realistically and are both filled with personality. And it's not romance at first glance. How could it be? They clash, they argue, they mess with each other's lives. But from that fire an understanding starts to emerge and in the end you totally buy that these two would be perfect for one another. One of the best on-screen romances I've ever seen.But the thing is, the movie is so much more than that. It's about the life in the rural Japan versus that in the city. It's about being young and undecided. It's about friendships and those long summers before a major shift in your life. They even throw in a great action mystery towards the end, without it in any way taking away from the central story. Quite the opposite in fact. The mystery actually explains and solves many of the seeming inconsistencies in the story.Plus the visuals, the score, all the technicals. Superb, grand, majestic. Studio Ghibli will always be my favourite for its old time charm and the beauty of its hand-drawn craft, but Shinkai comes as close to that impossible standard as it is possible to come with computers.Though, if I had to nitpick, I would wonder why the film needs a pop song number in the middle of it. But that's the only crack the film has. The only one.Your Name is a wonderful film. It takes numerous strings, plots and characters and seemingly without effort weaves from them a story that is as true and will remain as true as the life it's imitating. Highly recommended for all.",Null,3,6,25 June 2017
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Much better than I remembered
","Episode I is the best movie in the Star Wars prequel trilogy. Now, before you dig your pitchforks and torches from the mothballs, allow me to explain myself. Episode I is universally hated among the Star Wars fans because it was such a disappointment. Our expectations were set too high, and thus we were let down when the new Star Wars film didn't meet the quality of the originals. But, then we realized that we had expected too much, lowered our expectations accordingly and thus the next two films weren't met with such disdain.But, having watched the prequel trilogy again after many years, I can safely say that this film is the one that got closest to being a true Star Wars film. It matches the originals the best in tone, general plot and overall quality. And yes, it is a flawed film in many ways. They made young Anakin Skywalker too saint-like, the pod race scene goes on forever, they started to build the romance too early, the rise of the siths and the Galactic Empire can be seen coming from miles away, they added Jar Jar. The list goes on.But they also got a lot of things right. The plot is actually very good, in my opinion. It starts out excitingly, flows smoothly and actually feels like the original. That is to say, it feels like an adventure. The original films told about galaxy in peril, about a rebel alliance trying to overcome a tyrannical empire, but they told it from the point of view of an individual. Likewise, here we follow two jedi knights attempting to negotiate a peace between two factions and getting tangled into something much bigger and more far-reaching than they had anticipated. And, I can be honest and applaud the next two films for trying to take the franchise into a new direction, but I also have to be honest and admit that it doesn't work very well.The score is also very good, the backgrounds and the various character, tech and costume designs are still absolutely stunning and well-executed, the returning characters are portrayed accurately, most of the new characters work very well and the whole world feels suitably Star Warsian, while also turning back the clock and showing us the galaxy before the tyranny of Darth Sidious.Is it a perfect film? Absolutely not. Does it come close to matching the originals? No. Does it have problems? A lot of them. Is it a bad film and deserving of the scorn heaped upon it? I don't think so.",Null,2,5,1 November 2015
3:10 to Yuma," Rehash of old tropes
","A remake of the 1957 film of the same name. A poor and struggling rancher (Christian Bale) agrees to join the escort for a big time robber king (Russell Crowe) that is being taken to a prison train in Yuma. While at the same time the robber's gang plot his escape.3:10 to Yuma can be seen as a love letter to old time westerns. Being a remake it of course uses pretty much the same conventions, story lines and characters as those films, but it gives it a new look, a new coat of paint if you will. Higher budget means fancier clothes, more detailed sets and a larger pixel count. Which is of course appreciated.Russell Crowe is also at the top of his game. A fine character and fitting Crowe's usual mannerisms perfectly. Unfortunately the same cannot be said about Bale. I'm usually a fan of his, but he also has certain mannerisms he cannot escape. And here they didn't serve to make the character more interesting. Quite the opposite.There's also the problem that they tried to modernize the values of the story a bit too much. I haven't seen the original, but from what I can surmise, it was pretty typical as far as westerns go. Tough as hide heroes, nefarious villains, strong pioneer women. Whereas this film tries to throw in rebellious teenagers, racial commentary, evil land barons, Native Americans, hidden hearts of gold and a twist ending meant to tug at your heartstrings. Making the whole film feel bloated and disjointed as far as values and themes go.Still, for a remake this ain't half bad and for a modern western it's surprisingly good. Plus I freely admit that the film was mostly ruined for me because I found Bale's character and his son so annoying. That will probably not be the case for most viewers.",Null,0,0,29 June 2017
The Expendables 2," Much better than the first
","In my opinion the first Expendables film wasn't bad at all. Rather it was painfully average, which immediately tells you that something had gone wrong, because with that lineup of actors it should have been legendary. It wasn't, but fortunately it was big enough success that they made another one, and luckily Stallone stepped down from directing. Plus the writers seemed to have realized what worked and what didn't, the action was given bit of a boost and the character interactions were improved. All in all this is one of those rare sequels where the flaws of the original are acknowledged and the creative team has learned from their mistakes. We don't see these very often, so this a real gem in that regard.That being said, this is still not as legendary as it should be. I feel like Stallone still hasn't realized that sometimes you have to go back to your roots. You have to realize just what made you great in the first place. And when it comes to these guys, it's the cheesiness. These movies take themselves too seriously in my opinion. I can realize that this is Stallone's new style, he has shown it before in movies like the latest Rambo and Rocky films, and in those films it actually works, but the whole idea behind The Expendables franchise is a bit cheesy to begin it, so why not take advantage of the fact and go all the way.Though, in the case of The Expendables 2, they have added a bit of cheesiness. The film is much funnier, for starters. There are a lot more one-liners, the visual jokes (especially in the opening action scene) are hilarious and the characters manage to work off each other much better than before. What's more, the characters feel much more like real people this time around. They feel like a team and everyone gives solid performances. Liam Hemsworth for example is very good in his role as the newbie.Also, Schwarzenegger and Willis. The scenes with them are some of the best this movie can offer. The one-liners, the sarcasm, the sheer badassery. Gods, I've missed these two.On the downside there's Chuck Norris and the villain, played by Van Damme. And don't get me wrong, Norris is very good. He's very, very good. I just feel that his cameo went on a bit too long. It should have been one scene, one conversation, but then it just went on and on... Too much good stuff. And when it comes to Van Damme, he's okay in his role, but this just goes to showcase just how important a charismatic villain truly is. Van Damme's character is just a bad guy, nothing more. He was there, he was something of a threat and that's it, unfortunately.Nevertheless, this is a good action film. There's still room for improvement and I'm really looking forward to the third part of the trilogy, but as a standalone action film this delivers beautifully. It's action-packed, it has good characters, it has a reasonably good plot, it's funny, it's fast-paced and it has all of your favourite action stars. Recommended.",Null,2,3,25 September 2012
Skyfall," One of the best
","Casino Royale was a great Bond film. It respected the traditions, but set out immediately to do its own thing. And it succeeded. Then came Quantum of Solace, which wasn't all that good. The plot had no character, the novelty had worn off and it was very forgettable. Gladly this movie managed to rise above its predecessor and resemble Casino Royale more closely in style and substance. It's a great Bond film and a perfect one to celebrate the anniversary.What I like most about Skyfall and Casino Royale is that they're aware of the deep and rich history, part of which they are about to become, but they refuse to be bound by it. They have their own idea of what the character of James Bond should be like and they don't care if someone doesn't like that idea or would rather see nothing changed. Yet they don't disregard those traditions. Skyfall has all the hallmarks of a proper Bond film from a blazing beginning opening action sequence to the Bond girls and the over the top villain. They're all there, but they're not the main part of the story. They're more of acknowledging and respecting nods than restricting clich√©s. Though I must say that the few times that the film makers decided to stick with the traditions, it really works. Perhaps the best example is the villain, played by Javier Bardem, who's a contender for the creepiest and most unsettling villain Bond has yet to face. His introductory scene is one of the most brilliant prolonged monologues that I've seen in a long time. He feels like a Bond villain, I can recognize him as a Bond villain, yet he's still a creature of his own making, something slightly new and twisted. A statement, which pretty accurately describes the rest of the film as well.Not to say that the film is without any flaws, as it isn't perfect. While I praise Bardem's take on the role, the character that he plays isn't developed as well as he could have been. Now he gets an amazing introduction, but then he just sorts of stagnates to a generic kill it because it insulted me once kind of bad guy, who's devoid of any great motives or feelings. He's still not awful, but he could have been better. The same with the third act of the film, which tries to through too much in at the last minute, leaving as scratching our heads in the process. A more leaner, compact storyline would have served the movie better.Still, as a whole this is a great film. Is it the best Bond yet? Probably not, but it's there in the top five, or at least the top ten. Definitely worth a watch for the fans of both the old and the new.",Null,1,8,22 November 2012
Catch Me If You Can," Charming
","This was the movie that personally convinced me that DiCaprio had a future as an actor beyond Titanic. People used dismiss him as that kid from Titanic, I did as well, but he has grown to become one of Hollywood's top actors and I personally saw this coming while watching this film.Catch Me If You Can is also one of those films that I'd recommend if someone had no idea who Steven Spielberg was and wanted to give one of his movies a try. Because in many ways it has a lot of his characteristics in it. It's seemingly light-hearted, has an A-list cast, has a great score and the story is pure entertainment, yet the movie also takes it time, here and there, to address slightly darker themes - in this case the reason why Frank Abagnale Jr. (DiCaprio) grew up to become such a trickster.The movie rides heavily on the charisma and acting abilities of its two main stars, DiCaprio and Hanks, and in this case there's really nothing wrong with it. The story is decent enough to support these two and it's a valid choice to have your movie focus on the characters, especially if they're interesting enough, like they are in here. That's the essence of a heist movie, which this movie really is, even though it's not about a single con.And that's this movie. Its focus on entertainment keeps it from being a solid nine or ten star film, but only just. As it is, it's a fun little romp that you're sad to see come to an end. Heavily recommended to fans of heist genre, and for those that like charismatic performances and fun little twists.",Null,2,3,19 December 2013
Iron Man 3," Lacks innovation
","To me this is one of the lesser Marvel films, meaning it belongs to the same category as Iron Man 2 and The Incredible Hulk in terms of quality. By all objective accounts it's still a good film, don't get me wrong, but it cannot hold a candle to the better Marvel films.Why, you may ask? A couple of reasons. First, the general plot. It's simply the same story that we've already seen in the two previous Iron Man films. In the first one it was great. Science, technology, gorgeous flying around, missiles, explosions, quick-witter banter, Robert Downey Jr. in the role of his life. The second one also benefited from those same qualities and failed for other reasons. But now, in the third installment of the franchise? The novelty has truly worn off. Sure, one might argue that it's nice to have a formula and that it wouldn't feel like an Iron Man story without certain elements. I argue that it'd be nice to explore other aspects of Tony Stark's character instead of watching him endlessly battle enemies of his own making. At least this time the villain isn't just a carbon copy of him, only evil. Well... he kind of is, but at least not as blatantly.And to the film's credit, there is some new ground covered and it's nice that the plot takes the events of The Avengers into account. Downey Jr. is still a fantastic Tony Stark and in this film he's given a chance to explore and play the character at his lowest point, which works pretty well indeed. The action also works, the suits are still gorgeous, the special effects beautiful and it's a professionally done film in every way possible.The second problem, however, are the characters, at least the new ones. They're simply not all that interesting. There are a couple of good twists, but when a guy walks into the room and he's so smarmy that he might as well carry a flashing neon sign with VILLAIN written on it, it's not that much of a surprise when he turns out to be the bad guy. The new kid sidekick they bring in is also aggravating, annoying and needed about as much as an ice cone machine in Greenland.Iron Man 3 is not a bad film. It's perfectly functional as a summer blockbuster and a good popcorn film by all accounts. But when you compare it to the Phase One movies, its flaws start to show.",Null,1,3,5 July 2015
Raiders of the Lost Ark," One of the best adventure films ever made
","One of the most well-known films in history and certainly one of the crown jewels of Steven Spielberg's career. Which is saying something. The character of Indiana Jones has become a pop culture icon and probably the bane of every archaeology professor who has had to explain to his students that no, the movies have almost nothing to do with real archaeology.Still, whether it's grave robbing, tomb raiding or whatever else, this film is a total blast of pulp adventure goodness. From the first iconic scene of the dirty and grumbled Harrison Ford turning to stare at the camera in an age when most cinema heroes were squeaky clean and flawless to the main story about the lost Ark of the Covenant and the desperate race against the Nazis, who want to claim its powers for their own war effort.This movie has numerous upsides, but what I personally like the most about it is its sense of adventure. The film takes us all over the globe, from the temples of Peru to the Himalayas and finally to Cairo. Each location is a great place for an adventure and given a weight of history, fun and excitement. The characters are also a big part of the film. Indiana Jones of course being the main event, but all the side characters are also memorable and fun. From Indiana's feisty ex Marion (Karen Allen) to the steadfast and boastful Sallah (John Rhys- Davies). The villains are also entertaining and memorable as only Nazis can be. It's a joy to watch them lose.And do I even need to say any more? You've all seen this film. If you haven't, congratulations on finally being old enough to be allowed to see it. Enjoy. Or, if you're older than that, shame on you!",Null,0,0,6 July 2017
Spartacus," Possibly Kubrick's greatest epic
","Stanley Kubrick was a director of vast talent. And by vast I mean that his movies are really not much alike. Sure, he liked to stick to certain themes, like war, madness and ego, but his genres varied wildly. 2001: A Space Opera is a scifi horror thriller. The Killing is a mobster heist film. Barry Lyndon is a period piece.And in Spartacus he dabbled with the genre of epic historical drama, akin to Ben-Hur and The Ten Commandments. The movie is about Spartacus, a real historical figure, who among others led a slave uprising, known in history as the Third Servile War, against the Roman Republic in the 1st century BC, just before the rise of Julius Caesar.And the movie certainly feels like an epic. It's over three hours long, takes place in ancient times, deals with fates of nations and is about a singular figure defining the shape of their time.Yet it moves with effortless grace. It's over three hours long, but it sure doesn't feel like it. The interlude helps, giving a natural place to pause the film and visit the fridge, or what will you. But it's also in the storytelling. Spartacus (Kirk Douglas) goes through many phases in his lifetime and these help break up the story into segments. The acting is also phenomenal, as are the sets and the cinematography in general. Rarely has Ancient Rome looked more alive, grandeur and magnificent.If I had to nitpick, I'd say the ending is a bit of a downer. It's historically accurate, certainly, but that only makes it worse.Still, what we have here is a gem of a movie. Vast in scope with a sense of scope. Definitely worth a watch if historical epics hold a place in your heart.",Null,1,2,27 November 2019
E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," Good movie, but not as great as I remember it
","Like most people, I first saw this film as a little child. I think I had just learned to read so I could follow the subtitles. And it was great. Childhood hijinks, bizarre aliens, chases, toys, skipping school to hang with your new friend, getting drunk (yeah...), making excuses to your mom, distrusting adults, high adventures and grand plans. What's not to like? But now, as I rewatched it for the first time as an adult, it just didn't grab me as well as it did. It's still an interesting movie and certainly iconic on every level, from visuals to the characters to the story. But somehow it seemed hollow to me, like the story wasn't as deep as it needed to be to really pull us in. And that's a problem. It's a simple kid's story trying to function as a young adults movie. Not that kid's stories cannot be deep, of course they can, but they're usually rather simple in structure. Like E.T., which goes basically like this: boy finds something strange in the forest, he brings it home or it follows him home, he tries to hide it from his parents, they become the bestest of best friends, but eventually the boy has to release his new pet back into the wild because the pet is not meant to live with humans. Simple, allegoric, message-teaching. The problems start when you try to introduce the big bad government as the antagonists or you try to include scenes with sexual or alcoholic references. Because they stand out and they seem superfluous.It still works, don't get me wrong. E.T. is a cultural classic for a reason. Sure, there's a certain amount of love it or hate it to the alien's creepy muteness, sure the children are rather clich√©d, sure the mom's willful ignorance requires a lot of willing suspension of disbelief. But when it works, when the bike suddenly lifts from the air, when the children are completely enthralled by their new friends, when the alien craft lands on Earth. Then it's magic.I theorize that E.T. works really well for you if you're a child yourself or if you want to be a child again. It's a great movie about childhood. Unfortunately as a twenty-something I don't really fall into either of those categories, so it didn't quite work for me right now.",Null,1,4,1 April 2015
Casablanca," Intriguing look at history
","Casablanca was filmed and released before the end of World War II, making it an interesting time capsule. A look at history, at time period where everything hung on balance, where everything was uncertain. United States had already joined the war effort by this point, but there were still years of war ahead before victory could be claimed.And as it is, it really works. World War II provides the background, the drive behind almost all of the characters, but it's not really on the foreground. It's there, certainly, but the story is more about the characters than it is about the war. And I find that to be the right decision. These characters are driven to their breaking point by the war, but it's much more interesting for us to see what they do in that breaking point than it is for us to understand exactly what that point is.And the characters are really good. Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman are both phenomenal actors, legends of their field, and it really shows here. Bogart especially steals the whole show, and it's no wonder that the whole film is pretty much one iconic quote after another. The lines and deliveries are just that good.Casablanca is one of those films where everything just works. The story, the dialogue, the characters, the style, the pacing, the whole nine yards. One of the classics for a reason and definitely a must see film for all fans of the moving pictures.",Null,0,2,13 June 2016
Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter," Great basic idea, boring execution
","On the paper this film sounds great. One of the most iconic presidents of all time traveling across the early USA, killing vampires with an axe-shotgun and taking names. Sure it's corny and over the top, but sometimes that's exactly what we need to be entertained.On some levels, this film delivers exactly what it promises. There is a lot of fighting and many action scenes, which are usually very solid and entertaining. Especially the numerous slow-motion shots were very pleasing to look at in my opinion, though that's just my personal cup of tea, as I know that some don't like them at all. Guess I haven't gotten my fair fill of them yet. Additionally, the lore and mythos of this film manage to work on a reasonable level. The vampires aren't anything special, but they're not laughably erroneous either, like some others I could mention if I wasn't sure that you all already know which vampires I'm talking about. So the action and the vampires do work. Sure some of the action scenes are a bit too... outlandish and hard to take seriously, but I wasn't really expecting anything else, so it didn't bother me all that much. Add in some nice period costumes and a decent, though a tad forgettable score, and the film has a nice basic framework all set up.So what went wrong? Well, the movie is pretty boring for one, which is astonishing given that it's a film about Abraham Lincoln. Killing vampires. With an axe-shotgun. In slow-motion. For that concept to end up being boring is just plain wrong, but unfortunately it's the truth. The actors all do a decent job, but the characters that they play are colourless, without any characteristics aside from a few initially established quirks. One of them is a womanizer, one of them is a bit naive, one of them is evil, and that's about it. Furthermore, the story isn't all that exciting either. Yet again it's not bad, but it's just... colourless. No creativity, no original ideas, no soul. It's there to move the film from one action scene to another, nothing more.And really, in some movies the nonexistent story can be forgiven, especially if their purpose is to be nothing more than an action-packed slugfest. But usually those movies are self-conscious about the lack of story and compensate by being extremely flashy and showboating. This film however actually seems to believe that it has a worthwhile story to tell and thus tries it hardest, making it ever so worse in the process.So to whom I might recommend this film? Well, if vampire films are your thing and you've resigned yourself to the fact that the story isn't going to be anything special, then I think that there are worse ways to spend an hour or two. This movie isn't terrible by any means, and for the fans of fantasy action it's even somewhat decent. If only the story had had a bit more originality, then this might have become a great guilty pleasure for me.",Null,0,1,26 November 2012
Who Framed Roger Rabbit," Unbelievably impressive
","This movie has gone down in history as one of Disney's greatest comebacks. The 80s were not so good for Walt's legacy and the corporation was struggling to make films of true quality. And then they came up with this little gem. Seamless incorporation of live-action and animation, astonishing technical innovations, a cavalcade and gathering of beloved animation characters unlike anything they audiences had seen before. It was a revolution and largely helped launch Disney's Renaissance, their greatest golden age to date.And it has endured the test of time remarkably well. This film is older than I am, but its message of acceptance, endurance and the ability to face the world with a laugh is still as relevant as it was back then. It's a timeless movie, and even though it is known for its technical achievements, its story has enough depth to stand on par with them.The characters and actors are also delightfully varied and played by topnotch actors. We have the no-nonsense, deadbeat, humourless private detective Eddie Valiant (Bob Hoskins), who still manages to deliver some of the best punchlines through his deadpan delivery. We have Roger Rabbit (Charles Fleischer) and his wife Jessica Rabbit (Kathleen Turner), who manage to be an effective and heartwarming couple despite their differences, or perhaps because of them. And then we have Judge Doom (Christopher Lloyd), who could not be more perfect for his role, especially keeping in mind the ending. All these characters have great chemistry together, they all have great lines and together they're a riot of laughs, action and humour.Who Framed Roger Rabbit is definitely worth a watch for the whole family. Its animation, charm and humour will appeal even to the youngest, yet its story has a message that will provoke thoughts even from the worst critics of these so-called kids films.",Null,1,1,10 March 2015
One Hundred and One Dalmatians," Inferior spiritual successor to Lady and the Tramp
","What really bothers me about this film is the fact we had just gotten a much better film about animated dogs from Disney. It was called Lady and the Tramp, and it was amazing. As such, a tale about even more dogs, this time without the warmth and the charm of the previous ones, just didn't feel as successful.Problem number one, Pongo and Perdita. I just don't get these two. They're supposed to be the main couple, the heroic parents who save their children, but I don't get anything from them. Their owners, Roger and Anita, are a great couple, one of the best of the so called beta couples Disney has ever done. But the main couple. Nope, don't work.The second problem, the copying. A lot of this movie's plot lines and scenes have been copied from previous Disney movies. Mainly from Lady and the Tramp. It's not really all that noticeable if you don't watch them back to back, but if you do, it's kind of blatant. Plus the animation style utilizes a lot of copying because of the new Xerox method of animation that allowed them to animate all those individual dalmatian puppies without going stark raving mad. Which I give them props for. This movie looks noticeably rougher when compared to the ones before it, but it is a very impressive technical achievement anyway.The first good side, the villain. Cruella De Vil has since achieved almost legendary status as a Disney villain, and for a reason. She's petty, nauseatingly glamorous without any of the grace that usually goes with it, just one push away from cuckoo land and absolutely mad about fur even when not pushed. In a word she's memorable, even though her actual plan is really not that ambitious when compared to her brethren. She just wants a coat.The second good side, the music. This film has some great tunes, from the classic Cruella De Vil to the opening scene with its early 20th century London suburbia.As a whole this movie is something of an uneven package. It has definite upsides, but also equally as definite downsides. It is a very good film, don't get me wrong, great even, but only when not compared to other Disney films too vigorously. Still, definitely a classic children's film by any meaning of the term.",Null,0,3,25 July 2015
John Wick," Some of the best cinema fighting seen in a while
","Keanu Reeves has clearly found his niche as a brilliant martial arts actor, playing the role of various action heroes executing flawless and beautiful fight choreographies, taking names, shooting bad guys, breaking a few necks, et cetera. Absolutely nothing wrong with that and this, his most recent action film, is definitely worth a watch for the visuals alone.John Wick (Reeves) is a retired assassin and hired gun, who has recently gone through an immense loss and is just getting back to his feet. Enter the son of a Russian mobster, young enough that he doesn't recognize this dark legend of the underworld. After an insult gone too far, John Wick once again feels the blood boiling within him and the rest of the film is pretty much nothing else but his one man war against the Russian mafia. And you know what? I don't really need anything else from the story. These kinds of revenge action films work because of their style and because of their characters. Sure, it's nice if the story has some surprising twists, but they don't really need it.In this case the movie definitely has style, bucket loads of it. The fight scenes are phenomenally well-shot, well-choreographed and well-executed. Especially the first few. The film also manages to build nice mythos around its world. Like the gold coins these assassins use to pay for everything, or the whole code of conduct they all seem to operate under. Wick is a legend in the underworld and it's great to see him casually nodding to other killers and having them lift their hats in return. Small things like that really deepen the world considerably and make it interesting to follow.Unfortunately, where the film falters a bit is the cast of characters. None of them are bad and most of them are played by talented actors, but they are pretty much text book as far as the writing goes. Stereotypical, failing to surprise and mainly there to move the plot from one action scene to another. Plus, while the actors are not bad by any means, none of them are what you would call A-list, with the exception of Reeves, and even he's a bit debatable nowadays. Well, okay, there's Willem Dafoe, but he's in a minor role.All in all John Wick is definitely worth a watch for all fans of action, especially if you're into the martial arts and gun-fu subgenres.",Null,2,5,2 December 2015
Chinatown," Classic neo-noir
","One of the penultimate film-noir films and one of the best Jack Nicholson movies as well. Chinatown is a slowly unraveling mystery story at its best, each scene slowly building the suspense, offering hints to the final solution, yet that final twist is there to left us gaping in horror and awe.The movie's greatest strengths are its iron tight script and its cast. The story takes place in the early 20th century LA, during a time of great drought. J.J. 'Jake' Gittes (Nicholson), a private detective of some skill, is hired to spy on one of the players in the so called Water Wars. Not everything goes as planned and Gites finds himself pulled deeper into the mystery, mostly against his will, as it often happens. Along the way he encounters murder, corruption, old feuds, high class women, rich tycoons and misleading answers. It's considered one of the classic film-noir movies for a reason, yet it updates the formula somewhat in good neo-noir fashion by deviating from the old character stereotypes - a welcome change.Jack Nicholson is also on a roll in this movie. He has been born to play characters such as these and Gites might very well be one of his best. He's everything. Arrogant, sly, quite the ladies man, intelligent, witty, too large for the world and all around bad ass. The rest of the cast are up to the task, with special mention going to old Hollywood legend John Huston, playing one of the water tycoons.Chinatown is a must see for all ones of detective and mystery stories. It's an all around well-acted, -produced, -directed and -executed film. One of the classics.",Null,1,2,24 November 2014
A Star Is Born," About creativity, staying honest and learning to trust
","Bradley Cooper's directorial debut marks the third remake of this particular story. Fourth, if you count the 2013 Bollywood musical. The story is about an aging country rock singer, whose career is at its final stretch. Then he runs into a girl with an amazing voice and becomes instantly fascinated, if not outright smitten.The film stars Cooper in the leading role and Lady Gaga as Ally, the girl with the voice. And these two are magnificent. The role of Ally is of course practically tailor-made for Gaga, but I'm still blown away by her acting talent. The same with Cooper, except that with him I'm blown away by the fact that he can actually sing really well. These two approach the same point from different directions and this build some amazing chemistry between them.And it's good that these two work as well as they do, because the movie would absolutely fall apart if they did not. Mind you, the story itself has some depth to it. I especially like its point of view on talent and what you should do with it. Does an artist have a responsibility to use their talent to say something meaningful or is it simply enough to make people enjoy themselves? But in the end it's the love story, the evolving relationship between these two that keeps the movie going.Now, I have to admit that I did not enjoy the ending. It's the same as in the previous movies, but it still didn't feel honest to me. The movie was not building towards such an ending. I felt cheated.Still, a very good movie. Borderline great. Fantastic performances, really good storytelling, good music, some poignancy and pleasing on the technical side of things as well. Recommended.",Null,1,2,30 November 2018
Gravity," An experience over story
","Gravity is one of those movies you regret not seeing in the biggest theater possible. The way it looks, how the camera moves around, the angles they go with, the special effects, the whole visual package is just phenomenal to look at. Easily one of the most impressive films in a while when it comes to the whole 'moving pictures' aspect.Gravity keeps things simple and focuses on the essentials. It is meant to be an experience, rather than a statement of something profound. That doesn't mean there isn't a story or even a point to be found within it, but they are both secondary to the vision. Kind of like a Nirvana song. There are lyrics, but the music came first.And what music, or visuals in this case, it is. Gravity steals your breath away from the very first scene, with a long establishing shot where the camera simple circles around the space station from one astronaut to another, without a single cut to be seen. Amazingly beautiful, which the rest of the movie easily keeps up until the very end. I'm also impressed how full they managed to make the space look. This could have simply been white human blobs floating against the darkness of vacuum, but through good angles and orbital location, they manage to make it look better than that.The rest of the aspects work very well as well. The absence of sound in space is utilized well and the actors are all at the top of their game. Though, to be fair, whereas Sandra Bullock completely submerges herself into the role of Ryan Stone, giving a very impressive performance, with George Clooney I always saw only George Clooney in space. Still a good performance, though.Gravity will pull you into an unforgettable journey and is one of the most ambitious and impressive scifi films to come out in years. Definitely worth checking out.",Null,1,2,12 July 2014
Mulan," Fantastic, thrilling adventure with a great message for kids
","Fa Mulan is by far my favourite Disney protagonist. If we're simply talking about Disney heroines, that might be Jasmine from Aladdin or Esmeralda from The Hunchback of Notre Dame, but Mulan is far more than a simple heroine. She's the hero of her story. She is the one that causes things to happen. Sure, there have been lots of female protagonists before her, but in their case it was always the case of things happening to them and them reacting to it. Mulan's story is entirely her own doing. She didn't need to go to war for her dad. She chose to, despite all the problems it would bring her. It's a small distinction, but an important one.Furthermore, it's an amazing film even without our badass name-taking, sword-swinging, Hun-defeating, pole-climbing, ancient-bazooka-wielding hero. After a couple of rather flawed Renaissance films, it returns to form with all aspects of the film working beautifully together and with no discernible faults. Sure, some people claim that Shan Yu, the villain, is a tad boring and one-dimensional. And yeah, I can see where they're coming from, but personally I like him. He's menacing and unstoppable, with an intellect to match. He attacks China because it's there, no other reason needed. Having him singing villain songs would water him down.Then there's of course Mushu, the dragon guardian, voiced by Eddie Murphy. And yeah, that is an odd, odd casting choice, which I'm not one hundred percent convinced works. Sure, he is the best source of comedy in the film by far and it's very good comedy. One of Murphy's best roles, in fact. But he is also pretty distracting from time to time, keeping us from fully immersing ourselves. It doesn't really ruin the film, and I'm not convinced that a more traditional voice would have worked any better either, but it is a thing to ponder about.The songs are also great, though perhaps not Disney's best effort either. Though, keeping in mind that this is Disney, that's a pretty high bar to reach, so you cannot really fault the movie for failing. And they are good songs, with I'll Make a Man Out of You being a contender for that elusive best effort status.I love that this movie exists. That Fa Mulan as a character exists. That there is a movie that uncompromisingly tells us an adventure story with a female hero, in this age where we still cannot get any movies with female leads, unless they're romantic comedies or dramas about the difficulties of love. That's thankfully slowly changing and this movie will be remembered as an important milestone on that journey.",Null,1,1,24 November 2015
Se7en," It'll crawl under your skin like maggots
","I first saw Seven when my Finnish teacher showed it to our class. I was perhaps 14 at the time. And it left a lasting impact. This crime thriller, this gothic neo-noir masterpiece where people are brutally murdered according to the Seven Deathly Sins as recognized by the Catholic Church. Down the line it led me to Hellblazer, Neil Gaiman, the whole Vertigo Universe, film noir, Gotham, Edgar Allan Poe, et cetera. But I think it all started with this film.Se7en is one of those films you can only see once for the first time. If that makes any sense to you. I've seen it multiple times throughout the years, but none of those viewings can compare with the first time, when everything is new, each murder scene is more gruesome than the last, and you have no idea what the serial killer is up to. And in a way it's sad. If i could, I would erase this movie from my memory, just so I could experience watching it for the first time all over again. Its twists and turns are that good. But I can't. And that makes me a bit mad. Which makes it a great film.I've always struggled with reviewing this film. Usually my friends have at least heard about the film and how great it is, so I only have to warn them about how stomach churning it is. But what do you say about it to someone who has never heard of it, without spoiling something essential about it?I honestly don't have a clue. Suffice to say, it's one of my favourite films of all time. It's violent, it's bloody, it's absolutely macabre. But it's also the best film Morgan Freeman has ever made. It's the best film Brad Pitt has ever made. It's the best film David Fincher has ever made. It's the best film (redacted) has ever made. Not for the easily spooked, but if you're willing to gaze into the abyss, this abyss will gladly gaze into you.",Null,0,0,5 February 2020
Se7en," One of the best thrillers of all time
","I admire this film, I really do. It's setup is not the most original. Two cops, one young and aggressive, one old and weary, try to catch a serial killer, whose murders are frankly a bit too gruesome to really exist. And yet, because of the pure acting talent and because of the storytelling ability of the director, it manages to become one of those films that I will remember until the day I die. It's full of shots and scenes that are just so perfect, so fitting, that they instantly touch something within you. There honestly isn't a single scene that doesn't immediately catch your interest.So, is it a perfect movie? Actually no. I mainly have a problem with the ending. Don't get me wrong, it's a brilliant ending, one that you absolutely didn't see coming, but the logic behind it is a bit faulty. The rest of the murders were all very poetic, full of twisted justice against the sinners. But the final two... they're clever, in a way, but they don't seem to fit the pattern as neatly as the previous ones. But this is me nitpicking. It's still a brilliant movie, whether or not I would have done the ending any different. And I would have, but I can respect the filmmakers' decision to make it like so. There's logic behind that decision. Whether or not that logic fits the logic of the movie is a matter of taste, really.So yeah, definitely one of those movie that you have to see at least once. Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt are both immensely talented actors, the style and cinematography are both flawless and the story is masterful. Highly recommended.",Null,0,2,4 February 2012
Star Trek," Shallow action-romp
","I'm a very casual Star Trek fan, and such I had great interest in this movie as an entryway movie into the franchise. Alas, while J. J. Abrams has directed a lot of films I've really liked, this is definitely not one of them.First of all, I don't like the characters. I'm not hugely familiar with the original TV series, but these still ring false to me. Kirk (Chris Pine) is too brash even for Kirk, Spock (Zachary Quinto) is oddly way too emotional, Scotty (Simon Pegg) engineers very little, if anything at all, and so on. While there were some nice additions and changes - I liked Uhura (Zoe Saldana), for example - they were often in minor roles.The film is also riddled with plot holes. Which is not that surprising because it is a time travel story - it's hard to avoid plot holes with those - but quite often these plot holes and oddities were there just because the film wanted for its main characters to shine. We have a huge Federation, but it's still a bunch of academy cadets that end up doing everything. Granted, that was pretty much the case in the TV series as well, but in here those crimes are especially egregious.And while the battles and the special effects do look nice, they're still oddly married to the limitations of the TV series. The ship of the main antagonist almost looks like it came from a particularly fancy student film. That's how cheap looking it is. And that's just from Abrams and his crew trying needlessly to imitate the look of the original shoestring budget TV series.Not a fan. I did not like the characters, I did not like the plot, I did not like the look. Hopefully the sequel ends up introducing some radical changes.",Null,10,14,3 September 2018
Fight Club," Film that you hate to love
","I still think that I shouldn't like this film. That I shouldn't allow myself to like this film. Its worldview is so ugly, so nihilistic and corrupted, that you actually fear that your own morals darken just by looking at it. Sure you justify it to yourself by telling that it's actually telling us not to give into hate, not to believe that our lives have no meaning, not to realize that we're just corporate puppets. And yes, the film actually carries a warning undertone, showing why people like Tyler Durden cannot be correct.It's hard to tell yourself that when you're watching the actual film though. Because in all honesty Brad Pitt is so good in this film, so magnificently charismatic, that it's no wonder that some people actually went and started their own fight clubs. No wonder that Tyler Durden has been voted the best movie character of all time numerous times. The man is that good in his role. And it is a distinct possibility that our society would be better off if he weren't, because in all honesty Tyler Durden is everything that we shouldn't be.And that's what makes this film so damn good. It is the ugly underbelly of human condition, of modern society. It's not nice to look at, it won't make you feel any better, but damn if isn't one heck of a trip to experience. This movie is so convinced that what it's saying is the God's truth that you have no choice but to be pulled in, even momentarily.But it's not just the message. It's a great movie even without the story and the character of Tyler Durden. The style, the art direction, the camera work, the rest of the cast, the music, the dirty jokes, the plot twists, the sheer ugly charisma. You might never like this film, no matter how often you can force yourself to watch it, but you can never deny that it's not a brilliant piece of film making. And that is why I think everyone should see it at least once. Because it's the end of the spectrum, as of now. You'll appreciate life more after you've realized that this is a work of fiction and that you're not living in it yourself.",Null,3,7,24 April 2013
Akira," Brutal violence, deep ideas, masterful animation
","Akira is a giant in its field. Based on a highly popular manga series and directed by said manga's original writer Katsuhiro Ohtomo, it's a film that helped popularize anime culture in the West. It was nothing like we had seen before, being aimed solely at the adults, containing graphic sexual references, disturbing and gory images, heavy themes and more violence than any two Hollywood action blockbusters put together. It's also a thoughtful story and analogy about a young man forced to grow up too quickly and being confronted with strange phenomena, feelings and powers he's not yet mature enough to understand, let alone control.So what's the story? Kaneda is young hooligan belonging to a motorcycle gang. They're enjoying their freedom and mischief, until one day his friend and fellow gang member Tetsuo happens upon a small child, who's much more than he seems. Tetsuo gets injured and happens to absorb some of the child's power. From there the eponymous Akira seizes control and lures Tetsuo into trying to free him. And from there it's a nonstop battle for the survival of Neo-Tokyo, Tetsuo's soul and everyone's lives. All told through phenomenal voice acting, alluring twists, great plot points and animation so vivid, gorgeous, detailed and vibrant that people have made completely valid arguments for this being the crowning achievement of animation.Furthermore, the score is very good. It's not what you would expect from a movie such as this, being more groovy and ethnic than the normal pop and electric tunes, but it fits. You're always a bit surprised by it, but after a few moments you'll start digging it.Akira is a masterpiece. If you can, do read the manga series beforehand, because it's well worth it and offers a deeper understanding of the material. But, if you can't, this movie will still win you over with its brazen style, high impact concepts, beauty and sheer energy.",Null,1,3,10 August 2014
Train to Busan," Exhilarating Day One zombie movie
","Train to Busan is a story about a group of random people that are on their way to Busan in South Korea when the zombie virus breaks loose and people start to turn. The movie is nothing more than their desperate struggle to survive through the initial onslaught and make it to safety. But it excels at just that, being nail-bitingly intense, legitimately scary and surprisingly touching on character level.First of all, the zombies are great. Full of props to the actors and the special effects team for their work, because not only were these zombies scary on a conceptual level - turning in an instant and being blindingly fast and strong - but they were also played superbly and looked horrifying.Secondly, the script is great. Day One zombie movies are often rather similar in their plots, and as such there's an art to doing it in a way that feels new and novel. And this movie certainly does that. I also really liked the characters and their interactions. Rarely have I cared as much about the survivors in a zombie film as I've cared about these people. Our nominal main characters, the father and daughter, and their character arcs were especially heart-wrenching.Lastly, the directing. Yeon Sang-ho has a superb grasp on when to rush the plot along and when to give us a moment to breathe. It's an intense movie where there's always danger and something happening, but we still have these moments to get to know our characters and come to care about them. Or hate them, depending. The worst threats in a zombie apocalypse are often the other survivors, after all.Fantastic film. One of the best zombie films I've seen in years. One of the best horror films in general, as well, for that matter. Recommended.",Null,0,1,1 April 2020
Citizen Kane," Giant of its field
","Any art becomes harder to appreciate as time passes. We look at statues and paintings from, lets say the Ancient Greece, and we appreciate them for their aesthetic, their style and the craftsmanship that went into making them. Yet we often know very little about why or even how they were made. Were they political in their time, like art often is nowadays, or were they made simply to feed the artist, like some of the greatest works of art in history have sometimes been made? And if we somehow found out that a painting of a human figure in some prehistoric cave was actually a political satire of the rival clan chief, would it add value to the work?I ponder this because I don't think I fully get Citizen Kane, or if I even can get it without a degree in history. Back in its days, the film was widely applauded for its groundbreaking style and its cinematographic feats. Orson Welles put himself on the map by pulling off tricks and visuals that had never been seen before. He also based the story of one Charles Foster Kane on a real life business tycoon William Randolph Hearst, a polarizing figure back then, thus tying the film to the days of its release.And I view this film and I must admit that it didn't blow me away. The cinematography is brilliant and impressive, but I've seen most of the tricks already in newer films, and thus their impact is lessened. And while it's an interesting character study about the meaning of contentment, wealth and American ideals, I was left with the impression that I was missing something. And I think it's that I have no real life parallels to compare this film to. Especially seeing as I'm not an American.Is it still a good film? Oh, definitely. It's a pioneer of its field, its themes are very deep, it's beautiful on the technical level and even the story, while rather slow, does keep you interested through the capturing presence of Welles' acting. I do recommend seeing it, though I must admit that I respect it more than I like it.",Null,3,4,8 June 2016
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," The darkest Star Wars movie so far
","Rogue One, detailing the story behind the theft of the original Death Star blueprints, was a pleasant surprise for me. It's the first major Star Wars film ever made that is not part of the original saga of trilogies and thus it was a bit unclear just what niche it was going to fill. And don't get me wrong, I like the plot for this movie. It was alluded back in the original Star Wars that there was a mission to steal the blueprints that eventually allowed Luke Skywalker to destroy the Death Star, so why not tell it. Plus, I'm not at all bothered by the fact that I already kind of knew how the film would end, like some complainers have been. It's like complaining about the fact that a Disney movie is going to have a happy ending no matter what.But still, it was a bit unclear just how much effort was going to be put into this, and luckily they didn't disappoint. I'd say that this is just as good as Force Awakens. It's instantly recognizable as Star Wars, broadens the universe and gives us exactly the kind of action adventure we want. The final battle especially, over and on the garden world of Scarif, is one of the best battle scenes we've yet seen in Star Wars. It's creative, easy to follow and filled to the brim with tension. It also contains one of the best Darth Vader moments in history. That alone was worth the price of admission, in my mind.The story is also very good. It's a lot darker than the trilogies, by which I mean that it's told as a war story. The Rebellion versus the Empire feels like a proper war, with both sides willing to commit atrocities in the name of their cause. There are casualties aplenty and people don't come out unscathed.The movie is not without its flaws, however. Jyn Erso (Felicity Jones), the main character, is unfortunately a bit flat, as is the main male character Diego Luna (Cassian Andor). Neither of them is terrible, but they're not all that identifiable either. The supporting cast is very strong, however, which makes up for this failing. I especially like the droid K-2SO, voiced by Alan Tudyk.Some have also complained about the fact that the first half of the movie drags a little bit, but personally I didn't notice.All in all Rogue One is more than a worthy addition to the Star Wars saga. If you liked Force Awakens, you're going to like this one just fine.",Null,2,4,8 February 2017
Captain Marvel," A good Marvel movie once again, although a bit lacking in identity
","Captain Marvel can be seen as a prequel to the whole Marvel Cinematic Universe. Even more so than the original Captain America film. It takes place a bit over a decade before the events of most of the others, introduces us to young Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) and shows us a world that has not yet experienced the weirdness of aliens invading New York or super geniuses flying over California in suits of armour.It also gives us the conflict between Krees and Skrulls. Krees we have seen before in the Guardians of the Galaxy movies, but this movie gives me an inkling that these two alien species will play a much bigger role in the post-Endgame Marvel universe. Which I don't mind, although I'm also not super hyped.It's also the very first MCU film with a female main character. About. Swearword. Time!And from a feminist point of view the film works very nicely. Carol Danvers (Brie Larson) is without a doubt the hero of her own story. She's powerful, confident and supremely capable, but she also feels relatable. I especially like her easy camaraderie with Nick Fury. These two click very nicely, but as colleagues, as two soldiers fighting for the same cause. More movies need something like that.I also like what they've done with the Skrulls and how their innate shapechanging abilities are played straight as something that would give anyone opposing them trouble.Plus it has the usual Marvel goodies. Phenomenal special effects, nice callbacks, witty dialogues, good jokes, plenty of great action. All that good stuff.That being said, I did find the film to be just a bit on the bland side. Especially in light of the recent years when Marvel movies have becomes such huge, outlandish things. Thor: Ragnarok and Black Panther come to mind. Compared to those two this film looks and feels downright suburban. The locations are not especially interesting, the visuals tend toward grey and it's a very by the numbers story with no great surprises or twists.Which could still work with the right hero - Ant-Man would work fine like this, I'd think - but not when it's your first female lead and when it's Carol Danvers to boot. She's one of the most powerful heroes in Marvel lineup and deserves a bombastic film worthy of her potential.Still, the film is good. It simply isn't as good as it perhaps should or could have been. Worthy of a watch even still, definitely.",Null,1,8,27 March 2019
This Is the End," Lackluster ode to douchebaggery
","This Is the End seems to be one of those comedy movies that believe idiots and arrogant assholes are funny. And granted, it manages to give more than valiant effort to support this claim. Most of its jokes are rather cringeworthy, but every now and then it will make you laugh.So what's the story? Jay Baruchel, playing himself, has come to Hollywood to meet his old buddy Seth Rogen. Seth decides that they should go to James Franco's housewarming party, but while there the apocalypse happens. Props for imaginative setting and idea if nothing else. We have seen these 'actors playing outrageous versions of themselves' films before, but never quite like this. It'd also be an easy guess to make that, taking place in the apocalypse, all these actors would play tough action hero versions of themselves, but actually no. The movie treats them as rather pathetic human beings, which is at times frustrating and at times funny.The film's biggest flaw for me was the fact that none of the character were at all likable. Sure this is intentional in order to create comedy, but it's still hard to watch a movie where your most honest reaction to pretty much anything would be to hit the characters with a sledgehammer. Jay Baruchel is not as bad as the others and his down to earth performance saves a lot, but it alone is not enough to pull this film from the pit.Still, in the end it's not a bad film. I'm sure it'd be outrageously funny if its kind of comedy is your thing. Furthermore, it's effects are surprisingly good for a comedy film, the plot is rather interesting and the characters feel like unique individuals. Not my personal cup of tea, so to speak, but I don't regret seeing it.",Null,3,7,15 May 2014
Iron Man 2," Sequel, though not as bad as it could have been
","My least favourite Iron Man film, and for a good reason. Whereas the first Iron Man film was a great origins film, this film had the burden of answering the question 'then what?'. And it drops the ball, completely.Well, okay, perhaps that's not exactly fair. It's not a bad film, no sir. For one, the villain (played by Mickey Rourke) is very good. Rourke is a great actor, though he has a tendency to always play the exact some role of a grizzly badass, and that doesn't change, but he always throws in a little variety to keep it interesting. Ivan Vanko in this film always has this look on his face, like he's internally grinning at you, because you fail to impress him. A man always in charge, even while in chains, frighteningly brilliant and at times even unstoppable. In short, an excellent villain.Furthermore, Robert Downey Jr. is still an amazing Tony Stark. His few opening scenes are pure gold, especially the hearing, and when he acts out the vulnerability of the character, I believe it. The problem here isn't the acting, it's the writing. I've enjoyed the fact that Tony Stark always fights villains that he has created himself. Likewise in this case, which is fine, but otherwise they took a huge step backwards with the character of Tony. And this is a common sequel mistake where the main character seems to have learned nothing from the events of the first film. Tony Stark in this film seems to recess back to that egoistical jerk that we saw at the beginning of the first film. Granted, they at least try to justify it by pointing out that Tony is the sort of man to do things like that, but it still feels wrong somehow. We expected more from you, Tony.And it doesn't help that the film tries to force in a subplot about Tony's dead father and all the usual clich√©s that go along with that storyline. It's tedious, it's boring, it's not needed and the film really should have focused on the villain and the newly-found responsibilities of being a superhero maintaining world peace. Not this unconvincing emotional busywork.This film has its ups and downs. I love the action, the visuals and the music. I like the villain very much and I like the returning actors. But the story just isn't that strong and the film lacks focus. If you're a fan of the superhero genre and you liked the first film, you're not going to hate this one. It's not great, like the original, but it's decent.",Null,1,5,24 August 2013
World War Z," Bland and boring, but has a nice ending
","A bafflingly incompetent film about the sudden outbreak of zombie apocalypse. Featuring Brad Pitt in a leading role, this film has decent production values and adds some new twists to the old zombie formula, but it's the storytelling that keeps it from being anything but a snorefest.The main problem is that the story has no cohesion. The locations switch between every scene, as Pitt's character travels across the world looking for the cure for the zombie disease. This is realistic in the sense that if a real pandemic got released, the solution would almost certainly have to be international. One lab comes up with one part of the solution, and so on. Yet an engaging story this would not make, so their solution is to have Pitt travel across the world, collecting these clues and solutions, causing the film to be jumpy and scattered. It's just a series of action sequences and spouted exposition dialogues.That being said, when the film finally calms down and stays in a single locations for a longer amount of time, the film's quality picks up instantly and we get our needed intense zombie scares. And the zombies in this films are actually rather good. They have enough traditional elements to feel genuine, but they have been upgraded with some clever twists that allow for some crazy visuals.Aside from that, Pitt is not a bad lead actor and as stated, the ending is genuinely interesting. It's just a shame that we had to wait so long for the film to turn good. As it is, this is a slightly below average popcorn flick with some redeeming qualities. If you're a hardcore zombie fan, you'll probably receive some enjoyment out of this. The rest of you, there are better movies out there.",Null,0,1,22 January 2014

I also really appreciate some of the science shown in the scenes taking place outside the ship. They're small touches, mostly, but they're something you don't see in every scifi film and show that at least someone behind the scenes had a working knowledge of physics involved with space, zero-gravity and vacuum.The cast is also strong. Chris Pratt and Jennifer Lawrence are both rising stars in Hollywood, and for a reason. Both give good, credible performances and more than easily carry the weight of the film on their shoulders. I also really like Michael Sheen's small role in the film. At least half of the film's heart revolves around his charismatic performance.And then the problematic part. The plot in and on itself is serviceable. It's not great, but it's executed well enough to make it work beyond its initial limitations. The problem is Chris Pratt's character, who ends up making some truly questionable choices in the course of the film. Choices that look really bad, not just on paper, but in reality as well. Choices that I can easily see as deal breakers for some people. Personally I do think that the film handles those choices with the needed gravitas and doesn't sugarcoat them in any way, which saves the film for me, but I can totally see someone not being so forgiving.And that's Passengers. It's extremely well-made scifi adventure romance with some nasty undercurrents. Proceed with caution, but also with an open mind.",Null,0,1,18 June 2017
The Hunger Games," A good adaptation
","I personally enjoyed this one, both as a regular moviegoer and as a person who has read the book. In my opinion this is surprisingly faithful adaptation, which manages to capture the essence of the original story yet still managing to stand on its own. Is it helpful to have read the book before the movie? Yes, as with most adaptations, but the movie does a good job providing us the backstory and exposition. Not perfectly, mind you, but I don't think that many people will be confused by the plot.That being said, the best part of this movie are the actors. It is rather rare to see a movie starring young adult actors, who are as talented as this bunch. Jennifer Lawrence especially shined as the main protagonist, Katniss Everdeen, managing to portray both her tough, survivalist attitude and her fear for her life. Easily the best performance in the film. Though I have to commend both Josh Hutcherson and Liam Hemsworth for their roles as Peeta Mellark and Gale Hawthorne, respectively.The movie isn't without flaws, unfortunately. The biggest problem is the shaky cam that every reviewer is sure to mention. Rationally I can realize that it was used to maintain the rating, but it was still a bit annoying from time to time, though one grew used to it after a while. The other problem that I had with this movie was that while it is a faithful adaptation and a good story in its own right, there was that final spark that was missing. It's a good movie, but not something that I will surely see again in the future.And that's this movie. It's good, but not great. Faithful to the source material and surely enjoyable to pretty much anyone, but not much more.",Null,1,5,30 March 2012
Zootopia," Strong message against prejudice
","It has been said, among a veritable plethora of other things, that this film contains the strongest statement Disney has ever made. And there is truth to that. Disney films always have a message, a moral, but quite often it is the simplest of things. Be brave, believe in yourself, dare to dream, wish upon a star. Okay, that last one not so much nowadays, but you get the idea. But this film steps upon a soapbox. Its message loud and clear: Prejudice is wrong. Racism is wrong. Hating without reason is wrong. And in the modern world that message will hopefully carry across the nations and cultures. Because, we live in a time of fusion, in a time where all the people are starting to unite under a single banner of humanity. But it's a rocky road ahead of us and it warms my heart to see an icon such as Disney taking a stance, declaring their allegiance.And it's simply a fantastic film on its own, even if you took the message out of the equation. The characters are some of the best I've ever seen. Judy Hopps is going to be one of the great role models for the current generation of kids. The first bunny to ever serve as a police officer, she neatly straddles all the fences. All kinds of minorities and sufferers can see themselves in her. Women, people of colour, the poor, the ones from rough neighbourhoods or from the country. The film is very good in not locking its allegory into a neatly contained square. Judy struggles because she's a bunny, but what that means can be seen in vastly different lights, depending on your own point of view.And then we have Nick Wilde, a hustler fox, who's conned into working with Judy to solve a missing mammals case. Nigh perfect voice acting from Jason Bateman - as well as from Ginnifer Goodwin, who plays Judy - and one of the best duos from Disney in living memory. These two work together so well and story-wise the mystery plot moves beautifully and contains a very good hustling undertone throughout.If I had to nitpick, I'd say that I did find the villain just the slightest bit disappointing. Recent Disney films have tended to have a surprise villain, whose identity as an antagonist we learn only near the end of the film. All the reveals have been at the very least decent so far, but I do miss the so called honest bad guys, if I'm being completely honest. They simply had more charm, more menace behind them.Still, Zootopia is a great film. One of the all-time classics. Kudos, Disney, kudos.",Null,0,4,22 August 2016
12 Monkeys," Terry Gilliam strikes gold
","Terry Gilliam has always been one of the most unique directors working in cinema. Originally of Monty Python fame, he moved on to direct his own feature films. He's known for his elaborate sets, crazy props, odd camera angles and his many, many, many fixations.So, when I say that I find this particular film, 12 Monkeys, to be his most mainstream film, keep in mind that it's still way out there. This film is an experience for all senses.The story goes that humanity has pretty much gone underground in the future, after an event known as the Army of 12 Monkeys happened and wiped out most of us with a virus. Both now some of our remaining scientists have cracked time travel and are about to send a man into the past to find a cure for this virus. The man chosen for this is a convict named James Cole, brilliantly played by Bruce Willis.12 Monkeys has a well-earned reputation as one of the better time travel movies out there. And for a good reason. To explain exactly why would involve heavy spoilers, but suffice to say that I really admire the cohesion the film has in regards to the time travel paradox. The ending is a beauty.Plus, it's a crazy-looking blast of oddball characters, highly memorable conversations, great acting moments and it's also a decent enough love story. After a fashion.Great movie. Surprisingly easy to follow, given that it was directed by Gilliam and involves heavy time travel elements, but it is what it is. Hadn't seen this in a while and was pleasantly surprised just how good it was. Recommended for each and all.",Null,0,0,12 November 2019
Rang De Basanti," About the lessons history teaches us
","A British documentary filmmaker gets denied her funding at the last minute. But she has already sacrificed so much for the film, believing strongly in it. It is after all based on a story left to her by her grandfather. So she packs her bags and travels to India to film the documentary even without the help of her studio. There she recruits a bunch of college students to play the key parts and slowly introduces them to the history of their own country, which they have so far dismissed as corrupted and beyond salvation.What I liked about this film the most is how it juggles its storytelling. We see the young rebels fighting for India's freedom, so in essence the film jumps between two timelines. But it's all channeled through the documentary. The college students play the characters and we're every now and then reminded that this is indeed a film. Which ties it all together very nicely.The acting is also topnotch. Aamir Khan is as great as always, but all the rest of the main actors are also superb, and varied in the characters they're portraying. This film speaks strongly for an inclusive and all-encompassing India, and it does it well.I was also surprised by the direction the plot takes. I cannot really speak about it without spoiling it, but suffice to say that the film takes a rather dramatic and even dark turn near the end of the second act. And it's a better film for it. Sure, there will be people that won't like it, believing that the film glorifies this kind of action, but I don't think the film makers intended it that way.Strong film and one of the better Hindi movies I've seen so far.",Null,0,0,17 December 2019
Shaun of the Dead," Surprisingly good zombie comedy
","Zombie apocalypse as joke material is really nothing new. In broad daylight the slow and mumbling undead are actually pretty pathetic sight as long as you don't let them get too close. I still don't think that the subject matter has ever been approached quite this way. Because when you really look at it, in Shaun of the Dead, the zombies aren't the source of the comedy, they're actually a credible threat to the everyday joes that inhabit this film. Rather most of the humour in this film stems from the sheer stupidity of mankind. Because let's face it, many of us wouldn't make it for a day if the gates of hell were to be opened. But there would be some individuals, who against all odds would survive through sheer dumb luck. And that's this film.The director, Edgar Wright, along with the two main actors, Simon Pegg and Nick Frost, would later go on to make Hot Fuzz, one of my favourite comedies of all time, and a lot of the same ideas show up in this film. The same bland non-interest in the face of danger, bizarre circumstances happening in the background and the absolutely brilliant interaction between Pegg and Frost are the saving graces of this film, along with the usual zombie jokes that you'd expect from a film like this.This isn't Hot Fuzz, however, though it's still rather good. What I think it misses are likable main characters. The main characters in this film are really, really urban and bland. They're so boring and so lost in their everyday lives, not to mention the zombie apocalypse, that it's hard to root for them. I found myself cheering for the zombies occasionally when some of the more obnoxious characters were killed. Whether or not this was intentional, I don't know, but it does the film no favours.That's my personal interests interfering with my viewing experience, though, because I've never really liked these kinds of characters that are so helpless and so socially awkward that even the local computer nerds pick on them. Some might find them hilarious, however, so I can't really call it a flaw of the film. It's just not something that appeals to me.Aside from that grievance, the film is very good. The plot twists are very unexpected, but in a good way, the action scenes are not bad and the story, while a bit weird in some parts, manages to work, for some incomprehensible reason. Any fan of zombie parody should definitely give this one a watch.",Null,1,3,10 December 2012
Argo," Proficient yet kind of boring
","One of the truths you'll face once you start reviewing stuff with any sort of regularity is the fact that the hardest thing to review is something that's utterly average. It's not particularly good, but you can't in good consciousness call it bad either. So what do you say about it? For me, that's Argo in a nutshell.Based on the 1979 Iran hostage crisis, it tells the story of American citizens trapped behind enemy lines once the Iranians seized control of the US embassy. And thus it's up to Tony Mendez (Ben Affleck), a CIA consultant, to come up with a plan to smuggle the Americans out of the country. What we end up getting is a pretty good heist film, with the usual genre clich√©s and traditions. We have the plan, the rehearsals, the characters, the double talk, the tight situations. Yet it all stays grounded, because this thing actually happened. There are no high-speed chases or glamorous nightclub visits or over the top villains.And that's kind of the problem. I'm not claiming that it should have any of those things, or that it's boring because it's trying to be realistic, but the fact still remains that not much happens on screen to capture our attention. The film actually starts very well with the storming of the embassy, but then we cut to Affleck's character and the film comes to a screeching halt as we spent what feels like hours just following this nondescript guy around as he tries to come up with a plan. And the plan itself is actually pretty interesting. I was getting kind of invested in this weird movie they were using as a cover. But then, just as it was becoming interesting, we cut back to the hiding Americans and we start the whole process of building up interest once again.I really feel that I do not belong to this film's target audience. Because it really is a good film. Academy Award for Best Picture kind of good. It's just that its way of telling the story and its willingness not to emphasize the story in any way leaves something to be desired if you're like me, a guy who watches films for escapism. And in the end that's what this review is all about. It's my two cents about whether you'll like this film or not if you're like me. And thus I can safely say that I don't think this film is bad, and I'd even recommend it if I knew someone to be into realistic thrillers, but I didn't particularly enjoy it nor would I watch it again.",Null,2,3,6 April 2014
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," Adventure unlike any other
","A movie doesn't have to change how we see the world. It doesn't have to be deeply philosophical and profound. It doesn't have to render us down to tears. It doesn't have to be depressing and real. If it can be, and if it can pull it off beautifully... great. But it doesn't have to in order to be a good movie.Take this movie, for instance. It's based on a amusement park ride, of all things. Disney decided to do a pirate film, when the subgenre was pretty much believed to be dead, buried and the earth salted. But they did it anyway. Someone out there had a story to tell and believed in it enough to sell it to others. And in the process they made the best adventure movie I've seen so far in my life. Everything this movie does is pure entertainment. It's a kid's dream come true. Pirates rule the Caribbean sea and every scurvy sailor out there is armed to teeth with cutlasses, crappy pistols and really bad rum. Men are steel, boats are wood and the black flag sends shivers down your spine.But what really elevates this above other adventure films has to be the production values. First of all, the visuals are amazing. You're transported instantly into the age of sails, and the designs hit that perfect pitch between fantastic, real and horror. Top marks for the effects team. Second are the actors. Johnny Depp is nowadays synonymous with his character Jack Sparrow, who has become THE icon of piracy, with his outrageous look, mumbling speech patterns and plans which cannot possibly work, except that they're so crazy that somehow they do. Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley play the two other main parts and they fit in like gloves as well.Special mention has to go to Klaus Badelt for his score. Instantly recognizable, iconic and fitting the mood of dark and threatening adventure perfectly. One of the movie soundtracks I find myself listening over and over again.I get why someone doesn't like this film. It just doesn't take itself all that seriously. But the thing is, if it did, it would be a lesser movie for it. The fun is in the adventure, in the fantasy. It's escapism at its finest. And I absolutely love I it. One of my favourite movies of all time and a journey I will take again and again for the rest of my life.",Null,1,2,5 November 2016
Beauty and the Beast," Tale as old as time
","Song as old as rhyme. In a way that's the perfect way to sum up this film. In many ways the magnum opus of the Disney Animation Studios. The first animated film to be nominated for an Academy Award in the Best Picture category, still considered to be one of the greatest films ever made, a classic beloved by children and adults alike, a timeless tale about hatred turned into love, love twisted into hatred, about redemption, determination, sacrifice and willpower. An all-around good film, easily one of my favourite Disney films, and one of my favourite films in general.You all know the story. You know Belle, Beast, Gaston, Lumi√®re, Cogsworth and Mrs. Potts. You know the songs, the castle, the quiet French village. You know about the rose and the mirror, about the curse. You've all seen this movie already. And if for some baffling reason you haven't, you probably still know how the story goes. So I'm not going to talk about that. It's a great story, one of the best. That's all you need to know.Instead, let me talk about what this movie has taught me. Belle taught me about being different, about being the odd one in a crowd. She taught me that it's okay to read, to dream, to stand up against the opinion of the many. Beast taught me about the importance of what's inside. He taught me that no matter who we are or what we look like or where we come from, it's what we do, how we act, how we treat others, that matters. Gaston taught me about the meaninglessness of public opinion. His popularity taught me that I had to make my own choices, that leaders are fallible, that good looks can hide twisted morals and empty souls. The servants of the castle taught me about loyalty. Maurice, Belle's father, taught me about not giving up. Belle and Beast together taught me about love. Their romance is considered to be one of Disney's finest for a reason.Beauty and the Beast, to me, is one of those perfect films. Yes, you can nitpick and say, for example, that the CGI effects have aged a little bit in certain scenes. But what truly matters is the quality of the story. And I adore this story. It shaped me, as a child. It helped me grow into a better man, a better human being. And for that it has my eternal gratitude, respect and love.",Null,3,4,14 October 2015
The Babadook," The horrors of single parenthood meet the horrors of the supernatural
","Amelia (Essie Davis) is a single mother trying to raise her six-year-old son Samuel (Noah Wiseman) alone after her husband was killed in an accident. The only problem is that Samuel is a nervous, skittish and impressionable little boy who's constantly testing the patience of Amelie and all his caretakers. And things continue to go downhill when a mysterious book appears in Samuel's room, telling about a creepy Mr. Babadook, who will come a-knocking, after which he will naturally devour your soul, feast upon your blood, all that good stuff.Pretty much textbook as far monster horror movies go, but what gives The Babadook its strength is its way of telling its story and the things it chooses to focus upon. Because quite frankly Mr. Babadook is the least interesting thing in the film. The actual horror comes from the fraying relationship between the mother and the son, from the fact that they're both becoming so very scared of one another, and how you'll start to see their nerves building and building. It's a very poignant film about raising a child alone and being under so much pressure, stress and unreasonable expectations.And that leads to the downside of the film. It is a monster horror film and when Mr. Babadook enters the picture, the film just isn't as interesting anymore. I enjoyed the first half, when it looked like Samuel had simple gone insane and was lashing out against his mother, far more than I enjoyed the second half, which was by no means bad as far as horror films go, but which just wasn't as innovative and unique as the first half.Still, when the film works, it works amazingly well. Especially keeping in mind that this is director Jennifer Kent's debut film. Definitely worth a watch for all fans of psychological horror.",Null,0,2,7 December 2015
Knives Out," Old fashioned murder mystery with a twist
","Directed by Rian Johnson, Knives Out is a very stylish, very classical murder mystery. A whodunit story, following in the footsteps of Agatha Christie and other masters.This is most apparent in style and the visuals. The head of a family is dead and the family is gathering together to bury him and to settle such minor questions as inheritance and what really happened to grandfather. And obviously a gentleman detective just happens to turn up, ready to help. A premise straight from a Christie book. And the manour itself is also gloriously weird, filled with odd angles, bizarre knickknacks, scary mementos and enough Baroque aesthetic to make you fear the dark.However, while it is clear Johnson obviously loves this genre and wants to do it justice, he's not content simply rehashing old tropes and doing them correctly. He wants to take the genre forward, do something different with it. Innovate. And he succeeds. The film can be called a whodunit, but that's not entirely accurate, at least not the whole way through. Can't really say more about that without spoilers, but suffice to say the film has a few surprises in store for you.It's also brilliantly acted, benefiting from an ensemble cast of actors. A couple who stand out are Daniel Craig as the gentleman detective Benoit Blanc and Ana de Armas as Marta Cabrera, nurse of the late head of family and the supposed main character of the film. But all the actors are great. True, there are a couple of characters that don't get much screen time, making them rather one note, but that's the price of telling the story, I suppose.Knives Out is what happens when someone takes something he really loves, but not so much that he's unwilling to see it change. Rather he loves it so much that he wants to make it even better. And that's when the magic happens.",Null,0,2,12 January 2020
Oldboy," Stylish human suffering
","Dae-su Oh (Min-sik Choi) has spent fifteen years imprisoned within a highly guarded motel room. He doesn't know where he is, why he has been imprisoned, or even by whom. All he has are dumplings to eat, television to watch and nothing but time to spend. And suddenly, one day, he gets released and told that he has a short amount of time to figure out why he lost fifteen years of his life.From that intriguing setting we end up getting one of the best thrillers ever made. Directed by South Korean Chan-wook Park, Oldeuboi is perhaps the best film he has made to date. And this film truly shines because of its director. The story, based on a manga series of the same name, is iron tight and translated to the silverscreen very well. Park utilizes camera angles, lighting and colours with a master's hand and the film looks phenomenal. Long shots without cuts are used when needed, the whole film has a very stylish neo-noir look to it and it's also paced so that you're always held at the edge of your seat. It provides just enough information to keep you satisfied, but it's only at the end when all is revealed, and that ending twist is perhaps the best I've ever witnessed. Horrifying, sick and yet logical all at the same time.Min-sik Choi is also a very strong leading actor. He ranges from pathetic white collar loser to a hardened avenger without never missing a beat. It's also a very physical role to pull off, as he has to go from an overweight office worker to a man who has spent fifteen years with nothing else to do but work out. And yet he does it seemingly effortlessly.It's rather hard to talk more about this film without spoiling everything, but trust me when I say it's worth a watch. Personally I'd raise this to my personal Top 20. It's that good.",Null,1,4,28 July 2014
The Secret in Their Eyes," Competent crime film

The case concerns a murdered young woman and all the legal hoops they had to jump through in pursuing a conviction and all the corruption that stood in their way.Ricardo Dar√≠n plays the lead role here. He was also my favourite in another Argentinian film, Wild Tales, which I really enjoyed, and he's also my favourite in this film. Something about his whole being is just perfect to convey the frustration and sadness his character has to go through in fighting the windmills that are the Argentinian government and its legal system.As for the story, it was competent and very much enjoyable, but I also felt that it lacked that certain something. The end twist I could see coming miles away and the rest of the events, while competently filmed and certainly professionally made all around, were not what I'd call original.Not to say that originality is the end and all of film making - although it usually doesn't hurt. You can tell a classic tale and your film will be a classic as well, if you just tell it well enough. But here I didn't find that personal touch that I'm looking for.Still, the film is very good. If you're looking for a crime film with a film-noir feel and twist, you should definitely keep this one in mind.",Null,1,1,11 August 2018
The Irishman," Martin Scorsese indulges himself a bit too much
","The Irishman sees Martin Scorsese, Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci reunited to film yet another epic gangster film. This time with the addition of Al Pacino.And these are great actors and a great director. Which means that there's bound to be some really good scenes in the film. And there are. Whenever any of the three actors share screen time, it has that awe to it. The rest of the cast is pretty forgettable, on the other hand, and even with such powerhouse actors, you need a good story to really prop them up.Which is unfortunately the greatest failing of this film. Clocking in at three and a half hours, it's one of the longest films I've seen in years. And I have nothing against long films per se. Once Upon a Time in America, another gangster film of epic length, is one of my all-time favourite movies. But you need to keep it moving. You need to keep the story evolving. But in this film we learn the overall moral very early on. We learn the eventual fates of its key players very early on. So it's just a simple matter of going from dot to dot, until we get to the end. Which just about kills all the tension there is to be had.Martin Scorsese obviously wanted to talk about growing old. He wanted to talk about looking back and regretting the choices you have made in your life, the paths you didn't take. And putting such a theme into a gangster film is not a bad idea. Especially when the one to do so is one of the acknowledged masters of the genre. Unfortunately, in this instance, I think we could have gotten a better movie out of these characters if we had kept the whole 'growing old sucks, guys' stuff out of it.Still, there are a lot of people that rave about this film. So I guess it must hit some notes with them that it simply didn't with me. And it has some really impressive stuff in it, I freely admit that. They just didn't come together for me.

The Fifth Element," Master class in creativity
","The Fifth Element shines in its execution. The story itself is riddled with clich√©s, tired and old as time itself and it doesn't make the least amount of sense. And yet it's a ton of fun to watch and feels brand new, because of the talents of its makers.It's a film that feels like a classic. It has that feel of uniqueness to it, like it knows exactly what it's doing, even if it's completely random. And sure, it uses the technique of throwing every single weird and random thing at the screen and watching what will stick. But the thing is, most of it does stick. Everything from the weird weapon designs to clothing to random little details like a yard long list of weapon proficiencies to the whole mythos of the fifth element.It's also features some real acting talent in Bruce Willis and Gary Oldman, both hamming it up to eleven, Oldman especially, and having the time of their lives. Milla Jovovich as Leeloo is not in their league, truth be told, but she plays a delightful oddball with suitable skill to convince and intrigue.The rest you really need to go and experience yourself. It's a thrilling, never-stopping ride of adventures, science fiction gizmos, unhinged humour, cool visuals and special effects, bizarre characters and even more bizarre circumstances and so much more. One of the most enjoyable scifi films ever made and well worth it.",Null,1,3,27 August 2014
Batman Returns," At times silly, at times Gothic, at times dark and gripping
","You can see a lot of Tim Burton in this film, for better and for worse. His trademark Gothic style is heavily presented in the design of Gotham City and its various occupants, most of which are either tormented and dark heroes or complete monsters trying to pass as normal citizens. Unfortunately Burton's flair for over the top character is also present, which at times makes it hard to take this film seriously. The Penguin (Danny DeVito) is probably the biggest offender in this regard. Some of his scenes are downright terrifying, with him wobbling around and acting more like a wild beast than a man. But then he wobbles some more, this time clad in nothing but his dirty pyjamas, and the illusion of terror shatters almost instantly. The same applies to his dialogue. It's an odd mix of silliness and threat that either works brilliantly or utterly fails, there's very little middle ground with this character.This same ambivalence is present in almost all of the characters, with the exception of Batman (Michael Keaton), although he has his own flaws as well, the biggest being that he's not really the focus of the film. This film is more about the Penguin and the Catwoman (Michelle Pfeiffer). Batman is just there to move the plot along, which makes him rather uninteresting, which is a cardinal offence in my books, as this is a Batman film after all.All that being said, the plot of this film isn't that bad. Batman: The Animated Series once did an episode about the Penguin trying to join the normal, civilized society, trying to combat his inner weirdness and the prejudice of the common folk, who fear his odd appearance and animalistic themes. That episode really worked in my opinion and why not, as it is a very good idea for this particular character. The Penguin, like so many other Batman villains, is all about duality - in his case about the battle between his noble heritage and his savage upbringing, which makes for a great tragedy. And while the movie doesn't explore these themes as well as it perhaps could have, it touches upon many of them and at least makes the effort to try.Still, I just can't get past all those silly scenes where the previous Gothic mood completely shatters and the whole process starts all over again with the next scene. If you're a fan of Burton or Batman, you should give this one a try as it is a rather touching film and good one in its own way, but if you can't deal with sudden mood changes and a certain level of random silliness, this movie really isn't for you.",Null,0,0,3 September 2012
Finding Nemo," Under the sea... they have parenting problems as well
","A morose and neurotic clownfish named Marlin is raising his son Nemo alone after a barracuda ate his wife and all the rest of his children. (Trust me, it's a family film.) But then Nemo gets taken by Man, that great monster from the above world. And so Marlin has to go and find him. And we have our movie.I remember seeing this film when it came out and thinking that Pixar had really upped their game. Monsters, Inc. looked nothing compared to this and it's only a couple years older. All the locations underwater are breathtakingly beautiful, even today. Bursting with colour and life, hiding all sorts little details, nooks and crannies. And the fishes look great as well. There's a subtle scale detail on Marlin and Nemo that you only see in close-ups, but it's that extra layer of detail that completely sells it.True, the human characters are still a bit wonky, but even they have improved a lot from Monsters, Inc.Unfortunately, what keeps this film from being one of Pixar's all time greats, is the fact that the characters are not as good as they have been up to this point. Marlin especially is an aggravating character with his constant whining and scaredy cat antics. Yes, it's understandable and sympathetic to a point, and he does learn, but it's played up just a bit too much.Nemo is also a bit underdeveloped, but luckily the film has good characters as well. Chief amongst them being Dory, who's a bit of a one-joke character, but somehow the design, the jokes themselves and the voice acting by Ellen DeGeneres make it work beautifully.Finding Nemo is quality entertainment, don't get me wrong. It only pales in comparison to other Pixar films, and even amongst them it's up there. Definitely worth a watch for kids and adults alike.",Null,0,0,4 January 2019

Adonis is trying to become a boxer just like his father and recruits Rocky as a trainer in the ultimate bid for championship.Creed is an excellent example on how being formulaic is not necessarily a bad thing. The story in this film is textbook perfect sports film story. It's quintessentially Rocky in a way that's so blatant as to be utterly charming. And it works. The director, the screenwriter, the actors, they all believe in this story, in this franchise, and it shows in their work. Rocky has always been all about heart and it warms me to see a film such as this being made in modern times. It tells me that people still believe in the right things.I also like that they didn't try to reboot the series with Adonis. He is not meant to replace Rocky. Including this one, there have been seven Rocky movies so far, and they have built their own mythos, their own unique character cast. The story of Adonis builds on top of Rocky and Apollo, but it remains its own things.What can I say, it's a great movie and worthy of the name of Rocky.",Null,1,1,25 January 2018
The Great Dictator," End of an era, in more ways than one
","Charlie Chaplin was one of the great masters of the silent film. Even though Hollywood had moved to talkies in the late 20s, it would take Chaplin almost two decades to do the same with this film. The Great Dictator was filmed as a criticism against the oppression of the Jews rampant in Germany at the time. Chaplin plays a dual role as both Adenoid Hynkel, the megalomaniac dictator of the proud nation of Tomainia, and as a Jewish barber who lost his memory during World War One, and who's return home is soured by the marching stormtroopers.The film was a huge hit upon its release. And why not. If nothing else, it's brilliant propaganda against the onslaught of Nazism. That being said, I'm not personally all that impressed by it.The biggest problem I see with the film is the fact that Chaplin is still so clearly tied to his roots in silent film. The film is more of a collection of sketches than a proper story. Many of these sketches have no dialogue, being nothing more than an excuse for Chaplin to prance around, showing off his athletic skills and funny expressions.Not to say there's no content or depth to be found. The film's message against oppression is a strong one and whenever the film takes time out of Chaplin's prancing to tell a story, it tells it well. And the final speech at the end given by the barber is very powerful, speaking of hope and the triumph of good will over evil.If only the rest of the film could have been like that.But that the biggest flaw with Chaplin. His movies are rather alike and he's very fond of his tricks and mannerisms. The Great Dictator is an important film historically, but as a modern cinema experience it leaves a lot to be desired.",Null,0,1,13 January 2019
Hot Fuzz," Emmerdale meets Looney Tunes
","Simon Pegg and Nick Frost are one of the most brilliant comedic duos of our time. And nowhere is this more abundantly clear than in this film, their greatest comedy to date.Almost superhuman London police officer Nicholas (Pegg) is somewhat forced to move to a small rural town where he meets up with its various inhabitants, one of them being an ineffectual local cop (Frost), who happens to be the son of the local chief of police. And thus a man used to the high octane action of London crime scene is forced to attend tea parties and to solve crimes such as rampant swans terrorizing the local fields.But then people start dying, seemingly by accident.What makes this such an effective comedy is first of all the comedic capabilities of its two main leads, but also how quick it is. Every scene has a joke, often multiple, and almost all of them are bullseyes. It's also very British in that the characters themselves don't seem to be in on the jokes. Most of them take the hilarity very straight-faced, which paradoxically makes it all the more hilarious.The film is also not afraid to go over the top and often, but in an intelligent way. The jokes don't pander to the lowest common denominator and the plot itself is more of a thriller mystery than your typical 'let's put silly people into silly situations' comedy plot. The final climax is even a straight up action sequence, though of course suitably over the top one.Hot Fuzz is one of the best comedies I've seen because it treats its viewers with respect. It's quick with a joke, but equally quick with character development and multilayered plot. Definitely worth a watch.",Null,0,0,28 June 2015
The Mummy," Indiana Joned with a more tongue in cheek tone
","Let's face it. No one's going to claim this is a good movie. Its plot is clich√©d, the characters are stereotypes - and quite often racially insensitive - the villain is one-dimensional and the acting can be hokey. But let's also not forget that it's fun. It's tremendous fun!And that comes largely from the fact that the movie knows it had no chance of being great. So it takes its premise and runs with it. It has fun along the way and that translates to the audience as well. You can clearly see that the actors are enjoying making this film, so why not join in on the fun.The end result is an enjoyable romp through Egyptian deserts, tombs and bazaars. Plus, the special effects have aged surprisingly well. The Mummy is obviously CG, but in a way that blends well with the colourful set designs.I hadn't seen this film in years, but I still enjoyed it immensely even in this modern day. It's a classic 90s adventure film and well worth a watch.",Null,1,1,19 June 2017
Constantine," Hollywood, I blame you
","The character of John Constantine was born from the pens of Alan Moore, Steve Bissette, and John Totleben. He was originally a side character in The Swamp Thing comics, but very quickly moved to his own adventures in Hellblazer. He's the epitome of a blue collar mage, getting by with the skin of his teeth, some guile and a boat load of punk attitude.The character has numerous problems. He's arrogant, not very strong magically, has a bad habit of getting his friends killed while saving his own hide, is very much rage against the gates of heaven kind of punk and is always biting off way more than he can chew. And that's why we love him. But that's not exactly something that you can make a Hollywood movie out of. So when they announced they were going to try anyways, I was suitably nervous. And for a reason.I mean, if you don't take into account that it's a Hellblazer movie, it's by most definitions fine. Keanu Reeves easily pulls off the detached arrogance needed, the special effects are nice, the storyline, while a bit high-flying, is definitely interesting and the whole one man against all the forces of hell slash occult style the film has going for it is very cool indeed.But, it's a Hellblazer adaptation and as such it fails miserably. I mean, the character of John Constantine is a blond, atheist/agnostic, British barely-a-mage with a real problem with firearms. Reeve's character is a dark-haired Catholic living in New York, with huge magical talent and more than filling to pump someone full of lead. And Chas, originally a middle-aged, unhappily married childhood friend of John's, with absolutely zero interest in magic, has been turned into teenage wanna-be apprentice of his. Tell me that's there's nothing wrong with the picture painted here. I dare you.By all means, do see the film if you're into all that Catholic exorcism style of fantasy. It's very good in that regard. But, if you love Hellblazer and the character of John Constantine, I'd steer clear.",Null,1,3,6 June 2016
The Others," A proper scary tale of mystery
","World War II has just ended and a young woman with two children is waiting on an island in the British Channel for her husband to return home. Her housekeepers have mysteriously vanished without any hints and thus she's forced to hire new staff, three solemn locals who claim a past with the manor they're living in. And then the strange sounds start plaguing the family.The Others works as a horror film because it allows the atmosphere to build. There are very few jump scares, almost none at all, and most of the horror is build on the fact that the mother is slowly losing her mind and is forced to doubt her every decision. The situation itself is strange enough with a lone manor, two children being forced to live indoors for fear of the light and three closemouthed locals, but then the facts start revealing themselves and it ended up being quite different from what I'd imagined. But in the best way possible. It's a well-spun tale all around.Two special mentions for extra greatness. First to Nicole Kidman, whose acting abilities are still very much on top. Hers is the carrying performance of this entire film and she sells it flawlessly. From a stern although caring mother to a determined mistress of a manor to a scared soul trembling in the face of the unknown. The second mention goes to the soundtrack, which is a perfect blend of classical haunting and British pastoral music reminiscent of the good old days of the Empire. Definitely a soundtrack I would listen just because. And I in fact have.The Others is a very good horror film. One of the best I've seen in years and definitely a film worth checking out if you're looking for something a bit more psychological and mood-dependent.",Null,3,3,19 January 2017
Rise of the Guardians," Fantastic characters, so-and-so storytelling
","I adore these stories where all myths are true at the same time, inhabiting the same world and mythos. In this particular instance, all your childhood stories are real, from Santa Claus to Tooth Fairy, from Easter Bunny to our protagonist, Jack Frost. Unfortunately, the darker sides of our childhood stories are also real.I also like that they didn't make these characters be in any way generic. Santa is still very recognizably Santa, but he has a Russian accent, swings around swords and has the words Naughty and Nice tattooed on his forearms. I mean, kudos for originality. The same applies to all the characters, with the possible exception of Jack Frost, but he is the audience surrogate in any case so it makes sense not to make him too exotic.The animation is also fluid, looks suitably festive, keeping with the theme of holidays, and has a great sense of movement and energy. It has aged perhaps a little bit since then, but not by much and the overall design is such that it can withstand time.What keeps the film from being a truly great holiday classic is the fact that the story is a jumbled mess. The beginning and the introduction to the idea is done well enough, but then the film cannot keep it together. We have no idea who the villain is, no idea what he is doing to reduce the power of the eponymous Guardians, what it even means when he captures one of the good guys, and so on. Things happen on the screen, but they have no reason or rhythm behind them. Perhaps the original novel, The Guardians of Childhood by William Joyce, explains it better, but if it does, the movie totally fails in conveying that to its viewers.Still, it's an enjoyable movie. Aggravatingly vague in its world-building, but enjoyable nonetheless.",Null,0,0,4 January 2019
Rise of the Guardians," Pure family entertainment
","I was hooked from the moment I saw the trailers with crisp and colourful images, Santa with a Slavic accent and an Easter Bunny voiced by Hugh Jackman. That's a recipe for success and the movie doesn't disappoint. It's very solid film from Dreamworks Animation, losing just slightly to Kung Fu Panda and How to Train Your Dragon.What I liked the most are the characters. Santa is easily my favourite with his booming voice, his accent, his tattoos and he's workshop full of yetis. But the rest are equally as entertaining, each with their own quirks and personalities. Though personality-wise the character of Sandman is something of a disappointment, mostly because he has no dialogue, and the film fails to convey him through his expressions and little sand images. He has his moments, but he gets lost in the background while the rest of the character talk with each other.The other slight disappointment was the villain, Pitch (Jude Law), who was just so smarmy and clich√©d with his drawling speeches and megalomaniac posing. At least he avoids the worst pit fall by having a motivation for his actions against the Guardians. Granted, the motivation isn't the most exciting ever, but it works in a pinch. Still, the character just isn't unique enough to fully satisfy the viewers. Especially when the Guardians, with the exception of Sandman, are such unique versions of their fairytale origins. Santa has tattoos, Easter Bunny is a badass warrior, Tooth Fairy is a hummingbird... while the villain is just a dark man in a cape. You can see the problem here, right? The protagonist, Jack Frost (Chris Pine), isn't quite on par with the rest of the Guardians as far as uniqueness goes, but he is given a lot more backstory, and he's the audience surrogate in any case. While I do think that some of that backstory was slightly clich√©d and overly sentimental, I can't deny that it doesn't do its job. Jack is a good character and you sympathize with his problems and can thus understand when he falters and struggles. Plus he's just plain fun to watch.On the technical side of things, this film looks amazing. The textures are amazingly detailed, the backgrounds look awesome, the locations are entertaining to observe and study, the character designs fit the characters' personalities and are equally intriguing. Everything moves with smooth grace, which makes the film very easy to follow and enjoy.As a whole this is a great film from Dreamworks. It isn't their greatest movie to date, but it's up there with the best. It's a good family adventure, while being mature and wise enough to appeal to adults just as well. Entertainment in its greatest form.",Null,0,1,22 December 2012
Home Alone," Oozing with Christmas
","A movie that very much came to define the decade it started. Home Alone is a cheesy, lighthearted, popcorny action-comedy-drama. And a really good Christmas movie to boot. Kinda like Die Hard.We all know the story, I trust. Kid gets left behind during the holidays and then has to defend his house against a couple of bumbling burglars. Traps are involved. Traps to make the Looney Tunes proud.And it works, it really works. But I would argue that the reason this film has stayed with people and the reason we still watch it, is because the director Chris Columbus injected in so much Christmas spirit that you'll be stuffed to the brim with it. This is a colourful movie with beautiful sets and enough Christmas lights to provide for an international airfield. It has Christmas songs, Christmas classics on TV. It has a great tree, great morals, and it's just to very Christmassy.At the center of this is Kevin, played by Macaulay Culkin. A wide-eyes, precocious little brat that manages to pull off the almost impossible feat of acting realistically childlike - you know, like a sociopathic, greedy little monster - but still coming off as sympathetic. And sure, in his heart he's a good kid, but the reason we like him is because he's so cheerfully blood hungry. And because he honestly and purely loves Christmas.Is it an odd movie when you think about it? Yeah, a bit. Is it a bit painful to watch all those traps as an adult with a working knowledge of physics? Yes, oh very much so. Is it still a ton of fun? Absolutely.",Null,1,1,8 January 2019
Spotlight," The struggles, responsibilities and occasional victories of journalism
","Spotlight centers around eponymous investigative journalism team working for The Boston Globe, which in the early 00s revealed an ongoing campaign of cover-ups by the Catholic Church, aimed to keep the scandal of sexual child abuse conducted by their priests hidden.It is an important moment in history, but where this movie truly shines is in its portrayal of journalism and the role it plays in our society. The movie is told almost purely from the point of view of the journalists. You could exchange the scandal for something else entirely and the movie would play out pretty much unchanged. Its purpose is not to mock or downplay religion, but rather shine a light on the importance of journalism and its capacity to uncover truths. Even those that we've agreed as a society to keep hidden.An important film and an important story, but also a really well-made film as a whole. The acting is topnotch, as is the script. Visually the film is the very opposite of flashy, but this does not in any way hinder the film. Quite the opposite. The subject matter in question demands a serious and solemn approach. It demands the clinical touch of realism. The discussions and the issues have to be on the forefront instead of creative camera movements and elaborate sets.Go watch the film and then at least consider getting a newspaper subscription, so that the journalists of the future can keep doing the good work that they do.",Null,0,0,5 August 2019
Aquaman," Colourful extravaganza
","In my mind Aquaman has the honour of being the second honestly good DC film after Wonder Woman. And once again it's due to it straying away from the usual DC/Zack Snyder/Christopher Nolan clich√É¬©s. This is a colourful action blast full of good humour, interesting locations, bright lights, majestic set pieces and enough eye candy to paint a house with. True, the story is still bit of a mess, it's trying to do perhaps a thing or two too many at once, but it's more than entertaining enough to rise above such petty concerns.Two great things to single out. First is the direction of James Wan. Mainly a horror director before this, he brings with him this great energy and passion. This feels like an epic. Like a great superhero film should. He also has a really good style when it comes to action scenes. Like in Wonder Woman, all the action scenes in this film are easy to follow, mostly shot at wide view, with very little shaky cam employed. And surprise of surprises, it makes it really entertaining to watch when you can actually see what's going on and can appreciate all the effort that went into making it.The second great thing is Jason Momoa as Arthur Curry, the eponymous Aquaman. Amazing physical presence, very good with action scenes and practically made for the role, despite his looks being rather far from the original character. And he has some serious comedic chops, which this character sorely needs. Because, let's face it, a superhero who talks to fish is not the easiest sell in the world, but Momoa makes it work.Granted, the villain side of things is still a bit lacking, the story is messy, some of the side characters are rather weak, and there are more than a few hiccups scattered throughout.But, the film still delivers. I walked out of the theater with a big smile on my face and I'd more than gladly see the film again. And that's the most important thing.",Null,3,5,28 January 2019
My Neighbor Totoro," I learned
","Sometimes, however rarely, it is possible to tell a story without an enemy, yet still have meaning, to tell something that matters. Something that changes those who hear it. Surely, all stories require conflict. Change, something happening, is conflict in and on itself, for change means that something has to go away, to die, even if it is just an idea of a moment. But conflict does not have to be an enemy.I learned that from My Neighbor Totoro.I also learned how to walk through a house yard, viewing it through the eyes of a child. I learned that tall grass can hide wondrous creatures and that it can be a pretty scary place. Overgrowing forests are a labyrinth, a place to get lost, but also to find something. Not all monsters have to be scary, even if they might look and sound like it. The spookiest grin might belong to the nicest person.Children believe in magic. For them dreaming is the same as the waking world. The older we grow the more we start to lose this truth, but as long as we're still children, we remember. If we're lucky, we realize, at some point in our lives, that dreams are important, for they are hope. And hope is the thing that allows us to step out of our doors. But often we realize this too late, if at all.Trees can grow overnight into mighty giants. And the oldest trees have power of their own. Empty houses are never truly empty. It's nice to have a roadside roof to hold the rain, though umbrellas are mighty useful as well. Laughter keeps thunder from being too scary, every old lady should be called a grandma and the reason no adult believes in trolls is because they can turn invisible.All this I learned from My Neighbor Totoro.",Null,1,2,9 September 2015
500 Days of Summer," Breath of fresh air in the romantic comedy scene
","'This is not a love story. This is a story about love.'That is the slogan for the film and it's very accurate. (500) Days of Summer is not a typical romantic comedy in that you can pretty much predict how it's going to end from the very first minute. It's cleverer than that, always keeping you guessing and not revealing its cards until it absolute has to. It would have been easy for this film to fall into a confusing mess and to be unbearable to watch because it tried to be too clever and unconventional. Luckily the writing here is razor sharp and director Marc Webb keeps the film admirably on course even when the plot jumps uncontrollably from one place or scene to another. But this jumping has a strategy behind it, and this is one of those non-chronological films where it doesn't feel convoluted or unnecessary to watch the scenes in the 'wrong' order.Huge props should also go the leading actor and actress. Joseph Gordon-Levitt plays a great everyman, a guy who has lost his way in life and is content just to go on, living his days one at a time. And then a woman walks into his life and what a woman Zooey Deschanel plays. She is perfect for this film's needs, naturally playing a girl that's charming and quirky enough that it's almost too easy to fall for her at first sight, yet you get the idea that she wouldn't be that good of a wife if you were to marry her.I also rather like the art style for this film. The director takes time to conduct small experiments with certain scenes, like he's still trying to find his own niche, and while this would usually make the film seem way too artsy, it works here, because there's still an undercurrent of effort. Different experiments feel like they have been thought through and instead of stealing focus away from the main storyline and the movie as a whole, they add to it. Very nice looking piece of film making in general.(500) Days of Summer is a film I'd recommend to anyone, who doesn't exactly like romantic comedies, but wants to give them a shot. It's quirky and unique enough that you won't get bored even if you think you've already seen all there's to see, yet it remains true to its genre enough that you get what you came looking for.",Null,1,2,13 January 2014
L.A. Confidential," Neo-noir perfection
","Los Angeles, 1950s. A big-time crime boss has ended up behind bars and now the criminal underworld is in turmoil, all the players vying for the top spot. Amidst all this we follow three members of the LAPD, as they all try to live their lives, do their jobs and perhaps even get somewhere in life.What I like the most about this film is its complexity and its willingness to push the genre. It's a neo-noir film, emulating the film noir thrillers of the early 20th century. And it works as a very good example of that genre. Everything from plot to characters to locations to atmosphere is at it should be. But then the film keeps adding to the pile. Especially when it comes to the three main characters. Take Russell Crowe's character, Bud, for example. At first he's a brute, nothing more. His police work hasn't bothered with the framework of the law in a long time and for him his job is an excuse to let out the rage bubbling within him. But then we dig deeper and find reasons for that rage, and suddenly it isn't so black-n-white anymore. Oh sure, he's still a brute, but in a way that we can understand, if not condone.This holds true for the other two as well. They all start out rather unlikable and unsympathetic. But the longer we follow them, the more we start to like them. And yet they never let go of those central traits we detested at first. If that's not good writing, I don't know what is.Great movie. Nail-biting and twisting plot with a heavy pulse. Fantastic characters played by A-list stars. Superb technicals helmed by a talented director. What's not to like?",Null,0,0,10 July 2018
The Jungle Book," One of the greatest
","The Jungle Book is one of the most well-known Disney films ever made and a very good example on how Disney excels when it comes to memorable characters and fantastic songs. Based on Rudyard Kipling's book of the same name, it tells the story of Mowgli, a small boy abandoned in the jungle and raised by wild wolves and various other jungle animals, including a panther, a bear and some vultures.What sets The Jungle Book apart from the other Disney films of the same era is the overall quality of all of its parts. Granted, the animation style is still a bit rough thanks to the Xerox method used to essentially copy and paste certain frames so as to cut corners. But it is a lot better than in the other films they made with it, plus the characters designs are a lot better than was the norm. The songs by the Sherman Brothers are some of the most memorable Disney has ever done and are only surpassed by those in Mary Poppins.Plus the story and the characters are a lot of fun, and the whole narrative flows absolutely without a hitch, depicting Mowgli's journey out of the jungle as they find out that Shere Khan, the tiger, is returning and is sure to kill any human he comes across.If I had to name one flaw, I'd say that the villain is something of a letdown in the end. At first he's great, and I totally understand why he's considered one of the strongest Disney villains. Plus it's great that he has something of a competitor in Kaa, the python. But the final confrontation with him and Mowgli was an extreme disappointment, not going to lie. Wham, bam, thank you, ma'am.But, aside from that, The Jungle Book is a great deal of fun.

Don Jon," Sometimes crude and vulgar, but always for a reason
","Don Jon is not what I would have expected Joseph Gordon-Levitt's directorial debut to be like. It tells the tale of a man deeply addicted to pornographic movies. So much so that even a million dollar babe like Scarlett Johansson can't fully satisfy his needs for sexual release. Sound vulgar and abrasive? It is, from time to time, but it's also a cutting social satire, a really good character study and a funny comedy, all wrapped into a delightful package of uncomfortableness.The best part of Don Jon are its main actors. Gordon-Levitt absolutely shines in the leading role. He captures it all. The cockiness, the charm, the uncertainty, the naiveness, the lust, the strength of character, the ideals, the idiocy. Jon feels like a real human. A strange one to be sure, but he has so many layers that you cannot help but feel like he's real. Like you could meet a dude like this at the gym or outside a nightclub.Scarlett Johansson and Julianne Moore also do credible job in portraying the two women in his life. They're polar opposites in many respects, but you can see what pulls him to them. And once again, they're both larger than life as well as real enough to please the human in us.Don Jon is not for those overly sensitive about social sensibilities. Its main themes are sex, porn, addictions, falseness of outward appearances and the masks we put on to fool both others as well as ourselves. It doesn't apologize for what it is, it doesn't shy away from anything. But if you can manage it, it's one of the funniest and most poignant social commentaries you've likely seen in a long time.",Null,1,1,5 April 2014
Deadpool 2," I think the studio got involved
","The first Deadpool was great. It was not the first superhero film rated R, despite what people claimed, but it was a breath of fresh air nonetheless. It was foulmouthed, uncompromising, gory beyond belief and aimed purely at adults. Immature adults, admittedly, but still adults.So, does the sequel hold up? Well, yes and no. It has several good things going for it, but at the same time it feels a lot safer, a lot more meticulous, a lot less pure in its approach.The good things first. Ryan Reynolds is still living his dream with this character and it shows. Deadpool might not be as unleashed as he was in the first film, but he's still a blast to be around and a constant source of laughs. In fact, the cast in general is very good in my opinion. Josh Brolin as Cable, especially. Intimidating, scary and a total badass, yet fitting in perfectly with the rest of the characters, who for the most part are more about quips and body part jokes.Though I will say that the movie did not have enough Domino (Zazie Beetz) in it. Huge missed opportunity. Hopefully she will return in the next film.The action scenes were also good, although lacking that flair seen in the original. The humour worked, the dialogues were fun and the plot was not bad.And yet it is the plot, or rather the story, that's the biggest problem. Mainly the fact that there's too much of it. And that's not usually something to complain about. But let's be honest here. We go into a Deadpool movie for the gore, for the fourth-wall breaking, for the adult humour, for the utter disregard for cinema conventions. And this thing has all of those, but nowhere near as much as the original. Instead it actually tries to make us care, to get emotionally invested. It succeeds, funnily enough, but it's still questionable that it even tried in the first place.So, is the film worth a watch? Sure, if you liked the first one. This will give you your fix, no problems. And who knows, perhaps you'll even like the fact that the Merc with the Mouth makes you have the feels.",Null,0,1,4 July 2018
X-Men," Hallmark movie
","X-Men can be said to be the movie that by itself launched the modern superhero film madness. There had been superhero movies before, some of them even somewhat successful, but this was the film that defined the new style. It paid homage to the comics, taking its inspiration from them, but it took liberties with its characters, story lines and most importantly the visuals, transforming and translating them to the silver screen.It also helped that it had an amazing ensemble cast behind its characters. Patrick Stewart, Ian McKellen and Halle Berry were already well-known by this point, but the film also helped to put several people on the map, most prominently Hugh Jackman. And their newfound fame is well-deserved as they all give fantastic performances, breathing life into their characters. Sure, some of their lines... okay, about half their lines were very cheesy, but that's the fault of the script which, while revolutionary in its own way, was still looking its way and thus contained a significant amount of silliness from the previous decades, which had made those previous films so hard to sell to the larger audiences.Another minor problem is the story. And don't get me wrong, I like the story. But right now, fifteen years and an impressive amount of superhero films later, I can say that it's a bit juvenile. And, to the film's credit, it shies away from pure black-n-white morality with its villain Magneto (McKellen), as well as it should, but overall the tone and the events don't reach that same magnitude and epicness that later movies would.In the end this makes X-Men very important for the whole superhero genre, but keeps it from being more than an average film. With some very impressive features.",Null,1,4,2 August 2015
Thor: Ragnarok," Good solid adventure, with some tone problems
","Chris Hemsworth is back as Thor, the crown prince and guardian of Asgard. The story picks up some time after the events of the last Thor film as well as those of Avengers: Age of Ultron. Thor is furiously searching through the realms, looking to prevent Ragnarok, the end of Realm Eternal, which he foresaw coming in Ultron. But then one of Asgard's oldest enemies, Hela, the goddess of death (Cate Blanchett), breaks loose from her prison.What this film has in abundance, apart from the usual Marvel goodies of great action, stunning visuals and all that good stuff, is style. It's a colourful, punk-futuristic blast of heavy metal, acid trips and far too much chrome. It's like watching one of those 70s acid music videos, except with great story, characters built upon by numerous previous films and a lore deep enough to encompass something even this weird and bizarre.We also get Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), who's always a welcome addition. And, this time we actually get to spend time with the big green guy. Usually it's about Bruce Banner trying to live with this curse of his and the green guy only comes out when it's time to fight. But this time we get more of Hulk, not Banner, which is a nice change.And as stated, there are the usual Marvel upsides. The visuals are phenomenal, the action scenes are enjoyable and returning characters are a lot of fun - with Loki (Tom Hiddleston) once again stealing the show.All that being said, I do have problems with the film. For one, I didn't much care for Blanchett's character. She's a great actress, but Hela was written as a pretty bland villain. Things didn't go her way and now she wants revenge. There is some good stuff when she's talking about her past with Odin, but it doesn't amount to much in the end. Though it is nice to hear more about the history of Asgard.But the far bigger problem this film has is that of tone. Specifically knowing when to make a joke and when to allow the scene to play out without the crutch of humour. Doctor Strange had this same problem where almost every badass scene, every scene of drama, every scene of any potential weight or depth, was capped with a quick quip or a visual gag or a one liner. But here it's far worse. Whenever I was starting to get into the mood, whenever anyone did anything noteworthy or cool, someone made a pratfall, or went flying through a window, or got his looks mocked by a bystander, or a piano crashed on his head, or something. Okay, not that last one, but I wouldn't have been surprised if that did happen. Disappointed, yes, but not surprised.Then again, I've heard this film's humour praised to high heavens, so perhaps it just wasn't my cup of tea. Nevertheless, I do think it's a problem that Marvel seems to be losing the courage to let scenes carry themselves. It's their thing to keep these movies lighthearted and fun, but if that is taken too far, the films loose their substance, their weight. The problem with DC films is that they're way too grimdark. Unfortunately with this film Marvel seems to be heading towards the opposite end of the spectrum. Which is equally bad.But, it was still an enjoyable watch and a good film. It's probably the most problematic film I've seen in the MCU, but that still means that it's merely a good film instead of a great one.",Null,0,5,23 December 2017
Match Point," Nontraditional and great because of it
","A Woody Allen film dealing with the meaning of wealth, the standards of living, lust and commitment. The story follows the live of a former tennis pro, Chris Wilton (Jonathan Rhys Meyers), as he gets to know a rich well-to-do Tom Hewett (Matthew Goode) and his sister Chloe (Emily Mortimer). Chris crawls into their lives and in no time at all Chloe is falling head over heels for him, even the father (Brian Cox) likes him and it'd seem that he is set for the rest of his life. And then complications occur as he meets Nola Rice (Scarlett Johansson), who just so happens to be Tom's intended.Typical setup, but the execution and how the story pans out is anything but. Usually these types of drama try to depict the protagonist as a sympathetic figure. The film usually condemns their actions and indecisions to a certain degree, but they're generally normal, nice guys. Chris on the other hand starts out like that. He seems a bit lazy and aimless at first, nothing out of ordinary, but as the movie progresses, he starts to change, to evolve, to fight for the way of living he has grown accustomed to. And it's an utterly fascinating process, the likes of which I have not seen before.Because in all honesty, aside from the story, this film is nothing new. The characters are fairly normal, though they are played by capable actors and especially the differences between Chloe and Nola are brilliantly portrayed by Johansson and Mortimer. One a seductress, one a nice sweetheart. The filming is topnotch, though nothing extravagant, but it's the story and especially the third act that elevates this film above its peers. I was all set to hate this film by the end of the second act, but then it started. Can't spoil it for you, but remember to see this film through before you judge it.To whom would I recommend this? If you have grown tired of love triangles, if you cannot stand them at all, see this film. It's still a love triangle, but in a way you've never seen before.",Null,1,1,18 January 2014
Children of Heaven," Approaches a fairy tale
","Children of Heaven is a story about a family in Iran. The son of the family, Ali (Amir Farrokh Hashemian), manages to lose his sister's pink shoes due to an honest mistake. Unfortunately their family is very poor and their father cannot afford new shoes. Which is why the two kids go out of their way to hide the fact the shoes have been lost, while searching for ways to get them back or to purchase new ones.It's a sweet story, no doubt about it. The two actors playing the children are very convincing and you definitely buy the sibling bond between them. I also like how humane they are. They act selfishly every now and then, but they also go to great lengths for their family in a way that feels real and believable.The film is also a fascinating glimpse into a culture. The Iranian life is displayed fully in front of your eyes, with all its quirks and oddities. This film is a fine example of why you should watch movies that are not made in your country or even in your cultural stratosphere.All that being said, the film is a bit of a slow burner. Especially the first act. Once you get into the groove of it and get used to how the story is told, it's fine, but the first half an hour or so feels like forever.Still, very good film. Sweet, innocent, optimistic and thoughtful. Recommended.",Null,0,0,16 December 2019
Zodiac," Lackluster and slow-paced
","The problem with crime movies based on true events is that there's rarely any coherent story arc to be found in the real world. There's always a beginning, certainly, sometimes even a sensible progression from one elemental plot point to another, and if we're lucky, there's even an ending. The thing that bothers Zodiac and so many other films is the fact that the opposite also holds true. Quite often crimes go unpunished. Sometimes we are left hanging in empty air, with no paths left to search and investigate. And that hanging is extremely frustrating and, in my opinion, doesn't make for a good story. A story is all about fiction. It's about forming a whole story, one that has something to tell to its viewers/listeners/observers. A story without a satisfying ending is rarely worth telling.And yet I wouldn't call Zodiac a bad movie, even though its ending leaves something to be desired. David Fincher is a talented director and I see in this film many of the same elements that made Se7en such a great film. The same gritty film noir style, the same hopeless determination that drives the protagonists forward, the same brutality in showing the murder victims. Unfortunately this movie lacks the extraordinary qualities of Se7en. The Zodiac killer is a shocking figure to be sure, but the movie portrays him as a stumbling character with luck on his side. There's no tension, drama or fear-filled awe to be found in him.It's a shame really. This movie had the potential to be great. The actors work, the directing work, the filming and editing work. All these individual aspects of a movie work. It's just the real-life story and its limitations that keep the movie back. Now it's just slow and at times rather boring film that leaves its viewers unsatisfied and disappointed. If you can deal with its limitations, this movie is a great piece of crime drama. If you can't... need I say any more.",Null,0,1,19 July 2012
The Prestige," A tale of misdirection, bitter rivalry and incapability to deal with loss
","What I've always admired about Christopher Nolan is his ability to make even the most extraordinary tales and people seem believable. Here we have a story about two stage magicians, set in the late 19th century - or possibly the early 20th - where they try to outdo each other with outlandish magic tricks and performances. Throw in some scifi elements, or at least storytelling aspects, near the end and you have a tale that's very out there. But it's told very close to earth, with identifiable characters, none of which is the outright villain or even the protagonist. The story is mainly told from Angier's (Hugh Jackman) perspective, but there are bits here and there that show us the viewpoint of Borden (Christian Bale), which keeps the story grounded and allow us to see that that neither of these men are completely right in their quest for revenge and recognition. One can of course argue in either direction, but the matter of the fact is that both of them were given the chance to stop, but they didn't take it, which allows the story to exist, yes, but which also makes it a bitter one.So that's one aspect that absolutely works. There are many more, such as the characters themselves, or perhaps I should say the main duo, Angier and Borden. The rest of the cast isn't bad - with Michael Caine being the everlasting beacon of solid performing - but Jackman and Bale are the main attraction of this film. They work off each other beautifully and they truly took these characters and ran with them.Add in some real twists and genuine surprises and you have one of those timeless stories in your hands. This is a story that could be told over and over again in many forms, and it'd still work. It has great themes, clearly defined acts and above all else it's captivating. Still, given the magician aspect, I believe that it works in the given time period perfectly and the late 19th century is showcased beautifully.So what doesn't work, you might ask? Well, most of it does work, but as I stated, there are some slight leanings towards science fiction near the end, which I thought were unneeded or at least distracting. They do allow for the story to reach its logical conclusion and give us some really disturbing scenes, but it's still weird to see such stuff in a film where there were none before. A deliberate choice in this case, true, but it doesn't come off as well as it should. Still, more of a matter of taste than a real flaw.All in all I really like this film. It's solid from start to finish, with great characters and even greater story. One of Nolan's better ones and that's saying something.",Null,0,0,16 April 2013
The Terminator," A cornerstone of science fiction films
","The Terminator had a large role in launching the careers of many of its makers, including Arnold Schwarzenegger and James Cameron. It has since become a beloved cult classic and the first film in a franchise that's still alive, kicking and doing well.So just what makes it work? What elevated this C-list dark scifi horror film above all that had come before? Well, having one of the best action stars of the century as your villain definitely helps. Even if this was one of his earliest roles. It was also the second film of James Cameron, one of the most acclaimed directors of his time. So there's a lot of talent behind it.But even though the film has been shot and directed really well, and even though Arnold is just about perfect for the role of an inhuman killer cyborg mercilessly hunting Sarah Connor, the mother of the future rebellion, I think the main thing that caught people's attention, is the story. The future has been overrun by robots and in a bid to end the human rebellion they send one of their own into the past to hunt down the mother of John Connor, the leader of the humans. That's such an imaginative concept that it instantly hooks you in, and after that it's pure 80s horror style and action.It also helps that the special effects are really good, especially for mid-80s. Sure you can spot when Arnold isn't really there, for example, but the effects would look pretty good even today and the dark aesthetic helps hide a lot of the crimes.One of the best movies to come out of the 80s and still one of the best scifi horror films ever made.",Null,1,2,13 January 2020
Hellboy II: The Golden Army," Now this is more like it
","The original Hellboy movie didn't really connect with me. It still doesn't. I've always felt that they spent too much time with the romance and the various side characters and not enough with the actual main hero, Hellboy. And thus I believe this, the sequel, to be the superior Hellboy movie. Granted, there's still not enough Hellboy in it, but at least the character count has been trimmed down and even the romance feels more real, for some reason. I don't really know what changed with the latter, but it just feels more believable.It's also a fascinating movie in that we get to see more of the world behind the veil as Hellboy - still played beautifully by Ron Perlman - and his team have to infiltrate the fey world and meet its various inhabitants in order to prevent global destruction by Prince Nuada (Luke Goss) and the eponymous Golden Army. And it's in this fey world that del Toro's vision truly shines. The troll market, for example, simply overflows with imaginative, unique and quite creepy creature designs, each more wondrous than the other. Then there's of course Johan Krauss, a German psychic inhabiting an empty diving suit, who joins Hellboy's team as its new leader. Great, wonderful design and excellent voice work from Seth MacFarlane.Still, the movie is not without its flaws. Hellboy still feels like a side character in his own movie. The script doesn't allow him enough room for us to really delve into his psyche or being. Part of this is poor writing, but there still exists the problem of there being way too many characters. Also, the main villain of the film is a bit weak. Prince Nuada belongs to this race of emo goth vampire elves... close enough. And yes, he looks absolutely ridiculous and follows the proud clich√© of being a whining 'my daddy never loved me' archetype. To Luke Goss's credit though, he does manage to instill at least a little bit menace into the role, but it's still a pretty poor showing.To sum it up, Hellboy II: The Golden Army is a mixed package. The visuals, the imagination and the creativity of it all are absolutely phenomenal. The returning characters have all improved, Johann Krauss is a fine addition to the mix and as a whole it's a decent fantasy adventure film. If only the script had been a bit stronger and the villain more original, this might have been just as good as Pan's Labyrinth.",Null,1,2,10 March 2014
Sleepy Hollow," Fun little action/horror flick
","How come that Christopher Walken has absolutely no speaking lines in this film, yet he's the best thing in it? All his character, the Headless Horseman, does is scream, stare at you creepily and then lop some heads off. That's it, but I'll be damned if he still wasn't the funniest, the most memorable and all around the best character in the entire film. But that's Christopher Walken for you. Only he can pull off such a feat without even making an effort.Not to say that the rest of the characters were bad or anything. Johnny Depp does a convincing job as Ichabod Crane, the rational detective sent to the countryside to investigate a mystery murder. Though I'll be honest and say that I never really saw the character. Rather I saw Depp playing his trademark quirky oddball character with slight variations. But in the case of this film, that works, so I have no complaints. The rest of the actors didn't leave any lasting impressions, but they were okay.But in all seriousness, the best part of this film, aside from Christopher Walken, is its production values. The film looks and sounds great. The costuming is topnotch, the cinematography works beautifully and all around it's a very impressive looking little film. This is a good thing, because the story itself is a bit too campy to be taken seriously, but the outlook of the film, aided by the performances of both Walken and Depp, allow you to relax early on and just enjoy the experience. I was more amused than bothered by the inconsistencies and questionable story twists, which were eventual and not as bad as they could have been.Do you require highly logical and consistent plot lines and characters to enjoy a film? Then this one isn't for you. Are you a fan of campy popcorn horror flicks with a good dose of self- and genre-awareness? Then this one is definitely for you.",Null,0,0,10 January 2014
Hotel Rwanda," Horrible, bloody war seen from the sidelines
","It's the spring of 1994. UN peacekeepers are about to pull back from Rwanda, a nation that used to be ruled by Belgium. Now the Belgians are gone, but they have left behind a divided people, having split the natives into two groups, Hutus and Tutsis. The Tutsis used to be in power, but now it's the Hutus that have the power. And some of them hate the Tutsis with a fiery passion.History has named this spring and its events the Rwandan genocide, so you can imagine it's not exactly a lighthearted, feel good movie. As the name implies, it focuses on a single hotel, run by Paul Rusesabagina (Don Cheadle), who took in hundreds of Tutsi civilians to shield them from the Hutu militia. The film is also known as the African Schindler's List for a reason.It's a fascinating true story, but it also means that we don't see much of the war and genocide happening outside the hotel grounds. We see glimpses and flashes here and there, but mostly this is a movie about what war is like for those that are close to it, but not directly involved. Which has its novelty, but it also means that you don't get that emotional impact you probably went in looking for.Then again, I have to admit it's brilliantly acted and all-around well-made. Cheadle especially gives a powerful performance. And the subject matter is heavy enough to carry the film, even if the focus is not on the heaviest possible aspect.Worth checking out if you have a thing for historical war drama and would like to expand your experiences outside the boundaries of Europe.",Null,0,0,4 January 2019
Ready Player One," High octane blast of pop culture
","Based on a novel of the same name by Ernest Cline and directed by Steven Spielberg. Ready Player One is the story of near future where humanity has escaped into a virtual reality called OASIS. The real world is not much to speak of, why would it be when all of us who should be maintaining it are spending all our days having adventures in a land of pure imagination.And if that isn't commentary, I don't know what is. And yet the film also acknowledges all the good things about OASIS. It is an awesome place, an alluring idea. The very first establishing shot, where we get explained what OASIS is all about, might be one of the most drool-worthy pieces of advertising I've ever seen. I mean, mountain climbing... with Batman. Sign me up!As for the story, it follows Wade Watts (Tye Sheridan), or Parzival as he is known in OASIS, who's one of many hunting for the final Easter Egg left behind by the creator of OASIS. This egg will give its founder full control over OASIS and its riches. Unfortunately, not all those looking for the Egg have the best of intentions.Very basic story, but that's the kind of world this is, and it fits in comfortably. I have no complaints. Sure, it's very by the numbers and predictable, but sometimes that isn't a problem. Sometimes you're more interested in having fun with something relaxing and familiar than having a completely new and novel experience.And familiar this film sure is. Spielberg is probably the only director on the planet that could have done this novel justice. Because the whole point of the story is that OASIS is a haven for all of humanity's pop culture. And I mean our world's pop culture. Not something made up, like a Rodent Man instead of Batman. So, if you want to make a movie about this, you have to get the rights to all these characters. And Spielberg did just that.That being said, while it is immensely cool to have the Iron Giant doing battle royale or to watch Parzival driving around in the DeLorean, the film is also pretty obnoxious in how it uses all these characters. For example, there's this one scene where our two main characters, Parzival and Art3mis (Olivia Cooke), are supposed to have a moment on the dance floor, but suddenly the film cuts to Tracer from Overwatch giving us a thumbs up. And that's not the only instance where something like that happens. Sure, you got Tracer. Good job. But story first, fan pandering second. Okay?Still, I really enjoyed this film. It's dumb fun, but there's nothing wrong with that and this is one of the greatest love letters to simple, pure entertainment I've ever seen. Definitely a must see film for all geeks, nerds, weirdos and lovers of genre culture.",Null,0,1,13 November 2019
The Hateful Eight," Tension, atmosphere and gore
","As a whole this film feels almost like a parody of a Tarantino film. But in a good way. It's definitely the one where he takes his directorial style the furthest, separating his normal mannerisms and segments clearly from one another, allowing us to enjoy them on their own, and making this feel almost like two films. The calm one at the start with nothing but conversations and character building, and the ultraviolent second one with blood, guts and gore spraying on the walls.It feels premeditated and a bit too clear cut for my personal tastes, but I cannot deny that it works. The first half of this film is intense, with a group of travellers getting trapped inside a mountain trading shop during a blizzard. One of them is a bounty hunter (Kurt Russell) escorting a prisoner (Jennifer Jason Leigh) to the next town over to be hanged. And all the rest of them are hiding secrets as well. Secrets which start to unravel as the night passes.It's a very dialogue-heavy movie, which is great because Tarantino has once again pulled in an ensemble cast. We haven't seen Russell in anything that significant in years, but he is one of the best actors in this film by a wide margin. Gruff, determined with a mean streak mile wide, but even wider code of ethics, jaded and grim though they are. Leigh is also a shining character, with an Oscar nomination well-earned. But it's Samuel L. Jackson playing another bounty hunter that once again steals the whole show. Every scene he's in is captivating, intense and frightening beyond belief.Pretty much the only real nitpick I have is that I kind of hope the story had played out a bit differently. The early talk about this movie had us believe that Tarantino was going to direct a classic closed room murder mystery, with one of the characters getting axed off and the rest of the film being the characters trying to find out who the murderer is. Now, that's close to what we end up getting, but still far enough that I cannot help but feel a little bit disappointed. Because can you imagine Quentin Tarantino directing a classic murder mystery straight out of Agatha Christie books. It would have been amazing.Nevertheless, it's a great film. Not one of Tarantino's best, but still heads and shoulders above its peers and well worth a watch for all fans of action, western and mystery.",Null,1,4,22 February 2016
The Adventures of Tintin," Thrilling adventure across the globe
","Based on the legendary comic albums by Herg√©, The Adventures of Tintin was an attempt by Steven Spielberg to bring the very European hero to the American audiences. And no better man to do it, since Spielberg himself has self-admittedly drawn a lot of influences from Tintin for Indiana Jones, for example.And what a fantastic film. Based on three of Herg√©'s albums: The Crab with the Golden Claws, The Secret of the Unicorn and Red Rackham's Treasure, it tells about a sunken treasure and clues to its location hidden within old artifacts, one which ends up in the hands of a young reporter, Tintin, pulling him into the plot. Along the way nefarious plots are uncovered, colourful (and occasionally hilariously foul-mouthed) characters are met, exotic locations are explored and all in the name of good fun, excitement and, above all, adventure. Picture perfect plot and the action supports it beautifully. It's exactly the same brand of thrills that made the Indiana Jones trilogy such an iconic adventure classic. Glad to see that Spielberg had at least one of these still left in him.He also gets the characters very well. Tintin (voiced by Jamie Bell) is exactly the same kind of pure hero in a fictive cape we've come to known from the comics. Daniel Craig as the villain is a lot of fun and captures the archetype of a cultured baddie beautifully. But my, and probably everyone's, favourite character is without doubt Captain Haddock (Andy Serkis), a drunken rot of a sailor, who still shines from within with past glory and a core of iron and timber.My only real gripe with the film is that I'm not a fan of the motion-capture style of animation utilized. All the backgrounds look great and allow for some really fantastic action segments, but the characters themselves teeter just on the brink of uncanny valley. Their faces are expressive and their motions have been captured well, allowing for some really good acting moments, but the skin textures are more than a little plasticky. Overall the quality of animation is good, but it could have been better.Nevertheless, The Adventures of Tintin is a great film. I really hope they make a sequel because this is easily a franchise equal to Indiana Jones in terms of potential.",Null,0,0,18 January 2016
Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid," A western with an upbeat sense of humour
","A movie starring Paul Newman and young Robert Redford, playing the eponymous outlaws, who operated in Wyoming during the final years of the Old West. They made a legend as the most successful train robbers of all time and as gentlemen who tried to avoid killing as much as possible. Of course the truth is a bit more jaded than this movie would have you believe, but even the real events were quite outlandish and almost like from a pulp novel.The movie is very much a western, no doubt about that, but for a western it's bit of an odd duck. That's because it actually has a sense of humour without being an outright comedy. Butch and Kid have very upbeat attitude when it comes to life and their chosen career and even during their toughest moments they have time to exchange banter and jokes about them being in trouble. Not that the movie cannot take itself seriously when it is called for, but overall the film has a lighthearted tone for a western. Which is nice, I have to admit.The score is also odd, to say the least. I'd even dare to call it ill-fitting, but it somehow manages to work. Just don't ask me how.The best thing about this movie is without a doubt the main duo. They're pure dynamite as actors, especially when sharing a screen. Because the film is based on real events, the actual plot is a bit episodic in nature, which is not an outright flaw, but I can only imagine what the film would have been like if they had taken these two characters and told a more coherent story with them. It would have been something unbelievable.Still, even as it is, the film is one of the better westerns I've seen in years and definitely worth a watch for all fans of the genre.",Null,1,3,4 December 2018
Moana," Once again solid effort from Disney
","With Moana Disney returns to its princess formula, albeit with a more adventurous plot and a noticeable lack of romance. Which is a good thing. Disney has tried to re-examine its own traditions ever since The Princess and the Frog, and this movie is a logical continuation of that. And it's still perfectly recognizable as Disney. It's about going on an adventure, finding yourself, believing in yourself, all that good stuff.It's also the best-looking film Disney has yet made. And that's saying something. The water effects utilized in this film are jaw-droppingly gorgeous. Someone joked that it would have been easier for Disney to go out and film real Polynesian waters. Because it looks so good I'm not convinced they didn't do just that. The rest of the textures, designs and visuals overall are almost equally as pleasing and it's simply a joy to watch.Also full props to the two leading voice actors and their characters in general. Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson continues to prove that he's one of the most likable persons on Earth, but the true star of this film has to be Auli'i Cravalho as Moana in her first ever film role. Her sheer singing talents would have made the character one of the best Disney heroines ever, but it's more than that. It's the will of the character, the passion mixed with fear of the unknown, tempered by fierce will to protect her people. And all this wrapped inside compassion and goodwill. Auli'i easily made Moana one of my all-time favourite Disney characters.Probably the only real complaint I have about the film is the story. Because while it's perfectly fine, it could have been better. At times you get this nasty feeling like you're being manipulated. Like certain scenes are there just because it's a Disney film, not because the film itself needs them. The film also makes fun of Disney's own clich√©s a bit too mean-spiritedly in my opinion.That being said, the ending is fantastic. One of the best I've ever seen. And that's because it's not a big action scene or a showstopper. Rather the scene that saves the day is intimate, quieter, something that fits Moana's character perfectly.Moana is a great film. It's not perfect and personally I do like Frozen and Zootopia better, but it's still head and shoulder above its competition and a proud mark for Disney once again.",Null,0,2,19 June 2017
Ocean's Twelve," Utterly forgettable
","This film's biggest sin is that it just isn't as interesting as a heist film should be. I'm writing this review about a month after I saw the film, and I honestly had to read the Wikipedia plot summary to even remember what I was supposed to talk about.The first film was great because it had a very clear premise and the twists all played with the viewer's expectation and the conventions of the genre. This is just plain unpredictable, and not in a good way. You have no way of knowing where the story is going to move next and this is a problem, because the film keeps throwing new characters and locations into the mix in order to liven up the film, but all it ends up doing is diluting the plot to a point where the viewer couldn't care less what happens next.The characters are also a bit of a hit and miss. Some of the returning characters, like most of the Ocean Crew, are fine. They haven't really evolved in between the films, but they work like they are. All the new character and especially Julia Roberts' Tess are utterly uninteresting and/or unlikable. Even a cameo from Bruce Willis ends up being just plain weird instead of good, as unbelievable as that sounds. And the less is said about the 'villains' the better.This is not a good sequel. It tries to follow in the footsteps of the original, but it has none of its intrigue, charm or ability to tell a coherent story. If you're a major fan of heist movies, you might find some good things in this - and yeah, the locations are actually pretty nice - but the rest of you, don't bother.",Null,0,0,25 December 2013
Crash," We all suffer from the same curse
","Crash, directed by Paul Haggis, is a collection of intertwining stories set in Los Angeles. We follow a pair of cops, for example, who in turn pull over a vehicle, the driver of which we then follow around for a while, and so on. Kind of like Pulp Fiction, but with the emphasis on theme rather than style.That theme in this case being that of prejudice. These characters are victims and perpetrators of racism, bigotry and hate. Or, as the movie want you to realize, they're often both at the same time depending on the circumstances. Being a victim of racial slurs and worse doesn't keep you from throwing similar slurs around in a different setting. Those who are bullied often become bullies themselves to seize back some of the power that was taken from them. And that's a vicious cycle.It's a poignant message, and what I appreciate about this film is its neutrality. It doesn't take sides, and if it condemns, it condemns us all as equals. Very few characters in this film are completely without a blame, which rings true to me as a viewer.The acting is also topnotch, as it should be for a film of this substance. Matt Dillon's Academy Award nominated performance is one of the best in the film easily, though I also like Shaun Toub and Michael Pe√±a a lot. But truly there are no bad performances in this film.Crash is one of the best films about race, racism and bigotry I've seen.

Snatch," Blast of hooligan gangster fun
","Imagine a gangster movie directed, or at the very least presented, by Quentin Tarantino. Except that it takes place in London and has a healthy heap of Monty Python thrown in the mix. That's basically Snatch in a nutshell. Directed by Guy Ritchie, who's probably most well-known as the director of those Sherlock Homes films starring Robert Downey Jr.But let me tell you, this here is much more his speed, clearly. Snatch is a fast-paced, ever moving pair of intertwining tales. One of them concerning a humongous diamond being smuggled through London and the other about an upcoming underground boxing match. The character cast is sizable to say the least, but each character is such a unique snowflake (in both good and bad) that there's absolutely no fear of getting them mixed up or forgetting about them.The directing and the camerawork have that Ritchie flair to them. You know those fight sequences in Sherlock where Downey Jr. would first visualize what he wanted to do and then went on and did it with the camera flying around looking for the oddest angle possible. Snatch is a lot like that, but toned down just enough that it's more stylistic than annoying. I at least enjoyed it a lot.As for the movie as a whole. It's gory, it's dark, it's goofy, it doesn't take its characters all that seriously, despite some of them quite literally feeding people to pigs, and... it's simply so much fun. A horror roller coaster ride in the best possible meaning of the term. See it and get blasted away.",Null,0,1,18 February 2018

Helmed by the legendary Spike Lee.As you'd expect, the questions and themes concerning race and race relations are heavily featured. The films speaks for unity and peace, but it's also a cautionary tale about hate and intolerance. The ugliest performances are of course given by the Klan members, but the film does show that the other side had advocates for violence as well. Which is of course natural. We're all human, after all.And speaking of ugly performances, I have to raise my hat for these actors. Washington, and Adam Driver as Detective Flip Zimmerman, play the two officers doing the infiltration, and they're wonderful, but I can only imagine what it must been like for Topher Grace and Jasper P√§√§kk√∂nen playing the roles of David Duke , the grand wizard of KKK, and Felix, a psychotic Klan member, respectively. P√§√§kk√∂nen especially has some truly haunting scenes where he has to spout the most vitriolic, hate-filled, blood mad filth imaginable. Scary performance, I have to admit.Aside from that the film is very solid on the technical side of things, has a sense of humour and is all around well-told. I did feel that the last act was perhaps a bit more outlandish than it necessarily needed to be. I get that the director wanted a big finale and to raise the stakes, but I wonder whether the focus should have been maintained on the actual issues, which are still ongoing even in today's world. The last minutes focus on those modern day issues, which was a nice finishing touch, but still.Nevertheless, a very good film. It should fill us with shame that such a world of hatred and intolerance still has a place in this day and age. And if this film opens the eyes of even one of its viewers, its existence has been justified.",Null,3,9,11 October 2018
Spider-Man: Homecoming," Marvel and Spider-Man both manage to still feel fresh... somehow
","The original Sam Raimi Spider-Man was a huge movie back in 2002. One of the first successful superhero films ever made and something of a trend setter. Marvel Cinematic Universe especially owns a lot of its style, sense of humour and even identity to that film and the trilogy that followed. Since then we've had another Spider-Man reboot prior to this one, which didn't seem to please the fans enough to last. It tried some new things, but not enough.Which is why it pleases me to say that Spider-Man: Homecoming is one the freshest Marvel films in recent memory. It still belongs in the same universe and the happenings of The Avengers function as the starting point for the film. And yet its outlook and focus are something we haven't seen all that much in the MCU so far. Tom Holland's Spider-Man/Peter Parker is a street level superhero that still has to play in the big leagues. The Marvel Netflix series have introduces us to other street level characters, but their problems stayed on the street level as well. In this film Spider-Man rubs elbows with the likes of Tony Stark. Thus creating something interesting to watch.Aside from that it's the usual bag of Marvel goodness. Amazing visuals, great set pieces, good action, witty dialogue. All the things why we love this franchise so much. Tom Holland strikes a comfortable balance between Tobey Maguire's nerdy Peter Parker and Andrew Garfield's wiz kid Spider-Man. Personally I still kind of hope they had continued with Garfield, but Holland is so good in his role that it's a wishful hope at best.But putting all that aside, there's one other thing that elevates this film even above most Marvel films. And that's Michael Keaton as Vulture. Now this is what has been missing from most Marvel films. A charismatic, identifiable villain with clear, understandable motives that rise above the clich√©d 'I wish to tear creation asunder and wreck evil for the sake of evil'. This guy has layers and is even fun to watch. Loki is still the best villain Marvel has given us, but I feel comfortable saying that Vulture is a pretty clear number two. Well, three if you count Kilgrave from Jessica Jones. Perhaps even four with Wilson Fisk taking the third place, but I'm not quite sure who would come out on top in that particular match-up.Still, very good movie. It delivers exactly what it should and is a breath of fresh air in a franchise that continues to travel from victory to victory.",Null,0,3,18 August 2017
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," The most powerful men hiding under a table, hoping for the best
","Stanley Kubrick's pitch black satire about the nuclear threat and the ends of which mankind is capable of going to prove its superiority.The plot goes that a US general has gone rogue and ordered a nuclear attack against the Soviets. The radios have been disabled and there's no conceivable way to call off the attack. Men in the War Room argue back and forth, assigning blame, getting desperate, getting emotional. While on the skies the planes march towards Soviet airspace - undetectable, unstoppable.It's a beautiful scenario, made even more poignant by its sheer absurdity. It tells something about a movie when it opens with a message from US Air Force, stating that the thing showcased in the movie could never, ever, under no circumstance, no way, no how, happen. Now please crawl out from under your beds.And this could be an unbearably heavy movie. But Kubrick helms it as a satire. The characters are amazingly out there, as are the lines of dialogue, the sets, the music. But the subject matter is still so large, so huge, so scary, that horror lurks underneath all the comedy. It underlines every scene, every moment. Most of us now have grown up in a world where nuclear war has always been a possibility. And in this film that fact can never be forgotten.The acting is also superb with the MVP award easily going to George C. Scott, playing the role of one the president's military advisors.Fantastic scenario, fantastic film making, fantastic actors. You'll laugh, while also feeling the cold sweat dripping down your spine.",Null,4,5,12 June 2018
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," Sign of things to come
","The final installation in the original Star Wars trilogy and a culmination of an epic story about galaxy in peril, about the battle between two ancient factions, about the battle between good and evil, control and passion.Personally, I think it's a significant step backwards from the previous two movies. The story doesn't flow as smoothly, the ending climax isn't as exciting as the two previous ones (we have to blow the Death Star again?), the characters are not as good as they used to be and the new stuff, which there is still a lot of, to the film's credit, is not as good as in the previous one. In this film we see for the first time the signs and phenomena that would come to haunt us in the prequel trilogy.To go over a few of the highlights, we have the ewoks. Now, apparently they were supposed to be wookies, which would have been amazing. Chewbacca is a fan favourite, and we would have gotten to see his people, his culture, more laser crossbows, all that good stuff. Instead we have the elite troops of the Galactic Empire being beaten back by an army of teddy bears. I'm not the only one seeing the problem here, right?Plus, the characters. Luke, Han and Vader are still very good and especially Vader has some his best moments in this film, especially near the end. But Leia, for example, has been relocated to a complete support role, to the point that she really has no point in being in this film. She's a far cry from the nail hard, snarky, blaster-toting space princess she was in the first film. Not quite on the Padm√©-level of chickification, but heading in the same direction. Ian McDiarmid also has his screen debut as the Emperor in this film, and while he is amazing and will pretty much carry the prequel films alone with his charisma, here his over the topness is a bit unsettling because you're already wary and looking for flaws because of the ewoks.Then again, the effects are still amazing, the battle scenes are exciting, the final confrontation with Luke, Vader and the Emperor is one of cinema's finest for a reason, the space battle of Endor is a good one and the story is by no means bad one. It just isn't as good as the two previous ones, which are two of the best adventure stories ever put on film. So go ahead and see the film if you've liked the trilogy so far. It's not as good, if you ask me, but it's still a fitting conclusion to the saga.",Null,2,4,29 November 2015
Fast & Furious 6," Enjoyable mayhem
","Keeping up the momentum from the previous film, the sixth film in the Fast & Furious saga sees the return of Brian (Paul Walker) and Dom (Vin Diesel) as they're once again pulled into doing a job. This time to save Dom's supposedly dead girlfriend, Letty (Michelle Rodriguez). And I have to say, it's good to have her back.Pretty much everyone from the previous film is back, which means that the dream team is still holding strong and this film continues to build their bond together. Both one on one and as a team. And it's easily the best part of the film.Furthermore, it's still a Fast & Furious film. Meaning fast cars, hot chicas, good music and great action scenes. The fifth film took the action in this franchise to a much grandiose direction and this film keeps up the trend. And I have to say that I love it. The first few films were fine for what they were, but these last few films have simply been in a class of their own.As for the villain, played by Luke Evans, I have to say that he could have been better. Evans is a talented actor and I've seen him pull off some really impressive characters, but this time he swung and missed. Part of that is the writing, no doubt. I'd actually go as far as three fourths. But some of that is on Evans as well. I simply didn't find him that threatening.Still, if you've liked the franchise so far, this is more of the same goodness.",Null,0,0,18 May 2020
Pan's Labyrinth," Horror fairy tale
","Pan's Labyrint is one of those film that could only come into existence in the hands of an exceptional director. In this case Guillermo del Toro. The man in question has proved himself to such a degree that nowadays he can do pretty much anything he wants and it will get greenlighted. And such he is free to pursue his passions and provide us with these breathtakingly beautiful, scary and brilliant movies.Pan's Labyrinth is an excellent example. With a quick glance it's nothing more than a fantasy story with a dark art style and some scary parts. But it's much more than that. Most of the film actually takes place in a Spanish forest estate during the horrors of World War Two. The fairy realm we eventually get to visit is certainly scary-looking and creepy, but the real horror in this film comes the corruption and evil of men, not beasts and creatures.It's also an interesting film because you're never quite sure how much of it is real. Ofelia's (played brilliantly and convincingly by Ivana Baquero) blight under the tyranny of his new stepfather would make the argument that it's all happening in her head rather probable, but the film is more layered than that. It allows you to choose. Perhaps all of it DOES happen in her head and it's just her way of escaping a horrible reality. But it could all be true. But only if you want it to be.Saying anything more would spoil the film too much and this is one of those movies that needs to be experienced. A lot of its scariness and atmosphere comes from its unpredictability and its surprises. It's a gorgeous, upsetting, uplifting and wonderful film and one of del Toro's best.",Null,1,2,9 August 2014
The Flowers of War," Touching war piece
","The Flowers of War tells a tale of survival, war time brutality, sacrifice and hope shining from within even the most unlikely source. It tells the tale of John Miller (Christian Bale) and the girls and women he helped to protect and hide during the Japanese attack on Nanking in 1937. Loosely based on real events, it's a movie that's sure to elicit some emotions.First of all, to the movie's credit, it at least attempts to rise above taking sides. It shows that there exists good in both sides, but it also doesn't shy away from the atrocities committed by both of them. Ultimately it's a tale one's willingness to do the right thing even at the expense of one's own life and safety.The film's directed by Zhang Yimou, of House of Flying Daggers and Curse of the Golden Flower fame, so you can bet that the production values are top notch. The actors are also very talented, and not just Bale. Ni Ni, playing the role of a prostitute Yu Mo, received a lot of praise for her performance, and deservedly so.In the end it's hard to say more without spoiling the experience. The Flowers of War is a very good war movie told from the point of view of a survivor. It's quite brutal and straight, but it also shines a light on the best sides of humanity. Worth a watch.",Null,0,0,24 July 2015
Megamind," Nice little subversion of superhero tropes
","Comic books have sometimes hypothesized what would happen if a supervillain actually won against their heroic nemesis. Often these stories are of rather dark variety. Not so much here, keeping in mind that this is still a Dreamworks film aimed primarily at children.Still, the protagonist of the film is a supervillain and he does win, defeating his archrival, Metro Man, through sheer stroke of luck. And he takes over the city. And rules over it with an iron fist. And as you can imagine, he ends up being not quite as content with it as he might have imagined. So much so that he starts to yearn for the 'bad old days'.The concept works, in my opinion. Will Ferrell has a lot of comedic chops and in his hands Megamind can be diabolically scheming, sympathetic, pathetic and even kind of a lovable goof. I also really like Minion, his main enforcer. Clever design, good voice acting from David Cross and some of the best lines. Tina Fey's Roxanne Ritchie (gotta love that comic book alliteration) is perhaps a bit too by the book damsel in distress, but she has a personality despite that, and could have been a lot worse.The thing that rubbed me the wrong way is the character of Hal Stewart (Jonah Hill), initially a co-worker of Roxanne's. I get that he was supposed to come across as sleazy and to practically scream the concept of bad touch. I just think they took it a tad too far. This was an uncomfortable character in all the wrong ways and I think they could have gotten the character concept across without making the audience collectively pull their collars.Then again, keeping in mind how many women still get needlessly harassed by men who just don't seem to get the concept of 'No!', perhaps it's a good thing that the younger generation has such a bad example as Hal.Megamind is a refreshing take on the superhero genre. Definitely worth a watch for all wanting another take on the usual clich√©s.",Null,0,0,12 September 2019
The Best Years of Our Lives," Touching, if a bit rose-coloured
","World War Two is over and three men meet on a plane on their way back home in the good old US of A. They're each from the same town, but otherwise they couldn't be more different in their war careers, origins, current occupations and future prospects. This movie is their story as their lives intermix and they all have to learn how to deal with normal life after the ravages of war.The filming for this movie began only seven months after the war and the movie actually contains an actual war veteran as one of its main characters. Harold Russell lost both of his hands in a training accident during the last years of the war, and likewise his character, Homer Parrish, has to deal with the loss. Truth be told, it took me a while to realize they had actually gotten an amputee for the role. I kept praising the special effects, especially for such an old movie...Details like that certainly give the film an authentic vibe, but then again, not a lot of time had passed since the war, and the long-term horrors and symptoms these men would have to fave had yet to surface. As such it's a bit of an idyllic version of what would happen, but I'd be lying if I said it wasn't pleasant to watch.Especially because the film is written and acted so well. I liked all of these characters, with special mention going to Peggy Stephenson (Teresa Wright). I liked how they could, despite their engulfing differences, look each other in the eye, find something that echoes and treat each other as equals. That's an important message, which we quite often forget.What more to say? It's a pleasant movie to watch, especially if you're looking for a drama after which you won't feel the weight of the world on your shoulders.",Null,0,3,16 December 2018
Suicide Squad," Scraping the bottom here
","Come here, DC. Come here, we need to have a talk. This is your intervention. Now, I don't know who first gave you these ideas. And don't play coy with me, son. I found these under your bed. Recognize these? Yeah, I know what these are. The parents have been warned about these Batman-And-Nothing-But-Batman ideas that have been circulating in our neighborhood. Now, I don't know who - though I'm thinking it was that Snyder boy, although young mister Nolan is also a suspect - but as it comes to you, it needs to stop. Can't you see what they have done to you. You used to be such a happy boy. You went outside even when it wasn't raining. You talked about things other than horrific civilian casualties and billions in property damage. There was joy in you, colours even. You need to understand that Batman... is whack. It's not cool, it's not good for you and it needs to stop.Yeah... as you probably figured out by now, not a huge fan of this film. We all prayed that this would be the film to change the course for the DCEU. After only two films we were already tired of grey backgrounds, grey characters, grey moralities and nothing but rain and gloom. And sure, this looked pretty grey as well in the trailers, but at least it promised us something that we had sorely missed: a sense of humour.But no, what we ended up getting was even worse than the previous films. Those films were overly gloomy, dark and trying too hard to recapture the aesthetic of Nolan's Batman trilogy. But at least they had pretty clear story lines, fleshed out characters and you could nominally root for the main characters. Whereas this film is just as grey, dark and gloomy, perhaps even more so, and it had none of those things. There are way too many characters, meaning that we in our heads relocate them to the cannon fodder file almost immediately. The story makes no sense whatsoever and is frustratingly circular in that if the people setting out to solve a problem would have done nothing, things would have been fine. And then there's the fact that you can't even really care for the main characters. Because they're villains! And the funny thing is that they remind us of this constantly.And sure, villains are cool and they can be empathized with, but that last one requires effort. And usually inhuman space monsters as opponents for contrast. Here the only even remotely cool villain is Deadshot. But that's because he's played by Will Smith. The man could play a potato sack with no lines of dialogue and he'd still have a fair chance of being the coolest character in the film. Plus, in this film it helps that he's one of two villains to have any substantial backstory. The other being Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie), who surprise surprise is the other villain worth caring about.Had this been like the trailers promised, it would have been pretty good. But it's not. It's not cool, it's not funny and there's barely any Joker in it. Now, personally I hate Jared Leto as Joker, but at least he would have been something to focus on. And had this film even had the music like in the trailers, it could have had something resembling a style. But no, the music is there for a few seconds at a time and never is the scene wrapped around the music. Wasted opportunity if there ever was one.This is the worst DCEU film to date, and that's saying something. Not worth seeing, not worth your money and not worth the effort put into it. You're on thin ice, DC. Get into rehab!",Null,1,1,29 June 2017
Taxi Driver," Enjoyable
","I had heard a lot about this movie before even seeing it. It is often mentioned along with Fight Club and both of the Psychos as movies about angry adult men raging against the society and its corruption. So my expectation were high when I sat down to watch down this movie. And, truth be told, it didn't disappoint. It's a powerful movie with many memorable scenes, pieces of dialogue and a powerful main actor, the man himself, Robert De Niro.The movie actually reminded me a lot about Rambo. Both movies have a war veteran, who just doesn't seem to be able to connect with the outside world anymore. They wander aimlessly through the society that doesn't care about them anymore and that tries to keep their influence to a minimum. The difference is that although Rambo is a bitter and at times brutally violent man, there's still a hint of idealism within him. He wants to be the good guy and gets depressed when the society once again disregards him. Not so much with Travis Bickle (De Niro), who's only purpose seems to be to get by. To waste away his life, half-heartedly trying to connect with it, but as he gets shunned again and again, that detachment turns to rage and we enter the Psycho/Fight Club territory.And the movie makes that change work. The film is shot extremely well, with the first half of the film just drifting around, slowly following this uncomfortable, but strangely charismatic man, who always seems to either say too much or leave something vital out of his speeches. We get to see the city through his eyes and the city is very quickly found lacking. And as the city and its people keep dragging him down, he eventually accepts his apparent course and that's where the real teeth-jarring suspension starts. The final third of the film is one slow heart-stopper after another.So yeah, the movie works, it really works. It's not for everyone and if you want your movies bright and optimistic, this really isn't your film. But for those that are intrigued by antiheroes and the ugliness of man's world, this is one of those films that you just have to see.",Null,0,1,9 April 2012
Shutter Island," Intense, pure Scorsese
","Martin Scorsese has always had the ability to pull his viewers in. His movies usually take place in a tormentingly bleak and familiar modern world, mixed in with small hints of grandeur, exotic and downright unfamiliar. Like so in this case as well. Shutter Island has a familiar feel to it. The idea of a mental asylum has been deeply ingrained into our collective cultural psyche and Scorsese uses that, presenting us an island that's both a clich√© and something terrifyingly new. The colours are just a bit off, the characters sometimes step away from the roles that we have given them in our heads, the plot doesn't dance to the pipe that we all expect to hear. It's a harrowing experience at times, which is exactly the reason that makes the movie so interesting. The movie constantly throws us questions that we start to answer from our experience with these kinds of movies, but then we realize that the answer doesn't fit and we are left feeling lost and intrigued.Not to say that all of the twists are completely unexpected or even that original. It's a thriller after all and some genre conventions are still being respected, lovingly I might add. Scorsese has the ability to raise the ante, make us question our decisions and expectations, and at the same time make us guess and ponder about the case. Which makes for a great thriller. Add in some really nice acting, very nice editing and cinematography and a score that's just right for the mood, and you have in your hands an excellent film. Though I personally didn't care for the constant flashbacks as I thought that they broke the mood, but afterwards I could see their purpose, so my singular big complaint was reduced to a nitpick.All in all not Scorsese's best film, but a great piece of film-making, nonetheless. It's everything that a thriller should be and keeps surprising its viewers all the way to the end.",Null,2,4,18 July 2012
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," Fantastic action espionage thriller
","One of the best things about the Marvel Cinematic Universe is the variety of their characters and the possibilities that stem from that fact. It allows them to make a huge variety of movies, straddling different genres with ease. Whereas the Thor movies belong more comfortably in the fantasy genre and whereas the first Captain America film was a war period piece, this film can more accurately be described as an espionage thriller.And it works great! It totally embraces the genre and gives us an interesting, multilayered and nail-bitingly exciting mystery to unravel, yet it still feels like a Marvel film - perhaps even more so than some, because it's the film in Phase Two that arguably moves the story forward the most.So what is this story? Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) has joined S.H.I.E.L.D. after the events of The Avengers and along with Natasha Romanoff a.k.a. Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) he fights against global threats to keep Earth safe. Yet it seems that tensions are rising even within S.H.I.E.L.D. and when an old Soviet threat, the Winter Soldier, re-enters the fray, Captain America has to use all of his skills and assets to solve the mystery before the world is doomed.Basic premise, but its the execution that's so much fun. Johansson and Evan are a fantastic battle couple together, having some of the best chemistry I've seen in a long time. The various supporting actors are also A-list through and through, delivering some great performances. I also really appreciate how the film ties so many of the other Marvels movies together, yet it doesn't feel crowded with references.The action scenes are also fantastic. Captain America is one of the more normal superheroes in the Avengers, yet that somehow makes all the action seem even more exciting because you know that he is not that much above the human norm, making all of his feats seem even more impressive. The fight choreographies are also suitably down to earth yet impressive, the special effects support all other aspects beautifully and it's simply a very competent film on the technical level.If I had to name flaw, I'd say that the name of the film is a bit misleading as the eponymous Winter Soldier isn't really the central focus of the film, which can lead to some disappointments if you've set your expectations erroneously.Nevertheless, Captain America: The Winter Soldier is one of the best Marvel movies made to date and a clear proof that Steve Rogers is the beating heart of the franchise.

Life of Pi," A touch overrated, but not a bad film by any means
","I don't think this film would have gotten as much hype if it hadn't happened to hit the 3D wave at precisely the right time. Because, while it's a gorgeous movie, and one of the best 3D experiences to date, its story doesn't match its visual splendor.The setting is definitely imaginative. A young man, survivor of a sunken ship, is stranded on a lifeboat with a Bengal tiger of all things. Together they must face the horror, beauty and mystery of wide open sea to reach solid land once again. I just don't think they do everything they could have done with such a premise. It's outlandish enough that you can pretty much kiss any sense of realism goodbye. And to its credit, the film doesn't try to take itself too seriously, and the unreliable narrator the film utilizes only adds to this while neatly explaining all the weird aspects of the story. Yet most of the time is spent following the main character around on the boat as he tries to not get eaten alive by the tiger. That's interesting, sure, but not really Oscar-worthy, if you ask me.Had they done something more out there, it would have kept me entertained far better. Now there are some things they encounter at the sea that are very cool to look and and also imaginative enough to arouse my interest. I say some, because more often than not it's one or the another. Either it's absolutely gorgeous or it's interesting on an idea level. It should be both more often than not.In the end that means I think this is a good film. Not great, but good. It's definitely worth a watch and I can see why so many people enjoyed it as much as they did.

Chak de! India," Clich√©d, but in a good way
","A disgraced hockey player (Shah Rukh Khan) has stayed out of the limelight for years after his team lost an important match. But now he has returned to coach a women's hockey team during the World Cup, hoping to regain his honour.Chak de! India is a pretty by the numbers sports film. You have an underdog team of misfits. You have a tough, but fair coach with unconventional methods. You have the cool kids. You have the odd kids. You have the big kid. You have the small kid. Well, they're all adults in this case, but this might as well be a teenage flick.That being said, I do like what the film does with its clich√©s. Like the clich√© where the players don't initially get along at all and have to learn to play with each other. Well, India is such a huge country and these women have been gathered from all over, so it makes sense that they don't necessarily understand one another right from the start. They barely even speak the same language, after all. And when they do start to become a team, it's a good message for India as a whole.Still, if there's one thing I'd wish, it's that the film had dodged at least some of the clich√©s. Now it seems set on collecting them all. And I mean all. Every single sports film clich√© you can think of, it's in this film. Sure, they're done well and they're fun for the most part, but they're still clich√©s.Nevertheless, I had fun with Chak de! India. Not the best sports film I've seen, but it has passion.

Ocean's Thirteen," Ocean's Eleven Lite
","The first Ocean's Eleven (the remake, not the Rat Pack version) is a classic heist film. Good team, excellent plot, clever twists, action, excitement, the whole nine yards. Ocean's Twelve, the sequel, is a convoluted mess that is best left forgotten. Ocean's Thirteen, the movie in question, falls somewhere in between. It's a huge leap forward in quality when compared to its immediate predecessor, but it doesn't quite reach the novelty and sheer fun that the first had in spades.We return to Las Vegas as Reuben (Elliott Gould) has fallen to some hard times, being cheated on a casino deal by heinous Willy Bank (Al Pacino) and now it's up to Danny Ocean (George Clooney) and his crew to settle the score. It's a workable plot, though a touch too similar to the first movie to really impress with its originality. The movies look too similar for you to be able to appreciate it fully, and even the twists are somewhat predictable because of this.And while the acting is generally very good, I don't really buy Pacino as an effective villain in a heist movie. The man can certainly play a villain, no doubt about it, but he doesn't quite hit the right notes here. Especially when the movie also contains Andy Garcia, the slimy ball of haughtiness from the first film. I also have to note that none of the characters have evolved at all. They're still the same old rogues they were in the first film, and while I don't expect a lot of character development in a cheerful heist film series, I'd appreciate if there was a little bit of it.All that being said, I do think it's an enjoyable film. The heist itself is a lot of fun, the characters are still delightfully quirky and it seems like the film crew had a lot of fun.",Null,1,1,14 June 2015
Lost in Translation," Good movie, but not for everyone because of its subtlety
","Many reviewers say that some people don't get this film, because they cannot understand its purpose, that of a slow and subtle story that tells about loneliness, aimlessness and feeling detached from your own life. Thus there seem to be two kinds of people: those who love this movie for its ability to tell a story with minimal plot and those who hate it because it's boring and nothing happens.I'm somewhere in the middle. I didn't think that nothing happens, but I actually thought that it lacked something. There are a lot of shots where people just seem to exist side by side, sitting somewhere or lying around on their beds. Sure, those shots are needed, because they relate the feeling of having nothing important to do, one of the key themes of this film, but they're not very interesting to witness. And that's this movie, intellectually interesting and yeah, I can relate to these characters, because I've had days when I've felt like they do throughout this whole film, but the film is a bit boring.So, is it a bad film? Not at all. The imagery, for one, is extremely pleasing, and the modern day Japan is portrayed beautifully with its old traditions that are beginning to mix with the phenomena of today. Plus Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson are both powerful actors that give brilliant performances. Final thoughts, it's a good movie, but it's not for those that want their movies fast and furious, with high emotions and flashy action scenes.",Null,1,2,1 February 2012
Tangled," Return to form
","Disney's 50th animated canon feature film - though they cheated by retroactively adding Dinosaur into the list - and in many ways a brilliant comeback for the studio.Tangled, based on the story Rapunzel by Brothers Grimm, feels very familiar if you grew up with the Disney Renaissance films. It's a princess movie, with lots of action, brilliant animation and lots of song numbers. Yet you can definitely see the decade or two that separates it from the Renaissance. Rapunzel is a very different kind of heroine. You can see a lot of Belle and Ariel in her, perhaps even a bit of Mulan, but she is very much a princess for the new century. Very dynamic, very ready with words, very quirky even. The same with our 'prince', Flynn Rider, who is to Aladdin what Aladdin was to the princes of the 40s and 50s, while still being very kid friendly and accessible. They both have this attitude to them. And while at times it can be a bit heavy-handed, I do admit liking the update. For the most part.I also really like the villain, Mother Gothel. She's what you would get if you took Lady Tremaine from Cinderella, but made her more subtle. She's very clearly an abusive parent, but you're not quite certain if the abuse is intentional or whether she just doesn't know any other way. Her relationship with Rapunzel is one of the more fascinating parent-child dynamics I've yet seen from Disney.And overall it's just a fun film, exactly what you should expect from Disney. It can seem a bit calculated from time to time, especially when it comes to the Dreamworks-esque hipness of the main characters, but it's still a good adventure and solid entertainment all around. Recommended for all fans of Disney and good, solid animation.Though the name of the film should have been Rapunzel! Curse you, overly cautious marketing.",Null,2,2,28 June 2016
Doctor Strange," Doesn't quite reach that Marvel brilliance
","The fourteenth film of the Marvel Cinematic Universe and the one where they most unambiguously try to bring magic into their existing universe. In this movie Benedict Cumberbatch plays Dr. Stephen Strange, a renowned neurosurgeon who must set out on a journey after a car crash ruins his hands. This will eventually end up with him discovering the existence of the mystic arts, or magic if you prefer.The movie contains pretty much everything we've come to expect from Marvel films. Absolutely, phenomenally gorgeous visuals, which in this particular case are especially noteworthy, because they take the reality bending aspect of magic and really play with it. Think Inception, only even more kaleidoscopic. Granted, sometimes the visuals are a tad busy, but most of the time they're simply gorgeous.We also get great actors, good humour and a villain that could have been better. Exactly what most of the Marvel movies have been all about. But in this case I found myself noticing the story formula a bit too much. It felt like the movie was simply going through motions, giving us the old, trusted, tested and patented Marvel story. I felt myself missing something new, something exciting, a twist on the old pattern. But it never came.The second big problem I have with the movie is that the magic is actually pretty boring. What I mean by that, is that it makes sense that Stephen Strange only has a few tricks and spells in his repertoire. He's only starting out. But the villain, one of the most powerful magic users on Earth, uses the exact same tricks, with very little variation. Sure there's the dark power he's drawing, and some of the magic users have different magical artefacts, but it still felt stale, unimaginative. Elemental attacks, summoning creatures, mind control, invisibility, transmuting the terrain to your advantage, the list goes on. None of this is seen in the film. It's just blasting coloured lights and teleporting most of the time. Allows for some good kung fu fighting, certainly, but does not come close to being what it should be.That being said, the ending is a huge exception to the issue above. It's creative, set up well in advance, makes sense for Strange's character and is simply entertaining as well as visually interesting.All in all, for me Doctor Strange falls on the lower end of the scale when it comes to MCU movies. It is certainly a good film in its own right, but doesn't quite match the splendour of its predecessors.",Null,0,1,5 January 2017
Barry Lyndon," A Scoundrel's Tale
","You have to hand it to Stanley Kubrick. The man has range. All of his movies are acclaimed classics, many of them are regarded among the best in their respective genres and they cover a truly astonishing range of different subject matters. With this movie that being a period costume drama.Barry Lyndon is at its heart a picaresque story, which is a Spanish novel type where the story follows a young man, often coming from a lower social class, trying to improve his lot in life, often mixing with the high class aristocrats. The style is often satirical, even comedic, despite the grim happenings and bleak tone. And that's essentially this film in a nutshell, though I certainly hope that in the original novels, the main characters are more likable.Yet, while I do not like Barry Lyndon (Ryan O'Neal) as a human being, the whole film is still very watchable. The set pieces are stunning - with Kubrick trying to mimic the paintings of the era and largely succeeding - the costuming is great and while the plot is very slow and deliberate, it's still endlessly intriguing. The events are also refreshingly diverse, with Barry experiencing very different kinds of adventures throughout his life.Is it Kubrick's best work? I don't think so. The technical aspects are once again groundbreaking, the depth of detail is astonishing and the sheer mastery of his craft is evident in every frame. But, the story just isn't as unique as in his other films. I'm more impressed by the technicalities than I am with the so-called meat of the film.Very much worth a watch even still, don't get me wrong.",Null,1,2,29 August 2018
Interstellar," A wasted opportunity
","Honestly, I was expecting more from Christopher Nolan. The man is capable of unique vision, of scope that comes across only every once in a while. Such as seen in Inception and The Dark Knight. But this? This is still a good movie, but that's all. It's not great, mainly because of limitations in storytelling, dialogue and style.The biggest problem is that Nolan's faults shine through more than usual. His over-reliance on exposition dialogue, his longwindedness and tendency to linger too long in certain scenes. In most of his movies you get the sense that he had one idea too many. Well, in this he had easily two or three ideas too many. This could have been a two hour movie, without a doubt, and it would have been better for it.It also seems to have problems deciding what it's trying to be. Is it a hard scifi epic along the lines of 2001: A Space Odyssey, or something more leaning towards drama and so called space opera. Certain scenes lean more towards the former, some towards latter, and they don't mesh at all.That being said, it's a fine movie. First of all, it's absolutely gorgeous. I have slight problems with the designs of the actual planets, but every single shot of space is jaw-dropping. I also like that they went and paid actual scientists to figure out what a black hole might look like, among other things. That shows dedication and certainly makes for a very memorable visual.The cast is also superb. The problems with the characters stem from the script, not the actors, and all of them have great chemistry together. One of the underlying themes in this movie is the relationship between father and daughter. Both Matthew McConaughey and Mackenzie Foy, as well as Michael Caine and Anne Hathaway make for a great pair and I have no complaints about their performances.Alas, I just cannot call Interstellar a great film. The ending alone would ruin it for me, but the whole journey is so needlessly long and slow that I never got into it. The movie has a lot of good ideas - the dying Earth, the robots, the black hole's affect on space-time - but those ideas are poorly realized and the whole just isn't as good as Nolan's previous work. It's worth watching, certainly, and it's not a bad film, not at all. Just a deeply flawed one.",Null,4,8,22 November 2014
The Grapes of Wrath," We suffer, we rise
","Great drought has brought endless dust storms into the state of Oklahoma. Many families have been driven from their homes by banks looking to reap profit despite the miserable conditions. As such the Joad family packs itself onto an aging truck and sets out towards California in hopes of finding a Golden Land. Based on a novel by the same by John Steinbeck, although I've been led to understand that the book is a lot more depressing and politically minded than this film. And if that's the case, what a depressing book it must be. Because the film isn't exactly a ray of sunshine either.And yet it is a triumph, in a sense. Henry Fonda and Jane Darwell play the leads as Tom Joad and his mother, and in them crystallize the themes of the film. All good things will end, nothing lasts forever and when hard times come, it's up to us to pick ourselves up and journey through them. Individual humans may falter, may fall, may perish, but humans as people have always survived. The film has some truly great monologues and speeches about this, and as an overall film it's all about that willingness to rise up, to bear the load, to survive. The Joads travel from one tragedy to another, and it is truly heartbreaking, but yet they endure. And that's what matters.The film also questions the basic necessities of life. When it matters, what do we need? We all need to eat, we all need to sleep. And if those basic needs are fulfilled, what then? It's natural for us to look after ourselves, including our families, perhaps our closest friends, but it takes something extra to care for anyone else. And yet, that extra caring has a meaning. Is that meaning needed, warranted or even essential? That's the question.The Grapes of Wrath shines as a rare gem. A film brilliantly acted, brilliantly told, with brilliant themes. If you aren't moved by this film, one has to wonder.",Null,2,2,12 September 2017
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," I left the theater disillusioned and sad
","Rian Johnson didn't leave J.J. Abrams much to work with, that much is true. All the things Abrams had tried to set up in The Force Awakens, Johnson simply tossed over his shoulder like Luke with his lightsaber.However, what Abrams did with this last film in the whole nine film saga, is about the worst thing he could have done. Johnson's actions were not those of a team player, but at least he tried something new. He wanted to take Star Wars into a new direction. So what did Abrams do? He grabbed the wheel, derailed the whole plot and forced it back to those same old tracks they've always traveled. Because why try something new when you can simply bring Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid) back and do the whole shtick with him wanting to rule the galaxy all over again.It's painfully clear that they didn't have an overarching plot for this trilogy. They flew by the seat of their pants and that shows. So now the Skywalker saga is complete and it ended as a shallow rehashing of old clich√É¬©s, already seen plots and recycled characters. Which makes it easily the worst film in the whole saga. You heard me correct.Now, objectively speaking, this is a very good-looking film. It's a bit grey and grainy compared to its two predecessors, but the locations are still grandeur, it feels and looks like Star Wars, and the score is nice.I also have to admit I really like the connection between Rey (Daisy Ridley) and Kylo (Adam Driver). Which also happens to be the only thing from The Last Jedi that Abrams carried over to this film. But it just works, allows for some of the best scenes in the whole film and is simply intriguing to watch.Overall, as a film, Episode IX has its ups and downs. If you're not that passionate about Star Wars, you're going to enjoy yourself just fine. But if you are, I'm predicting you're not going to like what you see here.",Null,9,14,7 January 2020
Pacific Rim," Pure and honest entertainment
","Having re-watched this movie, I can say with certainty that Guillermo del Toro has created something quite rare and wonderful here: an honest adventure film that in no way shies away from what it is and is none the worse for it.I think that many of us saw the trailers and become excited yet hesitant because surely it couldn't be as good as we were promised. Surely the film would focus too much on the political machinations of the evil government, or too much on the romance between our protagonists. Or the action would be too blurry, or there would be too little of it. Surely this kind of movie wouldn't be allowed to be 'just' about giant mechas fighting giant godzilla-monsters.And sure, there is some talk about governments, the protagonists are a man and a woman. But it's a movie about giant mechas fighting godzilla-monsters. There's nothing impure about that. It's what the movie is, simple as that. And it is fantastic! The action scenes are phenomenal. Vibrant with colours, beautifully executed, each unique and exciting to follow, with no shaky-cam, or needless bleakness, or annoying side characters butting in with one-liners.And it's more than that. There is an actual story in this film. Granted, it's a simple story about humanity rising against a common threat, with no big surprises or twists on the horizon. But, quite frankly, that's more than enough. The characters and their actors are of excellent quality, which breathes life into the story, giving it the depth it needs to elevate this film above a simple actionfest. And it does avoid or sidestep some obvious clich√©s quite beautifully, earning it some extra brownie points.Do you like robots? Do you like monsters? Does the idea of them fighting one another excite you? Then see this film. It's all you'd ever want, and more.",Null,0,1,5 September 2016
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," The weakest of the trilogy
","In my opinion Attack of the Clones is the weakest movie in the prequel trilogy and the worse Star Wars movie we've had to date, if you discount the Holiday Special.Not because it had any single element in it that was just awful, like Jar Jar or Saint Ani the Precocious, but because it just fails as a basic movie experience. The plot jumps around too much, the characters are the least interesting thing in the whole movie and the middle part syndrome of storytelling hits it quite badly. You've already established the characters in the first film, yet the big climax has to wait until the third. So what else is there to be done except character building. And the movie is awful at that, as already stated.I think that the biggest problem has to be that there is absolutely no chemistry between Hayden Christensen and Natalie Portman, playing Anakin Skywalker and Padm√© Amidala, respectively. This is supposed to be something huge. A romance that tore the galaxy apart and doomed the entire Jedi Order, yet it feels exactly like what it is. Two young adults, teenagers quite honestly, falling to their hormones. Oh yeah, that has Star Wars written all over it. And I could buy that, possibly, if I could even buy the fact that these two even like each other. But they don't. Especially Padm√© spends most of the film being visibly annoyed by Anakin, which I'm not sure was the intention. I think Portman simply had problems with the role, which is a shame because she can be really good in the right movie. I'm also annoyed that Padm√© was reduced to this from the tough infiltrating, gun-toting, droid-destroying badass that she was in the first film.But there is some good stuff as well. I still like Ewan McGregor a lot as younger Obi-Wan Kenobi. He has some hokey scenes as well, but I think I'm more inclined to blame the script rather than him in this case. Because in most scenes his dry wit is the only thing holding those scenes together. And naturally we have Ian McDiarmid as Supreme Chancellor Palpatine, who effortlessly hits just the right amount of over the top to remind us of the original trilogy. Because those weren't serious film, not really. They were deep enough to be taken seriously, but their tone was that of an adventure, of myth.Plus, the special effects are still awesome, even today. The music is very, very good. And it's actually very cool to see the original stormtroopers. Kudos for that.But, when it comes down to it, it's only an average movie at best. It has some really good elements in it, but it also has some really bad ones. It's worth a watch if you're into the franchise, but to me this is the low point of the story.",Null,2,6,11 November 2015
Corpse Bride," Tim Burton indulges himself
","Corpse Bride is about what I'd imagine goes around in Tim Burton's mind in any given moment. It is a sweet fairy tale painted in macabre colours. A children's colouring book if the only colour available was grey. And, if you've liked Mr. Burton's other creative efforts, this is pretty much more of the same and thus well worth a watch.The story follows a young man named Victor (Johnny Depp) who is about to marry a woman named Victoria (Emily Watson). He's out in the woods, practicing his vows, but happens to be overheard by the spirit of a dead woman, played by Helena Bonham Carter, who promptly decides that he was saying his vows to her and that they're now married.It's not a bad story and fits the usual grim Tim Burton imagery well. It's at the same time gothic, melancholy and just the right kind of naive. The characters are pretty one-note overall, especially the parents, but that also fits this kind of narrative well. It's supposed to be exaggerated and somewhat childlike.That being said, the film has some problems when it comes to style. Like, for example, the colour palate is about as grey as a coal mine. Even for Tim Burton. The underworld is a bit better in this regard, but not by much. The aforementioned land of the dead is also tonally jarring. The film begins as this heavily gothic Victorian affair, but then they drop into the underworld and suddenly the film is a jazz musical of all things. These two don't mix very well at all.Still, I can't say I minded seeing the film. Not the best effort any of the involved people have produced, but it has its moments and is well worth a watch if you have it in you to watch yet another Tim Burton extravaganza.",Null,0,0,11 September 2019
The Passion of Joan of Arc," One of the earliest masterpieces
","The Passion of Joan of Arc was a groundbreaking movie in its own time. Humongous set build just for the film, visionary camera techniques yet unseen, controversial subject matter, powerful role performances. Everything needed for a true classic.The film has withstood the test of time remarkably well. True, the story itself is a bit bare boned compared to modern films, but the fact that it's based on true events, real historical trial manuscripts, gives it gravitas.And it's simply shot so well. Director Carl Theodor Dreyer relies on extreme close-ups and harsh lighting to accentuate either the suffering or the grotesqueness of his characters, and it works wonders. Denying his actors makeup also helps, highlighting every pore and wrinkle on their faces.Ren√©e Jeanne Falconetti's performance as Joan of Arc has been hailed as one the all-time best in cinema history. Not without merit, I have to admit. The fragility of Joan and her situation in the hands of English comes through crystal clear. Yet, her performance is perhaps too fragile. If you study Joan of Arc at all, and especially if you read the actual trial manuscripts, you're going to meet a woman perfectly willing to give as good as she gets. A woman of conviction, who laid doubt into the hearts of even her harshest critics with her piety and belief. That aspect of her character is somewhat missing in Falconetti's performance.Still, it's a great film. A must see for all those that are studying cinema and for those that want to see the best films ever made.",Null,2,2,5 February 2020
"Monsters, Inc."," What's behind the door?
","It's such an odd premise for a movie, but yet it works so well. What if the monsters hiding in your closet are real and what if they have a society of their own, behind that door. What would that society look like and what part the scaring of little children would play in it.You can definitely build a movie around that and Pixar does so beautifully. In the process we get introduced to James P. 'Sulley' Sullivan and Michael 'Mike' Wazowski, the top scaring duo Monsters, Inc. has ever seen. Things go well, until a little girl child, adorably and promptly named Boo, slips through the door. Hijinks do indeed ensue.The movie has a strong idea and some topnotch characters going for it. I thoroughly enjoyed the relationship between Sully and Boo. The rest of the cast are voiced by some really talented people and all of the main cast have really great designs as well. I especially enjoyed Henry J. Waternoose III, the CEO. The side and background characters looked a bit more generic and blobbish in contrast, which is a shame, but then again they're not the focus.The only real flaw the film has is the story. It's not bad by any means, but it is not as strong as the other elements. Status quo is king, something upsets the status quo, hijinks, solution. No real surprises, no great stakes. I would have liked to explore the world a bit more or move beyond the obvious bad guy good guy setups.Still, a great animation film for all ages. Definitely worth a watch.",Null,0,0,4 January 2019
"Monsters, Inc."," Entertaining and endearing
","Not Pixar's strongest work - for me that's Wall-E - but still a great proof that the studio has the ability to turn the simplest of ideas upside down and give us something that we haven't seen before. Like in this case where the simple idea of monsters hiding in the closets of little children is given a completely new spin by making those monsters part of industry. They're just punch clock workers trying to earn a living. Ingenious idea, really.And the execution supports and strengthens that idea beautifully. The whole world full of these hideously weird creatures is laid bare in front of us, but we quickly find out that they're just like us with their mundane lives, romantic relationships and bad fur days. And therein lies the strength of this movie and Pixar movies in general. The characters are immensely identifiable and sympathetic. The moment that you see any of these characters, the moment that they open their mouth and start talking, you get them. You start living their lives from their perspective. (Though I have to say that I saw the Finnish dub of this movie, in which the voice acting, while decent, wasn't anything special, so I think that the movie had already lost part of its charm at that point, because the English version is full of talented actors, so it's probably the better version of this film.)For me the best part of this film was the relationship between Sulley (John Goodman) and Boo (Mary Gibbs). That little ninja girl is unbelievably adorable to begin with and then you add a ten feet tall blue hair monster cooing at her... It just melted my heart every time I saw it and made the ending even more precious to witness.If there's anything wrong with this film, it's that the story isn't that strong. It's your basic someone screws up and the status quo has to be restored without that someone getting into trouble, but of course something goes wrong and hilarity ensues. Nothing special there, but it was enjoyable to watch, so I wouldn't really call it a flaw as Pixar has the talent to work with simple stories. For them it's more about the characters and the details, not the story.So yeah, it's a good movie. Highly recommended for children and adults alike.",Null,0,1,13 April 2012
Ant-Man," Objectively fine, yet the worst Marvel movie so far
","So far Marvel hasn't dropped the ball with its Cinematic Universe. All of the movies in the Universe have been huge blockbusters, massively successful and, above all else, enjoyable beyond belief. And I'm not saying that Ant-Man is finally the one where they lose it. But it's the one that comes the closest.I think the biggest reason for this is the fact that this is such a small movie. It tells about a burglar, a likable guy in general, who unfortunately operates on the wrong side of the law, and has thus fallen on some bad times. But then comes a man who offers him one last gig that would set him for life, allowing him to provide for his daughter. And safe the world in the process, because this is still Marvel after all. A classic heist movie setup - aside from megalomaniac antagonist selling superweapons, of course - nothing wrong with that. The problems arise when you compare it to other Marvel films. We've had scoundrel protagonists before. Both Tony Stark and Peter Quill are more than a touch shady. Yet the difference between them and Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) is the scope of their actions. Both Stark and Quill save the world, operate on a vast arena, are larger than life in their character and in their actions. Lang saves the world, after a fashion, but it feels tacked on, like it doesn't belong.I'm also not a fan of the humour in this film. The range of this film's comedy is acknowledging an awkward situation, making a wiseass remark about it, holding a moment of silence and moving on. Sure, when Tony Stark does it, it's hilarious, but when Paul Rudd attempts the same, it's embarrassing. It's the epitome of British humour made by Americans. It doesn't work. At all. I hummed in amusement perhaps once, and that's it.I also have problems with Evangeline Lilly's character Hope. And the problem is not Lilly's performance, she's more than qualified. The problem is with the script, because at the end you realize that the only reason they were holding her back was for sequel bait. And that's simply not acceptable. The story of the film would have been over in minutes if they had simply done the logical thing and allowed her character to deal with the problem. But no, we have to leave room for a sequel. Cow manure, I say.And that's pretty much the film in a nutshell. It's a decent heist film with gorgeous special effects, average characters, awful sense of humour and an okay story. My least favourite Marvel movie so far, but an acceptable movie in general.",Null,0,2,24 November 2015
Captain America: The First Avenger," One of the best early MCU films
","It's interesting to watch this film after the events of The Endgame. Back when this movie came out, the Marvel Cinematic Universe was still finding its feet. The first Avengers films was still a distant dream, one we didn't really believe would come. But, looking at this film now, it's clear that the film makers believed in this project. Sure, it's a standalone film, but so much of what the MCU would eventually become is already present in this film.The story is of course about Steve Rogers, who eventually rises up to become Captain America, one of the most iconic superheroes of the 21st century. And I do like that it takes place in the 1940s. Makes it unique among the MCU films, gives it a different feel. Sure, we still have all those nice little science gizmos and magical whatsamacallits, but they have this nice pulp fiction aesthetic to them, which I really like.It's also notable that this is a surprisingly gory film. Oh sure, it's still pretty clean as far as the imagery goes, but it does take place during World War Two, which allows our shining squeaky clean hero to pick up a gun and start shooting enemies. Because they're Nazis. People can look dirty and disheveled, and so forth.Granted, I can see why so many people prefer the later MCU films. This is still pretty standalone, with a relatively modest budget. It doesn't have those layers of polish and sheer style that the later films have. Still, Steve Rogers is one of my favourite characters in the franchise, and this movie is largely to thank for that.Here's to you, Cap.",Null,2,2,30 October 2019
Captain America: The First Avenger," Beautiful origins story
","To me, both this and Thor feel a lot alike as movies. They're both movies about the main side characters of The Avengers film. Because lets face it, the main characters of The Avengers are Loki and Tony Stark. They're the heart and soul of the film, they're the driving force behind the plot and Tony's films are the ones that set the tone for the rest of the films. That's not to say that Captain America and Thor are not important characters, hence why they both got their own damn movies, which are both used to introduce plot points that would become important later on. With Thor we got Loki and with Captain America, we got the Tesseract.And yet, they're both very different experiences. Thor happens in the span of a few days, focuses on a single town, mostly, and the scope of its events is rather limited. It focuses more on the chemistry between its characters and the responsibility needed to be a leader. Only the last one of those is present in Captain America. In this movie we are pulled into the World War Two, the fate of the entire world is at stage and there's not a lot of character interactions going on. It's more about what needs to be done, not about how these two will get along as people. And don't get me wrong, both approaches are fine and I love Thor as a film, but I must admit that as a movie, this one is a bit stronger, just because it tells us more about both the character of Steve Rogers and about the rest of the world. It works both as an origins story and as a period piece about the war.The best thing about this film is by far Chris Evans. He plays his role perfectly, at first coming of as vulnerable yet determined scrawny kid, who wants to make a difference. You believe in his blight, trying to get enlisted, but just being too weak to be considered. But as soon as he steps out as Captain America, you'll buy it. He IS Captain America, his sheer presence just screams it at you.And I quite like the rest of the cast as well. Hugo Weaving has the slight problem of being too, well, Hugo Weaving, but that's what you get when you hire the man, and it's not like it's a bad performance. It's just a bit... campy, if you will.The plot itself would work just fine as a standalone film, but I like how tightly they bound it to the rest of the Marvel Cinematic Universe mythos, while still doing their own thing. You can see how the events of this film would affect the later events and would eventually lead to The Avengers. Though I must admit that the Hydra as the villain organization doesn't work quite as well as it could - I'm sorry Hugo, I know you're trying to be intimidating - but it's a nitpick at best.I like this film. It's one of the stronger Marvel films to date and I have high hopes for the sequels. It works both as a period film and as a superhero film and if you're a one of either, I'd give it a watch.",Null,1,4,5 October 2013
American Hustle," Great actors, uninteresting storyline
","When I walked in to see American Hustle, I expected to see a period piece with high stages, con artists, visually pleasing locations, beautiful women, handsome men, twists, plots, counterplots, bluffs and reveals, all that good stuff. Essentially a caper film with star studded cast.Well... I got some of that. It certainly wasn't what I was expecting. What I ended up getting can't really be called a caper film. Sure it has all the elements of one, but the tone, the focus and the way the story was told are all vastly different. It's more of a crime comedy-drama, which isn't a flaw per se, but it's something you need to take into account before you raise your expectations.The greatest strength of American Hustle is its cast. All the main actors are amongst Hollywood's finest and it shows. Christian Bale has once again undergone a mindboggling physical change and completely loses himself into the role of Irving Rosenfeld, a pudgy conman with 'an elaborate combover'. And the rest are equally as talented and they do have chemistry together.Unfortunately the plot leaves something to be desired. It's not bad, really. It's just that at the moment of writing this review, about a month after watching the film, I have difficulties remembering what the story was all about. There was something about a cop trying to bust some corrupt officials, something about a sheik, that one scene with Robert De Niro (easily the best one in the movie), some marital angst, Christian Bale showing off his beer belly... And that's about all I can remember. Not a very memorable movie, is what I'm saying. The film makers clearly had an idea they were going for. They were trying to shoot a bit more realistic caper film with heavy touches of unscrupulous humour, but they ended up juggling one ball too many and the whole thing lost its focus.Still, not a bad film and I'm pleased I saw it once. The productions values are really high, especially in the costuming department, the acting is topnotch and it managed to elicit a few laughs from me. If you can enjoy a movie simply for its charm and its characters, then this is an easy recommendation. But if you're looking for a clever plot with deep meanings, keep looking.",Null,0,1,1 April 2014
Incendies," That ending...
","Twins, who have just recently lost their mother, travel to Middle-East to search for their father, who they've believed dead, and their brother, who they didn't even now existed. At the same time we follow their mother in her youth in the middle of a bloody, religious civil war.I don't particularly care for Denis Villeneuve as a director. His scifi films, Blade Runner 2049 and Arrival, have both been decent, with the former edging into being downright good, but his more realistic drama films have always left me feeling unclean. Too much grittiness, too nasty a tone, too much needless misery, bleakness and depression. In Villeneuve's hands the world shows itself as a grey place, where even the most decent people hide monsters within and the only justification for existing is sheer lack of choices. Not something I want to subject myself to, if given a choice.That being said, this film works pretty well. Perhaps it's the background of war, but somehow Villeneuve's usual tricks didn't bother me as much. It's perhaps a bit weird that war is the justifier for all these horrible things, but the fact still remains that while it was still horrible, it didn't feel over-excessive.Except for that ending. I saw it coming. I saw it coming a long way ahead. How, you may ask. I simply imagined to most nasty turn the film could take. The one that would make me gag. And there it was. The worst part is that it doesn't even make sense within the film. The story has to bend over backwards for these events to take place and it completely shatters the suspension of disbelief. And for what? Did Villeneuve really want for his audience to throw up that badly?Then again, the film is very well done. The first half is told phenomenally well. The characters are interesting and the horrors of war are given their just due. It's just that ending...I think I'm done with this guy. Please, no more.",Null,0,2,26 February 2018
The Godfather: Part II," Deep dive into Michael Corleone's psyche
","The original Godfather was more about Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) than it was about Michael (Al Pacino), his son. Michael was the other main character certainly, but it was Vito's movie all around. In this sequel the roles are switched and while it's still about Vito, specifically about his youth, it's much more about Michael and his struggle with power, responsibility, pride and greed.The movie dances between two timelines, following both young Vito Corleone (Robert De Niro), and Michael as the new head of the Corleone family. The roles are also switched in that in the original film we followed the fall of an aging crime boss and the rise of a cunning mind in Vito and Michael, respectively. This time it's Vito that's rising to become the most feared and respected man in New York, whereas Michael is the one to suffer and watch as his life is torn down all around him.Superb storytelling from Francis Ford Coppola, and the main reason why this is such a beloved movie. In lesser hands all these separate strings, characters and plot points would have become a convoluted mess, but in Coppola's hands they weave a tapestry of corruption, personal glory and ruthless ambition. And while it is a requirement to have seen the original film, it in no way takes away from the saga. In truth these films should be regarded as one long experience.The secondary reason why these films work so well are of course the actors. Al Pacino once again gives us the performance of a century. He has moved from young man plagued by naivety, responsibility and obligation to a man burdened by expectations beyond any reason, inner struggles of family and endless ambition to prove himself worthy of his father's legacy. Robert De Niro as young Vito proves himself Pacino's equal. In him we get a character that's eerily similar to young Michael in intelligence, charisma and willingness to do what's necessary, but unlike his eventual son, this man isn't burdened by the expectations of larger society. He isn't an unreasonable man, but neither does he expect anything to be given to him if he isn't willing to take it by himself. Fantastic roles, both of them.The only flaw I can name in this film in comparison to the original is the multitude of plot point and story lines. I mentioned that in Coppola's hands they are not the disaster they would otherwise be, but that doesn't mean that the original movie isn't a purer, more streamlined experience. Though only in comparison. This film is still a masterpiece by any standards.",Null,2,2,11 July 2017
The Bourne Ultimatum," A few cracks, but overall solid
","The final piece in the original Bourne trilogy and the culmination of a story. Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) continues to unravel the mysteries of his past, digging deeper into Operation Treadstone, the program that created him. Unfortunately the program doesn't seem to be as dead as he has been led to believe.The Bourne Ultimatum is a solid crime action thriller. The character of Jason Bourne is once again beautifully realized by Matt Damon. I really like the way he can pull off these amazing action pieces and fight scenes, while still retaining that close to earth everyday guy vibe. It almost makes it seem like I could pull off these things, whereas someone like James Bond has always been much more a pleasant fantasy.Pamela 'Pam' Landy (Joan Allen) is also a welcome return, and she works as a great bridge between the movies, alongside Bourne himself. The film overall works the semi-ending of the second film beautifully into the narrative.Unfortunately that cannot be about the plot in general. The first two films had room to build the mythos, to leave things unresolved, to make allowances for mystery. Whereas this film tries to answer all the questions. And it feels forced. There are certain scenes, certain conversations between characters, that are purely there to nail down all the loose strings, even those that could have been allowed to leave hanging. The curtain is pulled back all the way and unfortunately the reality does not match our imagination.There's also way too much shaky-cam, which ruins the action scenes.Still, if you've liked the previous two, this is by no means a bad film. The characters are enjoyable, the initial plot is interesting - even if the execution could have been better - and it's a very professionally made piece of espionage entertainment.",Null,0,0,11 June 2018
Fargo," Dark comedy crime story
","An inept car salesman hires two thugs to kidnap his wife in order to get money from his rich father-in-law. Unfortunately he should have hired better thugs as they end up messing the whole thing up, which in turn causes the local law enforcement to become involved. From that setting we get a crime story worthy of being directed by the Coen brothers, full of awkward characters, everyday situations and hilariously dark scenes of blood, gore and rage.The two thugs, played by Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare, are what make this film work for me. Usually cinema tends to depict criminals as violent and lethal people, and these two are that as well, but usually these kinds of characters are not depicted to be quite so out of their depth. It is made clear very soon that while these two may have done these kinds of things before, neither is what you'd call the sharpest knife in the drawer. And they're both so idiotic in their own ways. It's fascinating to watch them live their miserable criminal lives and utterly failing at it. And yet they remain threatening throughout the entire film. Not because they're criminal masterminds, but because they're morons with no moral inhibitions.William H. Macy as Jerry Lundegaard, the car salesman, is also a fun character, who contrasts nicely with the two thugs. He's attempting to become a criminal, but he's even worse at it than his associates and every scene where he needs to pull off any kind conviction about his innocence is absolutely hilarious because¬Ö well, you can guess.Frances McDormand as Marge Gunderson, the Minnesotan police chief in charge of investigations, has also received a lot of praise for her work. Personally I found her to be a touch boring, though I do admit that my expectations we're a bit too high. She's just so utterly chipper and optimistic all the time that it seems unrealistic. It's a nice contrast to her opponents, but it still means that I didn't find her that interesting. Still, I do like her character on a conceptual basis, and the performance itself is objectively fine. Not just my personal cup of tea.All in all Fargo is a nice watch if you're into dark comedy and can laugh at people being dismembered and people giving into their nefarious impulses. If you've liked any of the other Coen films, you're going to like this one as well.",Null,0,0,12 January 2016
Rush," Way more than just a Formula 1 sports film
","I liked this film a lot more than I would have anticipated. Sure I knew going in that the two main leads were both brilliant actors - Hemsworth especially has become a recent favourite of mine - but they both exceeded my wildest expectations. They became James Hunt (Hemsworth) and Niki Lauda (Daniel Br√ºhl), down to the smallest of detail, the most delicate of nuance. The 1976 racing season was before my time, but even though I'm just a casual Formula 1 fan, I had heard about it and I knew who these two were. They were such large characters, such giants in their chosen field, that had this film not captured them perfectly, it wouldn't have been half as good as it is now. Luckily Howard's directing and the performances of these two are some of the finest I've seen in a long time.I also really like the fact that Rush is more than just a sports film about racing. It's a character study about two masters of their craft, embedded in deep rivalry. Both of them know that they stand unopposed, except for that one man, who's their polar opposite in both personality and driving style, yet who is just as capable. That's a great setting for a movie and Rush beautifully explores the possibilities given to it. You buy the rivalry and by the time of the final race I found myself at the edge of my seat, even though I already knew the outcome.It's also great how the movie never takes sides. It's not a film about Niki Lauda - even though he was involved in its making - nor is it about James Hunt. It's about them both and about the sport as a whole.To sum it up, I'd say this is the best sports movie I've seen in my life. But it's that because it's more than a simple example of its genre. It's a brilliant character study, an interesting period piece, a gripping drama and yes, at its core, a film with furiously fast cars. Highly recommended.",Null,3,3,18 March 2014
Predator," A perfect mix of Alien, Commando and Rambo
","This, my friends, is a silly action/scifi film done correctly. Because let's face it, the idea behind this film is ridiculous. A team of black ops commandos being double-crossed by their own government is pretty basic, but when you throw in an alien big game hunter, the silliness levels skyrocket instantly. Sure the alien in question is kind of cool and dodges most of the worst clic√©s, but it's still an alien trying to hunt down Arnold Schwarzenegger, for sport. I still can't believe that this movie didn't fail.And it doesn't. This movie is a fantastic action film, with intense battle scenes, memorable characters and pacing that keeps you on the edge of your seat from start to finish. It's smooth, gritty and knows what it's doing. It treats its characters and plot points with respect, yet never forgets what it truly is. The balance between realism and silliness is as thin as a knife, yet this movie walks it perfectly.There's really not all that much more that can be said about this film. It requires you to suspense your disbelief, sure, but when the whole movie just works, you can easily do so. In my opinion, one of the best Arnold Schwarzenegger action movies out there and easily worth watching by everyone that enjoys combat, slaughter and tough-as-nails characters.",Null,1,2,20 July 2012
L√©on: The Professional," Classic for a reason
","Action movie filmed using art house film techniques. As much art as it is enjoyment. Each scene carefully crafted to place both the eye as well as the need for action. A tale about an orphaned girl, Mathilda (Natalie Portman), who happens to fall under the wing of a seasoned yet somewhat simple-minded assassin, L√©on (Jean Reno). From there, an unexpected friendship blooms.What I like the most is the atmosphere. The world of this film is cruel. Officials are corrupt, you cannot trust your own parents, everyone is willing to look the other way and as a whole there's not much hope to be had. Yet the film's tone doesn't reflect that. Many of its scenes are lighthearted, perhaps a bit naive, but ultimately optimistic. In a lesser film this dichotomy would bother me, but here it works. Its part of the message, that there are pockets of goodness to be found, that not all bad men are evil, just like not all so called angels are good.The camera-work is also excellent, the pacing flawless and the characters are interesting. I must admit that I didn't find the story to be as captivating as I was led to believe, but I blame the hype, not the movie. The ending was also somewhat of a letdown, but it just means it wasn't my cup of tea, not that there was anything wrong with it.L√©on is classic for a reason and rightfully considered to be Luc Besson's masterpiece. Worth a watch for all that are looking for an action movie with a soul.",Null,3,5,21 April 2015
Oblivion," Surprisingly decent scifi film
","I didn't go into Oblivion with high hopes. Granted I had already seen Edge of Tomorrow, which was decent Tom Cruise film, but then again I had also seen War of the Worlds, which was awful. But, Oblivion managed to surprise me. Not only was Tom Cruise well-suited for the role as a lone technician, looking for meaning in an abandoned world, but the whole film was beautifully designed, the story was interesting if a bit clich√©d, and as a whole I was entertained from start to finish.The best part of the movie is how it looks. The whole abandoned Earth and the giant machines that scourge its surface to fund humanity's reach for the stars look majestic and the white, sleek designs of the few stations left are beautiful to look at. It has that 00s iPod design vibe to it, but in this film it fits, because the whole landscape supports it with it bleakness.Furthermore, Andrea Riseborough and Tom Cruise have good chemistry together as the two technicians tasked to look after the machines, and while I do think Morgan Freeman was criminally underutilized, it's always a joy to see him any film.The story is a bit clich√©d, as I already said, and the end is a bit preachy, going over the same ground every single one of these movies does, but it's told well with good action, well-timed twists and good pacing in general. Enough time is given for the simple appreciation of how the film looks, the dialogues flow smoothly and the only real thing missing is that spark of originality that would have made this a great film instead of 'merely' good.Oblivion is well worth a watch if you're looking for a decent scifi film with excellent, innovative set designs and a plot that will keep you interested.",Null,0,0,3 June 2015
Burn After Reading," Farcical drama
","'What have we learned from this?' 'I have no idea, sir.'That pretty much sums up this movie, directed by the Coen brothers and featuring an all-star cast, including George Clooney, John Malkovich and Brad Pitt to name a few. The movie starts with Malkovich's character Osborne Cox retiring from CIA and deciding to write his memoirs. We get introduced to his family and friends, plus a couple of other characters from a local gym, and then... complications ensue. That's pretty much the only way I can describe the plot without giving anything away. I'd like to say that it's typical Coen wackiness with many complicated twists and turns, but even for them this is out there.It honestly feels like a total mess, but it feels like a purposeful mess. It's complicated, but it's never hard to follow. It's unrealistic, but still plausible. It's weird, but that's what makes it interesting. You never quite know where the story will go next and when it starts throwing curve balls at you, you're both shocked and pleasantly surprised.I also really like all the characters. They feel like movie characters in that they're very clear cut and a bit larger than life, yet their struggles feel real and you get their blights. Pretty much none of them is all that likable and those that are still do some questionable things, but they're sympathetic beneath all their misnomers.It's also a very funny movie. Most of the humour comes from the absurdity of the situation and the desperation of the characters. They're all tragic personas, but in a way that's more amusing than it's depressing.Definitely worth seeing if you like Coen brothers, crime comedies or farcical dramas.",Null,0,1,2 February 2014
The Bourne Identity," Solid action entertainment
","The Bourne Identity succeeds where many action films fail in that it keeps its action grounded yet entertaining. There are no huge explosions or entire city blocks being leveled just for the sake of looking cool and pandering to the action junkies among the viewers. Suffice to say it'd be more accurate to call this film an action thriller as far as mood and style go.And it's a really good action thriller. The mystery of Jason Bourne's (Matt Damon) memory loss is interesting, the locations are varied, the characters and their actors do a credible job of pulling us into their world, the action feels suitably heavy and threatening and as a whole the story is told well, with captivating pacing.I also really like Matt Damon and Franka Potente together in this film. They have instant chemistry together, but it's never overplayed. They get to know each other along the way, but always at the terms of the larger action taking place around them. This feels more realistic than many other action couples where they seem ready to jump each other's bones at a moment's notice.As a whole The Bourne Identity is a peculiar action classic. It's downplayed and even minimalistic, but it's shot and told so well that even hardcore action fans won't complain. Easily worth a watch.",Null,0,1,12 June 2014
The Italian Job," Gets the job done
","The Italian Job is a 21st century remake of a 1969 British caper film starring Michael Caine. And they certainly didn't pull any punches with this one. It stars Mark Wahlberg, Charlize Theron, Edward Norton, Jason Statham, Donald Sutherland, Seth Green, Mos Def and so many others. This is what I think of when the term ensemble film is mentioned.The plot goes that a team of criminals get betrayed by one of their own. They barely survive and vow revenge. Time pass and they manage to locate their betrayer. And now it's up to them to pull a heist against one of their own to get their loot back. It's workable, if not particularly inspired.And that's probably the biggest problem with this film. It's workmanlike. Everything in it is as it should be, but at the same time it's very formulaic and nothing new is really added to the tired and old clich√©s.That being said, it's a fun film to watch. All the actors are clearly having fun with it. Most notably Seth Green, who's having an absolute blast with every scene he's in. Edward Norton is as great as ever, although the script doesn't give him much to work with. I do hope they had given the main characters, mainly Wahlberg and Theron, a bit more to chew, but as I've said: workmanlike.The Italian Job is a great watch if you're a fan of caper films. If you're not, it's still a relatively short, breezy film that's sure to keep you entertained.",Null,0,0,8 April 2020
Baby Driver," The least comedic of Edgar Wright films
","Quite often when a director is said to have a style, it is meant as a derogatory comment. Like that style keeps the director from focusing on supposedly worthier aspects of film. This is often the criticism aimed at Quentin Tarantino, for example. But I don't agree with that. Style is what gives films their identity. It's what you remember when you have forgotten the names of the characters, or the exact twists of the plot, or lines of dialogue. You remember the imagery, the mood, the atmosphere. And in that quite few directors can compete with Edgar Wright.Baby Driver is a great film to watch as an audiovisual experience alone, without even going into the story and the characters at all. Wright experiments with the camera and the shots constantly, giving us some real eye candy and some of the best car chases in decades. The story of course going that Baby (Ansel Elgort) is the hottest getaway driver in town, even with his idiosyncrasies, like listening to music all the time or being something of an oddball socially. Music overall is a huge theme in the movie and many of the scenes are set to actual tracks of music, from Queen to Barry White and from Bob & Earl to Simon & Garfunkel.The acting is also topnotch. Elgort is by far the most untested of the illustrious lot, but he performs beautifully, giving us a lovable main character with quirks and twists. Someone who can veer from crime to justice and make it believable. Kevin Spacey as his main employer is also great casting and the rest of his crew is also littered with great actors and performances.But even with all that this is still nowhere near as good as the Cornetto Trilogy, in my opinion. And I think the reason for that is the fact that this is not as comedic. It's not really a comedy at all, unlike all those three films. It has comedic moments in it, but overall it tries to be a straightforward action blast. The problem with that is that the plot is still so convoluted and bizarre that it kind of needs the be a comedy in order for you to accept it. The film blazes onward with full throttle all the time and the fatigue sets in near the start of the third act. At which point you stop caring. For me personally, the first act was amazing. Great scenes, great chases, great music. The second wasn't as good, but it deepened the characters and set the stakes. But then the third act tries to go out all guns blazing, but aside from Baby, you haven't formed enough of a connection to any of the characters to care.But, let's not think that this means the film is not worth a watch. No, by no means no. It's still an amazing film on many levels. It's simply not as good as some of Wright's other films. But that's a high bar indeed to reach. What Baby Driver has is style in abundance, great main character, great music and the best car chases you've seen in years. What it lacks a little bit is a tighter storyline. But that's it.",Null,0,1,19 August 2017
Justice League," What even is this?
","So, an alien from outer space slash other dimension has arrived to Earth, seeking a cube-shaped thing of power, bringing with him an army of insectoid people. A grumpy, slightly older man dressed all in black has to gather together a group of superheroes in order to face this threat. But can they stand together or will their internal squabbling tear the group apart? What movie is this?If you answered The Avengers... well, right there is your problem. DC's Justice League is almost an insult. It's not like DC hasn't tried to emulate Marvel before with their films, but this right here is so blatant that it has to be deliberate. I mean, couldn't the MacGuffin have been at least some other shape? Every single viewer is going to be thinking of the Tesseract, so why even go there. You're doing yourself no favours with such a move.Aside from that the film suffers mostly from the same problems as the other DC movies, with the exception of Wonder Woman. Too much, too soon, with too many characters. With The Avengers we already knew all of the key players. With Justice League we know Batman, Superman and Wonder Woman, but the characters of Flash, Cyborg and Aquaman are completely new to us. Aside from that brief cameo by Flash in Batman v Superman, but that was exactly like I said: brief.This means that this film has to introduce three whole new characters in its run time. Four, actually, if you count the villain. At least with The Avengers we already knew Loki. Thanos was a new one, but he was more of a puppet master behind the scenes and not the primary antagonist of the film. And I'm sorry, for a movie such as this, four new characters is too much. Something has to give.Not helping the matters is the fact that the film doesn't look great. Almost all of the backgrounds are CGI and it shows. I've seen better graphics in video games that are almost a decade old. The action scenes are choreographed somewhat decently, but once again I find it hard to get invested when I don't really know any of the players.DC is in too much of a hurry. Marvel has proven that the superhero craze is not going anywhere for the time being. They could have easily given all of these characters their standalone movie and then went ahead with the Justice League. This is too much, too soon, and quite frankly watching it made me angry.",Null,1,3,5 October 2018
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," The fantasy movie
","A lot has been said about The Fellowship of the Ring over the years. It was a cultural phenomenon unlike few others at its release. People talked about it for years before it even came out. There was a lot of hype, a lot of buzz. And it earned it. This movie changed cinema. It paved way for a whole plethora of fantasy movies. It's quite likely that the current superhero craze would not have happened had this movie not shown that people cared about make-belief, care about escapism into a foreign and strange world, filled with magic and wonder.It truly is a wonderful movie. There will doubtlessly be other adaptations of J. R. R. Tolkien's magnum opus in the years to come. We can only hope that whoever they end getting to direct, will love the world of Middle-Earth as much as Peter Jackson does.Because that's why these movies are so good, why this movie won us over almost instantly. It's not the huge budget, or the talented actors, or even the majestic landscapes of New Zealand. Although they do help. A lot. But in the end it's the hours put in. All the tiniest details that someone included, not because they absolutely had to, but because they wanted to make it as perfect as possible. Because they care about this world, about this story.The Lord of the Rings has now shaped multiple generations. It has shaped how we think about stories. It's definitely one of my favourite books ever written and this one is definitely one of my favourite movies ever made. Not because it's the perfect adaptation. Or the perfect movie. It's neither. There are things changed, which I wish were not. The storytelling has its hiccups. But those don't matter. Because at its heart this movie is in the right. It cares about what it is, what it represents. About what it's telling us. What kind of a story it is.And it is for that reason that I love this movie so much.",Null,0,0,12 January 2019
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Pure fantasy
","J. R. R. Tolkien changed literature with his trilogy The Lord of the Rings. A new genre was created practically from nothing. Owing much to fairy tales and epics of old, yet still being something new, fantasy soon captured the imaginations of generation after another. The Lords of the Rings was written as a myth, as an epic, a tale about the struggle against ancient, undying evil. In it great warrior kings and armies of legend fought for the control of Middle-Earth against armies of darkness, filled with hordes of orcs, goblins and trolls. Yet it was a small, insignificant being, a hobbit from the Shire, that would decide their fate through his deeds.Since then this story has influenced pretty much every single author that has come after it. Naturally, a movie adaptation was going to be made at some point, but for the longest time people in the business thought it couldn't be done. You needed to introduce a whole new world, including back stories that could fill whole shelves with books and tomes. The amount of characters alone would make it cumbersome. Without even mentioning the special effects needed. But, finally in the late 90s, movie technology had advanced enough that you could theoretically pull it off. And so Peter Jackson accepted the challenge and in the process created a movie trilogy that affected cinema almost as profoundly as the original book trilogy had affected literature.All three The Lord of the Rings movies are fantastic, but if I had to name my favourite, it'd be this one, no doubt. Not because it's the most direct or has the most flowing narrative. Quite the opposite. The first one contains the most story, has the most detail, jumps around the most. And yet it succeeds in pulling you in. I had read the books numerous times before this movie came out. I knew how much sheer information Jackson had to convey in this first film. I had my doubts. But, the thing is, it's beautiful. From the very first chord of music, from the very first lines of dialogue, from the very first scene of the rings being forged, you're in Middle-Earth. There's just no other way to say it. There's movies capture the essence of Tolkien's original books nigh perfectly.For those that read this and have yet to see this film - yes, all three or four of you - know that this is my second favourite film of all time. It is a fantasy film unlike any other, a tale almost without equal. It is the courage and nobility of men distilled into story form. It is The Lord of the Rings.",Null,0,0,14 September 2015
Man of Steel," The tone is too dark, but the actions scenes are epic
","The thing about this movie is that at its heart it doesn't feel like a Superman movie. Man of Steel has often been accused of trying to emulate The Dark Knight when it doesn't need to, and yeah, there's some truth to that. The mood and the tone are both a lot grittier and more somber, which gives strength to the accusations. And I cannot lie and say that I wouldn't have preferred a more upbeat reboot to the Superman franchise, although that's just my personal preference. For me Batman is the gritty, dark superhero and Superman is the boyscout. When I want to see a nice, positive superhero story I go to Superman and vice versa.However, many have voiced a reasonable argument that trying to force a character into such a tight mold does them no justice and that we should allow this variety into our beloved superheros. I cannot argue about that, because it's true. The tone of this film is not one I prefer, but it's something I can accept and that does work if you let it.Furthermore, Henry Cavill is a great Superman. He has the correct build for the role, which is important when you have to spend a significant amount of your screen time in skintight latex. He also has the looks and the quiet confidence needed to make a believable Superman. I wouldn't mind him reprising his role in future installations at all.I also quite like Russell Crowe as Jor-El, but the rest of the characters felt a bit flat to me. Amy Adams as Lois Lane was an especially weird addition to the film, because her character did nothing of importance. Her character could have been cut out of the film entirely and nothing would have changed. She was there just because it was a Superman film and of course a Superman film needs to have Lois Lane in it. This was a terrible decision and quite honestly lowered the film's quality.So we have Lois Lane that does nothing, but we also have Jonathan Kent (Kevin Costner) that does too much, repeating the same speech over and over. Yes, we get it, Clark has a responsibility, he has a destiny to fulfill. We heard you the first time.Shaky cam is also a big problem. Is it really too much to ask for the camera not to move when two characters are sitting completely still, just having a conversation? It's distracting to constantly be aware of the movement of the camera. Enough, film makers. Enough. It's a neat little gimmick that has its places, but... enough.Still, I cannot claim that I didn't enjoy large parts of this film. The film as a whole looks great, despite shaky cam. The colours are stark and beautiful, the angles and cinematography are great and the action scenes have real weight behind them. If you wandered in just looking for a summer blockbuster with big, epic action scenes, you got your money's worth.In the end I'm torn about this film. I didn't like some of the characters at all, I felt that the tone was off and that this would have worked better with a different storyline, but I also quite liked the main lead, the action scenes and some of the dialogues. So I guess I'd call this average. If you're open to seeing a new kind of Superman, you might like this very much. If you're a Superman purist, I'd stay away from this one.",Null,0,1,11 January 2014
Grease," Tale as old as the 20th century

Both the main leads are unbelievably charismatic, despite Newton-John being thirty years old - yeah, I find it hard to believe as well - and even Travolta being well over twenty. But they make up for it in chemistry, great song numbers and good old-fashioned charm. The music is also great. Greased Lightnin', Summer Nights and You're the One That I Want defined a whole generation. Sure, not all of them, like Beauty School Dropout, are all that memorable and some, like Summer Nights, contain somewhat sexist lyrics, but overall the songs are great and the whole film has this energy to it.Grease defines the word fun.

28 Weeks Later," Leaves something to be desired
","As the name suggests, months have passed since the catastrophic events of the first film. But now the infected, the Ragers, have died of starvation and the British Isles are slowly being re-inhabited. But, of course it's not that simple.I thought the first film was okay. Not great, but okay. It had some really good action and the zombies - or the Ragers, because none of these movies dare use the Z-word - were an actual, legitimate threat. It had some social commentary, some good acting and a decent ending.I also like the idea of this film franchise on paper. Examining the same zombie outbreak in its different stages. First some days later, then weeks, and then presumably months or even years. 28 Years Later could be something we've never seen before in this genre.Unfortunately it's unclear whether this sequel is strong enough to warrant a third movie. Because while it keeps some of the strengths of the original - the scary zombies and the social commentary - it just isn't that strong of a movie by itself. The action especially takes a heavy nosedive. The film seems to think that the way to shoot action is to have the whole screen pitch black and then flash the lights every couple of seconds while people grunt and moan in the dark. As you can probably imagine, this makes all the action scenes nigh impossible to follow or appreciate.The whole film also has this cold, clinical look to it. I remember the first film looking much warmer, like a real civilization in ruins. This looks like an IKEA catalog with some zombies added.Not a terrible film by any means, and if you liked the first one, then this might be worth a watch. Here's hoping we get a third one and that it picks up the slack.",Null,2,2,1 May 2019
Cast Away," Must see survival film
","A film that would be nothing without a powerhouse actor like Tom Hanks. Let's see, this is a film where a single man gets stranded on a deserted island and most of the film's running time is nothing but him talking with himself. No big emotional speeches, barely no action, no real climax - the movie kind of just ends on a mystery, but in a good way - and very little dialogue compared to other recent movies. And it pulls it off, if only barely in certain parts.Tom Hanks is the saving grace of this film. He is charismatic enough to fill the screen with his presence and is able to convey a lot of themes and emotions without talking, which makes the movie enjoyable to watch. Still, the deserted island part of this film is its weakest. I enjoyed both the beginning and the end a lot more than I did the part where he's just going through the known motions of surviving on a deserted island. Yes, some of that stuff is creative, like the reuse of skates for various tasks, and the 'character' of Wilson adds a touch of both humour and drama into the scenes. Still, Hanks' character Chuck Noland is an interesting guy and he's opening speech at the beginning of the film easily both sets the character, arouses our interest and gives a lot of room for growth, not all of which gets explored. The island was an important lesson for him, but it was more of a necessary evil, if you ask me.That being said, it's a strong movie. The film makers went the extra mile to give it nice little finishing touches that lift it above its peers and make it film worth watching. Definitely recommended.",Null,3,4,16 June 2013
The Thing," Masterful horror
","The movie opens to a frozen wasteland of Antarctica, as we spot the lonely figure of a dog fleeing from its pursuers. It's a bleak, unforgiving setting and a perfect opener to this movie. The Thing, based on John W. Campbell Jr.'s novella Who Goes There? is one of the finest horror movies ever made. In a way it reminds me a lot of Alien, another masterpiece of horror. They both have an isolated setting where no help will be forthcoming, they both feature an attack by an unknown alien entity and they both have unbelievably good special effects, the sheer brutality, goriness and impossibility of which are the stuff of nightmares.The Thing adds the fact that its alien is capable of assuming other shapes, and the movie evolves to a tense hide and seek game and as the pressure rises, the group of scientists and researchers starts to crack. It's an intense experience with long scenes of unbearable atmosphere followed by short bursts of soul-chilling terror facilitated by the special effects of one Rob Bottin, a master of his craft.It's a well-told story, ending on a perfect note that isn't too uplifting, but neither is it a complete downer. Easily one of the best endings to a horror film I've ever seen and the rest of the story is told equally as well. Perhaps my only nitpick is that some of the characters and their actors aren't as strong as, say, in the Alien. There's perhaps one or two too many for all of them to get enough screen time to really shine. On the other hand, some are really good, like Kurt Russell's MacReady or Wilford Brimley's Dr. Blair.This is a movie that every fan of horror owes to himself or herself to see at least once. Its special effects are so scary that I actually wouldn't recommend this to anyone who's prone to nightmares. They're not nice to look at, they're not pleasant and under no circumstances should any child ever see this film. It's that frightening, that good at what it does.",Null,9,11,29 December 2013
Lilo & Stitch," One of the best films Disney has made in decades
","Lilo & Stitch is something of an oddball for a Disney film. After Emperor's New Groove and Atlantis had failed to bring in the kind of money needed to make them successful, Lilo & Stitch was given a much smaller budget, but also a lot more freedom when it came to story and style. The end result is something you almost wouldn't recognize as a Disney film if you didn't know better. But I mean that in a good way.The story goes that an extra-terrestrial space government sentences a dangerous lifeform simply known as Experiment 626 to an exile on a lonely asteroid. Unfortunately, or fortunately depending on the point of view, the lifeform, about to be known as Stitch, escapes and ends up in Hawaii on planet Earth. There he meets a little native girl known as Lilo, who ends up adopting him as her new 'dog'. The story shifts between the two story lines about Stitch being hunted by the space government and Lilo being potentially taken away by social workers because her parents have died and her sister is struggling to take care of her.The plot alone would make this an intriguing film, but what really makes this such a wonderful movie is its warmth and maturity. Nani, Lilo's older sister, is not a bad person, despite being unable to take care of her sister properly. Instead she's shown as being a very brave young woman who has been pushed into an impossible situation. I like the maturity that shows on the film makers's part a lot. Lilo and Stitch are also very good characters, shifting effortlessly between typical Disney antics and surprising bouts of tangible maturity.The story itself is rather basic, given the ludicrous setting. Nothing all that surprising or unexpected happens, but it doesn't have to. It's not that kind of film. It's a film you see for the characters and the emotions. For the message. And all those are spot on.I also really like the visuals. It's not animated in the usual Disney style, but you can see enough of it for it to feel familiar. And all the new stuff being brought in works very well for the film's advantage, giving it a lot of energy and soul. Sure, it's not on bar with, say, Tarzan or Sleeping Beauty in terms of animation, but given the small budget, I'm more than impressed. The score is also nice, featuring songs by Elvis in addition to some new songs that evoke the feel of Hawaii.This is a great film no matter how you look at it. Its heart and warmth will stay with you for a long time and it was one of the first signs that Disney could still make great films even in the new century. See it, if you haven't already.",Null,0,0,3 January 2016
The Revenant," The art of suffering, pain and loss
","Alejandro G. I√±√°rritu has always been a bit of hit and miss director for me. I've always admired his vision, his willingness to push the art form and his unmistakable style. But his stories and characters have always left me wanting, just a little bit. They've always felt like they're experiments first and fulfilling experiences second.Not so with this film. This film blew me away from the very first second and simply get blowing. The vast cold landscape of Northern USA opens in front of your eyes in rich shades of dark brown, grey and green. No artificial lighting was used to film this epic and yet it's all so rich and detailed, and all the more real for it. And the camera-work is equally as impressive. It moves seamlessly with the character, sweeping low and high as needed, like on wings. And it's not afraid to hold a shot. There are a lot of long takes, like you, the viewer, are part of the story and cautiously approaching certain scenes and sights, afraid of what you'll find. Visually one of the most impressive and beautiful films I've seen in a long while.The story is somewhat loosely based on the real life events that took place in the early 1800s. Hugh Glass (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a fur trapper and a scout working for a trapper company led by Captain Andrew Henry (Domhnall Gleeson). The company is forced to flee after being ambushed by Native Americans, but in the midst of their flight Glass is savagely mauled by a mother bear and shortly after left for dead by John Fitzgerald (Tom Hardy), a trapper very much interested in his own personal survival. The film then follow Glass's slow and painful journey across the wilderness as he tries to reach this one man, who condemned him to a cold death in the middle of nowhere.DiCaprio won his first Academy Award for this role and I say it's well-earned. He spends much of the film mutely struggling to put one foot in front of the other, erratically interrupted by stilled grunts of pain, but yet you still know exactly what's playing in his mind with every step. The feelings of betrayal and need for vengeance, the flickering and undying spark of life, the resolve to never stop moving. It's all there, behind his eyes, across his stained and bloodied face.Not to say that the rest of the cast in in any way untalented, but it's very much DiCaprio's show. And when he finally reaches the end of his journey and locks eyes with his quarry. A chilling moment.It's not a film for everyone. It very much earns its R rating, containing strong and disturbing scenes. But it's beautiful in execution, from the visuals to the acting to the music and the story. Very much my favourite movie thus far from 2015.",Null,0,3,2 June 2016
Pitch Black," Are you afraid of the dark?
","Pitch Black is the first film in the so called Riddick saga, featuring Vin Diesel as the titular main character, Richard B. Riddick, and David Twohy as director slash producer. The films are noted for their dark aesthetic and their focus on an almost unlikable antihero, who nevertheless manages to garner your sympathy and support.And as far as debut films go, I've seen far worse. It's a niche scifi film that chooses to focus on a small crew of survivors stranded on a desert planet where night is fast approaching and hunters eagerly await the fall of darkness. No one has a clear idea of what to do and now they have a certified killer, Riddick, on the loose.Where the film shines is the execution of its main idea. Its modest budget is very well utilized and the character roster is a strong one. Diesel's Riddick has gathered a cult following, but I also really liked Radha Mitchell as Carolyn Fry, the leader of the survivors.The film also uses lighting amazingly. The title of the film refers to a long action set piece near the end of the film where the characters have wade through literal pitch black darkness while avoiding attacks and pursuit. And it is a glorious scene. One of the best of its kind.I wouldn't call Pitch Black anything groundbreaking, but it has enough style and substance to stand on its own feet and withstand the ravages of time.

American Psycho," Look into a dark psyche
","American Psycho, based on a novel of the same name by Bret Easton Ellis, is a story of Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale), an investment banker on the Wall Street, whose life revolves around a few things. Looking good, one-upping his coworkers and listening to music. Only, he does all of these things in the most destructive, psychotic and capitalistic way possible. The movie is nothing if not a look into the psyche of a seriously disturbed man, who also happens to stand in for the rottenness of modern society.Most of the good things in the film can be summed up in two words: Christian Bale. One of the defining roles of his career, and the man absolutely nails the outwardly pleasant high-lifer, who nonetheless has the eyes of a dead man. Whenever he smiles it sends shivers down your spine because even though it looks alright, there's something messed up behind it. And then there are those scenes where his inner psycho comes out to play. Freaky stuff.Not that the other aspect of film making are lacking. It's a well-shot, well-acted, well-made film all around. But it's really Bale's performance that elevates this above the crowd. Well, that and the themes explored, but there are other films that have dealt with similar issues equally well, if not better.A movie well worth a watch. Not for the squeamish, but if you can stomach it, it's a fascinating journey down the looney highway.",Null,0,0,24 January 2020
American Psycho," Psychotic charisma
","A film everyone knows to at least exist. A film that is said to capture the ugly underbelly of modern society, of modern America. And, in a way, it does just that. Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale) is a horrible human being. He's man obsessed with style, fashion, appearances, pop culture, sex and looking good in front of the crowds, a flawed human being that we all want to be. We all want to be him because he's rich, successful, extremely good looking and sexually active. He's everything we are told to be and everything we want to be, in our darkest dreams.This is a brutally honest film. It's very direct, very straight to the point and it has a clear message: modern society is obsessed and its obsession is not productive. This single point is supported by a clear vision from the director, an amazing acting talent from Bale and a story that has no wasted motions, no wasted scenes. It's all a single, flawless trip through a flawed wasteland that is a modern day utopia.A lot has been written about the ending. Some say it's just perfect, some that it's hard to understand, some that it could have been better, some that it ruins the whole film and some that it's the single flaw in a perfect film. I tend to think that the whole film is about the aimlessness of modern day society, about the meaninglessness of living in a society this obsessed with appearances. So why shouldn't the ending be just as meaningless? Still, it's a pretty jarring ending that will alienate at least half of the viewers, which is never a good thing. It could have been better, in my opinion.This is a fascinating film. It's brutal, it's stylistic, it's honest, it's confusing, it's slick, it's jarring, it's an experience worth having.",Null,0,0,13 June 2013
Little Miss Sunshine," Comedy drama about a horribly dysfunctional family
","Little Miss Sunshine is one of those comedies where most of the time you feel like you shouldn't be laughing at it. It creates this unclean feeling in you yet it's clearly supposed to be entertainment.It all starts with the characters. You have the father (Greg Kinnear), an unsuccessful motivational speaker. The brother (Paul Dano), who has taken up a vow of silence, following the teachings of Nietzsche. The uncle (Steve Carell), a suicidal gay man, who used to be an appreciated professor. The grandfather (Alan Arkin), who cares little about anything but porn. And lastly the eponymous Little Miss Sunshine (Abigail Breslin), a pudgy nerdy beauty pageant applicant. Only the mother (Toni Collette) is in any way normal, which is good, because she provides much needed balance to this mix of weird and unsettling characters.Little Miss Sunshine works because and despite of its crazy character largely because it has such great actors capable of pulling it off. Steve Carell and Alan Arkin especially shine in their roles and manage to provide many of the best jokes. But because the characters are so brutally broken, it'd be hard to call Little Miss Sunshine just a comedy. It is that, don't get me wrong, there are laughs to be had, but there are also really dark and depressing scenes... which are then played for laughs. The end result is something of a mix between the two genres and it adds an additional layer of depth to otherwise relatively normal road trip comedy.I'd also dare to guess that the humour is not for everyone. Most of the jokes are somewhat mean-spirited in nature or they laugh at things that in a drama would be easy tear-jerkers. Olive's performance at the beauty pageant near the end especially exemplifies this idea. It's sort of a train wreck of comedy scenes. It's so horrible, so wrong, but you can't look away. And the more you look at it, the funnier it becomes. And that perfectly sums up Little Miss Sunshine.",Null,0,0,3 April 2014
North by Northwest," Surprisingly cheerful for a Hitchcock film
","If you had to name Alfred Hitchcock's two most influential films, you could not go wrong with Vertigo and Psycho. Both are dark psychological thrillers that delve deep into the human psyche, in which you can trust no one or anything, and even though, according to the customs of the time, the good guys win in the end, they're not what we would call clean victories.North by Northwest happens to be the film Hitchcock filmed in between these two monoliths. And it's clear he had decided that he needed a break, because by his standards this is almost a holiday film. But, it's still very much a Hitchcock film. The camerawork is superb and rather noticeable, but in a good way. The characters have that Hitchcock feel to them. And the plot is still a mystery story.But somehow it feels more lighthearted than usual. And I think it is the dialogue that's to blame. Plus the music that's almost frivolous in tone. This is a spy thriller where gorgeous men and women exchange witty one-liners over martini glasses, the villains twirl their mustaches and the death traps defy all expectations. It is almost like a proto Roger Moore James Bond film, over a decade in advance.And yet it is a Hitchcock film, with all the goodies that usual implies. Aside from the nail-biting corkscrew of piling tension, that is. Is it his best film? Nah, but it's a breath of fresh air if you've watched a whole bunch of his films and want something a bit lighter, but still in the same style.",Null,0,1,3 December 2018
Hugo," Visually pleasing movie with clever details
","The movie is very nice to look at, let's start from that. I saw the movie in 3D, and while it didn't add anything significant to the movie it didn't detract from it like it does in so many other films. Would I have preferred 2D had it been available? Yes, but mainly because I'm one of those guys, who gets a headache from 3D glasses. For most of the people, I think that this movie is finally one of those that are actually enhanced by the 3D effect. But, no matter the amount of dimensions, the movie looks great. The costumes, the details, the backgrounds, the people, they're all wonderful to look at.Unfortunately the visual effects are the best part of the movie. Nothing in it is bad, far from it, but nothing is as masterful as the visuals. The ensemble cast of high-quality actors all played their parts brilliantly, but I never felt quite connected to the characters. They were all unique, well-rounded and sympathetic, yet that extra little spark was missing. The same can be said about the story. It hit all the right notes, was interesting and had absolutely no plot holes or unnecessary scenes. And yet I don't think that I'll remember any of it after five years.But movie isn't bad, not at all. The amazing visuals kind of overwhelm the other aspects of it, but it was still enjoyable to watch. I especially liked all those little moments where they replicated a scene from an old black and white film that they had shown within the movie earlier. All in all it's a nice movie and a brilliant love letter to the movie industry in general. Is it Scorsese's strongest work? Not even close, but it's definitely worth a watch for any fan of movies out there.",Null,6,8,16 March 2012
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," Doesn't match it predecessors, but a good action film nonetheless
","The first Terminator film is a classic example of an intense action/horror scifi film done just right. Everything is perfect from the bleak setting to the depressing storyline about a future where the machines have taken over and their only salvation is to try and mess with time itself. The second film, also directed by James Cameron, was more of a straight-up action film, but just as great as the original, if not even a bit better. And then there's the third one.It's not as good as the first two. The lack of James Cameron shows in the lack of vision. It's not as ambitious as the first two, the actors aren't as talented - Schwarzenegger though once again shines in his trademark role, though nothing new about him is uncovered - and the story tries to patch some of the plot holes of the previous movies, but only manages to create new ones in their stead. Even the character of John Connor, played by Nick Stahl, the centerpiece and lynchpin of the entire saga, suffers from being reduced to a whiny little jerk. I much preferred the determined kid of the second movie to this fatalist loser.That being said, this is still a really good action film. One of the best I've seen in the new century and well worth the price of admission. The movie suffers from the common sequel syndrome of trying to do everything bigger and better, even if it usually ends up jumping the shark, so to speak. However, in this case we get Arnold 'Real-Life Hulk' Schwarzenegger in his last honest action superstar role, really flashy fight sequences, cool chase scenes and lots of dakka. The hotblooded male in me refuses to regard this as a bad thing. And quite honestly the ending manages to reach some of that bleakness that coloured the first two films and made them so jarringly touching. It's not quite there, but you get hints.I rated this movie quite high because I honestly think that it's a great action film. If you're looking for a worthy successor to Cameron's Terminator films, this isn't it, not really. It's still quite an enjoyable ride if you're just looking for a thrilling action piece.",Null,0,1,28 December 2013
"I, Robot"," Doesn't reach its potential
","As a big fan of Isaac Asimov, I can say that I have enjoyed most films based on his work, but I don't think any of them have reached the same tone that permeate his various short stories and novels. More often than not they take the basic ideas and the settings and then proceed to play out as big Hollywood blockbusters. The same in this case. The Three Laws of Robotics are an important part of Asimov's writings, and they do get their limelight here, but the way they are explained, handled and addressed is rather disappointing, because Asimov has dedicated whole novel series to these three laws and their various strengths and weaknesses. And while some of these strengths and weaknesses do get addressed in this film, it still feels like they only scratched the surface, if even that. Much more time is spent following around Will Smith's character, Spooner, and admiring his hijinks and vintage Doc Martinis.And don't get me wrong, I like Will Smith's role here. He plays a very convincing tough cop with a troubled past and you can totally understand his dislike for robots, especially when more light is shed on the events of the past. But I still think that the movie would have been better had more time been spent with the principles and underlying theories of robotics rather than Spooner and his wacky grandmother. I can understand the decision to go with more Spooner and less robo-theory, because it's a more marketable choice, especially with Will Smith in the lead role, but it still lacks ambition and effort.Especially so when Will Smith plays pretty much the only good character in the film. The rest are played by actors of varying quality, but they all seem rather flat and unimaginative, with the possible exception of the robopsychologist Susan Calvin (Bridget Moynahan). She didn't do much for me, but at least she had some characteristics. The same can't be really said about the various robot characters, because while they tried to insert some degree of humanity into them, they also tried to make them a bit alien-like, detached from the world, which also served the purpose of detaching them from the audience.Then again, I must admit that the various robots look remarkably good, especially for their time, and the special effects in general are very nice to look at. The same can be said about the action scenes, which are a lot of fun, being imaginative and intense.In the end, it all boils down to the story, which isn't all that hot, as I've said. It's not bad for a typical blockbusters, if anything it's slightly above average. It's just that there was so much potential for more. They could have gone with a more thoughtful, psychological route, especially with someone like Will Smith leading - he has the depth for it. Instead we get a pretty basic scifi action film. It's very good for what it is, and if you're looking for nothing more, it'll suit your purposes perfectly, but I'll always see what it failed to do, which sours my personal viewing experience.",Null,0,0,18 December 2012
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse," A movie that actually feels like a comic book
","Spider-Man: Into the Spide-Verse - despite the over-convoluted name - is the Spidey movie a lot of us have been waiting for. It's the comic book movie a lot of us have been waiting for.And yes, there has been too many Spider-Man reboots over the last couple of decades. Fatigue has probably set in for a lot of people. Why should they care? What does this have the others didn't? Well, first of all, it's not really a reboot. It's actually better if you have a working knowledge of the previous Spider-Man films, especially the Raimi ones. It's kind of like how you can now make a Batman film without going over the origin story in any way. This movie works through that kind of logic, while still keeping it fresh by introducing Miles Morales, a new kind of Spider-Man.And it's a lot of fun. There are a ton of characters, fast-paced action and a really nice, self-contained story without any sequel baits or anything like that. Sure, it can be a bit convoluted, but the quick humour, the witty banter and the familiar characters keep it chugging along like a well-oiled steam train.But that's not the main reason why you should see this film. It's nice to have them and they elevate the film above merely good and well into the great category, but the reason you should absolutely check this movie out are the visuals. This is a stunningly gorgeous movie. All the colours, all the character designs, the textures, the graphics, the fluidity of the motion, the camera angles, the psychedelic set designs. This is manna from the heavens for any fan of animation. And it's most probably the movie that comes the closest to capturing the feeling of physical comic books, without in any way feeling like it's just a gimmick.Trust me, see this movie. Even if you're tired with Spider-Man. Or with superheroes. Or with animation. It will reignite those feelings of adoration and love you once used to have. Promise.",Null,1,4,12 January 2019
Warrior," People tearing each other apart, both figuratively and literally

At the same time his older brother (Joel Edgerton) has also returned to the cages due to crippling money problems.The plot of Warrior is about as textbook as they come. It's your classic sports underdog, overcoming yourself storyline. But this is not a bad thing. This here is a magnificent example of execution over idea. All three of the main actors are fantastic in their roles, each having very different kind of problems, yet they've all arrived to them due to their similar natures and they all try to solve them in very similar manners. Every scene where they interact with each other is captivating in a way rarely seen in a sports film.Not to say that the movie lacks in the 'grown men beating each other to a pulp' category, either. Because it doesn't. Furthermore, it's refreshing to see a fighting movie that's not about boxing. MMA gives the movie its own unique feel and allows for some moves and fights not often seen. All the fights are also pleasingly different from one another. They're shot well and contain enough suspense, especially when Edgerton's character is fighting.Warrior belongs in the upper echelons of sports drama.

Judgment at Nuremberg," The lesson we have hopefully learned
","After World War Two a number of trials were conducted in Nuremberg, Germany. International courts came together to judge Nazi war criminals. It was decided that Germans alone could not judge their own criminals and that the crimes of the Nazi regime were crimes against humanity itself.The most famous of these trials tried and sentenced 24 Nazi leaders in the years 1945 and -46. But there were a series of less famous trials, conducted mostly by Americans in the occupied West Germany, that aimed to judge and sentence Nazi judges, merchants and other influential figures that were seen to be at least partially responsible for the holocaust, for example. This movie is a fictive version of one of those trials.There are four accused judges. The prosecution is demanding life imprisonment for all of them. But the defense tries to argue on their behalf by saying that they could not have possible have known about the horrors of the concentration camps, among other things. The movie, through the trial, also discusses things such as following orders, loyalty to one's nation, one's homeland, the meaning and concept of justice, the slippery slope of lesser evils, and just what it took to survive under Hitler's rule.The movie was filmed some fifteen years after the war and thus I believe it had enough distance to look at the whole thing at least with something approaching objectivity. It acknowledges the political atmosphere in Germany after World War One, and also during the actual trial, at the brink of the Cold War. It is a heavy movie that forces you to think. And while it is passionate about its message and its take on the whole issue, it doesn't paint the situation as black-n-white. It acknowledges the complexity of the whole thing and preaches caution against something like it happening again. And for that it has my respect.One of those movies I wish was shown more often on TV. Or in schools. Because we should remember what it was like back then, during the days of our parents and grandparents.

Salt," Excellent action spy thriller
","I've said it before and I'm saying it again. Angelina Jolie is the only believable action superstar that also happens to be a woman. She simply has the capacity and the sheer presence to sell us all these roles without in any way taking away from the badassery because of her gender. Quite often we see action movies with female leads that have been watered down because they tried to emphasize the femininity of the character. And that's simply not what we want from a classical action movie.Not Jolie though. Her characters are badasses without any doubt. Oh sure, there are touches here and there that show she's a woman - she's not trying to be more masculine than she normally is - but they're so minimal and so natural that they feel believable. There's no forcing in her performance, it's just who she is.Aside from that Salt also succeeds in its action scenes and its central story, which is over the top and more than a bit silly, I admit, but so are most beloved action classics. It's the serious execution, with just the right amount of tongue in cheek, that makes these kinds of films work and in that regard Salt succeeds beautifully.I'm really hoping they will make a sequel for this, because it's a really good action film with a great leading actress. More stuff like this, please!",Null,2,4,16 September 2014
Apocalypse Now," Crumbles under its own weight
","I have nothing but respect for Francis Ford Coppola. He is deservedly one of the greatest directors of all time and his style of film-making is pretty much inimitable. Yet I can't really say I enjoyed this movie. At least not the Redux version I saw.First the good parts. It's a damn beautiful film. The mood, as they slowly drift up the Vietnamese river, keeps building and building and you can smell the heat and wetness in the air, feel the sweat dripping down your back, hear the hollow echoing screaming around you. The script was heavily inspired by the classic novella Heart of Darkness and that's exactly the mood and atmosphere they achieved.The acting is also topnotch, with one glaring exception, and I've never seen Charlie Sheen do a more convincing role than here. You can almost see the cracks in their souls as the heaviness of the war settles around them as they are pulled from combat and send to face almost certain deaths as they hunt their elusive quarry.It's a well-made film. Everything from camera-work to sets to directing works, and works so well, but the fact remains that's it's just too long. At least the Redux version. You can only stretch the atmosphere and suspense for so long until you start to look at the clock. That's partly the purpose and to this film's credit, any other film would have crumbled way sooner, but crumble it does, eventually.I also have problems with Marlon Brando's performance. Apparently the man showed up hugely overweight, completely unprepared and pretty much being as unprofessional as you can be. And it shows. The final third of the film throws the suspense straight out of the window and pretty much the only question left is 'Brando, what happened, man?' I can see why people love this film. It's a haunting take on war, has amazing atmosphere, vivid imagery, memorable characters and as a whole there are very few movies like it. Personally I lost interest after the halfway point, but that's just me.",Null,2,3,5 May 2015
The Battle of Algiers," Arouses interest
","The French have controlled Algeria since the 1800s, but things finally boil over in the 1950s and the French army has to be called in the quell the uprising of terrorism, led by the FLN (Front de Liberation Nationale). And yet the movie is not about the fight against terrorism. Or, it is, but it's also about the fight against foreign invaders and occupiers.The film is noted both for its style as well as its neutrality. A bit more time is spent with the FLN, but we also see much of the events from the point of view of Colonel Mathieu (Jean Martin), the leader of the French forces. And both these sides commit terrible acts of brutality during their fight for Algiers. Bombings, mass slaughter, torture, everything goes.And apparently all this happened in the 50s, on French-controlled soil. Shows how much I know about history. In fact, the movie almost forces you to know something about its backgrounds and general situation. Very little is explained and it's more of a newsreel slash documentary style look into the methods used by the two sides. Very little is talked about motivations or politics. Which is both of a strength and a weakness. Those that have studied history in detail and/or those that lived during those times are going to find the film poignant and heavy. Those that did not will have an increasingly hard time with it as years pass.Nevertheless, despite belonging to the latter camp of viewers, I did find the film a good watch. It's perhaps more interesting than truly enjoyable, but I would recommend it to anyone interested in history.",Null,2,3,14 June 2017
Silver Linings Playbook," Lighthearted drama with heavy themes
","Silver Linings Playbook tells the story of Pat (Bradley Cooper), a mental institution patient who has just gotten released and now has to re-enter society while avoiding the pitfalls that landed him in the institution in the first place. Enter Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence), a friend of a friend, who has also gone through her own problems and, like Pat, is still dealing with them. Throw in some quirky family members, an overarching goal in the form of a dance competition, some football, and you have Silver Linings Playbook.Now, what makes this film work is the chemistry between Cooper and Lawrence and the sheer talent they bring to their roles. Jennifer Lawrence won an Oscar for her role and it shows. Tiffany is a brilliant mixture of varying characteristics. She's a bit manic, she's a bit of a goth, she has her bitchy moments, but beneath all of it you can see the cheerful and caring person she could be. Full of nuances and personality, she's a great character. Not that Cooper does any worse in his role. The film dedicates more time to Pat, him being the main character, and especially the first few scenes, when he's at his most vulnerable, are very effective in introducing his character and getting us to sympathize with him, while still providing some humour.The story itself isn't overly complex or anything you haven't seen before, but it doesn't really need to be. Romantic comedies/dramas like this one are always more about the characters than plot, so I wasn't expecting anything more. And the story is decent, don't get me wrong. It allows for some nice character moments, some nice dialogue and it carries the movie to a satisfying conclusion. Could it have been better? Yes, but that's a nitpick. No film is perfect.I'd easily recommend this to any fan of romantic comedies/dramas and to anyone who likes strong and layered characters.",Null,1,2,1 April 2014
Divergent," Less intelligent Hunger Games
","A movie series, based on a book by Veronica Roth, which both try to ride the coattails of The Hunger Games franchise, with extremely limited success. The basic premise is the same. The world as we know it has ended and in the ruins of what used to be USA there exists a society where people are held under an iron fist, all in the name of keeping order. And of course it's up to a teenage girl to fight against this oppression.Granted, in this series there doesn't exist any kind of elite class that keeps the rest as slaves or as lower class, which is different enough that you don't feel like watching the exact same movie, but the themes, mood and the general feeling are very, very similar.So yeah, zero points for originality. That being said, the movie is not without value. The technical aspects of movie making are more than fine to please, the two main leads are not without talent and have chemistry together. And while the plot is predictable, it's paced well and doesn't overstay its welcome. The scenes dealing with mindscapes and subconscious fears are the most interesting thing in the movie and offer some creative visuals.In the end I cannot really recommend this film. It's too similar to The Hunger Games, so you should watch those if post-apocalyptic teenage survival interests you. It's not a bad film, per se, just much more average, less ambitious and lacking in scope than its predecessor and source of inspiration.",Null,0,1,2 December 2014
Ender's Game," Looks pretty, but doesn't work as an adaptation
","Ender's Game was never an easy book to adapt into a movie. It covers several years of time from the point of view of a young, growing boy, so having a single, identifiable child actor was always going to be difficult. And many of those years were important so you couldn't just skip over them, although this movie largely did just that, which pretty much killed any value or depth in it.Not that I blame them for doing so, because it could have worked. Asa Butterfield hits that right butter zone, no pun intended, where he is old enough to be a capable actor, theoretically, but he isn't too old for a movie that's all about child soldiers. Compressing the timeline within a year allows Butterfield to play the lead throughout the entire film, though it creates the slightest sense of 'why didn't they start this whole process sooner?' There's some handwaving involved, but it's not enough. Still, it's a tough problem and I can't blame them for trying.Unfortunately it still leaves us with the problem of there not being enough character development. Ender's Game was always all about, well, Ender. It was his journey, and we followed as he grew up, learned from his mistakes, achieved victories. But when the movie isn't even two hours long - a bawling choice if there ever was one - we don't get to see much of that growth, which begs the question 'What then?' What else is there to show if the film makers apparently decided that Ender's growth doesn't warrant much screen time? Apparently special effects and flashy sets drew the long stick, as they're very much in front. This creates a weird paradox, because the actual book described to Battle School as a very sterile place. White and cold, a very utilitarian military feeling, yet there was a lot of going on on a personal level. Whereas in the movie there's too much flashiness on a visual level, but the character interactions feel sterile. Not the right call, film makers.I really think that this movie would have benefited from an extra half an hour. Now everything feels shoehorned in and we don't get enough time or space to mull over things. It's supposed to be this big dramatic movie about using children as instruments of war, but the film tries to force the message down our throats through heavy dialogue and exposition. Not the right way to do pretty much anything. If you like the book, this isn't your movie. If you're looking for a visually pleasing scifi film, I've seen worse.",Null,0,1,13 January 2014
Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters," Mindless fun, for better and for worse
","Lately we have seen a lot of these fairy tale remakes, where they take a basic fairy tale plot, add in a lot of CGI, slightly darker atmosphere and some sex and call it a day. I still prefer the Disney version, thank you very much. At least in those films the story flows smoothly and the characters are not cardboard cutouts. That being said, this particular fairy tale movie was a pleasant surprise. For one, it didn't try to retell the same exact story we have grown up with. Rather it took the story of Hansel and Gretel and asked the question: 'What if they grew up?' I'm totally on board with that question. It's something we've never seen before and frankly it's a fascinating idea. So yeah, colour me interested.The film itself ends up being pretty much what anyone would expect. I hesitate to call it a good film, because it has numerous plot holes, nonsensical twists and its characters are somewhat bland and clich√©d. On the other hand, it has a good visual style, its action is very pleasing, if a bit gore-filled (not a bad thing in this case), the two main actors are actually pretty good in their roles, and as a whole it's just plain solid fun. Yeah, it's stupid most of the time, but it's fun kind of stupid. The kind where you're just able to sit back, enjoy the scenery and laugh at the jokes.It also needs to be remembered that this was Tommy Wirkola's first big budget film. And for a debut film, this shows a lot of promise. The style is definitely there, as is the atmosphere. The story-telling and the character development need some work, but even big name directors struggle with those every now and then. I'm looking forward to what this guy will bring us next.And that's this film. Yeah, it's one of those so bad it's good films, but I'd still recommend this. The idea alone is worth checking out.",Null,21,29,2 May 2013
In the Name of the Father," About the dangers of giving into your fear and anger
","October 1974, London. Young Gerry Conlon (Daniel Day-Lewis) gets arrested by the police. They claim he is an IRA (Irish Republican Army) terrorist and to blame for the bombing in Guildford that killed five people. Gerry maintains that he's innocent, but the police and the people of Britain are hungry for blood. The film is based on real events.As you can imagine, the film is anything but congratulatory towards the society and the justice system of the 70s. The film focuses heavily on Conlon's own personal experiences before and after the bombing, but the film takes it time to get the licks in.Daniel Day-Lewis has earned a reputation as one of the great names in cinema and watching this movie you can certainly see why. It all feels authentic, from the quiet rage to desperation to just giving up, if not outright snapping. I also really liked the performance given by Pete Postlethwaite as Giuseppe, Gerry's father.A heavy movie and makes one appreciate how one has managed to grow in relative peace and quiet. Sure modern Europe has had its own upheavals, but nothing quite like this.If I had to name a negative, I would say that the film is a bit episodic, like many biographical films tend to be. It's better than most I've seen, but the film has to jump around in time a lot and these transitions are not quite as graceful as they perhaps could have been.Still, an interesting movie and a great watch for all fans of historical drama.",Null,0,2,14 January 2019
Being John Malkovich," I don't get it
","At first this movie seems great. I actually thought for a while that this might be a Terry Gilliam film, with its bizarre sets, odd characters and dystopian set designs and aesthetics. It was not, but it seemed like it, and the first third of the film was immensely enjoyable as we slowly get to know this strange world.And then they went nowhere with it. Sure, there is a portal that leads into John Malkovich's head. But what they do with it is the least imaginable thing. And why even John Malkovich? The writer Charlie Kaufman has said that Malkovich was always his first and only choice, but I just don't see why. He certainly stands out because of his looks, and he has the acting skills to play the different people inhabiting his head, but aside from that there's nothing interesting about him shown in this film. He lives in an apartment, tries out for roles¬Ö and that's it.Plus the fact that the main character is a puppeteer. Okay, at first that's interesting. It's out there, not something we see in every movie and jives well with the whole bizarre first third the movie has. But then it is stretched way out of proportion, with much of the running length dedicated to odes to puppetry. Why? Sure, there's the joke about the ultimate puppet, but there needs to be more than that. Now it barely connects with anything.Then there are the romance subplots, which are passable, though boring, and mainly there to move the plot along. The final truth about the portal is also pretty lame. It's pretty much what you would guess if you sat and thought for a minute.All in all Being John Malkovich was a huge disappointment for me. If you have a story about a portal that allows you to control a real life Hollywood star, go all out. Don't give us this halfway there balderdash. Be Terry Gilliam. Make it as weird as possible. Attempting to put logic and cohesive narrative into it only waters it down.",Null,5,9,9 September 2015
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation," Ethan Hunt on the run
","Rogue Nation sees Tom Cruise return, once again, as master spy extraordinaire Ethan Hunt. This time he's hunting the Syndicate, an international terrorist organization set on tearing down the modern society and building something new upon its ashes. Unfortunately, not even some of his allies believe that this organization even exists.The film continues to build upon the good things set up in its predecessors. It always feels like the stakes are just a bit higher, the cost of failure even harder to pay. But it's a slow enough ramp-up that we're nowhere close it being ludicrous yet. Suffice to say, I heavily enjoy Cruise in his role. I also really like Simon Pegg and Jeremy Renner as his colleagues, and it was nice to see Ving Rhames return in a more substantial role.As for the new actors, there are two worth mentioning. Sean Harris as Solomon Lane and Rebecca Ferguson as Ilsa Faust. Harris's Lane is a tough contender for the best villain in the franchise, while Ferguson's Ilsa is just about the best thing in general in the franchise. Tough, no-nonsense spy, who's one of the few people that seem to be able to keep up with Hunt without much difficulty. It's fascinating seeing them work off one another. Luckily she returns in Fallout, because it would have been a real shame to lose her.That being said, I do miss the locations and the exotic tone of Ghost Protocol. Every single scene and each location in that film was iconic, which is unfortunately not something this film can say. It's still very good, but not masterful. Granted, the opera house scene is superb, but after that they get a lot duller. The action still works and the characters are amazing, it's simply that the locations aren't as memorable.Still, I'd say this easily qualifies as the second best film in the franchise. It's no Ghost Protocol, but then again, few things are.",Null,0,1,16 February 2020
The Machinist," Excellent psychological thriller
","One of Christian Bale's more interesting roles and a film with a well-deserved good reputation. A story about one Trevor Reznik (Bale), an insomniac factory worker who moves through his life in a constant daze, a mere shadow of his former self. A continuous cloud hangs over his life and even sources of joy are filtered through a dark gloom. And then things start to go wrong.The Machinist works partly because of Bale's excellent performance and partly because it knows how to build and maintain suspense. Bale lost a considerable amount of weight for the movie, unhealthily so, but it cannot be said that it doesn't add something to the movie when you can count every single bone in his body through his pallid skin. A haunting visual and a haunting performance as Trevor starts to slowly question his very existence.The plot is also interesting, though it bears some resemblance to movies like Memento, another Bale movie. Not that it's a bad thing and the end twist is still original enough not to disappoint, but the similarities are striking.Not much else can be said about the movie without spoiling it, so I'll finish by saying that it's a movie well worth a watch for fans of thrillers.

The Intouchables," Funny, touching, a bit bland
","The masterpiece of directors Olivier Nakache & √âric Toledano. A story of a ghetto black man (Omar Sy), who ends up getting a job as the life-in caregiver for a wealthy quadriplegic aristocrat (Fran√ßois Cluzet). And what do you know, the black man ends up teaching the aristocrat some fantastic new things about life. Think Driving Miss Daisy in modern day Paris.This film feels and looks nice. The cinematography, all the technical aspects really, look, sound and feel great. It's definitely a professionally made film. I also have to praise the performance of the two main leads. Cluzet's character is a very reserved, very stoic gentleman, which means that he doesn't have quite as much room to really let loose acting-wise, but even still he gives a praiseworthy performance. But it's Sy who's the star of the movie, with his boundless energy, his ever-ending optimism and his streetwise manners that give none and expect none.All that being said, the story is clich√©d. Based on a true story, sure, but the fact still remains that daytime TV is filled with films just like this one. This is no doubt better directed, better filmed and better acted than any of those fluff films, but you still end up feeling like you're being pandered towards.Still, it just might be that I'm biased towards these kinds of stories. It is a well-crafted film, after all. If the premise interests you, by all means, give it a watch.",Null,1,3,13 February 2018
Ratatouille," Hearty, vibrant and comforting - just like a good meal
","The second Pixar film to be directed by Brad Bird and once again his strong areas shine through. The story is about a culinary mastermind, a chef of chefs, who just happens to be a common farm rat. Remy, the rat in question, gets separated from his family in the sewers and ends up meeting a cleaning boy, Linguini, who's working for a famous restaurant. Remy's talents pull through and he ends up preparing meals for the restaurant through Linguini.An odd story, to say the least, but it has its own bizarre logic. And it isn't afraid of acknowledging its own strangeness. Every single time a person learns a rat prepared their meal, their reaction is priceless.But what really elevates this movie above its peers is the technical talent of Brad Bird. Just like his debut film with Pixar, The Incredibles, this movie is an absolute joy to watch for the pure visual splendour it offers. Its Paris is the amalgamation of all those Parises we've grown to love. Its colours are the colours of dreams. Its way to portray food is something straight out of a Studio Ghibli film. If you're not hungry after watching this film, there's something wrong with your stomach.Plus, the characters are a lot of fun. Anton Ego, a food critic with a bone to pick with Remy's restaurant, might just very well be my all-time favourite Pixar antagonist. Remy is also a fine character and all the different restaurant workers are a lot of fun. The only one that falls a bit short is unfortunately Linguini, who's the second most important character. But even he's just a bit bland rather than outright awful.Ratatouille falls on the clunky side of storytelling. It could flow smoother. It juggles a plot point or two too many. But, that being said, it is such a nice experience that I'm more than willing to forgive its minor transgressions. If you haven't seen it already, do yourself a favour.",Null,0,0,26 March 2019
The Amazing Spider-Man," Surprisingly, the reboot surpasses the original
","The Amazing Spider-Man, in my honest opinion, is better than the Sam Raimi trilogy. Not by much and both franchises have their fair share of both good and bad, but on average, the new ones are better. As controversial as that sounds, and I know there are those that don't share my sentiments at all.But, let me explain. The two main reasons why I think The Amazing Spider-Man is better are Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone. I never quite liked Tobey Maguire in the originals. Sure he made for a very convincing Peter Parker at his most geekiest, but I never bought him as Spider-Man. Garfield, on the other hand, can do both. Sure his Peter Parker is a more self-confident take on the character. He's more of an oddball tech genius than a nerd, but that's a valid take on the character so I have no complaints. Plus that characterization lends much more easily to what Spider-Man, at his core, should be: a trickster. Add in Emma Stone's Gwen Stacy and you have one of the best romantic pairings ever seen in a superhero movie. The two have incredible chemistry together and you'll totally buy they're in love. Plus Gwen Stacy is a lot of fun. She's active, independent, genius in her own right and actually has a role in the film beyond being the romantic interest and a damsel in distress.Furthermore, the advances in special effects are put to a good use and the action scenes are very cool to look at. The actual settings are perhaps a bit more ordinary than in the originals, but the fighting styles are more varied and you can feel the speed of the combat. There are also some really cool slow motion scenes, reminding me of the Robert Downey Jr. Sherlock Holmes films.The one aspect where this film is clearly inferior is unfortunately the villains. The ones in the originals were given a lot of depth and emotion and they were certainly memorable. Sure they were goofy, but that was part of the charm. Not so much in this one. The style overall is more realistic and perhaps even a bit darker, which hits the villains the hardest. They just aren't that interesting or memorable without the over-the-topness.It's also worth noticing that the storyline is very similar to the first Spider-Man. Usually a reboot that just rehashes the same would be doomed to failure, but this time it surprisingly works. Once again the stronger actors pull this film back from the brink.In the end it comes down to a matter of taste. Do you like Tobey Maguire or strong, enjoyable villains? Then you'll probably prefer the originals. Do you want to see a more joking, confident Peter Parker and a romantic lead that's actually worth a damn? Then The Amazing Spider-Man might just surprise you.",Null,1,3,24 May 2014
The Lego Movie," Surprisingly decent
","I must admit, I wasn't expecting much walking into this movie. I mean, it's a movie about Lego characters, with an actual Lego Batman and everything. How good could it honestly be? But, to my surprise, this movie made me remember just how much fun I used to have with Lego. The sheer imagination and endless possibilities involved were what made them so great and this movie showcases those aspects beautifully.It's also a good story in general and includes some really good twists. Admittedly the final reveal and ending can seem a bit bizarre, but I could stomach it without any major problems and many of my friends absolutely loved how out there it was.Furthermore, the voice acting is topnotch, the trademark characters are utilized well and with lots of humour and the original characters fit well with them without being overshadowed. But the greatest part of all this are the visuals. Everything has been built out of Lego blocks. Everything. And everything even has the Lego logo on it, every block. It's mindblowing how much detail they've managed to squeeze in and how painstakingly accurate they try to remain. Enormous extra points just for that.The Lego Movie is excellent movie for children and adults alike.

Dallas Buyers Club," Brilliance of two actors
","Dallas Buyers Club received recognition in the form of both Academy Awards for Male Actors, both main and supporting, becoming the fifth overall and the first in over a decade to win both. This is fitting, seeing as the two award receivers in question, Matthew McConaughey and Jared Leto, do give some of the most grounded, real and hauntingly human performances seen in a while. This is their tale and the movie shines solely because of them.It's mid-80s and AIDS hysteria is in full swing. No one knows what this new, terrifying disease is all about and no one expects the victims to live longer than a few weeks. History tells us that thousands simple wasted away in hospitals, hooked up to machines to alleviate their pain. But there were some who refused to give up, who went out and looked for cure no matter what. This is a story about one such man.McConaughey plays Ron Woodroof beautifully. Outwardly and at first he's your typical Texas rodeo jock, full of swagger, empty promises and dirty innuendos. Yet as the movie progresses, you start to see the core of iron within him. You start, partly despite yourself, to appreciate his determination, his intelligence and his willingness to do what others will not or can not do.Leto is certainly somewhat overshadowed by McConaughey's excellence, but his performance shouldn't be dismissed either. Rayon, a HIV positive homosexual works as a classic foil. He's the sensibility to Woodroof's bluster, the emotion to his logic, the inside view into a world Woodroof has previously dismissed altogether. Both are subtle and nuanced performances even though their characters are crude, vulgar and outlandish.Dallas Buyers Club will win you over with its plot, storytelling and most of all characters. It's one of those movies where you cannot really find any faults even though it might not otherwise become one of your favourite movies. Heavily recommended.",Null,1,1,11 July 2014
The Fast and the Furious," Surprisingly good
","Officer Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker) goes undercover in the Los Angeles street racing circuits in order to find out which of the racing crews is committing crimes with their muscle cars. But going undercover is never easy, especially with such affable miscreants.The basic premise is really nothing special. But then again, it doesn't need to be. The point of this movie is in its style. It has fast cars, lots of racing, lots of hot, greased-up babes, muscle-heavy men (and cars) and a killer soundtrack. You don't watch it to be intrigued by carefully orchestrated plot points or tragic backstories or the heaviness of its pathos. No, you watch it to kick back, relax and have a good time.And in delivering that, the movie more than delivers. But if it was just that, I'd probably rate the film a bit lower. What actually elevates this film above its immediate peers and helped launch a huge franchise, is the fact that this film is punching above its weight class and succeeding. And it does that by having some real good actors playing roles they were born to play. Walker is one of them, but I also have to mention Vin Diesel and Michelle Rodriguez.The dialogue is also surprisingly snappy and memorable. The plot, while basic, succeeds in making you care for these characters, and it also manages to make itself feel novel, despite arguably being at least a little clich√©d. Once again, the fact that you care for these characters matters a lot.Not a groundbreaking movie by any means, but it has surprising quality underneath all the testosterone being forcibly pumped into your veins.",Null,0,0,4 May 2020
The Exorcist," Masterpiece of a horror story
","The Exorcist has often been called the greatest horror movie ever made, and for a good reason. It was revolutionary during its release and the passage of decades has not dulled its impact in the slightest. It's still an uneasy film in the best possible meaning of the word, tapping into several sources of fear simultaneously, while still telling a coherent, captivating story. You get the creepy atmosphere right from the start as we follow an old priest in the desert and find out with him that something wrong has slipped through the cracks into the world of man. Something old and ancient, something that does not belong.But we've seen many creepy films since then and if that was all the movie had, if it was all promise and no payout, it wouldn't have earned its reputation. Luckily, the film is more rounded than that. Many 'horror' movies nowadays rely on jump scares, easy wrights that momentarily spike our adrenaline levels without scaring the mind. It's physical, instinctive and ultimately leaves no impact. This movie and other films like it, however, do utilize shock value as a mean to create horror, but the imagery they use goes deeper than something that merely looks scary or unsettling. The sight of Regan (Linda Blair) being slowly corrupted by a demon is jarring on an emotional level. It touches the nurturing side within us. It's wrong, it's taboo and because of that it's something we will remember, something we automatically oppose. It's adult fear, to use the technical term, something quite different from being afraid of the monster under the bed.Furthermore, it's a film that shines in execution as well. All the actors do a magnificent job of portraying ordinary people that have to face the unthinkable, the impossible. The movie doesn't shy away from reality in order to make the story seem more plausible. Rather it freely acknowledges the implausibility of the situation, contradictorily making it a more believable film. Add in brilliant sound design, masterful use of music to create atmosphere, stunningly effective practical effects and great lighting and you have a film that quite effortlessly convinces you that yes, a small girl can become possessed, easily in fact.I don't think it's out of line to say you're not a true fan of horror before you've seen this film. It does so many things right and gets so little wrong that it's no wonder people still flock into theaters to see reruns of it, that people still talk about it, discuss it, lose sleep over it. Greatest horror movie of all time? Quite possibly. At the very least it's right up there at the top.",Null,5,9,18 February 2014
Now You See Me," Tries to juggle one too many balls, but otherwise fine
","Yet another heist movie where the con artists pull of frankly speaking ridiculous games in order to further their own agenda. This particular one throws in the magician angle, and it works surprisingly well. Jesse Eisenberg, Woody Harrelson, Isla Fisher and Dave Franco all do a great job as The Four Horsemen, the magicians in question, and I really enjoyed them. They all have a clear identity, even if Eisenberg's J. Daniel Atlas does get the most screen time, but then again every group needs a face. Would I have preferred for all them to be on the screen equally? Probably, seeing as Harrelson especially was a bit underutilized, but the movie works as it is.Mark Ruffalo also does a really good job as the FBI detective trying to catch these four. Usually in a caper or heist movie such as this one, you can either have the despicable mark that everyone loves to see fooled, or you can have the sympathetic mark, but in that case the actor has to be charismatic enough to pull it off. Luckily Ruffalo is just that. He's angry and arrogant enough that you don't feel bad when he gets fooled, but he's also nice enough that you feel for him and don't mind following him around.Unfortunately the movie is a bit crowded with unneeded side characters. And as much as it pains me to say this, Morgan Freeman is the worst offender. He's a fine actor and literally oozes charisma, but his character has little to no point being in this film. He's mainly there to spout exposition that could have easily been relocated to other characters. M√©lanie Laurent has the same problem, though her character might have been bearable if it had been just her taking up precious screen time.Aside from that I can say that it's an okay film. The first half, when we get introduced to the characters and the mysteries, is easily the best part of the film. All the Horsemen are given a really good introduction, the first two show scenes are phenomenal fun and it feels like it's building up to something great.That something turns out to be something of a letdown and I cannot say that I enjoyed the final third or so all that much. It's passable, but when my friends and I discussed this movie afterwards, we very quickly came up with numerous ways it could have been made better. Mark of a poor film writing. It's hard to write a good ending, I know, but at least some effort should be involved.Still, all in all this is a good film. It's fun to watch, the characters are enjoyable and the magic tricks are both pleasing to witness as well as imaginative. The ending isn't the greatest one possible, but it doesn't ruin the film. Give it a watch if you like heist films or stage magic.One question though. Why wasn't the name of this movie The Four Horsemen?",Null,0,0,30 December 2013
X-Men: Days of Future Past," Pure fan indulgence with great production values
","X-Men: Days of Future Past is certainly an ambitious project, attempting to stitch together both film franchises, the original X-Men trilogy as well as the 2011 semi-reboot X-Men: First Class. And the way it accomplishes this is certainly both effective and commendable. The story is believable, most of the important loopholes get closed and as a whole it's just a lot of fun.The best thing here are the actors. Pretty much all the actors from both franchises reprise their roles, which is an impressive feat and all around heartwarming. The main show belongs to Hugh Jackman (Wolverine) as well as Patrick Stewart/James McAvoy (Charles Xavier) and Ian McKellen/Michael Fassbender (Erik Lehnsherr). All five are talented actors in their own right and they absolutely nail these characters and give us some really good character moments. The rest of the cast is equally up to the task and it's great to see so many of them in the same film, seeing that X-Men has always been about a group of people coming together to fight greater evil.But here I have to be honest and admit that I was kind of expecting more from the story. Once again mutants are threatened by evil, bigoted men and it's up the X-Men to stop this threat before the society slides out of balance. We've seen this before, and while the execution here is superb and allows an old story to feel refreshing, it's still an old story. And there were a couple of clear points in the movie, where they could have broken the mold, but instead they went with the expected. Sure it's faithful to the comic books, but these characters are so huge that there would have been room for variance.And that leaves me with a conundrum. I loved the characters, I loved the action scenes, I loved the production values, but I honestly cannot say the same about the story. I didn't dislike it either, but it could have been so much better with so little effort. The film is still worth seeing, easily, but you should be advised that if you're expecting something new story-wise, you're not going to get it. Although the final ending is great in its own indulgent way.",Null,4,6,2 July 2014
Captain America: Civil War," Grand adventure slash battle royale
","The Marvel Cinematic Universe continues strong with this one. The events of the second Avengers movie, combined with the events of the second Captain America movie, continue to take their toll. The Avengers have become the supreme force on Earth through the fall of S.H.I.E.L.D. and their victory over Ultron. But supreme force demands supreme resistance and thus the Avengers have to ask themselves: is their very existence begetting more problems than they can solve and if so, should they be held responsible for it.Captain America has become the central icon of Marvel movies, perhaps even more so than Iron Man and this is shown in his movies. This could easily be called Avengers 2.5: Civil War. It has almost all of the characters, it moves the universe forwards and its themes will echo throughout all the movies that come after it. Things change with this film, nothing will be the same.And it's simply a good action movie on its own. The cast is still absolutely fantastic, especially Chris Evans as Steve Rogers and Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark. Every scene the two of them are in is some of the finest character acting I've seen in a while. Especially because they have such heave themes to discuss. And while the movie itself leans slightly towards Cap's position, it makes Tony's point of view painfully clear and relatable. People should be held accountable, power requires oversight and the strongest should lead the way for everyone. It's just a matter of how they go about realizing these ideals that set these two apart.Furthermore, the new and returning lesser characters are both very good, especially Chadwick Boseman as Black Panther. I can't wait for his stand-alone film, having seen this! And, as always, the action scenes are phenomenal, the production values are as perfect as they can get, the humour works and it's just an all-around good movie.If I had to nitpick, I'd say that it perhaps a bit grim for my tastes. It has humour, certainly, but the storyline itself is pretty bleak and the ending especially will divide opinions. Personally I can say that I respect its ambition and scope more than I actually like it. Let's just say that we're pretty far from the days of The Avengers and it's light-heartedness, and leave it at that.Still, definitely a film worth seeing for all fans of Marvel. They haven't dropped the ball yet.",Null,2,5,25 September 2016
Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them," More of the same
","If you liked, let's say the last three Harry Potter films, you're going to enjoy this film just fine. It's cut very much from the same cloth, with excellent special effects, wizarding world oddities, unsuspecting muggles, wand-waving, all that jazz. Unfortunately it also shares a lot of flaws with those three movies. The colour palette is still pretty grim and dark, as is the general mood of the world. The characters are quirky and likable, but also rather one-dimensional or at least they don't grow a lot during the movies. The dialogue goes up and down in quality, though can be quite excellent in certain moments. And yes, dear J. K. Rowling, we get it. Bureaucracy is the root and symptom of all evil. All. Evil. Can we please move on to other subject matters because this is getting tedious.On the other hand the film does improve upon certain things. It's nice to see the American wizarding society, though as stated, it shares certain annoying similarities with the British one. All the eponymous fantastic beasts are simply fascinating and the movie broadens Rowling's world excellently. I also like that the main character Newt uses these critters in combat as well, because for some reason the makers of these films seem to think that magical combat has to consist of fast-flying coloured blobs of light. And nothing else!All this criticism aside, I cannot help but admit that I like the movie. I love the Harry Potter universe and I will see these movies however many they end up making. But that doesn't mean that I cannot point out the flaws. I love it that much.",Null,1,3,21 January 2017
Gandhi," Almost more about India than it is about Mahatma Gandhi
","Mahatma Mohandas Gandhi is one of those giants of history everyone with even a basic education knows about. To quote this very movie, it is impossible to know anyone through a single story, but at least we now have this film to help us get started or to round out the picture we already have from our history classes.The film follows Gandhi throughout the years. From his early days as an attorney in South Africa, fighting against the unfair treatment of Indian workers, to his assassination in India during the first years of its newly won independence. The film focuses heavily on his personality and his philosophy against violence, but also against blind obedience.As to the genre of the film, it is very much an epic, placing it in the same group alongside such films as Lawrence of Arabia or Ben-Hur. Both of those are much older, but the scope is the same. Decades of time pass while we focus on a single person, around whom whole empires shake. Plus, it's running time is epic as well.Not that the film feels like it's over three hours long. When the intermission rolled around, I was honestly surprised that bit over hour and a half had already passed. The movie has this gift of pulling you in and making you care about each individual moment. The film is always moving forward, even when nothing much seems to be happening.It is a great film about a fascinating person, quite unlike anyone else that has ever lived. Recommended seeing for just about anyone.",Null,0,0,15 December 2018
American History X," Abrupt ending somewhat ruins it for me
","Derek Vinyard (Edward Norton) is a neo-Nazi skinhead who gets sent to prison after he brutally murders the black hooligans that try to steal his car. The movie jumps between timelines following his and his younger brother's lives both before, during and after the prison sentence, as Derek learns to question his commitments to the white supremacy cause.It's a skillful movie, no doubt about it. The non-linear chronology allows us to slowly learn about Derek and see what caused him to change. His younger brother Danny (Edward Furlong) also functions as an important character and a message about the cyclic nature of hate. Derek learned to hate from his father and in time taught Danny to hate. Now it's up to him to teach Danny to accept.The movie is also shot really well. The cinematography is brisk and clean, and the numerous black-n-white scenes give the film a style of its own. The non-linearity is handled well and the story is easy to follow. However, the movie does end a bit abruptly in my mind. And on a note I'm still not quite sure whether I like or not. On the surface it seems to undermine the whole message of the film, but on the other hand you could also see it as a final test. Nevertheless, I do think there could have been a better way to end the film, but I'm sure I'm on the minority in this.It's still a great film to check out. Personally, if I wanted to recommend a film about a neo-Nazi redeeming himself, I'd go with Dome Karukoski's Heart of a Lion. But that's a much more obscure film.",Null,0,0,13 February 2017
Ocean's Eleven," One of the penultimate heist films
","I think that Ocean's Eleven is the film a lot of my generation recalls when they hear the term heist film. And for a good reason. A reboot of an older film by the same name, it updates its story to the modern era, features an all-star cast of high end actors and as a whole is the very definition of slick and cool. Exactly the qualities a good heist film has going for it.Objectively looking Ocean's Eleven doesn't really do anything revolutionary. The story, while more sympathetic to the crooks, is basically the same as far as the premise goes, the plan is clever and will keep you guessing until the end, but doesn't contain any huge twists, and the style is something we've seen before. It's just a matter of how well it can pull those clich√©s off. And this movie is the very definition of tropes are not bad. Everything in it is textbook, but in the best possible meaning of the term.To be fair, a lot of that is due to the two main leads, Clooney and Pitt. These two are cool and suave in everything they do, and together they are dynamite. It's no wonder they got two sequels out of this. I'm actually somewhat disappointed they didn't get more.You've all seen this film already. It's a part of our cultural understanding nowadays, a clich√©, a definition, an understanding of something that just is, a trope in and on itself. And in the end, that simply means that it's a movie worth seeing.",Null,1,2,18 March 2015
Spirited Away," My favourite film of all time
","Hayao Miyazaki's Spirited Away is a story of Chihiro, a young girl moving to a new town with her parents, who gets trapped in the realm of spirits when she and her parents explore an abandoned holiday resort. There she must learn to cope with hostile beings, unexplained rules and the fact that her parents have been cursed into pigs for their crimes.The film has been compared to Alice in Wonderland, and there's a lot of truth to that. Chihiro and Alice are rather alike in their general demeanour and character. Chihiro is a bit more sullen, whereas Alice takes it all a bit more in stride. You definitely feel like Chihiro is in more danger throughout the film. But both Wonderland and the spirit bathhouse operate using logic not belonging to the human realm.And that's one of the best things about this film. Its world is a strange one and there's always a new surprise around the corner. But for some reason it all makes sense. Like there's this scene where Chihiro and Haku, her new protector, have to cross a bridge and he tells her to hold her breath or she'll get noticed. Does that objectively make any sense? No, but in that instance it's completely logical. You just get it. Holding your breath makes you invisible to spirits. Makes perfect sense.And the whole movie is like that. Apparently Miyazaki got his inspiration for the film by watching his young nieces and other relatives playing around. Which makes a lot of sense if you've seen the film. It is internally consistent and you always feel like its following rules. But they're the rules of a child's imagination.Furthermore, it's gorgeously animated, very well voice acted, with fantastic characters, songs, ideas and locations. It's a movie that you could play on mute and it'd still be one of the best movies you've ever seen. Likewise if you only heard it playing from another room. It's both child-like and surprisingly mature at the same time. Most character start out scary, alien and a bit threatening, but quite a lot of them have become your friends by the end of it.My personal favourite. One of the few films I'd call perfect. Please, if you're ever going to see even one Japanese animated film, makes it this one.",Null,0,0,13 January 2020
Spirited Away," My favourite film of all time
","To me, this is the most real film I've ever seen. And it's an animated fantasy film inhabited by spirits, witches and dragons. It takes place in a Japanese bathhouse of all things and is full of magic, strange and new worlds, gods and mystical events. And yet I've learned more from it, identified more with its characters, than from any other film. Hayao Miyazaki is that good of a storyteller.Now, what do I mean by saying it's real? Simply put, it feels like I've known these characters my entire life. Chihiro, or main character, is a young girl moving to a new town, but on their way there, her family happens upon what seems like an abandoned holiday resort. Unfortunately, things are not as they seem, and her parents get captured into the spirit world, inhabited by gods and spirits. And now she has to accept responsibility for the first time in her life and stand on her own feet in order to rescue her parents.But that's not the only story line. We also have Haku, her mysterious helper, who has been captured as well, in his own way. We have Yubaba, the witch owner of the bathhouse, who seeks to enslave Chihiro by stripping everything from her, including her name. We have Kamaji and Lin, who work at the bathhouse. And we have No-Face. All these characters seem like they could easily be the focus of the movie, each of them having a very detailed and rich backstory, which we get to explore as the movie goes on, but it never feels like it's too much. The story lines support one another in a way I've almost never seen anywhere else. Miyazaki has woven it tight and whenever I see the film I find new or forgotten ways in which the events work together.It's also a beautiful film. Out of all Studio Ghibli films, only Princess Mononoke can compete with it in terms of beauty, quality and grandeur of animation. The colours, the character designs, the small touches and details. All wonderful. The score by Joe Hisaishi is also fantastic. It's a bit more downplayed than say Mononoke, not containing quite so memorable tunes and themes, but it's still beautiful and supports the storytelling perfectly.This is about as close to a perfect film as you can get. At least, for me. I think Doug Walker said it best in his review. It's a film so good that it makes you jealous. It's a story so good that you wanted to be the one to tell it. Well, that might be true for me as well, but I still enjoy the film above all else. I love it, I respect it and I'm going to see it regularly for the rest of my life.",Null,0,1,28 January 2016
Tropic Thunder," Comedy with occasional gems of brilliance
","In many respects Tropic Thunder is merely your average action movie parody. It has lots of pointing and laughing, over-played clich√©s, over-the-top acting, lampshade hanging and general goofiness. It's also very meta with most of the best jokes being played at expense of actor stereotypes, instead of action ones. And it's this last point which makes this film work. That, and a really good cast of talented actors.Because deep down this movie is nothing special. It is just as aimlessly random and offensive as most parodies. It never really surprises you or offers you anything new. Still, if you like comedies, it'd serve even without its best parts. What elevates it above mere average, however, is how well the jokes are told. And this is largely thanks to the actors. Robert Downey Jr. especially has received a lot of praise for his portrayal of Kirk Lazarus, an extreme method actor that never breaks character until the filming is completely done. And it just so happens that his character plays a black guy in the film within this film. It's offensive and more than a little awkward, but also extremely funny. The way he speaks cracked me up every single time he opened his mouth. Add in Tom Cruise, Jack Black and so many other A-list names and you start to realize why this film managed to rise above its peers.Not that the writing is weak either. It's nothing special, as stated, but it has a good sense of timing, the premise is imaginative enough and allows for some good jokes, and it strikes a good balance between character moments and general silliness. Not every joke hits a bullseye, but quite many of them do.Easily recommended for all fans of action comedies.",Null,0,1,9 June 2014
Scott Pilgrim vs. the World," Horrible morals, cool execution
","I recognize and admit that this is a good film, arguably even a great one. It has a very unique sense of humour, a visual style that's one of the few I've seen that manages to capture the essence of comic books and a character cast that's certainly memorable if not identifiable. That being said, I still loath this film. I do not like it. However, I have given it seven out of ten, because I can admit that the reason I don't like this film has nothing to do with its quality. Rather I hate its roster of characters, especially the main cast, and its morals.Scott Pilgrim vs. the World is a movie about a young man. The youngster in question isn't even that interesting. He's in a band, sure, but otherwise he's kind of a wimp. The kind of a nerd that other nerds will feel superior towards. Plus he's kind of an asshole, cheating behind the backs of his girlfriends just because he's too much of a coward or perhaps just too lazy to break up with them. He's not an admirable man, yet the whole movie revolves around him and his decisions. His 'heroics'. Now, some might claim that Scott is a perfect main character because of this, because he's the perfect everyman. Perhaps a bit of a pessimistic version of one, but still, he's very bland and normal, only the circumstances into which he is thrust upon are extraordinary. I however argue that a) he's an asshole and not at all likable, and b) movie's are supposed to inspire us, to show us something that we don't see in our everyday life.At this point someone will argue that not every film has to be all about moral triumph and the nobleness of human mind. And that person would be right. I'm not claiming that my viewpoints have any kind of superiority here, they're only my personal take on this film. But I think that my viewpoints have relevance as they're one way to look at this film, a rather rare way from what I've gathered, but a way nonetheless. And sometimes the more extreme opinions, the rarer ones, are the ones worth sharing.But as I've said, this is not a bad film. It has style, its actions scenes are some of the best there are, its dialogue is very fast-paced and brimmed with jokes and double meanings. And while I think that most characters in this film aren't pretty loathsome human beings, I cannot claim that they do not feel realistic. Their behaviour is sometimes very outlandish and caricature-like, but beneath all that they're still just like people that I've met and known in real life. The morals and worldviews of this film are pretty horrible, but perhaps the reason I hate the film so much is because the message hits so close to home. It's quite possible that I just don't want to face the truth.So yeah, in the end I feel that I have to recommend this film to you. I personally don't like it, but it's just me. Love it or hate it, you at least owe it to yourselves to see this film and form your own opinions.",Null,2,5,5 December 2012
The Usual Suspects," Game-changing crime mystery
","The Usual Suspects is one of those movies everyone even slightly interested in thrillers knows and has most likely watched at some point in their life. But, if you're a newcomer and hearing about this film for the first time, trust me when I say you're in for a treat.It's best to approach this film with as little information as possible. It has tremendous rewatching value, but when you're seeing it for the first time, it's best to know as little as possible. The script is so iron tight, so twisting and turning that it loses something if you have some inkling about what's going to happen.It's also a very well-acted film. The team of five conmen, the suspects as they are, are all played by some very talented people giving their performances of a lifetime. Stephen Baldwin and Kevin Spacey deserve special mentions for portraying Michael McManus, tough, aging conman trying to get out of the game and Roger 'Verbal' Kint, his neurotic, twitchy friend, respectively. Great chemistry, great moments, all around just perfect casting and acting.The Usual Suspects doesn't disappoint and it's one of those films that are just as much the second time around. Heavily recommended.",Null,0,1,1 August 2014
Inside Out," Marvelously clever and insightful
","In many ways Pixar is the only animation studio that can stand on par with Disney when it comes to the quality of their movies. And this film just might be crowning achievement of that. It tells about a young eleven-year-old girl, Riley, whose family moves from rural Minnesota to San Francisco. This causes great upheaval in her tiny little head and we get to see it play out. And in more detail than you'd ever imagine. For you see, all those tiny little voices in your head? In this movie they're real people, populating the control center of your head, guiding your actions. This is a movie about them as much as it is about Riley.And yes, the idea has been done before, but usually as a throwaway gag, as a punchline to a joke, or as a fodder for jokes. And yeah, this is a lighthearted family animation film, there are plenty of jokes here as well, but the idea itself is treated very seriously and very maturely. What does it really mean to be influences by your emotions? What emotions are responsible for which aspects of your life? For example, what emotion do you need to feel empathy towards others? Think about it for a minute. The answer might surprise you.While exploring the possibilities we also get the usual Pixar goodies. Exciting adventure, fantastic voice acting, superb animation, good music and some real tearjerker moments. It's an emotional film - try not to die from shock - but in the best possible way. It earns those laughs, tears and shudders. It's that good and that confident in its story.And yeah, I have some nitpicks, like the fact that it is a bit strange that there's only one positive emotion, Joy, against four negative ones, Sadness, Anger, Fear and Disgust. Or the fact that most of the side characters have extremely lazy character designs. The set designs and overall art style are both fantastic, but the side characters are mostly just blobs of colour, for some baffling reason. But that's just nitpicking. Nothing in this film is outright flawed.This just jumped straight into the position of my favourite Pixar film. It's mature, insightful, just as suitable for adults as it is for kids and it's exactly the kind of film you can see over and over throughout your life and it will keep growing with you. So good to have you back, Pixar.",Null,3,21,18 November 2015
Inside Out," Destined to be a classic
","Inside Out, from director Pete Docter, is in my opinion the best movie Pixar has made so far. And this is Pixar we're talking about so that's saying something.And it's not just because it's an engaging family friendly film where colourfully animated, fun-sized friends go on adventures together to get back home. Although, it is. It's not because it's gorgeously animated, and has some amazing textures, character designs and visual puns. Although, it is, and it has.It's not even because it's a great story about growing up, learning to live in a new situation and remembering what's most important. Although, it most definitely is.No, what separates Inside Out from other great Pixar films, from other great animated films in general, is how well it speaks about emotions, about their importance, about their nuance. This is a movie, which those people who are kids now and will grow up to become adults, will name as one of those movies that shaped them. Taught them, for example, that's it's okay to be sad. Essential even because how else would you feel empathy.Personally I learned a lot watching The Lion King as a child. I learned about responsibility and trust. And I learned about the concept of death, about loss. And it was a good lesson.This movie is on par with The Lion King. Better even in some ways. The story is perhaps not as engaging, but the morals and the lessons have even more impact.A gem of a movie and hopefully we'll see more movies of this quality out of Pixar in the years to come.",Null,0,1,12 December 2019
Resident Evil," One of the cornerstones of horror genre
","Resident Evil franchise has quite frankly gotten out of hand. At the moment there are five movies made and a sixth in the making. Not all of them are that good, but most of them wouldn't exist if not for this film's good qualities and success.Resident Evil benefits from an interesting setting, full of creeping zombies and other monstrosities, as well as from some really nice actors doing their best to breath life into this video game adaptation. Both Milla Jovovich and Michelle Rodriguez are perfect fit for their respective roles and really nail the tough action woman ideal. And yes, none of the characters in this film are all that deep or have good lines of dialogue, but such a flaw can be forgiven if the horror works well. And it does. The zombies are suitably scary, The Red Queen is unbelievably unnerving, the rest of the monsters, both supernatural and human, are a genuine threat and as a whole the film has a good claustrophobic feel to it. Would it have been better with more rounded characters and better dialogues? Of course, but it's not bad as it is.Aside from the characters, the film's biggest weakness, to me at least, is the fact that sometimes the video game shines through a bit too much. They make a commendable effort to make the film its own creation, but there are certain scenes, which just scream 'a boss fight' or 'a platforming section'. Minor things really, but they do take away from the experience.As a whole Resident Evil is a lot of fun. It's actually scary because of its excellent premise and setting, because of its atmosphere and because it doesn't rely solely on jump scares. Definitely worth checking out for any fan of zombies and/or horror in general.",Null,1,2,16 June 2014
Avengers: Endgame," Movie unlike any other
","So, an era has ended. It began with Iron Man in 2008 and now the story of the Avengers has come to an end. There will be Marvel movies after this one. Spider-Man: Far from Home is coming out this very summer. But in a very real sense this is an end to that initial line-up. I even wonder if we're going to have Avengers 5.The story picks up a few weeks after The Snap. Thanos has won and half of all living creatures in the universe have been dusted. Bleak times for everybody. But, after some hard times and setbacks, a new plan emerges. A bold plan. A crazy plan. A plan unlike any other.The film works. It pays homage to the previous 21 films and the whole Marvel Cinematic Universe. It finds a way to give respect to all the great things that have led us to this point, while still working as a standalone film. Not that you should see this film on its own. This is very much the culmination of a saga. It's not required to have seen all of MCU before seeing this one, but it sure does help. A lot.Furthermore, it's much more fulfilling to watch this movie as a diehard Marvel fan. It's a very fanservicy film, full of reverences, callbacks and little cameos. It is an amazing film even without them, full of amazing action scenes, great character moments and mind-blowing special effects. But it truly shines as an ending. If you've seen all the previous films. If you've grown to love these characters. If you've invested yourself in this universe. Then it becomes something life-defining. It becomes a cornerstone. A feature of culture. Something that will be talked about for generations.A very good film on its own. A great movie. But when you take into account the enormity of the MCU, it becomes something unlike anything else. I wonder if I will ever see a movie like this one in my lifetime. I hope so, but it is not a given.

Dirty Dancing," You'll never love someone like you did when you were 17 years old
","It's the summer of 1963 and young Frances 'Baby' Houseman (Jennifer Grey) is attending a resort with her parents and her older sister. There she ends up hanging out with the staff of the resort and meeting an older dance instructor named Johnny Castle (Patrick Swayze). Trials and tribulations ensue.A movie that most people have at least heard about. One of the most well-known movies of the 80s and still something of a classic with certain gender and age demographics. Personally, being an adult male, I don't belong in any of them, but I have to admit the movie was not half bad.And a lot of that is due to how earnest the film is. Sure, the plot is not overly complicated, the characters are kind of clich√©d and the ending is insultingly predictable, but it has a lot of passion behind it. Both Grey and Swayze are giving it their all and that shows. They also have a surprising amount of chemistry, which is pretty much the selling point of these types of movies. I also like how progressive it is, especially for its time.You also can't forget the soundtrack, including a lot of songs that are still played today.Then again, the plot is so basic that it almost edges into a parody. The movie is also a bit tamer than I expected, given how people rave about it. Not necessarily a bad thing, but it's a thing to keep in mind. It's also a movie about equality and not dividing people into classes. But it's also one of the whitest movies I've seen in a while. Again, it's progressive for its time, but it's also over thirty years old.Still, I can see why people like it.

The Dirty Dozen," This is what The Expendables should have been
","An old WW II film, but still one of the best war movies I've ever seen. The all-time ensemble cast helps, the film has just the right amount of humour and action mixed in and the pacing is actually pretty decent with a clear three act structure. Nowadays the idea of putting together a ragtag bunch of misfits and giving them an almost impossible task to complete is nothing new. We have seen it in The Expendables, we have seen it in the Inglourious Basterds, we have seen it in the Armageddon, but this film predates all of those and is actually one of the better adaptations of the said idea. All the team members have clear identities, especially the key members all have amazing actors to play them and they have genuine chemistry. So, if the characters and the plot work, then what doesn't work? Well, while the plot itself holds up pretty decently, the premise of the film is a bit far-fetched. The mission the dirty dozen is given is one that isn't really suited to their expertise and isn't anything that couldn't have been handled by the real Special Ops. It would have made a bit more sense had the dozen had a common theme between themselves. Perhaps they all could have been former commandos or perhaps demolition experts. Now they were just inmates. But, I'm nitpicking here, as it doesn't really take away from the film. This film is more about the characters and the action. It's not supposed to be a war documentary, it's supposed to be entertainment. And that it certainly is.",Null,0,1,13 January 2012
Gone with the Wind," An epic movie in every meaning of the word
","One of the most well-known films even today. Still the highest-grossing film ever released if you account for inflation. A grand epic about the times of American Civil War and how it affected a group of Southern landed gentry.Starring the indomitable Vivien Leigh as Scarlett O'Hara, the oldest daughter and presumed heir of the Tara plantation, and Clark Gable as Rhett Butler, her on and off mentor slash rival slash romantic interest. The story revolves around Scarlett in the months leading up to the Civil War and in the years that followed. And what a character. Very few movies I've seen in my life I have been able to call Films with a capital F. But this belongs on that elusive list.I find it especially intriguing how jaded they portray Scarlett. She is not a pleasant person, not at all. She's scheming, manipulative, almost purely after her own interest and she most certainly does not take a no for an answer. And yet the scene just before the interlude, where she swears that she and hers shall never suffer like they have suffered, is one of the strongest scenes I've ever see put on film. And the reason for that is the fact that you can understand where she is coming from. Likable she may not be. Admirable, on the other hand, oh so very much.And it's not like she's a pure villain or a monster either. She is not immune to the suffering of others, she is loyal to those she considers hers and her sheer willpower and force of personality are certainly something to be praised.She's also beautifully set up and contrasted by those around her. From Rhett Butler's more relaxed scheming to Melanie's (Olivia de Havilland) straight up sainthood.The only real problem I have with the film is the way it shows its age. More specifically the way it portrays slaves. It is told from the point of view of the South, and it tends to portray slaves as a simpler people, who are being gently looked after by their white masters. More often than not the slaves are shown either as people of limited understanding or as straight up mentally handicapped. It usually isn't the focus of the film, but the story is about the Civil War so it's always on the background. And it is uncomfortable, to tell the truth.Aside from that, the film is really good. A masterpiece. Masterfully acted, masterfully scripted, masterfully made. It is hard to recommend a film almost eighty years old and almost four hours in length to anyone. But in this case I believe the recommendation is more than warranted.",Null,6,9,24 June 2018
District 9," New style and ideas
","District 9 rides the Blair Witch Project wave in that it heavily utilizes the mock documentary style the aforementioned film popularized some years ago. It also tries new things with its basic premise, putting actual aliens in the position of aliens, as in immigrants. It's a fascinating idea and will naturally allow for a lot of new directions from which to examine the old problem and dilemma.I only wish it had stuck with that basic idea. Because now it seems that they came up with this great idea, but instead of doing a social commentary or even a satire, they decided to shoot an action film. And sure, an action film can comment on current society as well, but it simply cannot do it as well because you need to make room for gun fights and explosions.But, don't get me wrong. The gun fights and explosions are nice. This is a good science fiction film. The special effects are topnotch, the alien designs are creative (though, why always bugs), the action works well and the actors are talented. Though I do admit that I find Sharlto Copley's accent to be a bit thick, but at least it's memorable.District 9 divides opinions. Those that are looking for a good scifi action film with a clever premise will absolutely love it. Unfortunately, those that have listened to the hype and come in expecting a modern classic, a revolution, will be somewhat disappointed. Absolutely worth seeing, but do come in with an open mind.",Null,0,0,16 April 2015
Mamma Mia!," Good for what it's worth
","I used to love ABBA when I was just a boy. Their music was extremely cheerful, easy to listen, catchy and it just made you want to dance. So, while musicals aren't exactly my personal cup of tea, I went into this film with a smile on my face. And, I can't say that it disappointed. I wouldn't exactly call this a good film, as the execution is rather corny, the story is predictable and some of the characters consist of a singular stereotype. But, the thing is that the movie doesn't need to be anything more than a well-good film. It is its purpose and it succeeds spectacularly. The songs all work, and I was actually kind of amazed how they managed to fit all of them in and tell a coherent story at the same time, but then, I believe that we can thank the original stage musical for that. Very nicely done in any case. Furthermore, most the actors are very talented with special mention going to the mom-daughter duo that is Meryl Streep and Amanda Seyfried. Many of the best scenes in this film revolve around the relationship between these two.The movie isn't without its faults, though. The story, as mentioned, is nice enough on its own, but it's also very predictable and, dare I say, mushy. This film's reputation as one THE chick flicks is well-earned, which isn't a bad thing in itself, but the dudes and ladettes should be forewarned. The movie's biggest concern, though, are some of the characters and the actors playing them. Like the two old friends of Meryl Streep's character, whose main characteristic seems to be that they like to party. Sure they are there for Streep, but I still got the impression that it was more because they wanted to start drinking already. The love interest of Amanda Seyfried didn't leave much of an impression either.Still, I must admit that I liked this film in sort of a guilty pleasure kind of way, which is the way that most people like this film, I suppose. And really, the point of this film is ABBA's music and that is brought forward and played out beautifully. The songs are classics, they are catchy, they are performed well and they create their own unique mood to this film. Sure some of the actors leave something to hope for as singers, but the passion and the enjoyment is still there. Pop the DVD in, take your special someone to your arms and just relax. It's cool.",Null,0,0,7 July 2012
The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug," Questionable content, but the production values save a lot
","I honestly and truly love The Lord of the Rings film trilogy. Peter Jackson was a miracle director that suddenly appeared to our collective consciousness and somehow managed to film three films that were pretty much all we had ever wanted from LotR films. All the characters felt just right, the visuals were absolutely gorgeous and Jackson had this gift for selecting just the right scenes and filming them in just the right way so that the films, long as though they were, never felt like they were either too long-winded or too hasty in order to cover more ground quickly. Of course not every decision Jackson made was the right call and there were some things that could have been done better, but as a whole they earned all the hype they received.Alas, it would seem that Jackson cannot repeat this feat a second time. The first Hobbit film wasn't yet so bad. True, the tone was at the same too goofy to function as a proper prequel to the LotR films, yet it was too dark for it really feel like they were adapting a children's book to the silver screen. Jackson tried for the middle road and in the process didn't fully please either of the camps. This same problem continues in the second Hobbit film, in which all of Jackson's worst tendencies from the previous films come back with vengeance. The adoration of elves above all else (I'm looking at you Legolas), his disdain for dwarfs (they're more than comic reliefs, you know) and overly choreographed fight scenes (there's really no tension in it when your first reaction is to laugh at just how absurd some of the fight moves are). And this time Jackson even covers some new ground by starting to skip over certain scenes that all fans had been waiting for in order for him to add in new non-canon content that wasn't wanted or needed. Admittedly some of it works, like the upgrade to the legend of Black Arrow, but some of it falls flat instantly, like the weird romance between an elf and a dwarf. I would have much preferred to spend more time with Beorn instead of spending a single minute with that study in awkwardness.All that being said, I still can't deny that I didn't enjoy the heck out of this film. Most of the cast is still rock solid (McKellen, Freeman, Armitage are especially delightful to watch), the visuals are at worst just merely beautiful and at best they're mind-blowingly gorgeous. I was somewhat dreading the introduction of Smaug in this film, but he turned out okay. Not sure I understand why they with a wyvern-style design for him when the original Smaug in Tolkien's drawings clearly isn't one, but that's me nitpicking.Furthermore, the action scenes, while more than a bit silly and non-threatening, do look nice and are pleasant to follow. And as stated, some of the new additions are genuinely interesting and patch up some of the inconsistencies and flights of fantasy of the original book. It's a shame that we have to take all these good inventions with the bad ones.Is it worth watching? If you've liked the films so far, then sure, you'll get your fix of Middle-Earth from this. If you were dissatisfied with the first Hobbit film, this isn't going to change your mind.",Null,1,1,13 January 2014
The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford," Pretty to look at, very intense from time to time, but also very slow
","The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford is based on the novel of the same name by Ron Hansen, which in turn is based on real events that took place in the late 1800s. The West is slowly dying out, giving room for modern era of industrialization and globalism. And one of the last great folk heroes of that era was the train robber Jesse James. This is the story of his demise. As you might have surmised from the title.Directed by Andrew Dominik, with Roger Deakins as the cinematographer, it's certainly a very pretty film. The West is brought in front of your eyes in all of its empty glory. With its vast fields, its endless space, with the distant sun painting everything in shades of dust and wheat. The camera work and lighting are also spectacular, especially in the opening train robbing scene. If you like westerns at all, you should definitely see this film for the visuals alone.The acting is also very good. Casey Affleck as Robert Ford, the main character, has that smarmy quality to him. You can instantly see that this guy is faking his bravado, putting on airs, trying to fill shoes that are way too big. But he thinks he's pulling it off, and is so annoyingly smug about it. This is a guy you wanna slap on general principle. Which makes it all the more interesting when the movie starts to work at making him sympathetic.But real top notch acting in this movie is done by Brad Pitt as Jesse James. I would have liked to see more of this character. Now you get the sense that people believe he's a myth, a legend. A man that quiets the room simply by walking in. Because he's that dangerous. You can see it, but you don't quite have time to believe it yourself, because we don't spend enough time with him. Pitt convinces us by his acting, but it's not enough to really sink in. Yet at the same time the movie talks about him a lot. About how he was larger than life and a feature of American cultural consciousness at that time. And how much his death shook people. You hear about it, but you don't believe it because so much time is spent with Ford.Which might make it seem baffling when I say that this film is a slow one. Because if it's a slow and long one, where was the not-Ford time spent if not on Jesse? Well, on landscapes, Ford's relatives, more landscapes, interior shots, landscapes... Things like that. And it looks pretty. It looks real pretty. But perhaps they could have cut a few of the establishing landscape shots and focused more on Jesse's status as a legend. Might have made Ford's eventual fate more coherent for us. Because there's a reason the title of the film paints Ford as a coward. It demeans him for killing a train robber. Think about that.Still, the film has its merits. Definitely a film I will remember, for the imagery alone if nothing else. It has its flaws as well, being far from perfect, but nevertheless I'd say it's worth a watch.",Null,1,1,3 October 2019
Toy Story 4," Didn't know I wanted this movie until I saw it
","I have to admit I groaned when I saw the announcement for this movie. The ending to Toy Story 3 had been perfect. Well okay, it had the capability to induce diabetes two state lines away, but it was a good ending to the trilogy. No additional hijinks needed. But, it made a lot of money, so perhaps I shouldn't have been surprised that Disney/Pixar wanted to return to this golden egg goose.But, credit where credit is due, they did a good job with this one. This is an excellent continuation to the Toy Story franchise. Love and care have obviously been spent in plentiful abundance and the people behind the story obviously wanted to make this as good as they could.And I liked it. Sure, it's once again the toys trying to get home to their owner. Like in every single other Toy Story film. But once again they do something different with it. For some reason this repetitiveness doesn't bother me in this franchise unlike everywhere else.The characters once again feel intriguing, familiar and achingly flawed. None of them are perfect, especially not Woody, who's once again single-mindedly bulldozing his way through emotional issues. Like in every other film, but in a different manner. Once again. How does this franchise do this? It shouldn't work.I also really like Bo Peep as a returning character. Easily the MVP of the character roster.So there you have it. Toy Story 4 is not only a good movie, it's actually easily on par with all the rest of the films in its franchise. I wouldn't be surprised at all if this became the favourite Toy Story film for some people.",Null,0,0,8 March 2020
Batman Begins," How to do an origin story
","I think that the first iteration of Batman I ever saw was the Adam West TV series. You know, the one with nonchanging story lines, Joker with a painted-over mustache, Bat Shark Repellant, and 'Na-na-na-na- na Batman' theme. Boy, have we come a long way since then. Christopher Nolan revolutionized the character. Tim Burton's version had already brought back the dark shadows, the heavy themes of duality and fighting enemies of your own making, the brooding and the melancholy. But Nolan took all that and updated it to the modern day. Suddenly it felt surprisingly plausible that someone might make the choice to fight crime dressed as a giant bat.This is also one of the first films in ages to show as the origin of Batman. I mean, we all know the story. Bruce Wayne is the golden son of Gotham, but then his parents get killed in a random mugging and once he grows up he takes up the moniker of Batman to strike fear into the hearts of those that have terrified him so much. But we usually start long after he has become Batman. And the question often remains: Where did the learn all that? Sure, he's wealthy beyond belief so getting all kinds of gadgets is certainly possible, but you don't really learn to fight like he does without some form of training. And in this movie we get to see that training. And it is very entertaining and makes for a great cinematic experience, especially with Nolan directing. His nonlinear storytelling and visual style compliment the story perfectly and once Bruce Wayne begins his war against crime, he gives us a great version of one of the best villains Batman has ever had.It's also a well-acted film with Christian Bale stepping into the boots of Bruce Wayne and Batman. I do think that he is a bit better Bruce Wayne than he is Batman and this is definitely the film where he gets to be Bruce Wayne the most, but his Batman isn't all that bad by any means. Even the infamous voice isn't as bad as people make it out to be, especially in this first film. And the supporting cast is equally great, with Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman giving us their absolutely A-game as Alfred and Lucius Fox, respectively. Not to mention Gary Oldman as Commissioner Gordon, though his best moments are still ahead in the next film.Batman Begins is one of my favourite superhero films and one of my all-time favourites in general as well. Definitely my go-to example on how to tell an origin story. Check it out if you haven't already.",Null,1,2,7 March 2016
The Fault in Our Stars," Bittersweet and darkly humorous love story
","I have not in fact read the book, so this review is based solely on the merits of the film on its own. And I gotta admit, it's a fine movie. Sure the whole message of the film is a touch convoluted as it all starts with the whole speech about how this is not some overly romantic love story coated in saccharine. And yet it kind of is, at least it starts to be as soon as we meet Augustus (Ansel Elgort), one of the savviest, most perfect 18-year-olds ever seen in cinema. And yet that dichotomy doesn't really bother me, because teenagers do that. They think their sufferance is special, unique, and they draw strength from that. It feels real that way.As a whole this is one of the most touching love stories I've seen in a while. A lot of that is due to the phenomenal chemistry between Elgort and Shailene Woodley, playing the main character Hazel. You totally buy that these teens are in love and the movie wastes no time in getting them together, starting the saccharine. In some movies this would be rather Disney-esque, but here it seems more like a stylistic choice. Like they wanted to focus on the actual relationship instead of how it started. And that relationship is very fine. Full of sarcastic humour, snarkiness, tenderness and some really good conversations, it's a romance you won't get tired of watching, no matter your age or gender.The script is also very well paced, the rest of the cast is equally talented, the story contains enough joy and sorrow to reach you and as a whole it's a pleasant way to spend an evening. Definitely recommended for all. And now I kind of have to read the book as well.",Null,0,1,29 November 2014
Wreck-It Ralph," Surprisingly good story and not just a gimmick movie
","A rather big racket was raised when we first heard that Disney had acquired the rights to all these classic video game characters and was in the process of making a movie about them. What was the story going to be right, were our beloved characters going to be treated fairly, who was going to be in it? Well, as it turns out, we barely get to see any of them. Most of the good parts were in the trailers. And, in my opinion, that's good.This is an original story, utilizing mostly original characters and fictional video games, but with a background of classic games and characters. And that feels right. The story is set in an arcade, where after the lights turn off for the night, the various characters from all of the games gather and spend time together. One of these characters is Wreck-It-Ralph, from the made-up game Fix-It- Felix, Jr. - a pretty blatant Donkey Kong rip-off, but in a loving manner. Villains are treated with quite a large amount of disdain by the other characters, and Ralph feels like he doesn't get the respect he deserves. He is in many ways the second most important character in the game, but the others treat him like dirt. So he leaves, trying to find recognition elsewhere.And from thereon out it's exactly what you've come to expect from Disney. Great characters, great visuals, good morals and lessons, exciting adventures and even a decent twist near the end. Ralph meets a young racer girl character named Vanellope in his travels and these two are very funny together. Ralph's way more gruff and jaded, but also somewhat wiser because his game has been around for so much longer, whereas Vanellope is much more willing to push the boundaries and able to roll with the punches, never letting anywhere stop her.Is it a perfect film? No. Personally I'm somewhat disappointed that we only get to see three games, when we had to whole arcade to explore. From the story point of view it makes sense because it always takes time to establish a new setting, but it still feels like they didn't explore all the possibilities. The secondary characters, mainly Felix and his love interest, are also somewhat boring in my opinion, though they have their moments as well.Nevertheless, it's still overall great entertainment and an excellent addition to the Disney canon.",Null,0,1,10 July 2016
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," Immensely enjoyable
","I don't understand the critics' reaction to this film. Well, I can accept some of their criticism, but I still feel that they're judging this film far too harshly. Perhaps it's the hype that quite frankly got blown out of proportions, or perhaps they reacted negatively to the decision to separate a simple children's story into three films, or perhaps they just expected another epic on par with The Lord of the Rings saga.And I cannot claim I wasn't equally as cautious, having seen the trailers, knowing the book and realizing that they would have to add a lot of padding. So I was prepared to be disappointed. Luckily, my fears were ill-founded and what I received was an adventure I haven't experienced since the original LotR films. A sentence written by a fellow fan sums up my feelings perfectly: 'It felt like coming home after a long journey.' Exactly. And yes, I realize that as a major Tolkien fan my viewpoint is heavily biased, but that's what this film does to you. It has its flaws, but I just cannot bring myself to care. It's Middle-earth.But don't get me wrong, it's not good just because it's Middle-earth. It's a genuinely great film on its own. And this wasn't an easy story to adapt into a film, especially when you want to make it a prequel to the LotR films. Because the original book in all honestly doesn't work as a prequel to the LotR books all that well. It's just a merry little children's adventure with humour and high adventure. Some of its events work as a backstory to LotR, but sometimes it feels like it's not even set in the same universe, the tone is so different. So adaptation was always going to cause controversy, because there isn't a good compromise to be had. Personally I think that Jackson strikes a good balance here. The film is a lot more humorous than the LotR films, but at the same time there are hints of events yet to come and you can pinpoint the certain events that would eventually lead to the War of the Rings and the downfall of Sauron. These scenes tie the film to the greater story and even though the constant shifts in tone might bother someone, I think that Jackson manages to balance the two aspects rather well.What I think Jackson got exactly right are the characters. The returning characters still feel the same, and in some cases even better. Galadriel (Cate Blanchett) and Gollum (Andy Serkis) had improved the most and the scene where Bilbo (Martin Freeman) and Gollum meet is easily the best one in the film. The mood, the atmosphere, the dialogue, the slowly building tension, it's absolutely haunting in quality. And luckily the new characters don't disappoint either. Martin Freeman outshines the rest with a performance that absolutely nails the character of Bilbo Baggins, but the dwarfs aren't bad either. Thorin Richard Armitage) gets the most screen time as he by all means should, which unfortunately though doesn't leave too much time for the rest of them. The same problem exists in the book, so it's not completely Jackson's fault. There simple are too many dwarfs to give them all enough screen time to develop their personalities properly. Jackson tries his best though and I think that he succeeds admirably, given the circumstances. Most of the dwarfs look different enough and all of them have at least one quirk that makes them stand out from the rest. You still can't tell which one was Nori and which one Ori by the end of the film, but you at least have an inclination about most of them. It's not much, but it's something.Nevertheless, the characters do work. The other thing that I liked is the score, because well, it's Howard Shore, and even if we discount that I still find myself humming the main theme under my breath, and its been almost two weeks. I also quite liked the action, which once again reflected the more humorous tone of the film. It was flashy, fast-paced and filled with a lot of creativity. Sure some might claim that it was more silly than anything, but I think that it fitted and at least it was enjoyable to watch, especially from a big screen. And of course the visuals are still some of the best the industry has to offer. The sweeping landscapes of New Zealand looked good back then and they still do. The monsters and various caves and buildings are equally awe-inspiring and a lot of time has been spent on the details.Then the grievances and the nitpicking. The biggest complain that I have against this film is the voice acting. The orcs and goblins in LotR films sounded great with lots of growling and screeching, with sharp gutturals. And the orcs in The Hobbit still sound like that, but the trolls and especially the goblins are just unbelievably bad. A humongous goblin king should not sound like an educated middle-aged British merchant. It completely ruins the effect. But if that's the worst I can say about this film, well... it's a nitpick if even that. There were some other minor points that I would have personally changes, mostly dealing with changes to the story, but nothing major or anything that could have potentially ruined the film.As a whole it's a very strong film. The tone is a bit of a problem and it has too many characters, but what it gets right, it gets absolutely right. It's Jackson's Middle-earth and I like it very, very much. Is it as good as the LotR films? Not quite, but it isn't far away. I saw it once and I walked back in the next day with a smile on my face. That's about the biggest compliment I can pay to a film and this film more than deserved it.",Null,9,21,24 December 2012
Before Sunset," We change as we grow older
","A sequel to Richard Linklater's Before Sunrise and a true testament to the virtue of patience. Filmed nine years after the first film, with the trilogy's third installment Before Midnight again jumping nine years into the future. And like in real life, nine years have also passed since the events of Sunrise.Jesse and C√©line, played by Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy, have not seen each other since the events of the first film, but now Jesse is finishing his book tour in Paris and runs into C√©line in a bookstore. The whole film is simply their conversation from beginning to end as they walk the streets and parks of Paris. And it is fascinating.Before Sunrise was already a good film. Especially in how it portrayed the age of its main characters. They were adults, if only barely, but not yet old enough to be comfortable in their skins, in their world views. I also truly appreciated how they were mostly attracted to each other's personalities and not just their respective looks.That is present here, as well, but once again their age is reflected really well. These two have lived, have learned, have grown, but they still connect very easily with one another. There is earning to be with one another, because they get each other so well, but there's also caution brought on by live experience and past mistakes.And perhaps it's because I'm closer in age to the characters of this film, but I felt much more in tune with these two than I did when they were still in their very late teens. It's also fascinating that my favourite character has changed from C√©line to Jesse. This time it's C√©line that has views and attitudes that slightly annoy me, whereas before it was Jesse that was a bit too full of himself for my liking. Not that they're at all unlikable in either of the films, but they have clearly changed. And that feels real.Whereas Sunrise gave us a vision of perfection, of day dreams and hopes for the future, Sunset shows what might really be possible. Sure its plot and events are a bit movie-like in their sheer serendipity, but they still end up feeling more grounded. Very good romance film, no matter how you measure it.",Null,1,1,14 October 2018
The Princess Bride," Clever and fun fantasy film
","One of the most well-known and respected fantasy films and for a good reason. The Princess Bride is a genre-defining film that has endured the test of time beautifully and still stands as one of the best adventure films and the one film you should see if you're interested in swashbuckler films.What I like the most about this film is its unpredictability. Sure, it's an adventure film aimed for all audiences, so the good guys are going to win and all that, but the way they go about accomplishing that task is what makes this film enjoyable. You're never sure what's going to happen next, the characters are very creative and there are a lot of them, the plot twists come right out of nowhere and the humorous tongue-in-cheek tone ties it all together. There is drama and high stages, yes, but it's still an adventure film and meant to be enjoyed with a smile on your face.The story develops rather erratically, going from one scene to another with very few tie-ins, but in this case it works, because the whole film is told more like a fairy tale than a typical story. So it's more of a preference of style than a flaw.If I were to nitpick, I'd say that the frame story involving a grandfather reading his grandson a book while he lies sick in bed is not as interesting as the actual story and sometimes the kid's interruptions in the story come at the worst possible times. This is only a nitpick, however, because the banter between these two is actually quite humorous, which keeps it from becoming an annoyance. It'd be interesting to see just how well the actual adventure would flow without the frame story, just for comparison.I like this film, I like a lot. It has a strong story, it's fun and charming without being immature, its characters are great, it has a lot of memorable dialogues and as a whole it's just bursting with imagination. One of the best adventure films I've ever seen and well worth your time, whoever you happen to be.",Null,2,3,11 June 2013
How to Train Your Dragon 2," Worthy sequel
","Five years have passed since the events of the first film and dragons still soar over the skies of Berk. Hiccup (Jay Baruchel), still the most oddly named viking ever, and his trusty dragon Toothless have expanded the map of the surrounding lands, finding new lands and dragons for the village to enjoy. Yet new threats lurk around the corner as Hiccup and Astrid (America Ferrera) come across dragon trappers working for a mysterious warlord.What How to Train your Dragon 2 gets extremely right is avoiding the usual sequel clich√©s. The story is entirely new, not just the original with a new villain, there are no aggravating wrinkles in the romance, no old problems resurfacing. The world of Berk has evolved due to the events of the first film and the characters have grown during the five years. Immensely satisfying and all of the characters, dragons included, still feel familiar and identifiable, yet you can see time has passed.The technical aspects are also once again topnotch. The flying scenes are amazing, the world is full of details and nuances, the facial expressions look believable and smooth and even the 3D doesn't detract from the experience like it usually does. The score is also very impressive and supports the film perfectly. Some really hauntingly beautiful and/or uplifting melodies.All that being said, it's not a perfect film. I applaud the film makers for having the guts to forward the story and take it to new directions, but it still has a few kinks. There are a few plot twists I could see coming miles away because they were foreshadowed so heavily and awkwardly. In addition, the villain is pretty weak. Djimon Hounsou gives him a lot of presence with his voice, but overall he's not that interesting of a character. His motivations are pretty see-through, his plan is clich√©d and full of plot holes, and even his design is pretty basic.On the other hand Cate Blanchett's character is superb. Warmhearted, capable, beautiful, a little kooky, wise, everything the character needed to be to shine. The scenes between her and Hiccup are easily the best in the film and I truly appreciated her inclusion, even though beforehand I had dreaded her based on the trailers. Fortunately I was proved wrong.How to Train Your Dragon 2 doesn't quite reach the level of its predecessor. The first one had a tighter story and the novelty on its side. Its sequel is still one of the best Dreamworks films made to date and pretty much guarantees a sequel, which is great.",Null,1,6,13 July 2014
The Pianist," Harrowing tale
","Roman Polanski's The Pianist has earned recognition as one of the best films about Holocaust ever made. And for a good reason. Based on the memoirs of Wladyslaw Szpilman, it tells the story of him and his family trying to survive through the World War while at first harassed and then outright hunted by the Nazi government. It is the tale of Holocaust seen through one human fate. And while Szpilman's experiences were not the worst ones imaginable ‚Äì if such things should even be measured ‚Äì they are among the more unbelievable, showcasing his resilience, will to survive, and at times sheer dumb luck.Szpilman is played by Adrien Brody, and this is by far the best performance he has ever given. The role fits him like a glove, or perhaps it would be better to say that he fits the role like a glove, it's hard to say. Nevertheless, it's him that pulls you into the movie, into the journey through years filled with naught else but hardship, destruction, smoke and sorrow, with only brief moments of elusive hope. One of the more well-earned Academy Awards, I must say.Polanki's Academy Award for Directing was also well-earned in my opinion. Polanski's films have always had certain flair to them, an unmistakable style, but in this he has left out all of his usual lightheartedness and channeled all of his talent into making you see what it was really like to live through it all. And he succeeded. The pacing is iron tight and professional, the whole film looks amazing, all the scenes are poignant and interesting, all the dialogues work magnificently, all the characters are identifiable and memorable. Easily the best film from him I've seen.All in all The Pianist is the only film I've encountered that can stand as an equal next to Schindler's List as a film about the Holocaust. A modern classic.",Null,0,0,7 September 2015
The Grand Budapest Hotel," Fantastically unorthodox
","A movie hearkening back to the days between the World Wars, to a time where properness, good manners and dignity still reigned supreme. All in good fun, of course. The Grand Budapest Hotel is the best kind of comedy because it refuses to admit it's one. The events are humorous, of course, as are the character, but those characters always act seriously, as if the bizarre things happening around them are the norm. There's no winking at the audience, except on a story level.The humour is also more intelligent than in most Hollywood comedies. It can play with your expectations and pulls its laughs not from lowbrow jokes but from absurdity, straight man routines and from developed character traits. There's no clowning around, rather adult people are made to look silly when the movie starts pulling apart their everyday routines and revealing the hilarity underneath.It's also a gorgeous movie on all levels. The camera work is superb and the whole movie has a fantastical visual style that both strengthens the jokes along with providing a plethora of its own. The talented cast also deserves a special mention. Ralph Fiennes shines as M. Gustave, a peculiar hotel owner known for his eccentricities and impeccable manners. Such a delightful character and his sheer poise is the source of most of the humour.The Grand Budapest Hotel is a must see for all Wes Anderson fans and all of those that want to see a comedy with wit, style and finesse.",Null,6,10,22 November 2014
Tucker and Dale vs Evil," Plays its markers a bit too early
","Tucker and Dale vs Evil has a great premise. What if those crazy backwoods hillbillies - who are probably cannibals - you see in every other horror movie were actually the victims of the film? Now that's pure gold right there.And the early scenes of this film have some really great jokes, stemming from that initial idea. There's an especially great scene involving a chainsaw and a wasp nest, which caused me to crack myself up. If this film could have kept up such quality throughout its entire run-time, we would be talking about a new horror comedy cult classic.Unfortunately all the best jokes are in the initial half of the film. The second half loses a lot of its humour - although it makes up for it a little bit with surprising amounts of heartwarming - and becomes a more straightforward horror slasher film.Not helping the matters is the actual villain of the movie, who's so over the top psycho that it doesn't make any sense that he would be able to function in a normal society. This is a dude who would stand in the corner of a party, openly licking a knife, cackling while he does it. How are these other people friends with him? Sure, it's supposed to be a joke how over the top he is, but it just doesn't make any sense. The film would have worked fine without his psychosis. Just let it be a movie about a huge, colossal misunderstanding. Like the first half of the film.Still, the film has passion and charm behind it. Some of the jokes are really good, as are somewhat surprisingly some of the characters. The villain is terrible, but who knows, you might like how bat guano bonkers he is.",Null,0,1,29 January 2020
Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol," Tightly written, exciting spy action thriller
","The live-action directorial debut of Brad Bird, mostly known for his animated feature films, such as The Iron Giant and The Incredibles. And if you've seen those films, you know that Bird is passionate about the spy genre. As such it made perfect sense for him to helm a film in one of the biggest spy franchises there is.Tom Cruise returns as Ethan Hunt, spy master extraordinaire. This time he and his team are on the run as their organization disavows them after a mission gone wrong. So it's up to them and them alone to stop the end of the world by nuclear annihilation.What I like the most about this film are its locations and how tightly it's written. We travel all across the world and every single location is new, exciting, iconic and filled with superb action scenes. This is a film that makes me think that we should give more action films to animation directors. Bird has this fantastic way of filming stuff that really pulls you in. You always feel like you're there, in the room, with the heroes. And you can follow what they're doing and why they're doing it without the film having to cram it down your throats with exposition. The film's heavy reliance on practical effects only helps.And it's a superbly written film. From the very first scene we're back in business. The scenes build on top of one another and there's nary a moment or line of dialogue wasted. Very much a movie that rewards its viewers when they pay attention. Once again, the film is surprisingly light on exposition, yet you can follow it just fine. And that's harder to pull off than you'd think.Fantastic film. Easily my favourite Mission Impossible film and probably my favourite spy film in general. Give Brad Bird all the projects from now on.",Null,0,1,11 February 2020
28 Days Later...," New style of zombie horror
","In many ways this film lead the way for the new age of zombie horror. It's a film that takes its setting seriously and treats it with dignity and forethought. No longer are we supposed to fear zombies that shuffle ridiculously slowly through open fields where we can see them coming miles away. These zombies are vicious, fast and absolutely brutal in their search for human flesh. This idea had been seen before, but this film helped to popularize it and nowadays it's pretty much the norm for zombie flicks, which is great in my opinion as it increases the horror and makes the film more exciting, because you know that in physical confrontation with these zombies you'd almost surely lose.I also liked how they treat the human aspects of a zombie apocalypse. This was one of the first films of its kind where the true horror didn't come from the undead or the infected, as they are called, but rather from the other survivors. The zombies are a plague, a force of nature, in that they're utterly predictable and unable to reason or to be reasoned with. They're scary and to be avoided, but they're not malignant in a true sense of the word. Rather they're just driven by their instincts. Humans, on the other hand, are capable of true malignancy. They're capable of making the right choice, but they often get distracted by their urges and will make wrong decisions, quite often believing that they're justified in their behaviour. And that's what makes this film truly terrifying: watching as the last vestiges of civilizations bend, crack and crumble under impossible odds.So the basic story is good, it's very good. I also liked the main actors, who all felt like wholesome characters with their own motivations and urges. They also managed to grew and flourish throughout the story and none of them ended the story as the same as they had started, which is always a good sign. On the other hand, the antagonists felt rather hollow. They didn't grow all that much and we didn't learn anything worthwhile about them. They were just there to provide suspension and threat.The visual style of this film is something that divides opinions. It's rather bleak and other-worldly, with strong vibrant colours clashing with shades of brown, grey and black. It looks dirty and unpleasant, which fits the tone of the story, but is still somewhat hard to look at for prolonged periods of time. I didn't particularly care for it - except for few particular scenes - but I get its purpose. They way the film is shot also manages to save a lot. Lots of weird camera angles and clever settings make the film interesting to follow.In the end this is a zombie film that every fan of the genre should see. It's not the greatest in its genre by a long shot, but it has good character, suitably brutal action scenes and few storytelling tricks that have since become extremely popular, largely thanks to this film.",Null,0,1,17 November 2012
City of God," Effectively brutal
","Based on a novel by Paulo Lins who based the plot on real events having taken place in a favela, Brazilian slum, called City of God. The story is one of lost, unforgiving odds, bleak chances, little to no chance of escaping and of friends turned enemies.City of God is a unique experience and a unique film. Only a couple of the actors had had any prior acting experience, all of them in relatively minor roles. All of the rest, including all the main actors, were picked from actual favelas, many of them from the actual City of God. And yet, if I hadn't been told this, I couldn't have told. They're that good, that deep into their characters, and they bring this manic energy into everything they do on screen. You can sense the raw emotions churning under their skin, because they've been there. They know what it's like.The film doesn't pull any punches either. It tells the story about young street punks, looking their slice of heaven and riches through robbery, drug dealing, racketing, murder and mayhem. It doesn't shy away from the harsh realities, it doesn't try to sugarcoat it, nor does it offer any excuses.Aside from the unprofessional actors, the rest of the film is very professional. The cinematography is brilliant, as is the whole style, the whole vibrant yet muddy feel they give to the City. The story spans about a decade of time, yet it feels cohesive, like we never lose anything because of a jump in time.City of God is unforgiving. It's brutal, bloody, unpleasant and showcases that we still have a long way to go as a species. But we need films like it exactly for that last part. We need to be shown what's still wrong with the world. And I admire this film for having to guts to do just that.",Null,1,3,11 October 2014
Cars," Your most unenthusiastic Owen Wilson 'Wow!' here...
","Cars is the story of Lightning McQueen (Owen Wilson), a race car on the brink of glory, who gets separated from his pit crew on the way to his big race in California. He ends up stranded in a small rural town along the legendary Route 66. Will he learn to cherish the American values of working hard and respecting his fellow human... cars?Does the Pope have a balcony?Cars is not a terrible film. It has the reputation of being the first 'bad' Pixar film, but there is an argument to be made that it merely isn't great instead of being outright bad. Which in Pixar terms makes it bad, but you get the point.What bothers me the most with this film is the fact that it is such an odd idea. How are these cars made? Are there any baby cars? If yes, where do they come from? What's inside these living breathing cars? Do they bleed? How do they build all these elaborate locations and place all these tiny little things on shelves, seeing as they don't have any hands? Can a car feel pain?The universe is simply one neat idea that's never examined properly. My friends and I spent far too much time riffing on all the implausibilities of the movie universe. Sure it passed the time, but we ended up missing most of the story. That's how little we cared.And it's not like the story is anything to write home about. It's your typical story about a hotshot guy stranded in a rural setting, learning a valuable lesson about community and hard work. Seen it!Cars is inoffensive and can be shown to kids. Its characters are likable in a very basic way and there's nothing that's outright awful about it. But that's the nicest thing I can say about it. An easy skip, I would say.",Null,0,1,22 March 2019
The Little Mermaid," Something's starting right now
","The end of the 80s was a good time for Disney Studios. They had managed to avoid closing down with The Great Mouse Detective, Oliver & Company had beaten The Land Before Time at the box office, and Who Framed Roger Rabbit had been a huge success. And it's that last movie that would lead directly to the creation of this one, and the beginning of Disney Renaissance, the undisputed Golden Age of Disney Animation. And the reason is that they managed to bring over a lot of the animators that had worked on Roger, thus bringing a lot of new blood and energy into their animation team. Add in the musical virtuoso Alan Menken and you had all the right ingredients for something magical.And this is the first result of all that labour, love and effort. Adapting a story of the same name by Hans Christian Andersen, it tells about a little mermaid - what a twist - named Ariel, the youngest daughter of the sea king. Ariel is the loveliest of the daughters and the one with the most beautiful voice. Nevertheless she's a problematic child to raise, for she's endlessly fascinated by the human world above the waves, which has long been the source of misery for the sea folk. Things start to unravel as Ariel saves a drowning prince from a storm, naturally falling head over heels for this tall, dark stranger. As Disney princesses do.The Little Mermaid is the source and well of a lot of things we have come to accept as Disney hallmarks. The Broadway musical style of songs, the fairy tale structure and source materials, the lavishly lush animation, the humorous side characters, the romance, the prince and the princess, the themes of yearning, acceptance, hope and dreams. Naturally other Disney films had had these things before, but in this film they all came together and took the shape and form we all recognize today.And it's a very good example of that classic Disney formula. Especially on the musical side of things. This film has one of the best soundtracks out of all the Disney films. All the songs are classics, they're all catchy beyond belief and instantly recognizable by any member of modern society. Kiss the Girl is probably my favourite, closely followed by Poor Unfortunate Souls, but they're all great.It's more than likely that you've all already seen this film, but if by some miracle you haven't¬Ö What are you waiting for?",Null,1,1,17 September 2015
Avengers: Infinity War," How can this be so good?
","Quite honestly this shouldn't work. Marvel has been approaching its breaking point for a while now. By conventional wisdom there are too many characters, too many storylines, too many warring threats and points of interest. We could even kind of see it in The Age of Ultron. Too many plot points, too vast a scale, too far-reaching a scope.But somehow Marvel broke through. This is an amazing movie. It is everything that was promised and more. A third installment that actually manages to raise the stakes, to deliver something that feels bigger, grander, more epic than anything we've seen before. And keeping in mind that this is Marvel, and that we have seen some truly astonishing things already, that is saying something.So what exactly did they do to pull this off? Well, for one, they absolutely nailed the villain. Thanos (Josh Brolin) had already been teased multiple times in previous films, but he had always been a big question mark for us. Would he truly be that threatening? Would he actually have the menace, the charisma and the ambition to stand as the biggest threat the Avengers had ever faced? I'm glad to report that he does exactly that, and more. Thanos might very well be the best villain Marvel has ever produced. That is not as high a bar as it perhaps should be, but it's still plenty assuring.The usual tricks are also in full display and they work marvelously. Beautiful CGI, good character moments, lush backgrounds, fun character interactions and a real sense of adventure. Granted, the storyline is one of the grimmest yet seen in Marvel, but that merely makes it all seem worth more.Now, to be fair, this is only the first part. The Infinity War will continue in the next Avengers film. But this is one of those rare Part Ones that manages leave you begging for more. That ending...

"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," Wuxia film to beat all others
","Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, often cited as one of the greatest of its genre, was directed by Ang Lee. The interesting thing here is that he had never directed a wuxia film before this one, nor has he directed one since. He was apparently content to make this one masterpiece, studying the intricacies of its genre, and then move to other projects, other ideas.And we thank him for this one. Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is a wuxia film in its purest form. It's a film about mythical China, where great martial artists walk the Earth and clash against one another. Where old grudges carry from the hands of the masters into those of their students. Where swords are mighty, but in the end it's the hands that wield them that matter.It's a sprawling tale, full of turns, characters and locations. As much of an epic as anything the West has produced in Lawrence of Arabia or Ben-Hur, albeit not taking as much time in-universe. Yet there's weight to the world. The sheer beauty of the production of course helps, but it's also entrenched in culture and history. I don't know enough about Chinese history to comment the accurateness of the film's look, but I can safely say that this is the film I think about whenever this period of time in Chinese history is mentioned. It's that iconic.And of course it has a well-earned reputation as one of the best martial arts films ever made. Sure, some of the fight scenes are pretty out there, jumping from one bamboo branch to another, but the fact that the actors performed most of their own stunts and that the wire work on display is so well-made, gives it heft. And there are some truly great battle scenes happening on the ground where you can feel every blow, grit your teeth with every near miss and gasp in pain whenever a hit is scored. The fight between Michelle Yeoh and Zhang Ziyi in the dojo is especially noteworthy in this regard. Still one of the best fight scenes I've ever seen, even after all these years.One of those rare action films that have a definite serenity to them. A film only two hours long, yet telling a story most TV series would struggle to fit into a season. And making it look breezy and effortless. Easily one of Ang Lee's best and one of those film I can easily name a masterpiece.",Null,1,1,27 October 2019
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," Transcendent
","Every now and then I happen across a film that seems to etch itself into my consciousness and cultural view of the world. These are the cinematic masterpieces that in part build up my identity. They're the films that fill my Top Ten or Twenty lists and which I find myself quoting or using as comparison for other films.What then makes a movie one of my personal cinematic masterpieces? Sometimes it's the story, that razor sharp writing that either keeps surprising me or goes exactly as I want it to go. Sometimes it's a singular character, a realization of a archetype I've formed in my head, given form in the silver screen.In Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon that something is both the world of mystical China with its swaying bamboo forests, meticulously decorated houses and vibrant colours, and it's also the art of human movement, of martial arts and swordplay. For me this film embodies those two things. This is the film I think about whenever either of those topics is brought up. This is the milestone used for comparison.One other things that elevates a film above its peers is the intangible feeling of weight, the feeling of belonging, tradition and history. It's the sense that the camera could walk around any corner, follow any character or even go looking for another story altogether and it would find something. A sense of fullness and realism, even if its a world of fantasy warriors capable of leaping thirty feet in the air with a single jump. And that can only come when everything works together perfectly. The actors have to fully immerse themselves into their roles, the production values and special effects have to convince the viewer, the story has to have enough weight to pull the viewer in without hesitations. This movie has that.It's a fascinating film, a journey unlike any other and well worth taking. One of my personal favourites and definitely an easy recommendation.",Null,0,0,13 January 2014
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Tarantino doing what Tarantino does
","The ninth film from the legendary director Quentin Tarantino - depending on how you count them - and once again we're taken straight into the past, where everyone dresses cooler than you ever will, the music is better, everyone is suave like you wouldn't believe it, violence has a prominent place in society and everything just has that vibe to it.In this particular instance we're in Hollywood. It's the end of the 60s. The hippie movement is going strong, westerns are slowly dying out, narcotics flow freely and there's something in the air. We follow three main characters. Rick Dalton (Leonardo DiCaprio), a fading star of westerns. Cliff Booth (Brad Pitt), his stunt double with some questionable skills. And Sharon Tate (Margot Robbie), Rick's neighbour, who's about the attract the attention of some real bad apples.What separates this from previous Tarantino films is the lack of real plot. Sure, things happen and they even kind of connect in the end, but it's still a very meandering film. For example, pretty much all the Sharon Tate scenes have nothing to do with Rick and Cliff. Or if they do, it's very peripherally. They're still talking about the same city, the same era, the same business, even the same people, but from another perspective.Personally I didn't mind. It's still the same quippy Tarantino stuff I've grown to love, but I can see how it can be a problem for some people.And, truth be told, this is not the best film Tarantino has ever filmed. The lack of structure does mean that it doesn't quite have that edge some of his other films have. That being said, it's still miles and miles above almost anything else to have come out in recent years. It's violent, it's witty, it's cool. It has amazing characters, even better dialogues and some unbelievable scenes. The end fight scene might very well be one of the best Tarantino has ever filmed. If not the best. And that's saying something.Do you like Tarantino? If yes, see the film. If not, it's not going to change your mind.",Null,0,2,27 September 2019
Gone Girl," Did not see it coming
","Nick and Amy Dunne, two struggling writers slash journalists, used to be madly in love. Theirs was a dream marriage, two soulmates who had found one another. In their own words they were so cute you wanted to punch them. But that was in the past. Then Nick's mother got sick and they had to move back to his home town in the middle of nowhere. Now Nick owns a bar bought with her money, she's a loner in the neighbourhood and their relationship has gotten progressively worse. And then she disappears on their anniversary and he becomes the main suspect.Gone Girl was directed by the legendary David Fincher, the man behind Se7en and Fight Club, and it shows. He has moved from the have-nots of the society to the haves, but it's still very clearly his style and skill behind the camera. Every scene is filled with meaning and every scene has tension behind it. Almost like there's always something just behind the counter. You're constantly expecting the pin to fall, for something to go for your throat, for something to happen. And for a psychological thriller, that's a great feeling. And the film in no way disappoints. I absolutely don't want to spoil the plot to you, but trust me when I say that it's going to take you for a ride. There are so many rug pulls in this movie that it'll leave you spinning.That being said, I do think that the first third of the film is a bit tedious. You get to know the people involved, there's some backstory told well enough and the initial setup is revealed, but the movie really takes off only after the twist at the start of the second act. Before that you're always wondering where the film is going and whether something is going to happen, but not in a good way. It keeps you waiting too long. It doesn't ruin the film, but it definitely tests your patience.Still, the second act more than makes up for it, leaving us with a great if perhaps a tad flawed film from Fincher. Not his best film by any means, but definitely worth a watch for all his fans.",Null,0,2,31 January 2017
Django Unchained," Pure Tarantino
","Quentin Tarantino is perhaps the only mainstream movie director that can give us a movie like this and still get away with it. If you can call him mainstream, that is. Perhaps commercially successful would be a better term. Or perhaps well-known. Regardless of the exact term, we don't usually see films this full of violence and gore outside of indie films. Which is a shame, because in my opinion this is an excellent film. Excellent.Though don't get me wrong. It's not a good film just because it has a lot of brutality, blood and extreme portrayals of violence. It's a good film because it has excellent characters, an interesting story and it is shot so well that you're transported right into the infamous antebellum era from the very first scene. It's a brutal film yes, but the era was equally brutal, and I give this film props for not shying away from that fact. Sure Mandingo fights might never have existed, but slavery was still a horrifying phenomenon, and this film deals with the subject admirably.The things I enjoyed the most are by far the characters. Tarantino has always had a talent for writing unusual and intriguing personalities and this film is no different. The dialogues are not quite as quotable as in his other films and there is not a clear winner for the best scene in this film, unlike in his previous ones, but the whole still holds together. The actors are equally as capable, though Christoph Waltz once again steals the show as Dr. King Schultz, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. Leonardo DiCaprio and Samuel L. Jackson are also very good in their roles. The only real nitpick I have is that perhaps the character of Django (Jamie Foxx) is a bit too bland compared to the rest of the outlandish characters, but then again he is the audience surrogate, so it kind of works. Perhaps he would have needed a bit more spice, but that's just my opinion.As for the story, I quite honestly feel that the ending dragged a bit too long. Or should I say that there was one ending too many. The film almost reaches a resolution, but then it suddenly throws in a twist that keeps it going for another twenty minutes. The twist has a purpose and it has been foreshadowed, but it still feels unneeded. But before that the film is pure gold. Especially the first hour or so, which is full of crazy scenes, intriguing character development and great atmosphere.Who would like this film? Well, if you're a fan of Tarantino, you're probably going to love this one. It's full of his unique style and visuals and the man is still going strong. If you're unfamiliar with Tarantino, you're going to like this if you're a fan of blazing action, interesting characters, westerns and/or great storytelling. However, if you're squeamish about blood, violence and gore, even by a little bit, stay as far away from this film as humanly possible. It's a film for adults, pure and simple. And for what it is, it's perhaps one of the best films I've ever seen.",Null,6,8,12 March 2013
Drive," Detached violence
","Drive feels like a crime action film directed by an art-house director. Its focus is not necessarily on the action or the coolness factory of it all, but on the human lives and their struggles to continue living. The storytelling is slow and ponderous, many long scenes are dedicated to subtle facial expressions alone and both the score and the visual design have that artsy feeling to them.As a whole it's an interesting experience and I'm in no way saying that its so called artsiness in any way takes away from its enjoyment value. Quite the opposite. Its a take on the genre I've never seen before and it has a lot of novelty value. Besides, the art-house style means that the aesthetics are given a lot of attention, which means that the whole film looks and sounds great. From fight choreographies to colours to dialogue, it all works.My only real problem with this film is really the main character, the eponymous Driver (Ryan Gosling). I can see the director's idea with the character. A coldblooded criminal, more in tune with the cars he drives than with people or life in general. It's an interesting character concept, but unfortunately Gosling plays him too subdued, at least for my tastes. It's hard to get into the head of someone that never expresses something or seems to care about anything. The main character is detached from the world of living and in the process from us, the viewers.Drive is an excellent film to watch if you want to see an intense crime action film that is shot extremely well with well-utilized production values. I cannot personally vouch for the main character, but I have heard that most people have no problem with him so it's just my personal pet peeve.",Null,0,0,10 May 2014
Aladdin," A laudable effort
","I'd say this is more like it. Aladdin is merely the latest in the recent long line of Disney live-action remakes. So far all of them have been disappointments. At least to yours truly. All so far have had at least a few redeeming qualities, but they have all paled in comparison to the originals. It's hard to turn animation to live-action, it seems. There's energy and vibrancy to animation, which Disney has always been a master of utilizing. And that energy doesn't translate very well when you need to be more realistic.Which is why I think it was exactly the right call to hand this film over to Guy Ritchie. The man has been directing live-action animation films his whole career, frankly speaking. If there's something that has never been missing in his films, it's energy.And I can safely say I like what he has done with his source material. This Aladdin pays homage to the original Disney animated film, but is confident enough to move past it, to extrapolate, to change things, to even improve. And while I still vastly prefer the original, I think this will be the first Disney live-action remake, which I will return to.So what works? Well, as I already said, the film is not afraid to mix things up a little bit. It's still mostly the same story, but it's not identical. Jasmine's role, for one, has been expanded by a whole lot, which I find to be a great thing. The original Jasmine was a feisty thing, but she didn't have that much to do in the film, aside from being the love interest. Sure, she distracted Jafar at that one point, but that's about it. This Jasmine has much more of her own voice, her own part to play. And I like it!Will Smith's Genie is also pretty different, a lot grumpier for one, which I also like. It would have been hard to beat Robin Williams, so I'm glad they didn't even try. Most of the extra run-time of this film compared to the original is spent with either Jasmine or Genie and they're all good, funny scenes.So what doesn't work? Well, Jafar for one. I like the small hints we get at his backstory, but aside from that he's a much more subdued version of the original. And it's such a disappointment. The original Jafar was a magnificent villain, one of Disney's best. I guess they were afraid to go too over the top, but that's unfortunately exactly what was needed here. Something more bombastic and menacing. This guy says his lines very placidly, very calmly, very methodically. And it's just not that scary.And while I applaud the film for trying for something similar yet different, there are moments in the film that are pretty much identical to the original film. They're also the moments I found myself caring the least about, because I had already seen them.The film also isn't quite as interesting visually as the animated version. It looks amazing, don't get me wrong, but the more realistic look means that they can't go as over the top crazy as they did in the original. And that loss is felt.Still, even though most of this review was spent comparing the film to its animated predecessor, I truly do feel that this is the first Disney live-action remake that can stand on its own two feet. It has the energy and creativity to awe its audience without the crutch of nostalgia. Kudos, Disney. You finally did it.",Null,3,5,11 September 2019
Bolt," Pixa- I mean Disney at its finest
","Lets face it, the early 00s were not kind on Disney. The Renaissance was over, their loyal target audience was in college and thus not interested, Pixar was doing the whole CGI thing way better than them and all in all they seemed to have lost their touch. Until this film. Oh sure, it's still very much like something Pixar would have done and a bit missing on that Disney magic, but it's still a very good film that allowed them to get back on their feet.And when I say it's something Pixar would have done, I mean that in a good way. Kind of. The plot features a dog, raised to believe he has genuine superpowers, suddenly being separated from his loyal owner Penny and now having to make his way back across USA to reunite with her. All the while having to learn that the world does not in fact play by his rules. Sounds like a Pixar movie, doesn't it. But then again, Pixar is a great film studio so that's not exactly an insult.And the story and the characters are very good in their own right. Bolt, the eponymous main character, is very gruff and no-nonsense, but also delightfully na√Øve about the realities of the world, while Mittens, his new cat sidekick/helper/kidnap victim is pretty much the exact opposite. And then there is Rhino, a hamster trapped in a plastic ball and also one of Bolt's biggest fans. Rhino is awesome.And yeah, it's kind of silly that I keep complaining about the fact that it's so much a Pixar film. It does make it seem a bit artificial in a way, because you know that they're copying much of their good material. But it's a good film, when all is said and done.

Frozen," Return to greatness
","Disney has never had quite such a streak of sheer quality as they had with their Renaissance, by which I mean their movies in the 90s, ranging from The Little Mermaid to Tarzan. All of them were at the very least above average, many of them to be counted among the very best, and quite honestly my Top Five Disney films consists of nothing but Renaissance films. They were all adaptations of beloved fairy tales and myths, all had gigantic Broadway style scores and focused on good, solid adventuring. Well, I say all. There was Rescuers Down Under, but that's something of a black sheep.Nevertheless, when people think about Disney films, they usually think about these films. Aladdin, The Lion King, Beauty and the Beast, Mulan. But then the team was broken, key people moved out of the studios and the magic of Disney, while by no means lost, never quite peaked like that. We still got plenty of Disney movies, but they were never phenomena like they used to be. Not until this film. People went nuts over this film, and for a good reason. It has it all. Phenomenal score, fantastic characters, gorgeous visuals and above all else, excellent, memorable story.There is a term called cultural keystone. For example, you only need to hum a few notes of Hakuna Matata to anyone who grew up during the 90s, and you can be assured that they can and probably will join you in singing it all along. Likewise, I believe, will be the case with Let it Go or Do You Wanna Build a Snowman. Children will obsess over this film because it is greater than the sum of its parts. It's storytelling on a deep, life-defining way. I learned a lot of my morals from The Lion King and Beauty and the Beast, and I honestly believe that the kids of the 00s and 10s will learn a lot of theirs from Frozen.And yes, yes, it's not a perfect film. The villain has a great reveal, but has a pretty weak performance overall. The trolls can be a bit aggravating and I'm not one hundred percent sure the CGI will age gracefully, though I would bet a modest amount of money on that it will. But the story, the music and the characters are so good in this case that they easily compensate for the few flaws the film has.What can you say, it's a born classic.",Null,4,11,11 July 2016
2012," Has its niche
","I don't really have anything against Roland Emmerich. The Independence Day is on my favourite guilty pleasures, and I sat through The Day After Tomorrow just fine. It's just that all of his catastrophe/Armageddon films are pretty much identical, with superficial skin and setting changes. Some kind of a disaster is about to destroy the Earth as we know it, and all of this is seen through the eyes of a normal family that at some point just happens to cross paths with the high and mighty politicians that are trying to save the humanity. The novelty has worn off at this point.Independence Day was also better in my opinion, because it was the most honest about the fact that this kind of a end-of-the-world scenario is highly unlikely and more than a bit silly in certain aspects. It got around that fact by adding in aliens and thus making it a scifi film. The Day After Tomorrow and 2012 on the other hand at least try to be somewhat scientifically accurate and believable, which does the films no favours. Also, Independence Day had more likable characters and actors. The president in 2012 is surprisingly about as good as the one in ID, but the main family is extremely unlikable. The dad is an irresponsible bum, the mother has very little personality, the stepfather is a smug redshirt and the son is an asshole. The only likable character is the daughter, with her adorable hat-obsession. The side characters aren't any better, though the Russians are at least sometimes funny.So why would anyone want to see this film? For the special effects, mostly. It's the kind of a film where the story gets sidelined more often than not in order for the big-budget action spectacles to take place. If the viewer is expecting that and is able to accept the limitations of the story, he might very well like this just fine. I was perhaps a bit bored most of the time, because none of the catastrophe scenes were anything I hadn't seen before, but I can't say that they were bad, either. Emmerich knows what he's doing with these films.I also have to admit that the final solution to the Mayan End of the World is kind of clever. The film lulls you into believing that the solution will be fairly clich√©d and traditional for these kinds of films, but then it manages to surprise you. Points for that.So, all in all this is a film that I wouldn't really recommend. If you've liked Emmerich's other catastrophe films and are looking for more, then sure, but otherwise I'd give this one a pass.",Null,1,2,7 January 2013
Peaceful Warrior," Boring and uninteresting
","Usually these kinds of 'realize your own potential, seize the day' films hold my attention, I find them interesting. The thing is, though, that usually these kinds of films try to spice up the message with a story that's perhaps a bit outlandish, but at the same time captivating. Dead Poets Society springs to mind. Unfortunately the story of this film is rather bland. It's your average sports story where the underdog overcomes physical impossibilities in order to prove to himself that he can do it. You've seen one of them, you've seen them all.To the movie's credit, the underdog story is not the main point of the film, though. Rather it's the relationship between this old mystical self-made guru (Nick Nolte) and his young student (Scott Mechlowicz) that needs to understand the realities of life before he can hope to overcome his obstacles. Unfortunately that relationship is where the movie fails to deliver, so to speak. Neither of the actors is bad, but neither do they have any real chemistry between themselves. The conversations they have are interesting to a point, but after the third time they'd gone over basically the same point and argument, I just couldn't care anymore. This is based on true events to a certain extent, so perhaps the real life underdog needed to hear these same arguments over and over, but I as a viewer could have used a bit of variety.I also couldn't understand some of these stunts that the guru pulled off in order to impress his student-to-be. The point that the movie was trying to make, if I understood correctly, was that if you focus on the present, you can overcome your limits, yada-yada. But when some of those stunts are frankly physically impossible, the viewer is left wondering whether or not the film is trying to step into the real of magical realism. I know I was so when I realized towards the middle of the film that these stunts were to be taken seriously, I actually laughed, because no way, no way under the moon and sun is that possible like that.All that being said, I don't think that this is a bad film. The acting is alright, the various gymnastic scenes are shot with great style and while the story felt a bit stale to me, I know that it's more because I like my self-improvement stories with a bit more flair than this. Would I recommend this to anyone? Probably not, but if these kinds of films are your thing, you should like it just fine.",Null,2,4,28 August 2012
The Lives of Others," Even spies have a soul
","A Stasi trainer, Captain Gerd Wiesler (Ulrich M√ºhe), is ordered to place a famous play writer Georg Dreyman (Sebastian Koch) and his girlfriend Christa-Maria Sieland (Martina Gedeck) under constant surveillance. The orders come from the highest echelons of the government, but Wiesler slowly begins to understand that the motives for them may not be as patriotic as they should. And at the same time the life of these two content souls begins to lure him in.Despite this film being just over a decade old, it feels much older. And in this case that works in the film's favour, giving it an authentic feel, like it could have happened right there and then. it gives the film weight, which is good, because Stasi and their human right violations are some of the darkest aspects of East German history. And yet, at the same time the film tries to shy away from black and white moralizing. Wiesler's character, despite being a high-ranking Stasi officer, is not a monster, does posses a soul and certainly has his sympathetic moments. This has apparently caused certain amount of controversy, some believing that Stasi and its legacy should be shown no mercy, no sympathy. Which seems uncomfortably harsh to me.Then again, I was only a few months old when the Berlin Wall came down. For me, this is history, something that happened in the distant past. It's funny for me to think that the events of this film took place when my parents were teenagers or young adults. The world has certainly changed since then.For me this film is more interesting than it is good. Certainly it's acted well and directing is superb, but it still seems more like a gateway into a subject, a conversation starter, rather than a great movie in its own right.",Null,1,1,5 May 2018
Hellboy," Colourful yet grim fantasy tale
","Here's a fantasy film, a comic book adaptation actually, that isn't afraid to fully commit to its world. The world of Hellboy is a strange, multilayered and bizarre combination of influences from Christian mythology to Russian history to weird pulp science fiction. Yet under Guillermo del Toro's direction it all takes shapes and starts to make sense. The world is never explained in detail, like in some other superhero films. We never get to know where most of the weirdness comes from or what it really means in the grand scheme of things, but it all feels like it has a purpose. It feels real within the realm of the film.So what's the story. There lives a demon, the eponymous Hellboy (Ron Perlman), who was brought to Earth during World War Two by Rasputin (Karel Roden), who was working for Hitler at the time - but of course he was - but who was taken in and raised by an American professor Trevor Broom (John Hurt) when his group of Alliance soldiers helped to stop Rasputin. But now Hellboy must face his original enemy and learn who he really is. It is an outlandish tale and the film is brave enough to not beat around the bush with it. It doesn't try to modernize the character, it doesn't try to make it more sleek and current. It's good, old-fashioned geeky story and damn proud of it.The reason why I didn't rate the film any higher is that I think the central story would have been fine as it it. It would have been strong enough to work as a pure adventure film. Unfortunately the plot is diluted by needless side characters and their story arcs and the connections to Hellboy's own arc. Take for instance John Myers (Rupert Evans), who gets transferred to Hellboy's unit from FBI. He's the audience surrogate, there to allow other characters to explain things to him. Yet the thing is that the film doesn't really need an audience surrogate. It's a complex world, but as I said earlier, del Toro's directing is strong enough to explain the world through other means. Surprisingly little is explained through Myers, making him absolutely pointless. Then there's the director of the unit, the various agents, other 'freaks' of the unit, various bad guys and so on. I get that most of them are from the original comic books. It makes sense that they wanted to include them in the film. It just pains me, because there's such a good adventure plot, which gets buried beneath all the establishing scenes when the film tries to cram in yet another character. Plus there's a romance subplot, because of course there is...If I'm being completely honest with myself, I have to admit that my dislike for this film is more than little irrational. Objectively looking it's a fine film. The main leads are very strong in their roles, the film looks great even today and the mythos is especially intriguing. I just can't reconcile with myself about what I want this film to be and what it actually is. If you're a fan of gritty adventures, comic book movies or full and detailed fantasy worlds, then I'd give this one a watch.",Null,0,0,5 March 2014
P.S. I Love You," Sweet, sad and heartwarming
","One of the better romantic dramas that I've seen. P.S. I Love You has a storyline that's at the same time just outlandish and exotic enough that it keeps you invested and excited, yet it's still just within the realm of possibility so that you can reflect on how you would react in a situation like the one in the film. Plus it's a rather sweet and touching story about love, loss and sometimes being unable to move on.The thing that impressed me to most, though, was the fact that the film actually acknowledged that we usually view our lost loved ones through rose-tinted glasses. Because we actually see Gerry (Gerard Butler) and Holly (Hilary Swank) arguing before he passes away. And yet the rest of the film spends most of its time depicting Gerry as a saint. Thus it'd be so easy to call his character unrealistic and naive, if not for that arguing that turns the whole thing upside down, because in most cases it's Holly that's doing the depicting. And more often than not, we do like to remember our lost loves with fondness. So the movie nails that aspect of grieving rather perfectly. Though Gerry is still a rather amazing guy. I'd say a bit too amazing, but it's a romantic drama. It's wish-fulfillment.So the story works. Add in good characters, some interesting locations, Ireland and a rather colourful visual style and you have film that's a very nice way to spend a few hours. It's not going to challenge your view of the world or anything that extravagant, but it'll make you feel better, I guarantee. It's heart-rendering, sweet, lovable, sad and uplifting, all at the same time and it certainly has scenes that will stick with you. Especially the first meeting between Holly and Gerry. I loved that scene. And you should check it out as well.",Null,2,2,21 September 2012
Good Will Hunting," Arrogant genius learns facts about life
","The story of this movie begins with Matt Damon still in Harvard. He wrote the initial script for this movie as a class assignment. Later on he would recruit Ben Affleck to finish the script with him. And thus one of the most well-known films ever made was born.And for such a humble beginning, the movie is much better than it has any right to be.The story tells about Will Hunting (Damon), who's a mathematical savant and an all-around genius. Unfortunately he comes from the wrong side of the tracks in Boston and has thus ended up working as a janitor in MIT's math department. Until one day he's caught scribbling on the hallway blackboard. Scribbling such math that even the professors have a hard time keeping up.The film isn't very heavy plot-wise. Rather it's the characters, these huge personalities played by talented actors, that make the film such a memorable classic. In Hunting you can definitely see clear signs that he was written by a schoolboy, but his problems are treated in a mature way and given enough depth that you care. The movie has some good thoughts about being gifted and the meaning your starting point in life has on your choices.Plus the film has Robin Williams in it. This is not in fact one of his better roles, at least in my opinion, but the man was such a talent that even three fourths of his maximum effort was more than most could conjure up combined.This film is best seen as a teenager. As an adult you can be a bit annoyed by Hunting's clear Gary Stu tendencies and the wish fulfillment talents, but even then it is more than a watchable experience and a neat piece of film making.",Null,0,0,28 January 2018
Room," Horror story in the form of a drama
","Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay play Ma and Jack, a young woman and her son. Ma has been locked up in a tiny room for seven years, Jack his entire life, for he was born there. But as Jack turns five and his curiosity starts to grow, Ma decides to attempt yet another escape.The first half of this film is chilling. To live in such a closeted space, with only the barest of necessities. Never feeling the wind on your face, barely even seeing the sun. With only one other person for company. Their kidnapper should not be counted. And what makes it even more chilling is the fact that it's told from Jack's point of view, who of course treats it as completely natural. He quite literally doesn't know anything else.Powerful premise, given even more strength by the performances of Larson and Tremblay. Larson quite deservedly collected an Academy Award for this role, but I have to praise Tremblay as well. He sells his character beautifully, even though Jack's upbringing is about as far from normal as is possible. But in Tremblay's hands Jack's humanity shines through.If I had to name a flaw, I really shouldn't, but if you were to force my hand, I'd say that the second half of the film lost something. It was still chilling, but more as a mundane drama. It ceased to be otherworldly and barely conceivable, becoming a story of mother and son trying to live. Which is still good cinema, but not quite as intriguing.Nevertheless, one of the best dramas I've seen in recent years and well worth its praise.",Null,1,2,5 January 2020
The Secret Life of Walter Mitty," Looks great, lacks substance
","The Secret Life of Walter Mitty is the next in a long line of movies given to big name actors and/or producers, where the production values and all the technical aspects are great because they have enough pull and capital to hire the best people, but where not enough thought is given to the story to make it the best one possible.The film starts out slow and abysmal. Walter Mitty (Ben Stiller) is a complete harebrained idiot with the attention span of a sleepy squirrel and the tendency to wander off into his own little fantasy worlds. You can see that the film makers were going for the sympathetic everyday awkward guy, but the end result is so out of the norm, so shared sense of shame inducing and so bizarrely out of it that you cannot really get behind him. Sure you feel bad when he's picked on, but he's such a weird guy that you sort of get the sense that the pickers don't do it out of malice, rather they're just as baffled by him as you are.It gets better, fortunately. As soon as Mitty sets out on his journey the film gets much more interesting, his character loses much of the unbearable spaciness and the film's budget really starts to show. You'll get the world-scoping adventure you've seen in the trailers, you just have to wait for it. And it's not a bad adventure. Multiple locations, all breathtakingly beautiful, some good character moments, good conversation, some action, close situations, even closer calls and as a whole it's a lot of fun.I think this film's biggest problem is that it was marketed as the next Forrest Gump. It's not. It doesn't even try to be. It has some of the same themes, and I suppose the main characters can be labeled similarly if one is so inclined, but it is its own creation. If you're going in expecting to see a warmhearted social commentary/adventure comedy featuring a simple soul in the main role, you're going to be disappointed. It is a warmhearted adventure comedy, but that's where the similarities end.This film has its problems. The beginning is not very good, the characters get better towards the end, but they start out pretty boring and even the timeline is too tight for the plot to make much sense given that the main idea of this film is for the main character to travel and see the world. But it has some gorgeous imagery, it DOES get better towards the end and it has a good message. It evens out to an average score.",Null,1,1,8 July 2014
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Magnificent second part
","The Fellowship has been broken, Frodo and Sam travel towards Mordor alone, Merry and Pippin have been taken by orcs, Gandalf and Boromir have fallen and Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli must make haste to save at least some of their comrades. And at the same time the threat of Mordor grows as war comes to Rohan, the land of the horselords.It is an epic in the every meaning of the word, and possibly one of the best second parts of a trilogy in the history of cinema. Sure, all three of the movies were shot back to back, but the fact still remains that middle parts of any kind of story are often the hardest. You have already established the setting, introduced the main characters, yet you still have to hold back until the end finale.The Two Towers solves this by giving us one amazing opening battle in the War of the Rings. The Battle of Helm's Deep, still considered to be one of the greatest battles put on film, and for a good reason. It is cinema at its finest. The huge scale of it, the special effects, the practical effects, the pacing, the score, the fury and the stages.But we also have other good stuff to tide us until the end of the film. The movie jumps around quite a bit, juggling various plot lines, and they all work very well. And, most importantly, this movie introduces some great new characters. Bernard Hill plays the role of Theoden, King of Rohan, and he is a very fitting counterpoint to Aragorn. He's an aged monarch, a warrior past his prime, and thus frailer, but also possessing pride in his status as a ruler. Very good performance, one of my personal favourites. But it's Gollum (Andy Serkis) that everyone always mention, and for a good reason. In many ways he's the most important character in the whole story. He's the tragedy under all the heroics, noble sacrifices and great deeds. He's the dark shadow, the weakness of mortals made flesh. Without him Frodo's struggles wouldn't mean half as much. And Serkis plays him perfectly. He's a marvel of special effects and man's ability to slip into a role. Especially considering that he's essentially two characters molded into one.The Two Towers is a great film on all levels. It transitions us from the origin stories of The Fellowship towards the grand battles of the Return of the King, all the while keeping the story flowing smoothly and keeping us firmly in the mood for Middle-Earth. Masterfully done, Mr. Jackson.",Null,2,3,14 September 2015
The Lion King," Garbage
","I did not want to see this movie. I did not want the Mouse to think that I in any way support this new trend of simply remaking old Disney classics with wooden actors and sparkling CGI. But alas, I was dragged into the movie theatre anyway, and here I am, telling you that I'm deeply ashamed that the Great Black Mouse of Disney has my money. Yet again.Because I was right in not wanting to see this film. Because this is the bottom of the barrel. The other movies have kind of been shot for shot remakes, but every single one of them has had at least something new. Some other angle, some twist, to make it interesting. This, one the other hand? Holy cow in heaven, is this bad. The beginning, for example. You know, The Circle of Life, one of the most recognizable and striking movie openings in history. The exact same. Shot for shot, camera angle for camera angle, the exact same. Except, you know, not as colourful, iconic or fetching. Because it's supposed to look real. Which in this case apparently means that everything looks either more wrinkled, dusty and/or dirty in general. Because that's Serengeti for you. According to the film makers.Luckily they stopped with the exact shot for shot soon after that, thank heavens, but that was only a minor relief. Because you know what else happens, when you try to make everything look as real as possible? Aside from everything looking like it's going to give you fleas. It makes everything look emotionless! Lions are not exceptionally renowned for their wide range of facial expressions, you know. The reason you can make animated movies with animals as the main characters is because animation doesn't care that lions can't have facial expressions. You can go outside the realms of biology and what's strictly speaking possible. You can exaggerate, emote and play loose with the rules. You can use colours, shapes and perspectives to compensate, to make it look interesting. This film has none of that! It's a dull, emotionless, flat table reading of dialogues we all know and love, but which are given nothing to support them.Not helping the matter is the fact that they hired celebrity voice actors. These people are talented entertainers, yes, and they look fetching on a poster, but none of them is exactly renowned for their voice acting capabilities. And boy does that show! Even James Earl Jones sounds like he's about to keel over and pass beyond the veil at any moment. There's very little of the majesty and gravitas of the original Mufasa left in his performance.And I actually misspoke earlier. This thing has one new thing in it. A song. A song by Beyonce, named Spirit. Because apparently that was the price of getting her on board. Or perhaps Disney wants an Original Song Oscar nomination. I don't know, but the song is awful and feels exactly like what it is. A forced, jammed in last-minute addition.Saints in heaven, was this a bad movie. It's a bit over a week after I saw it, but writing this review actively ruined my morning. I feel awful even thinking about this. About the fact that Disney has made incredible amounts of money with this. That they're going to keep making these.And I contributed to it. I think I might be sick. Excuse me.",Null,226,328,9 August 2019
The Incredibles," Enjoyable mix of superhero and spy tropes
","With this film Brad Bird brings something interesting into the superhero craze. He takes the normal superhero norm (secret identities, superpowers, supervillain etc.), and combines it with the spy aesthetic of the early James Bond films. And why not? The stories, the covert operations, the code names and all that feel very much at home in both genres and they mix together almost seamlessly.Bird's approach is also interesting in that he focuses rather heavily on family dynamics. And just how similar and familiar they feel despite the whole family having superpowers. Quite honestly it makes them more human than any X-Men film has ever managed. Not because their struggles are so similar, so humane in nature. But because they are human, plain and simple.Not that the film doesn't work in any other way. Far from it. It's a beautifully - really beautifully, in fact - animated adventure film with great characters, great villains, great locations and all that jazz. I especially love the use of colour in the film. Every single frame makes me love the 60s aesthetic even more.If I had to nitpick, I perhaps could say that the villain is perhaps a bit too goofy. He manages to be menacing when he needs to, which is not something every goofy villain can say, but there still a couple of scenes where his performance doesn't quite flow. At least for me.Still, one of the better Pixar films to date and certainly one of the more unique superhero films our there. Certainly worth a watch.",Null,0,0,3 October 2018
The Elephant Man," Beautiful and thought-provoking film
","David Lynch has a talent of holding up a mirror. The audience is allowed or even forced to confront its own flaws, its numerous shortcomings. Yet the undertone is more often than not the one of hope, that we still have the chance to learn. Some could even claim that in some respect this film is educational. It certainly has a moral lesson. That pity rarely is the right answer, as it is nothing more than the grudging nod of a supposedly superior being towards a lesser man. Rather we should learn to respect and accepts others as equals, worthy of our time and their own individuality. It is a difficult lesson to teach without preaching or pointing fingers, but I rather think that this film accomplishes just that and it accomplishes it with beauty and grace.The brilliance of using a character like John Merrick, played by John Hurt, is that he's such a shocking figure. And the movie plays with our expectations and our ingrained need to gawk and whisper. Our glimpses of Merrick are controlled and shrouded for a long time and when we finally see him it's such a sterile experience that we're forced to ask ourselves what all the fuss was about. And right after that Merrick starts to grow as a character and I honestly felt rather awful later on when I realized that I had immediately dismissed this man and his nature just because I had been so interested in how they had managed to make him look. It's a skillful trap and one that many will fall into, which helps to teach you the lesson.Though speaking of Merrick's appearance, I must commend the makeup department, as he really looks hideous. There's an immediate reaction of repulsion when you first lay eyes on him, even though the shot itself is such a sterile one. And that repulsion is of course the fact why the need to respect this man needs even to be taught. You absolutely wouldn't expect such a kind soul from a body like that, but as always, you cannot judge book by its covers. In this case ugliness only goes skin deep and in time I learned to greatly respect and even admire Merrick's character and his willingness to endure.A film with just Merrick in it would hardly be adequate, however. Thus I am glad that they managed to get someone like Anthony Hopkins to play the part of Frederick Treves as he is an important audience-surrogate. We feel and process our emotions provoked by this film by watching and learning from his reactions. The initial sick wonderment, the horror of realization, the misguided pity, the shame, the willingness to know better and the eventual respect. It is a staggering amount of emotions and subtle nuances to express, but Hopkins manages it with ease and aside from Merrick, his role is easily the most captivating in the entire film.I would however slightly criticize just how saint-like Merrick has been made in this film. In some ways it works for the film's favour as the lesson gets taught much better when the contrast is as clear as possible without being naive. But the real-life John Merrick - yes, this is based on real people and events - was by all accounts a man, he had his flaws. Not numerous, but flaws nonetheless. Merrick's only real flaw in this film would seem to be his inability to stand up for himself, which makes him more rounded and more identifiable - plus it helps with the pity - but it's still a minor issue, at least for me. Treves is also given a much nicer role to play in Merrick's life, while his initial 'handler' is greatly vilified, but I can recognize that the film works much better this way rather than if the real-life events had been perfectly replicated.On the technical side of things, this is a remarkably well-made film. The shots and settings have themes and ideas behind them, they're not just random shots of hospitals and the streets of London. The black and white aesthetic also works really well with the Victorian setting, plus I bet that it helps to disguise the rubbery texture of Merrick's face. The music and the pacing also work rather well, but it's the visual side where this film really shines, aside from the story of course.I admire this film. It doesn't feel like it's trying to force you to some conclusion or another. In retrospect you can of course see that you were guided, but it felt natural and I was allowed to draw my own conclusion. I had to gaze into my own person, my own soul, and allowed to decide whether or not I liked what I saw or not. And that's the strength of this film. It wants you to better yourselves, to show you that you still have some ways to go and that the society of today is not without any flaws. It's a beautiful film.",Null,1,3,16 December 2012
A Quiet Place," A horror film on the surface, a film about families beneath
","In the world of A Quiet Place, there are monsters who hunt solely by sound. We follow the initial survivors after the appearance of these monsters as they learn to deal with the situation and to live as quietly as they can. Because any loud sound has a high chance of bringing the monsters straight to your doorsteps.Fantastic premise, easily A tier. You could tell entire sagas about humanity forced into silence. I also really like that we don't see the first days of horror. The movies happens some months and years after that. The initial slaughter is over and those who are left live in a constant state of anxiety. The film is eerily quiet, with not much of a score or any sound beyond soft footsteps, some creaks and groans, and the occasional whisper. Any sound louder than that is stressful, both to the characters and the audience. You can imagine it's easy to tell a horror story with such tools in your arsenal. And the movie definitely delivers.But the film is more than that. It's a story about a family living under stress and still trying to have more than the basics of survival. They argue, they doubt, they love and cherish. The parents are played by the director John Krasinski and his real-world wife Emily Blunt. And these two definitely have chemistry together, which brings the film a great deal of authenticity.Furthermore, one their children in the film is congenitally deaf - explaining the plot point of the family knowing sign language - and Krasinski sought to find an actress who's deaf in real life. He found her in Millicent Simmonds, who's simply all kinds of fantastic in her role. Not just in portraying deafness, but all-around.Very good film, and one of the best horror films I've seen in years. Very highly recommended.",Null,1,3,15 October 2019
Dog Day Afternoon," Two idiots rob a bank
","Based on a true crime and a notable media circus, Dog Day Afternoon retells the tale of John Wojtowicz (Al Pacino) and Salvatore Naturale (John Cazale), two Vietnam War vets, who have been beaten down by life and one day have a bright idea: 'Hey, banks have money, right?'The movie takes us through the events in a slow, deliberate manner. Almost no music is used, the set is almost just the bank and the street outside, the actors were given a lot of freedom to improvise their lines - especially the heated parts - and all in all the film tries to really take you there.And it works. Especially because Pacino and Cazale are two such memorable, identifiable actors. Their characters are two simple idiots, who really didn't have a plan beyond walking in with guns. But that's what makes this movie stand out. These two feel like real people, with their odd idiosyncrasies and short-fused tempers. They're certainly not the criminal masterminds you usually see in heist movies.That being said, the film can feel a bit slow, but then again, that's sort of the point. Once they end up taking hostages, it becomes a waiting game, and that's reflected in how the story is told. Could the narrative be a bit tighter? Maybe, but then again, just as I was about to become genuinely bored, the film picked up the pace and threw in some now plot developments. So it's a measured amount of slowness. Can't really argue against it.Dog Day Afternoon is a great watch if you're a Pacino fan or you're looking for a film where it feels like you could round a corner and walk straight into it.",Null,1,2,19 March 2018
Cars 2," Very odd film
","So apparently the original Cars was not exactly a critical success, but it was a real hit with the audiences, making mucho mucho moneez, as they say. So, a sequel was pretty much inevitable. Yay...Interestingly enough the sequel chooses to focus much more on Mater (Larry the Cable Guy). You know, Lightning McQueen's rusty tow truck sidekick from that little town in the first movie. Yeah, he's the main character in this. He teams up with a pair of British spy cars who are tracking an international terrorist group looking to discredit a new bio-fuel initiative.Yes, really.And I have to admit, I was not expecting that. None of us were. And in its bat guano insanity, I managed to find something. Is it a good film? Not really. There world still makes no sense, the Lightning McQueen side plot is perhaps needed, but ends up feeling rather pointless, and the humour is still only so-and-so. But I have to admit that when you have British James Bond cars zooming across the skies with jet engines and pulling mounted miniguns out of their fenders, you suddenly become much more accepting of the little oddities this world has. Like the fact that these cars need fuel to function, but they still eat human food. For some reason. Isn't fuel their food?And that's really the movie in a nutshell. It's Pixar's nice little break from the heavier stuff. It doesn't mean much, but you can have fun with it, and it's very much the definition of harmless. Personally I liked it even a bit better than the original, but then again that's not a high bar to cross.",Null,0,0,6 October 2019
Amadeus," Brilliance born out of stupidity
","Amadeus is the fictionalized biography of one Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, the most famous classical composer to ever walk the Earth. It tells the story from the point of Antonio Salieri, a contemporary composer, whose name has been largely lost to history except for those that study musical history.It's an all-around excellent period drama. The costumes and the visuals are top-notch, the score of course features some of the most recognizable pieces of classical music ever made and the production values in general are without any flaw. So it would be a pretty good film even if there was nothing else to it. But there is. This is one of my favourite character studies ever put to film. The character of Mozart, played by Tom Hulce, is a fascinating one. In this film he's portrayed as a musical savant. A buffoon of a man, endlessly consumed by the vices of drink, flesh and luxury, yet within him play the bells of heaven. The arias of God himself make themselves heard through this wreck of a man. And Salieri, a man who has dedicated his whole life to God as thanks for his musical ability, absolutely despises him because of this. Why Mozart? Why not him? What glory has this man achieved to be worthy of the kind of music he's capable of producing?And yet, despite all his flaws, despite all the contempt we heap upon him through Salieri, Mozart has redeeming qualities. His passion for music is unparalleled. His ability and sheer skill is without equals. He has flaws, vices, heavy leanings towards sin. And yet, though his music, the world is a brighter place because of him. And that has to count for something.Amadeus places the story before history. There are many facts which happened quite differently. Yet it is a masterful story. Enchanting, deeply personal, philosophical and, above all else, captivating, it will make you weep for these poor souls captured in the webs of their own mortal failings.",Null,2,4,16 November 2016
Kick-Ass," Clever superhero parody
","A film that teeters just at the edge of parody and satire. Its take on superheroes, both real-life and fictional, is both dark and twisted, empowering and admiring. Throughout the first act you feel like the film could have gone either way, either openly mocking the very idea of someone becoming an actual superhero, costume and all, or allowing some room for the coolness of the idea. In the end their selected route is the one that allows for some really satisfying action scenes and a lot of innate awesomeness, but some wicked part of me still wishes for more scenes like the opening one where a man tries out his wings for the first time. Perfect opening and mood setter for the whole ordeal.Nevertheless, what we end up getting is one of the better comedy films I've seen in a long time. Yet it still is a workable action film, but with a great sense of humour. The weirdness of the situation is never denied and there are many pauses where even the characters take a break and just look at one another wondering: 'Just what are we doing, man?' But, as stated, it's also a rather dark film, which is reflected in the storyline and some of the twists. Sometimes this dichotomy leads to some rather jarring mood whiplashes, but for the most part it works surprisingly well. The film makers have paced the film well. When it needs to be serious, you believe in its vision, and when it needs to be funny, you'll find yourself laughing, even while admiring the brutality of its action scenes.In the end I found myself liking this film. It's a strong movie character-wise, the action scenes are very effective and it's a genuinely funny film. The story lacks that razor sharpness that would have propelled this into an instant classic, but it's by no means bad. I mostly blame the indecisiveness of the mood for this. Still, easily worth checking out if you like good action comedies.",Null,1,1,29 January 2014
Ghostbusters," Comedy legend
","One of the best comedy films in existence, and for several good reasons. Ghostbusters is one of those rare films that manages to stand head and shoulders above its peers for its originality, sharp wit, masterful storytelling and a cast of humorous oddballs.But what really sets this movie apart is the fact that it doesn't rely on pop culture references or inappropriate jokes, aimed to make the toddlers in the audience giggle. Rather it relies on sarcasm, visual creativity and the same brand of randomness that made the Monty Python group so successful. In essence, it's a timeless film, which humour stems from the human brilliance and not the lowest common denominator. It's a comedy film that even the most high brow film snobs can enjoy, as it doesn't treat its audience like idiots. There are several jokes that you can miss entirely and only get later when you have time to mull over the dialogue, which in my opinion is an extremely good thing.Furthermore, it's a very quotable film. The dialogue is at times razor sharp and some of the verbal gymnastics between the main characters still make me blink my eyes in surprise. The cast is also very talented, and no less could have been accepted for this script, but luckily they managed to get the big boys and girls to play these characters. The chemistry between Bill Murray and Sigourney Weaver is especially memorable.If I were to nitpick, I'd say that the special effects haven't aged all that well. Some of them are still surprisingly good, like the ghost trapping beams, which should not be crossed, but some, like the guardian 'dogs' of Zuul look really fake. It doesn't ruin the film, in some cases it even adds to the film's charm, but it's still an eyesore in certain scenes. And the ending has a certain amount of 'love it or hate it' quality to it. I lean more towards hate it, but only slightly.All in all this a classic. A comedy film that managed to create its own universe, its own cosmos and mythology. It did that with ambitious story, clever writing and a great cast of characters. It worked back then and it still does. Find it, see it, love it. Force other people to watch it.",Null,1,2,23 November 2012
Hero," Visual splendor mixed with intriguing storytelling
","Of the wuxia films that surfaced in the west after the success of Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, this one is definitely one of the best, if not the best one.Hero is a confident film. It opens where most movies would end, with the protagonist presenting himself to the emperor to receive his rewards. And from there the story is told almost solely through flashbacks, which would usually condemn this movie in its entirety, but somehow they make it work. A lot of that has to do with the storytelling device where the exact same story is told over and over again, but every time this happens, it's told slightly differently. This beautifully emphasizes the importance of viewpoint as well as existing prejudices and expectations when either telling a story or hearing one.And even then it would have gotten pretty boring, with the exact same actors going through exact same routines, but the cinematography is so well designed that the every time we return to a familiar scene, it feels different, and not just because it plays out with slight variations. The colour scheme is always drastically different, the layouts have changed a little bit (yet the settings are always identifiable) and even the score seems to underline the moods in new ways.It's a fascinating film to watch and it always keeps you guessing until the very end. It speaks of richness of its characters that at the final scene I had no idea what the protagonist was going to choose. Not because his character was too unpredictable, but because I understood his blight and the difficulty of the decision.If you have any love for wuxia films or Chinese culture, or if you'd like to see a story told in a way you've rarely seen, you owe it to yourself to watch this film.",Null,0,0,14 February 2014
The Hurt Locker," Over-hyped
","Best Picture of 2009, according to the Academy. It also won best director and best original screenplay out of the so called Big Five.I don't see it. I have no idea why this movie got so many awards, so many recommendations, so much critical praise. Is it a bad film? No, not at all. It's in fact rather good film, fully capturing the intensity of a bomb squad. I just wouldn't call it the best picture of the year, not even close.Still, it does some things very well. As stated, it is very intense from time to time. Every time one of the characters has to don on the bomb suit, the atmosphere picks up instantly. You can feel the claustrophobia, the detachment from the outside world, and I enjoyed those scenes very much. Most of the bomb situations are also creative and different enough to be interesting and I have to applaud the choice to film near actual war zone as it does add to the setting. It's a fine-looking film and the two sound-related Academy Awards were well-earned in my opinion.My biggest issues with this film lie with its characters. Director Kathryn Bigelow clearly tried to show us the detachment from reality that plagues these bomb squad members even outside their suits, but unfortunately I ended up being detached from them as well. I managed to form no connection with them, because none of them acted like a normal human being - at least in my opinion. They were there to illustrate a point, to act out the story and because they needed to be there, but they felt hollow and empty. At the end of the story I could say that I had enjoyed the scenery and some of the action scenes, but that I hadn't really learned anything new about war or its conditions.But perhaps that's just my failing as a viewer. Still, reviews are meant to illustrate the experiences of a particular viewer, and this one is mine. I don't particularly like this film. I can admire its vision and its professionalism, but it's not a film I would see twice or recommend to anyone.",Null,3,3,25 December 2013
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales," Tired retread of the same clich√©s
","I think I'm done with this franchise. If they ever end up making a sixth film, I'll probably end up not seeing it out of sheer principle. It is a great shame to see a great franchise go out with a whimper, but it happens more often than you'd care to think.So, once again we catch up with Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp), who's up to his old tricks. Once again there are couple younger actors playing foil to him, setting him up for hijinks and jokes. And once again there's a sea-themed threat to oppose both him and all sailors in general. This time the villain is played by CGI string puppet made to look like Javier Bardem. They will try to tell you that Bardem himself was involved, but this is obviously a lie.And I could get behind that. On Stranger Tides was not as good as the two previous films, and to talk about it and the original Pirates of the Caribbean in the same sentence is just sad, but it was good entertainment for what it was.But alas, this film is neither funny nor entertaining. Jack Sparrow is perhaps more absentminded than ever. At least in previous films he had moments of cunning and savviness. Here, simple drunken drawling, nothing more. Furthermore, the villain has no depth and no presence due to the obvious CGI gimmickry. The locations are not that interesting. The young couple are not that interesting. And it's just so... slap-sticky. Sure, the previous films had outlandish fight scenes and sets, but at least you could kind of suspense your disbelief. In this travesty that goes out the window in the first action set piece. They're not even trying.That being said, the film is more sad than it is outright awful. The music is still nice, there are a couple cool scenes and the world is still intriguing. I would not recommend this to any diehard Pirates fan, because it's such a letdown, but if you've merely liked the previous films, you might find something worth your while in this as well.",Null,1,1,3 December 2018
Moulin Rouge!," Music! Dance! Costumes! Melodrama!
","A young Scottish author (Ewan McGregor) moves to Paris right before the turn of the century to join the Bohemian movement. He's there to write about love, the only problem being that he's never been in love. Luckily, a group of actors recruit him as their new writer and he gets to meet Satine (Nicole Kidman), the Sparkling Diamond of the infamous Moulin Rouge cabaret. Unfortunately, the budding attraction between these two is bad for business as a very wealthy Duke (Richard Roxburgh) is also interested in Satine's, ahem, satins.What Moulin Rouge! does better than pretty much any other film I've ever seen is spectacle. Everything this movie does is gargantuan. Everyone is acting, emoting, always moving, but always in-character. These people are writers, can-can dancers, courtesans, low-life actors. It makes sense that their whole life is one humongous act where it makes perfect, logic sense for someone to burst into a song right out of nowhere. I especially love the scene where the Duke is about to discover the plot, but everyone, without even knowing one another, is able to pull the wool over his eyes with a quickly spun yarn conveyed through glances and fast-talking. That's how in tune with one another these people are.McGregor and Kidman are also very good in their roles and have some genuine chemistry. Sure it's drowned in cheese, it takes them about five minutes to fall in love and the romance is mainly there to be the romance. I don't really think they really get to know one another. But sometimes that can be forgiven if the movie can pull of the mood and the style correctly. And Moulin Rouge! definitely does.The production values are also amazing. The costumes, the music, the whole grandeur. It's also shot with a very distinctive style from the actual curtain opening start to the faded browns of Christian's sorrow to the lusciously vibrant colours of the cabaret. A film many people see solely for the visuals. They're that good.And yeah, it has its flaws. Its many, many, many flaws. The editing is way too fast, making you unable to focus on anything, especially in the beginning until you get used to it. Though, to the film's credit, it slows down a bit after a while. The story is kind of clich√©d and the ending twist is rather uncomfortable from the characters' point of view if you think about it too much. Roxburgh's Duke is also completely over the top, so much so that he would stand out in a children's morning cartoon. It's very much intentional and kind of fits in the whole mood of the film, but he's still something of an oddity among the character cast.But, Moulin Rouge! is one of those guilty pleasure movies where you really don't want to change any of the flaws (with the exception of editing speed in my case) because to change them would be to take something away from the experience. It's definitely not for anyone, but personally I appreciate it for what it is and will definitely pop it in everyone now and then for the rest of my life. Just because it is such a unique piece.",Null,0,0,22 January 2016
X-Men: Apocalypse," Overall mediocre superhero rumble
","What I do like about the X-Men universe Fox is building with this new trilogy and presumably the Wolverine and Deadpool universes, is that they're not too concerned with continuities and keeping everything absolutely straight and aligned. That's more Marvel's thing, and while it works very well for them, it wouldn't for Fox because they had to restart their whole story with First Class while still keeping people like Hugh Jackman with the franchise. Which led to Days of Future Past, which retconned a lot of the more obvious plot holes while providing an overall blanket explanation for all the differences that would follow.Which leads us to this film, where we once again meet Jean Grey, Scott Summers and all the rest we already know from the original trilogy. This time they're younger, not all of them are present and quite a lot of them have slightly different backstories and they interact with each other differently because of this. Yet there are a lot of nods towards the original trilogy, like it might still happen in this film's future... Kind of.So, yes, all neat and tidy in its own purposefully messy way. And the returning actors are still great, with James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender absolutely slaughtering their roles as Charles Xavier and Erik Lehnsherr, respectively. And some of the new actors are pretty good as well, with special mention going to Sophie Turner, most famous for playing Sansa Stark. Hopefully this movie is building towards her return as the Phoenix.But then the downside. And there's really only one really big one. The story is boring. We've seen this kind of 'the ultimate, all-powerful bad guy wants to tear down creation itself and make it anew in his own image' a million times before and it's really hard to do correctly. And this movie is no exception. Nothing against Oscar Isaac, he's a talented performer, but it's hard to take his make-up/costume seriously, even less so his dialogue, which is riddled with clich√©s and ominous whisperings about power, glory and destruction. And the story is pretty much the X-Men struggling to stop him, not much else. There are some really good character moments, especially with Fassbender's Magneto, but it's not enough to save the film.If you've liked the previous X-Men films, this is worth a watch. It's amongst my least favourites so far, but it still has the production values and acting pool to make it worth your while.",Null,0,1,25 October 2016
Meet Joe Black," You'll be begging for death at the end of this travesty
","In Meet Joe Black Brad Pitt plays Death who has decided, after eons of existing, to experience the human existence through an unhappy car crash victim. As his guide he chooses a filthy rich media mogul played by Anthony Hopkins. Because that's a fine sample of humanity right there. But, it just so happens that the mogul has a feisty daughter played by the lovely Claire Forlani. Hijinks do indeed ensue.This film has problems. The actors themselves are fine, yes. The technical aspects are fine, yes. Even the story is not half bad and would normally allow for an hour or two of lighthearted entertainment. Once again it's the execution that trumps all that.Because this film is ghastly boring, unimaginative, unbearable to watch and just an all-around mess. And almost all of that stems from the fact that it's Three! Hours! Long! At most it should be two, and even that would be tedious with the amount of story on display here. I mean, a firework is fun right? The shooting, the buildup of the climb and then the main thing, the explosion. Imagine all that taking ten minutes instead of seconds. That's how this movie felt to me. And why is it so long? Because apparently the director doesn't know the word 'cut', leading most scenes to go on a minute or two too long. Including fifteen minutes dedicated to peanut butter and a sex scene that has us staring at Brad Pitt's bulging eyes for another fifteen minutes. Oh I'm sure the scene lasted for a couple of minutes at best, but it sure felt like an eternity.It also doesn't help that the film is positively diabetic. Especially the ending, which tries so hard to be emotional and heartfelt that I feel sorry for it. Because it isn't. It's manipulative, forced and banal. I'm sorry, ending, that's the truth.Meet Joe Black has its fans and in some sick manner I can even see why. Its actors are capable, the story has that sugary quality to it that appeals to some and it is professionally made, aside from the length of it. Personally I died a little watching it. As in I'm three hours closer to death and I have nothing to show for it.",Null,6,10,2 July 2017
The Amazing Spider-Man 2," Strong sequel worth the original
","Marc Webb does it again, delivering an excellent sequel that continues the story line, doesn't dumb down the characters, maintains its strengths, and for the most part improves on its weaknesses. In essence a perfect sequel.Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone reprise their roles and the two are just as adorable and lovable together as they were in the first film. And it's surprising how well their chemistry can overcome even the worst clich√©s. In a weaker film their particular romantic subplot would be painful to watch and you'd know instantly how it'd end. Not so much here. Their character have enough depth and they're played well enough that you not only buy it but you'll also feel like it could go either way. And that's good storytelling.Furthermore, the special effects and all the technical aspects are just as good as they were before. The fight scenes are still a lot of fun and this time even the settings are more grandeur and imaginative. The way they have realized the so called 'spidey sense' is very cool to look at.Unfortunately the villains are still not that good. The more realistic tone and setting mean that their over-the-topness seems more silly than fun and they're not given as much room to shine as in the original trilogy. They're perhaps a bit improved from the previous film, but there's the new problem of there being too many of them. Hopefully the third installment can fix this one glaring weakness.All in all this is a great film. If you enjoyed the first film, this is definitely worth a watch, and even if you haven't, it's one of the best superhero films in recent years.",Null,3,10,7 June 2014
Ex Machina," Robot psychological thriller
","Ex Machina is an excellent example on how to do a science fiction movie with a smaller budget, now that CGI has evolved enough that it's easy to do convincing special effects without spending millions and millions.Caleb Smith (Domhnall Gleeson) is a programmer working for Bluebook, sort of a amalgamation of the futuristic reach of Google and the social media of Facebook, lead by a prodigal genius Nathan Bateman (Oscar Isaac), whose long-held dream is to be the first to develop a true artificial intelligence. But how to prove such a thing actually has sentience? At which point is it clear that the robot (Alicia Vikander) is actually thinking and not just utilizing a complex program of coded responses? That's where Caleb steps in and our story begins.What really sets Ex Machina apart from so many other science fiction movies is its style and genre. It's a psychological thriller, there's very little action and the focus is on the mystery, the mood and the atmosphere. This makes this a very refreshing movie to watch if you're looking for a change. Especially because the three main characters are all very interesting and played by talented actors.The reason why I didn't rate this film any higher is because I found the actual plot to be somewhat predictable. It was a good plot, but I was only surprised once, and even then not that much. Which is a problem, but not a deal breaker. At least for me. Plus I've watched a ton of science fiction in my lifetime, so I had something of a home advantage.What would have made Ex Machina a masterpiece is that it should have had a plot that truly did something different with the A.I. subgenre. Now it's merely a very good example of it and definitely worth checking out if you're looking for a film that's more about the morality of technology rather than the coolness of it.",Null,1,3,20 July 2015
Back to the Future Part III," Superior to the second one, in my opinion
","The final installment in the Back to the Future franchise once again picks up from where the previous film left us, with Marty (Michael J. Fox) trapped in the past and with a letter in his hand from Doc Brown (Christopher Lloyd), now living in the 19th century as a village blacksmith. And thus, it's once again the job of our heroes to get, you guessed it, back to the future.The first Back to the Future is undoubtedly the best in the franchise, there's no arguing about that. It is the most original, gets to do the best jokes, flows the smoothest and has the tightest narrative. But, many would claim that the second film is also the second best. A fair point, as it has some of the most memorable scenes and is arguably the most creative of the three. But, personally I do think that it jumped around a bit too much and that the third one is the better movie because it tells its story better, contains all the good sides shared by the two previous films and is a magnificent end to one of the best movie trilogies ever made.Plus I'm a sucker for good western comedy, which this movie has tons in it. That might have something to do with it.Once again all the actors reprise their roles and do it magnificently. Thomas F. Wilson shows a whole new side from himself as Mad Dog Tannen, a Wild West outlaw with a grudge to settle with Doc. The new characters, most notably Mary Steenburgen as Clara Clayton, also do a good job of being both sympathetic characters as well as hilarious parodies of the western stereotypes. Just like in the previous films.Definitely do check the film out if you haven't seen it already and liked the previous two films. It continues the story flawlessly and is an exciting end to our tale of Marty and Doc.",Null,2,3,10 November 2015
Nausica√§ of the Valley of the Wind," Haunting in its quality
","The second film directed by the acclaimed Hayao Miyazaki, the success of which allowed him to go and found Studio Ghibli. Based on a manga of his own making, it's a story about a world fallen into ruin and a secluded valley near the sea where the people are desperately trying to avoid the corruption and poison that have been left behind by their ancestors.It would take Miyazaki a long time to reach the depth and quality of this film. I'd say that it was Princess Mononoke that finally eclipsed this film in terms of sheer storytelling and world building. Every single detail in this film seems to be thought out and hiding deeper meanings. And the reason for that is because most of the details are given more room and depth in the manga, which I heavily recommend you read. Because if you liked this film, you're going to love the manga.I'd also claim that Miyazaki never managed to create a better main character than Nausica√§. She embodies all the great things about Miyazaki and Studio Ghibli. A warrior princess, who's also studied the Toxic Jungle more in depth than anyone before her. A compassionate leader, having taken over ruling when her father succumbed to the toxins of the world. A pure soul, but lacking the naivety that often accompanies such a characteristic. One of the finest examples of how a seemingly perfect character can still be made interesting and engaging to watch.As for the animation, Studio Ghibli would go on to make even better looking films, but this is still a beautiful film. Especially the Toxic Jungle scenes that are breathtaking in their majesty. The flying scenes are also very well made and convey the feeling of flight like only Miyazaki can.The honorary first Studio Ghibli film is also one of their best. One of my personal favourites.

Nausica√§ of the Valley of the Wind," Postapocalyptic environmental adventure
","One of Hayao Miyazaki's earliest film, based on his own manga series, and the film that allowed him to found Studio Ghibli. Often considered to be the honorary first Ghibli film, and definitely an important film for Japanese animation in general. It's also a tremendously fantastic story in general.The film takes place after the fall of civilization. Something called the Seven Days of Fire has ravaged the Earth, leaving desolate wastelands and deserts behind, but also something more sinister and threatening. A humongous mass of spores, rot and corruption called the Toxic Jungle is slowly engulfing the Earth and there's nothing humanity can do to stop it. The jungle is completely inhospitable to humans, but it breeds life of its own, most notably giant guardian bug creatures called the Ohm. But why did the jungle came into being, what is its purpose and how can Nausica√§, a warrior princess of a small seaside valley, save her people while two opposing nations threaten to unleash war upon her lands?Nausica√§ is one of the first films directed by Hayao Miyazaki, but even then he had already found his voice and the film is filled with his trademarks. Fantastic flying scenes, strong female characters, gorgeous animation and designs, haunting music by Joe Hisaishi, and one of the most nuanced and subtlest environmental messages ever seen on film. It took Miyazaki a long time to eclipse this film, and in my opinion only Princess Mononoke and Spirited Away do so without question.Nausica√§ of the Valley of the Wind is one of my favourite films of all time and definitely my favourite postapocalyptic film. It is a tale of heart, courage and acceptance, filled with unbelievable characters and breathtaking visuals. Go see it and then see the rest, if you haven't already.",Null,1,2,10 September 2015
Coco," Somehow Pixar keeps getting better
","Pixar has been focusing a lot on families in their recent films. And personally I like it a lot. Their earlier films were more about friendship, adventure, all that usual stuff. And it was great. But in their recent films they've found this voice, this message to carry. I honestly think that in Inside Out and Coco they have made their two best yet. And that's a high bar indeed.Coco tells about young Miguel, a shoemaker by legacy, but who carries a secret passion for music within. Unfortunately his family couldn't have a lower opinion about the beauty of tunes, song and strings. But then Miguel learns that his many times grandfather just might be the most legendary singer his nation has ever known.And when he accidentally gets transported to the Land of the Dead, what better chance to seek out this elusive relative of his.While the central message of Coco ends up being the importance of family, it's also a powerful movie about passion and what it means to seek it. And how these two huge things don't have to be contradictory. It also really works as a general story. The plot flows absolutely flawlessly. You can kind of guess the end twist, but at the same time it's told so beautifully, so naturally, that you have to appreciate the craftsmanship, if nothing else.Add one of the best scores in a Pixar film yet (fitting, really), stunningly beautiful colours and sets, identifiable characters, good humour and so much more, and you have a nigh perfect film for all ages in your hand. Coco is a masterpiece, no questions asked, and one of my personal favourite films from Pixar. From Disney-Pixar, for that matter.",Null,0,0,4 May 2018
Lincoln," Oscar-worthy performances all around
","Once again a fine proof of Steven Spielberg's love and respect for historical dramas, and of his ability to pull them off with dignity and grace. Lincoln, telling the tale of President Abraham Lincoln's attempts to dissolve slavery during the Civil War, is certainly admiring in tone, but not so much that it becomes ridiculous. It paints Lincoln as a man of higher morals, larger than life, but yet it acknowledges his humanity and the everyday side of his life. It shows us both his grandeur and insuperable ability to lead as well as his good humour and problems with his family.Large part of that is thanks to Daniel Day-Lewis, whose Oscar was certainly well-earned. The man disappears into his role and I have no problems imagining that the actual man himself might have been something like we see here on the silver screen. He especially excels in the scenes that show the joviality of Lincoln, showcasing a man that's above all else wise and beloved. At times his performance comes across as a touch absentminded, which I'm not convinced is intentional, but it doesn't detract from the whole all that much.The rest of the cast is equally talented, with special mention going to Tommy Lee Jones playing the part of Thaddeus Stevens. On the technical side of things the film has no flaws. Everything from costuming to cinematography works as intended, which is no surprise given the director, but the films is all about the characters and there I have absolutely no complaints.Lincoln is a good film, borderline great even. Its skill and talent will win you over and its message is one worth hearing. It's a shame it didn't win more Oscars, because it would have deserved them.",Null,3,4,12 February 2015
Donnie Brasco," Top echelon gangster movie
","Based on the true life of one Joe Pistone, played in this movie by Johnny Depp, an FBI agent who infiltrated two New York mafia families in the 70s, pioneering the whole concept of deep undercover work for modern law enforcement. It's also a genuinely good gangster film. It shares similarities with Goodfellas in depicting the lure of gangster life. FBI had long resisted placing agents undercover for prolonged periods of time because they feared they would become corrupted. And that's at the center in this film. Pistone, or Donnie Brasco, which is his assumed name, has to constantly struggle with maintaining his identity, his values, when every day he is surrounded by these men of wealth, power and charisma, all telling him that he's a great guy and that if he just sticks to his guns, one day he will be made.Also a beautifully acted film. One of Depp's best performances, no doubt, but the true star of the film has to be Al Pacino as Benjamin 'Lefty' Ruggiero, who becomes sort of a mentor figure for Pistone and also the one to pull him deeper under. Truly, this part couldn't be played by anyone else. When Pacino talks about gangster life, about gangster values, you buy it. You don't even hesitate. And that's what makes this film work.Donnie Brasco is not quite The Godfathers or Goodfellas - although it's the next best thing - but if you've ever wanted to see a gangster story told at least partially from the point of view of the police, this right here is your ticket.",Null,0,0,19 March 2018
Donnie Brasco," Goodfellas Jr.
","It's the 70s in New York and Donnie Brasco, a young jewels experts, gets pulled into the mafia by an ageing gangster named Lefty. Donnie is introduced to people, given responsibilities, allowed in the know about the rules of the crime family, all that jazz. But not everyone is as they seem and soon inner quarrelling threatens the integrity of the family.Watching this film feels slightly weird if you've seen Goodfellas, like I have. Because they're eerily similar in their portrayal of mafia. Like scene for scene similar. There's talk about made men, my friend versus our friend, all that stuff. They even exchange wads of cash for Christmas, just like in Goodfellas. I get that that is actually how the mafia just might work, but it's still weird how much stuff is pulled from that movie. Because the stories are not all that similar at all. Goodfellas is about mafia from the point of view of mafia, whereas this is about infiltration, examining the mafia from the point of view of an intruder.And it's a good movie all around. Johnny Depp and Al Pacino are both powerhouse actors, despite this being relatively early on in Depp's career. The story is interesting, the gangster world created is even more interesting and it just has style to it. Goodfellas perhaps portrayed the lure of mafia better, but this allows us to see the ugly underbelly of that.All in all worth a watch for all gangster movie fans. It has it all.",Null,0,0,3 January 2017
Big Hero 6," Very good origin story, boring villain
","Big Hero 6, based on one of those small time Marvel superhero teams no one has ever heard of, is Disney's first foray into moving some of its acquisitions into its animated movie canon. Marvel was a really big purchase on their part and it makes sense that they would want to utilize their newly acquired intellectual property in some capacity.And they chose a really small-time Asian themed group with almost zero fan base. Which was exactly the right choice. They still got to play with Marvel themes and styles without being tied to the expectations the fans had built with the success of Marvel Cinematic Universe. The movie was allowed to swim or sink based upon its own merits. And, I'm glad to announce that we have a swimmer.Big Hero 6 bets upon many of Disney's known strengths. To be specific, the visuals are fantastic, the family relationship between the two brothers is unbelievably strong, the characters are phenomenally creative and the whole story has a good feel of an adventure driving it. Hiro is a young child prodigy, who has gotten a bit cocky because ordinary life really offers no struggle for him. That is until his big brother Tadashi introduces him to his university, and for the first time Hiro is truly challenged to achieve something just beyond his considerable grasp. And then tragedy strikes.Though, to be fair, it's not a perfect film. The villain is pretty weak, first of all. You can easily guess who they're going to be and from there it feels pointless and pandering. Plus, while the team Hiro puts together, the whole Big Hero 6, is nice and all, I don't think that we really get to know any of them. They are a collection of quirks and nothing more. Hiro is fully fleshed-out, as is Baymax, his robot assistant, but none of the rest are.Still, it's a solid superhero film, visually gorgeous beyond belief and the first act is some of the strongest stuff Disney has ever done.

Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," In equal parts great and disappointing
","You either love or hate The Last Jedi. There seems to be very little middle ground with this film.Some people say it's a pioneer, blowing new ground for the saga and going to places never seen before. Those same people point out that The Empire Strikes Back did the exact same thing. Which it did. These people point out all the great scenes in The Last Jedi. Its iconic imagery, its grand vistas, its sheer weight in mythos. Rarely have we seen scenes this epic, this grandeur. That final confrontation between Luke and Kylo will go down in history. And they have a point.But there are those that hate its baffling side plots, its contrived writing. They hate what has been done to Luke Skywalker and how different his character seems from the original trilogy. They don't like how the film seems to have no idea what to do with Finn's character. Not that Poe fares much better, although he at least has a character arc in this. And these people have a point as well.As for myself, I'd say I fall on the side of the lovers. I simply can't get over those scenes that do work. Like whenever Luke and Rey are on the screen together. Or Rey and Kylo, for that matter. Or Kylo and Luke... You know, this film would work so much better if it was just those three.So yes, there are legitimate things to not like about this film, if you're so inclined. But, if you're a glass half full kind of person, there's also a lot of greatness to be found. Some of the best stuff yet seen in Star Wars.",Null,2,5,19 December 2019
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Very uneven in quality, but has some of the best moments yet seen in the franchise
","We have had the newest Star Wars films for a few weeks now and it has become abundantly clear that this is the great divider of the whole saga. Some people absolutely love it, some despise it unlike anything else - including Jar Jar.And when chips are down, it's actually pretty easy to see just why this is. It all comes down to a simple thing. Are you a glass half-full or half-empty kind of guy? Because this film has some of the worst things ever seen in Star Wars and it has some of the best.Personally I'm a half-full guy. The second half of this film is amazing. The battle on salt plains, with vibrant reds and whites, the rusty old speeders, the upgraded AT-ATs, the doorbuster, the final confrontation between Luke and Kylo. It borders on perfection. And then that final scene. You know the one. The little child in me, the one who flailed madly around in our garden with a stick for a lightsaber. That kid wants for the whole saga, the whole thing, to end right there. To stay in that perfect moment for the rest of eternity.Furthermore, there's the whole thing with Luke and Rey, with Mark Hamill absolutely killing it as a curmudgeon Luke Skywalker, the Jedi Master, while Daisy Ridley continues to impress as our new protagonist.Also, that cameo!But yeah, then there's the stuff we don't like. Such as the fact that the first half is not so hot. It has cool scenes, sure, and it feels like Star Wars, but the jokes don't quite land or there's just a few too many of them. Or that the plot doesn't have a clear direction. And then of course there's the subplot with Finn. Now, personally, I didn't mind the subplot while watching the film. But yeah, in hindsight it was more than a bit pointless.Nevertheless, I do honestly think that the second half makes up for it. There is enough raw quality that you can focus on that and still get enough to satisfy your urge for a great film. I mean, if we could deal with ewoks, we can deal with this.",Null,2,7,5 January 2018
Brave," Another fine movie by Pixar
","Pixar's thirteenth movie and the first one with a female protagonist. And naturally there have been loud and prolonged arguments about the pros and cons of this said character, Merida (Kelly Macdonald). Whether she is a much needed breath of fresh air, a female that can stand on her own feet, or whether she's just as clich√©d as the rest of the so-called strong independent woman wannabes and a whiny kid unable to accept responsibility to boot.I thought she worked marvelously. She is independent and very headstrong, but she doesn't fall to the usual clich√©s at all or if she does, she reinvents them and makes them feel unique to her. One of the great things about her is that she doesn't try to rebel against her gender, like so many lesser versions of her archetype. She is a tomboy, sure, but her rebellion is only against the role of her gender in her society. She doesn't wish to be a man in a man's world. She just wants to live her life as she wants, while still being a woman. A very small, but important difference and one that made her feel real.Furthermore, the characters overall are the real strength of this film, as is usual for Pixar. Not every one of them work as intended, though. I, for one, thought that Merida's younger brothers, the triplets, were an unnecessary distraction. They were the constant source of comic relief, and admittedly they made me chuckle a few times, but they were a tad overused. But fortunately the rest of the characters more than made up for them, being memorable, diverse, funny and identifiable. Special mention goes to Merida's dad, King Fergus (Billy Connolly), who's easily the most likable character in the movie and the source of best jokes.The film also looks great. The whole animation system of Pixar was rewritten for the first time in 25 years and it shows. The improvement is not mind-blowing, but it's noticeable. The small details, the smoothness of movement, the landscapes, they all look great and I couldn't have been happier. The score is also very decent and the voice acting is one of the strongest aspects of the film. How can you not love these Scottish accents. Unfortunately I had to see the film in 3D, and it didn't add anything. Complete waste of my money, that.On the downside, the story isn't all that great. It's not bad, really, but it doesn't reach that bar that Pixat has previously set for its films. The plot has some new and interesting things in it, and I liked how the invert some of the usual clich√©s completely, but then they proceed to play some of the worst ones completely straight, which just makes me seethe in disappointment. And it's not like a film cannot use clich√©s in order to be good, far from it, but it shouldn't be too predictable, and that's what this movie is. The moment a new plot point was introduced, I could tell how it'd play out. And I was correct most of the time. The ending had a nice twist, but that's about it.Story-wise this movie felt more like a Disney production, and not in a good way. It had song sequences, it had fairy tale elements, it had the children against parents kind of thing going on, it had a moral lesson to be learned... It just didn't feel like Pixar.That being said, it's still a good film. It's not great, like so many other Pixar films, but that doesn't prevent it from being very, very good. It has great humour, it has great characters, it has great animation, it's just the story that's a bit subpar.",Null,3,5,16 October 2012
Brave," It's fine, but also very by the numbers
","There have been quite a many Disney films in the 21st century that feel very much like Pixar films. It goes to follow that there would be a Pixar film that feels like a Disney film. This is that movie.Brave is the tale of Merida, a Scottish princess, who ironically tries to avoid that one fate for which many other Disney princesses have almost literally sold their souls: marriage. So she finds a wood witch and gets herself a cursed piece of of bakery, which she promptly offers to her mother, the main architect of the looming betrothal. But, once again our plucky heroine refused to read the fine print and the results of the spells are not quite what she was looking for. Are they ever?Brave is certainly a pretty film. Sure, some of the backgrounds and certain scenes show their age a little bit, but there are also scenes, especially in the forest, that still look very impressive. There's also Merida's hair, which is just silly in its complexity.Unfortunately I'm not a big fan of the story. It's very derivative of earlier Disney efforts, very predictable and doesn't stray far from the usual clich√©s and tropes. There's also the fact that it's not internally consistent. For example, there's a very good scene between Merida and her mother around the end of the second act. The only problem being that the curse should have been broken right there and then. It of course doesn't, because we still have the whole third act to go through, but it should have. And it does, at the end of the film, when we have almost the exact same scene all over again. Only this time it works, for plot reasons.Still, it's still a Pixar film. Meaning that even though it's not their best film by any means, it still has heaps of content, quality and charm. It'd not be my first pick if I wanted to watch a Pixar film, but if it's on TV, I'll watch it every time.",Null,0,0,22 October 2019
Guardians of the Galaxy," Popcorn to the stars
","For me this movie is a shining beacon of hope. Because the fact of the matter is that the new millennium has been a dark time in cinema. And I don't mean that the movies have been bad, they're actually pretty good. It's that they dark. They're brooding, melancholy, painted with black, blue and grey, full of themes like fallibility of man, loss, consequences, despair...So you can imagine what it must have felt like for me walking into this movie, sitting down and watching the first few minutes of this minutes as we set up the backstory of our hero. And it is dark. Like did I walk into a wrong film kind of dark. Where's the talking raccoon I was promised kind of dark. But then something magical happens. We see our hero, Peter Quill a.k.a. The Starlord, played by Chris Pratt, years later as he walks into some ruins. He rotates his shoulders, walks forward, the music start playing, and it's just... perfect. It's the movie telling you that it's here to have some fun, to make jokes, to play funky 70s music and to simply entertain you.And from there on out the movie is one of the finest examples of popcorn film there is. It's pure cheese, hearkening back to the 80s, where the heroes are cocky, invincible, always quick with a quip, where the sets were colourful, the action had a sense of grandeur and the main goal was to have an adventure.And yeah, the plot has some holes, the villain is kind of one-dimensional and the only female member of the team still has the least amount of character development and screen time. But those are minor problems for me, and for most of the people, I'd think, because the majority of the film is simply so entertaining.Guardians of the Galaxy might very well be the best Marvel movie yet made, aside from The Avengers that is.

Evil Dead," Effective remake
","Why make a remake of Evil Dead? Beside the point that such a thing has already been done - it's called Evil Dead 2 - the original movie is such a cult classic and so perfect in its own flawed way that I don't really see any way to improve upon it.And truth be told, the only area where this remake fares better than the original, is in the special effects department. Yet, unlike so many other needless remakes, this one comes amazingly close to the original in both atmosphere and quality. It feels like Evil Dead, or what it would have been like had the original been done today for the first time.What do I mean by that? It simply plays the tropes just as well and just as straight as the original. Sure, at times it feels a little bit like paint-by-numbers, and there isn't a lot of originality here, but it's still different enough, yet similar enough, that fans of the original can love its vision and passion for the source material.And as an standalone horror movie, it's heads above its peers, which doesn't say much nowadays, but there you have it. It's absolutely, delightfully gory, it doesn't shy away from the no-no's or taboos, the characters work in their satirically stereotypical way and as a whole you feel the chills.Though I must admit that the final fight/boss/horror/aberration was a bit of a disappointment after all the buildup.If you liked the original trilogy, I urge you to give this one a watch. It's not as good, but it's a close thing. It's Evil Dead for the new century.",Null,1,4,25 September 2014
The Imitation Game," Fantastic source material, so-so execution
","The Imitation Game is the story of Alan Turing (Benedict Cumberbatch), a 20th century mathematician, who is known as the father of theoretical computer sciences and the breaker of the Enigma machine during World War Two. He's also the inventor of the Turing Test, in which a machine is to be said intelligent if someone conversing with it cannot tell whether it's a man or a machine. Which makes him the father of artificial intelligence as well.What a fascinating man, and to the film's credit, the actual story cannot be watered down. The film focuses on Turing's career as a World War Two codebreaker and his invention of a machine capable of breaking the Enigma machine, which the Nazis used to hide all their important messages, making war intelligence rather lopsided in their favour. Now, to be fair, the film is rather famously historically inaccurate. Turing was nowhere as near autistic as Cumberbatch shows him, he didn't really quarrel with military leadership, he didn't confront any spies and while he was homosexual, it didn't define his life like this film is trying to claim. And that last part is a big problem in the film. Sexual equality is an important subject, certainly, but with Alan Turing there is so much more to talk about. I'd be much more interested in finding out more about his theories concerning artificial intelligence than I am watching him figuring out his feelings about male gender. But now the movie takes its sweet time raving about homophobia, effectively splitting the narrative in half, with neither side coming out feeling whole and fully realized.Still, the majority of the story is interesting. Not a perfect film, but a serviceable period drama no doubt.",Null,2,2,25 January 2018
Ip Man," Masterful martial arts performances
","A movie based on the life of Master Ip Man, who's most well-known as the popularizer of Wing Chun style of kung fu and as the teacher of Bruce Lee. The movie follows his life in the years leading up to World War Two and his exploits during that conflict. The movie is notably anti-factual, but in an honest way. Director Wilson Yip has outright stated that he put the needs of a good story before historical accuracy. When it's done this blatantly, I cannot find any fault in it.The movie mixes martial arts with historical drama, and I do have to admit that the former of these two aspects works much better than the latter. As a period piece the film works okay. The costumes and locations are interesting, the cinematography is at times beautiful and although the script is clearly from the point of view of the Chinese, the Japanese are not depicted as outright monsters, like they sometimes are.But if we're all being honest here, it's martial arts side of things, which really elevates this movie above its peers. Donnie Yen has a deserved reputation as one of the best in the business, and this right here is one of his finest films. Add in the fact that the film had a lot of great background help, including Ip Man's own son, Ip Chun, working as a consultant, and you have one fine martial arts fest in your hands. The fight scenes in this film are gorgeous. Highly choreographed, beautifully shot, just all around beautiful to witness. And they're all so different from one another. You never feel like you're watching the same match twice.Ip Man is a great watch for all fans of the martial arts genre.

Jurassic World," Still the second best Jurassic movie
","It took four movies, but finally the park is open, and actual paying customers are allowed in Jurassic Park, or Jurassic World as it is apparently now called. Yet despite all this success, unfortunately currents are brewing underneath and once again something will go wrong.And that's pretty much the biggest problem I have with this film. It's the exact same story we've seen three times already. Granted, it is the most logical story when you have dinosaurs bred for amusement parks. Something will go wrong, dinosaurs will run amuck, mass hysteria, yada, yada. But come one, there must be something else you can do with this setting. Shady executives selling dinosaurs for black market businessmen, dinosaur genes used to enhance modern day animals for blood sports, some dinosaurs appearing to be way more intelligent than science would have understand. Anything but this again.We even have the exact same kid characters in need of rescuing. Okay, their names and actors are different, but they're the Jurassic Park kid characters, no changes whatsoever. This is doubly annoying because this time the adult characters are actually pretty interesting and these two brats take away much needed time from them.That being said, the actual movie is okay. Sure the dinos are obviously CGI, but aside from that, they look impressive. Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard more than convince as the main adult characters. Irrfan Khan is a lot of fun as the eccentric new owner of the park and the rest of the cast is equally talented. Aside from the kids, that is. And while the main story is painfully similar to the ones before it, there are some new, refreshing touches. Like the fact that the park is actually open this time. The first third of the film flies by with no problems because of this. The ending climax is also very, very cool and almost worth the price of admission by itself.But, in the end, that means that Jurassic World is simply a slightly above average film in general. It's still the second best film in the franchise, but that's not saying much, seeing that parts two and three are not even worth mentioning in polite conversation.",Null,1,11,17 August 2015
Mission: Impossible II," About as decent as the first one
","The first Mission Impossible was a fun little action romp and one of the few films where I could stomach Tom Cruise as an action star. One of the few would also include this second installment in the franchise, where Ethan Hunt (Cruise) has to join forces with a professional thief Nyah Nordoff-Hall (Thandie Newton) in order to stop a deadly virus from falling into hands that would turn it into a weapon.I think I prefer the original over this one, mainly because it had a slightly rawer edge to it and had the novelty on its side. This movie feels just the slightest bit safer than the first one, and we don't really learn anything new about Ethan, though he remains as likable as in the first film.The sequel also maintains all the good elements. The excellent action scenes, the phenomenal special effects (at least for their time), the fun characters and the plot lines that are fun and silly, but not too much to distract you from the action.If you liked the first one, I urge you to give this one a watch.

A Bug's Life," Kurosawa would be proud?
","It's Seven Samurai... except with ants. Kinda sorta.Okay, allow me to explain. A Bug's Life, the second ever Pixar film, tells about a distant and isolated ant colony who have been harassed by a swarm of grasshoppers for time immemorial. Every summer they arrive, every summer they eat their food, every summer they promise to come back. Until one day, through an unfortunate accident, there is no food for the grasshoppers to eat, and they threaten to flatten to colony unless they can gather enough food for them. Unfortunately, there's not enough time left to do so. So an unlucky ant, named Flik, volunteers to go look for help. He finds warrior bugs. Or at least he thinks he does.That's a kid-friendly version of Akira Kurosawa's Seven Samurai. Or a kid-friendly version of The Magnificent Seven, if you're more familiar with the westernized version.Of course it's not quite as cut and dry as that, but you can definitely see the inspiration behind the whole thing. And it works. It's a classic story for a reason and this is a mighty fine retelling of that. The characters are likable, the action is enjoyable, the film looks colourful and there are good morals to be learned.Then again, the computer effects have not aged particularly well. The grasshoppers still look menacing and scary, but the ants look plasticky, the backgrounds belong in a low-budget video game and overall it has this feel of where the bar was lowest to it. It also suffers from the problem of having a character or two too many. Seven Samurai could get away with it. That movie is over three hours long. A Bug's Life is barely over an hour and a half.Still, I have fond memories of this film and it was still an enjoyable hour and a half even as an adult.

Prisoners," Chilling human horror
","Prisoners, directed by Denis Villeneuve, is not for the faint of heart. It starts in a peaceful suburbia, with two families coming together to celebrate Thanksgiving. But then a tragedy strikes, as the younger daughters of the families both disappear while playing outside. And from this setting we get one of the most cynical takes on human desperation I've seen in a long time.There are no perfect individuals in Prisoners, no easy answers or moral rightness. Most of the characters react to the stress of the situation in a very ugly manner, and you don't really side with any of them. But you're not supposed to. The purpose of this film is to show us that even normal, so called upstanding citizens are capable of horrifying actions under the right conditions. It's a story about desperation, human weakness, despair, stress and hopelessness. It's an excellent story, but it's not nice to watch. Set your expectations accordingly.It's also a very impressive movie on a technical level. Cinematography, the tone and the whole feel of darkness in the film are all topnotch. The actors are also phenomenal. Hugh Jackman gives one of his best performances in a while as the despairing, enraged father of one of the girls. Most of the tale is told from his perspective, and his blight is heartbreaking to witness. Jake Gyllenhaal is also very, very good in his role as an ace police detective, who for first time in his career might face a case he cannot solve. The supporting cast is also talented, though Terrence Howard, the father of the other girl, just doesn't have the sheer presence to stand next to Jackman as an equal. But he tries.Prisoners is a dark, distressing thriller that is not an easy journey to take, but is definitely worth it for those that can deal with its world view. Definitely not recommended if you're just looking to have fun and spend an evening, but if you're looking for something heavier and more meaningful, this is worth keeping in mind.",Null,0,1,18 June 2014
Logan," The beginning of the end times
","Hugh Jackman and Patrick Stewart return to their roles as Wolverine and Professor X, respectively, in this film that is almost certainly Jackman's last run as Wolverine and might just be Stewart's last as Professor X as well. And as far as swan songs go, they could not have asked for a better film.It's 2029 and mutants have become an endangered species. No new mutants have been born in years and only a few of the old guard are left. One of the few 'lucky' survivors is Logan, who is radically removed from his glory days, being reduced to a suffering husk of his former self. And he has gotten off lightly compared to Charles Xavier, trust me. But then a new mutant enters their lives. A young girl with a power set almost identical to that of Wolverine's.James Mangold is once again directing and he continues to show that he really gets the character. The Wolverine focused on Logan's past and the human behind the adamantium skeleton and the nigh immortality. Logan focuses on the mortality of the character. On the fact that all beings, even one such as Wolverine, must grow old. Must one day, no matter how far into the future, die.In that light I'm almost hesitant to call this movie a superhero film. Because it's such a reconstruction of the genre that it's almost a new thing in and on itself. It borrows heavily from westerns and the rougher side of Americana, while also being a bittersweet love letter to all the previous X-Men films and to all superhero films in general. While also being a brilliant film in its own right.Here's to you Hugh Jackman. Here's to you Patrick Stewart. And here's to you James Mangold. This will not be the last superhero film.

Avengers: Age of Ultron," Good second part
","The Avengers return together in the second installment of the Avengers film trilogy. Once again all the characters have to work together to overcome an enemy that threatens the whole word and once again we tie together all the individual plot lines from the solitary films.And once again it works. It really works. I especially like how director Joss Whedon has had the courage and common sense to allow the characters to evolve. The team has already been built so it's a great time to focus on their camaraderie. And that's the heart and soul of this movie. It's fantastic to see all these great characters working together and even just hanging around. In fact they have a party near the beginning of the movie and it's easily one of the best scenes in the whole film.The actors are still at the top of their game with Chris Evans and Robert Downey Jr. once again earning a special mention. They're the two personalities who define the franchise and I cannot wait for Captain America: Civil War for a chance to see them together once again. Furthermore, the special effects are still state of the art, the action scenes are exciting and the villain is also one of the best we've yet had, which is great because interesting villains have been the one thing that Phase Two movies have mostly lacked.But yeah, it's not a perfect movie or as good as the first Avengers. Most of the areas that work, work as well as in the previous film, but there are a couple of things that are a bit rough around the edges. Like the side plot they give to Black Widow and Hulk. It's interesting, but it comes straight out of nowhere and thus we don't really have a chance to connect with it. I'm not against the idea itself, but the execution needs some work. Secondly, by this point the plot formula is starting to become somewhat transparent. And I like the formula, but I would like it to be tweaked just a bit more so that I couldn't predict the story so accurately from the first few minutes.Ultimately what this means is that Avengers: Age of Ultron is a good film, but it doesn't come close to being the best we've yet seen. And truthfully, it was pretty unlikely that it was going to be. Second parts are hard to do because you still have to save something for the finale, yet you've already established the characters and all that. Nevertheless, Age of Ultron is more than worth a watch or two if you've like the franchise so far. Have no fear. It's good, great even.",Null,1,4,23 July 2015
Hotel Transylvania," Best Adam Sandler movie in years
","Adam Sandler more often than not leaves me absolutely cold. His sense of humour is too simplistic and lowbrow for me to enjoy it. That being said, this is a great movie. It's a simple concept. What if Dracula had established himself as a hotel owner to shield all the monsters in the world from those heinous humans with their pitchforks and torches. And what then, if one day a human found his way in. Nothing extraordinary, but the execution is so good here that it simply works.The characters are the main focus. Dracula (Sandler), his daughter Mavis (Selena Gomez) and Jonathan, the human (Andy Samberg) are the main actors and all do a good job in selling us both the humour as well as the drama. All are somewhat stereotypical, but in a good, humorous way and they work together extremely well. Especially Dracula and Jonathan.The rest of the characters are familiar monsters, ghouls and aberrations from various mythologies and stories. All are given enough of a twist to make them unique and their various quirks are fun to witness.The animation is also superb. Extremely fluid and smooth as well as fast-paced to the extreme. It also has a good distinctive style that suits the comedic tone. Not the best animated film I've ever seen, but it can easily stand next to anything Pixar or Dreamworks put out.As a whole Hotel Transylvania was a pleasant surprise.

","Tim Burton directs a remake of Forrest Gump. Just... let that sink in for a little while. Done? Okay, now that you're suitably afraid, let me assure you, it's not as bad as it could have been. It's actually rather good, truth be told. And yes, it's perhaps not fair to say that this is a remake of Forrest Gump as the stories are different, the characters are different and it's based on a different book. Still, it feels like a remake of Forrest Gump. Emphasis on feels. The whole 'a young man from a small town travels the world, meets important people and later in life profits from those contacts' is straight out of Forrest Gump. Heck, they're even both set in Alabama.This isn't a flaw, however. There's room for more stories like these and even though Forrest Gump is an obvious inspiration, either for the movie or the novel, it doesn't lessen the value of this film as it is different enough to be called its own creation. The most important differences are the shifted focus from international politics to family values and the vastly different main characters. Forrest Gump, at its heart, was a comedic drama with heavy leaning towards political satire. The whole Vietnam War and Gump's career as a soldier. Big Fish is smaller in scale in that its protagonist doesn't change the world, not even accidentally. The story focuses more on the idea of what it would be like to be related to a person like that. To someone who knows so many important people that sometimes it feels like he doesn't have enough time for his own family. Not for lack of trying, but because he lives in a bigger world. It's an intriguing idea and the film handles it with grace.The actors are also delightfully talented and the various characters are more colourful than in Forrest Gump. Burton's tastes shine through and the whole film has a nice feel of dark Gothic and urban mythology mixed with fairy tales. Colourful film all around. I also really like the central family. They all feel unique personalities and you can see the bonds between them. The relationship between the father (Albert Finney) and the mother (Jessica Lange) is especially heartwarming in a way I haven't seen in a while.If you're a fan of Tim Burton, Forrest Gump, urban fairy tales or good storytelling in general, this one is definitely worth checking out.",Null,0,0,19 February 2014
The Dark Knight," Both defines and transcends its genre
","As of this review, the most highly rated superhero film of all time, in fact the fourth highest rated film in general, the best Batman film that will probably ever be made and the one film that has a shot at breaking the superhero genre into the realm of art. The magnum opus of director Christopher Nolan. One my personal favourite films of all time.So yeah... in short, it's good, it's really good. One of those perfect films where the sheer quality of almost everything there is to be had in a film allow it to transcend its minor flaws into something groundbreaking. No film is truly perfect and without flaws, but for every moviegoer there are those few films that are so good that you don't really acknowledge any of the downsides. Those few films you use to judge all the rest. For me this is one of them.I also really like that I keep finding new good things in this film. Or rather things that I didn't notice as much. There are of course the obvious good things, like how good Heath Ledger is as the Joker, how good all the actors are, really. There's absolutely no bad or even average performance in this film. But there are countless above average and great things in this film. As I was rewatching this film recently for the dozenth time, I found myself pausing the film and just taking a moment to marvel at the writing. The dialogues in this film are amazing! And I knew that already, of course I did, but this time it for some reason really hit me. And every time I watch this film it's like that. Sometimes it's the dialogue, sometimes it's the characters, or the action or the themes. But it's always something that makes me feel like I'm watching something unique, something important.No doubt this film is not as life-defining to all people as it is to me. But I doubt there's a person who can deny its quality. Or rather there are those who do, but we have a name for them. We call them liars.",Null,0,1,2 January 2018
The Dark Knight," Tragedy of the Bat
","Considered by many to be Christopher Nolan's best film so far and in many ways his heaviest yet. I mean, it's a superhero film alright, but it's not told like it. It's very much a crime story, almost a thriller, and it deals with heavy themes. Fallibility of man, freedom of choice, demands of power, corruption, madness, inevitability of defeat, human weakness. And at the same time we get our usual Batman goodness with chase scenes, stealth and extremely cool gadgets. And none of it takes away from the heaviness of the story.Heath Ledger has received unbelievable amounts of praise for his role. And yeah, let's be honest and admit that part of it is because of his untimely demise shortly after filming the said role. But, most of it is because it's simply such a powerful performance. The scene where The Joker goes to talk to the mob nails the character perfectly. Absolutely terrifying and unhinged, but also kind of funny, but in a very lethal way. And this keeps up throughout the rest of the film, with twist after twist, nail biter after nail biter. It's hard to describe this movie scene by scene afterwards, because there are simply so many of them, but it's more about the mood and the inevitability of its conclusion. The Joker and Batman are on a collision course. The unstoppable force is about to meet the immovable object.This is one of my favourite films. Everything in it works, from actor performances to the technical aspects to the script. And it keeps getting better and better the more I watch it. Some say superhero stories are modern day Greek myths, and I think this is the film where that's truer than ever.",Null,0,1,11 March 2016
Into the Wild," Beautiful movie, idiotic main character
","With this review I have to keep two things separate. What I thought about the movie itself and what I thought about the main character, who's based on a real person. Because I had a hard time dealing with this guy during the film. He felt like one of those overly arrogant Nietzsche-quoters, who always think that they know the truth better than anyone else and are not afraid to show it. So yeah, I wasn't really rooting for this guy, which is a sad thing, because the movie itself is a great character study about following through with your dreams, believing in yourself and the dangers that follow with doing so.And while I cannot agree with the main character of the movie, I can still admire the movie itself. Because it is put together extremely well. The pacing, the scenery, the storytelling, they all fit together to form a coherent story that's both touching and tragic at the same time. The fact that really caught my notice was the quality of the actors and the sheer scale of different characters. You could really see the effect that the main character had on the people he met during his travels and thus the final lesson he ever learned was all the more sadder because of it. In two short years he traveled all across the country, experiencing and truly living. I enjoyed the movie immensely when the main character was just a young man on a road trip and not some large than life wannabe, who was ready to ignore every hint of common sense in order to prove something to himself.And I do get the fact that the movie is based on a real story, so they really couldn't make the movie any different, but it's still hard to watch a movie during which you just want to punch the main character and tell him to grow up and accept some responsibility. And yes, movies are about showing us different point of view, different ways of thinking, but there are limits to what you can take before it just starts to get on your nerves.So yeah, I was left feeling extremely conflicted after this film. On the other hand I despised the main character, his dogma and his cheerful ignorance of everything worth living in this world. But on the other hand I must admit that the movie told his story masterfully, with skill rarely seen anymore. In the end I guess I'm glad that I saw this movie, if not for any other reason than to avoid making the same mistakes and, on the other hand, to live my life to its fullest, happy that I'm here to experience it.",Null,0,0,2 January 2012
Annie Hall," Smug and condescending - which is of course the joke
","A movie directed by Woody Allen, who's also playing the lead role. A movie about a neurotic New York comedian, who recalls us with tales about his dating history, while constantly complaining about how hard it is to hold a girl when you're an egotistical, backboneless loser with a misogynistic streak a mile wide. And that's the only joke this film has. The only one.To be fair, there's more to this movie than its humour. Allen has stated that the film is not meant to be autobiographical, but that's a bit hard to swallow watching the film. It's constantly talking about New York, holocaust movies, being a Jew in modern America, death literature, psychoanalysis and every single other thing that you can pin on Allen.And throughout this all Singer (Allen) and his dysfunctional relationships are under the microscope. To the film's credit it doesn't try to portray Singer as a hero. The character himself thinks that he's simply misunderstood and not to blame, but the actual film makes it more than clear that the culprit in Singer's case can be found by looking into a mirror. Except when it doesn't. Because there are scenes that shift the blame on society and its way of making people unable to form lasting relationships. Meaning that the film is essentially saying, 'Sorry, Singer, but you cannot get the girl because you're an awful person. But it's not your fault, not really. You had no chance of being anything but an awful person.' And I don't like that the film is contradicting itself like this.It also doesn't help that I don't really like Woody Allen films in general. They're simply too snobbish and smug for me. If this movie, for example, was a person, it would be a rail thin wannabe artist, who would look down his nose at you unless you could talk with them about the emptiness of human soul caused by the modern information age in relation to Marxist theory as fulfilled in post-war Africa.This movie has its fan, as has Woody Allen in general, but I can only hope that I don't wake up one day and find myself having become one.",Null,1,3,15 November 2018
2001: A Space Odyssey," Mind-boggling, especially for its time
","One of Stanley Kubrick's greatest works - which is saying something - and still considered by a great many people to be the greatest science fiction film ever made.It is a film that takes us from the very beginning to the very end. Starting from space, slowly and majestically approaching prehistoric Earth, settling us in to witness the birth of mankind. And it keeps going on from there. All the way to the end.The one thing that impressed me the most about this film is its technical supremacy. This is a film that was made in the 60s. Computer effects had barely been imagined back then and they wouldn't be widely used in decades. And yet this film has some of the most amazing visual shots I've ever seen. I frankly have no idea how they even made some of them. Or, at least, made them without going to ridiculous lengths in set-building. And it looks great, perfect even.As for the story, it's a Kubrick alright. None of the man's films are what you would call fast-paced, but this right here just might take the cake. I enjoyed the beginning a lot. The slow pace allowed for the majesty of the imagery to shine and it reflected the slow build-up of mankind rather beautifully. But the space scenes did not pick up the pace, and I do think that they should have. Just a little bit. I get that the style is what it is and when the mood leans more towards horror, it does work, but I still think that the same story could have been told in a briefer fashion. Easily.Still, I cannot fault the film too much. It is quite unique in its mood, approach, story and scope. An iron hard classic for a reason and definitely an inspiration for all the science fiction that would follow. Owe it to yourself to give it a chance.",Null,6,10,25 July 2018
Toy Story," Cornerstone cinema
","In many ways Toy Story is just as big of a film as Snow White, or My Neighbor Totoro. It is the first of its kind, really. The very first feature-length computer-animated film and the founding stone of Pixar Studios. And quite like Snow White, it is still a marvelous film. With certain, minor caveats.First the praise. The story is still incredible. It has to be for the film to have withstood the test of time so well. It is about toys coming to life when humans are away at least partly because toys were much easier to animate than real humans (the humans in this film look scary, by the way), but great storytelling is often inspired by limitations. And that certainly applies here. Through simple childhood toys we explore the concepts of growing up, learning new things, meeting new people, dealing with failed expectations, fear of loss, abandonment and betrayal, letting go of things, and most importantly, about friendship and family. And it's all told through a fetching, relatable and kid-friendly narrative.The characters are also a lot of fun, though as a kid I never realized what a jerk Woody (Tom Hanks) really is. Sure, that's his point, but I always though that the cowboy had something of a point. Perhaps kids see these things differently. And nevertheless, the idea that Woody was in the wrong was clear even back then.Unfortunately what hasn't aged so well is the animation. The humans look terrible, yes, but that was clear even in 1995. But the toys were phenomenal back then. Mindblowing, quite frankly. Less so today. The movement is still really smooth and the designs are interesting, but it all looks so plasticky. The movie works around that admirably - most of the characters are made of plastic, after all - but it still leaves the movie looking flat and lifeless even when it's not supposed to look like it. I've heard it said that early hand-drawn animation looks charmingly simple, whereas early computer-animation simply looks cheap. And there's some truth to that, I'm afraid to tell.Still, Toy Story is a classic. Not my favourite Pixar film by far, but it did start something quite wonderful.",Null,1,1,20 February 2018
The Graduate," Fools, dancing around in a vicious circle
","Young Benjamin Braddock (Dusting Hoffman) has just graduated from college, but now he doesn't seem to know what to do with his life. His parents are not of much help, being more interested in climbing the social ladder and having him help them along as the perfect, dutiful son.Enter Mrs. Robinson (Anne Bancroft), an old family friend, with whom Ben begins an affair to relieve some of his inner anxiety. Later on he also meets Mrs. Robinson's daughter, Elaine (Katharine Ross).The Graduate could be seen as a romantic comedy. The plot itself, if a bit heavy, especially for its time, is lighthearted enough and the character archetypes on display are such that the jokes practically write themselves. Yet a dark undercurrent floats just beneath the surface, transforming the whole thing into a scathing satire. The song The Sound of Silence, by Simon & Garfunkel, is often played over central scenes, almost functioning as the theme for the whole film. And anyone who has ever heard the song knows that it's rather dark in its message, despite the light melody. 'Hello darkness, my old friend' indeed.What this film is trying to talk about is being trapped in a circle from which you cannot escape. Ben's character gets progressively worse as the movie goes on, but you cannot really blame him, not entirely. You can see from his parents and from Mrs. Robinson and her husband that he's merely imitating the sins of the last generation. It's easy to see that he and Elaine could very easily end up just as shallow and empty as their parents. It wouldn't take much. And that's the horror behind the usual rom-com antics.A peculiar film. It requires you to look underneath the surface, to question the events that are taking place. And for that it needs to be praised.",Null,1,1,11 August 2018
Singin' in the Rain," There's certainly a lot of singing, some of it even in the rain
","A movie about the early years of Hollywood. More specifically, about the transition period between the silent era and the so called talkies. One of the most well-known musicals of all time. The best musical of all time, if some critics are to be believed.And there definitely is a lot of musical content. The movie sees no problem in bursting into a song and dance number whenever it pleases. I'd even argue that it's a bit much. By the time the seventh or so tap dancing sequence rolled around, I was ready to throw in the towel. Granted, some of the song numbers are absolutely phenomenal, like the titular Singin' in the Rain or Good Morning that comes immediately before it.Luckily the film hits its stride around the middle and it's a much smoother sailing from there. Or I just got used to it. Who can say.The acting is also very good, which helps a lot. Gene Kelly not also directed the film, he also plays the lead role, and he's certainly having a blast with it. Debbie Reynolds and Donald O'Connor, playing Kelly's love interest and best buddy, respectively, are also great and their joined song numbers are easily the most entertaining ones.Character-wise, the one thing I didn't quite get is the character of Lina Lamont (Jean Hagen), the acting partner of Kelly's character. She's showcased as this great villain and is the primary antagonist of the film, but the way the film tried to portray her never quite matched with the actual character. Sure, she's self-centered, narcissistic and willing to trample others in her pursuit of fame, but she never seemed all that malicious to me. It seemed much more like she didn't know any other way to act.A film that certainly earns its status as a classic. It's a product of its era and quite different from modern films, but it has a lot of charm and energy, which carry it far. Recommended for fans of the musical genre.",Null,1,1,13 August 2018
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," Mindtrip love story
","Director Michel Gondry and writer Charlie Kaufman's most notable feature film. A story about two estranged lovers, who both decide to undergo a treatment that makes them completely forget one another. But during the treatment one of them, while reliving all the good times they had, decides that he doesn't want to forget.The film is also known for being one of Jim Carrey's finest roles, and probably also the one where he uses his comedic talents the least, which doesn't hinder the movie in any way. The film certainly has its humorous moments, but Carrey plays his role very seriously, as a man torn down to his foundations, suffering from betrayal, loss and melancholy. The bizarre tone of the film means that achieving any serious drama is that much more difficult, but Carrey pulls it off beautifully.Kate Winslet does a great job as the main female lead as well, and the film features some really big names, including Elijah Wood, Mark Ruffalo and Kirsten Dunst, in the side roles. All of them give very grounded, serious performances, keeping with the down to earth tone of the film.Saying anything more would very likely ruin the whole film. It is a unique story about love, the importance of memories and pulling yourself through even the hardest of times. Trust me when I say that it's worth a watch.",Null,0,2,29 August 2015
Elysium," Unimaginative and boring
","The very premise and idea of Elysium is non-original and stale. It's your basic dystopian future where the rich have raised high walls using high-end technology to keep the poor out and it's up to a single brave soul to make the difference. We've seen this millions times before and unfortunately Elysium doesn't really offer us anything new or exciting to make up for its basic storyline.The other problem are the actors. Jodie Foster is a great actress, but the script doesn't give her much to work with and her character comes of as stereotypical power hungry military politician. Sharlto Copley's Kruger is certainly a memorable character, helped along by his weird accent and general hamminess - easily the most enjoyable character in the movie. But alas, Matt Damon once again proves that he isn't all that well-suited for action hero roles. He does much better in thrillers - Bourne franchise springs to mind - where the main character can be more of a everyman with certain badass characteristics. A straight up scifi action film like Elysium needs someone like Stallone or Schwarzenegger to be truly enjoyable. Someone who screams badassery and danger. You don't get that with Damon, no matter how bald or ripped he makes himself to appear.Still, none of the main actors are terrible or ruin the film by themselves. Ultimately it's the lackluster premise and predictable storyline that make this so boring to watch. And yet the technical aspects are up to par, I have no complaints about the action scenes and even the characters and the story are not bad, they're not just that interesting. If you're looking for a solid action scifi film, I've seen much worse.",Null,0,1,10 June 2014
Once Upon a Time in America," About as epic as a gangster movie can get
","First of all, see the director's cut, because it's much more truthful to the original vision of Sergio Leone. Second of all, if you're a fan of gangster movies, this movie is a must see one. It's right up there with The Godfather trilogy in terms of sheer scope, majesty and brilliance of storytelling. And yet the movies are very different. The Godfather is more about the mafia and old crime families whereas this movie is much more from rags to riches kind of story. And it is one that has influenced its genre greatly. Scorsese's Goodfellas for example owns a lot of its basic story, style and characters to this piece.Although in my opinion Goodfellas tells its story a bit better. Once Upon a Time in America is told in non-chronological fashion with many early scenes getting their background and explanation near the end of the film. The director's cut is the one where this non-chronological order is maintained as it was 'fixed' for the initial release in many places. I can understand the reasoning behind that decision as the movie is kind of hard to follow unless you pay a lot of attention or are willing to watch it twice, but it really takes something away from the vision if you mess with the director's initial ideas, so see the director's cut even if it requires a bit more from you as a viewer.That being said, the story has some ambiguity to it, which either works for you or not. For me, it kind of did. The movie has that epic feel to it, depending more on its themes, the atmosphere and the actors to relay its message of fighting your way through heavy odds, disregarding the rules of the society and making up your own rules, depending on your brothers and bowing down to no one. Classical gangster movie themes, but this film really solidifies them into their pure form.Special mentions should also go to the cast and the score, which were both beyond measure. Robert De Niro, Ennio Morricone, Joe Pesci, James Woods... How can you go wrong with people like that. They really took this movie and made it their own with perfectly delivered lines, atmospheric and highly memorable pieces of music and sheer talent.Still, I can't say that this movie deserves a higher grade than what I gave it. Its individual pieces are all about perfect, but the way that the story is told and the length of the film drag it down just the tiniest bit. I can respect the artistic vision behind those both aspects and I can clearly see why some regard this as their favourite movie of all time, but I personally prefer Goodfellas. It's a great movie, but not the greatest.",Null,0,4,20 April 2012
Taken," Excellent action thriller
","A film that solidified Liam Neeson's action star credentials and launched him into superstardom. Taken hearkens back to the good old days of action movies when action stars were unbeatable badasses, the plots were comfortingly black-n-white yet still gritty and the violence had purpose, style and weight behind it.Taken's pace is at the same time a source of much criticism as well as one of its greatest strengths. The fact is that the story does contain a lot of happy coincidences that in the hands of a lesser director would have made the film superficial and unbelievable. But because the pacing is so tight and because the film can flow from one breathtaking action scene to other without a pause, you can ignore these serendipities.And what action scenes those are. They would be interesting being performed by pretty much anybody, but they're given an extra boost by Neeson, who can expertly sell both the anguished father and the retired badass aspects of his character. His background in drama helps him to alleviate this above a mere shoot-em-up.Taken is one of the best action movies of the 00s and an excellent movie to pick up if you're looking for intense action, deeper characters and all around entertainment.",Null,1,1,27 September 2014
Avatar," Nigh perfect entertainment
","There have been perhaps two or three films in my lifetime that have been so good that I went back into the movie theater to see them a second time. This one's one of them.Director James Cameron has been one of Hollywood's most successful and most prolific film makers for a long time. My personal theory is that he's just so good at giving the audience exactly what they want to see in order to be pleased, shocked, rejuvenated, excited and entertained. After the box office miracle story that was Titanic, he moved away from the central stage and only returned back to full-length feature film with this one: Avatar, the highest-grossing film of all time, managing to surpass even Titanic. And thus Cameron has directed the two highest-grossing films of all time. That's pure talent.So what makes Avatar so interesting and so engrossing? Well, on the technical side of things, at the time of its release, Avatar was THE best looking film we had ever seen. Four years have since passed and it has withstood the test of time remarkably well, and I think that it will continue to do so. It's an utterly breath-taking film. The foreign world of Pandora opens in front of your eyes in thousands of shades of colour, each individual plant, creature and mountain a miracle to look at in its own right. Gorgeous, beautiful, majestic, awe-inspiring are all words that this films easily earns.This artistry alone would warrant me to recommend this film, but I also happen to like the story and the characters a great deal. Avatar has been accused of rehashing old 'white man amongst natives' story lines. It has been accused of being just a ripoff of Dances with Wolves, Pocahontas, Ferngully and countless other similar films. I don't get these people. The stories have similarities, yes, and Avatar is a bit predictable, but do these people really claim that if a particular story has already been told, you are not allowed to try and make a better version of that story, your version? Because that's what Avatar is. It's this generation's 'amongst natives' story, told with gorgeous imagery, great characters and exciting storytelling. So what if you can predict how the story's going to end. The same holds true for all the romantic comedies, most of the action films and all the sport films, yet people don't complain when those have a storyline that's similar to previous films. Well, okay, some do, but not as vehemently as they did in the case of Avatar. Backlash against its success, maybe? Avatar's story is just fine. It's the visuals, the world, the music and the characters that make an adventure film like this work, and all four of those are great. I've already stated my opinion about Pandora and how it looks on screen. James Horner's score fits the mood and style of the film perfectly, being grandiose, little bit foreign and dramatic. Likewise with the actors that all do a really good job. Sam Worthington and Zoe Saldana have great chemistry together as Jake Sully, the crippled marine, and Neytiri, the princess of the Na'vi. Special mention should also go to Stephen Lang and his character Colone Miles Quaritch, one of the most badass soldiers in recent cinema history.Longish review, but that's because it's a movie that divides opinions. Some people seem to hate it because of its seeming unoriginality, others focus on the good sides and absolutely love it. I belong to the latter camp and thus Avatar belongs amongst my favourite movies of all time. See it, if you haven't already.",Null,1,3,9 January 2014
Toy Story 2," Excellent sequel
","Toy Story 2 brings as back to Andy's toy chest and all those quirky little toys that inhabit it. By now Buzz Lightyear has become an accepted and valued member of the extended family and a lifelong friend to Woody. But once again the peace and quiet of the toys is disturbed, this time by Woody being kidnapped by a toy collector.Toy Story 2 hits primarily the same points its predecessor did. The fear of being abandoned, the fear of loosing one's friends, the fear of change. In a nutshell, the fear of growing up, told through the medium of sentient toys. But the story is different enough that, even though the basic message is the same, it feels like a continuation of a story rather than a repeat.It helps that the characters have grown. Woody and Buzz especially. Sure they still have their individual personalities, but I like that they have become such good friends. The new characters are also a lot of fun and have a great backstory connected to them. I could watch a whole movie just about them.But yeah, it is very similar to the original and there is something to be said about novelty. This is a very good movie, especially for children, but it is not the original. You're going to love seeing all your beloved characters come to life once again, but you're probably not going to learn anything you didn't learn in the first film.Does this mean it's not worth a watch?

The Artist," Nostalgic remembrance
","It's funny how within the same year we had Hugo, a Hollywood film that glorified the early French cinema, and The Artist, a French film that glorified the early Hollywood cinema. Yet both are very different as independent movies. Perhaps these two films shouldn't be compared like this, but I can't help it. To me Hugo feels more familiar. It tried to portray how movies were made during that time, but it still feels much more recent, the films aesthetics play to the norms of the modern day. All the colours, all the visuals. The setting is historical, but it's still a film that has clearly been done during the 21th century.Not so much with The Artist, which genuinely feels and looks like a silent film of the early 20th century. And I love it because of it. The 1.33:1 screen ratio, the complete lack of dialogue or even environmental sounds (with one very haunting and effective exception), the use of music to tell a story, the constant mugging that still manages to look somewhat genuine, the black-and-white visuals - they all feel real and only the quality of the picture separates this from a genuine silent film. Well, that, and some singular scenes where the movie actually has some sound effects to create certain effects. Which is a point to the movie's favour, mind you, because even though this movie tries to imitate a silent film as much as possible, it still recognizes the fact that it's a modern film and can use certain effects that were not available during the time of its role models. Furthermore, the subject of the film is the coming of the so called talkies, so the occasional use of sound is easily called for.So it really is a rather good film. Its very idea is easily the best part of it, but the individual aspects of the film easily keep up. The actors are very talented at what they do with Jean Dujardin's performance being every bit Oscar-worthy, though I personally think that B√©r√©nice Bejo does equally good job as his counterpart. There's just this genuine joy to her and her dancing. And of course the music is fantastic. It has to be or the film just wouldn't work, because the score is the only thing that we will hear most of the time.The movie has no obvious flaws, though the story is both intriguing and a bit predictable at the same time. But that's me nitpicking. It's a good movie and easily worth your time. And most importantly: it made me interested in silent films. And to this film that is the highest compliment that anyone can assign.",Null,0,2,14 June 2012
Mission: Impossible," Earns its reputation
","Mission Impossible is one of those movies pretty much everyone knows, along with Dirty Harry, Die Hard and the like. And rightfully so, as it is a very solid action piece with memorable scenes, interesting plot twists and masterfully recycled classics and clich√©s. It's one of those movies that define a genre, in this case an action/heist genre.Of the listed good qualities, I'd definitely pick the memorable scenes as the one thing that keeps this film in people's minds. This film is full of iconic scenes that have been remade, praised and parodied ever since. From the hanging computer heist to the chase sequence on top of the train, I'd say that if you haven't seen the original, you've probably seen many of its scenes in slightly different variations in other films. They're that good. Other memorable and well-done things include the score, obviously, and the story that's not terribly original or new, but which has been given a different spin to make it feel like it's original and new.On the downside, the characters aren't very good, in my honest opinion. The actors playing them are terrific, even though I'm not a big fan of Tom Cruise, but they're not given much to work with. The main character Ethan Hunt especially just doesn't have that larger than life quality that John McClane and Harry Callahan have in abundance. He's not a bad character, none of them are, he's just not very memorable. He's a set piece, there to move the plot along, more than anything.It's still very watchable movie, but not on my personal list of the top action films of all time. Still, every fan of action movies has seen it at least once, which is pretty much the highest compliment that you can pay to a movie, and it has earned that compliment.",Null,0,0,4 November 2012
La La Land," I love it, yet I hate it, but I still love it... while hating it
","They say a great work of art makes you feel something. Still, I'm not convinced this is what they had in mind. Because this movie... this movie...It's about Hollywood. And it's about music. And art. And dreams. And about chasing all of those. It's set in the modern times, oddly enough, yet its style and way of talking, way of experiencing, is straight from the olden times. It's Hollywood nostalgia at its finest. From the big showstopper musical numbers to its characters and stereotypes and stories.And I love it. Both the main characters, with Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling giving career-defining performances. Their romance, their differences, their passions, all of them exhilarating, and you could spend decades strolling down the streets and boulevards, singing songs in smoky clubs, basking in the sun that shines just for them.And I hate it. For every musical piece of genius, there's a number that makes me feel manipulated. For every moment of such beauty that it makes me tremble and wish to be a better poet to express it properly, there's a moment when you want to take the movie by the throat and demand what's wrong with it, why is it they way it is. Why does it insist on dragging itself down with its melancholy and forced realism.On and on it goes and by the end I was left exhausted by conflicting emotions. With such minor changes I could have had a movie that would have inspired me for years to come. Yet what I hate about the film also makes it stronger. Because what I hate are not flaws but differing ideals. Because while this film is all about Hollywood nostalgia and dreams, it's also about that which was always left outside when talking about those things. And that's not something I can argue against.So here's to the dreamers. But also those that wake up in the morning. Those that fail. Those that don't achieve their dreams. And here's to those that keep on dreaming.",Null,1,6,14 June 2017
Super 8," Love letter to the early Spielberg films
","What if E.T. had been caught by government agents and was then experimented upon for years before managing to escape? Okay, sure, that's not the exact story here, but it tells you the style and mood the film is going for. Or would have gone for, had Spielberg decided to make his legendary film with such a story back in the 80s. In many ways this film feels and acts like a retelling of that movie, even having Spielberg working on it as its producer.And for the most part, it works. The story this time around is that a bunch of kids are looking to shoot a movie of their own for a film competition. One of them, Charles (Riley Griffiths), is a budding director, mad about stories and cameras, while the main character of the film, Joe (Joel Courtney), works as his special effects and makeup guy. They even manage to convince a cute girl from school, Alice (Elle Fanning), to act in their film. Then things take a turn for the weirder when they witness a train crash while shooting a train station scene. And before they know it, their small town is swarming with military and odd things start happening all around.Very classic Spielberg, with bits and pieces of Stephen King thrown in for added flavour. But I mean that in a good way. It feels nostalgic, like something we haven't seen in decades, but which still feels instantly familiar and comforting. Sure its depiction of American small town life is very idyllic and romanticized, but it still deals with darker themes as well, with Alice coming from a rougher part of town and with Joe's problems with his dad, who's both absent and over-protective at the same time.Unfortunately, while the film has the style and mood down pat, I'm not a huge fan of the story. A truly great film often works because you can identify with all the characters, no matter how strange or twisted they are. E.T. was very sympathetic and identifiable, but you could understand the point of view of the government agents as well. Not so much here. The antagonists are very unlikable, or aren't given any screen time for us to understand them. They're simply there because the film needs a villain, a monster for the kids to overcome. Sure, there are attempts by the script to make the villains more justified in their actions, but it's once again a case of telling, not showing, which makes it way less effective.Still, I do like all the kid characters and most of the townsfolk are enjoyable as well. The film honestly looks amazing, has a good soundtrack and even story is by no means bad. It just doesn't quite live up to the films it's paying homage to.",Null,0,1,7 February 2016
Sinister," Effective horror film
","Sinister is a classic horror story told with style. A family moves into town to live in an old house that was the place of a brutal tragedy some time ago. Now, in real world, this would merely bring the price down a little bit and that would be it. But of course in cinema world you can pretty much kiss most, if not all, of the family goodbye instantly, as all of you pretty much guessed the very instant I uttered the words 'old house'. This could very well be a Stephen King novel. It even has a writer as a protagonist. Yet I don't mean that in a bad way. It's an effective formula, if you can keep it from feeling too stale.Which Sinister does, for the most part. Much of that is helped by the lead man, Ethan Hawke, whose acting capabilities and charisma keep you focused on the film. The atmosphere builds largely around his growing unease and horror as he starts to realize that this time he might have found something real - without having considered what that would mean for him and his family.The rest of the cast does okay, but none of them stand out or really shine all that much. I have to wonder what this movie might have been if they had gotten another actor of Hawke's caliber.The other major problem is the ending, like it often is. The majority of the film is mood and atmosphere over slasher horror and jump scares, which is a major plus. There are a couple instances of both, but they're done well and you don't grow tired of them. And then the ending just sort of happens and it's not as satisfying as it could have been. I would like to say I don't mind it being predictable, because in horror the journey is more important, but I will say that it wraps up the loose ends a bit too nicely. There's no punch to it. I will remember Hawke's performance long after I've forgotten this particular ending.Sinister is one of the better horror films I've seen in years, which to my regret isn't saying all that much. It has a lot of good things going for it, but I get the sense that they just didn't manage to pull in enough talent to really make it work. Definitely worth a watch if you're a fan of horror, though.",Null,0,1,18 March 2015
3 Idiots," About finding your path
","This blast of a Bollywood movie tells about two friends travelling with their old enemy in search of their college roommate, who they have not seen since graduation day. During their travel they reminiscence about their college days, and let's just say that those days did not suffer from a lack of excitement.The film is very much a comedy, but it has undertones of satire when it comes to India's school system and the way students are so pushed to excel, to get good grades, to get a good jobs, to provide for their families through success, that it often leads to self-destructive throughts and behaviour.Nevertheless, for the most part the focus of the film is on these three friends and their individual ways to get through college. And in that aspect the film absolutely shines. These are three great characters, each played masterfully by their respective actors. Their ordeals during college are pretty unbelievable, but in a good way. I also like that the film can be serious and solemn when the situation calls for it. There are touching scenes in this film, which almost made me teary-eyed.If I had to name a flaw, I would say that the film is a bit on the long side. I did find myself checking the clock once or twice towards the end. The film has enough content to keep you interested until the very end, but some could definitely be trimmed.Still, this is a great film. Great dialogues, amazing characters, clever plot twists and enough energy to keep you going for days. Heavily recommended.",Null,1,1,21 October 2018
Life Is Beautiful," A sorrowful tale of a man's willingness to endure with a smile
","Guido, a young and more than a bit whimsical man (Roberto Benigni), arrives at city, being promised a place of work in a hotel operated by his uncle. Quick-witted and always with a laughter on his lips, he swiftly becomes a much beloved fixture as a waiter. In the city he also meets a young school teacher, to whom he makes sure to run every now and then, as if by happenstance. And slowly his cleverness and pleasant attitude start to win over this sweet lady.Unfortunately it's the end of the 30s and they happen to be a Jewish family.This film is a comedy. But whereas the first half of the film was a fertile ground for laughter and merriment, it becomes a bit harder to laugh when the comedy comes from a frightened father trying to convince to his son that the horrors of a concentration camp are merely make belief. And that, right there, is exactly why this film is so beautiful. Because he still tries, for his son. He tries, swallowing back tears, not even knowing if his wife, his son's mother, is still alive. But he tries. And it's funny. You absolutely belief why the small child would buy all this nonsense. Yet it's also horrendous. You want to laugh, but there's the shadow of the horror that was the holocaust. And you feel bad for wanting to laugh, while also admiring the fact that the father can elicit this reaction from you.In Guido crystallize some of the best qualities of a humankind. What a hero, what a father, what a human being.Some have argued that comedy should have no place in a holocaust movie. That to have jokes in such a film is to make mockery of the suffering of millions. Quite frankly I'm not sure those arguers have seen the film, because to have these jokes in this kind of a film is to make the horror even more horrible.",Null,0,1,8 March 2018
Up," About dealing with the past
","First of all, the silent opening of this film is one of the finest pieces of cinema I've ever seen. The initial meeting between Carl and Ellie, their life together and the loss at the end, is a story in and on itself. Pixar is often at its finest when there's no dialogue. And this is the crowning achievement in that. Sure, there is some dialogue at the initial meeting, but after that it's pure visual storytelling. And it is glorious!If only the rest of the film could have been as good. And yes, I'm taking the mickey out of you. Kinda. It's still a really good film, suitable for all ages, while still retaining that core of values, depth and wisdom that marks all great Disney/Pixar films.That being said, I'm not a huge fan of the storyline. Going to South America is fine and the fact that it is achieved with balloon is just one of those precious things that just works despite its innate insanity. Put then we get introduced to the dogs. And the birds. And Christopher Plummer's character. Which all put together leave me with mixed feelings. They're good on their own. The dogs are fun, especially Alpha and Dug. Plummer's character can be both charismatic as well as menacing. The bird is... well okay, the bird is just silly, frankly speaking. Put it's the mix of them that has the hiccups. This movie could have been this great pulp adventure. Especially if you just kept the Plummer character and got rid of the rest. Put it's not. It's simply... silly.Not to say that the silliness doesn't work. It also helps a lot that both Carl and his junior woodchuck partner in crime Russell are both fantastic characters. Carl especially is one of my favourite Pixar characters of all time. Perfectly curmudgeon, but still extremely likable and sympathetic.I honestly think that I might like this movie better as a whole if it didn't have that opening narration. But it has and it is so good that the rest of the film pales in comparison. Still, very much worth a watch and one of Pixar's better ones.",Null,0,0,6 September 2019
Up," A bit too sporadic for my tastes, but still a really good film
","For me, Pixar has always been at their best when they don't try to tell you anything, they simply allow the animation to tell its own story. Likewise with this film. The early silent montage of Carl (voiced by Edward Asner) and Ellie (Elie Docter) getting married and just growing old together is... it's unbelievable. Beautiful, touching, heart-breaking, it's one of the most potent scenes I've seen in a long time. Had the rest of the film been equally as good, this film would be in my Top Five.Alas, for me this film's downfall are its characters. I honestly really like Carl alone. He has this wonderful curmudgeon thing down pat, yet he's still extremely likable and you feel for the guy. Especially because you've just seen a few minutes ago what a great guy and husband he was, and now he has to struggle with both the loss of his wife and the loss of his dreams. Great, great character.The rest... are okay, for the most part. I never formed any connection with them like I've done with many other Pixar characters. Russell (Jordan Nagai) strays between being annoying and being sympathetic, Charles Muntz's (Christopher Plummer) presence in the film is just bawling, the bird just elicited a bored 'huh' out of me and the dogs... well, the dogs were actually okay in a good way. They got a few laughs out of me and they were both cute and menacing as the story demanded.I have nothing bad to say about the story, which is a sweet and interesting romp through various situations, all of which look great and keep up your interest. But even a great story is built on top of its characters and if you don't feel for those characters, the story is really nothing more than a series of scenes, locations and actions strung together.I feel like I'm being too negative here. This is a good film. It's great for kids and adults alike, it has one great character in it and the rest are up to the task as well, it looks amazing and has some wonderfully imaginative scenes in it. For some reason I personally don't care too much for it, but that's just me and pretty much everyone else I know loves this film. I'm sure you will as well.",Null,0,1,10 January 2014
Rio," Fun little animated adventure
","Rio is the story of Blu, a very rare blue macaw, who has ended up as the pet of a Minnesotan bookstore owner. Events transpire to take him all the way to Rio de Janeiro to meet the last remaining female of his species. Hijinks ensue due to a pair of animal traffickers.Blue Sky Studios is most well-known for its Ice Age films, which are definitely funny, but have their fair share of cringy moments as well. Thus, I was pleasantly surprised by this film. It's not very deep, nor will it make you challenge your views of the world or to grow as a person - like something from Disney or Pixar might do - but it is a solid animation movie for the whole family.The characters are likable, for one. They're pretty one-note in certain respects, but their voice actors are talented and they're given enough interesting things to say and do that you care about what happens to them. I also like that there's some actual character growth. And in a way that feels both natural and earned.It's also a very colourful film. Fitting, keeping in mind the Brazilian setting. All the different birds look suitably lifelike and I do admire the fact that they've kept the sizes lifelike as well. There are certain birds that are teeny tiny and there are some that are huge. As it should be.Is it great entertainment? No, not really. But it is all-around likable.

Groundhog Day," Within every man there's goodness, given enough time
","One of the most well-known Bill Murray films, a movie that defined a whole subgenre of time travel fiction ‚Äì the so called 'Groundhog Day Loop' ‚Äì while also being a sweet love story in its own right. Nowadays it's a loved classic, and for a good reason. Its premise is really rather simple, a man is forced to live out the exact day over and over again, but the film makers explore its possibilities to their fullest, giving us a tale about the meaning of human interaction, loneliness and the depths we can either sink or rise when there's no one to witness us.This is Bill Murray's film, through and through. His performance was the one that would either make or break the film, and he pulls it off magnificently. He gives us everything. The initial confusion, the horror of realization, the rage against the heavens, the joy of possibilities, the descend into monotony, the despair that comes with time, the strength to still move forwards. All this given with just the right amount of snark to keep the tone comedic, while also selling the depth of the story. I've never seen him show us more range and scale than in this movie.Andie MacDowell also shines as the female lead, and the various other actors give us a nice setting in the sleepy town of Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania. I don't think this film would have worked as well as it does now if the setting had been a larger city. Now you get to know the locale, the various inhabitants, which makes the humour and drama that much more poignant.Groundhog Day is a fantastic film. Its premise and idea are pure fantasy comedy, but it rounds it up with heavy doses of emotion and drama, while still keeping it lighthearted enough to entertain. And it's those few darker moments that make the overall film shine all that much brighter.",Null,3,4,5 September 2015
National Treasure," Indiana Jones for the new generation
","I've heard tales about archaeology professors who insist on opening their first lectures with the following words: 'Indiana Jones has nothing to do with real archaeology!' And I like to imagine that at that point about half of their pupils get up and leave, with their little hearts broken. But can you really blame them. Indiana Jones made archaeology and history cool, as well as romantic. We traipsed along the pages of history with good old Indy, learning a nugget of information here and there. Keeping that in mind, I wasn't at all surprised that this film became such a success. We've yearned for another Indiana Jones movie for decades, even more so after the disappointment that was the fourth film.And make no mistake, this is an Indiana Jones film at its heart. Sure, Ben Gates (Nicolas Cage) is his own man, but there are a lot of similarities to a certain fedora-wearing globetrotter. Both men of history, highly-educated, with multiple distinctive talents under their belts. Both men of action, who have the wits to out-think all their opponents.But, the films are also dissimilar enough. This film takes place in the modern day and chooses to focus on American history. More specifically the Founding Fathers and the supposed Knights Templar treasure hidden by them to keep it from being abused and stolen. The film also focuses more on the mystery and puzzle solving than any of the Indy films. The treasure is hidden well and it takes a truly knowledgeable man to solve all the clues. And I really like that. I was hooked from the very first riddle.It's also surprisingly well-acted. This is very much my favourite Nicolas Cage film. He plays the character very straight, very serious, with almost none of his usual antics, and the man can really act when he wants to. The supporting actors aren't bad either, with special mention of course going to the esteemed Sean Bean, who manages not to die for once in a movie.This is a must see film for all fans of adventure and especially Indiana Jones. It's the spiritual successor of one of the greatest adventure trilogies ever made and I hope they keep making them.",Null,0,1,8 November 2016
Total Recall," One of the best scifi Arnold films
","The original Total Recall, starring Arnold 'White Hercules' Schwarzenegger, is Paul Verhoeven's cult classic that helped to contextualize the style and aesthetic of science fiction in the 90s. It has since gathered quite a following, thanks to its tremendous camp value, surprisingly layered plot line, Arnold, interesting world design and a great basic premise based on the Philip K. Dick story 'We Can Remember It for You Wholesale'.The mentioned premise goes like this. It's the future and the technology to implant memories into people has recently become reality. Thus it's perfectly possible to experience a whole vacation or journey by going and sitting on a chair in the company that fabricates these memories. Meet Douglas Quaid (Schwarzenegger), a quarry worker who has a dream of going to Mars, which has been colonized fairly recently and is currently undergoing an upheaval. Douglas cannot afford a trip to Mars so he decides to go and experience the eponymous total recall. Except, not all is as it seems to be. Or is it? One of the strengths of the film is the fact that it knows what to explain and what to leave to the viewer to decide for himself. People are still arguing what aspects of the film are reality and what simply happen in Douglas's mind. There are arguments to be made for both sides, but it's much more satisfying to see the film and decide for yourself, so I shall not spoil it for you.This is also one of Schwarzenegger's better performances and he shows a lot of range, while still doing the usual one-liners, action muscle stunts and general silliness that we love about him.Total Recall is well worth a watch if you're looking for a scifi action film that still explores some deeper themes and challenges you to think.",Null,0,1,24 July 2015
Rocky," The underdog story
","A breakthrough in Sylvester Stallone's career and still a role he's most known for, after all these years. A tale of a Philadelphia man down on his luck. He's doing odd jobs, mostly collecting money, trying to get a girlfriend. In his spare time he boxes, but even that is going only so so. Until the heavyweight champion of the world, Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers), offers him a shot at the title, as something of a curiosity event.This movie and the whole franchise that followed are known as the boxing films. 'Have you seen the boxing films?' 'You mean the Rocky films?' 'Yeah, those.' As such it can be something of a surprise to learn that these films, at least the first two, are really not about boxing. Sure, it's the background for the plot and the climax is the match. But it's really about an underdog. About being poor, with no prospects, no future. About being given that single impossible chance at something different. And that's universal, that's all-encompassing.And as just a movie it's also quite lovely. Done with a small budget, with a relatively untested and unknown lead actor, who also happened to write the script. And we also know nowadays that Stallone isn't exactly known for his acting capabilities. Except in these films. In here he's a man speaking from his heart, speaking for an entire generation, an entire class of people.And sure, the film isn't perfect. It's not the most well-shot film there is, the fight choreographies are not what they would eventually end up being and the way Rocky eventually wins over Adrian (Talia Shire) is pretty cringe-worthy to a modern viewer. The film was made in the 70s, let's leave it at that.But, sometimes a story is so good, the characters so iconic, raw and real, the whole experience so strangely life-representing, that all these minor flaws melt away. Rocky is a classic, no doubt about it.",Null,0,0,23 December 2017
Eyes Wide Shut," Dream-like sexual weirdness
","Stanley Kubrick's last film before his death. A film that blurs the borders of dreaming and challenges us to question the differences between reality, dreams, fantasies and nightmares. Sometimes it's just as weird to be awake as it is to dream.Dr. William Harford - played brilliant here by Tom Cruise in a role that might very well be the best he has ever done - flees from his house after hearing a jarring confession from his wife. And thus begins the long night that would haunt him forever.What makes this film so perfect is Kubrick's vision. The pace is so agonizingly slow, the plot so nonsensical, that had it not had one of the best directors of all time at the steering wheel, it would fallen straight to that pile of artsy borefests that only film majors ever watch. But it doesn't. Yes, it's slow, yes it makes no sense whatsoever, but yet it works. I remember glancing at the clock after the film had been going on for a while and I remember asking 'Has it really been two hours already?' Because it didn't feel like it had. The film is hypnotizing. It pulls you in and as Harford wanders around New York, you remain strangely calm about the whole situation. You don't question, why was that character there, why did that scene happen. It just does, it's cool.Part of that calmness comes from the technical side of this film. Kubrick didn't want to use any studio lighting, so instead the crew relied mostly on the various Christmas decorations that they places strategically all over the sets. This gives the film a slightly blurred, soft and ethereal quality, not unlike if you were dreaming the whole time. The soundtrack is also amazingly powerful, underlining each scene with a heavy hand, but never in a way that feels forced. One of the few films where I noticed the sound cues and didn't hate them.I already praised Tom Cruise, but it's also worth noticing that despite this film having huge piles of gratuitous nudity, despite the infamous orgy scene, despite all these weird sexual situations Harford finds himself in, the sexiest thing in the entire film is his wife (Nicole Kidman) leaning against the doorframe in her nightclothes or peering over her glasses. That's talent on Kidman's part and the fact is helped alone by her and Cruise's marriage at the time. They have fantastic chemistry together and Kidman provides us with the needed reality and anchorage.Pretty much the only thing keeping this film from becoming one of my personal favourites is the fact that the ending drags. Not a huge amount, but it does. At that point the musical cues have begun to grow on your nerves, the slow scenes have slipped back into being agonizing and you just want the film to give you its final words and leave you to ponder its mysteries. Instead we get one final conversation before the ending scene between Cruise and Kidman. It doesn't ruin the film for me, but it's a shame that such a great film falters just before the finish line.Still, it's an amazing film. Heavily sexual, but not in a sexy way, it's a journey like you've never taken before. Riddled with phenomenal acting performances, with fantastic production values, ironhand directing and unforgettable scenes, it's a film you're going to remember. May it haunt your fantasies and deepest nightmares.",Null,5,8,17 January 2014
Beauty and the Beast," Watered down version of the original classic
","Aside from this, I have seen Cinderella out of the new live-action Disney adaptations. And they do share certain similarities, but also certain key differences.We all know the story of Beauty and the Beast. Cursed prince, a smart woman feeling trapped in a small provincial village, castle in the middle of nowhere, tale as old as time, and so on. The problem, at least when compared to Cinderella, is that they changed absolutely nothing. It's the exact same story, the exact same songs, the exact same characters. Almost scene by scene the same movie. There are a couple of added scenes that aim to deepen the character of the two main leads, but they seem exactly what they are: tagged on additions to pad out the runtime. Whereas Cinderella, while still sticking to the basic premise, significantly deepened the relationship between the main couple, changed the order of events and felt as a whole like a fresh movie while still paying an homage to the original.On the other hand, the actors are better in this film. Emma Watson has her haters, but I've always liked her and she gives a credible performance here as Belle. Perhaps it's a bit distracting that the character is so similar to Hermione Granger, but that's what you get. Luke Evans makes for an incredible Gaston, probably the best character in the film, and Dan Stevens makes for a credible Beast. Although I do hope that they had made him at least partially with practical effects because now the CGI just isn't quite there with this budget.That being said, the film looks fine overall. I'm not a huge fan of all-CGI effects like in this film, because it just doesn't look real unless done phenomenally well and perhaps not even then, but I can live with it. It helps that the designs and textures are thought out well.As a whole this movie doesn't have much reason for existing. The original Beauty and the Beast looks, sounds and acts better as a story and as a film. These live-action remakes only make sense if you bring something new to the story. Still, as a standalone film, without the context, it's an okay piece of cinema.",Null,1,3,22 June 2017
Sicario," What was the tone supposed to be here?
","Kate Macer (Emily Blunt) is an FBI agent working in Arizona to take down the Mexican drug cartel and their distributors within US. She gets recommended to a joint task force that is designed to take the fight to the enemy on the other side of the border. The team consists of long time veterans of the drug war and it quickly becomes clear that Kate is very much not in the know.Sicario was directed by Denis Villeneuve, who has made a lot of noise recently in the film circles and whose scifi film Arrival is just about to be released. Personally I've seen from him the movie Prisoners. It was a nihilistic, overly dark thriller about the darkness of human condition. It seemed to hate humanity and life in general, setting as its goal to drag the viewer down to dirt with it and make him realize that it's a miserable planet to live on. Deep down everyone is rotten and flawed, most people think only of themselves and even altruistic people are prevented from doing much by those around them. In a word it was depressing. Sicario is the same.Now, to be fair, it is a very professional movie. The cinematography is gorgeous, especially the slow panning shots of Mexico. The realistic style serves the subject matter well. The dialogue is, if not overly memorable, at least interesting enough to follow. And the final confrontation between a member of the task force and the drug cartel boss is a great piece of cinema without a doubt. It's intense, filled with hinted backstory and suitably brutal in its conclusion, fitting the movie as a whole.But here's the problem. The said confrontation is not between Kate and the drug boss. Instead it's Benecio del Toro's character that confronts the boss. And del Toro's character is by far the best in the whole movie. He has the most backstory, the best presence and the most memorable characteristics. So why wasn't the movie about him in the first place? And believe me, I have absolutely no problems with seeing Emily Blunt in a role requiring her to be tough and action-oriented. I know she can pull it off. But in this movie her character is a tool. Now, she is a tool on purpose, because it fits the plot, but it makes the movie aggravating to watch from the audience point of view, because we feel alongside her that we have nothing to contribute. That we have no control. That we're only being used. And yes, that is an intentional choice on the film makers' part, but it's one I cannot agree with.And that's Sicario. It's a well-made crime thriller and probably well-deserving of its praise. I just personally hate its message, its whole style. I don't watch movies to realize that the world is an ugly place. I don't watch them to be depressed. As such, this movie has earned my scorn.",Null,2,4,31 January 2017
Some Like It Hot," Ahead of its time
","Directed by Billy Wilder and starring Marilyn Monroe, Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon, this comedy follows two musicians (Curtis and Lemmon) during the Prohibition Era. The two friends have to flee for their lives after they attract the attention of gangsters in the worst way possible. The solution? Pull on a dress and join an all-female band headed for Florida. What else? Things start to derail when they lay eyes on Sugar (Monroe) and become instantly smitten.Some Like It Hot has topped more than one list as the best comedy ever made. And yes, there is some truth to that. It is a very good comedy. Especially given its age.It has been said that the pinnacle of humour is a dude in drag. And here we have two. The film was made near the end of the so called Hays Code era. This list of rules set very strict rules for what could be shown on screen and what kind of stories could be told, but towards its end these rules were not as ardently enforced. Still, I can imagine that this film was something of a game changer. Men in drag, Monroe's many many curves flashing all around, and plenty of jokes about flirting, fooling women, homosexuality and about how insulted the two main characters are when they're objectified while posing as women.The film is sixty years old now, and while it was very progressive when it came out, it suffers from the gender stereotypes of its day. I don't believe you would see a modern film where Monroe's character was lead around quite so blatantly. Or at the very least it wouldn't be shown as something quite as acceptable.Well okay, they definitely could make a film with such a plot nowadays, but it wouldn't be seen as one of the greatest films ever made. It would have to fight to reach a B-movie status.And that's the great divide of this film. If you believe that films (or any art, really) shouldn't be given a pass for giving offense because of its age, then this is not a movie for you. It has a wide misogynistic streak. But, if you're willing to accept that it was made in the middle of the last century and that despite its best intentions, it does show some bias when it comes to gender roles, then I'd say that it is a very well written, acted and directed movie that will definitely stay with you.",Null,0,1,6 March 2019
Pulp Fiction," Story with almost no structure, but a lot of cohesion
","Quentin Tarantino's magnum opus and a film that inspired countless imitators. A film that is one of those everyone knows intimately, without ever having seen a minute of it. A film where four completely separate tales intertwine as their characters go on about their criminal, immoral lives.To talk about the story or the plot would be foolishness. You cannot really explain it in any meaningful way without spoiling it completely. Besides, you already know approximately how it goes. If, however, you're young enough or hermit enough that you don't know, I can at least try my level best. It opens with two low-end robbers sitting in a diner and talking about their next gig. As they stand up to put their plan into action, we cut to two completely unrelated dudes talking about the differences between fast food product names in different countries. Doesn't sound that riveting, but it strangely is. The two dudes are gangsters. Hit men on their way to lay some vengeance on some unhappy souls.The real genius of the film starts to reveal itself when these stories start to intertwine. Suddenly one of the gangsters meets the boss's wife from another story or the boxer is actually working for the same guy the two gangsters are. The stories are also told out of order, bringing a whole new level of meta knowledge to the viewing experience. One of the best examples of storytelling I've ever seen on film.I also really like the inconsequential scenes. Like the talk about burgers in the beginning or the taxi drive the boxer takes after his last match. The latter scene adds absolutely nothing, except perhaps deepening Butch's character a little bit, but it's such a great scene that I don't want it to be cut away. The taxi driver, Esmeralda, is such a captivating character. Almost like the protagonist of a completely different movie suddenly wanderer into this film. And they're all like that. They don't add a lot to the plot, but they're absolutely necessary for the style, the mood and the texture the film has.Pulp Fiction is a great film. One of my all-time favourites. It's one hundred percent Tarantino and is one of those films you can watch over and over and still find something new you didn't notice before or had already forgotten because the film is so full of details to appreciate. It is violent and gory, and certainly not for the squeamish, but it's also lethally charismatic and suave. Just like a gangster film should be.",Null,0,1,12 January 2016
"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"," Guy Ritchie brings it home
","Ritchie's feature film debut and very similar in themes and outlook to his next film, Snatch. A film about dubious criminals, simple souls, odd happenstances, bloody brutality and tongue-in-cheek crime comedy.The story goes that a group of four friends end up owing money to the biggest, meanest and baddest crime lord in town. To solve this conundrum they decide to rob their next door neighbours, who just happen to be gangsters planning a big heist against a local bunch of weed cultivators. There's also a pair of antique shotguns floating around. Hence the name.Ritchie's signature flair shines through even this early on. The film is full of inventive camera angles, nonchalant character reactions and certain attitude that to me resembles an odd mixture of pro wrestling and 40s pulp adventure. Everyone, and I mean everyone, is a Character with a capital C. Everyone is playing a role, everyone is posturing, yet everyone is at least a bit clueless and oddly sincere in their interactions. It's at the same time ridiculous and utterly endearing.Still, compared to Snatch, this is a lesser film. The plot is nowhere near as snappy, the cinematography doesn't have the reproductive organs to go all the way and for some reason the whole film uses this awful brown filter, which makes the film look like it crawled through the London sewer system.Is it worth a watch? Absolutely! It's just that Snatch pulls it off even better. Watch both if you can, but if you can only watch one, this is not the one.",Null,0,0,24 May 2018
Les Mis√©rables," Imperfect yet powerful adaptation
","Les Mis√©rables is one of those huge stories that are hard to adapt into any other format other than a novel. It spans years and years, following the life of one Jean Valjean, a released prisoner that vows to turn his life around, while at the same time one of the French Revolutions is about to begin. Its themes are massive and not easily explored, given the time constraint. Add the fact that this is not an adaptation of the novel, per se, but rather an adaptation of the world famous musical based on the book. So it's pretty easy to say that the deck was heavily set against this being a good movie.How did it do? Well, I have to be honest and say that it's a heavily flawed film. Not all of the actors are well-suited for singing their lines - though oddly I didn't mind Russell Crowe all that much - the cinematography is way too in love with extreme closeups, the set pieces, while impressive, feel too cramped and the story jumps around, wanting to go over all the relevant plot details, but losing coherence in the process.And despite all that, I was moved to tears by the end of the film. Naturally most of that is due to the strength of the original story, that of a criminal turned saint earning his redemption for his past crimes. But even a masterful story can mean nothing if it's told incorrectly. And that's not the case here. The extreme closeups can be distracting, as can be the singing, but the more the movie goes on, the more you find yourself being pulled in, feeling the emotions of the characters, the despair, the joy. It's a captivating experience, one the best I've seen in years. There were moments where I had to remind myself to breathe.This movie is a rough jewel. It has raw talent to spare, but it loses some of it due to technical imperfections and poor choices. It is worth seeing, but at the same time you have to mourn what it could have been.",Null,0,0,10 March 2015
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2," Comes very close to matching the original
","Sequels are often plagued by sequelitis, which is of course the technical term for the need for a sequel to be almost the exact same thing as the original hit except bigger, faster, stronger and far more outlandish. This film neatly avoids that. Partly because the original already was so outlandish that you can really only go down a notch from there.But, in all honesty, Guardians Vol. 2 works exactly as a sequel should. It continues the story. The Guardians have already met, they are a team, and thus the film is about them working as a team and learning to be a team. It also deepens the characters. We learn a huge deal about all of the returning characters, including the Ravager boss Yondu played by Michael Rooker, hands down my favourite part of the film. But we also learn a lot about Peter (Chris Pratt) and the film's main story is about him learning about his heritage. We'll get to that in a moment.But a good sequel also needs to retain the good parts of the original. And this definitely does. It's just as colourful, just as imaginative, just as laid back and just as much fun as the original. It feels exactly like a Guardians sequel should feel. Sure the novelty is no longer there, but that's the price we inevitably have to pay.And that lack of novelty is really one of two things keeping this from being as good as the original. The other thing being the story. The original story wasn't perfect either, suffering from a weak villain and some various hiccups. But it kept together very nicely and was a genuinely good origins story, especially keeping in mind the size of the cast. In this film the villain starts out much better, but ends on a sour note. The film is also all over the place story-wise. This isn't a huge problem because the characters and the humour are what people come to see, and both of are great, but it still means that it simply doesn't deliver as much of a punch as the original did.Nevertheless, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is one of the best Marvel sequels to day and a great watch for anyone looking for a scifi film that knows how to entertain.",Null,2,5,25 June 2017
In Time," Enjoyable style over substance
","This movie has a promising premise, if nothing else. The idea of using lifetime as currency has been done before, but it's still uncommon enough that the idea enough makes this movie intriguing. And at first the movie treats its premise well. The urban ghetto of those living one day at a time is portrayed well, making you to feel for its citizens. By the time the rich and immortals are introduced, you have begun to understand the blight of those less fortunate, which in turn causes you to side with them. There are some plot holes and questions about how such a economy can function and why don't the people rebel against it, but you'd need at least a full trilogy to fully delve into those questions, so I don't really blame this movie for not fully examining every little nuance about the world it tries to portray. It's full of stuff as it is.So, the start is a promising one? So what goes wrong? Well, it stops examining the world and turns into an action film with car chases, gun battles, mooks, criminals and your basic Robin Hood wannabes. It's still not bad, per se, as most of the actors are rather enjoyable (Justin Timberlake and Amanda Seyfried with those humongous eyes of hers were especially pleasant surprises), the cinematography and the score are both above average and the whole movie manages to look extremely stylish and easy on the eyes. But I would have liked to see more of this world. How it works? How it came to be? Why did it came to be? Some of those questions are hinted at, but never answered, while some of them are not even mentioned. I didn't expect the movie to answer all of the questions, but it should have tried to answer as many as it comfortably could. Now it stops way too early.So, in the end, what did I think of the film? Well, it's intriguing and thought-provoking, yet it falls flat after the first third. It's well-made and enjoyable to watch, but it's also disappointing, there's no denying that. So... if you like scifi thrillers at all, you'll probably enjoy this one just fine. If you want an intellectual film, there's something here for you as well, but don't expect too much. And if you just want a good action film, I'd give this one a watch. It's entertaining all the way through, very much so in fact.",Null,2,4,17 January 2012
Thor," Feels a bit rushed, but otherwise a fine movie
","Thor was always the hardest to introduce into the Marvel Cinematic Universe. While the rest of the Avengers are all human, albeit some with superpowers, Thor, the mythological god of thunder, is anything but. Keeping that in mind, I think this was an excellent adaptation of the comic book superhero that we know and love. It has its flaws, and if you were to write the whole Avengers storyline from a scratch, you'd probably give a character like Thor a miss, but the film makers managed to make it work.What I like the most about this film is its charm. This stems from the great actor choices, as well as the writing and the dialogues. Chris Hemsworth was a new face for me personally, but I don't think that they could have picked a better Thor. The man has it all, the looks, the attitude, the physical prowess, the charisma. Natalia Portman and Tom Hiddleston are equally great in their roles of Jane Foster and Loki, respectively. The writing, on the other hand, shines through in the dialogues, which are fun to follow and feel real. Hemsworth has some really great lines throughout the entire film, which cause me to laugh out loud no matter how many times I see this film.In addition, the rest of the cast do excellent job as well, the visuals (especially the design of Asgard) are topnotch and the action scenes are creative and fun to follow.Unfortunately the movie falters a bit when it comes to the pacing. Most of the first half of the film is spent in Asgard, introducing the world and building up the characters. And while this is all needed and I enjoyed all of it, it causes the time spent on Earth to feel just a little bit rushed, especially the budding romance between Thor and Foster. So perhaps a little more time should have been focused on Earth rather than the various alien worlds, but even as it it, it doesn't ruin the film. There are some things that could have benefited from extra attention (Odin sleep, anyone?), but only the romance really feels like it should have had more time to develop. Otherwise you can buy the fact that the film can only be so long.Aside from that one flaw, I really think that this is a great film. The characters, the visuals, the plot, they all work and they work well. Marvel can proudly call this one its own and it's a worthy introductory film for the character of Thor.",Null,3,4,25 August 2013
Three Colors: Blue," About emotional freedom and learning to cope
","The first film in Krzysztof Kieslowski's Three Colours trilogy, named after the colours of the French flag and loosely themed after the values of French Revolution. With this one obviously named Blue and dealing with the value of freedom.The story follows a young woman, a recently widowed Julie (Juliette Binoche), who lost both her husband and daughter in a car accident. She struggles to cope with this enormous emotional gut punch by distancing herself from her past, from her old life, from her memories. She tries to free herself from her anguish and sorrow.The story is not a bad one and the film is certainly well-acted, but I have to admit that this whole trilogy shines for me because of its technical aspects. The camerawork is superb, the acting is really nice and the locations are evocative. But mainly it's the use of colour. Shocking, I know. This film is so blue, and in a really inventive way that supports the story. Blue is a melancholic colour, it's a deep colour. But it's also a refreshing colour, a cool, calming colour. And that's all reflected in the film.I'd call Blue a good gateway film into more artistic films. It has a plot, it has characters, it has an arc, but a lot of the subtext is only implied and has to reasoned out from the colours, from the score, from the imagery. Not a huge film, but intellectually pleasing nonetheless.",Null,1,2,14 December 2018
The Happening," Boring to the extreme
","So we have a premise where a mysterious disease is spreading throughout the world and we start to follow a group of survivors as they try to save themselves from the spreading destruction. Fair enough, it's another disaster movie with close calls, intense escape situations and general panic and mania amongst mankind. I've seen some good example of this and I'm open to seeing another one.Unfortunately M. Night Shyamalan has no idea how to direct a film such as this one. The start of the film actually isn't that bad and some of the imagery of people losing their minds is actually very effective and creepy, as it should be. But then the film focuses exclusive on Mark Wahlberg and his group of survivors and it becomes so unbelievably dull to watch. All the tension bleeds out of the movie while we're forced to watch his monotone delivery of lines while he strays between his two basic expression, neither of which isn't that emotive or expressive. And I'm not saying that I Wahlberh can't be entertaining. He's decent enough when he's in an action film or something that requires him to actually do something. But in a movie where the actual threat isn't that visible and most of the film's quality has to come from the actors and their ability to convey the feel of danger, he's not your guy. And unfortunately none of the other actors are good enough to pick up the slack.And then there are the sins of Shyamalan. He spends far too much time following these people as they flee aimlessly from one place to another. The threat itself is poorly established, makes no sense and is kind of silly when you stop to think about it. The problem is that this film takes itself far too seriously. Had it even hinted at the possibility that it had been made with some tongue in cheek, it would have been far more tolerable to watch. It's no surprise that this film has been parodied and mocked to the death.Long story short, this is a bad film. It has no direction, no goals, no aim. It's a poor man's attempt to film a horror film without understanding horror at all. The sooner we forget its existence the better.",Null,3,5,26 December 2013
Castle in the Sky," First true Ghibli film and a testament to its talent
","With the success of Nausica√§ of the Valley of the Wind, Hayao Miyazaki and Isao Takahata were able to found Studio Ghibli, and this was their first official feature film. And what a great film it was and still is, having withstood the test of time remarkable well. Inspired by Jonathan Swift's novel Gulliver's Travels, it's a tale about a world that has fallen into ruin after a golden age - a common theme with Miyazaki - and the miracles of yesterday have become legends and myths. Including Laputa, the eponymous castle in the sky. Yet there are still those that search for it.In a lot of ways, this is a very good introduction into films directed by Miyazaki. It's a relatively simple story, yet it keeps you hooked from the very first scene. It's very kid-friendly, but has deeper themes and even a few dark scenes. The characters are both memorable and identifiable. Pretty much all of them are the kind of people you would like to know and have along on an adventure - with the exception of one or two, but we'll get to them in a moment. And it has flying machines, industrial revolution -inspired populations, gorgeous animation, hauntingly beautiful music, great action scenes, all that good stuff.Yet I would still rank this amongst my least favourite Miyazaki films. (And yeah, I'm still giving this a nine out of ten. The man's that good.) The reason for that is the fact I think the villain's a bit weak. The character design isn't all that interesting, he comes off more pathetic than menacing and he's quite honestly a bit creepy in a way that doesn't match the tone the film is going for. Bad vibes, is all I'm saying. Still, his voice actor does a good job and he has a few good scenes, so I can deal with him. The side villains are a bit on the same boat, but they have less screen time, so they end up on the positive side.But as my rating should indicate, I think this is a very good film. Fun, engaging, beautiful - the perfect kid's film that adults can enjoy as well. Studio Ghibli couldn't have started its career with a better film.",Null,1,1,7 January 2014
The Shape of Water," Bizarre adult fairy tale love story
","It's the 60s, the era of Cold War. The Americans are living their dream, while at the same time fearing the nuclear bomb and the Red Threat. Spy game is in full bloom and both of the great nations are vying for technological supremacy. In the midst of this, a most curious specimen arrives at a space research laboratory in Baltimore. A being unlike anything seen by modern science. But curiously it's the mute cleaning woman, who best seems to understand this beastman.Guillermo del Toro has always traveled down his own path. In fact, I'm unsure whether he even knows the main path exists at all. With The Shape of Water he returns back to the genre of adult fairy tales. Quite like his previous film, Pan's Labyrinth. And truth be told, these two films have much in common. Both feature female characters struggling between two worlds, those of myth and reality. In both the myth offers an escape both from the fears and horrors of the real world. In both it's the reality that reveals itself to be the source of true evil.That being said, there are differences. The setting is quite different, changing war-torn Spain for Cold War United States, though both of these locations are treated with a critical and nostalgic touch, although the films don't forget to have a smile every now and then either. And whereas Pan's Labyrinth was told through the eyes of a child protagonist, reflecting and talking about the fears and challenges of childhood, The Shape of Water has as its main character a woman. A sexually frustrated, lonely woman. And the film reflects that quite nicely. It's a risque film in many respects and I doff my hat to del Toro for having the guts to go all the way.It's also a beautifully acted film. Sally Hawkins is marvelous, especially having to play a mute person. Yet her soul is laid bare in front of us and we struggle alongside her through her hardships and victories. Michael Shannon as Colonel Strickland gives a great performance as well and I do feel he was slightly snubbed in not getting an Oscar nomination.If I was forced to choose, I would say Pan's Labyrinth is the better film. But it's a minute difference. The Shape of Water is a beautiful, thoughtful film that shows del Toro to be one of the best storytellers of our time.",Null,84,174,18 February 2018
The Untouchables," A gangster film from the point of view of the law
","The Untouchables is based on a real life crew of lawmen, who fought to put Al Capone behind bars, named for their incorruptibility. Lead by agent Eliot Ness, they arranged raids on known breweries and hidden ale houses, confiscated vast amounts of illegal liquor and tried to pin it all on Capone.The actual story is of course much more complicated than would be practical for a film, but overall this movie is a rather faithful representation of the events that took place and keeps at least with the spirit of what actually happened. Certain characters have been combined to make for a smoother story telling experience. But, nevertheless, it stands on its own as a very interesting and intriguing gangster story, with plenty of atmosphere, Chicago style mood, gunfights, men in fedoras, all that good stuff. It's also very interesting to see the Prohibition Era from the point of view of the law, as the time is often thought to be the golden age of gangsters and thus they're usually the focus of any story.It's also a very professionally made film. Director Bryan De Palma is also known for movies such as Scarface and Mission: Impossible, and this movie showcases his strong points equally as well, from pacing to cinematography to characters. The movie also benefits from the talents of Kevin Costner and Sean Connery as the two main law enforcers. Probably one of my favourite Costner roles, and a good showing from Connery as well. Robert De Niro as Capone leaves me a bit cold. He certainly has the charisma and the presence to pull it off, but unfortunately the movie doesn't focus on him all that much, limiting his influence.Special mention should also be made of the score by Ennio Morricone. Some great tunes here.All in all, The Untouchables is a very good Prohibition Era film. It has all the hallmarks of a classic gangster film, knows how to tell its story and has some real acting talent to pull it off. Certainly worth a watch for all fans of the era and the style.",Null,0,0,6 September 2015
The Fountain," A strong story not told overly well
","It's a damn shame that Darren Aronofsky was forced to cut his budget in half, because I would have loved to see what he could have come up with the original script. Because right now the film feels like it's halfway done. Like certain scenes are missing and that the film didn't reach its full potential.Right now the film is very much love it or hate it. Those film goers, who love deep and thought-provoking films will appreciate the underlying themes and the quiet atmosphere that slowly builds as the story progresses. Others, myself included, will see the fact that the film is not executed correctly. The overall story is a masterpiece, retelling the story of the first man and woman, but unfortunately that said story is not told correctly. The choice to separate the story into three different time periods and locations was a good one, but those three separate stories have to tie together in some way. And the first two time periods actually do feed of each other and they feel connected. But the last time period is there mainly for the gorgeous space imagery and for the trailer shots. Or at least that's the feeling I was left with after I was done watching this movie. There are some minor scenes where the third time period ties together with the first two, but they are few and far between.Thought I must admit that the first two stories are extremely well-done. The love story between these two archetypical characters is believable and eventually even a bit heart-breaking. Both main actors are very talented and they have a genuine chemistry. The cinematography IS damn impressive, special effects are used skillfully and this movie honestly managed to pull me in.Thus, in the end, this movie has an amazing story, but it doesn't manage to convey that story overly well. It's a brilliant movie for those that can appreciate it from a thematic, aesthetic or atmospheric point of view, but it's definitely not for those who demand a coherent, well-told story above all else.",Null,0,3,7 February 2012
Mr. & Mrs. Smith," Weak story, fun characters and dashing actors
","I feel that with a better writing this could have been a good film. The basic idea itself isn't all that intelligent in that a movie based on this idea is never going to revolutionize your way of thinking or how you see the world. But it's a fun little idea with a clever premise that could allow for lots of jokes, humour and action. And we do get some of that. There are some really good scenes when the first starts to drop hints about the professions of its two main characters. On the whole I actually like the first half of this film a lot more than I like the second half. The first just has more good scenes, better humour and more character moments where we are introduced to these people. The second half is almost nothing more than one action scene after another. They're good action scenes, mind you, but the strength of a film almost always lies on its characters and its story, and we don't much of either of those during the second half.Though there are some scenes, where the characters of Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie come to grips with what they have learned about each other and those scenes do work, mostly because the chemistry between Pitt and Jolie is that good. It's always nice to see two big stars sharing a film. Dueling Stars these films are called and I usually like them a lot, because these stars usually have such a strong presence, especially mega stars like Pitt and Jolie - they're famous for a reason - and that presence usually translates to great scenes where they do nothing more than interact with each other and it's still enormously entertaining. We have that here in abundance.On the technical side of things, the visual style of this film looks rather good. I especially like the flashback to the day when the main characters met, with its blazing colours and hot atmosphere. And, as stated, the action scenes are great as well. Nothing groundbreaking, but they're entertaining and feel realistically brutal, although they still add in that necessary touch of 'no way!' grandeur.So, is it a good film? Well... no, it's not. It's a bit below average, if I'm being completely honest. Whether you'll like it or not, depends a lot on your taste in movies. If you're looking for good action and humorous storytelling, then you might very well like this just fine. If you demand deep characters and thoughtful pondering, you're out of luck with this film. It's not for everyone, but I was personally entertained by it. If only had it spent more time with its story.",Null,0,1,21 December 2012
Psycho," Would utterly fail in lesser hands
","One of Alfred Hitchcock's most well-known films. Regarded as one of the very first examples of the slasher genre. Still one of the most beloved thrillers ever made and an all-around classic. The shower scene movie.And yet, if that's all you know the movie from, you're missing a lot. The shower scene was scandalous back in its day, much like the rest of the film in general, but it doesn't encapsulate the film all that well. It happens near the middle of the film and a lot happens after it. Sure, it is the most striking scene in the film, but I would personally put more weight on the overall performances of Anthony Perkins as Norman Bates and Janet Leigh as Marion Crane.With these two powerful actors Hitchcock manages to tell a truly haunting and nerve-wracking story. Because, to be honest, nowadays the movie would be a bit boring and a lot predictable. The viewer is never truly confused as to where the film is going. But in a way that even enhances the experience. Because you can so clearly see why these characters would make these decisions given the amount of information they have.Add in some masterful camerawork, some really insightful use of surroundings and shadows, the two main actors and a one of the creepiest scores ever produced, and you have a masterful film in your hands.A must see film for all fans of horror and still a really, really good experience all around, despite its age.",Null,1,1,3 May 2018
Rosemary's Baby," The horror of childbirth
","One of Roman Polanski's most well-known films and a considered to be a mid-century horror masterpiece. And for a reason. Rosemary's Baby knows exactly how to build horror, tension and how to unsettle and exploit the deepest fears within our collective psyche. Just like The Exorcist five years later, it knows exactly where to strike: our progeny.The directing and the atmosphere are all thanks to Polanski, but a lot of the film's excellence is due to the chillingly good performance from Mia Farrow, playing the role of Rosemary. She's extremely likable and adorable from the very first scene she's in, making the audience cringe that much harder when the eventual horrible things start happening to her. She also portrays the confused terror of not knowing what's going on with her pregnancy extremely well and exactly like a real person would react. Granted, the way she eventually starts to unravel the mystery is a bit coincidental, but that's the fault of the script, and she does her very best to sell it to you.What I also like about the film is that it doesn't take itself one hundred percent seriously. There are some lighter touches and the film freely nods when the plot starts to become a bit over the top. Which it does, especially near the end, but the film's honesty saves a lot. Another thing about the film is that like many movies of its time, it's a bit slow. In horror that works better than in most films because the atmosphere has that much more time to build, but it'd still be very easy to cut fifteen to thirty minutes away without affecting much. It doesn't ruin the film, really, but it's something that's different to modern films.All in all Rosemary's Baby is a strong horror piece that has left a lasting impact on its genre. Definitely worth a watch if you like Polanski's style and/or horror in general.",Null,2,3,27 July 2015
War of the Worlds," Unpleasant and aimless
","War of the Worlds is an impressive movie on many levels. The technical aspects, first of all, everything from visuals to the sound design, are all amazing. Nothing less could be expected from Steven Spielberg. The alien tripods especially are very, very chilling as they walk across the crumpling town.The problems all rise from the story and the characters. It's an unpleasant film to watch, mostly because it plays out more like a disaster film than an alien invasion popcorn film. And yes, it's clear that Spielberg intentionally meant it to be that way. Doesn't make it the right choice, though, at least in my books. Especially because even in a disaster movie you still usually finish on an uplifting note, all of humanity coming together to rebuild. Here the ending is, while not exactly dark, at least depressing. It's a message of meaningless suffering and the unpredictable cruelty of future and fate. I'm not surprised that so many people see terrorism allegories in this film, but the thing is, if you want to tell such a story, don't tell it in a way that makes us expect a popcorn film.The actors and characters are also rather nondescript. You don't really end up rooting for any of them. The one that comes closest to resembling a sympathetic character is the little girl, played by Dakota Fanning, with her adorable hat fetish, but even she is rather boring and annoying most of the time. Tom Cruise is not bad, actually, but the script forces him to be something of a jerk, which has never worked out for him, mostly because it suits him just a bit too well.War of the World fails as a movie because it's nowhere near entertaining enough to work as a popcorn film, but neither it has enough depth to make you think. You'll get something out of it for its production values, but they're not enough to justify its flaws. One of Spielberg's weakest, I'm afraid.",Null,1,6,9 April 2015
Hercules," Somewhat flawed and superfluous, but still has that Disney spark of magic
","Disney's Hercules is an odd mix of elements. It takes Ancient Greek mythology, completely twists it around while still retaining enough to keep it recognizable, adds painfully bright pastel colour palette, throws in some CGI and simpering sidekicks, and crowns it all off with a soundtrack that takes all of its inspiration from American gospel music. Interesting choices, if nothing else.Now, some of that I'm completely okay with. I don't really care that there are only five muses, instead of nine like there are in the original mythology. I don't think nine would have been too much, seeing that they're usually the ones singing and gospel music is well-equipped to large crowds singing it, but it's okay. Though it is a bit strange that they dropped Euterpe, the muse of song and music (and elegiac poetry), from the lineup. The use of CGI is also a bit jarring nowadays, because it hasn't aged that well, but I can see that they wanted to experiment with a new technology. Disney has always done that, though usually with better results. What is a bit harder for me to understand is the fact that they made Hades the villain instead of Hera, who was Hercules's main nemesis in the original myths, seeing as she was jealous that her husband Zeus had slept with a mortal woman, siring Hercules in the process. Or Heracles, as he should be called, because this is the Greek version of the myth. Then again, Disney is all about family values, so it's not that surprising. And James Woods does brilliant as the voice actor of Hades.What really keeps me from liking this film more is the main hero, unfortunately. Hercules just isn't all that interesting of a guy, especially when compared to the ones that came just before him. Simba, Belle, Aladdin, Quasimodo, all of these deep, tragic main characters. And yeah, Hercules has his problems, but he still comes across as that perfect high school jock. You know, the nice one, who could have starred in any breakfast cereal commercial he wanted, was the homecoming king, went on to have a successful career in sports, founded a perfect family and died at the age of one hundred, surrounded by grandkids. You have nothing against the guy, but you're also not really all that interested in the details of his life.Then again, Megara is great, Hades is excellent, Zeus is enjoyably over the top and boisterous, Phil and Pegasus are alright and the rest of the cast do their jobs. The animation is also very nice, though personally I'm not a fan of the colour palette, but that's a pet peeve of mine and not a fault of the film in any way. And while the songs and the music style are not outright classics like so many other Disney soundtracks of the 90s, there are some decent songs in the mix. Though couldn't you have given Hades a villain song? It would have been glorious.Ultimately Hercules is one of the weaker Renaissance films, but still lands somewhere in the middle as far as the overall quality of Disney films is to be considered. It has its flaws, but is still an enjoyable experience for kids and adults alike. Give it a try if you haven't already.",Null,1,3,15 November 2015
Love Actually," Horrible morals, terrible execution, misused cast
","Love Actually is a collage of stories centering around people living their intertwining lives in the weeks leading up to Christmas. It's also something of a Who's Who of British acting at the time of its release. Almost every single British actor worth note is in this pile of droppings. Power of Christmas, I suppose, for I see no other reason for them to debase themselves like this.So what exactly is wrong with this film? Well, the few upsides first. It is a nice looking film. The locations are nice, the stories are varied, some even interesting, and it has that Yuletide feel to it. And the actors are talented. There are some truly nice scenes and good character moments. But that's because the actors are so good, not because the script is worth anything.And the stories are terrible. Some are merely bland, like the one containing Bill Nighy and Gregor Fisher. Some are just wrong, but in a funny way, like the one with Kris Marshall. But the vast majority of them are more than a bit cringe-worthy. We have over-sexualized prepubescents, a best man wooing after the bride, an adulterer, an import bride and far far too many dudes lusting after women based solely on their looks. And this is supposed to be a Christmas movie about the concept of love. Give me a break!The only decent story, where I actually bought the chemistry and thought it kind of sweet, was the one containing Martin Freeman and Joanna Page. And their characters are porn stunt doubles. That should tell you something about this film.",Null,9,15,6 January 2018
12 Years a Slave," Powerhouse
","One review I read about this film praised it for being one of, if not the first film to portray slavery solely from the point of view of a slave. Not sure if that's true, but it sums up the tone and style of the film rather nicely. We're all aware that slavery existed in US and that it still exists in other parts of the world, but because history is largely written by the victors, most accounts of slavery come from the point of view of Caucasians. So, to base your film on one of the most influential accounts of slavery as written by an actual slave, was a somewhat risky, but important choice.And what we end up getting is one of the most poignant and emotional films in recent memory. 12 Years a Slave is not afraid of its subject matter. It's a faithful representation of actual events and none of the ugliness is hidden or downplayed. It's a horrifying journey through years of misery, lost hopes, suffering and pain. Yet it never falls into despair, it doesn't alienate its viewers with needless gore or cruelty like an exploitation film might do.The film's quality is only increased by some haunting acting jobs pulled off by the cast. Chiwetel Ejiofor especially is an amazing leading man as Soloman Northup and I must admit I'm somewhat disappointed that he didn't receive an Oscar for his efforts. He would have more than earned it. But to be fair, the rest of them are very talented as well and Lupita Nyong'o's Oscar was well-earned. But it's Ejiofor's performance we spend the most time with and there isn't a single scene where he doesn't absolutely sell it, with his heart and soul.Steve McQueen's directing is also at the foreground. He follows Solomon's journey slowly and methodically, allowing for the slow scenes to go on as needed, lingering just long enough for the full impact to sink in. There's a certain feeling of art film in the long scenes of scenery and soft music, but it never feels unwarranted. The cut to the Southern nature, following an intense, blood-chilling scene of unimaginable cruelty, always comes as a chance to pull in and reflect.12 Years a Slave was named the Best Picture of 2013. And for the first time in years I'm one hundred percent behind that decision. This is an important film that will remain with us for years to come. But perhaps more importantly it's a masterwork of film making. Achingly beautiful, horrifying, depressing and uplifting all at the same time. Owe it to yourself to see it.",Null,3,5,20 March 2014
Joker," Long, detailed spiral into madness
","Joker, starring Joaquin Phoenix in the titular role, is the origin story of the infamous Batman arch nemesis , taking place in Gotham in the 80s. Arthur Fleck (Phoenix) is a man deep into mental health issues. He suffers from uncontrollable bouts of laughter, has deep-rooted self-confidence issues and is currently living in a city just on the brink of disaster. Not helping the matters is his situation as a life-in caretaker for his demented mother, and his dead-end job as a clown-for-hire. And then he gets that little push, to quote another Batman movie.What Joker is, beneath all the layers, is a never-ending spiral into insanity, madness and ruin. Whenever you think that there's a ray of hope, of sunshine, the movie pulls the rug underneath your feet. Whenever you start to feel any sympathy for Arthur, he does something heinous or ups the ante. Whenever you think you have found someone to root for in this film, they reveal an ugly side to their persona.And yet the movie has levity to it. As befitting the character. It's a horrible, depressing film, but it does get a chuckle out of you. Which makes everything that follows even more depressing. Which is the Joker, in a nutshell.Furthermore, it's absolutely gorgeously filmed, the dialogues are great, the characters have real bite to them, the 80s Gotham is fantastically realized and it's just topnotch film making all around.If I had to nitpick, I would say that the film didn't necessarily need the inclusion of Bruce Wayne into it. It doesn't ruin the narrative, but it also felt just a bit tacked on, truth be told. Still, a minor gripe at best.Very good film. Nolan's The Dark Knight is still a better Batman film, as far as I'm concerned, but this film is a contender.",Null,1,2,18 November 2019
To Kill a Mockingbird," If only everyone would see and understand this film
","Based on a book of the same name by Harper Lee, To Kill a Mockingbird takes place in Alabama in the 1930s. It centers around two young protagonists, Scout (Mary Badham) and Jem (Phillip Alford), but it's really the story about their father's, Atticus Finch's (Gregory Peck), struggle to prove the innocence of a black man accused of rape and assault. And this during times when to even suggest such a thing was almost unthinkable.I admire how the story is told. It's a heavy theme to explore. To state that all people should be seen as equals, especially in the eyes of the law, which should stand above as all. To hold to your conviction, even in the face of universal spite and mockery. But to further the exploration, we view this question and dilemma through the eyes of children. And all of a sudden the issue becomes quite simple indeed. Difficult to achieve in practice, but simple in principle. And we're left wondering alongside the children, why is it so hard for everyone?There are some side stories, dealing with the children's lives and adventures around the neighbourhood, but the courtroom drama is the heart of the film and the one thing everyone knows it by. Although I do think that the final scene, which gives the film its name, is also very nice and poignant, even though it doesn't necessarily have all that much to do with the courtroom case. Thematically, certainly, but otherwise not so much.Aside from that, it's a nice film all around. The child actors are surprisingly talented and Peck is magnificent as an uncompromising and fully moral attorney father. It's also shot well, told well, scripted well and even though its pace is rather measured and even slow, you're not going to be bored during any single minute.Definitely one of the classics for a reason.",Null,0,1,24 June 2016
The Bridge on the River Kwai," The battle of will between two monolithic soldiers of war
","Director David Lean's earlier war movie, this one taking place in the jungles of Burma. A group of British soldiers have been captured by the Japanese, but their commanding officer, Lieutenant Colonel Nicholson (Alec Guinness), instantly clashes with the camp commander, Colonel Saito (Sessue Hayakawa), who he sees trying to undermine the rules of war by forcing the officers into manual labour alongside their men. Whereas Saito sees Nicholson as a traitor to the rules of war for having surrendered alive. Also, soon after the British have arrived, an American soldier named Shears (William Holden) manages to escape.Lean takes us on a long journey in this film. The duality of war's conventions and rules being put against the sheer savagery of it is examined through the characters of Nicholson and Saito - and to a lesser degree Shears and the company he keeps. War is horrendous and oftentimes meaningless, but quite often men try to deal with this by forcing artificial rules onto it. Rules, which become so precious to them, that they cannot adapt them or operate outside of them. And in a way this is just as horrendous and meaningless.This film lives by its grand scope and the talent of its actors. And luckily both of those work very well. Guinness is hands down the most memorable performance and the one that embodies the themes of the movie the best, but the rest of the cast is also very good. The film is also shot beautifully, with some great scenes and sets included.The Bridge on the River Kwai doesn't quite live up to the grandeur of Lawrence of Arabia, but it is still a fine piece of war cinema and well worth a watch for all interested.",Null,0,1,26 June 2017
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," Sometimes a movie just works
","I've always had slight problems with this film. I've seen it every now and then throughout my years. I've heard how good it is. And I can see that for myself. It is a good film. But why?Well... it did win the Big Five of Oscars. Best Film, Director, Screenplay and both Main Actors. Only the second film to have ever done that. And yeah, I guess there's something there. Everything in this film simply works. And it works very well together. Jack Nicholson as the chaotic McMurphy and Louise Fletcher as nurse Ratched, who controls the mental ward with an iron fist, are both phenomenal in their roles. Nicholson is of course Jack Nicholson, but Fletcher's role, especially right next to Nicholson's, also must be praised. You're constantly being kept wondering whether her efforts to force the patients into an iron tight, rigid order are because that's what she believes will help them or is it just because she truly doesn't care and simply wants everything to go exactly like she prefers.It's also a really professional-looking film. Cinemacraft at its finest. Although, I have to admit that 60s mental hospital is not exactly the most exciting of locations, but then it's a character movie anyway. The score is also atmospheric and moody in just the right way. The opening shot alone instantly sets the pace.I guess sometimes you just have to admit that you don't know something. I'm still not sure exactly why this film works. I just know that it does.",Null,0,0,23 February 2018
Edge of Tomorrow," Pleasant surprise
","I wasn't terribly interested in this film when I first saw the trailers. Tom Cruise hadn't managed to convince me as an action star in years and even Emily Blunt couldn't raise my interest. But, eventually I ended up seeing it on DVD and I must admit that I should have gone and seen this in the movies.We've seen plenty of these 'groundhog day' type movies where time repeats itself and only a single man is aware of it. The trick in these movies is to show the same thing again and again while still keeping it interesting by changing how the protagonist goes around trying to alter the flow of circumstances. And this movie pulls it off beautifully. It keeps it pace and editing so quick and smooth that you always feel like things are moving forward, while they're quite literally not.Cruise and Blunt were also another pleasant surprise, Cruise especially. Perhaps it's because this time Cruise doesn't try to play a born badass, which he no longer can pull off as convincingly as he did in his glory days. Rather he plays a media officer, who gets thrust into the middle of combat by a bad decision. Furthermore, he and Blunt have good chemistry together and it's nice to see a grizzled female war veteran instead of the usual fare.Saying anything more would spoil the movie needlessly. Trust me when I say that its thoroughly entertaining experience and well worth watching for all fans of science fiction and action movies.",Null,0,2,12 November 2014
Downfall," Chilling
","April 1945. The Allies are marching towards Berlin. Within his hidden, reinforced bunker, Adolf Hitler celebrates his 56th birthday. A few days later he will commit suicide, heralding the end of World War Two. This is the story of those few days, largely based on the memoirs of Traudl Junge, Hitler's personal secretary.A provocative subject, if nothing else. Especially because it takes the bold step to portray Hitler as a human being. A horrible, twisted and utterly racist human being, who has been given way too much power. But a human being, nonetheless. A point of view that is much rarer than you'd think. It's actually a common joke that the first thing you should do with a time machine is to go and prevent Hitler from being born. Yet at the same time it is a widely accepted theory that Germany would have rebelled and started another war even without this one man from Austria-Hungary. Perhaps it would not have been such a large war, and it's quite likely that the Jews would not have suffered so greatly. But Europe would have bled.Still, even this Hitler is very much a caricature . Bruno Granz plays him in a way that to me speaks of wanting to distance himself from the character. His Hitler is a ruin. A stuttering, shaking shell of a man, human only in form. Granted, this has some basis in reality, based on multiple accounts of those final days in the bunker. Still, this Hitler would be a pitiful sight, if he wasn't who he is.And perhaps that's the point. Hitler's evils were horrible and devastating in nature, but they weren't the result of some outside force, cosmic imbalance or anything else like that. We're not given that comfort. Rather they were the result of human nature. Which is a bitter truth to swallow, but a necessary one.An interesting movie and recommended for fans of war and period films. High production values, good acting, tense atmosphere and a subject matter that isn't examined that often.",Null,0,0,26 June 2018
Whiplash," A movie all about music for those that understand it
","A budding jazz pianist (Miles Teller) is admitted into the prestigious Shaffer Conservatory where he comes under the eye of the legendary Terence Fletcher (J. K. Simmons), who promptly starts driving him like a dog, trying to take him as far beyond his human limits as possible.Frankly speaking, movies about music have never been my thing. I'm in no way musically talented or inclined, and thus whenever, for example, there's that one scene where someone has to play something over and over again, getting yelled at the same time to get it right, until it finally goes, it just doesn't open up to me. Every single take sounds the same. Might be that that's the purpose, but I do believe that you're meant to hear the subtle differences if you're good enough.And in that regard I don't think Whiplash has what it takes to take someone on a journey into the world of music. A movie about war, for example, can show you what it would be like to be there on the battlefield. But then that's explicitly what it is trying to do. Whereas Whiplash seems to be about music made by those that get it to those that also get it.Luckily music is only half of the movie. The second big theme is greatness and what is needed to achieve it. Because it cannot be just about raw talent. Every day a person is born with the capability to become a great musician. But few of them end up in the business and only a few of those have the drive needed to urge them onward even when they've already achieved some measure of success.Whiplash is a fine film. Personally I didn't find it as compelling as it probably is to so many others, but I can definitely recognize talent, heart and soul when I see it.",Null,0,0,21 January 2018
The Wolf of Wall Street," Study on Excessivity
","The Wolf of Wall Street is a superb movie on a professional level. The actors, topnotch. The visuals, magnificent. The pacing, incredibly long as the movie is, flawless. The music, great. The costuming, great. The script, great. It's an all-around proof that Martin Scorsese knows what he's doing.It's also a surprisingly easy movie to follow and keep up with, given that it is three hours long. A lot of this is due to Leonardo DiCaprio, whose sheer sleazy charisma fills and steals every scene he's in. And he's in most of them. It's also surprising how identifiable he can make his character, even though the sole purpose in Jordan Belfort's life is to convince other people to hand over their money to him and then do drugs and hookers. That's it, no redeeming qualities whatsoever, but somehow DiCaprio makes you understand what drives this man to be like that. It's certainly not pleasant to watch to world through Belfort's eyes, but it's fascinating.Though it must be admitted that really the only flaw in the movie is the fact that Belfort apparently has no soul. Making the bad guys look identifiable and even admirable is a common theme in Scorsese's movies, but whereas in, say, Goodfellas, the gangsters are at least somewhat loyal to each other and function according to a code of loose honour, Belfort is just a straight cesspool of filth. A well-groomed and dangerously charismatic cesspool, but the fact remains. It is absolutely intentional, I'm sure of it, but it keeps the movie from being as great as Goodfellas, for example. At least in my opinion.Still, a magnificent film from a master of visual media. Easily worth watching.",Null,1,3,11 November 2014
Con Air," It's so 90s, but in the best way possible
","Nicolas Cage plays Cameron Poe, a former US Army Ranger, who has been locked up behind bars for years after he accidentally killed a man while defending his wife. But now he's about to be freed. There's only the last remaining prisoner transport flight left. What could go wrong?The whole idea of Con Air is ludicrous. You have all these over the top bad guys in one airplane. Each of them almost worthy of joining Batman's Rogues Gallery. And then you have the one good guy, who just happens to be there by pure luck and it's up to him to save the day. But you know what, it works. Perhaps I'm more forgiving because it is from the 90s or perhaps they simply knew how to make these plots work back then. Nevertheless, in Con Air the ludicrous tone is a source of strength, not a hindrance.Especially when it comes to John Malkovich. He plays a character named Cyrus the Virus. What a great name and what a great performance. It shouldn't work. This sleazy, smarmy, snobbish piece of over-articulating rhetoric shouldn't work. But in Malkovich's hands it just flows so naturally. Because it's Malkovich.I also like Cage's odd accent. I like Steve Buscemi's completely nonsensical and distracting character performance. I like the clich√©dness of John Cusack and Colm Meaney's characters. I like the stunts.What I don't like is the completely unnecessary fourth act after one of the best ending action scenes I've seen in a while. But that's about the only flaw the film has.Con Air is pure 90s macho popcorn entertainment. Kick back and enjoy.",Null,0,0,25 February 2020
Dark Shadows," Somewhat boring and unfocused
","The thing about Johnny Depp and Tim Burton is that both of them are rather brilliant in their own right. They have a lot of talent, are very creative and they have made some seriously good films during their time in the business. It's just that their collaborations are starting to feel a bit stale. And I don't really blame Johnny Depp in this case, because even though his performance in this movie is not on par with his usual flair, he's still somewhat entertaining and unique. Rather I blame Tim Burton for not even trying. Because that's the key fault with this movie: it's lazy, uninteresting and unfocused.Let's start with the plot, which is all over the place. The basic premise is that an ancient vampire wakes up in the 70s to find his family line in ruins, his manor about to crumple into dust and his worst enemy leading a rival company against his own factory. Fair enough, this is interesting and would allow for a lot of humour or dark drama. However, Burton should have picked one of these approaches and stuck with it. Instead he chose to go with both, which doesn't work at all. Sometimes you can mix emotional drama and humour together, but in this case it's a case of lowest common denominator humour mixed with angst. The case isn't really helped by the subpar actors, who are either completely wooden in their performances (anyone other than the main stars) or try to be both funny and dramatic at the same time (the main stars).Furthermore, the story isn't focused enough and in the end leaves much too many questions unanswered. For example, at the beginning we are introduced to the love interest of the film, played by Bella Heathcote, and we spend a lot of time with her, getting to know how she acts and what makes her tick. And we think, okay, this chick is going to be Barnabas' (Johnny Depp) main lady, his foil and love interest in the same package. But when Depp's character is introduced we never she her again except in very brief scenes that feel rushed and forced, like they tried to fool us into thinking that these two are developing their chemistry, even though they're not. And then the character suddenly returns at the end of the film when it's time for Barnabas to get his girl. And I ask: how do you make that mistake, Tim Burton? That's basic film making 101. The love interest needs to be within the movie, she needs to interact with the protagonist with more than four lines of dialogue. Add in the bizarre twists during the final confrontation with Barnabas' rival and the nonsensical subplot with the father and you have a plot that makes no sense, has no coherence whatsoever and is quite frankly rather boring.So the drama doesn't work. What about the humour? Unfortunately it's rather boring as well. I remember having smiled or smirked once or twice when Johnny Depp's character deadpanned something or the other, but I think that it was more because I sort of forced myself to laugh at him rather than because he was actually funny. And the rest of the characters aren't any better. Watch the trailer if you want to get most of the best jokes. And I use the term best loosely.And finally, the usual best part of Burton's films: the visuals. Well, they actually weren't that bad. The colour palette was a bit grey and colorless, plus Johnny Depp still looked rather well-kept even though he himself has stated that they tried to make him unappealing. (A hint: This is Johnny Depp we're talking about, more effort than an oily haircut is required.) But otherwise the movie looks just fine. Not Burton's best movie in that regard by far, but it could have been worse. And some of the visuals jokes were actually somewhat creative.So yeah, don't go see this film, it's not worth it. Let Tim Burton learn that we have had enough. He needs to step up his game, stop relying on the same old tricks and do something new. The old formula hasn't worked in his favour for some time now and this is the final proof of that. It's a mess and has very little value to anyone. It's not horrible to watch, per se, but it's very, very disappointing.",Null,2,4,15 June 2012
Kong: Skull Island," Fun pulpy rock-n-roll adventure
","Vietnam War is nearing its end and the US forces are slowly withdrawing from the Pacific. But then a satellite reveals an uncharted island, surrounded by eternal storms and hazardous waters. An island shaped like a skull.Kong: Skull Island is just about what it needs to be. What I mean by that is that it is honest. It is a trashy B-flick straight from the pages of pulp magazines. It has it all, from Vietnam War filled with bloodhungry soldiers to giant apes to dinosaurs to a tribe of painted savages to primordial monsters. It has a jaunty soundtrack, some cool special effects, one-liners, gory deaths and enough action scenes to make your blood pressure shoot for the stratosphere.And if you can go in with those kinds of expectations, it's exactly the film you're looking for. But if you go in looking for anything else, you'll end up leaving disappointed. Because while this film has some big names, from Samuel L. Jackson to Tom Hiddleston, it is not a well-acted film. Not at all. Sure Jackson and Hiddleston are probably two of the most entertaining performances, but even they cannot forge diamonds out of something like this. And they shouldn't need to.Furthermore, the monsters. aside from Kong, have really lazy designs, the natives are just a bit cringy and there are perhaps one or two too many characters for the maximum effectiveness and screen-time.Still, I did like it. Is it trash? Most certainly, but it is entertaining trash with great style and enough tongue-in-cheek to make it forgivable. Recommended for all fans of the pulp genre.",Null,0,1,15 December 2018
The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies," It works, but that's about it
","Once again we return to Middle-Earth, this time to bid our farewells for now. The final Hobbit film improves upon the its immediate predecessor by focusing on the battle scenes and leaving much of the silliness out, but by now we've grown weary of the formula and this film doesn't quite reach the atmosphere and mood of the first Hobbit film, let alone the grandeur of The Lord of the Rings trilogy.I truly think Peter Jackson tried too hard to reach the golden middle road with this trilogy. This final installment being no exception. We do get the grand battles and splendid visuals that appeal to the fans of the original trilogy, but we also get dwarfs riding battle boars and speaking with funny Scottish accents, which probably appeals to those that liked he lighthearted tone of the original book. The first film managed to juggle these two contrasting tones, at least as long as the story stayed in Shire, where there is a place for lightheartedness yet somber conversations can happen by the fire. But now Erebor has been retaken and war is brewing on the horizon. I don't think we need battle boars or Legolas doing stunts that would be more at home in an anime. And yes, The Return of the King had similar problems, which is why it's the weakest of the original trilogy. But it didn't do it to this extent.That being said, this is substantially less ridiculous than The Desolation of Smaug, which is a huge plus in the movie's favour. When it's time for battle, the battles are suitably epic and great to look at. And when the characters need to be serious, they can be and you feel bad because the odds are stacked heavily against them. I'm also grateful that Jackson decided to stick to the original ending. I sort of knew he wouldn't be that much a sellout, but the second movie had seriously shaken my resolve. Sorry for doubting you, Peter.I also still like the additions from Tolkien's other works, such as Unfinished Tales, dealing with the White Council. They're cinematic beyond all believe and neatly tie the two trilogies together. No complaints from me, though I know some people don't like them at all.As a whole I'm glad this movie and the whole trilogy exist. They're still great films and they suffer only by being compared to the original trilogy, which has become one of the cornerstones of fantasy film genre. The Hobbit films have their flaws, but it's still Middle-Earth and I'd watch these over most other films there are.",Null,1,3,10 March 2015
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Kind of like Star Wars, but too much
","The Clone War approaches its end as Anakin Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi close in on Count Dooku and his nefarious sith master. Meanwhile, back at Coruscant, the political landscape is about to change as people elect to give more and more power to Supreme Chancellor Palpatine. And in the midst of all this the Jedi Order must plot its course.Episode III was always going to be a huge movie. This was the turning point in the story, the beginning of the Galactic Empire, the foundation for the original trilogy. The first two films in the prequel trilogy had shown us a galaxy so vastly different from the one we'd seen before that we knew something massive was about to happen. And the movie doesn't disappoint. The story has been slowly building during the course of two movies and now we finally get to see the Emperor rise into power, the birth of Darth Vader, all that good stuff.Unfortunately we still have to deal with the unconvincing romance between Anakin (Hayden Christensen) and Padm√© (Natalie Portman). They are better than they were in the first film, having some genuinely good moments and some actual chemistry, but most of their scenes are still easily the weakest in the whole film. The movie is also in quite a hurry, having to cover a lot of ground in relatively short amount of time. Which makes certain scenes, some huge, important ones even, seem extremely rushed and almost glanced over.But, there's also a lot of good stuff. Ewan McGregor and Ian McDiarmid are still absolutely fantastic as Obi-Wan Kenobi and Palpatine, respectively. Samuel L. Jackson also gets a few good scenes in this one. The special effects are great, the movie has some of the best fights in the whole trilogy and as a whole the film seems to be a lot more polished than its predecessor. And when it needs to be huge, it does that very well. In certain scenes perhaps a bit too well, even, seeing as the final fight is absolutely ridiculous and over the top. I know that a lot of people like it, but for me it was a bit too much.Nevertheless, a good film, though a flawed one. For me the best film in the prequel trilogy is still the first one, seeing as it captured the spirit of the originals the best, but this one is a good film to carry you over to the originals in terms of story.",Null,1,1,23 November 2015
Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs," The start of something wonderful
","Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs is one of the most influential films in history. The first full-length animated film, for a few brief years the highest-grossing film of all time and still to this day one of the most successful films in Disney history. Still the most successful if you account for inflation. And there is a reason for all that success, and not just the fact that it was the first. It's the crown of Walt Disney Studios. There might be gems that shined brighter later on, but this is the base, the foundation of the studio's brilliance.And no, it's not a perfect film. You can still see that the animators were still learning away from the brief animated shorts they were more used to doing. The whole film is very episodic, with most of the time spent on general gallivanting and merriment. Especially with the dwarfs. There's a whole segment dedicated to them washing their hands. Actually, I lie. There's a whole segment AND a song dedicated to it. And sure, the dwarfs are great character, each a unique personality with hiccups and all, so the viewer doesn't really mind that the plot is pretty much forgotten much of the time, but you can nevertheless see that it's a work in progress as far as feature length storytelling is concerned.Luckily we have the Queen. And oh, what a way to introduce us to Disney villains. To this day she's one of the greats and it can be argued that the movie is actually about her, not Snow White nor the dwarfs. She's the first character we see, has pretty much the most dialogue and her scenes are the most captivating and actually move the plot forward. And she's a menace. Always plotting, scheming, cackling, being absolutely terrifying. The first look she gives us after her transformation is one of the scariest looks in cinema history.You've all seen this movie already. It's one of the most well-known pieces of art there is and has absolutely held up its charm to this day. Not the best film Disney has ever done, but for their first, it's unbelievable.",Null,1,1,30 May 2015
The Lion King," One of the finest, by any standard you care to set
","By the year 1994, The Walt Disney Animation Studio had been split in two. The A-team was working on Pocahontas, which was supposed to be their ultimate magnum opus, their new Sleeping Beauty, which would set the standard for animated movie greatness. Whereas the B-team was working on The Lion King, to give the audiences something to tide them over until Pocahontas would sweep them off their feet.It's funny how these things work out sometimes. How blind people can be to their own work.Because The Lion King was huge when it came out. It was a cultural phenomenon equally as groundbreaking as Jurassic Park a year earlier, and Disney would have to wait almost two decades until Frozen came along to achieve the same kind of wall to wall cultural hype that followed this movie from day one. And you know what? It earned that hype and recognition. It is a masterpiece, one of those perfect films that populate people's top lists. And it doesn't earn that through harsh themes, dark characters and cold, realistic truths about the human condition. It has those, being one of the most mature Disney films ever made, but at its core it's a movie about triumph, about accepting responsibility, about the fact that it's okay to be afraid, shocked and ashamed, but that at some point you have to¬Ö well, let it go.It's also one of the most colourful Disney films, with an amazing cast of identifiable, likable and instantly recognizable characters. All of its songs are born classics, the sound design in general is phenomenal, as is the voice acting. The story flows seamlessly and goes to some pretty dark places for an animated family film, but it never feels like it's unfair or doing it for the wrong reasons. It has dark scenes and themes because at some point kids need learn about them, and this is the perfect film to teach them.The Lion King is my favourite Disney film. Has always been. It taught me that what I did or, even more importantly, didn't do affected not just me but all those around me. It taught me that those around me affect me as well and I should be respectful of the fact, of those connections. It taught me about bravery, friendship and family. It taught me that sometime truths can be used to manipulate people and that sometimes a lie is the sweetest truth there is. It is an important part of who I am today, and because of that it has my respect and love.",Null,1,1,31 October 2015
Inception," Masterful filmmaking
","To me one of the marks of a great film is that I can watch it again and again and always find something new, something that I missed the last time or something that I had forgotten, but which I now saw again and learned to appreciate it even more. I have that here, with Inception. People also often use the word tight to describe a great film. Tight as in everything seems to fit together, the details support one another and the film feels like a lot of thought has been put into it. I have that with Inception.Is the movie perfect, though? No, because no movie really is. There are some minor plot points that don't really add up and there are some really vocal people out there that complain about the rules of the dreaming. Some claim that there shouldn't be any rules, some claim that the rules make no sense. I especially despise the former ones. I liked that Christopher Nolan tried to establish clearly set rules into the dreaming. These rules give us purpose, they allow us to form expectations, they allow us to speculate, to discuss the details of what we have just seen. So I don't really understand what these people are trying to accomplish when they claim that there shouldn't be any rules. Perhaps they think that randomness equals art and were expecting this film to be one big explosion of crazy imagery and drug-induced madness. I don't know, I just like forming theories, for which I require rules.Nevertheless, whether you agree with the form of dreaming that this film has, it's a great film. And not just because of the complex and rather unique story, but also because it has an ensemble cast, rich and detailed characters, imaginative imagery and an ending that's still the only one that has earned a standing ovation from the crowd. Well, the only one that I've ever seen.To whom I might recommend this film? To everyone, frankly speaking. The film is so multilayered, so complex in design and execution, that I can't really think of a person that wouldn't enjoy at least some part of it. One of the greatest scifi movies there is and one of my personal favourites of all time.",Null,4,8,5 October 2012
Sherlock Holmes," Interesting and entertaining adaptation
","A mark of great characters is their versatility. There have been many iterations of Sherlock Holmes, many of them quite different from one another. Yet most of them feel true to the character, because Arthur Conan Doyle wrote him to have enough depth for such variations. Sherlock Holmes can be calm, deductive and collective. He can be passionate, intuitive and more than a bit crazy. He can be loving, he can be cruel, he can be unpredictable and if handled with care, it'll all feel true.Guy Ritchie's take on the character, as realized by Robert Downey Jr., falls on the more eccentric end of the scale. His Holmes accentuates the madness of the character, the razor sharp edge between lunacy and genius. Yet he's never out of the line. There's reason to his madness and when he suddenly sobers up and functions with frightening purpose, it doesn't feel out of place. Beautiful performance by Downey and the utmost reason why this film works so well.Though I feel I must praise Jude Law's take on Dr. Watson as well. His is a more subtle performance and whenever he shares screen time with Downey, he recedes to his superior presence. But that's the essence of Watson, so it feels quite fitting. I also really enjoyed his sarcasm and tired frustration. A nicer and more civilized Watson would have felt out of place next to Downey, but with Law they manage to strike the perfect balance.Furthermore, it's an excellent film on the technical side of things. The soundtrack is superb, the set and clothing designs are marvelous, the action scenes have suitable weight behind them and as a whole the story is paced nicely. The plot itself isn't anything spectacular, but this is a movie you're going to see for the experience, not because it has something meaningful to say.Are you a fan of action mystery stories with glib sense of humour, charismatic acting and excellent production values? Then I'd suggest giving this one a chance.",Null,0,2,21 April 2014
WALL¬∑E," Captivating, sweet and memorable
","WALL¬∑E still reigns as one of Pixar's finest films and a true testaments to the fact that you don't necessary need an overabundance of witty dialogue to tell your story. The first half of this film is practically silent, with perhaps a few lines of dialogue on the background to set the mood or to allude to the premise.The Earth has become inhospitable to human life due to our own poor choices. Mountains of garbage have buried our once great cities and we have left our home planet behind to reach for the stars. But, we've left some robots behind to clean up this mess. And one of their last remaining members is the movie's titular character, WALL¬∑E. He's quite happy pursuing his craft, until he meets another robot, a sleeker and deadlier specimen, named EVE.What a fantastic premise and what a fantastic way to tell it. We learn everything we need to know about WALL¬∑E without a single line of dialogue from him. Well, okay, he says his own name every now and then, and he definitely makes sounds, but they're more like bleeps and whistles. But that's all we need. His design is so amazingly expressive, so emotive, that we buy the soul behind his programming and code. His romantic spirit.That being said, if the first half of this movie is an easy A+ of storytelling, with an honourable commendation thrown in for extra measure, the latter half floats around something like a B-. Still pretty good, but it loses something when it introduces humans back into the story. When it becomes a conflict. It's still quite good, but there was uniqueness to the story before that, which I found myself missing.Still, WALL¬∑E and EVE remain adorable throughout the entire film, it is extremely nicely animated and the message throughout the entire film is very good. It remains one of my favourite Pixar movies of all time and WALL¬∑E himself just might be my favourite character out of the entire canon.",Null,0,0,11 August 2019
Finding Dory," Just as good as the first one
","Pixar has this habit of telling the exact same story with their sequels, yet doing it in such a way that it doesn't bother us. This is a usual sequel problem where the story is the exact same and nothing has changed. And perhaps that's the trick. Because things do change in Pixar movies, yet the characters end up in the same kind of situations despite having grown as people.Take Finding Dory, for instance. The characters we know and love have evolved. Marlin has relaxed a little bit due to the events of the first film, Nemo has matured and Dory has finally found an anchor point for herself. Yet, as you might surmise from the title, Dory ends up lost and this time it's up to Marlin and Nemo to look for her.And it works. It really works. In my mind this is very much on par with the original film. If I was forced to choose, I'd pick the original, but that's solely to the novelty of it, and in this case that counts only as a tiebreaker. The animation quality is still superb, the returning characters feel the same, the story is just as exciting as before, the ocean is still a great place to have an adventure, the new characters are all interesting and it just feels familiar.Is it among my favourite Pixar films? Not really, but that's like saying that you prefer chocolate ice cream over strawberry one. Both are amazing, but the one is just more to your liking. I honestly do think that both this and Finding Nemo don't necessarily need the big action endings they both have, and I'm not a huge fan of Marlin nor Nemo. This film has a bigger action ending, but on the other hand Dory's emotional struggle with her memory loss is some of the best drama Pixar has ever done, so it evens out. And even this is me really nitpicking.It's a good film from Pixar. Definitely worth a shot if you liked the original.",Null,0,2,17 April 2017
Arrival," The additions to the original short story water down this scifi experience
","This is the first Denis Villeneuve film I've actually liked, and it gives me hope for the upcoming Blade Runner 2049, which is a sequel for the 1982 classic. It's based on a short story 'Story of Your Life' by Ted Chiang, and the basic premise goes that twelve alien ships have arrived to Earth. Each has seemingly randomly chosen a spot on Earth to hover over and after a certain amount of time a door always opens, letting explorers in. The movie is told from the point of view of Louise Banks (Amy Adams), a world-class linguist, who's been tasked with communicating with the aliens.On many levels it is an extremely refreshing science fiction experience. It focuses heavily on the protocols of first contact and the difficulties of trying to communicate with a new civilization that's so removed from our own as to make the task almost impossible. That might sound boring to some, but the film is anything but. Insert some unforeseen twists and difficulties, which I shall not spoil here, and we have a more than decent story in our hands.It's also technically superb, as well as well-acted all around. The film looks absolutely fantastic, which has always been Villeneuve's strong suit, but in this he really pulled out all the stops. The first slow shot we get of the alien ship hovering above a misty valley is some of the finest visual cinema I've experienced in years. The whole film has this gritty realism applied to some pretty outlandish visuals and concepts, and it works beautifully. Also huge props for Amy Adams and Jeremy Renner, playing the other scientist in charge of communications. Both are really talented actors, but the show absolutely goes to Adams.Where the film unfortunately loses me a bit is in the additions made to the original short story. There was some military presence in the original as well, but here it has been brought into the spotlight, which doesn't make the film any stronger. The original concept and the original themes were already strong enough. Throwing in some inept criticism against redneck armed forces and strong arm negotiation tactics only takes our focus away from the main idea. The plot also moves around pretty clunkily. For example, there's this general mentioned early on in the film, seemingly casually in the background, but each and every member in the audience could instantly tell that he was going to return to screw something up. The film is full of moments like this, which also takes away from the central idea by pulling on our suspension of disbelief.Nevertheless, despite its flaws, Arrival is a good scifi film. It had the potential to be a great one and there are definitely flashes of that greatness scattered throughout the film. Unfortunately the task of telling a coherent and structured story is where Villeneuve drops the ball a bit. Still very much worth a watch for all those looking for something new in the scifi genre.",Null,1,3,16 April 2017
The Terminal," Heartwarming, kooky, touching
","Viktor Navorski (Tom Hanks) is a citizen of Krakozhia, an obscure non-existent Eastern European country, who arrives at the John F. Kennedy International Airport in order to visit New York City. Unfortunately his country has experienced a revolution while his plane was in the air and has promptly revoked all travelling licenses. Including Navorki's. So, they cannot allow him to enter United States proper, but neither can they send him back, because technically he hasn't been recognized as a citizen of the new Krakozhia. So he has to stay at the airport, indefinitely.Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg have always been a fantastic team and this just might be my favourite film from the two of them. Spielberg's flair for entertainment and intrigue is in full blast. The airport is riddled with personalities and as most of the film is spent with Navorski simply wandering around and interacting with them, it makes sense that they should be the focus of the film. Well, they are and they work wonderfully. I especially like Stanley Tucci's Frank Dixon, the head of the airport, who gets far more than he bargained for in Viktor and is slowly driven to the brink of insanity because of this one man. The film might also be Catherine Zeta-Jones's finest work.But it's Tom Hanks's performance that shines the brightest in this film. Sure his pseudo-Slavic accent is hokey, sure it makes no sense that he doesn't just leave the airport and claim asylum, sure there are a whole bunch of other small things that don't really add up. It's not a very realistic film - though it is inspired by real-life events - but rather a film that pulls you into a story, an experience, an adventure. And in the middle of all that is Hanks, living through it with sad eyes and a solemn face, which every now and then lights up with joy and discovery.If you like Spielberg or Hanks you're going to like this film. If you like them both, you're going to love it.",Null,0,0,2 January 2016
The Shawshank Redemption," Meticulously powerful film
","The Shawshank Redemption is something of an oddity. Based on a Stephen King novella Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption, it has dominated IMDb's Top 250 list for years now and has often been regarded as one of the best films ever made. Almost every adult Westerner has seen the movie at some point during their lives, yet not all that many people talk about this film, at least in my experience. It's not often recommended to others like The Godfathers, it's not quoted as often as The Dark Knight or Fight Club, it's not regarded as inherently cool as Pulp Fiction. So what makes it so great then? In my opinion the answer lies in its quality as a whole. It's not a flashy film. The pacing is slow as time itself - fitting for a prison film, admittedly - the conversations are often quiet and thoughtful, the prison setting never changes, but rather builds up in intensity and while there are emotions and deep themes displayed, they're not over the top or hammered in. Rather they're subtle, real if you will.It's not a film that you will talk about a lot, but it's a movie that will stick with you. It's not a film that will leave you puzzled for days as you try to work through it's meanings, it's not a hard movie to understand, but you'll find yourself returning to it from time to time. And there are a lot of things to return to. The quiet dignity of Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), the friendship between him and Red (Morgan Freeman), the other inmates, the brutality of the warden and the guards, that brilliant moment in the rain, the ending, the callbacks, the overarching and complex plot.The Shawshank Redemption is the jack of all trades of films. Not a single element in it is the absolute best within cinema, but they're all way above average. Everything from the slightest camera angle to the main actors is up to par and beyond. Personally it's not my favourite movie of all time, I admit as much, but it's a masterpiece in its own right. I have nothing against it being the number one.",Null,0,0,1 April 2014
Parasite," About class boundaries and human division
","Ever since his first film, director Bong Joon-ho has been interested in class divide. And nowhere is this more apparent and poignant than in Parasite, where a low-class family of four, down on their luck, infiltrate an upper class household, each posing as a separate helper. One is a tutor to their daughter, another a driver, and so forth.And that alone would be plenty entertaining and fascinating. Each of the four members of the Kim family are a fully realized character, brimming with personality, hopes and aspirations. Sure, what they're doing is questionable and even immoral, but the film is told from their point of view and you can't really hate them for trying to reach for those stars. It's not like they're hurting anyone. Initially.But then the story takes a turn and suddenly it's deadly serious, fiercely intense and full of high stakes and suspense. Before that twist, Parasite was already a great film, but afterwards it became a masterpiece.It also helps that Bong is a splendid director. Each scene, each shot, is measured, beautiful and poignant. The whole film look amazing, but I especially enjoyed the scenes where heavy rain is falling. Such an impactful scene. For the rich, it's just a night of rain drumming their roof. Kind of relaxing, actually. They don't have to worry about it. But for the poor, it's a night of nightmares, floods and loss. For them, it's the end of their lives as they knew it.Parasite earned it's Best Picture Oscar and I'm so glad that the Academy is finally acknowledging these foreign films. It's a film full of heavy themes, brilliant acting moments and enough content to keep you wondering for weeks. Heavily recommended.",Null,1,1,10 March 2020
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," Interesting technique, good characters
","Birdman garnered a lot of attention for its rarely seen cinematography, its interesting story and for its ensemble cast of actors. And deservedly so, because all those elements are what make the film so enjoyable to watch.First of all, the cinematography where the whole film is made to look like one, long, continuous shot. At first it's kind of attention-stealing, because you're looking for it, but surprisingly soon you kind of forget it's there and only notice it when the film calls attention to it by, for example, walking through halls to get to other characters. There are also a couple timeskips achieved through seeming fast-tracking, but those are also tasteful enough that it doesn't pull you away from the story. All in all it's a gimmick, but it's an interesting one.The story and the characters are what make this a good movie. The story is about Riggan, an aging actor, who is mainly known for his role as an early cinema superhero, Birdman. And now he's trying to regain some credibility by producing a play, where he's also the main actor and the writer. What's makes this so brilliant is that they got Michael Keaton, the guy who's mostly known for playing Batman years ago, to play him. If that isn't perfect casting, I don't know what is. And Keaton absolutely owns his role. Nigh perfect acting, not just from him, but also from pretty much all the main actors. Emma Stone and Edward Norton are especially noteworthy for their characters and their own subplot.All in all Birdman is a love letter to theater and to acting in general. It's a character study that examines the themes of loss, past fame, credibility, love both young and old, endurance, frustration and most importantly doing what you love. Well worth a watch.",Null,0,3,9 May 2015
The Big Short," Surprisingly captivating
","The Big Short tells about the years leading to the financial crisis of 2007 and 2008, which was caused by the United States housing bubble. It shows and explains how the situation came to be and how certain people managed to predict its inevitability and exploited it to get rich. It's filled with powerhouse actors, is over two hours long and contains almost nothing but talk about economics, money and similar things.And yet it's a rather good film. This is thanks to a few things. First are the actors. Christian Bale, Steve Carell, Ryan Gosling, Brad Pitt and most of the others are huge talents and their sheer presence manages to make most of the scenes work. The second reason is the script and the fact that it focuses more on the people behind the crisis rather than the crisis itself. It explores how our own ignorance, laziness and stupidity caused the housing bubble and how it took certain amount of outside the box thinking to realize it was happening.That being said, I also admire how the film manages to make the crisis itself understandable and relatable to mass audiences. Whenever the plot brings up a hard term or an odd concept, the film takes a brief moment to stop and explain the thing in layman's terms, but in a way that in no way hinders the narrative. It's actually really clever how they pull it off, though I shall not spoil it here.All in all The Big Short is a really good drama film. I know it doesn't sound that exciting, but trust me that in this case the execution is so good that it just works.",Null,0,0,2 January 2017
Platoon," Brutal war story
","Platoon has the honor of being the first Vietnam War film made by an actual Vietnam War veteran. Director Oliver Stone based the film on his own experiences in the jungle and the end result was one of the most bleak, violent, unforgiving and brutal war movies made by then.The film might also contain the best performance from Charlie Sheen we've ever seen. Chris Taylor is an innocent American youngster freshly recruited into the war effort, forced to grow up quickly within the terror of the battlefield. He's also torn between two man, the sergeants of the company, played by Tom Berenger and Willem Dafoe. Theirs is a private war of ideals and ways of surviving. Both are amazing soldiers, but whereas Dafoe's Elias still holds onto his ideals, Berenger's Barnes is ready and in reality rather willing to do what it takes to finish the mission and survive.And from those story elements we end up getting a harrowing journey through the battlefields, hardships, loss and Pyrrhic victories. Platoon shines because of its non-compromising tone, its actors, its intensity and its vision to tell about the war through the eyes of someone who's been there. It belongs to the elite of war movies for a reason and is easily recommended.",Null,3,4,12 July 2014
Prometheus," Ultimately somewhat disappointing
","I was too hyped up walking into this movie, I freely admit that. The idea of Ridley Scott returning back to his beloved Alien franchise set my expectations too high and I walked out feeling let down and disappointed. Which annoys me, because as a standalone film this one isn't too bad, really. The imagery, the tone, the atmosphere, the mood, some of the main characters... these all work very well. The very first minute of this film is amazing, with sweeping landscapes and haunting music. But then we get introduced to our main plot and my interest basically died.Why, you may ask? Because it's the goddamned Alien and Aliens all over again! We have somewhat meek, but internally strong female lead, we have an unexplored alien planet with a spooky atmosphere, we have a ship with a grim future ahead of it, we have a crew full of personalities, we have an android, et cetera, et cetera... And all of those things would have been just fine in a standalone film. But when you realize that this movie is tied to the Alien franchise, you instantly start comparing the movies and that is the sole fact that kills this movie. It's nothing new, nothing extraordinary or exciting. It's just a director recycling his old ideas and giving them a new coat of paint. Once I realized this fact about ten minutes into the film, I could instantly tell just how the movie was going to go along. And I was right, spot on even.And yet, it's not a bad film. It's disappointing, yes, but it's still enjoyable to watch. Sure you're expecting a bit more, but you can still appreciate it as a prequel or a tie-in as it does answer some of our questions and gives us new insight into the franchise. In addition, the cast is pretty solid (special mention to Michael Fassbender, who's brilliant in his role as David), the score is very good, the imagery keeps impressing and the plot, while nothing new, is at least solid and watchable.Though on the other hand there are some minor plot holes, the supporting characters are not developed properly and I really didn't like Charlize Theron's take on her role. It lacked spunk, in my honest opinion.Would I recommend this to Alien fans? Yes, even with all things considered. It is a solid movie and decent tie-in to the franchise.

Wonder Woman," The movie we need and deserve
","Directed by Patty Jenkins and starring the amazing Gal Gadot, this film finally delivered what we have been expecting from both DCEU, and superhero films in general, for years. Not only does it have a female superhero as the unchallenged lead character, but it's also a genuinely great film with fantastic characters, an engaging storyline, beautiful action scenes and phenomenal production values.And this could have gone wrong so easily. Chris Pine could have been made the actual lead character, with Wonder Woman playing a support role in her own title movie. It could have been just as dark and gloomy as the previous DCEU films. It could so easily have been too corny and pandering.But it's not. Chris Pine is fantastic as the male lead, but this story is about Wonder Woman, and Gadot delivers us one of the best superheros in cinema history. It's so refreshing, almost revolutionary, to see superhero that does good not because she has to, or because she believes she's the only one that can or because she just happened to be there, but because she wants to. Because it's the right thing to do. When you think about it, that's much rarer than you think. There's Captain America. But aside from him, who else? Certainly no one in the DC films. And not all characters can be like that, not all should be like that. But some do.And that whole ideal permeates the entire film. It's honest and goodhearted. It delivers a straightforward origins story that still has the capacity to talk about the meaning of human life, about responsibility, about corruptibility, about the duality of human morality. It believes that people can do terrible things, but also that they can rise up and stand for what they believe to be right. Its heroine is not some distant god-figure - despite being the only literal god in the DC film canon so far - that flies far above us bringing with her chaos and destruction. Rather she walks amongst us and raises us up to stand next to her.It even has colours in it. Actual vibrant colours. And the fight scenes are some of the best I've ever see. The characters have depth and forge actual bonds between one another. It's even funny. Actually funny. I laughed multiple times throughout the film.And yes, the end battle is weaker than the rest of the film. Noticeably so. But it is preceded by a great twist, looks pretty cool and the final ending after that is heartwarming. But the rest of the film is so good that I can forgive that one scene.I healed a little bit inside as I watched this film. It is an honest film, with no trickery, no wise-cracking at the audience, no emotional manipulation. It isn't afraid to be called cheesy because it knows that you have to take that risk in order to connect emotionally. And by gods, does it succeed. Easily one of the best superhero films ever made.

Paths of Glory," About the evils of men and war
","Stanley Kubrick was a very versatile director. His movies differ greatly in subject matter and genre. Yet there are common elements among all of his films. The technical mastery, the tone, and some themes. Of those themes sexuality was a big one, but not as big as war. Or rather the opposition of war.Paths of Glory takes place in the French trenches during World War One. Desperate and ruthlessly ambitious general orders his men to take a hill held by the Germans. This proves to be an impossible task and the men retreat. Incensed, the general accuses his men of cowardice in the face of the enemy and orders one man from every company to be executed by firing squad.This doesn't sit well with Colonel Dax (Kirk Douglas), the regiment's leader, and he appoints himself as their defense at the court-martial.It's an early Kubrick film and thus it doesn't have quite as many 'But what does it mean?' scenes than his more famous films. There are some of those here as well - the ending for example - but it is a surprisingly straightforward as far as Kubrick films go.Yet you can still see his touch in almost everything. Especially on the technical side of things. The film has some great long takes of men walking in the trenches or crawling over the no man's land. The characters are rather black-n-white, or at the very least easy to understand motivation-wise. Which is typical for Kubrick, when you think about it. His characters would develop more grey areas in his later films, but they'd always remain rather... Iconic? Archetypical? They're deep despite it, don't get me wrong. Perhaps it would be better to say that his character are cut with broad, wide strokes, to make them easier to understand in the context of the story.Not the best Kubrick film I've ever seen, but very good nevertheless.

Back to the Future Part II," Some typical sequel problems, but overall a very good film
","Back to the Future Part II picks up from the exact point where the original film left us, with Doc Brown coming to fetch Marty in order to take him into the future. And from that point we get an exhilarating story worthy of the first one. This is also the film that gave us most of those Back to the Future clich√©s and tropes, with hoverboards, self-tying shoes and ridiculous Jaws sequel banners. The future this film imagined was an awesome place, and even though the exact date they travelled to has already passed, it's still a fun to see what the 80s thought the next millennium was going to look like.It's also a great film in terms of keeping up what worked in the original. All the actors reprise their roles, and they're as talented, great and into it as before. Christopher Lloyd as Doc Brown is still easily the biggest showstealer, but both Fox and Wilson give very good and suitably over the top performances as Marty and Biff, respectively, as well.The only problem I have with this film is the fact that it goes over much of the same ground that we already covered in the first film. In many cases we even go over the exact same scenes, only from slightly different perspective. They do it cleverly and I applaud them for their ingenuity, but it still means that we for the most part already know what's going to happen, which makes certain scenes boring to watch. It doesn't really ruin the film, but it was a nuisance, at least for me.But, overall, this is an amazing sequel, one of the best the industry has ever produced. It's fast, loose, filled with laughs and even though it doesn't quite capture the flow and grace of the original, it's still more than worth checking out. Far more.",Null,1,2,9 November 2015

For one thing, it's a pure and honest love letter to mid-century nostalgia. Think Steven Spielberg on steroids. Everything from the visuals to the character archetypes evoke that era, and it does so beautifully. Honestly one of my favourite pulp films ever made. Even though technically this takes place in the Cold War period, and thus isn't really a pulp film, but it has the same aesthetic and feel. If you can watch a movie and immediately think of Indiana Jones, then it's a pulp film, at least a little bit.For another, the characters are amazing. From Hogarth and his child-like wisdom and believe in the concept of rightness to the shady government agent Kent Mansley, who's one of those villains you love to hate, but who you also kind of get in some weird manner. Not to even mention the Giant itself, who's simply great. It's like you gave a bloodthirsty grizzly the soul of a puppy and then made him look adorable and badass at the same time. And the fact that he is entirely CGI yet blended in with the rest of the animation so well that I didn't even notice, is mind-blowing.Pretty much the only thing that I can gripe about is the story. Or rather the fact that this is one of those rare films where the complaint is that it is too short. There seems to be a scene or two missing between the second and the third act, rhythm-wise, but that is explained by the fact that Bird and his team operated on a minuscule budget and under strict time restraints.And frankly, if your only complaint about a movie is that it is too short, then you know you've watched something pretty special. The Iron Giant failed at the box office upon its release because it was barely marketed at all, but luckily more and more people have found it over the years. Do yourself a favour and give it a watch.",Null,0,1,27 June 2017
Taken 2," Lacks the novelty of the original
","Taken 2 picks up the story sometime after the events of the original film. Bryan Mills (Liam Neeson) has mended the fences with his family and things are looking up. So much so that they all decide to vacation together in Istanbul. Unfortunately Bryan still has plenty of enemies left and once again he's forced to wage one man war against terrorists, kidnappers and all around scum.Taken 2 is a decent action film. Neeson gives once again a very good performance as an aged special agent turned security expert, who's perhaps a bit slower than he used to be, but that doesn't mean that he isn't one of the most lethal people still alive. These movies are really nothing more than an ode to his badassery. And there's nothing wrong with that. Sometimes it's simply enough to watch a guy wade through hordes of bad guys, effortlessly dropping them down.What bothers this film is the similarity of its plot to the first one. I do appreciate the fact that the events of the original film have a significant impact on the events of this one, but they still could have come up with a plot that isn't simply the plot of the first one in a different location. Sure, it's a good, efficient and working plot and as a standalone film this is a very good action romp, but it's nevertheless a very lazy choice.So yeah, Taken 2 is nowhere near as good as its predecessor, but it's definitely worth a watch if you liked the original or are simply looking for a thrilling action film that knows how to entertain.",Null,0,1,4 September 2015
Step Up," Lots of energy, lots of spirit
","Three young punks, one of them played by Channing Tatum, break into an art school and proceed to trash the place in the rebelliousness. Like these movie punks always do. Tatum's character gets caught and has to do community service at the school in order to pay for what he's done. But, while serving his time, he finds out that these rich artist kids might have something in common with him. Namely, the passion for dance.The plot is about as basic as they come, with Tatum's character having to help a young female student (Jenna Dewan), who has just lost a dancing partner to an ankle injury, and enlists Tatum's character to replace him. But the film has a lot of energy and good attitude that keep it going even when the plot should bore you to tears. Tatum and Dewan have great chemistry together, and tellingly married a couple of years later. The school is also a fun setting, with an atmosphere of its own and all the side characters show the passion they have for creating things, be it music or dancing or paintings.The film is also shot rather well. The sets look great, it has fantastic colours and all the various dance numbers are shot in a way that allow you to really feel the movement.Nothing much more to say, really. It's exactly what you'd expect from hearing the description, and for some people that can be a problem. Personally, I do like it after a fashion. It's not something I'd regret not having seen, but neither do I regret seeing it. It was a pleasant diversion.",Null,0,0,7 January 2016
Mary and Max," Darkly humorous yet heartwarming tale about two struggling souls
","A movie such as this one is a rare treat. A completely original - albeit inspired by the director's own life - movie from a first-time feature-length director that completely blows you away with its uniqueness, wit and charm. Mary and Max tells the story of its titular characters. Mary being a lonely Australian girl living with her two dysfunctional parents. One of them an alcoholic and the other a complete shut-in practically living in the backyard shed. One day Mary, on a childish whim, decides to write to a random American person. Except that the person on the other side decides to write back. He's Max, an obese forty-something man living alone in New York and suffering from crippling mental health problems.Sound creepy and depressing? Yeah, it does. And yet the thing is, this is one of the most heartwarming and sympathetic movies I've seen in my life. It's also one of the funniest. It is said that something cannot be funny without someone suffering. And boy is that true here. The film's humour is amazingly dark, drawing most of its laughs from the sheer dysfunctionality of its characters and their feeble attempts at improving their lot in life. And yet... yet it is never mean spirited. Mary and Max suffer, that much is true, but they very rarely let it get to them. And when they do, it's a genuinely sorrowful moment because at that point it's more than earned. And thus the movie is about living your life and finding happiness despite everything standing in your way. It's about individuality, about human worth, about friendship and the purpose of caring.It's also phenomenally well-made. It's stop-motion clay animation from start to finish with heavy emphasis being put on the use of colour, facial animation and stuff actually being there. And it looks gorgeous. A true testament to the strength of craftsmanship in this age of computer effects.Mary and Max is a true masterpiece. A film juggling both light and dark, examining both the best and worse qualities of human existence, all with a kind voice and a gentle laugh. A film no one's going to regret seeing.",Null,0,1,22 June 2017
The Silence of the Lambs," Masterful thriller
","The first film in the Hannibal Lecter trilogy, one of the only films to win the Big Five of Oscars, generally considered to be one of the best films of all time and Anthony Hopkins's crowning achievement in acting. And that's only scratching the surface.Everything in The Silence of the Lambs is cinema at its finest. The dialogues are crafted with perfection. These are conversation that simply ooze atmosphere and hint at backstories untold. They're also very memorable and quotable. The characters are out of the ordinary in just the right way. The protagonist Clarice Starling is normal enough, except for her past. But it's the villain that has imprinted himself so permanently to our cultural consciousness. This is a man that they would have worshipped as a god in ancient times. A dark genius, who fields both his smarts and his sophistication with razor sharp focus, always with a knowing smile on the corner of his mouth. He makes even the act of cannibalism look cultured.The movie also deserves a nod for its technical qualities. The visuals and the music support the atmosphere and the mood perfectly and you'd never guess it was made with such a small budget. Money well spent indeed.The Silence of the Lambs is a thriller you must see to truly appreciate the genre. It shows that not all thrillers have to aim for hyperrealism to be successful, that there's room for ideas larger than life and that it's the characters that make it scary, not the amount of blood and dead bodies.",Null,1,2,10 September 2015
The Wolverine," Worthy successor
","I didn't much care for X-Men Origins: Wolverine. Hugh Jackman still was, and always will be, a brilliant Wolverine, but the other characters felt lackluster, the villain was weak and the storyline didn't fit well with the other X-Men movies. It didn't have the same feel.For some time it seemed that the poor critical performances of both that and X-Men 3 would mean there would be no more movies with Wolverine in them, at least in a leading role. Luckily, the film makers decided to do one more and if this particular movie is going to be the last one, I for one can move on happy with what I got.The Wolverine is a movie that works both as a continuation of the X-Men storyline, as well as a standalone movie. The focus is kept heavily on Hugh Jackman, which works for the movie's advantage. There are some callbacks to the events of the trilogy, but as a whole I think this film could have worked just as well without them, if not better, as they are a bit distracting from time to time. But most of the time the focus is on where it should be. In this movie Logan travels to Japan in order to meet an old acquaintance, who wants to settle old scores before his demise. In Japan we get some gorgeous scenery, nice atmosphere, intriguing settings, believable characters, all that good stuff.I especially liked Tao Okamoto's character Mariko, the granddaughter of Wolverine's old friend. Jackman and Okamoto have brilliant chemistry together and when the movie slows down during the second act to give them time to simply interact with one another, it feels justified. Usually that kind of slowing down in an action movie feels boring and unneeded, even sappy, but here it works because the actors have the skills to pull it off. Which is a great thing, because it gives the movie more depth and we get a chance to know Wolverine in a new way that the Origins movie tried to reach, but never could because of its lack of emotional maturity.Unfortunately this film has one major flaw and that is the unbelievably weak villain, known as Viper. Her actress, Svetlana Khodchenkova, just doesn't have the screen presence or acting skills to give the character any memorable attributes. She merely stands there, struts around in her skintight suit and spouts the dialogue. That's it. Sure part of that is poor writing, but it's still rather jarring because the two main protagonists are so damn good. If only the villain had been as good, this could easily have been one of the best Marvel movies yet made.As it is, it's still fine. The two main characters are very good, most of the side characters do a good job as well, the action works wonderfully, the Japanese setting gives the film a nice coating of majesty and even the story, while nothing that extraordinary, functions well enough for us to enjoy it. The villain is weak, very weak in fact, which keeps the film from being great, but you can overlook it and focus on the good stuff.",Null,29,45,14 February 2014
The Dark Knight Rises," Loses to its predecessors despite its undeniable quality
","Batman Begins is the origins story. How Batman came to be. The Dark Knight is him at his prime, operating at his peak level. His triumph. And that would make this film the swan song, the inevitable end. Because in Nolan's Batman verse the real life rules still apply and if you're dressing up in a costume and fighting crime every single night, eventually something's going to give. No one's immortal. Not even Batman.And therein lies the problem why at least I personally have slight problems with the film. We don't want Batman to die or to go away. We want to believe in our heroes, we want them to be something bigger, something infallible. Still, Nolan always went for the more somber, more real, and even though it pains me to see one of my all- time favourite characters in pain and suffering, bowing to the realities of the world, I can see how that would make for an excellent story experience.And for the most part, it does. This is a fitting conclusion to the Batman saga and the escalation is still happening, with Batman (Christian Bale) facing in Bane (Tom Hardy) the greatest enemy he's ever had. What a magnificent villain. Great, intimidating presence, both physically and mentally. The scene, where one of the Gotham crime bosses yells at Bane that he's the one in charge and Bane simply lays a hand gently on his shoulder, leans a bit closer and asks if he feels like he's in charge, is one of my favourite Nolan Batman scenes ever. He only really suffers in comparison to the Joker, who's just so out of the norm great that there's really no competing with him. Bane would be the absolute best, if not for Ledger's Joker.The returning actors are also great, as are the technical aspects, but unfortunately the script has lost some of its edge. It's by no means bad, but it does stumble a bit more than the ones before it. The Dark Knight was a roller coaster of action, emotions and sacrifice, never stopping, never letting you breathe, but somehow it still worked. The Dark Knight Rises is equally fast-paced and relentless, but in it you notice the flaws of such filmmaking. It jumps around a lot and tries to cram an unbelievable amount of detail and action down our throats, but not so skillfully that we do not gag just a little bit.Plus, I really think the film should have ended with Alfred raising his eyes and giving a small nod. Now it goes on for just a bit too long after that. If you've seen the film you know what I'm talking about.Nevertheless, The Dark Knight Rises is by no means a bad film. I enjoy many of its aspects enormously. It's a flawed creation and you can definitely see that Nolan simply didn't have the needed fire and excitement for it, but I still prefer having it than not having it.",Null,0,2,13 March 2016
Black Panther," Visually magnificent, the story could have been better
","The character of Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman) was first introduced in Captain America: Civil War. In it T'Challa was the prince of Wakanda, a mysterious African nation whose technological supremacy has been carefully hidden for centuries. Unfortunately the events of Civil War rob T'Challa of his father and now he's to be crowned king. But there are those that dispute his worthiness.We'll talk about the story in a bit, but if there's one thing Black Panther absolutely nails it's production design. How the film looks, how the costumes are made, what kind of backgrounds are used. That stuff. Because by the heavens if this film isn't one of the most gorgeous pieces of cinema I've ever seen. And from what I've read, they went to great lengths to represent different regions of Africa, giving them voice and visibility. Which has been well-received, I'm glad to hear.Although, speaking of how the film looks, there is one aspect that could have been better. And that's the CGI elements. Those often look rather rubbery and fake, unfortunately, which is a shame because Marvel usually has had really good CGI.I also really like all the main characters. From Boseman's T'Challa to Letitia Wright's Shuri to Michael B. Jordan's Killmonger to so many others. All great characters with interesting motivations and clearly established personalities. Killmonger especially is one of the all-time great Marvel villains. His struggle against Wakanda is born from something personal and identifiable rather than just from a lust to conquer and destroy. You don't agree with him, but you can see where he's coming from.That being said, I found the story itself to be formulaic. It telegraphs rather egregiously where it's going at any given moment and that lessens the tension. Sure, you have fun along the way, but you still watch the film and wish it could have had the courage to do something different. For example, the battle scene near the middle of the film. Could have gone differently, which would have allowed some other characters to step in and make bad choices anyway. Which would have been more dramatic. But no, the winner wins, because of course he does. That's how these stories go.Still, Black Panther is a good movie. A veritable feast for the eyes, with great characters and a story which while by the numbers still delivers what you expect from it.",Null,0,0,14 November 2019
Black Panther," Visually and thematically phenomenal, the story falters towards the end
","Black Panther is the story of newly-crowned King T'Challa (Chadwick Boseman), the sovereign of Wakanda, a hidden African nation secretly renowned for its technological supremacy and its hidden natural resources. T'Challa ascended to the throne after the assassination of his father during the events of Captain America: Civil War, but now he must face threats both from outside and within.Marvel, once again, does not fail us. This movie might very well be one of their best in terms of visual splendour and thematic depth. The nation of Wakanda opens in front of us bright with colour, resplendent in culture and history, representing the whole spectrum of African art and creativity. Add in some really cool action and chase scenes, some cool new tech gizmos, some quality acting - some really high-end quality acting, to be truthful - as well as some really poignant questions about the responsibility of the haves towards the have-nots, and you have the makings of a great movie.Unfortunately I do think that the latter half of the film drops the ball. Most of the events after they return back to Wakanda are... clich√©d. There's really no other word for it. As soon as Michael B. Jordan's character sets foot on Wakandan soil, I could tell minute by minute, almost line by line, what would happen. And that's not a good thing. Sometimes you can make such an obvious, clich√©d plot work, but this is not one of those cases. For example, there's this battle scene in the middle of the film. You know how these stories go. One of them is going to lose, because that's how the story works. So why should you care, at all, about this fight? What's at stake here? Nothing at all, that's what.Black Panther is a good film. The characters are some of the best we've seen from Marvel, as are the visuals. I just wish they had had the creativity to move beyond obvious formulas and story clich√©s in the latter part of the story. Still, very much a film worth watching.",Null,0,1,27 February 2018
Iron Man," Beautiful, simply beautiful
","This stands in my personal ratings as one of the best superhero movies of all time, if not as one of the best movies of all time. It's that good.What makes the movie stand out from its brethren is, first of all, the sheer quality. Everything in this film feels just right. The character of Tony Stark is dead on. I believe that even the most hardcore Marvel nerd would agree that Robert Downey Jr. was perfectly cast for this role. He epitomizes the character beautifully, from the raw charisma to the brilliance of mind to the witty comebacks to the vulnerability of alcoholism. The movie would work just because of him (which the sequels will show), but luckily we get even more for our money. We get special effects that defied all of our expectations, we get a fetching origins story, we get Jeff Bridges as Obadiah Cane (one of his best recent roles) and Gwyneth Paltrow as the perfect Pepper Potts. This is very heavily a character film, which I don't mind at all when the characters are as good as this. Sure there are great action scenes and it's a nice film visually, but it works and it's so good because the characters work off each other so well. You can feel the underlying tension whenever those three share screen time.I could nitpick here and state that perhaps the whole film felt a bit rushed because they had to cram to much material into a single film, or that the final battle could have been slightly better (mostly because of the villainous gloating clich√©), but all these minor complaints pale in comparison to the film as a whole. I love this film. It's a brilliant character study, an even more brilliant action film and one of the best superhero movies yet made. See it, love it.",Null,2,3,17 August 2013
Mother!," It is an allegory, but of what exactly?
","In mother!, directed by Darren Aronofsky, a couple, played brilliantly by Jennifer Lawrence and Javier Bardem, live in an isolated house, far from distractions so as to allow him to finish his next poem. Meanwhile, she tends to their house, wanting to make it into a paradise, in her own words. But then strangers start appearing on their doorstep and things spiral out of control.On a purely plot-level, the film juggles tropes and conventions found mainly in horror and drama genres. The imagery gets increasingly more gruesome, the unsettling feeling of having your home invaded is ever-present and the final third of the film ceases all attempts at subtlety, bombarding our senses with scenes so violent and out of the left field that you absolutely will leave the theater exhausted.And if that was all, I'd probably hate this film. Because it would lack meaning. It would simply aim to shock, to maim your senses of propriety and value. But the film is more than that. It shouldn't be seen as a straight and narrow story about a couple living through unexpected horrors. Rather it's a poem, an allegory about creation, about letting go and trusting your proverbial children to unknown masses. You need to think, who these two represent, what is the house, who are the strangers, why is he so accepting and why is she so guarded.And when it clicks, when you can examine the film through its intended allegory, it becomes quite something else altogether. mother! is not an easy film.

Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Bleak and miserable
","You can have Superman and Batman in the same shared universe. Stylistically they're at the opposite ends of the spectrum, but they can coexist and you can even have them sharing a story. But the thing is that they're still at the opposite ends. Batman is dark and brooding, his stories filled with corruption, fallibility of man and the inevitable doom that looms over every victory. Where as Superman is all about nobility, rising above mortal failings, hope and potential. Which is why you cannot have a decent Superman story told as a Batman story with a sloppy paint job applied!But, even with that, I could live. Henry Cavill is a decent actor and this movie franchise has some seriously talented people working behind the scenes. But unfortunately DC is in too much of a hurry to get its own cinematic universe off the ground and thus this movie is filled to the brim with subplots, foreshadowing scenes and characters beyond counting. It's bad enough that we get the Batman versus Superman plot, but we also have to cram in the ramifications of Man of Steel, Batman's introduction, Wonder Woman's introduction, Lex Luther's introduction and concurrent evil scheme, and finally the final woe, who I shall not spoil here. Any two of these elements would have been enough for a movie. Put all them in a single movie and it's a mess. There's very little rhyme or reason behind the various elements and they don't come together in a graceful manner. Wonder Woman feels especially out of place here, which is a shame because Gal Gadot is surprisingly believable as the Amazonian warrior princess. The complete opposite of Jesse Eisenberg as Lex Luthor, in fact. Who though this was good casting? The man couldn't pull off suavely menacing if his life depended on it. Sure, there are good things as well. Ben Affleck pulls off both Bruce Wayne and Batman beautifully, the visuals, while too dark and grim, are very impressive, the fight scene between Superman and Batman is excellent and I do applaud the film for trying to address the moral ramifications of having almost limitless power in the hands of a literal outsider.But yeah, it's not a very good film overall. It has good things in it, but the structure is not suitable for showcasing any of them in a favourable light. I hope they slow down, take a deep breath and decide that if they are to continue, they need to do it properly.",Null,7,12,18 November 2016
The Emperor's New Groove," Very fast and funny situational comedy
","Originally this movie was supposed to be released under the name of Kingdom of the Sun, director by Mark Dindal and Roger Allers, the latter being a co-director of The Lion King. It was going to be a more traditional Disney adventure musical. Unfortunately the studio and Allers didn't see eye to eye, and eventually the whole idea was scrubbed and the existing material was turned into a buddy comedy.And as far as saving jobs go, they could have done a lot worse. You can definitely see that they had to cut a lot of corners to get the film out on schedule, but the movie has a lot of style, great sense of humour and very likable characters. It's one of the funniest Disney films I've ever seen - if not THE funniest - and stands out from the rest of the canon.The basic premise is that an Incan emperor named Kuzco gets turned into a llama after he fires his royal adviser, Yzma, who happens to be a sorceress of some talent - aren't they all. And now Kuzco has to get back into his palace in order to turn back into a man. The only problem is that the only man who can help him is also the chief of the village he intends to raze to the ground in order to build a summer home for himself. Not a very complicated plot as far as Disney films go, but it's the comedy that brings people back to this film. And that works beautifully. All four of the main characters have very good voice actors and they all have great chemistry together. The film also takes full advantage of its animated nature, giving us some really imaginative scenarios and gags.The only real problem I have is that the plot is very predictable and that the animation, while working very well in terms of comedic value, does look kind of cheap by Disney standards. Plus, while I enjoy the fact that Kuzco starts out very unorthodox for a Disney lead, his eventual character development is about as clich√©d as you can get.Still, I do like the film a lot and it's an easy recommendation for anyone that enjoys Disney and for anyone that appreciates light-hearted comedies.",Null,1,2,14 December 2015
Blade Runner," Tears in rain, in a city that never stops weeping
","The original Blade Runner, directed by then relative newcomer Ridley Scott, is loosely based on a Philip K. Dick novel Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?, but the only things similar are the setting and some of the characters. Even the story only superficially resembles the original written work. As thus Blade Runner has come to stand as its own thing, an inspiration for future films and the cornerstone of an entire subgenre of science fiction. Namely, that of cyberpunk.The story within the movie goes that Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford) is called back into service as a blade runner. Those being hunters tasked with identifying and 'retiring' rogue replicants, artificial humans. Four of these have just arrived on Earth, and Deckard's old boss wants them found and retired. In pursuit of this goal we explore the world of 2019 Los Angeles as well as the themes of humanity versus robotics, the meaning of lifespan, mileage versus years and the illusion of memories.Blade Runner is a slow movie, especially the director's cut that removes the narration added to the theatrical release and returns some of the gorier shots. The film is not terribly action-packed, but rather a neo-noir film set into a dystopian future. It's a detective story through and through, with a philosophical undertone. And for what it is, it's one of the best examples there are. This is a film you can get obsessed over. It almost always requires multiple viewings before you start to truly appreciate it. But when you do, it will likely become one of those defining films, which you'll use to rank all the others like it. And, as stated, it is something of a genre-starter and I'd dare to say that modern science fiction owes a lot of its style and feel to this film. All science fiction.Is it a bit slow? Yes. Is that a problem? You shouldn't let it be. Is it an amazing look into the future of humanity and the rise of man-made intelligence? Absolutely!",Null,1,1,30 October 2017
Bruce Almighty," Good humour and a good moral
","In one of Jim Carrey's best films he plays Bruce Nolan, a news reporter that nurses hopes of one day becoming an anchor, but is seen as too comedic by his fellow workers. Kind of like Carrey probably nursed hopes of one day becoming a real actor.In all seriousness though, this is a good comedy. It mixes Carrey's usual facial antics and high energy with good special effects and gags that actually make sense within the story. The story of course going that this everyday guy gets powers from God (Morgan Freeman) himself. He promptly uses these powers to improve his own life, ruin the career of his competitor and make his girlfriend's breasts bigger. Because that's what we all would do, whether we admit it or not.And therein lies the beauty of this film. It actually has a good message to deliver. And this all culminates in Morgan Freeman as The Big Kahuna himself. Fantastic, heartfelt role and a message that goes unsaid too often. Because it isn't enough that you wish for something to happen. You need to go out and be part of the solution. Don't just wish for a miracle, be the miracle.Is this film a bit clunky? Yeah. Is it immature? Oh yes. But it's also funny, surprisingly thoughtful and has its heart in the right place. Can you really ask for more?",Null,0,1,29 June 2017
Monsters University," Recycling of old college clich√©s
","Monsters University is a prequel to the acclaimed Pixar film, Monsters Inc. In it we meet our two main leads, Mike and Sully, during their college days and witness how they became friends in the first place.Leaving aside the fact that in the original film it was said that Mike and Sully had known each other since elementary school, this is not an awful premise for a story. Granted, I would have rather had a true sequel, where we could perhaps skip to the future and see Boo as a teenager, or even an adult. But a college comedy is fine. It's fine....Truth be told, what bothers me to most about this film is how utterly unoriginal it is. If you've seen any college comedy in your life, you've seen this film. Sure, all the characters are monsters, but aside from that they're such cardboard cutouts. We have the jocks, we have the nerdy outsiders, we have the girl group, we have the strict teacher, we have the goths, we have them all.And nothing interesting is done with them. We even have Randall Boggs, one of the villains of the original film, in his younger form. And he starts out as this geeky, awkward guy, who's super nice to everybody. That could have been so hilarious and so interesting. But nope, goes absolutely nowhere. It's like they forget to tell a joke with him.Still, the animation is nice, there are some good scenes, the character concepts have creativity to them, and even the story is merely bland rather than outright bad. Do I wish they had done something more with this idea? Yes. Do I think it's not worth a watch. Well... no, not really. It's still Pixar.",Null,0,1,11 December 2019
Toy Story 3," Fitting ending to a great trilogy
","It is refreshing to see a third movie in a trilogy that's just as good if not better than the previous ones.Such is the case with Toy Story 3 that continues the story of Woody and Buzz and all their friends. Time has come for Andy to go to college and the toys are yet again faced with the crisis of abandonment. It amazes me that Pixar has managed to tell pretty much the exact same story three times now yet it always feels fresh. Because the story really is always the same. Something happens to the toys that makes them fear they're going to be cast aside or forgotten, this fear leads them to overreact, which causes complications, adventures happen and in the end they've learned a lesson and everything turns for the better. It's like clockwork, it's that predictable, but strangely I don't mind. The circumstances do change and the story always changes a little bit, but I still think it would have been annoying if not for the iron tight storytelling of Pixar's finest.A large part of it is also the fact that Toy Story is a very heavily character-driven franchise. And the characters do evolve. From Buzz and Woody becoming friends to the addition of new characters to the loss of old ones, the characters grow up along with us. And that doesn't change here. This movie has some of the best character moments in the whole trilogy and it's a fitting conclusion to their saga. Pretty much all the voice actors reprise their roles and they're as great as always.My only real gripe about this film is the ending. I know a lot of people love it, but I think most of those people are a bit younger than I am. I'm a 90s kid and I grew up with Disney. I only started watching these movies as an adult. Whereas those kids that grew up in the 00s and with Pixar have a much more nostalgic relationship with the Toy Story characters. So for them the ending is a real tearjerker. For me it's one of the corniest things I've ever seen. I know what they were going for and for their target audience it very well might have been the exact right call, but it still doesn't remove the fact that my jaw literally dropped when I saw Andy acting the way he did. No 17-year-old I have ever met, seen or heard of would act that way in real life. Yes, it's a movie and allowed to take liberties, but you see the problem I'm having, right?Nevertheless, it's a great movie. At times it's surprisingly dark, but never in a way that feels threatening or unnecessary. And it's always warmhearted, gentle, mature and uplifting. It's the perfect way to end this story.",Null,2,3,5 May 2014
Toy Story 3," Very good ending to a very good trilogy
","For the children born in the late 90s and early 00s, Pixar was what Disney had been for many of the earlier generations. A milestone of their childhood, a teacher of morals, one of their best friends even. A constant companion.I was personally born in the late 80s. As such, I can only imagine what thse children must have felt like watching this film and realizing that even an almost literal representation of their childhood had to grow up at some point. In Toy Story 3, Andy is heading to college. He has very little time for his toys anymore, most of them having gone years without being played with. So, what's a toy to do in such a situation?What amazes me the most about these three movies is how eerily similar they are on the surface level, but how different they feel. Because once again the toys get separated and find themselves in a strange environment. Once again they meet new toys with very different ideas about belonging to a child or getting played with. You could summarize all these movie with the exact same words, if you wanted. But they still talk about different subjects and they feel unique.Case in point, Toy Story 3 talks to a much more mature audience than its two predecessors. Sure, you can still watch it as a five-year-old, but its primary message is clearly aimed at those who were five years old when the original Toy Story came out. It wonders what it is like to grow up and look back at your childhood. It wonders what relevance or meaning your earliest memories have on you when you're an adult.And while it's doing that, we get a very good overall adventure, with great locations, fantastic animation, imaginative characters both heroes and villains alike, and some real tearjerker scenes. The ending, for example, which I personally find quite corny and unreal, but then again I wasn't a child when these movies came out. The ending cannot have the same impact on me.A very good movie and it would have been a fitting ending to this particular saga. It turns out it wasn't the ending we thought it was, but then that's show business for you.",Null,0,0,6 October 2019
Trainspotting," Shocking yet profound
","This movie has a reputation as an unpleasant experience. And I'd have to say for a reason. Yet what often goes unmentioned is the fact that this movie is quite often classified as a black comedy. Again, for a reason.The story tells of a group of Scottish youngsters struggling through life despite their crippling addiction to heroin and other hard substances. We see them throughout the course of a perhaps a few years. Their highs and their frequent lows. Yet despite all this misery in their lives, they retain a surprisingly chipper attitude about life. They crack jokes, they talk in their thick Scottish accents, they have parties. Yet just beneath the surface, the heroin tightens its grip.And it's not like director Danny Boyle wants to glorify or romanticize drug use. No, it's still clear that these people have ruined their lives and those around them through their awful life choices. But the movie argues the point that these people are not stupid. There's a reason why people use drugs. Quite often they are the symptom of a life gone wrong rather than the cause.Very much a movie not for everyone. But, if you can stomach all those nasty scenes, the movie does have a story to tell. A good one and one excellently told.",Null,1,2,29 January 2018
Before Sunrise," A romance film with a thinking brain
","Two young people are travelling in Europe. They happen to meet on a train and decide to get off at Vienna to spend a day together before travelling back to their individual homes. This movie is pretty much that one evening and night they spend together.Sounds like a pretty typical romantic drama or comedy, doesn't it? And yes, to a certain degree I agree. A few things set it apart from the rest, though. First, the age of the two leads. At least in my opinion these movies are usually about teenagers or about people in their thirties or late twenties. But these two are in their early twenties, barely at that. They're adults, but only just about. And that is reflected in their characters very well. I can easily imagine that I was just like this five to seven years ago. Being more comfortable in your skin than you were during your adolescence, but still unsure about the world and your place in it. Starting to get an idea about what you think about the world, what kind of a person you are, but still deep down very undecided about anything.Secondly, I do admire the fact that these two are most interested in the personalities of each other. The film is laden with dialogue for a reason. It's mostly them getting to know one another, talking just about anything. There are certainly romantic scenes, but even they're rather talkative. And these are good talks. Once again, their age is reflected very well in how they talk and what they talk about.Full compliments to Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy as well. They play their characters beautifully. Sure, Hawke's character is a bit cocky for my taste, but he's not a bad kid by any means. Just a bit full of himself. Then again, I do have to admit that I probably was as well at that age.Before Sunrise is a nice breath of fresh air. A romantic drama where the attraction comes from the mind and not just from the fact that they're two ridiculously good-looking people.",Null,0,0,1 October 2018
The Deer Hunter," Epic story about friendship and the effects of war
","What we have here is a slow, thoughtful and intense drama done correctly. The film is a long one, with a running time of three hours, and its filled with scenes that just don't seem to end or to have any particular point. The wedding scene for example just seems to go on and on. In a weaker movie these kinds of scenes would bore the viewer, perhaps even make the film unwatchable. Not in this case. Because this isn't really a movie about the Vietnam war, like so many people seem to think. Admittedly the war part of the film is the most memorable and the one that people bring up most often, but the movie as a whole is more about the friendship between its main characters. The war is always there, certainly, but its point is to showcase how the terror of combat and the mental torture that follows affect people and how we all cope differently. Some of us manage to muscle through and go on to spend relatively normal lives. Some of us crack, however, and the film goes to great lengths to make us understand just how deep that single crack can go. How it can ruin the best of us.But for us to understand we first have to understand the people that are put under this pressure. And that's why those slow scenes of wedding receptions, hunting trips and bar evenings are so important. They have this quality of realism. Like we could be right there next to them, sharing a joke or a drink. I'm sure there are some, who still get bored by this film, but I personally enjoyed each and every single shot. At times the film had almost a dreamlike quality, especially towards the end, reflecting the surrealism that is normal life after you've gone through war. The music was discreet, the scenery slightly blurry and nothing much was said, rather the mood was given time to build. We were given time to ponder and reflect.Add in brutally good role performances by pretty much all of the main actors and you have a film that even Sergio Leone would be proud to call one of his own. The movie actually greatly reminds me of Once Upon a Time in America and not just because they share a main actor in Robert De Niro. The same mood is there, the same gripping touch of real life mixed in with dreamlike hallucinations and larger than life concepts that hide in the background.This is a great film, one that everyone should see. It's subtle and thought-provoking, while still working both as a period piece and a character study. Masterful film-making at its best.",Null,1,4,9 November 2012
Saving Mr. Banks," Fun little biography, though not without its faults
","The worst and the best parts about Saving Mr. Banks intertwine a great deal. On the other hand, it's a delightful little tale about a woman learning to cope with her past and about the making of one of the best family films of all time. And yet, on the other hand, it looks at the past through rose-tinted glasses, ignores some of the uglier truths about what actually happened and is generally extremely cheesy and sugarcoated.I'd still claim I liked this film. Emma Thompson makes for such a delightful P.L. Travers that it's hard not to sympathize with her, no matter how despicably awful she acts towards anyone else or no matter how difficult she's being over the smallest of things. Fantastic role performance all around.The rest of the cast is likewise up to the task and wonderful, with perhaps the sole exception of Tom Hanks as Walt Disney. I'm not really sure what doesn't work here, but he seems to be perhaps a touch forced and overly jovial. This is pretty much the first time Walt Disney has ever been depicted on screen by the actual Disney Studios and you can definitely see they're trying to put their best foot forward with Hank's performance. Not that I'm saying the actual Walt Disney wasn't a kind and wonderful man with mountains of imagination and vision to share, but this character doesn't feel rounded enough to be a real person.And yeah, it's kind of hard to see this movie when you know that the actual P.L. Travers hated the sole film based on her books and wanted nothing to do with Disney ever since. Of course there are some who say she actually grew to like it, and I can't really blame Disney of all studios trying to go with the optimistic version, but there's optimism and then there's naivety. It's really up to each to decide for himself or herself whether they find this twisting of circumstances and facts acceptable.As a film Saving Mr. Banks is a lot of fun and filled with great role performances, good scenes and excellent storytelling. As a biography it leaves a lot to be desired, but you kind of knew that even without me telling you, didn't you.",Null,1,3,9 August 2014
Jojo Rabbit," Goes from heartwarming to absolutely dread in an instant
","Jojo Rabbit must not have been an easy movie to sell. A movie featuring a Hitler youth boy in the last days of World War Two, with an actual Adolf Hitler as his imaginary friend. Sure, it's a satire, obviously, but even still... how do you get stuff like this green-lit?Well, being Taika Waititi, one of the most unorthodox directors currently working, must have helped. Especially when he himself wanted to play the role of Hitler. And I must say, the film works rather well. It's able to make you laugh big time, while also telling a heart-wrenching story about the struggle of Jews and those wanting to help them during the Third Reich. To a certain point, but let's but that aside for a moment.Because I want to praise the actors. Thomasin McKenzie as Elsa, the Jewish girl, does a great job as someone terrified out of her soul, but unwilling to show it, while Roman Griffin Davis shines as Jojo himself. I especially enjoy how clearly he changes throughout the course of the film, learning to see the world for what it is and not what he wants it to be. But the MVP award for this movie has to go to Scarlett Johansson as Jojo's mother. What a character! Full of lust and zest for life, as well as smiling maturity. Every scene she's in, especially when she's just talking to Jojo, I could watch forever.All that being said, I did find myself struggling with the film when it came to mood swings. Whenever the film wants to be funny, it's funny enough. Whenever it wants to crush your soul under an iron boot, it does just that. It's only that these two aspects of the film have a hard time meeting. I found myself choking up because of a certain scene and then I'm expected to chuckle in the next scene.And I'm not sure how you would go about fixing that. Perhaps if the humour had been even more absurd than it is? There are a few scene that go way over the line to absurdity, like Hitler eating a boiled unicorn head, but most of the time the humour is rather grim and/or dry. Then again, had the humour been more absurd, it might have cut tension from the truly dark scenes.It's a movie I appreciated, but I'm not sure I enjoyed it. Or more accurately, I enjoyed every single scene on its own, but not necessarily together. Make of that what you will.",Null,0,1,29 January 2020
Thor: The Dark World," The worst Marvel movie so far
","Thor: The Dark World is the worst film Marvel has done in their Cinematic Universe. So far. And it still means that, by any objective standard, it's a good film with plenty of great action, phenomenal visual effects and good actors.It's just that the story is boring. We get to see Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) once again as she continues to unravel the mysteries of the universe with her band of plucky sidekicks. Meanwhile, an old threat awakens to cast a shadow over the peace of Asgard, the Realm Eternal. And thus Jane and Thor (Chris Hemsworth) meet once again to protect the Nine Realms. Sounds exciting? It could have been. Unfortunately, whereas in the first Thor movie we had an extremely interesting and dynamic villain in Loki (Tom Hiddleston), here the villain is about as interesting as watching a cattle drive. It sounds and seems exciting at first, but the monotony settles in very quickly. Malekith (Christopher Eccleston) has no edge, and quite honestly no personality either. He wants to take over the world because... he wants to take over the world. All the Marvel villains before this film had been huge. They were individuals, larger than life, always scheming, plotting, usually with a smirk on their face. This... man... elf... emo band reject, on the other hand, is only distinguished from his troops by the fact that he speaks a bit more and has a snazzier uniform.The rest of the movie is fine. It's not as good as the first Thor, or any of the other Marvel films, but the returning actors are on the top of their game, it's certainly nice to see Jane, Darcy and Erik once again, not to mention Loki - who still absolutely steals every scene he's in - and the visuals works splendidly. It's only that the story cannot be as captivating as it needs to be without an effective villain.Thor: The Dark World is not the first bad Marvel film, the coming of which we fearfully still await and hope to avoid completely, but it is the first Marvel film that can only be described as average on the whole. Which makes it disappointing, but ultimately still worth a watch.",Null,2,4,5 July 2015
Lucy," Stumbles on old clich√©s and artsy tropes
","I don't really mind clich√©s, if they're done well, or if the film maker tries something new with them. But could we please let this ridiculous 10 percent thing go already? It's simply not true, and it hasn't been believed to be true for decades now. We humans use most of our brains for simple everyday functions. Perhaps only 30-40 percent at a time, but it's still significantly more than the alleged 10 percent.But, it's a single trope in a movie. A central one, certainly, but if the rest of the film was better, I wouldn't really mind all that much. But unfortunately it's not. The story itself is not a bad one. Luc Besson has managed to create this sweeping storyline about the birth of divinity within an ordinary woman - a theme I've often encountered in anime, in fact. Scarlett Johansson's Lucy has to deal with the evermounting loss of humanity as she becomes more than any human has ever been. Yet most of her actions are altruistic in nature, which I find refreshing.The biggest problem this movie has is that it doesn't go full throttle with its scope. There are certain artsy elements and imagery to its delivery that try, but that's only window dressing. The theme of transcendence doesn't open up to as, we don't learn anything about it. The most we get is that Lucy can think faster, and thus type faster on a computer and spout of scientific theory to university professors. The bare bones of an idea are there, but the meat is lacking.Plus the villains are superficial and unnecessary beyond their role in setting the film in motion, yet they're constantly brought back in to create action scenes. And the mood suffers accordingly.Lucy has a lot of good elements in it, from Johansson's performance, to special effects, to rather excellent cinematography to the aforementioned action scenes, which feel unnecessary, but are pretty to look at. It's only the mix of them that feels wrong, and thus brings the film down. Lucy is worth checking out if you're into science fiction or Scarlett Johansson. The rest of you should move on.",Null,0,5,29 September 2014
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Promising relaunch of the franchise
","It's good. Everyone just relax, take a deep breath. It's good. Borderline great even. J. J. Abrams has managed to bring back Star Wars like it was in the original trilogy, though naturally updated to the new century and with a spin of his own.The two things I like the most in this film are the characters and the continuation of the story. This film feels like a logical continuation of the story we left behind in Episode VI. Sure, at the end of the film there are still questions unanswered and we still don't know everything about how the New Order came to be, what Han, Luke and Leia have been doing in the meantime, et cetera, but it just means that there's material for the sequels. The writers had a lot of options for them to choose from, and while the version we end up getting is not the most imaginative possible, neither does it completely ignore the previous films like so many lesser franchises are fond of doing.The returning characters are also at the top of their game. Harrison Ford has the most screen time and his performance is about as perfect as it could be. You instantly see old Han Solo in front of you when he appears. And luckily the new characters are just as good. Rey and Finn, played by Daisy Ridley and John Boyega respectively, are both great, nuanced and instantly identifiable characters that both explore new territories in the Star Wars universe, allowing us to see slightly different sides of things. Like the point of view of a stormtrooper.The visuals are also stunning. Abrams's team has pulled off some really impressive stuff here, and I especially like the use of practical effects. Cinema at its finest and certainly one of those films that almost have to be seen on the big screen for them to really shine. The score by John Williams does not contain quite as memorable new segments as all the previous films did, but it's still very solid overall.The film is not perfect however. Adam Driver's Kylo Ren is something of a hit and miss with me. He starts out very well, being absolutely terrifying as the new iron fist of the new emperor - or supreme leader as he is called this time. But then the film tries something different with him, something we didn't really see with Darth Vader or Darth Maul, and quite honestly I don't think it works that well. You know what I'm talking about when you see the scene. Still, it leaves us with some exciting possibilities for the sequels so perhaps they going somewhere with this. We will see.And yes, then the biggest problem. The plot is almost identical to Episode IV. We have a droid carrying secret information, we have a desert planet orphan being taught by an aging mentor who's a veteran of the previous war, we have the orphan joining the resistance against a galactic empire, and so on, and so on. Now, they claim that this is because Abrams and his team had to prove that they get Star Wars and to make up for the prequel trilogy. But come on, this is just ridiculous. We would have believed you with less. Much less.Still, it is a good film, very good in fact. The technical aspects are flawless, the characters are great and it just feels like Star Wars through and through. If only the story had been a bit more original, this could have stood on par with the original trilogy. Or at least very close.",Null,4,30,4 January 2016
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Flawed, but it's still Star Wars
","J. J. Abrams couldn't have had it easy. He had to bring back Star Wars for the diehard fans, had to appease those that didn't like the prequel trilogy, had to take into account the new fans... all the while working for the Black Mouse of Disney, who's notorious about keeping it clean and family friendly.And keeping that in mind, this is a pretty good movie. Borderline great. Is it as good as the original films? No, it's not. But there's a very small chance that it ever could have been. The planets simply weren't in alignment.The things I like about this film are the characters and the atmosphere. This feels like Star Wars. Everything is dirty and falling apart. We have these fantastically futuristic gadgets, but they're rusted, filled with sand and need a good kick every now and then to work. That's Star Wars in a nutshell. The cinematography is also gorgeous and this film has some of the finest shots seen so far in the franchise. I especially like the shot of a humongous Star Destroyer battleship half buried in the desert. Gives the whole world gravitas and history.And the characters are great. From John Boyega's Finn to Daisy Ridley's Rey to Oscar Isaac's Poe Dameron. Quintessentially Star Wars these characters, while also exploring new ground.But, let us not forget the returning cast. Ford, Fisher and Hamill slip effortlessly back into their career-defining characters and we couldn't have been happier.The one major thing I don't like about this film is the fact that's it's pretty much a retelling of Episode Four: A New Hope, the original film. We have an orphan on a desert planet hearing the call of adventure, we have a droid hiding secret information, we have the evil empire, we have a masked bad guy in black, we have the reluctant outlaw ally, we have the scene in a cantina/bar, and so on and so on.An admiring nod now and then would be fine, appreciated even. Paying an homage would be expected. Telling the story all over again, beat by beat, is simply lazy.Sure, there will be those that tell you that it's supposed to be this way, that it is intentional and that they wanted to introduce Star Wars to a whole new age group. But, tell me, how many people are going to see this as their first Star Wars film? Not many, I tell you. The original film is such a huge cultural milestone that there's no way the majority of people in the future are going to see this film before that one. Which makes this whole shtick of doing it all over again simply pointless.Nevertheless, it's a good film. A bit aggravating, true, but still good.",Null,1,8,18 December 2019
Cinderella," Tremendous comeback
","In 1950 Disney finally returned to full feature animations with Cinderella, one of their greatest comebacks to date. A film that quite literally saved Walt Disney Animation Studios and allowed them to continue shaping our childhoods.It's also the first fairytale film Disney had produced in a long time, featuring only the second Disney princess at the time of its release. A film of many returns and a film that helped to solidify what a Disney film was to mean.And it's a fantastic film in its own right. The animation is once again some of the best ever made, which must have been a true treat for the audiences at the time after a full half of a decade of nothing but shorts of varying quality. Here the quality is topnotch, though we still have a few films to go before Disney would once again start to push the medium forward with Sleeping Beauty.The story is of course a classic, and nowadays the version almost all think of when they hear the name Cinderella. Disney has always been at its best when it's doing adaptations, this being no exception. The best parts of the original fairytale are transformed into the silver screen experience we've all come to love.If I had to name one problem, I have to admit that the mice are a bit annoying now that I'm an adult. As a child I don't remember minding them at all, but now... Oh well, it's no like they ruin the film, so it's a minor flaw.Cinderella is an important film in Disney canon.

RED," Excellent action comedy
","Let's face it, RED is nothing more than an excuse for aging actors to come together, shoot stuff up and play tough as nails action heroes. Kind of like Expendables, except intentionally hilarious. And it's that intent to be a comedy that raises this film above Expendables. The idea of old ex-agents going out for a last hurrah is ridiculous enough, but when those agents are played by Willis, Malkovich, Freeman, Mirren and Cox, it just cannot be taken seriously. Sure, you'll buy that these people could have been badasses, but the visual of Helen Mirren shooting a gatling gun is still one of those funniest things I've seen in a while.Luckily the film never takes itself too seriously and most of the film is filled with lampshade hangings, callbacks, parodies and jokes about how old they are. All of the main actors are powerhouse performers, and it shows. They have great chemistry together and obviously enjoy spending time together like this, which is reflected in the quality of their acting.The story is nothing special, truth be told, but for a comedy plot it's not all that bad. It catches your interest, keeps you interested and contains a few honest twists. Could it have been a bit better and more original? Sure, but I have no real complaints about what I ended up getting. You're going to see this film for its humour and actors, not for its story.RED is a definite must watch for all fans of even one of its actors, for fans of action comedies and for everyone who wants to be entertained.",Null,0,0,22 May 2014
Rear Window," Reliable quality
","Hitchcock is one of those director's that you're not really allowed to hate. The man has such a reputation that if you don't like one his films, you're just not getting it or there's something wrong with you. Mostly this reputation is well-earned as his movies are extremely good and well-made, but sometimes this expectation to love a film causes sort of a backslash where you're fighting against the film, critiquing every little detail, not allowing it to pull you in. Thus I think that I did myself sort of a disfavour with Rear Window. I liked it quite much, but my expectations were too high.What did the movie get right? The characters for one. The main couple of Jeff (James Stewart) and Lisa (Grace Kelly) is the centerpiece of the entire film and these two actors pull it off beautifully. The characters are quite different, but both actors play them quite similarly by adding a lot of charisma to them, as well as an underlying streak of good humour. With Lisa this streak is quite visible at times, as she is almost always smiling and a pleasant person in general. With Jeff it's a bit more subtle, but Stewart plays the character like he's usually quite a charmer, but now that he's been forced to spend several weeks indoors, he has become quite grumpy as a result. Very subtle performances from both, as is to be expected from two stars such as them.Furthermore the various inhabitants of Jeff's neighbourhood are also quite interesting and given a lot of character, even though most of them only have a few lines of dialogue, if even that. But Jeff has spent weeks observing them and we see them through his eyes, which makes them more real and gives them colour. The names, such as Miss Lonely Heart and Miss Torso are especially telling.I also quite liked the themes that got addressed throughout the film. The film has surprising amount of depth, considering that the premise itself is quite simple. A man notices that something is amiss with his neighbours and decides to investigate. With a lesser director that would have been all, but Hitchcock adds in a lot more without making it feel clustered. The obvious mystery plot is still the main attraction, but the film has lots to say about relationships, neighbourhoods and human character in general. And none of these themes feel forced or preaching. A lot isn't even said aloud, rather various shots and visuals are used to both introduce the characters and to deepen their personalities. This leaves more time for meaningful dialogue because it isn't needed to force in exposition.What wasn't so hot in my opinion, so to speak? The main mystery, frankly speaking. Of course this is such a classic film that it's hard to see it without knowing how it's going to go beforehand, but I still would have liked for it to have been a little more complicated and/or deeper. Now the problem is introduced and at least I deduced instantly what had happened. Thus the main conflict isn't really finding out what happened, but finding out how they're going to prove it. Perhaps Hitchcock meant it to be like this, but I would have preferred a bit more ambiguity. The story itself isn't all that bad and it is told masterfully, with no motions or scenes wasted, but the mystery is overly simplified. For me that was a problem, but it doesn't mean that it will be so for everyone.Final thoughts: It's a strong film because of its characters, its skillful technical details and its sheer flawlessness. The mystery plot might leave you wishing for more, but it's not an outright flaw, rather than a matter of opinion. So I quite liked the film, though I wouldn't call it one of the best films of all time, like some do. It's great, but not that great.",Null,3,5,26 December 2012
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," The definition of epic fantasy
","The end of Middle-Earth draws near as the armies of orcs march against Minas Tirith, the great city of Gondor and the last bastion of Men, while at the same time Frodo and Sam have reached the borders of Mordor with their guide Gollum. Darkness spreads and all hope seems to wane, for even if the diminishing strength of Men were to prevail against crushing odds, their fate rests on the shoulders of a hobbit, the smallest of beings.The Return of the King is an epic conclusion to The Lord of the Rings trilogy. All the individual plot lines come crashing together as we witness the last great battle between the forces of good and evil. This is grand fantasy at its finest. Every time you're allowed to draw breath and every time you hold your breath in fear and terror, there's something new and even more majestic waiting to reveal itself. The Battle of the Pelennor Fields in front of Minas Tirith is probably the finest individual battle scene I've ever seen put on film. An opinion shared by many. And the thing is, it has aged remarkably well. Here and there you can spot the use of CGI, but not often. I've seen big budget movies this year, full twelve years later, which look noticeably worse than this film in that regard.I also really like how the scale shows not just in battle scenes but in every other aspect as well. The dialogues are full of emotions, great speeches, deep feelings, talks about fate, the elusiveness of hope, the strength of belief. Sure, it's escapism, but at its finest. This movie is the prime example of why we still tell stories to ourselves.And yeah, I'm the first to admit that this is the most flawed film in the trilogy. They have turned Gimli into a complete joke character at this point. There are perhaps one or two endings too many. The ghost army subplot comes a bit out of nowhere. The emotions do boil over a touch too much. But in the end, I still love this film and this world. It is an archetype, an ideal against which all alike stories are measured.The Return of the King is my least favourite film in The Lord of the Rings trilogy. It's still easily one of my favourite movies, one of the finest epic movies ever made and more than worthy of all its praise.",Null,2,3,15 September 2015
The Purge," Needed to be more satirical
","The Purge starts with a concept. What if for one night in a year all crime was legal, including pillaging, vandalism, rape and murder. All of it. It's an interesting idea. Naturally it could never happen in real life, but that's not the point. It's the work of fiction to explore the possibilities, even the impossible ones, because they're all reflections of our society, our psyche as humans.Unfortunately, the execution leaves something to be desired, being really nothing more than an intruder horror drama. A family is locked inside their own house to escape the purging, and when everything doesn't go according to the plan, you can pretty much guess what will happen. I would have liked to see this idea explored on a larger scale, or with more attitude. Now it tries to play it safe, or perhaps too realistically. Like this is supposed to be a warning against this sort of solution.Then again, all the actors do their jobs very well. Rhys Wakefield is especially amazing as a polite leader of hooligans out to purge for the night. He almost summons back the spirit of Alex DeLarge from A Clockwork Orage to possess him and bring us back that good old ultra-violence.The Purge is a decent film. It had the potential to be much more, but what we end up getting has some seriously creepy imagery, the action and the horror both work and it's an interesting idea to mull over for an hour or two.

A Nightmare on Elm Street," One of the classics of horror genre
","The original A Nightmare on Elm Street is seen as game changer in the horror genre. It pretty much codified the meaning of slasher film, where a group of teenagers is chased by a supernatural horror, with heavy overtones suggesting that it's because of their budding sexuality. Yeah, not exactly subtle, especially because it's almost always the young virgin female that survives, but the subgenre has other things to offer and it's the excellence of this movie that has spawned so many sequels and imitators.So what's the story? A group of teenagers are all dreaming about a boiler room and about a man with burnt skin and terrifying claws chasing them within. One of them, Tina (Amanda Wyss), is especially worried and asks her friends to have a sleepover with her in order to help her sleep in peace. And naturally things don't go like they're supposed to. For Freddy's coming for you.It's a fantastic setup and what makes this film so strong is how unsettling they make that blurring line between dreams and reality. For if you're not safe within your dreams, where can you run? How can you hide? The film slowly builds upon this idea, raising the stages constantly. Helping this atmosphere are some really, really nice practical effects, some of the best I've ever seen in a horror film. It's bloody and gory beyond belief, choreographed beautifully and simply a joy to watch for all fans of slasher genre. Colour me impressed.The thing I was a bit disappointed by is actually the villain. Freddy certainly has a striking look, very good actor backing him up and his powers are certainly worthy of his status, but the movie gets rid of him rather easily, making me feel disappointed. Sure it's a proper horror film in that it doesn't have a true happy ending, nothing like that, but I still expected a bigger climax. Plus the actual kid protagonists are more than a bit bland. Perhaps I should check out the sequels.Nevertheless, it's a must-see horror film for all fans of the genre and certainly a good film to check out in any case. As long as you're not squeamish about blood.",Null,2,2,3 September 2015
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire," Excellent sequel and a book adaptation
","The Hunger Games: Catching Fire continues the story of the first book/movie with blazing abandon, consistent character development and increasing stages. It's a film worthy of its predecessor, and it very well might be even better.Jennifer Lawrence is the unquestioned star of these movies. Katniss Everdeen is the central focus of the story, and I love it. Her struggles, vulnerabilities, victories and defeats are the driving force behind the plot and how the audience reacts to it. And the best part is that Lawrence completely submerges herself into the role, easily switching tracks whenever needed. Katniss as a character is very closed off, very guarded, which carries the risk that an actress playing her would seem stilted or wooden, but not with Lawrence. You can see the subtle emotions playing across her face at any given time, and the final scene where she stares directly at the camera and you can see dozen emotions running across her face one at a time. Shudders, man, goosebumps even.Not to say the rest of the cast is untalented either. Woody Harrelson and Donald Sutlerland are as great as ever as Haymitch and President Snow, respectively. Josh Hutcherson as Peeta was actually better in this one, in my opinion. More bitter, which gave him depth. I'm still not completely sold on Liam Hemsworth as Gale, but he did his job. Too much of an obvious tragic bad boy, I think. And the rest of the actors did equally good jobs, managing to convey a lot of exposition and storytelling with relatively little screen time and with a lot of grace.The special effects and the visuals were very good. Larger budget obviously meant improvement in these areas, and it shows. And thankfully they toned down the shaky cam, which improved the viewing experience so much. It's also a well directed film. The storytelling is smooth and flawless. A complex and multilayered story is laid out in front of us in a way that feels natural and is easy to follow. At no point did I felt that they skipped over anything or that the film lingered too much. It was a well-paced, well-told story with a proper, might I even call it perfect arc. The closest one to perfection I've seen in recent years.If I had to nitpick I'd say that when we get back to the actual Hunger Games, the novelty has worn off. The arena is still exciting and at least it's different enough that it feels somewhat new, but the actual mechanics of young kids and adults fighting against one another are nothing we haven't seen before. It's still good and it's still enjoyable to watch as an action piece, but oh man, what if this arena had been the arena in the first film. That would have been unbelievable. Still, a nitpick at most, so don't turn away from the movie because of that.I liked this film. The ending left me wanting for more and I can't wait for the next one. This is what a sequel should be about. Continuation of the story, more character growth, new characters in moderation, doing what the first film did right, learning from the mistakes of the earlier films. The whole package. If you liked the first Hunger Games, you're going to love this one.",Null,0,12,12 January 2014
Godzilla," Some baffling storytelling decisions in this one
","A Godzilla movie that only shows Godzilla in brief establishing shots and then veers away when the action is really starting, only to cut back to the aftermath of the said action. It's like the film makers were trying to emulate the old Godzilla movies without realizing that the film makers back then would have liked to show more Godzilla, they just didn't have the budget for it. Hence the cuts.So yeah, the film doesn't exactly deliver like it's supposed to with this kind of budget and expertise. I wouldn't even mind, but we just saw Pacific Rim last summer, a far superior monster film by far. This film spends way too much time following around these soldiers opposing Godzilla and the other monsters, than it does showing us these monsters. I literally had to pick up my jaw a couple of times. So baffling were these focus choices.And yet, it does work, kind of. Because the film starts out phenomenally well. The suspense builds up slowly, the mood and the atmosphere are both bleak, intense and dark, the setting is introduced with care and we actually get some really good characters and character moments. Bryan Cranston's Joe Brody is a great character and I'd have loved for this movie to be solely about him, and perhaps Ken Watanabe. But then we start to focus more on Brody's son Ford (Aaron Taylor-Johnson), Godzilla shows up, turns out to be a big disappointment and it all spirals downhill from there.It's not a bad film. A disappointing one, yes, but it has enough bang for your buck. The first act is great and whenever the actual monsters are on screen, the film immediately picks up in quality. If only they had had the sense to not shy away from the monster, this could have been an excellent movie. Now it's merely average.",Null,2,6,28 June 2014
Looper," Not perfect, but still surprisingly good
","What we have here is a science fiction film that doesn't try to thrill you with flashy special effects, explosive action scenes and muscled main starts, though it has all of those in some capacity. Rather it relies on a clever premise, charismatic characters and a suspenseful mood to carry the whole story.And yes, I say clever premise even though the idea of sending one's enemies of the future into the past to be killed by hit men is pretty ludicrous. If you were to think about it logically, you really only needed one guy to run the whole business in the past. One guy would set up a furnace and they would just send all the unwantables into that furnace where they would burn away. But even though the whole looper business could have been handled a whole lot more efficiently, it's still a cool premise that allows for a lot of cool scenes and characters, so I didn't really mind. Besides the very idea of pitting Bruce Willis against his younger counterpart is a reason enough to allow some gaps in logic. The rule of Bruce Willis applies here.So yes, I really liked this film, but the reason why it didn't get a higher score is that the final half of the film just isn't as strong as the first. The whole film starts as a prelude to a fight between these two characters, whose only difference is their age. You could have had a lot of cool chase and fight scenes with them being able to predict what the other was thinking just because they thought the exact same thing. It could have been a battle between a man and his shadow, each having slightly different strengths - the younger could have had the body and the stamina and the older could have had new tricks and experience - but instead the whole plot gets sidetracked when a minor plot point is suddenly lifted into the center. This new plot is foreshadowed to a certain degree and it does work, but if I'm being honest with myself, I'd have rather watched an epic battle between Bruce Willis and Joseph Gordon-Levitt. I guess the story that we do get allows for more romance, moral lessons and the usual Hollywood story-telling clich√©s, which makes the film more appealing to a wider audience than just the fans of intense action, but dammit, I wanted to see an epic battle between Bruce Willis and Joseph Gordon-Levitt. I still get something to that effect, but it's... just not as good.But no, even though I rant about it, I don't think that this is a bad film, quite the opposite in fact. The final half of the film isn't what I was expecting to get, but it's still a good story, heart-warming even, while still maintaining that same hardcore dystopian feeling that the film does so well from the very first scene. So I'd recommend this film. It's a film with a lot of heart, intelligence and style, with great actors and an interesting premise. What more do you need?",Null,1,4,20 December 2012
Casino," Goodfellas in Las Vegas
","Martin Scorsese, Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci, Sharon Stone. Now there's a group of people with which to make a movie. Casino takes place in Las Vegas in the 70s. Sam 'Ace' Rothstein (De Niro) is sent to Vegas by the mob to run a casino for them. After a while they also send Nicky Santoro (Pesci) to keep the wheels running and to act as muscle for Rothstein. Unfortunately, these two have very different ideas on how things should be run. Ace would like nothing more than to run his casino, pay his 'honest' dues to the mob and to just sit back and relax. Whereas Nicky wants to climb all the way to the top, no matter how many bodies he has to leave on his wake.This movie is often compared to Goodfellas, Scorsese's previous masterpiece. And I can definitely see why. We have the mob, gangsters a plenty, rags to riches themes, and even two of the same actors, although Pesci is deservedly in a much bigger role this time around.And yet Goodfellas it ain't. It's plenty good on its own merits, but it lacks that degree of identifiability a proper old time gangster film has. The 70s and Las Vegas muddle up the story, make it seem that much dirtier. Drugs flow freely, no one can be trusted and none of the main characters is at all likable. Which is most definitely the point, but it is also the reason why I prefer Goodfellas. A much better comparison mood-wise would be Scarface, although that takes an even harsher stance on the viability of the gangster lifestyle. Whereas this movie is kind of half-n-half.Still, a good movie by any measure. Well worth a watch for all fans of the gangster genre.",Null,0,2,12 June 2018
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," Mythological
","Without a doubt, if you were to name films that changed culture the most or which ones defined culture the most, the original Star Wars would be there in the Top Ten, if not Top Three. A film by George Lucas, who took in influences ranging from spaghetti westerns to samurai films to classic fairy tales and crafted a film that would become the epitome of space opera genre. Since then it has inspired a following unlike almost anything we've ever seen before. Everyone raised in modern culture knows this film, knows what it's about and has probably seen it numerous times. And for a good reason.You can definitely see that while they were clearly ambitious about this film, they weren't shooting for the stars, nor did they have the best resources available. The special effects, while groundbreaking, innovative and very, very impressive, do show the limitations of the budget and would be greatly updated in the two coming sequels. For example, all the space explosions are kind of flaky, the lightsaber fight between Obi-Wan Kenobi and Darth Vader is in reality rather slow and looks cumbersome, the blaster bolts are obviously painted on the screen, and numerous other small things like that. In a way they add to the charm of the film, as do the corny dialogues, because really, it's not meant to be anything else but a pulp adventure and those need to be a bit cheesy to work.What the film does nail absolutely is the mythos. From the very first text scrawl to Obi-Wan talking about a more civilized age to all the mentions about the Jedi Order to a casual mention about the Galactic Senate, the film builds its world effortlessly and without flaws. There's a very good reason why people identify so strongly with this franchise and are so endlessly passionate about its intricacies, legends and lore. And this film is the one that started it all and laid all the groundwork for future films to utilize. I cannot in all honestly name any other film that can pull me in so quickly and have me begging more for crumbs of information.Star Wars is one of my favourite films of all time. Not because it's the perfect film by any means, but because of the way it inspires me, strengthens my imagination, allows me visions of faraway places and because it is one of the best adventure stories I've ever seen.",Null,1,2,26 November 2015
What We Do in the Shadows," One joke, but a funny one
","What We Do in the Shadows is a mockumentary, made exactly in the style of all those reality-TV documentaries that fill the day-time television. The ones that follow the lives of ordinary people, are filled with people talking on couches or in cars, don't really contain anything of substance and are just pointless projects to blow money on. Except that in this case we follow a household of vampires living in New Zealand. Oh, they still argue about dishes and cleaning, but they also have conversations about laying down newspapers before drinking from someone because it's such a pain to get blood out of the cushions, and lots more.And to be completely honest, that's about it. That's the one joke the film has. But it's a really funny one. All the different vampire clich√©s are examined and mocked through our main characters from the young rascal of the group, Deacon, who's only 183 years old, to good old Petyr, who's over 8000 years old and lives in a stone coffin in the basement. The film also contains some other mythological creatures and shamelessly makes fun of them as well.To be fair, the one joke starts to grow a bit stale towards the end. I think that the film makers purposefully wanted to end the film without anything too major happening, because that's how all those 'real' documentaries end, but it also means that there's not much of a story arc in the film. But, I was still chuckling at the joke even in the very end, so it didn't outlive its welcome. But it was a near thing.Still, the film is very much worth a watch if this is your kind of humour, which you should be able to surmise from what I've told you. If the idea is amusing to you, you're going to enjoy this film a lot.",Null,0,1,14 February 2017
Deadpool," Bad taste extragavanca
","I think most of us have been expecting this movie. Or at least something like it. A superhero film that is a bit more... I would say adult, but that doesn't quite fit. More willing to cross the line of good taste, a film willing to be gory, immature and full of adult humour, as well as brutal violence.And who better to embody the ideal of bad taste than Deadpool, the fourth wall breaking punkster of Marvel. He's pretty much what would happen if you gave a Looney Tunes character Wolverine's powers and removed the kid filter. And he's awesome because of it!Now, this is not actually Ryan Reynold's first time playing this character, as he also appeared in X-Men Origins: Wolverine, but the less said about that particular incident, the better. Suffice to say, they didn't treat the character kindly, and apparently Reynolds has always wanted to return back to the character and give him a movie worthy of his insanity. Well, mission accomplished. Deadpool is exactly the kind of movie it needs to be. It's ugly, hilarious, constantly veering between brutal violence, cringeworthy dark humour and the occasional somber moment, doesn't take itself at all seriously and is actually well-done movie in general terms as well. Especially because they crack jokes at the expense of the relatively cheap budget. Like the fact that they could only afford the licences of two very minor X-Men characters.If you like Deadpool, you're going to love this film. If you have no idea who I'm talking about, do go see the film if you like dark humour or the idea of an R rated superhero film. Because trust me, it earns that rating.",Null,11,23,7 June 2016
Ran," Shakespeare would be proud
","Akira Kurosawa returns to Shakespeare in this loose adaptation of King Lear that also incorporates elements from the legends of the daimy≈ç M≈çri Motonari. Or perhaps it would be more accurate to say that those two sources are eerily similar. An aging warlord (Tatsuya Nakadai) that has decided to retire and hand over the three great castles he has conquered during his bloody reign to his three sons, with the oldest named his successor and the head of the great house. But almost immediately the sons begin arguing among one another and soon the warlord finds himself dethroned and wandering the battlefields of the war his sons are waging.Quite like with his previous Shakespeare adaptation, Throne of Blood, Kurosawa delves deep into man's corruptibility and the taint of power in this film. Many of his films are at least somewhat heroic in nature and tone. Whereas the protagonist of this film, the warlord, is anything but. We learn throughout the course of the film that his life is a long tale of conquest, beaten down enemies, blood, fire and destruction. Yet Kurosawa achieves the very hard task of making him sympathetic despite all that. He obviously loves his sons and his anguish at seeing his life's work torn down in a matter of days is real and jarring.Perhaps it could even be said that his character is reflected in his sons. There's the oldest, the one with the power, pride and possessions, but who is brought low by those closest to him and stands on feet of clay. There's the schemer, the one willing to commit atrocities to get what he wants. And there's the youngest, who's the most driven by the love he has for his family, but who's also the one with the most difficulties in surviving the war-torn realm they live in.The film is also massive in scope, budget and length. Its themes are deep, its running time is closer to three hours and its story is a humongous five act monstrosity. It was also the most expensive Japanese film ever made back then and the money is definitely on the screen. Hundreds of soldiers at once on display, all of them decked in armour. Entire castles built and then destroyed. Lavish costumes, ruins and locations. I don't think I've seen a movie with this much handcraft on the screen since The Lord of the Rings trilogy. And this predates those films by almost two decades.Yet the film is always gripping, always interesting and endlessly fascinating. It's called one of Kurosawa's finest, and yeah, I can see why.",Null,0,1,30 June 2017
Cube," Creative paranoia, intense emotions
","It's great when film makers are willing to take chances with their premise, to truly step outside the norms of reality and invent something that could never exists - well, almost never. The premise of this film could technically exist today. You could be knocked out one day and then wake up in a cubic metal room with six doors, one on each surface, with no idea where you are, where to go or even why you are there. You won't, but you could and you're able to imagine what that would be like. It's an extreme situation where the horrors and wonders of human kind will be unleashed, and that's the beauty of this film. It's a fascinating character study of people but into a situation that none of them ever expected, but which has become a reality for them.The film is able to carry its story through mood and tone alone. The use of lighting, shadows and colours masterfully strengthens the claustrophobic atmosphere and the illusion of walls closing in. Add in the grinding sound effects, the heavy breathing and the whispered dialogues and you have a setting that's impossible to escape. You, the viewer, are in the Cube, along with its inmates.Probably the only thing holding this movie back is the fact that while it has a very imaginative premise, nothing definitive is said about the human condition. The inmates will panic, they will flee, they will triumph, only to fail again, and so on, but the final point of all this is never reached. Why was this story told? What did the film makers try to convey? In the end, I'm not sure, but at the same time I don't really care. The journey alone was more than enough, even if the final goal was kind of vague.Any fan of thrillers and psychological horror should see this film. It's an intense experience and capable of transporting you outside of your everyday life, into an unbearable situation from which there seems to be no escape.",Null,1,3,12 June 2013
Tarzan," *incoherent drooling due to the quality of the animation*
","This movie is gorgeous! It makes me wish I was a better poet so I could do it justice with words. It is the reason why man makes pictures with colours. I could take any single frame, especially any single background, hang it on my wall and be perfectly happy with it. It's¬Ö beautiful beyond words, beyond my ability to express it properly.It's also the end of an era. The last film of the Disney Renaissance. There are still good Disney films to come, but never again have we had such a streak of quality, of ambition and willingness to push the limits of what you can do with animation. And as far as I'm concerned, they could have done a lot worse than this film as a swan song. They took a relatively simple, yet classic book by Edgar Rice Burroughs, which is very clearly a product of its time, and updated it to the next millennium. A man raised in the jungles of Africa and meeting people like him for the first time in his life is a brilliant basic idea for a story and Disney utilizes it beautifully, giving us a tale full of excitement, interesting characters, emotions, adventure, plots and betrayals, love and learning, courage and above all understanding.They've also updated the characters a little bit. Tarzan isn't quite as masculine and demigod-ish as he is in the book, and Jane isn't just a damsel to be rescued. Jane's father, the professor, is essentially the same though, which isn't a problem as his role is rather minimal, whereas the gorillas have been given some actual roles and characteristics. Unfortunately they failed Clayton utterly as a character, which is the only real problem with the film. I get that they needed a clearly defined villain for the film, but they have made layered villains before. Judge Frollo and Scar, for example. Both were clearly the villains of their films, but they had complicated motivations and were willing to utilize every advantage they had. Clayton is simply a big white hunter with a huge gun. Nothing interesting about that.Plus I'm personally rather annoyed by Rosie O'Donnell's Terk, but that's just me. The character is objectively just fine.All in all Tarzan fails to reach that all around perfection movies such as Beauty and the Beast or The Lion King have, but it's still one of my favourite Disney films, and definitely one of the best looking. The music is also great, the characters are great - with one glaring exception - and overall it's definitely under-appreciated for its sheer quality.",Null,2,2,24 November 2015
Fast Five," The pinnacle of its franchise
","I think it's safe to say that it's Fast Five where The Fast and the Furious saga finally found its groove. It managed to keep all that was good about the franchise beforehand and combine it with the high stakes adrenaline rush of an international caper spy genre.The returning goodness still culminates in Paul Walker and Vin Diesel playing Brian O'Conner and Dominic Toretto, two street racing experts who are set to face the world no matter what it throws at them. Plus, you know, fast cars, hot women, killer soundtrack. All that good stuff. Plus Jordana Brewster as Mia Toretto. What's not to like.But then the new good stuff. First of all, Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson as a hardened federal agent going after Brian and Dom. Fantastic casting that allows you just that hint of incredulity. Because, you know, The Rock is larger than life.But this film also sees the return of many side characters from previous films. Gal Gadot as Gisele, Sung Kang as Han, Tyrese Gibson as Roman, and so on. All beloved characters, brought together at last to pull off a heist. Which was a great genre for this franchise to evolve into.If I had to gripe about something, I'd say the villain is really forgettable. And I'm not talking about Johnson's character. I'm talking about the mob boss, the target of the heist. Can't even remember his name. Still, he's not the most important part of the movie. Not even close.Fast Five is everything a good Fast & Furious film should be and then some. My personal favourite.",Null,0,0,17 May 2020
Green Book," Decent period drama
","Green Book, the Best Picture Academy Award Winner of 2018, is the story of Tony 'Lip' Vallelonga (Viggo Mortensen) and Don Shirley (Mahershala Ali). The latter being a celebrated African-American pianist and the former being the man hired to drive him around Southern USA. In the 60s, when racial separation was still very much enforced in those states.It is a good movie. A bit of a slow one, with a clear, easy to understand structure. But it's very much an actor's film, with most of the heavy lifting resting on its two main leads. Luckily, both of them are powerhouse actors, easily able to sell the complex emotions, frustrations and joys required to sell you, the viewer, this emerging friendship. Both were also nominated for an Academy Award for their performances, with Ali winning for Best Supporting Actor. Earned, I'd say.I call it an actor's film, but it's not like all the other aspects of a film were in any way lackluster. It's a well-shot, well-paced film with good dialogues, good music and good locations. Not a flashy movie by any means, but the craft is definitely there.All that being said, I don't think this was the best film of 2018. It's a good film, but quite honestly I found myself thinking that I had already seen many movies just like it as I walked out of the theatre. It's a feel-good movie about two people finding common ground despite their differences. With a healthy dose of race being thrown in. Does this lessen the movie's value? No, no at all. But I'd like to expect something extra from a Best Picture winner.Still, the movie is good, don't get me wrong. Definitely worth a watch if you're a fan of its genre.",Null,0,0,31 July 2019

","Spike Lee's newest film is an exploration of war, missed chances and modern day politics. In it a group of Vietnam War veterans return to Vietnam to look for a treasure they buried there during the war. On their journey we see flashbacks of their war experiences and explore their many, many regrets, losses and hindrances. Plus talk about what it means to be black back then as well as now.Spike Lee is a powerhouse behind the camera. This film is superbly shot. The story is told marvelously. Every scene felt necessary, every scene build on top of another. Likewise, the actors gave it their all and I liked the variance in the characters they portrayed. Each had scars from the war, but they all had dealt and were dealing with them differently.That being said, this film is political. It's really, really, really political. To some, that's one of its strengths. Lee does not pull any punches. He tells you what he thinks, as straight as he can. To some that means a lot. To me, a Nordic white man in my early 30s, it doesn't mean quite as much. Although I don't mind it. I didn't find it distracting nor did I find it unwarranted. It simply wasn't one of the cornerstones of the film.That being said, I can imagine that to Americans this film will have an impact. But even if you're from outside the US, the film has a lot to offer if you're looking to understand America as it is today and how it came to be like that. Especially when it comes to its black population.I can recommend the film. I can definitely recommend it.",Null,0,1,25 June 2020
Fantastic Four," Disappointing superhero bore
","This movie is one of the prime examples of how not to make a superhero movie. This was one of the first modern age films based on comic book superheroes, especially the ones from the Marvel universe. But let's look at the films that came before this one. Blade films had featured a dark, Gothic style and intense, bloody action scenes with a troubled antihero as the protagonist. The X-Men films were more colourful and suited for younger audiences, but even they dealt with topics such as discrimination and the dangers of having supernatural powers at your disposal. Did Fantastic Four try to replicate these feats? No, instead it tried to be as kid-friendly as possible. Because of this the action scenes have no power behind them, the characters are about as black and white as they come and the whole film is awash with bright colours and shiny gizmos.Not that there's anything wrong with making a kid-friendly action/adventure film, but even such a film needs to have decent characters and a good storyline. Kids aren't stupid and they deserve better stories than this. And I even think that the story isn't the biggest problem here, even though it ends up being nothing more than a grudge fight between to egoistical scientists. Rather the characters and their actors are at fault here. Reed Richards (Ioan Gruffudd) is a boring genius with no backbone. Susan Strom (Jessica Alba) looks amazing, but has no real characteristics, ending up being just the token chick of the group. Johnny Storm (Chris Evans) is a clich√©d whiner. And lastly Victor von Doom (Julian McMahon) is one those stereotypical 'must get back at my school rival, even though I'm one of the most powerful and richest men in the world and he's just a failed patent inventor' type of guys. The only character that might be called a good one is Ben Grimm (Michael Chiklis), perhaps because he actually faces a real personal dilemma, his problems have strength and soul behind them, thus making him sympathetic and relatable.And as stated, the story isn't anything special either. It amounts to nothing more than a petty rivalry between von Doom and Richards, which isn't all that exciting really, because there are no stages at play. Nothing substantial is threatened and because most of the protagonist are so boring, you don't really care whether they triumph or not. Sometimes in these cases a good villain might make the movie entertaining - rooting for the Galactic Empire and all that - but in this case that doesn't apply either.The film has some saving graces. Ben Grimm is surprisingly good character, as stated, and I actually liked the little subplot dealing with his love life as well. Plus the action, while pretty meaningless, is at least enjoyable to watch visually and the special effects in general aren't half bad, even by today's standards. They look fake nowadays, but in this regard the bright comic book style actually works for the movie's favour.So, my final verdict is that this is a pretty weak superhero film. It made some pretty lazy decisions in regards to the storyline and the visual style, plus its characters are not all that interesting. But it's bright and pretty and you might enjoy it if you're looking to turn off your brain and relax for an hour or two. It's not the worst superhero film I've ever seen, but it's way below average and I wouldn't recommend it.",Null,0,3,19 December 2012
The Great Escape," One of the greats of its genre
","World War Two rages on and in the occupied Poland a new prison camp has been built. A camp unlike anything that has been seen before. A camp to house all the worst jailbreakers the war has seen. But when such a group of clever and resourceful men are put together, what else can they do but attempt to escape.The film is based on true events, a true camp, and while there are some historical mishaps - not to mention outright tampering - it's still for the most part a rather accurate portrayal. The biggest change to the narrative is the addition of a couple of American prisoners, while in real life almost all of the prisoners were citizens of the Commonwealth. Quite honestly I didn't let it bother me.There's a lot of characters, but the film is of such quality that you learn all of their names and characters almost instantly. Perhaps the first few minutes you'll be a bit lost and then it's like you've known these men all your life. It helps that they all have their assigned, individual roles to help in the escape. There are forgers, scavengers, lookouts, misleaders, diggers and of course Richard Attenborough's Roger Bartlett as the Big X, the leader of the whole thing.The film has a lot of charm and is an excellent example of its genre. Especially because for once the film doesn't have to explain why we should root for the jailbreaker. Prisoners in a Nazi prison are automatically sympathetic.If I have a problem with the film, it would have to be with the final act. Without giving away too much, the film is based on true events and it sticks to those events. I can't blame it for that and it would have been an insult to change the events, but a part of me still wishes that the happy-go-lucky charm of the first acts could have been preserved.Oh well, such is life. And it's still a great film. Well worth a watch.",Null,0,0,26 September 2018
John Wick: Chapter 2," Why can't every action film be shot like this?
","Keanu Reeves returns as John Wick, a retired hitman, who is nevertheless pulled back into the world of assassins. The movie picks up only a few days after the events of the original film and we find Wick tying up some loose ends. But then a figure from his past comes to visit, intent on collecting a debt owed to him.And from there it's pretty much one action scene after another, with some quiet yet intent dialogue scenes thrown in to build the world and move the plot along. Pretty much like the first film. And I have to admit, I'm a huge fan. This is a really cool world they have built here, with clearly established rules, interesting characters and locations, and enough style to make The Godfather films weep.I also absolutely adore these action scenes. I love the wide takes that allow me to see everything that's happening in a given space. I love the long takes that don't break the harmony of movement. I love how they give each character their own unique feel. I love how John Wick is the epitome of minimization of movement. He kills people almost like it's an afterthought. And it looks so cool.Seeing a movie like John Wick 2 makes you dislike all the other action movies just a little bit. Because it shows you how well it can be done. And after you've seen it, it's hard to go back to those quick cuts and jittery camera movements.If you liked the original John Wick, this is more of the same while still feeling like it's continuing the story and being its own thing. If you haven't seen the original, go watch it if you would like to see one of the greatest action films made in the last two decades. And then come back to this one.",Null,1,2,22 March 2019
Annihilation," Basic scifi mystery with some decent imagery
","Based on Jeff VanderMeer's novel of the same name, Annihilation is the story of a group of women that are sent to investigate a mysterious meteor crash site, surrounded by what they have decided to call the Shimmer. But what awaits them at the lighthouse, the epicenter of it all?I have heard good things about the VanderMeet novel and some glimmer of that can be seen in this film. The various characters have interesting backstories, the weird mutations and acceleration of evolution caused by the Shimmer are equally interesting and look even better on the screen. Furthermore, there's some decent action, the actors are for the most part talented and there's nothing outright wrong with the film.And yet I cannot help but admit that I was disappointed. Mainly by the pacing, I'd say. For example, all the interesting backstories are gone over pretty much in a single scene and then they never play any part in the story, with a few very minor exceptions. I get that you have to trim away the fat when you're making an adaptation. But in that case don't allude to the fat that used to be there. Especially if you're going to be this blatant about the fact that you had to cut it because of time constraints.The ending is also pretty out there and doesn't make as much sense as it probably does in the novel, once again because of the lack of time and proper storytelling.That being said, the film looks very good, has some good imagery, some good scenes and overall it's not that bad. Not that great either, but at least I now want to check out the novel.",Null,0,2,23 September 2018
Jackie Brown," Perhaps the most subtle movie from Tarantino
","I don't think Tarantino has ever directed a movie with less gunfights, blood and gore, which is by no means a bad thing. Jackie Brown is more style than action, but it's still unerringly Tarantino. Everything from the music to the dialogue to the characters is pure him. It's simply more of a thriller instead of an action film.The eponymous Jackie Brown (Pam Grier) is an airline stewardess who, as means to make more money, smuggles drugs and cash for Ordell (Samuel L. Jackson), a fairly successful drug lord. A deal goes sour and Jackie needs to do one last big job for Ordell to preserve her life. Things get complicated when a bondsman Max Cherry (Robert Forster) develops feelings for Jackie. The rest is great conversations, intriguing characters, style, class, some violence and a really good criminal masterplan. Tarantino in a nutshell.Neither Grier or Forster had acted in a leading role for a long time before this film and this movie helped revitalize their careers. And not undeservedly so. Grier especially is phenomenal in her role and this movie is considered to be one of the best action/thriller films with a female protagonist. She's resourceful, tough as nails and quick on her feet, but she's also way in over her head, but making it work for her. Great character, one of Tarantino's best.Jackie Brown is largely a con job film, so I shall say no more in fear of spoiling it for you, but trust me when I say that it's well worth a watch, whether you are a fan of Tarantino or not.",Null,1,1,7 May 2015
Monty Python and the Holy Grail," Comedy masterpiece
","Probably the most well-known work of the British comedy troupe Monty Python, next to Life of Brian. It has endured for almost three decades now and is still considered to be one of the best comedies ever made. And for a good reason. Everything that made Monty Python great is present in this film, their first full-length feature film: the absurd situations, the clever wordplays, the willingness to stretch joke as far as needed, the hilariously incompetent characters, the nonplussed deliveries, the whole package.What separates this film from many modern comedies is its intelligence and poise. Certainly some of the humour is a touch lowbrow and/or silly, but some of it is extremely intelligent and depends on the viewer being able to follow the situation and the dialogues. I also enjoy how they've managed to reach the feel of Arthurian times through costuming and illustrations. Most of the humour is also patently absurd. And yet it all fits together strangely well. One of the hallmarks of British comedy is stoic delivery. The characters never think they're saying something funny, rather they just happen to live in this bizarre world. There's never a sense of winking at the audience with this group, which is much better in my opinion.This is my favourite comedy film by far. It's very quotable, every single joke makes me at least crack a smile, the whole story is strangely compelling and as a whole it's just a blast to sit through every now and then. A beloved classic for a reason. See it. Arthur, your king, compels you!",Null,1,4,11 July 2014
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," One of the best sequels ever
","Unlike so many unplanned sequels to standalone movies that don't know what to do with themselves, Star Wars Episode V pulls ahead like a champ. It does it by taking the existing universe, expanding it in a logical manner, staying with what worked in the previous film yet adding something new and original as well. You can definitely see that they hadn't planned for this film in advance because there's a lot of new stuff. Suddenly we have the character of Yoda, the reveal of Luke's father, the romantic tension between Han and Leia (you can see pretty well in the first film that she was supposed to end up with Luke) and the continuation of the war between the Alliance and the Empire.But, unlike in so many other sequels, in this case it works because the film makers hadn't painted themselves into a corner with the first film. There was still story left from the original to explore. The Emperor hadn't been dealt with, it was possible that Darth Vader might have survived the destruction of the first Death Star and Luke still had much to learn about the Force. And thus we get a film that might be one of the best sequels ever made, if not one of the best movies in general.The film is also a significant leap forward in terms of technical quality. They had a much bigger budget with this film, plus more experience with the new effects the first film had pioneered, and it shows. From Darth Vader's improved armor and look to the explosions and the spaceships to the lightsaber battles. They all look fantastic and have held up remarkably well over the decades.Furthermore, the story is just as good as in the first one. The Battle of Hoth that opens the film might very well be one of my favourite battle scenes in all of cinema and the lightsaber duel near the end of the film is easily the best one in all of the franchise. Plus, we get a lot of new stuff, as stated, and they all work very well. Yoda's puppetry effects have not aged as well as some other effects in the film, but they're still pretty impressive even by today's standards and the character itself is a lot of fun. Kind of Jar Jar done right. You know, a crackpot local (I know he's not really from Dagobah, shut up) alien who talks funny, messes around, but is still needed for the plot. Except in Yoda's case there's some actual wisdom beneath the initial goofiness.Overall I think I prefer Episode IV to this one, but it's by a very slight margin. This one has better battles, better effects and equally great story, but Episode IV had better atmosphere and sense of mythos. Nevertheless, they're both fantastic scifi epics and well worth a watch if you've been living under a rock for the last half a century.",Null,1,2,29 November 2015
Aladdin," Animation entertainment perfected
","Aladdin has a long and illustrious legacy. It was a massive hit upon its release, garnering critical acclaim and box office successes one after another. It's still considered to be one of the finest animated films ever made, probably even the best Disney film of all time if not for the film that came directly after it, The Lion King, and it also carries the dubious honour of being the unofficial first Dreamworks film. At least in spirit. Because really, think about it. The jokey mood, the pop culture references, the scope and size of the songs. Aladdin even has that abominable Dreamworks lead character smirk on his face.Not that any of this lessens the quality of the film in any way. This is a magnificent, huge film, one of my ultimate favourites. I love it, I absolutely love it. Everything in it. Aladdin, Jasmine, the fact that they're the best Disney couple by a comfortable margin. They just click instantly and the bazaar scene with the apple is probably one of the finest in the whole film, and that's saying something. And the rest of them as well. Genie, the carpet, Jafar, the whole crew. I also really love that back then they could make movies such as these. Could you imagine them doing a movie like this, with an all-Arabic cast and setting, nowadays? It'd be a horror show.The story is also probably the finest adventure story I've ever seen in an animated film, in any film really. It establishes its premise and basic story effortlessly, is immensely enjoyable and easy to follow, yet contains massive depth through its hinted backstory and its characters. A film you can watch over and over, and still enjoy it just as much as you did the first time. And you know we did watch it, over and over again, as children. And yet it's just as good now, when I rewatched it as an adult. Better even, because you finally get why Aladdin and Jasmine click so well, why Aladdin's final ploy against Jafar was the only one possible and oh so very clever, and why the Genie is such a good, tragic character.You all know this movie. You've all probably seen it multiple times already. But, if you haven't watched it recently, if the last time you saw it was as a child, do rewatch it if you get the chance. You'll be surprised at what you're going to discover within.",Null,1,2,20 October 2015
Incredibles 2," More of the same
","After fourteen years, Brad Bird returns to his spy/superhero mix. The film picks up immediately after the events of the original film, which is admittedly something you don't see every day, but at the same time I also feel that it constrains the film, forces it into a cubicle.The film looks and feels almost exactly like the original. Which is great. The colours are still phenomenal, the 60s spy thriller aesthetic is still superb and a refreshing change of pace, the characters feel familiar and the even though the special effects and animation quality have definitely gone up in fourteen years, the transition is pretty much seamless.What I don't appreciate as much is the fact that this is almost exactly the same movie as the original one. At least in terms of theme, plot, character arc and underlying message. Once again we have superheroes under scrutiny. Once again Mr. Incredible has to juggle family duties with his consuming need of being a hero. And so on and so on, ad nauseam.And certainly, a lot of sequels are very similar to their predecessors. But I think it's safe to say that we can expect more from Pixar. And more from Brad Bird. The man has reportedly said that he didn't want to make a sequel to The Incredibles unless he had something new to tell. Well... this isn't new. You can definitely watch it and appreciate it for its technical excellence, its great characters and its thrilling story. But you don't get anything from it. Nothing you haven't gotten from the original, that is. And I don't like that. This film universe has so much potential for great and meaningful stories that it's a great shame to see it wasted like this.Still, it's by no means a bad film. It is enjoyable to watch and as a standalone film I do like it a lot. As a sequel it leaves much to be desired.",Null,1,3,4 October 2018
The Cabin in the Woods," Absolute blast
","Five college kids - the jock, the party girl, the innocent girl, the hippie and the nerd - all decide to spend a holiday on a remote cabin, swimming, grilling, drinking, all around partying. Yet all is not as it seems.Sound familiar? Yes, it's the done-to-death, classical B-horror movie plot about young adults getting into trouble, with lots of gore, screaming and the dumb blond always dies first. Am I right? And dare I guess that you honestly couldn't care less about another one? Luckily for you, this film is not just another B-horror movie. It's all that and more. With The Cabin in the Woods, director Joss Whedon delves into one of his all time favourite genres, yet he's not content just directing a really good scream fest. He knows the genre inside out, he knows all the tricks, all the clich√©s, all the conventions, and just like with Buffy the Vampire Slayer, he wants to take all these and turn them upside down while still staying true to them.I cannot really say it otherwise, this movie is amazing. It plays all the clich√©s right from the very start, except when it suddenly veers into the exact opposite direction, only to immediately pounce back when you least expect it. It's a constantly surprising, constantly thrilling and constantly exciting roller coaster of jokes, hidden meanings, lampshade hangings and parodies. And yet it's a fine horror movie in its own right. It's that and more.And that's pretty much all I can say about the movie without spoiling your fun. On the technical side of thing, I have no complaints. It's well-acted, well-shot, well-produced film, but its biggest value lies in its vision, its idea that's all Whedon. Trust me, if you're a fan of horror, you owe it to yourself to watch this film. You've never seen anything quite like it.",Null,1,4,8 January 2014
Spectre," Stumbles a little bit, but still a good addition to the Bond films
","Daniel Craig is back as James Bond and this time the stakes are higher than ever before because this time Bond will finally face off against the elusive Spectre, the criminal master society that has haunted him for years. This confrontation has been a long time coming and we couldn't have been more hyped as viewers.Unfortunately, what we end up getting doesn't quite live up to that hype. Following the recent trend of trying to tie multiple separate films together to form a larger cohesive universe, it tries to explain all the previous Craig Bond films as having been leading up to this, but the harsh truth is that there were almost no signs of this in the previous films. Thus this attempt feels forced and tagged on. Granted, it does a good job of explaining how all of it could have been intertwined, and it is definitely made to sound plausible, but it's still not as convincing as it should have been.Furthermore, the film is a long one. Too long, in fact. There is about half an hour's worth of material that could have been cut very easily, giving us a more streamlined and well-paced film. Now I felt exhausted at the end.And the third big complaint I have is that Christoph Waltz is underutilized. He has presence, certainly, but he is in very few scenes and the script does him no favours, perhaps expecting him to be even more naturally creepy than he has the ability to be. And don't get me wrong, Waltz can be very creepy, but not to the extent that it doesn't matter at all how you have him act or speak.But then, the good stuff. And there's a lot of it here. The opening sequence, first of all, is phenomenal. One of the best I've seen in any Bond film. The long, continuous shots, the action, the visuals. Phenomenal. The returning actors are also at the top of their came, with Craig once again giving us a more tainted but still very believable Bond, fitting for this new age of technology, glass and steel. And most of the new actors are also very good. L√©a Seydoux is very good as the new Bond Girl Dr. Madeleine Swann. Sure, the age difference between her and Craig is a bit extreme, but aside from that. She's definitely on the more snarkier side, which I like a lot, and has a very sharp, fragile edge to her, which I also like. And then we have Dave Bautista as Mr. Hinx, who just might be my absolute favourite Bond henchman ever. Dude looks amazing, has great physical presence, has style in spades and is genuinely threatening whenever he appears. Plus he doesn't need words to convey his message.The action scenes are also up to bar, easily so in fact, the music works very well, the film genuinely looks beautiful and has some of the best shots we've seen so far in any Bond film.All in all Spectre is not as good as Casino Royale or Skyfall. It feels a bit lost when it comes to its story and doesn't quite have that edge those two had. It's still a good addition to the franchise and well worth a watch if you're a fan.",Null,0,3,2 December 2015
Moon," Not quite original enough
","Sam Bell (Sam Rockwell) is a worker on the Moon, nearing the end of his three-year shift. His job is a lonely one. He's the sole occupant of a station built to monitor the humongous harvesters scouring the face of the Moon. But then he injures himself in an accident and things start to get weird.Moon has a good premise. The basic idea of its plot is an interesting one. Unfortunately the execution leaves something to be desired. And I think a lot of that is due to Rockwell. He's a pretty smarmy guy in appearance and general demeanour. And that alone is not necessarily the problem, although it makes it a bit more difficult to root for his characters.The problem, which might also be because of the script, is how nonchalantly he takes all the weird stuff that starts to happen at the station. Sure, he eventually reacts, but it's delayed, weirdly enough. Perhaps they were going for shock or something like that, but it's still odd to expect a story beat, a reaction, that never really comes.To the film's credit, it is very well filmed and made. The production design is fantastic and makes the whole film look really good. One of the more realistic looking five-minutes-into-the-future scifis I've seen recently.Moon has its upsides. And if you can stomach Rockwell better than I can, you might have something really great here. In any case I think you ought to give the film a chance.",Null,0,0,28 November 2019
Her," Beautiful vision of the near future
","What if artificial intelligence has become a reality and instead of the Skynet scenario where we end up waging a war against our new robot overlords, we end up simply co-existing with them, in peace. Sound boring? I can assure you, it's not. Her is an astonishingly captivating tale of a man who finds himself lonely and decides to buy a new operating system for his computer. An operating system that just happens to be an artificial intelligence.This movie rides heavily on the acting chops of Joaquin Phoenix and Scarlett Johansson. Fortunately both of them are phenomenal and even though most of the scenes show Theodore (Phoenix) simply talking into empty air and Samantha (Johansson) is nothing more than a voice in a machine, they're still great scenes because the two simply have great chemistry together. Johansson especially is a phenomenon. She's everything a flesh and blood actor would be, only using her voice. She skips from playful to profound to thoughtful to sad with such skill that it's hard to imagine anyone else pulling it off as well.I also have to praise the ending. It's not what you'd expect, but it feels right. Movie such as this one, where the conflict is one of deep philosophy and human existence, was always going to be hard to end in a way that feels satisfying, but Her pulls it off seemingly effortlessly.Her jumped straight into one of my favourite movies of all time. It's a nigh perfect mix of humour, drama, emotions and science fiction. Recommended to every single one of you out there.",Null,0,1,8 November 2014
Mad Max: Fury Road," Adrenaline injected straight into your veins, and also your heart
","After three decades we finally get another Mad Max film, and from the original director to boot. And if we learned anything from Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, it is that these kind of movies are to be feared. Which is why it's my great surprise and pleasure to announce that Mad Max: Fury Road is not only amazing, it comes very close to being the best Mad Max we've ever had.Couple of reasons for this. First of all, it is an unbelievable action film. Eighty percent of the whole running time is spent in one kind of action sequence or another, but the directing and the pacing are both so iron tight that you'll never feel overwhelmed. I was at the edge of my seat the whole film, biting my nails, trying to rein in the urge to leap to my feet and yell 'Oh yeah!' It also helps that this movie is one of those rare movies nowadays that are confident enough to utilize practical effects where they can and only rely to CGI when the effect is impossible to replicate in real life. And that shows. You really believe that all the cars are there and that the explosions really happen. It's a nuanced difference, but we see so much CGI these days that we've become able to spot the difference.The actors are also phenomenal. Tom Hardy is perfect as the new Max. Sure, he doesn't have the underlying suave charisma Mel Gibson had, but this is a more jaded Max we're seeing in this film, and Hardy is perfect for that. But the real breakthrough performance here has to be Charlize Theron as Imperator Furiosa. I demand more action roles for this woman! She's everything someone portrayed as Max's equal has to be, and then some. Undeniably badass, utterly skilled and frightening in her fury, she's one of the best action heroines we've ever seen, if not the best. More, please.And thirdly, the surprising depth and emotions shown in this film. And yes, the themes are largely feminine. It deals with subjects like forced pregnancy, slavery, treating women as objects to be owned, fear, suffering and loss. All this in the middle of the most straightforward action gorefest you've ever seen. Yet the thing is, the themes never take away from the action. It wouldn't be a better action movie if you dropped the themes away or replaced them with something more 'masculine'. It works precisely because it can be a movie for both the adrenaline junkie muscleheads and for those looking hope and redemption in cinema.And that is why Mad Max: Fury Road is so great. Because it pulls of the miracle of not only being a fourth part in a franchise thought having died a long time ago, but also being a movie about humanity, redemption and equality, while also being the movie most likely to cause per-pubescent boys to drop their voices by two octaves.",Null,0,14,27 July 2015
Warcraft," Now this is a all-out fantasy film
","This film makes me smile. I mean, when they announced they were going to make it, and especially after seeing the first trailer, I couldn't believe what I was witnessing. The Warcraft games are... such nerdy games. I mean, they feature all kinds of overblown fantasy races engaging in war eternal against one another, each of them extremely silly in a way that only geeks and nerds can really appreciate. And the film seemed to reflect that perfectly. Had the nerd culture really penetrated our society so thoroughly that a film like this could succeed.Yes, yes it has. This film is exactly like the games. I mean sure, there's far more plot than in the games, it's not just battle scene after battle scene - thank the heavens - but it's still instantly recognizable and remains extremely faithful to the story and, most of all, spirit of the games.So yeah, if you're not familiar with the games or at least bulk fantasy style in general, there's a moderate to high chance that you're going to feel a bit lost. It's filled with exotic names, weird creatures, vast landscapes and lore so deep that even I as a hardcore nerd despair at knowing it all. It certainly works as a generic action adventure fantasy, but the lure of it is in its faithfulness to the games. And the visuals, I suppose, though the film relies very heavily on CGI, like it really has to with the visuals themselves being so outlandish.So yeah, I thoroughly enjoyed this film. Sure, the plot is clunky, the characters clich√É¬©d (though the actors actually managed to pull almost all of them off beautifully), the visuals silly at times and overall I can definitely see that it's not for everyone. But for fans of the genre, it's something we've never seen before. Something I personally didn't believe we'd ever see.",Null,0,0,26 October 2016
Gladiator," Epic historical drama
","What I love the most about this film is how it transports me directly to the Era of Ancient Rome in all of its glory. The sheer scope of this film is awe-inspiring, from the brutal battle scenes against the barbarians, to the slave markets of the Middle-East to the Colosseum of Rome. It all looks, sounds and feels real, and the era has never been more accurately represented.This is also one of Russell Crowe's crowning achievements. He fully disappears into the role of General Maximus, aptly portraying both the brilliant military leader, the anguished family man after revenge as well as the beacon of hope for the people of Rome. The story of Gladiator is his story, and a bad casting choice would have ruined the whole film. In this case it elevates it to a masterpiece territory.The rest of the actors do a fine job as well, though I've never quite gotten the appeal of Joaquin Phoenix, playing here the corrupted emperor Commodus. He's fine villain objectively, but I think he's perhaps a shade too slimy with very little charisma. I get that's the purpose, but I would have preferred a villain with a hint more backbone. Still, only a nitpick.Aside from that, it's an all-around great film with intense and well-choreographed fight scenes, interesting characters, high production values and great use of both music and colour. It's no wonder they're still talking about the soundtrack of this film.Do you like action, historical dramas or pretty much anything with convincing characters and great storytelling? Then this film is for you.",Null,0,0,13 January 2014
Contact," Excellent film about the spirituality of science
","Contact, based on Carl Sagan's novel of the same name, encourages us to question what it would truly mean if we found out that we might not be alone in the universe. Oftentimes it's seen as though the only people who would be called to handle such a discovery would be the leading scientists and the politicians. Contact argues that the scope would be much larger than that, because the impact of finding that we did not evolve alone nor were we created alone would affect us on all levels, both rational and spiritual.And for the most part the film handles these ideas and questions very well. The story is told from the point of view of Eleanor Arroway (Jodie Foster), who is one of the foremost astronomers in the world and who has taken it upon herself to search for signs of extraterrestrial life. And one day she hears a signal in the darkness of space, a signal that cannot have come from any human source. Coded within that signal the human race finds blueprints for a machine.The film takes great cares to keep the religious aspect of this discovery relevant to the plot. Matthew McConaughey's character Palmer Joss, a renowned Christian philosopher, is central in this undertaking, but personally I find his constant presence somewhat problematic from the point of view of the story because he's often railroaded back into the plot to spout his point of view and opinions. The film needs him to explore its themes, but he is handled somewhat clumsily as a character, thus making his message less effective.I'm also one of those people that really don't like the ending. And there are people that absolutely love it, but it's one of those endings that divides opinions left and right. I find it to be overly sentimental and to undermine the overall message of hope and discovery the movie has. But then again, some people find the biggest source of hope to be the ending itself and they like how the film gives the choice for them to decide what they want to believe. Bottom line being that you have to see the film and decide what you think about it.Contact is a fantastic science fiction film. It's got one of the greatest minds of the century behind its story, making it far deeper and thought-provoking than almost any film of its genre. I personally dislike some of Sagan's tenets, but I cannot dismiss the thought he has put into them. And that makes this film more than worthy of being watched and appreciated.",Null,1,3,17 July 2015
Donnie Darko," I've been lead to believe that the director's cut would have been better
","I can see the attraction behind this film, the main idea the film makers were trying to accomplish, their vision. It's supposed to be a film that combines complex time travel ideas and philosophy with eerie dark comedy and teenage love drama. And on the paper it's not a bad idea. The main character Donnie Darko (Jake Gyllenhaal) gets told that he doesn't have long on this earth, while he simultaneously has to question his very sanity and even his existence. This is shown to have the effect of releasing him from his bonds, allowing him to express himself in ways he has never before realized. In a way you could say that he was happier during that final month or so than he was ever before. Except that he's constantly plagued by the knowledge of what might come. The film's atmosphere is very dark, with muted colours and uncomfortable, yet occasionally sweet scenes.So what went wrong? The time travel aspect mostly. The thing about a plot device as complex as time travel is that it pretty much always requires a lot of explanation to pull off. The audience needs to know why something travels through time, what caused it. In Back to the Future it's explained to be the work of a brilliant scientist. In The Terminator it's future technology. Sometimes it's magic. In Donnie Darko it sort of just happens, which is always a terrible choice. Some films get away with it through the use of humour - the randomness of it is dismissed with a shrug. Donnie Darko however spends a significant amount of its running length talking about the methodology of time travel, yet explaining very little. And this is immensely frustrating, because either we should be receiving information or we should be doing something else. Of course a mystery left open is sometimes a valid plot device, but it needs to be brought into the story just right or it ends up being frustrating, like in this case. Though to be fair I've read that the director's cut is better in this aspect, so perhaps there's still hope for this movie.Aside from that major aspect, I think the movie's OK. I'm not crazy about any of the performances, but the main actors are good at what they do. Gyllenhaal especially is very believable in his role, even though he comes off very detached and nonplussed. In this case I believe it's deliberate and he shows emotions in the right places, so it works. On the technical side of things I have no complaints. It's not the best looking film I've ever seen, but it's solidly slight above average, which is more than enough, considering that this movie is mainly about the idea behind it rather than how the idea is brought to the screen.In the end I have to find this to be an average film, perhaps slightly above average. That's only the theatrical cut, though mind you. Had they explained the time travel any better and had they really focused on the complexity of Darko's situation, this could have been an amazing film. And it's entirely possible that the director's cut could be just that. Now it's a bit too open ended, a bit too non-explanatory, to really pull me in. Still worth a watch, but nothing spectacular.",Null,0,0,17 April 2013

It's a Disney film. I don't think ancient Chinese warriors were lead into battle by tiny dragons who sounded like Eddie Murphy. Neither do I think that Ancient Greece was the birthplace of gospel music.The fact that the story took liberties with the source material is no reason to dismiss a Disney film. On the other hand, the fact that the story itself has some major problems, is.But, even though this film is pretty much the most hated of the Disney Renaissance films, it did get a lot of things right as well. There are no mountains in the Eastern USA, but they sure do look pretty as the backgrounds of this film. The animation is all around flawless. The more simplistic character models take a minute to get used to, but after that they look very good. The songs are also very good, with Colors of the Wind being one of my all-time favourite Disney songs. And even though the Native American shown here don't bear as much resemblance to the real thing as some would like them to, I always thought they were pretty cool. They had a flourishing civilization going on, yet it was clearly different from the European one. They were fearless warriors and the movie shows these two peoples as equals, both in their capacity for good as well as for evil. That's a very good lesson to teach to children.But unfortunately the story isn't one of Disney's better ones. It's too simplistic, too safe, too what you'd expect. Most of the other Renaissance films took chances, delving into some rather dark places in the process. They weren't simply cookie cutter films produced to make money. I don't get that feeling from Pocahontas. Because, when you get down to it, what's the most basic plot an animated film could tell if you had to tell a story about the colonization of America? Easy, you say. An early pioneer comes to America from Europe, meets a cute Indian girl, the two sides resist, tensions rise, but of course eventually you'll have your happy ending. Well¬Ö that's Pocahontas.And they had so many options to go with. They could have shown us time, even years, passing as these two peoples slowly learned to tolerate each other, with Pocahontas and John Smith working as the bridge. They could have increased the amount of supernatural, now we only have Grandmother Willow. They could have drawn inspiration from actual Native American legends and myths. Anything but this poor man's Romeo and Juliet.Nevertheless, I do think it's a good film. Sure, the characters and the story are not as good as they could have been, but they're still good enough. And, as stated, the production values and technical aspects are pretty much flawless. Not deserving of its scorn, would be my final word.",Null,0,1,10 November 2015
The Social Network," Great acting movie
","In some ways I do think this film was made a bit early. Facebook isn't that old a phenomenon, and thus a movie about its origins seems rushed as I don't think we have enough distance to view it objectively. That being said, David Fincher has pulled off some miracles here and I think this is about as perfect a movie about Facebook as was possible to be made. Some of its events and depictions can be argued with and you can definitely see that sometimes things are stretched in the name of drama, but as a story it works really well and will definitely give you some perspective on the web page most of us have come to rely on.And at the centre of it all is Mark Zuckerberg played by Jesse Eisenberg in probably his best role performance so far. Zuckerberg is a great character. From the very first scene, where he's talking with his college girlfriend, you get this guy. He's a genius and in his case it's also a burden, a curse. He's in a constant state of frustration because to him everyone else seems to be moving in slow-motion. Everyone is always one or two steps behind and he has to slow done to let them catch up.The movie deals with Zuckerberg's days in college while he was getting Facebook off the ground and with the legal battles that he had to go through later because everyone tried to stake their claim on the pot of gold he had founded. The movie is good at not taking sides and showing that while Zuckerberg certainly did some slightly questionable things, it's not like the other side was completely in the right either.All in all The Social Network is worth a watch because it has great actors lead by a great director and the subject matter is something we're all familiar with and know personally. Best film of the year? Probably not, but it's up there.",Null,0,0,23 February 2016
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," The best of the trilogy
","Once again Dr. Indiana Jones, tomb raider extraordinaire, has to fight back against the rising Nazi threat. This time the stakes are even higher for the Axis of Darkness is after the Holy Grail, a fountain of eternal youth, and they have also taken his father, who has quested after the Grail his entire life.In many ways this is very similar to Raiders of the Lost Ark. We have Nazis, a Judeo-Christian artifact to save, mostly European and Middle-Eastern locations, tough as nails love interest, and so on. And yet it is different enough and even better enough that these small similarities don't drag the movie down. It's one of those few sequels where it's strengths are both its similarities and its differences from the original classic.And there are more than a few good reasons for it. First of all, there's Sean Connery playing the role of Henry Jones Sr. and he is fantastic. Charismatic, wise, a bit kooky in an academic manner and a clear template for what would be Indiana Jones. What's more, his chemistry with Harrison Ford allows us to see a new side of Indy. There's bitterness between the two, but also respect, dependence and love. Ford has always been the shining star of these movies, and here even more so.Second of all, Spielberg keeps on improving upon his craft. Watching these movies back to back, you can see that Raiders has a few bumps here and there as they were still learning the character and even the very genre. Nothing major, it's still a fantastic movie, but in my opinion The Last Crusade is the superior film. It is a nigh flawless adventure film no matter how you want to look at it. The only way to make it better would have been to bring back Marion Ravenwood (Karen Allen) and make her even more of a badass than she was before.But even without her we have chases, fist fights, libraries, tombs, ancient mysteries and even something mythical lurking just over the horizon. One of my favourite movies of all time and a great watch no matter how many times you've already seen it.",Null,0,0,7 July 2017
Back to the Future," Fantastic
","I recently celebrated October 21, 2015 by re-watching the Back to the Future trilogy. And they were amazing. I had quite honestly forgotten just how good they were, just how funny, innovative, crazy, fast and quotable. And this is the one that started it all, and is easily the best film in the whole trilogy, which is saying a lot, keeping in mind the utter amount of quality all of them have.We all know the story. Dr. Emmett Brown (Christopher Lloyd) has invented a time machine, and wants his young friend Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) to act as a witness for the first trial run. But things don't go as planned - do they ever - and Marty is flung back into the past where he has to figure out how he can get, you guessed it, back to the future. Great, amazing basic story, but what really makes this one of the most iconic time travel films ever made is the amount of detail they put into the world and the characters. The very first scene, for example, of Marty stepping into Doc's house looking for him is filled with vast amounts of little touches that all tell a story, both about Doc and Marty.And the movie just keeps going. All of the characters are very memorable and just the right amount of over the top and exaggerated. From Marty's ultimate wimp of a father George (Crispin Glover) to Biff (Thomas F. Wilson), who's such a massive Hollywood bully that it's a wonder he hasn't spontaneously combusted from sheer stereotypicality. But all that's part of the fun and the characters are played so well and the movie is so light in tone that their over the topness actually works for the film's advantage.The score by Alan Silvestri is also fantastic, one of the most iconic movie soundtracks in cinema history. Whenever the main theme blasts from the screen you're flung straight into an adventure. The special effects are also surprisingly decent. Sure there are some obvious computer effects, but they were very good for their time and luckily the film relies mostly on practical effects.Saying anything more would frankly spoil the movie too much. But trust me when I say that this is one of the finest adventure films ever made. It's cinema enjoyment distilled into its purest form. It's a sin I hadn't seen it in such a long time. A mistake which shall not be made again.",Null,2,2,4 November 2015
The Bourne Supremacy," Very good sequel
","I still remember the first Bourne film fondly. It took the premise of James Bond, kept the larger than life spy thriller aspect intact, while bringing it closer to ground, so to speak. Instead of a suave English ladykiller gentleman, we have an amnesiac American, who feels much more an everyman. It was a good formula, and the film certainly left an impact.Which is why I'm pleased to say that the sequel comes pretty close to matching the original. The story picks up sometime after the events of the original. Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) and his girlfriend, Marie Kreutz (Franka Potente), have successfully evaded capture so far and are enjoying their life in India. That is until Bourne is once again pulled back into the world of espionage.I like that the film feels like it's continuing the story. So many sequels try to retell the exact same story, but in this it feels like they had a completely new story to tell. The events of the original are not ignored and the progression of both characters and events feels natural. Sure, there is a touch of maintaining the status quo, but not in a way that feels forced.The characters are also really good once again. I would have liked to see more of Marie, but that is largely made up by the presence of Pamela Landy (Joan Allen), a high-ranking CIA operative, who's looking for Bourne. Very much an MVP of the film.That being said, I have to admit that the original film had better action scenes and was sleeker all around. The action scenes in this are not bad, but the film suffers heavily from shaky-cam. Plus, the villains are paper thin and/or cartoonish. Not that the villains in the original very all that great, but they were at least passable.Nevertheless, if you liked The Bourne Identity, this is very much worth a watch.",Null,0,0,11 June 2018
Warm Bodies," So... this is a thing
","The zombie apocalypse has come and a group of young survivors have left the safety of their walled community in order to search for supplies. Naturally the zombies attacks and our young female heroine's boyfriend gets eaten. At which point the movie decides to become a romantic comedy as the boyfriend-eating zombie in question decides that he's in love with her and promptly takes her back home with him.After that the film can do pretty much anything and it would be acceptable because it has already veered so far off the beaten track. And although the film doesn't go outright bat guano insane, it does contains some really weird scenes, which all still meld together rather well. The movie has a logic of its own it follows, even if that logic is so weird.The actors are also rather good. Special mention should go to Nicholas Hoult who manages to pour such presence into the lifeless corpse he plays. His zombie character plays all the zombie notes correctly, moaning, grunting and stiffly walking around, yet you can still somehow read a lot of emotions from his rotting face. This is at least partially helped by the fact that we get to follow his inner monologue, which in itself is one of the best parts of the movie, especially because Hoult's delivery is surprisingly well- suited for dry comedy.All that being said, the ending is rather disappointing. You can see it coming by looking at the film's overall tone, but it's still so filled with sugary fluff that I swear it gave me new cavities. I'm not saying the ending should have been filled with gore and suffering, but a modicum of moderation would have been appreciated.Still, not a bad film to check out if you're looking for a zombie movie that's different.",Null,0,0,16 January 2017
Princess Mononoke," Life-affirming art
","The magnum opus of director Hayao Miyazaki and one of the if not the best animation movie ever made. A film that children can watch no doubt, but which still deals with the themes of loss, sacrifice, the non-existent line between good and evil, war, death and the dying state of divinity and spirituality. It's a heavy movie, yet it's never so excessively dark and brutal that you couldn't show it to a twelve-year- old.For me, this is one of those perfect movies that you have the honour of coming across every once in a while. Because it's really hard to find any faults in this movie.The animation?

The clash between the spirits of the forest and the civilization of man is the central focus of the film, but you very quickly realize that neither of those sides is in the wrong. They both have reasons for their actions, for defending what they see as theirs. The methods of both are at the same time commendable and questionable. Name one other movie where you've seen anything similar.

Alien: Covenant," The bridge between Prometheus and the Alien franchise
","Ridley Scott once again returns to the Alien franchise, this time focusing on the events after the film Prometheus. Some years have passed and once again a spaceship full of ignorant travellers land on a planet where they really shouldn't.These prequel films have gathered their fair amount of hate from the fans of the original films. And I can understand why. They change things. Ridley Scott of course always had some idea about where the xenomorphs came from or what they really were, but it was never talked about in the originals. Because it wasn't necessary. And there was an elegance to that, which is lost in these prequels as things and mythos get thicker and thicker.And yet I do admire these newer films for undertaking the task of trying to explain, and explain in a way that would make sense, not just logically but also emotionally. And they do succeed. Granted, it's not perfect, and Prometheus especially had some pretty weird and jarring things in it, but this film largely makes up for that. After seeing it, I can see the path from Prometheus to Alien. And it makes sense, is properly horrific as is fitting for this horror franchise, and genuinely works as an overall story.That being said, it stumbles around as a movie. The first third is actually really good. The new characters are interesting, the new planet looks amazing, the horror is there, the anticipation, the tension and when the violence finally comes, it's genuinely thrilling and gory. The second third starts to go downhill. I have nothing against Michael Fassbender in these films, but as we focus on him so much, it almost seems like the xenomorphs become superfluous. And in a way they do, and that's a problem. It simply doesn't feel right when a xenomorph is a B-plot in an Alien film.The final third is much the same as the second, but the final ending is something that I have to admire. Because it's not a typical Hollywood ending. Not even a typical Alien ending in a way. And kudos for that, Ridley Scott.Alien: Covenant doesn't come close to matching the brilliance of Alien and Aliens. But it just might be the third best film in the franchise anyway. It has the vision as well as the ambition, plus beautiful visuals, good action and the best horror moments since those two. A mixed package, but ultimately worth a watch.",Null,2,5,27 June 2017
The Wizard of Oz," Imaginative, sweet and child-like
","I trust that you all know at least the basics of the story. Young Dorothy (Judy Garland) gets pulled into a tornado, which whisks her away into the magical land of Oz, where she has to follow the yellow brick road to meet the wonderful wizard of Oz. Along the way she meets strange fellows and learns all sorts of things.And well... it's really good. What else can you expect from an ageless classic such as this? I was especially impressed by how good the film looked. Especially given that it was shot before World War Two. Yes, sure, all the sets are obviously props, but they're such detailed, colourful and imaginative props. You can see the effort in them. And they contrast with the banality of Dorothy's home farm so nicely.Come to think of it, Oz has a lot of similarities with Alice's Wonderland. They're both about their own logic, or the lack of it, to be more precise. Wonderland more so, but you can see shades of it in Oz as well.Though, to talk about strange stuff, I do believe that the film can cause unintentional shivers down your spine. Kids will probably find the munchkin song about a dead witch charming and likable. As an adult I found the song more than a bit creepy. The dwarf and child actors with their heavy makeups and overly squeaky voices did not help.Still, as soon as the yellow brick road portion of the movie starts, it picks up in quality. All three of Dorothy's travelling companions were utterly likable, but the best among them was easily Ray Bolger as Scarecrow. The way he moved alone was a sight to behold. You could easily believe that this creature had nothing but straw within his clothes, and not a single bone either.The music and the songs were also catchy - even the dead witch one - I liked how dreamlike the story was and overall this is a very nicely made and executed children's film. It's a pity it took me this long to view it. I'm sure I would have loved it as a child.",Null,2,2,10 March 2019
The Martian," Apollo 13 meets Robinson Crusoe
","Set in the not so distant future, The Martian tells about one of the first manned missions to Mars and how one of the astronauts gets left behind when an enormous sandstorm forces the crew to abort the mission. The story is about him trying to survive with extremely limited resources until help can arrive. For it takes about four years to get from Earth to Mars - they have to build the spaceship from scratch and all that - yet he only has food for a few months.Matt Damon plays the lead role here and even though he has been in many good movies previously, I'd still claim that this is one of his finest yet. His range and his skill for acting out complex emotions without verbalizing them is what keeps us grounded, what keeps us with him throughout his ordeal. A nuanced, brilliant performance, deserving of the highest praise. Yet the film also has a very good supporting cast and I like that they focus on the happenings on Earth as well. NASA has rarely looked better on film than it does here.I was also pleasantly surprised how captivating the movie was, given its style and story. Much of the film is really nothing more than constant, endless problem solving, with Damon's character Mark Watney having to overcome problem after another, likewise with NASA. It's a great movie about science and for science. Studying engineering or getting a Ph.D. in something else has never looked more inviting. Yet the movie is never boring, like some of you might think based on what I just said. The emotions are always there, the atmosphere is without a flaw brilliant and the characters feel so real that they will pull you in without a doubt.If I had to name one problem with the film itself it's that you can definitely see that they had to cram a long, long novel full of detail into a single film. Because it really is nothing more than problem after another. So much so that it starts to feel a bit unrealistic. Sure, Mars is a hostile environment, but come on. Even Murphy of the famous Murphy's Law would say that this is a tad extreme.Nevertheless, it's a very good movie. It has a clear identity, excellent story, fantastic cast, good music and is at its core exactly what cinema is all about.",Null,3,6,12 November 2015
"O Brother, Where Art Thou?"," Dapper Dan Dares You to Disapprove!
","Yes sirree, I did see this here picture show, featuring the gentlemen three George Clooney, John Turturro and Tim Blake Nelson. A fine picture. More than fine. Directed by the esteemed Coen Brother. Ethan and Joel. Such fine boys. Very respectable in their fields and purveyors of quality entertainment, of which I've partaken more than once. If I dare reveal such tantalizing little nugget of personal information to your kind self.And I do belief that you don't need to hear any more. But nevertheless, because I'm a throughout man, who believes in not leaving a job unfinished if I can at all help it, I shall go into more detail. Yes sir, I did say more detail and I meant it, so help me God.Misters Clooney, Turturro and Nelson play here three gentleman of ill repute. Veritable scoundrels they are and fresh off the hook of the great state of Mississippi. So to speak. For you see, and I know you'll find this hard to believe, but this here picture show features escaped convicts as its main characters. Now, I know that there are those among your humble and pious ranks whose first reaction is to find this offensive. And to you I say, bless you, kind madams and sirs. Bless you. You are the salt of the Earth and yours is the kingdom of Heaven. And yet to you I also say, open your hearts. For these are the most likable dirty chainbreakers you're ever likely to witness on this good Earth.I might go on to praise the acting of these gentlemen three. Especially that of Mister Clooney, slipping into the guise of Ulysses Everett McGill, a man of words if there ever was one. Why, this man could charm the feathers of a singing bird. He could talk to rain and make it dry. He would don you his hat, flash a smile and become your most trusted friend before dinner.Alas, if we are to talk about this picture show, and talk about it we must, it behooves us to also talk about the mistakes that have slipped in. For you see, and I must ask those weak of heart in the audience to praise themselves, this here picture ain't perfect. I'd dare even say it's flawed.Now, I hear you crying. Mister, what could possibly be wrong with this picture. It's directed by the Brothers Coen. It has Mister George Clooney in it. Its story is based on Homer's The Odyssey. It even has the honour of being the first feature film ever to be fully digitally colour corrected. What possible fault can be found in it?And to you, good sir, I say that the fault lies in its attempt to be a Grecian epic. It's precisely its attempt to imitate art greater than itself which reveals its flaws. Certainly, there are scenes within it that are lifted from the pages of Homer. But they're pale imitations and unwieldy in the setting of Deep South during the decade of 1930. I dare say, they don't fit. They're out of place. They're misaligned, out of whack, purposeless. They are an ill fit.Nevertheless and despite my misgivings about certain aspects of storytelling as they pertain to the general cohesiveness of the cinematic grandiose this picture represents, I did enjoy watching this film. It was a lark, a gay old time. Why, I even find myself recommending it to my friends. Can you imagine?",Null,0,0,27 March 2020
Furious 7," High stakes, fast cars, exotic spy hijinks
","The seventh installment in the Fast & Furious franchise sees the return of Dom (Vin Diesel) and Brian (Paul Walker) as two mercenaries specializing in fast cars. This time the film begins with them resting on their laurels, but their past exploits are about to catch up with them.Furious 7 is probably the most interconnected of the Fast & Furious films. It really requires you to have seen the previous films, or at least it heavily rewards you having done that. Everything from the individual character arcs to the villain himself are building upon the events of the past films and I bet the film would be rather difficult to follow if you haven't seen them. But that's definitely a point in the film's favour, not a weakness.The film's strengths are those of the franchise. It has style in abundance, most of all. It has fast cars, cool soundtrack, suave characters, great actors, hot chicas, high octane action scenes, spy stuff and the kitchen sink as well. And the addition of Jason Statham to the ensemble cast only strengthened the formula.Regrettably, Paul Walker, one of the two main leads of the franchise, passed away in a car accident during the filming of the film. The film was completed using his two brothers as stand-ins, and if you didn't know that, you absolutely wouldn't notice. The film's script was also reworked a little bit in order to retire Brian as a character, and it's a fitting, touching send-off to a great character. Full marks.I still maintain that Fast Five is my favourite movie in the franchise so far, and after that I'd probably go with the first one, but this one would be a close third.",Null,0,0,21 June 2020
The Godfather," One of the finest there is
","The Godfather took the world by a storm upon its release and set the golden standard for crime films to follow, especially those of the gangster subgenre. It also continues to define the careers of many of its actors, including Marlon Brando and Al Pacino. And no wonder, the film is truly wonderful in idea, style and execution. It's also interesting to learn that prior to this film, people didn't really know that much about mafia. Apparently the real mafia even contacted the film makers and politely asked for the actual word mafia not to appear in the film. And it doesn't. Furthermore it's only mentioned once in the sequel.The Godfather is an extremely well-made film as can be expected from Francis Ford Coppola, but what I think elevated this film into such a cultural keystone is its style. It makes organized crime look glorious, operated by people of honour and respect. Yet it doesn't really shy away from the murkier aspects of the organization. Starting from Brando's Vito Corleone, the don of the family. He's an aged man, ravaged by years, and more than capable of making poor decisions. Yet he has this unbelievable presence. The same can be said about his children, all capable and controlling unbelievable resources, but each plagued by limitations, vice and corruption. Michael (Pacino) seemingly being the best out of them, but even he has his flaws, though we would have to wait until the sequel to explore them more in depth.The story reflects the same themes as the characters. It introduces an empire and then proceeds to tear it down, showing how fragile it was in the first place. If the fall of one man can take down everything he has ever built, how well had he built that something in the first place. Special mention should also go to Nino Rota's iconic score. The Godfather theme is one of the most well-known pieces of cinema music in the world, and for a reason. It's subtle, fits the style of the movie perfectly and is instantly recognizable. The music overall is fantastic, but it's that score you'll remember.The Godfather is often called the greatest movie of all time. I can see why, even though it's not my personal favourite. But it's still a masterpiece, no matter how you look at it.",Null,0,0,4 July 2017
