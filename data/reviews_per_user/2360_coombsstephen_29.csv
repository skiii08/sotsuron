Ford v Ferrari," The greatest motor racing film of all time?
","This is a great film in its own right and even as fiction would be superb but as a true story it is truly compelling watching. When I saw the length of the film I thought I bet there is 20 minutes they could have cut out but I was wrong, the film goes by like it's 10 minutes long with not a minute wasted.Damon and Bale are brilliant in their roles, both should be up for oscars, Bale in particular really makes the character and is almost unrecognisable. The CGI is great while not getting in the way of the film and even the sound is fantastic.Is it the greatest motor racing film of all time? It has to be in with a shout and I can't wait to see it again.",9,3,6,18 November 2019
Gremlins," Not as cute and cuddly as I remembered but still a classic
","Just saw the remastered 35th anniversary showing and was a little surprised as the film has a lot more graphic violence than I remember.The film is still great though and has stood the test of time really wel, although it's still a very 80s film. The funny bits are still hilarious and even the more gruesome boys are funny.Still well worth a watch just remember if you have young kids is not all about cute and cuddly gremlins.",8,2,3,6 December 2019
Ghost," So cheesy and aging a bit but still a good film
","I saw the 30th anniversary showing of ghost and although the CGI now looks very dated, as a whole the film stands up as a very unique and will thought out film.It is very cheesy, with loads of glaring holes in the plot and premise, but that doesn't detract from the enjoyment.There is some good acting in the film andalthough of its time, deserves to be called a classic.",7,0,0,15 February 2020
Rocketman," Taron Egerton, Jamie Bell and great songs carry a quite sad biopic
","I always thought of Elton John as someone who had his bad days and tantrums but also didn't take himself too seriously and knew how to laugh at himself a bit but sadly this didn't come across at all in this film. It shows someone who was constantly brilliant but constantly unloved, lonely and sad throughout his whole early life. There are no happy times at all despite his great success, and we are reminded of both the sadness and success over and over again.It is also sad that, despite a great vocal performance by Taron Egerton, there are no versions of these brilliant songs that I think people will want to hear again from the soundtrack, just because of the way they are used.What saves the film, apart from the reminder of the phenomenal back catalogue Elton John has, is the acting performance of Egerton, Jamie Bell and The more minor role of Stephen Graham. All are excellent.",6,7,22,21 May 2019
Captain Marvel," Decent plot and an OK film not helped by some wooden acting
","I always say first I am not a comic book geek, I just judge all films on their merit. To be honest this one feels like just a filler and back story before the next Avengers film.I didn't mind the plot, it's Ok if a little thin but has a decent twist. What bothered me most was what I felt was some quite soulless and laboured acting by Jude Law and Brie Larson, which was a surprise.The acting of Samuel L Jackson is a real plus point as is the music. I also enjoyed The action sequences and the CGI is excellent.",7,2,5,15 March 2019
Us," An OK film but just a bit letdown with a poorly carried out plot
","I found the film ok, it was well paced and there were a few decent scenes in it. It is also a novel idea for a film.However I thought a good story idea was let down by a plot that was ill conceived and quite ridiculous at times. It fell into the trap of characters doing ridiculous things that are far from believable even in a film. I won't spoiler the film but some of the characters go from the sublime to the ridiculous in moments.Also I didn't really get the ending and explanation of the idea behind the story, either it wasn't well explained or it just went over my head.",5,1,3,27 March 2019
Knives Out," A good murder mystery with a few good laughs thrown in
","Makes me wonder why we don't get many murder mysteries anymore, hopefully after this we will.An all star cast with some very good acting make this a film will work watching for a good plot with plenty of twists but also sprinkled with comedy right through out.I don't want to give anything away but I felt it came up just s little short of a classic but I really enjoyed it and would recommend it to anyone.",7,5,16,25 November 2019
Aquaman," A decent movie taking a different angle on the normal superhero caper.
",I must admit I am not a comic book fan so I knew nothing of Aquaman before seeing this. As a standalone film it works. The story of the sea gods is quite different for me and I thought is was done well.The lead character was a bit of a relief from the normal super hero and I thought he was played well. Some of the side characters got a bit irritating and the film took a predictable path towards the end but it was still well worth the watch.,7,0,0,6 February 2019
Alien," 40th Anniversary screening - Still a great thriller on the big screen.
","Amazingly, as a 50 year old man, I had never seen this classic. I was a bit young when it came out then never fancied it. So when the chance came up to see this screening I summoned up the courage to see it.Much like Jaws the thriller element, including the brilliant background music and sound, builds up the suspense, in what is quite a simple story and plot with some amazing twists.The effects are now a bit dated but as it scI-fi this isn't a surprise but this doesn't detract from a great movie.",9,1,2,5 March 2019
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Not a bad film but the same old formula
","All good things have to come to an end but I can't help feeling this series has more that run its course.This is a pretty good movie with some good humour and nice tie backs to the past, and possibly if they weren't being judged against the original trilogy they would be seen as a pretty good trilogy in their own right.However in the end the story and plot of this movie is, in general, quite predictable and it feels like a handle had been cranked and another star wars script had popped out, using the same well trodden path, trying and failing to recreate the magic of the originals.Go see it but don't expect anything more than just another new star wars movie. It's time to move on.",7,10,29,19 December 2019
Notting Hill," Has the ultimate RomCom stood the the rest of time? Without doubt
","Just been to a 20th anniversary valentines screening of Notting Hill. I was worried that such a classic film might actually be a bit of a let down after so long.I need not have worried,it was superb and perhaps even better knowing what was coming and just enjoying the film.Watching again on the big screen it really comes across just how brilliant Julia Roberts is in this. She basically is playing herself, I guess, but even so her performance is flawless. Compare her to Andi McDowell in 4 weddings and it shows why Roberts is still A list.Hugh Grant is great as Hugh Grant as he usually is and the supporting cast really make the comedy and add realism to the film. On top of this the soundtrack still stands up.Still the ultimate RomCom, a classic.",9,7,7,14 February 2019
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse," More one for the comic book enthusiasts
",Despite never having read a comic book and knowing very little about the different universes and characters I have really enjoyed most the recent film adaptations. However I found this film was far closer to a comic book than the others and didn't make for such a good standalone film for non enthusiasts.However I must say the animation is good and the music enjoyable.,6,6,15,25 January 2019
Yesterday," Loved it as a Beatles fan, Richard Curtis and Danny Boyle combine for a British classic
","In my opinion there are so many fantastic songs from arguably the greatest band of all time, that I thought a comedy film would surely be a let down but no, Curtis and Boyle have made a great film with good humour and emotional highs and lows.The pace of the film is good and there are some good surprises. The premise of the film is unique and makes for some good running and in jokes. There is also a lot of empathy for the characters, which shows how good it is.My only reason for it not getting a star more was the plot is a little obvious and a bit of a slow start but it's still a film worth seeing more than once.",8,29,59,28 June 2019
Avengers: Endgame," An amazing film even for non comic book fans
","With among the biggest anticipation for a film ever this film needed to deliver and it did just that.A comparatively slow start was great build up to a huge ending and an excellent ending to the saga.Massive shocks and big plot twists make this a film that's essential to see twice to take everything in I think. The acting and animation is about as good as it gets for now. Some great humour as well.I will be shocked if another film in 2019 tops this in the film charts and maybe, as sagas go, star wars is now knocked off its perch at the top.",9,1,3,28 April 2019
Toy Story 4," A different more mature film but it doesn't let the franchise down, it's epic
","It was a real fear for me that after one of the greatest movie trilogies that Disney had decided to cash in and put a film that would ruin it but my fears were allayed, this film is as good as the rest.I did find this a bit of a different from the rest, it has grown a bit with its audience, although it wouldn't be a let down for little ones it still works on that level. My teenage sons loved it just as much as me so the film is pitched brilliantly on lots of levels. There are also tearful moments as well.There are plenty of new characters to mix things up but the old favourites remain. The film is perfectly paced and flies by with plenty going on and a few well worked twists.A real family film for all ages and one I can't wait to see again.",9,36,68,23 June 2019
The Favourite," A reasonable film with a few laughs but an award winning classic? No
","This is a historical film with almost little substance to actual history of the time. It is quite funny in a few parts and the period costumes and settings are quite good.However it is not a classic. The story is OK but is really something of nothing. The shock factor it tries to deliver doesn't work nowadays and the ending is just non existent. As the credits came up there was almost an audible 'eh?' from the audience as the film came to virtually no conclusion.Maybe I am not cultured or arty enough to get why this film is seen as so brilliant, I don't know, but I really don't get the fuss.Olivia Coleman is quite good but I don't see how critics are saying its an award winning performance. In fact I thought Emma Stones performance was far more worth of mention.",6,1,2,6 February 2019
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," More mature Tarantino with less violence but still a great movie
","It's hard not to have very high expectations of a Tarantino movie but this film didn't disappoint.The acting of all the leads is superb and some of the scenes in the film are pure brilliance.It is not his best film but to be honest that is such a high bar to hit, it says more about Tarantino than it does about this film. It's still great.",8,7,18,15 August 2019
Aladdin," A good film made great by Will Smith even for adults
","Whenever I see a remake of a classic film I prepare for disappointment but this film was a pleasant surprise.It's a good film until Will Smith arrives as the genie then the film really takes off. He brings some good laughs and the pace really steps up.Aside from Will Smith the acting is ok and the CGI and scenery is excellent.It's a shame the music still leans on the original for the best song, with maybe only one of the new ones anywhere close to being one that may catch on but that isn't the end of the world.This is a great family film well worth a watch.",8,17,58,23 May 2019
The Lion King," Incredible CGI save a pretty lame carbon copy remake
","The first thing to say about this film is it really does set a new high bar in cinematic CGI. It is truly incredible, I really couldn't work at all if the whole thing was real with CGI added or just wholly CGI and it is worth seeing on that basis alone.It is just a shame that the story didn't get anything like the same makeover. If you have seen the first you have seen the second. I know it's a remake but from memory it's almost a complete copy just with live action. Same scenes, songs and characters, nothing seems to have changed.There are some very funny scenes and the characters and songs are still great but you do end up thinking was it just done for the sake of it?",7,0,2,21 July 2019
1917," A different and brilliant way of filming makes for a fantastically intense movie
",Most war films are intense but this goes to a whole new level in its own way. The film being set in one long shot is very unique but works brilliantly.The pace of the movie is incredible it goes past in the blink of an eye and at the end the first thing I thought was 'I have to see that again'.Because of the pace of the film it doesn't allow for a lot of character development outside of the main characters but that doesn't detract at all.A great film and a brilliant bit of directing.,8,7,10,16 January 2020
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," The difficult middle film is still ok
",It's always hard to pitch the middle film in s trilogy especially one as high profile at this but this film does ok even a few years on.The characters develop and the story is still good although it does jump the shark at times on the survival aspect.It's sets up the last film but maybe lacks a bit of climax on reflection but maybe only after the last film will we really know.,7,0,8,18 December 2019
Groundhog Day," Watched twice as a double bill on groundhog anniversary, still brilliant
","I went to see this twice on one night as a double bill, and it was still well worth watching the second time.A brilliant comedy with a very unique plot and I think is probably Bill Murray's high point as an actor. His stages of dealing with his situation are both interesting and hilarious at the same time.A great film that has aged really well.",9,2,3,9 July 2019
Joker," Phoenix is incredible in this old school dark twist on the superhero genre
","After years of superhero films with massive budgets and incredible CGI, of which there is nothing wrong, it was great to see a film that was just that, a great film with a great story that was brilliantly acted, without the need for massive special effects.I really can see this being the film that launches 1000 copy cats and creates is own genre, blurring the line of good and evil.I was slightly concerned that now the moral overtone could become that the bad are bad because the rich made them that way and so become the victims but maybe that's just another new perspective.Whatever is a brilliant film and phoenix deserves an Oscar for it. The best lead I have seen this year without doubt.",8,0,3,15 October 2019
Parasite," A brilliantly unique movie with endless unseen twists and turns
",Its not often I go to see subtitled films but given the reviews I thought and I had to see this one and I am so glad I did.It's fantastically different and a great story that really draws you in but never stops surprising you with a laugh or shock around every corner.A great film and well worth anyone's time to go and see it.,8,14,21,24 January 2020
Jojo Rabbit," Great concept and a funny film
","It's excellent to see a film that is really unique in concept and delivery, especially when it contains great dark humour, which seems rare today.The film has a good story and some of the acting is excellent in it. There are plenty of twists and turns and there is constant humour with some great characters.I felt at times it was a little slow and some of the humour a little obvious and at times childish but still a film very much worth seeing.",7,0,1,9 January 2020
Midway," Very good war film sadly let down by some ridiculous over acting
","In the most part I really enjoyed this film. The graphics are amazing and it really Kris good pace with a good view on the events from both sides, with a little bit of Hollywood license thrown in, which I don't mind too much.What let's it down a little is some of the acting. Maybe it is done to appeal more to the American audiences but some of the 'All American Hero' over acting is cringe worthy and laughable at times.But don't let that put you off, this is a good film done in the old style and is well worth a watch.",7,1,2,14 November 2019
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Has stood the test of time well
",I saw this again as part of s triple bill on opening night of episode 9 and I was pleasantly surprised how well this film has held up.Although maybe not the best star wars film out has a very good recipe of characters and story line to set up the beginning of the end of the series.Although there are still some characters I don't think are great and some questionable acting is still a great film.,7,2,10,18 December 2019
The Matrix," 20th Anniversary screening - has lost nothing in that time
","When this film was released it was so ground breaking I was worried that mind challenging concept would be faded in time but this wasn't the case, the film is still as explosive and interesting as it was when it first cam out.I guess the older CGI does Show a little in these modern times of seamless CGI but in no way does it letdown the film and action scenes are still as brilliant as ever.The film is quite long but goes past really quickly as the action is non stop.It is still well worth 2 hours of anyone's time, for first timers and people who have enjoyed it before, alike.",9,1,1,30 July 2019
Green Book," Simple story, simple film and simply brilliant....
","Its hard to say why but this is just a great film. The story line could not be simpler, based on a true story, its about a white man drives a black man across the American south in the early 60's. There isn't a lot more to it apart from that, and yet it is captivating. Its about 2 hours long but it felt like 10 minutes.Thankfully the film does not try to ram home any particular message, it shows all sides of a very different time and it works wonderfully.The acting and character development is just about perfect, they have you totally bought into them very quickly and nothing feels like its exaggerated at any point. There are some really good laughs, some tears and a lots of admiration.This film deserves all the awards it gets.",9,2,3,6 February 2019
