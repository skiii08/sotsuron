Gremlins," Awesome
","Some people just didn't get it. This movie is not only the greatest comedy I have ever seen but also the best horror film I have ever seen. It is just so funny and disgusting at the same time that you will just love it. First the there is Gizmo the cutest thing you have ever seen in any movie. It makes a great pet. But you have to remember these three rules, Don't expose him to bright lights and especially not sun light it will kill him, never get him wet, and the most important rule the rule you must never forget, no matter how much he cries and how much he begs never ever feed him after midnight. With these three rules the young Peltzer acepts his new pet and frient. But he gets a hell of a lot more than he bargainded for. Because if you them after midnight they turn into little mean grean monsters with razor sharp teeth.",10,0,1,3 June 2000
Gladiator," Not bad
",This could have been a real master piece and the best movie of the year if a couple of details. The gore is totally exarragated in many parts in which they were not necessary. You expect violence in a movie like this but it was just way too much. Also  all the other Gladiators would not have been that nice to Maximus in real life. They would normally just save themselfs. So the movie is not bad but not as good as it could be.,8,0,0,6 June 2000
