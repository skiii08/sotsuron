Sucker Punch," piece of ca ca, crap, poop, feces, turd, dump, brown remains.
","i just watched the first hour of sucker punch before i became suicidal after realizing such garbage was made and not one human being second guessed this horse CRAP before it was produced. if you LOVE very heavy makeup, E grade acting, mediocre looking actresses, slow motion, and horrible animated fight scenes to nu metal, then please watch this film and then kill yourself. lets just say that i am personally offended knowing that this film exists. THIS IS MY WORLD TOO LENNOX HOUSE. honestly i could have delivered lines in a more believable manner while drunk and high. sweet pea- 'earth, wind, fire, water.......THIS PLAN IS CRAZY!' the soundtrack in this film gave me second hand embarrassment. i CANNOT WAIT for the still frames of this film to be completely made fun of with word captions. can somebody please do a voice over to this entire film? i guess i am inspired to re-write this script and be sure to use ub-40's 'red wine' EVERY SINGLE TIME there is a slow motion sequence happening, so pretty much 95% of the film will be just ub40. in closing, Vanessa H was high. i have NEVER seen somebody's blood shot eyes make it to the big screen. finally, my credibility: okay, i just got back from contemplating what to write to convince you that i have some credibility on here...i got nothing. just know, i am going to do anything and everything in my power to protect the people i love from this PUNISHMENT of a film.",1,43,93,28 March 2011
