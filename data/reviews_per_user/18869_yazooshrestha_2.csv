Ford v Ferrari," Perfecto!!
",This movie was so good that everything in it was perfect. Hats off to all cast and crews. All the action sequence were amazing and the plot was also moving with character development. James Mangold once again proves himself as a superfine director.,10,8,25,12 November 2019
Joker," Joaquin!! This year's oscar is all yoursðŸ’ª
",This movie is truely a masterpiece. Rather than a comic book flick this movie wasa total psychological study. Joaquin Phoenix was really awesome as Joker. He really made us feel compassion and sorrow for the suffering he has been facing from the dirty political society.,2,1,5,4 October 2019
