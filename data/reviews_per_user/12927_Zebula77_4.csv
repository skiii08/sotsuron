Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Great film, unjustly critizised.
","It's now been three years since I first saw this film, and I've seen it 7 or 8 times since then. The thing that strikes me is that this is a really good action adventure. It is not as good as the original trilogy or Episode II: Attack Of The Clones, and yes it's flawed. It's flat in places, and Jar Jar has too much screen time. Apart from those minor gripes it is a fantastically entertaining and exciting piece of movie making with some of the best action set-pieces ever filmed, like the Pod race and the end Lightsaber duel.The music, as always very good. As are the sound effects (I still can't believe they didn't win the Oscar in that category). So in hindsight, avoiding all the hype, I can say that I still enjoy this film immensely and will probably see it many times in the years to come. Rating:9/10",6,1,2,28 May 2002
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," One word: Fantastic!!!!
","Alright then, what can I say about this film?I will not talk about the plot, since most of you will know the plot by now. I am going to talk about how this film made me feel while seeing it. After all, that's what's important.First of all, the acting was very good. The lines are sometimes a bit stiff, but Hayden, Natalie and Ewan in particular shine. At times, their plight really made me grab the seat and hold my breath in excitement.The story, although talky in parts, is always engaging and interesting. And most important of all, very emotional. Especially during the last hour, which is some of the best cinema I've ever witnessed - funny, sad, suspenseful, desperate, romantic, scary and truly captivating.The music is way better than in Phantom Menace. The new love theme deserves special mention, since it is so rousing and beautiful, it can drive a grown man to tears.(trust me, I know this from personal experience!)All in all, a fantastic film that brings balance to the Force. I cannot wait for Episode III.Rating: 10/10",7,0,0,21 May 2002
The Patriot," Over-patriotic nonsense.
","This film was utter cack. There were so many scenes were I felt nauseated at the over-american spirit of Mel's character and the incredibly two dimensional way the British were represented. They were all evil, child killers who burn churches with people in it. The rest of the characters weren't exactly well developed either.Ok, so there are some good action scenes, and some nice gore on display, but sitting through the entire film for a few thrills is not something I'm willing to do.All in all, this a 'Braveheart' wannabe that falls short in every way. 3/10",6,3,6,20 August 2002
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," The Best Film I Have Ever Seen!
","What can I say about a film I've seen more than 30 times? This is my favourite of all Star Wars films and as I'm a huge SW fan, it is also my favourite film of all time. It has my favourite soundtrack of any film. I especially like 'The Empirial March' and the Han and Leia Love them which ends the film so beautifully, it brings tears to my eyes.There are so many fantastic scenes in this film - the Battle of Hoth, the chase through the asteroids, the introduction of Yoda and Boba Fett, the training of Luke and especially the emotional lightsaber dual between Luke and Vader and of course, the big revelation at the end.I have long since memorized most of the lines and, much to the chagrin of my friends, speak them out loud whenever we see the film. I also hum and whistle along to the music.Everything about this film is wonderful - the dialogue, the performances (especially Mark Hamill's. The best of his career), the action set-pieces, the bad guys (Boba is just sooo cool), the special effects (which look better than CGI in my opinion), the characterisation and most of all, the plot.All in all, a 'must-see-again-and-again' film if ever there was one.Rating 10/10(the 10 rating above all others, if there is such a thing)",10,0,0,29 May 2002
