Casablanca," Instant Favorite
","I only heard of this movie before watching it, and I heard mixed reviews. The movie deserves to be played over and over again. You just don't see such quality in movies anymore. Movies like Casablance pertain to what was going on in the world at the time. It is one thing to just entertain, but quality entertainment is the best. Casablanca had a great cast and Bogurt absolutely made the movie. He gave Americans a tough guy look back in the 40's when this was released. He had a good sense for what was authentic and what was phooey. He also did a good job portraying what heartbreak is like for men. The way he tricked everyone but in the end saved the say for everyone and made some characters realize what they should represent. Overall, a great movie that deserves all the hype associated with it.",9,1,2,13 March 2013
Citizen Kane," Enjoyed It Thoroughly
","I saw this movie a couple times and each time it was just as interesting if not more interesting time the next time. It is about a tragic story of a man that had everything, but really had nothing. The acting is pretty good, but after a while the main character, Kane, becomes annoying to listen to (i think that was the point). For a black and white film this movie has a lot of character. The camera work really made the film i think. The use of lighting and shining light on specific spots really added to the mystique. This movie really deserves to be considered one of the best of all time, it touches on a lot of social issues and what really should matter in life.",9,1,2,10 May 2013
Singin' in the Rain," Yes
","I enjoyed every aspect of this movie. From the plot to the acting to the cinematography. Everything was made perfectly, and the songs weren't 'corny' but instead catchy! The characters all evolve a little, and the annoying protagonist gets hers in the end. This movie is perfect for any age. This movie is a musical, if you didn't gather that. Most people my age wouldn't agree, but musicals can be interesting, and this movie is great evidence. Also, a lot of editing and mechanics went into this movie. A lot of special effects were added, but it made it that much more fun to watch. Not many dull moments in this film!",10,1,4,10 May 2013
