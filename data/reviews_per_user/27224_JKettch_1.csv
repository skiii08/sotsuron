Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Not sure
","Well, folks. I'm still not sure what I should think about 'Episode I - The Phantom Menace'. ok, it is a good SF-Movies, but as a Star-Wars-Part? No. Not good. I'm missing the interesting features and scenes of the 'old' three parts.  For sure many ideas in these three old movies were kind of stolen.....but Lucas built with own ideas a fanastic and amazing story. Now, in Episode I, he even stole ideas, scenes, from his first movies, but he did it very very bad. The conversations of the actors seem to be to formal, stiff. Some roles are just disturbing...yep, Jar Jar Binks....he is just anoying. And as a Star-Wars-Fan the most worst part is how George Lucas is handling the 'force'. Jedis are measuring the force by controlling the blood!?!?!?!?!? Oh Lord, thats against everything I saw in the old movies (relating to the force), read in Star Wars-Books or Comics.Ok, like I told above.....forget Epsiode I as a Star-Wars-Movie, just see it as an interesting SF-Movie with nice Special-Effects.",7,0,0,4 May 2001
