50 First Dates," Best romantic comedy ever! (I mean it)
","What can I say? This is the best romantic comedy that I've ever seen. A sweet story, and great casting with fantastic attention to the small details that truly make a movie.Doesn't matter if you're in a relationship or not, you'll love it.I know it sounds crazy, because Adam Sandler is never in anything good - this movie is the one fantastic exception.By the way, 'Hukilau' (as in 'Hukilau Cafe') actually has a meaning - depending on context, it is either a method of mass net-fishing from the shore practiced by Hawaiians for centuries, or a celebratory gathering on the beach.",Null,1,1,14 April 2012
Knowing," Clever and well done.
","This movie was a nice surprise. I usually don't like Nicholas Cage movies. Any of them. But he was perfectly cast for this science fiction piece and delivered a solid, believable performance.The story itself was brand new, not a rehash of any tale that I can recall.The directing allowed you to see the film without knowing until the very end what was happening - which was great. I usually enjoy figuring out the end before it gets there, because it usually seems that if I CAN'T figure it out... the movie is poor. That has been my experience. But Knowing delivered a solid mystery up to the end, with the type of finale where one thinks, 'Oh, I should have seen it coming, those 100 things that happened all make sense!' Really, all the little details came together in a flash of a solid closing.I also appreciated that there were no loose ends. Everything was tied together in a neat bow with nothing hanging out.The only negative that I have will sound humorous to you if you don't see the movie, but I won't spoil it for you except to say that the metaphor of a pair of bunnies wasn't necessary.Catch this movie when you can, it's definitely worth it.",Null,12,20,3 January 2012
Unknown," Excellent action thriller from start to finish.
","This is a short and sweet review. Unknown is a great movie.I did basically 'solve' the mystery of the movie halfway through, but keeping with it to see if I was right was part of the fun. Great performances and though I never say this - great locations. I don't know why, they just fit the story perfectly.It was a movie with a taste of Bourne Identity to it, but better.In the end, it left me with only one question, one that I can only wave off as, 'Well, there wouldn't have been a movie if that hadn't happened.'Rent, buy or otherwise see this movie, you'll love it.",Null,1,2,29 December 2011
Taken," Best action movie I have ever seen!
","I know, a claim of a perfect 10 movie probably sounds implausible. But Taken really is the best action movie that I've seen in my life, from about 1980 on, when I was old enough to notice things like that.I could go on, but it's simple enough to say that the story, directing, casting and performances all come together to make a work of cinematic art that you can't ignore. Liam Neeson and Maggie Grace make for what sound like an unlikely pairing, but in the end jive into a perfect father-daughter set.The story is great. At first one might roll there eyes at 'another dad goes for his daughter rescue movie.' Taken is anything but that. It's not a simple, 'Oh gee, person (X) is holding my daughter hostage.' No, it's a complex tale of despair and danger in what is unfortunately a real-life threat. The hostage isn't sitting in a room, she's on the move between sets of devious people supported by money, graft and corruption. It's brilliant. It's HONEST.Since this is the spoiler version, I like that the writer made the characters (primarily Neeson, as the main character) react realistically to the situation. He's an ex-CIA agent, trained to kill and with decades of experience. When it comes to fighting with someone, or tracking someone, or getting information... he doesn't do anything cute, he just does it. There are no long kung fu fight scenes, or breaking elbows backwards. No knife throwing and fighting. He just kills them, boom, hand to hand, or puts a bullet in their chest. Maybe this sounds silly, but it's nice to see a super agent actually BE a super agent.The final scene? The true ultimate spoiler? Ever seen a Mexican standoff where the good guy ends up dropping his weapon and then the scene develops into some stupid game of cat-and-mouse to win? Well, a Mexican standoff does happen. Or rather, the bad guy tries it. Puts a knife to Neeson's daughter's neck and hides behind her. Neeson hesitates in the standoff, his pistol raised... and then a few seconds later, after he's had time to perfectly line up his shot, puts a bullet in the guy's head, firing past his daughter. Just what you want to see from a super spy marksman.Honestly, when that happened I cheered and almost jumped off the couch shouting, 'FINALLY!!!' It was good to see the 'reality' of a rescue/espionage film.Go out and see this movie. In fact, don't even rent it. Go out and find it at the store and buy the DVD. You WILL watch it over and over.",Null,0,3,3 January 2012
War of the Worlds," Painful. Just painful.
","The original H.G. Wells story? A literary masterpiece.The Orson Wells radio broadcast? Fantastic.The 1953 Hollywood movie? A lot of fun.This chunk of cinema? 116 minutes of my life that I'll never get back.I can summarize the movie this briefly, and without being a spoiler: * Tom Cruise spends two hours running around, out of breath, yelling at people while the ridiculous side stories about his children muddle the original plot.That's it.For those detail folk reading this, enjoy the incredible foresight of the Martians and their war machines.Just... go and pick another movie to watch. Pick up the 1953 movie and watch it.",Null,1,4,25 December 2011
Signs," Logic is so completely absent it's ridiculous. This is the 'twist:'
","So it turns out the yes, aliens are invading Planet Earth.They land, you essentially never see them or hear about them doing anything except for a shot of one passing in front of bushes at a kid's birthday party.Then they go home, after annoying people for no apparent reason.Oh, and they're just people in dark green green suits.Why did they come? Nobody knows, and really in the end, nobody cares. Because these have to be the dumbest aliens in the galaxy.Why did they leave so abruptly? Because water is poisonous to them. Yeah. They crossed interstellar distances to invade a planet whose surface alone is 70%+ covered in a substance that is toxic to them. So what about the oceans and lakes? Or taking slaves that are mostly water, or food that is based on water...... what's next, the Human Race invades Venus and is shocked to find out that the clouds and raining sulfuric acid aren't conducive to colonization? Because that would be the equivalent.This is a terrible movie with a twist fit only for people who watch movies without asking questions of the obvious. I don't know why people keep buying the guy's scripts.'War of the Worlds' was brilliant for its time. Germs had just been discovered. It made sense for the time period. But aliens who can cross the stars to invade a world toxic to them? Did they never develop the science of simple spectroscopy? Don't see this movie. Take a sharp blow to the head first. Ask someone else about the medical reality of a woman being cut in half but able to survive until her husband has to make the hard choice of pulling the F-150 off of her.",Null,7,13,13 March 2012
