Black Swan," One of the greats
","In the same mould as 'Whiplash', Black Swan is at its core a dark tale, but one that explores both the positive and negative consequences of Artistic passion, perfectionism and the often unhealthy demands at their core. Ultimately, the film's great strength is the effortless way it deals with the relentless fracturing and reforming of the human psyche that becomes more exaggerated at the limits of our endurance.The film is superbly executed, and achieves that rare feat of being both visually captivating and intellectually stimulating. Indeed, Aronofsky manages to deliver a film that deals with some truly emotive themes without ever really presenting them for judgement or encasing them within a traditional Hollywood narrative. Portman delivers an excellent performance, and proves to be the perfect choice for such a physically and technically demanding role.In summary, a compelling watch & Highly recommended",9,1,3,16 November 2015
Whiplash," A really special film
","I created an IMDb account because i was so offended by losing an hour and a half of my life to 'the Purge' that i felt compelled to share my pain with the IMDb world. Thankfully, my second 'review' is simply to share my appreciation for one of the most captivating films i've ever had the privilege to watch. The film captures so many of the tortuous and joyful aspects of obsession & passion and the relationship between two people who challenge one another. More than that however, it's been channelled into a exceptional, and hugely accessible film which i urge you to find the time to watch if you haven't already. If you were thinking of watching 'the Purge', do the ol' switcheroo.",10,1,3,16 October 2015
The Purge," So bad it deserves a franchise
","From the first ill-conceived concept, throughout the totally implausible middle, until the brain fart of an ending, this is one of the worst films i have ever watched.At the end of the film i signed up to IMDb just so i could review this film and express my disdain for such a pathetic waste of time and money. Genuinely, the only thing that this film provoked in me was a sense of incredulity, and i suppose the possibility that American society must be insane to entertain the notion. Worth watching to determine the condition of your mental health.",1,6,12,24 March 2014
