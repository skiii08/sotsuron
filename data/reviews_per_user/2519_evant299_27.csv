Changeling," A Must See!!!
","This is one of Angelina Jolie's best performances! This film has great acting performances from both Angelina Jolie and John Malkovich. I don't understand why this film is so underrated! It has Great acting and great cinematography. the Cinemotagraphy was great! It perfectly captured the time period and the music also fit there scenes in this film well! Yes, some of Clint Eastwood's films may have been a bit better than this but this film is still excellent. In my opinion, i would not listen to the negative reviews. i would recommend this to fans of Angelina Jolie, fans of John Malkovich, and fans of Clint Eastwood's work as a director! This was truly a great film! Bravo!",10,2,2,18 August 2014
Minority Report," An Interesting Sci-Fi Film
","This is a very interesting film. It has a great plot, an A list cast and even though it is 2 hours and 22 minutes this is one of those rare films that manages to keep you entertained and interested the whole way through. This film reminds me of Blade Runner a bit but the man that wrote the short story that blade runner is based off of is written by the same author that wrote the short story that this film is based off of so it is no surprise that they feel like they are in the same universe. I recommend this to sci-fi fans or fans of people that enjoy watching films with great special effects and a good story line. when i put this film on my expectations were low because it didn't seem that interesting to me but i gave it a try and it surprised me because it turned out to be a great film that was very interesting and kept you on the edge of your seat. Bravo!",9,0,0,2 August 2014
The Great Dictator," A poignant Dark comedy
","This was a great dark comedy! This was the first Charlie Chaplin film that i have seen that was not a silent film! It had the same goofiness and deadpan humor that was in some of Chaplin's other films such as city lights except a lot of the humor had a darker tone to it. It wasn't extremely dark like some of todays comedies but it was still a bit dark. Fans of the film Doctor Strangelove should enjoy this film. This film is about a Jewish barber and a dictator (both played by Charlie Chaplin) this film also conveys the themes of hope, peace, and equality. as with all of Charlie Chaplin films this film has a very poignant tone to it. fans of Charlie Chaplin should definitely check this film out. Every gag exhibited in this film was funny and almost none of the gags fell flat. Bravo!",10,2,3,17 August 2014
Battleship Potemkin," Surprisingly Good.
",This silent film was surprisingly good. I was expecting a boring story with many plot holes and with a confusing plot that was complicating and hard to follow. What i got is a dramatic Film that was surprisingly good and ahead of its time. I rated it 9/10 because it was great and clearly ahead of its time but it wasn't perfect. I think that anyone interested in early film making or film studies should watch this because this was definitely a landmark of a film. The plot was very interesting and simplistic so it wasn't easy to lose interest. It is about sailors that rebel against their bosses that are in control of the battleship Potemkin. The rebellion reaches the shores and soon all sailors begin to rebel. It was very interesting and i think film buffs should watch this. it isn't to long of a movie either so it does not get really draggy or anything.,9,0,0,12 August 2014
Lost in Translation," Amazing!
","This film was great! It was very poignant, touching, and in some instances funny! Both Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson give great performances! Sometimes you don't need a complicated plot to make a great movie! this films plot is extremely simple, but that is the beauty of it! It feels realistic, because there is no CGI or special effects. this film feels like it could easily be based on a true story because it is something that could happen! It felt like a documentary! The cinemotagraphy really captured the beautiful scenery in tokyo, Japan. This is a must see for any film buff because this is one of those rare films that really proves you don't need a plot that is full of action and fantasy! you could make a great film out of the simplest script! I highly recommend this film! Anna Faris and Giovanni Ribisi also had small roles in this film! I recommend this to any fans of film!",10,0,0,18 August 2014
Full Metal Jacket," Another Masterpiece from Stanley Kubrick!
","The performance of R. Lee ermey was amazing and mesmerizing. The first hour of the film when the soldiers were in boot camp was unique and powerful. everything about this film is good but i do have one con: I think that the war scenes could have been better. don't get me wrong, the war part was great but i was expecting it to be a unique war film with unique battle scenes. All in all it was a great war film. i really did like the training part when r. lee ermey played gunnery Sgt. Hartman. it was a truly powerful film with lots of symbolism i highly recommend it! yes it has one drawback but it is a small drawback that is overpowered by the good parts of the film! it is definitely worth watching! besides what film doesn't have at least one small flaw! i highly recommend it! Bravo!",9,0,1,3 July 2014
The Grapes of Wrath," A powerful classic!
","This movie is a powerful film. It focuses on a families journey to California in search of work during the great depression era. The movie gives an inside look at the horrible living conditions these people had to deal with. Henry Fonda gives a truly powerful performance as the ex Prisoner Tom Joad who reunites with his family to accompany them on their journey to California. This is a classic movie that won 2 awards in the 1940 Academy awards. Any film buff should watch this. It is definitely one of the best movies of all time without a doubt. Even if the plot doesn't interest you, it is still worth seeing for henry Fondas powerful. performance.",7,0,1,1 July 2014
The Aviator," One of the most underrated films of the 2000's
",I do not understand why everyone hates this movie! This is one of Leonardo Dicaprios best performances. Cate Blanchet is also great as Katherine Hepburn. This film is so well directed and filmed by Martin Scorcese that it makes you feel like you are in the time period that the movie takes place in. This film has a very nostalgic feel to it. I especially liked how Martin Scorcese used music that matched the time period and filmed it using the color techniques that were used in the era this takes place in. It made the movie have a older feel to it like you were really in the time period. This is one of Martin Scorceses most underrated films. I especially loved the scenes that showed Howard Hughes directing movies because that sort of thing really interests me and it is cool to see how they did visual effects back in the 1920's. Any fan of martin Scorcese should watch this and anyone that is interested in Howard Hughes should watch this also. It does seem a little long and draggy in certain parts but it didn't bother me because i found this film so interesting. This is now one of my favorite films because it is beautifully directed and acted and it gives you an insight on early film making and on Howard Hughes and the people he associated with such as Ava Gardner and Katherine Hepburn. Bravo!,10,2,2,11 August 2014
Watchmen," A Great film!
","This movie was excellent! It had great special effects, great acting, and a great plot! Jackie Earle Haley's Rorschach is now one of my favorite super hero characters ( next to heath Ledgers joker and Christian bales batman of course!) I don't understand how this film got so many negative reviews from audiences and film critics alike! This film is the perfect mix of sci-fi,action, drama, and mystery. i would recommend this too fans of the dark knight trilogy. There was never a dull moment in this film! Also it had great cinematography that captured really cool shots of special effects scenes! I think that fans of superhero films should definitely see this one! Bravo!",10,0,1,17 August 2014
Apocalypse Now," Apocalypse Now review
","Apocalypse Now is a suspenseful, dramatic, and tragic war film. It stars Martin sheen, Robert duvall Laurence fishburne and Marlon Brando. it is about how during the Vietnam war a group of soldiers are sent on a mission to assassinate colonel Kurtz (Marlon Brando) Along the way their are many unplanned tragic events. Apocalypse Now is a fast moving war film. there is something about it that sets it apart from other war films. It moves fast even in its slower parts. It went by really fast and you almost don't want it to end. Martin sheen and Marlon Brando give great performances. I highly recommend it to anyone who likes films like this.",10,0,1,1 July 2014
Being John Malkovich," Extremely Overrated!!!
",i would like to start off by saying that this film is extremely overrated! I found some of the characters reactions to things to be extremely unrealistic and absurd. i was constantly aware of the fact that i was watching a film and that can be very distracting! i thought that things were overblown and extremely exaggerated in every way. The reason why i gave it 3/10 instead of 1/10 is because it was a unique idea but it was poorly executed and could have been done better. It is the weirdest film i have ever seen and i have seen a lot of films! i have seen about 600 now! I regret watching it and i expected more from Cameron diaz and john cusack. the acting was also bad but that could be contributed to the poor writing not the actors fault. It just felt over the top for me. It is supposed to be a comedy but it is almost never funny and this film has an extremely weird sense of humor and you are expected to laugh at situations that aren't even funny!,3,7,14,18 August 2014
The Machinist," An excellent psychological Drama with a strong Christian message!
","Christian Bale flawlessly plays the role of Trevor reznick, a machinist who is withering away because he refuses to eat or sleep. It really messes with your head at some points but it has many Christian subliminal messages in it. i can not tell you about the Christian tones in this movie without spoiling the hole film for you, but if you are Christian i would watch it. Even the film poster shows that there are very subtle Christian references in it by putting a cross over Christian bales face on the movie poster! i would recommend this film to fans of Christian bale or fans of psychological drama films! It really was a very interesting character study and it is now one of my favorite films! Bravo!",10,0,1,17 August 2014
No Country for Old Men," No country for old men review.
",this was a great film. Javier bardem is great as the mass murdering Anton chigurh who seems to be borderline insane. It has great acting and a good plot. This movie is extremely fast moving and seems to only last seconds. it is made in an extremely different style that the coen brothers other movies though. there is something missing in the film that i cant put my finger on... but it is still a good film it is not in my top 50 but it is still a great film. I would recommend this to people that like fast moving thrillers. Also josh brolin and tommy lee jones give great performances. it was a great and truly unique thriller that any film buff should see.,7,0,0,1 July 2014
Dog Day Afternoon," Why Dog Day Afternoon is so great!
",In this review I will explain why the film Dog Day afternoon is so great. 1) It has great acting from Al Pacino and John Cazale. 2) It takes the cliché of a bank robbery gone wrong and turns it into a truly unique experience. 3) It can be an extremely suspenseful at points. 4)It has elements of a black comedy in it. 5) It has cool and funny dialog. those are my five reasons why the film dog day afternoon is so good. Fans of heist films should definitely check this classic out as soon as possible. It is worth seeing just for Al Pacinos performance. Fans of black comedy crime films such as Fargo should check it out. I am not saying that it is as good as Fargo because Fargo is amazing but dog day afternoon is still a great film.,9,0,1,1 July 2014
Donnie Brasco," Whats not to like?
",how is this film not on imdbs top 250 list? it was amazing! how could a movie like this get any negative ratings? it is just as good as movies such as goodfellas and mean streets! it had good acting a good plot and great scenes. it also had a lot of suspense and drama. its just as good as any other mob drama out there! don't listen to the negative reviews! listen to the positive ones and see this movie! it had one of johnny depps best performances! michael madsen also played a good part in this film!!!

2001: A Space Odyssey," An amazing odyssey through space!!!
",This was more than a film...... it was an EXPERIENCE!!! i loved this movie so much. only the great Stanley Kubrick could pull something like this off. i don't understand how a film like this got any negative reviews. yes the ending is a little bit confusing but it is still an amazing movie. I don't believe in evolution and evolution is one of the films main undertones but this does not take away from this cinematic masterpiece. the special effects were top notch and the acting was great. this movie is suspenseful and beautiful and makes you feel like you are accompanying the astronauts on their amazing odyssey to Jupiter. i recommend this to anyone that is in the mood for a truly amazing film.,10,3,7,1 July 2014
Pulp Fiction," A work of art!
","This Film was a work of art! Just so you know this is not your average film! it is extremely unique and original. It was made by one of my favorite directors (Quentin Tarantino) and has an A list cast! It has everything from action sequences to cool and funny dialog's to dramatic scenes. the film also has some dark comedy thrown in. This film is literally a masterpiece.

There Will Be Blood," A Superb drama film with a Christian message
","This was a great film! the acting was great, and it gave a Christian message about how greed can turn a nice hard working man into an evil person. It is about a prospector who becomes a big time oil tycoon and rejects God so he loses his way. It has beautiful cinematography and Daniel day lewis really did do a great job playing this character. Even the film poster hints that this film has a Christian message. the poster has a picture of a cross on it. It was a great film that i would recommend to Christians , fans of Daniel day lewis, or people that just want to see a fantastic film with beautiful cinematography and great acting. Daniel day lewis really did earn the Academy Award for best actor that he received.",8,0,4,14 August 2014
Jaws," An Excellent Film in every way!
","This film is excellent in every way! Robert Shaw, Roy Scheider, and Richard Dreyfuss, have great performances in this film. Robert Shaws performance stands out the most. this film also felt extremely realistic partly because the cinematography was so great it felt like you were are the boat with them hunting a killer shark! Also whenever a suspenseful moment would happen it feels like you were in danger! The soundtrack helped with the suspense also. I highly recommend this to film buffs because it is a must see and is one of the greatest! It has Adventure, suspense, action, drama, and even thriller elements in it! I always loved the ocean, so i really enjoy this film. It really does feel like you are in a boat hunt a killer great white! This film is a must see! Bravo!",10,2,4,18 August 2014

Leonardo Dicaprio gives a great performance as Cobb. the movie is just amazing! the special effects were amazing and the idea of being in a dream and being able to build your own society in a dream is cool and amazing!!! it is one of the most unique films that i have ever seen. It is hard to explain it so just see it for yourself as soon as possible.

Blade Runner," A Dazzling Sci-Fi Film!
","This film was great! the special effects were extremely realistic and Harrison Ford and Rutger Hauer had great performances! The film was a fast moving one that was filled with dazzling special effects! i find it hard to understand how anyone can dislike this film! It had great action sequences too! Harrison Ford plays a futuristic cop named rick deckard whose job is to hunt down replicants (robots with human skin) and assassinate them. they call these special cops Blade Runners. Rutger Hauer plays the leader of the gang of Replicants. Daryl Hanna also has an interesting part as one of the Replicants.

","This is now one of my favorite movies of all time. It is extremely powerful and emotional. It is one of the best war films I have ever seen!

Jackie Brown," An extremely underrated film!
","The reason that this film is highly underrated is because it is not your average Tarantino Film!. I do not mean this in a bad way. It is a brilliant film but is different then Tarantino's other films. It has an A list cast, a great director, and an interesting storyline that never has a dull moment, and it has very interesting characters. the only reason that i rated this film 8 out of ten is because when it is compared to Tarantino's other films i think his other films are not as good AS Jackie brown. Jackie Brown is still a great film but it lacks a bit of the great dialog and cool action and dark comedy scenes seen in Tarantino's other films. If you are a Tarantino fan then it is essential that you watch this because it is Tarantino's most mature film. Another reason this is underrated is because it was compared to Pulp Fiction and because pulp Fiction is the better Film between the two it was underrated because most people that watched this film set there expectations to high. If you are a Tarantino fan and have not seen this yet than you should definitely watch it",8,0,2,2 August 2014
Gangs of New York," A Great Film!
","This film was great! It had great acting performances and the acting performance that i think stands out the most is Daniel Day Lewis' performance. He plays the brutal gang leader Bill the Butcher. The actors performances alone make this film a must see. Another reason why this film is a must see is because it has good dialog and a great plot. Plus Martin Scorcese did a great job directing this film. It shows how new york was started. This film is highly underrated and i think it is a great film. Leonardo DiCaprio's performance stands out also. Any fan of Martin Scorcese, Daniel Day Lewis, or Leonardo Dicaprio should see this. Even though it is a long film it is never boring and it is very hard to lose interest in it.",10,1,1,13 August 2014
The Cabin in the Woods," A Very Original and Unique Film! Its Not really a Horror Film
",the first thing that i will say is that this film is very unique and is sort of a parody or homage to almost every genre of horror films ever made. You can not really take this film seriously. It is a parody but it is not the kind of Parody where its all funny and has tons of stupid jokes in it. It is a serious film but you could still see obvious nods to other films. I am not a big fan of horror films. i have not seen many but i saw this one because it is such a unique film and i'm getting bored of seeing films that are obviously made to be like a film that has already been made. You don't have to be a fan of horror films. you could be like me where u don't care for horror films. you should see this one because it is so original and because it has very strange plot twists. I personally dislike most horror films but like i said this is not really a horror film at all. it is a parody of them.,9,1,3,5 August 2014
Moon," A Masterpiece!!!
","Moon is a great film. If you enjoy films such as 2001 a space odyssey then you should watch it. Sam Rockwell is great as the astronaut Sam Bell. there was not a dull moment in this film. it has drama, great elements of sci-fi and suspense, and it has mystery elements also. this film was truly a masterpiece. the fact that this was the directors first film is amazing. Kevin spacey also plays an interesting role as the robot assistant Gerty 3000. this is definitely an amazing sci-fi film. The film also has great special effects and the inside of the space station looks really cool. this is a film that i am sure most people can enjoy. this film also has some eerie moments and in some parts has a lot of suspense. i cant wait to see the sequel to this that is supposedly coming out in the near future. Bravo!!!",10,2,6,28 July 2014
