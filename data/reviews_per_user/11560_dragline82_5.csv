Vertigo," Vertigo is Overrated and Stupid
","All that work just to fake the death of his wife? Get out. No one would be this stupid.Typical Hitchcock jumping the shark. Gets everything technically perfect except the premise.Even if he was running some insurance scam, dude, you've got to believe the actions he followed were the stupidest you could possibly think of.Here's what the Bad Man does in the movie:1. Includes an accomplice to murder2. Dresses that accomplice up as his dead wife3. Does endless research for backstory to make suicide look like a ghost possession4. Thinks ghost possession is better a suicide story than just you know, sadness5. Requires his accomplice give Oscar-caliber performances to a detective so the story isn't suspect6. Directly links himself with his murder via his witness, Joe Detective7. Has a romance with his accomplice, then dumps her8. The wife is already dead. He had already found a way kill her, and the best suicide idea he had was throwing her off of a church? It wouldn't be easier to just put a gun in her hand and pull the trigger? Why couldn't his mistress be a witness? Why is a witness even necessary?9. Mastermind's best plan was to hide at the crime scene in a janitor's closet while cops surrounded the jointEssentially the bad man goes way out of his way to create some implausible elaborate way to frame his wife's suicide involving another man's fear of heights, a female co-conspirator / mistress, a backstory involving ghost possession and a detailed history of his wife's specific family background up to and including hereditary mental illness. He could have easily found a better way to fake her suicide by, say, poisoning her oatmeal and forging a suicide note.This movie is stupid.Also it's boring.",6,5,16,10 October 2014
Spotlight," Not enough horsepower
","Loaded with great performances. I didn't know Liev Schreiber could be lovable. Or Stanley Tucci likable, let alone great. The main problem here is you have a story with heavy subject matter, and a realistic portrayal about how a group of journals might go about solving the problem. But the realism doesn't allow for a dramatic engaging look into the issue that gets to its core, that is hard hitting enough for the subject's weight. Basically it needed someone in the movie to go, 'It's about child rape. What's the moral grey area of that assh-les?' Instead Mark Ruffalo goes ham but not really. 'If it takes a village to raise the child, it takes a village to abuse one.' It needed more of that.",7,3,5,21 January 2016
The Hateful Eight," Tiresome Tarantino
","I finally understand why everyone talks about Tarantino. It's not that he's a great director, he's very good. It's that his experiments are more worth talking about than say, a great director's successes. You won't hear as zealous a talk over the Coen Brothers, who deserve it. You watch his movies, and as much as you think about the characters, you think about the direction. It's like a Kanye West song. Kanye West can't resist giving a shoutout to Kanye West. QT is the same. In doing this, it's hard to see his movies as actual stories, or get lost in them. That makes them shallow, and confuses what he's trying to say, if anything. There's also his need to make everything juvenile which is fine but it tends to throw off the tone, making it distracting. Also, it makes everything bloody to the point it's tiresome. Notice this is a review of the experience, not the movie. Notice you can't review a movie by him without saying Tarantino a lot. The movie has snow, a cabin, and guns. You get the picture.",7,3,11,21 January 2016
The Revenant," Inarritu gains self-esteem
","Okay, so Inarritu has amazing power but always used it to make manipulative movies with a lot of sensation (Biutiful, 21 Grams, Babel). Then he made a cynical movie about theater simply for Oscar critics that was pretty good called Birdman, won the Oscar.With that win, he finally has financial backing and self-esteem because this is his first great movie. Cinematography is beautiful and should win an award (aided by great fx).It's solid, a fun trainwreck, pretty, has heart, interweaves beautiful dream sequences coherently that help tell the story. The acting is top notch.The biggest problem is the plot is generic. There's really one plot point, and it's the oldest in the book. And anything else, yeah we already know people love their family and sh-t. Great, but not best picture good. Mad Max deserves it.",8,0,4,21 January 2016
Room," Unintentionally insulting
","This is the movie that happens every year that isn't good, but wins critical acclaim by being distinct and including a child actor. It's disturbing, but without the tact required by the writing.Now to spoil things. A woman is held hostage as a sex slave for seven years and at some point has a baby boy, who she convinces the 'Room' is the entire world. During this they play uplifting music and it is absolutely tonally daft. Once they escape Room they are better off. Then, 'Ma' feels bad about how horribly she treated her son and thus tries to kill herself, to make it all better.Also, the boy in this movie looks and sounds exactly like a girl and has long hair. So I'm expecting maybe 'Ma' lied that it was a boy, so her kid wouldn't be a rape target. Nope. Toward the end you realize it's a boy, and you go, 'Whoa, why was I distracted by that for absolutely no reason?'Then, they revisit Room. And Ma feels better. Because going to where you were repeated raped for seven years makes you happy. Absurd, ridiculous, fantastical film that is unintentionally insulting.",2,70,183,21 January 2016
