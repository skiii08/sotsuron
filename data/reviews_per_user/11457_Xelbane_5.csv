Scarface," huh
","Scarface, one of the movies that I always skipped over in the video store, I finally saw it and to be honest after all the hype i was expecting to be blown away.Sad to say this film all though well done, was just to limp to draw me in I felt now real connection to anyone in the cast. It seemed to have no real reason why tony did what he did. I need more back story, and some characters like Elvira need more of a reason to be there. The shoot outs where pretty good and i liked the end, although tony was in my opion a shallow character, died in a way that only he couldand the imfoumous chainsaw scene was pitiful at bestI think that it is not even on level with the Godfather 6 out of 10",6,0,3,16 April 2005
Finding Nemo," Pixar does it agian
","Now first off I am 18 and a graduating senior,  But that does not mean I cant enjoy kid films but pixar has turned childrens films into a art from much like big idea has with veggie tales. Finding nemo is a brillant well animated film and quite complex I would recomend anyone go see it",10,2,3,1 June 2003
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," I said I'd be back
","Ahh what can I say about this movie,   First of I was sceptical of the whole thing when they cast a girl as the bad guy I relly hoped vin diesl would have got the part but I saw the Movie and was impressed.
The thing you got to understand is this is like jurassic park three it is a none stop action packed romp no most people were expecting a film like the previous two where we new little about terminators or what they could do. in this movie it's more about survial and coming to girps with reallity.
All the preformances where supurb and arnold was amazing for being 50 he still wowed me at every turn
I recomend it for anyone like for action packed movie. 9/10",9,0,0,4 July 2003
The Fast and the Furious," Why the film industry is going to the dogs
",This film is a perfect example of a overated pice of trash. It offers nothing that a good movie needs Except for vin diesl all the acting sucks the plot is unblivable the music is stuipd.  Cars dont make good movies it was olny popular becuase of the cars. And street racing alone is not a good movie topic,1,4,9,27 January 2003
X2: X-Men United," Great flick better then last movie
","Now lots of hardcore X men fans will rag on this film becuase of lots of missing mutants I wont spiol it for those who have not seen it but if you know your x men they are there.
Dont listen to those poeple the dicector once agian took a topic that very few new about or liked and made it into a great film.  The preformance were top notch the best goes to hugh jackman for a dead on comic to flim interpritaion of wolvierine.
Plus pyro and Iceman are great way to show some realy cool special effects.over all I give the movie a 9/10  go see it for an exciting thrill",9,0,0,2 May 2003
