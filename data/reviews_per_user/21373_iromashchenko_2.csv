Blade Runner 2049," Praiseworthy sequel of a cult sci-fi film
","This is so good that Denis Villeneuve took the task to make the sequel here. Probably, he is the best candidate for this role. The great operator Roger Dickens and composer Hans Zimmer have well accompanied him. Still the Canadian director has not managed to reach the level of the original. The new Bladerunner is beautiful from many perspectives. Popular and talented actors, amazing antiutopian landscapes, intriguing plot. Villeneuve even managed to insert several unexpected turns. The atmosphere of the first part has been preserved and developed. The same cynical and acid world, where replicates live next to people. The authors have made a solid job by giving a deep thought to the film's background having embodied it in three viral short movies. This was not only a well- mastered move, but also a pleasant gift to all cine lovers. In other words, this is high quality fantastic movie, which cannot be observed every day. To a large extent it reminds Spielberg's Minority Report. Both were shot after the works of Philip K. Dick. As opposed to the Minority Report, Bladerunner 2049 has one, but serious fault. It is less original than the first one. Undoubtedly this is a talented and unbelievable sequel, but its effect is much weaker than of the first joint. The first Bladerunner has once shaken the world of sci-fi. The viewer has so many times seen fantastic worlds, analogous to the one shown in the Bladerunner that today the first film seems a bit primitive. This nonetheless should not underestimate its historical significance. In general there is no willingness to criticize the new Villeneuve movie. He has truly managed to do something beyond what other directors could have done – to produce a sequel one may not be ashamed of.",8,1,8,13 October 2017
American Made," Satirical bio from Doug Liman
","'American Made' is about a US pilot who managed to work both for the CIA and for the Medelin cartel in Colombia, and later – for the DEA. The CIA received valuable pictures of military bases in the South America and supplied weapons to the local anti-communist groups, while cartel sent drugs to the US. These illegal operations allowed Seal to gain wealth, but it has not guaranteed him long and easy life. One needs to know one thing about the movie. Doug Liman is a director here. A director with recognizable style. He has authored famous actions movies, including 'The Bourne Identity', 'Mr. and Mrs. Smith' and 'The Edge of Tomorrow'. Tom Cruise starred the latter one, by the way. Contrary to the previous works in 'American Made' Liman is forced to put up the level and to discuss serious topics in his light manner. This is not the first time, when the director refers to complicated themes ('Fair Game'), but before it looked less persuasive. The joint mostly creates associations with another satirical bio, 'Wolf of Wall-Street' from Scorsese. Well, one can hardly compete with Scorsese in deepness and multidimensional coverage, but still methods used here by Liman very much remind those ones Scorsese used earlier. Of course, a reservation has to be made that some real facts were changed to simplify the plot and to give the movie more artistic attractiveness. Also this movie would hardly become the most favorite one for the audience as it could happen to 'Bourne Identity' and 'Mr. and Mrs. Smith'. Nevertheless, this is one of the best movies of the year and a praiseworthy return of Tom Cruise into dramatic acting (after 'The Mummy').",8,1,3,20 October 2017
