Angels & Demons," A movie for Forrest Gumps
","This movie uses trade recipes widely applied: lots of 'research' (without any understanding), standard US plot devices ('just in time', 'role reversal', etc.) and actors who are actually not bad. Why is it then than one thinks to have wasted one's time by watching it? It probably owes it to its utter incapacity to suspend your disbelief. Even in Disney movies you are capable of believing what is being related. Here you don't. Brown should write sitcoms, he simply is unable to write captivating and credible scripts. This movie may have a marginal usefulness, though. If you liked it, chances are your IQ is below 70...",2,1,4,3 January 2010
Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Unspeakable drivel - quite surprising!
","I am appalled by reputable friends who tell me this movie was great... Let's see, even if I risk repeating something already said in this thread:1. this type of humour seems very likely to appeal only to people with an IQ possibly lower than 60;2. the purported mocking of the Americans is just not there, or else is again of such a crude fashion that I couldn't care less; 3. I also couldn't care less about the lead actor being Jewish: he is not funny and he is not the first (I can't stand Woody Allen either, as his movies, far from talking about universal values, are essentially only intelligible to Manhattan Jews, because of his culture-related jokes and references); 4. being cruel about people who have a hard life, like the Kazakhs right now, is not funny at all.In sum, I detested every moment of it (actually of the first 10 mins; I could not bear more).By the way, I am neither Jew, nor Arab, nor neo-Nazi and have not a political agenda. I believe that if you have some common sense you are entitled to detest this low-level nonsense.Am going to vote it 1, hoping to turn the tsunami around...",1,8,16,15 January 2007
Mr. Nobody," Much ado about nothing
","This is a movie that tries to be too many things: science-fiction, avant-garde, raised awareness, alternate histories etc. It does not manage: the final result, as served to the hapless viewer, is a gray goo of too many strands, very difficult to follow. The director set out to do many things. Perhaps he actually managed, but the result, neither original nor impressive, is impossible to watch. Also, 2 hrs 35 min may be justified for Angelopoulos, who invariably has a story to tell and will do so at his pace, or perhaps for Röhmer, who will show you the waves hitting the surf line for five minutes, after some intense moment.This guy is nowhere near Angelopoulos or Röhmer. A number of Belgians who have reviewed it very positively may have been influenced by the country of birth of the director (Belgium, you guessed...).",2,20,43,18 July 2010
Avatar," A very moving and powerful love story
","Cameron is an innovative director and he surely has lots of talent for, inter alia, creative CGI uses. However, not being American, I fail to be particularly impressed by the dazzling CGI that this movie contains. Inventing a brand new world is something any decent science fiction writer does, with words, not CGI.I am much more impressed by a very powerful love story, where love transcends everything: race, space, time, physical limitations, etc. Although set in a bit too gung-ho environment, this love story is the core strand you should follow, and it will move you, as it moved me. A very powerful and unforgettable love story.",9,4,9,25 December 2009
Sherlock Holmes," A steampunk farcical desecration
","For all those who actually have a clue about Sherlock Holmes, this desecration proves that Hollywoood is a dangerous bio-toxin: it kills what it touches. How could they possibly cast an American who doesn't even feel remotely English as Sherlock Holmes (anybody can spell Jeremy Brett?)or Jude Law for the slow-witted Dr Watson? The inane plot, probably whizzed up in a night of Californian fake 'champagne' and some controlled substances, has nothing whatsoever to do with any Conan Doyle story, and is seated in a heavily steampunked London, which is a past of not our future, with a number of anachronistic details (radio is mentioned, guns look Far West improved by Luger Corp., pocket watches are of at least 50 years later build, etc). It also exhibits a number of holes the size of a whale. You will be delighted to learn that the finishing touch is to mix in a vaguely Masonic evil secret society à la Angels and Demons. Steer absolutely clear, put sandbags and barbed wire on your DVD player and refuse to get involved with this reinvented chemically pure drivel.",2,3,5,17 May 2010
