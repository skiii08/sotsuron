The Perks of Being a Wallflower," Fairly realistic
","The initial set-up of the storyline resembles a usual teen chick flick. Much to my surprise, the rest of it is not like that at all.The time-frame for the story seems to be the one when I was a high school fresher, so I was quite curious to see if I can relate to anything I see in this movie. Granted, there are some elements of the plot that are inevitable in any high-school movie that is based on trials and tribulations of social misfits.However, the characters are certainly not portrayed as childishly egoistic as they appear in most teen movies. In fact, the level of maturity of the main characters, the types of issues that they are forced to deal with, as well as the outcomes of typical conflicts in a high-school setting all look fairly realistic.The acting is quite good, in my layman view.The only reason why I would not give it a ten out of ten is the absence of humour. It appears as if there is too much effort being placed on avoidance of cheesy scenes. However, funny is not necessarily a synonym for cheap. That aside, this is a highly recommendable film.",9,1,2,10 February 2013
The Notebook," Overly sentimental, but not boring
","Having seen the relatively high score by both the public at large and the critics, as far as a romance movie goes, I had had pretty high expectations. Unfortunately, I was disappointed. It is clear from the very beginning that the intention of the movie was to get viewers' eyes well up with tears in response to over-the-top sentimentality. At the end of the movie, I felt neither entertained nor in any way enlightened. It seems that 'The Notebook' is trying to tell us that the true love happens only once in a lifetime and we can all guess what the rest of the message is. Granted, the love story is presented without too many clich√©s, in the very beginning at least. In sum, if you are into overly sentimental romantic dramas, this is a movie for you. Otherwise, it's not terrible to watch, but far from great.",4,1,1,28 January 2013
Easy A," Not an ordinary teen chick flick
","The movie deals with the well-rehearsed topic of trying to fit in. Of course, the key message of the movie is that one's personal life is not supposed to be a competitive field. However, the way it deals with the key topic makes this film special. I personally like that the lead character is someone that a lot of people can relate to, as opposed to being either a super-popular cheerleader or an ultra-dorky outsider.The acting is good, although some characters are blown out of proportions. However, this is a usual flaw of teen movies and certainly not a major issue in this particular case.The only downside, albeit slight, is that the movie does not really abound in comic scenes. This makes it somewhat forgettable, as a film either offers an intellectual challenge or stirs up emotions (sorrow or joy, either way) in order to be memorable. That is the sole reason why I give it a 9 as opposed to a clean 10.",9,1,1,2 February 2013
