Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," This will be the Balance of the Force
","This was a great movie. People will disagree but come on, how was this supposed to live up to the hype. People where getting info on the movie a year before its release and the internet was crazy with the summary plot. i myself knew the plot before i watched it and it did ruin in a little but i still loved it. People said that it started slow, No way it was action from the moment of the scroll down.The Movie followed a simular pattern to The Empire Strikes Back where it starts off quick, slows in the middle and hits light speed near the end.This movie had a little bit of everything from the other movies. It followed the Empire pattern, was like star wars as all the characters where introduced but was more like  return of the Jedi  with the children being the main audience.Critics said that the acting was very wooden especially Natalie Portman and jake Lloyd, well for one Natalie is playing a queen and maybe her character is supposed to be wooden? for example look at Queen Elizabeth, not the most animated person on earth is she, and Jake Lloyd, well he is only 9 and the character is not the average day kid, he has had to put up with a lot in his short life so maybe he can deal with his emotions better than most.The Plot of Ep1 was also under scrutiny by the Critics (funny how they didnt have a problem with Titanic) well other than this movie introducing the characters it also had a sub plot, that being how Sidious screwed everyone around, He backstabbed not only the Trade Federation but also got where he wanted to be in the first place, the leader of the republic, really when you think about it what would he have to gain from invading Naboo other than getting political power.I think for a movie that was a huge target for the critics from day one it has held up its own. Once again the Critics got it wrong, but anyone who listens to what critics say need professional help anyway. This movie has broke box office records and although not the most voted for movie at the moment will get a higher rating as the years go by. This is a classic and i cant wait for the next two.",10,0,0,27 September 1999
