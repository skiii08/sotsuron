The King's Speech," Hopefully Firth's Next Speech Will Be At The Oscar Podium
","In the cannon of Cinema's offerings which detail the lives of those seemingly otherworldly creatures known as Royalty, whether the subject be real or imagined, we are usually confronted with a very conventional protagonist-the brave, beguiling, determined aristocrat who is either desperately attempting to grasp power or desperately attempting to hold onto it. Whether it be King Henry the Eighth, Queen Elizabeth or the fictional King John, the portrayal of these characters are always imbued with a certain sense of either subtle or overt arrogance, as if the position of almost indeterminable power and privilege is theirs by divine right. What makes The King's Speech not only fascinating but indeed refreshing is that it chronicles the story of a man who not only has no wish to be on the throne but is absolutely terrified at the prospect of it.The film tells the story of the man who would become King George VI (Bertie), the mild mannered, reserved 'spare' to the throne who suffers from a dreadful stammer. As second in line, Bertie is confident that he will never be required to assume the role which he dreads, but as a member of the royal family he is regularly required to make public speeches, an event which both terrifies and embarrasses him deeply. Bertie's supportive wife Elizabeth enlists the help of maverick speech therapist Lionel Logue whose unconventional treatment techniques slowly begin to instill in Bertie the confidence in which he is so sorely lacking. Things take a turn for the worst however when Bertie's brother David abdicates the throne to marry scandalous American divorcée Wallace Simpson. As the country verges ever closer to war with Germany, Lionel and Bertie's relationship is stretched to breaking point.This is Colin Firth's film, and if there is any justice the next speech he should be making will be from the winner's podium at the Academy Awards. Playing a protagonist afflicted with a stammer was risky business for both Firth and director Tom Hooper. Indeed, they pulled of quite a fete in the fact that the affliction never gets in the way of the story, it fills the viewer with sympathy not frustration and it never comes across as comical; which in the hands of a lesser actor it might have done. In movies such as this, the phoenix rising from the ashes so to speak, it would have been only to easy for Firth to really chew up the scenery which thankfully the actor wisely refrains from doing so. Firth plays Bertie with such a subtle poignancy, his pain always just underneath the surface that it is like poetry to watch. Much like his performance in A Single Man, it is the restraint shown in Firth's choices that truly showcase what a remarkable actor he is.As Logue, the eccentric Australian speech therapist Geoffery Rush proves once again why he is one of the all time greats. Rush is similar to Firth in that they both appear to follow the same credo of he who screams and cries the most does not the best actor make. Their less is more approach shows that both are more willing to serve the film rather than their ego's. Their on screen chemistry is one of the true joys of the movie, with the unconventional friendship eliciting both hilarity and tears in equal measure. If nothing else, Tom Hooper should be praised for capturing on celluloid two actors at the peak of their talent and ingenuity.Rounding out the leads is one of cinema's most interesting leading ladies, Helena Bonham Carter as Queen Elizabeth. Carter's off screen persona is possibly about as far removed as you can get from the notion that the majority of us carry around about the Queen Mum; and yet Bonham Carter's unquestionable talent wins through in the end, her bearing and diction so regal that it is quite a pity a coronation isn't around the corner for the actress herself. It is a very different character from the rather unhinged, larger than life creations Carter has become known for in the past decade. The actress herself stated in interviews that she was unsure about the role because at first she thought it was just another supportive wife part. Yet in Carter's hands, Elizabeth appears a woman before her time, an equal with her husband, supportive and yet not relegated to the background.Tom Seidler's script is superb. There is a lot of history to cover in the comparatively short running time of one hour and fifty minutes, not to mention the emotional subtext which must be present in order to make the film resonate as it should. Seidler does well to avoid for the most part the generic cliché's associated with films of this nature. Bertie is a flawed man, he will always remain a flawed man, as the film progresses he improves rather than is cured. He has triumphs of sorts but they are personal rather than political . Perhaps this is one of the reasons why the film has such emotional resonance. The majority of us can not relate to heroic grasps for power, but we can relate to small victories, overcoming the fear and adversity inside us all. Seidler restrains the urge to turn Berie into what we usually perceive to be a Hero. He is rather a rather ordinary man doing the best he can in extraordinary circumstances. The narrative flows seamlessly, always gripping, every scene essential.There is no getting around the fact that The King's Speech is a crowd pleaser, which may be slightly damaging to its reputation in the fact that the only type of film which seems to be considered art these days are pretentious morality tales with unstructured narratives, scenery chewing theatrics and a lot of gratuitous sex and violence. If The King's Speech takes home the best picture Oscar than it will be a much deserved honor indeed. http://rantsreviews4filmnuts.blogspot.com/",10,1,2,23 December 2010
Whip It," Don't Count On Wanting To Spend Another Round In The Ring
","The news that Drew Barrymore was about to make her directorial debut was greeted with a fair amount of skepticism within the industry. Her freshman effort however is not the complete clunker predicted by many nor does it herald a highly anticipated new career path for Barrymore. Instead she delivers a predictable and mediocre coming of age yarn that is not worthy of the talent it attracted.The movie follows the girl to woman transformation of Bliss Cavendar (Ellen Page). Forced to participate in beauty pageants by her overbearing mother (Marcia Gay Harden) social misfit Bliss finds herself much more at home in the rough and tumble world of Roller Derby's. Facing strong opposition from her parents Bliss makes it her mission in life to join the local league and become her own person.Whip It boasts an all star cast, although you have to wonder whether or not they would have even considered the material had Barrymore not been behind the helm. Perpetually misunderstood youth Ellen Page essentially plays Bliss Cavendar as Juno without the confidence (or the pregnancy). Despite this Page is obviously talented and makes the character likable enough, however she is completely upstaged by Arrested Development star Alia Shawkat who completely outshines Page's Oscar nominated behind as her wise cracking best friend Pash. Veteran actors Marcia Gay Harden and Daniel Stern are comically brilliant as Bliss's well intentioned parents with Juliette Lewis making us realise that she's one of best and most under appreciated actors working today as Bliss's devilish rival Iron Maven. Rounding out the supporting cast is rapper turned actor Eve, Tarantino stunt women extraordinaire Zoe Bell, Barrymore herself and the forgotten Wilson brother Andrew.One of the biggest problems with Whip It is it's pacing. At times the film seems to drag on endlessly, making you question why a rather simple plot takes almost two hours to unfold. The more enjoyable moments come from the friendship between Bliss and Pash as well as the actual Roller Derby matches themselves. Barrymore succeeds so well in making you feel as though you are inside the ring that you can almost smell the sweat and blood. However these moments are often few and far between and we must instead watch a poorly developed and rather pointless love story unfold between Bliss and local musician Oliver as well as numerous sequences showcasing how 'wild' the derby girls are (they skate and wear heavy make -up, we get it!) Barrymore's direction is certainly not bad, it just comes across as a little schizophrenic. It's almost as though she really wasn't quite sure what the end product should be, as such we are introduced to too many themes and ideas. While no great prodigy she should certainly be given another chance at directing as there is obvious potential evident. Barrymore certainly manages to elicit fine performances from her cast and should be applauded for the fact that she didn't turn Whip It into a self serving vanity project as most other actor/directors have a tendency to do.Whilst nothing spectacular, Whip It is nonetheless enjoyable fare. Just don't count on wanting to spend another round in the ring. For more reviews please feel free to visit http://rantsreviews4filmnuts.blogspot.com/",5,5,12,20 November 2009
Shutter Island," You won't want to close the shutters on this one!!
","FOR MORE REVIEWS FEEL FREE TO VISIT http://rantsreviews4filmnuts.blogspot.com/ The dream team of Scorsese and Dicaprio deliver their most thrilling and original effort yet in the form of the physcological mindfield that is Shutter Island.US Marshal Teddy Daniels is called to a remote island to investigate the disappearance of a murderess from an institute for the criminally insane. Upon arrival Daniels soon begins to realise that nothing is as it seems, nobody can be trusted and danger lurks around every corner.Like Shutter Island the location, Shutter Island as a film is a rich tapestry of intrigue in which the viewer never feels safe in it's presence. Also like the island itself you never quite know what to expect from the film or even how to define it. As the story unfolds the genre you think you are watching is constantly evolving. Is it gritty film noir, closed circled crime fiction, cop drama or sensationalised pulp? Nobody knows genre better than Martin Scorsese and this very gift enables him to mess with the viewers expectations as he presents us with convention and then turns it upside down.When it comes to suspense Shutter Island by far surpasses all other cinematic offerings of the past decade. From the opening scene to the rolling of the credits the viewer is bombarded with a plethora of plot twists, red herrings and interconnected sub plots as the narrative grows deeper and more intense. To discuss said narrative would merely spoil the experience for the viewer as the total unpredictability of the films plot is one of it's finest assets.Dicaprio once again turns in an awards worthy turn as the films damaged protagonist Teddy Daniels. Few actors can emote so much in such a subtle manner without chewing the scenery. The pain expressed in Dicaprio's eyes will haunt you for long after the lights come up. Daniels narrative is complex but Dicaprio handles the progression of his character like the pro that he is. It is hoped that Dicaprio doesn't follow in his directors footsteps in being relegated to always being the bridesmaid for the coveted Oscar. Fingers crossed that Shutter Island remains in voters minds for the 2011 awards ceremony as Dicaprio's performance is one of the best of this or any year. Mark Ruffalo lends excellent support as Daniels partner Chuck Aule. It's definitely Ruffalo's best performance to date and one hopes that he will be offered more roles of substance after this outing. Rounding out the supporting class is the suitably intriguing Ben Kingsly as the resident head physcologist, a scene stealing Ted Levine as a suspicious warden and Michelle Williams as Daniels deceased wife. Brief cameos by Jackie Earle Haley as a patient and Patricia Clarkson as a mystery woman are masterclass acting at it's finest and enrich the quality of the picture.Cinematographer Robert Richardson does a superb job of making Shutter Island the foreboding and maze of fear that it appears to be. All other departments also seem to come up trumps with the epic musical score of the picture in need of a notable mention.Shutter Island is one of the most original, unsettling and thought provoking film experiences you are ever likely to get. The intricacy of the plot plays out like clockwork, showcasing film making at it's finest. One of the must sees of the year and definitely worthy of being considered a modern classic, here's hoping the Dicaprio/Scorsese partnerships continues for years to come.",10,1,14,20 February 2010
2012," A Disaster Film In More Ways Than One
","Roland Emmerich's latest overblown 'look it's the end of the world, what we need is the most average guy you can find with a dysfunctional family to save the day' offering almost borders on satire as we are inundated with everything that is ridiculous about the disaster genre repeatedly over the course of almost three hours.The year is 2012 (obviously) and the world as we know it is coming to an end via a succession of natural disasters. The film chronicles mankind's struggle to survive.It's a shame that the films of Roland Emmerich have become increasingly overblown and self indulgent over the years, for he once showed great promise in being able to intertwine solid dramatic content with large action sequences in his earlier outings like The Patriot. However as 2012 and last years dreadful 10000BC show, Emmerich has forgone all ambition of producing anything of quality, instead seeming more concerned with producing the most mind numbing special effects that the ridiculously large budget of 200 million dollars could buy. It's painfully obvious where most of Emmerich's attentions lay as the multiple human narratives in 2012 fall shockingly flat.We all expect disaster movies to be somewhat ridiculous. After all they are so formulaic that the only thing that really changes is the disaster itself. 2012 is no exception as we once again are presented a bunch of stereotypical characters attempting to survive a flurry of natural disasters whilst mending their relationships. But the problem with 2012 is not so much that it adheres to every disaster movie convention in the book, but rather that we are subjected to sit through them for almost three hours. The plot is littered with so many pointless characters, sub plots and 'we're a family' pep talks that the running time is unforgivable. In between the tidal waves and earth tremors the film lags endlessly, so much so that you are actually welcoming the complete annihilation of the world so you can leave. It also appears that Emmerich wasn't sure what tone he wanted for the film. On the one hand he tries to add in a plethora of 'emotional scenes', exploring-in a bad after school special sort of way- the big issues of corporate greed, heroism, self sacrifice, redemption and science and religion. On the other hand he adds in so many cheesy one liners, cringe worthy dialogue and absurd set ups e.g a Russian Paris Hilton look a like risking her life for her chihuahua , that you can't help but think the joke may be on us.Unfortunately the cast can't do much to elevate the enjoyment factor of the film. Let's face it, disaster films are paycheck films and in exchange for the millions paid to them the actors do their best to look serious. John Cusack (the reluctant hero), Amanda Peet (his estranged wife), and relative newcomer Chiwetel Ejiofor (the scientist) do their best to make their stock disaster movie characters look suitably worried throughout, but the relatively bad dialogue and ridiculous situations more than renders any attempt to give a worthwhile performance futile. Oliver Platt does his best to stand out as the token greedy bureaucrat whilst Woody Harrelson provides some comic relief as a drugged up conspiracy theorist. It's Thandi Newton however who receives the award for the most pointless role of the year, as the presidents daughter (much like her role in W) Newton seems to merely hover in all the major scenes contributing nothing.Whilst the film fails on many levels the special effects department manages to deliver. Cinematographer Dean Semler manages to make tidal waves and earthquakes almost beautiful in their destructive glory.If your in the mood for some mindless bit of fun and don't mind a sore backside then you may enjoy 2012. For everyone else perhaps wait for DVD when you can employ the use of the fast forward button on your remote control.

Kick-Ass," It Kick's Ass!
","For more reviews head to http://rantsreviews4filmnuts.blogspot.com/ Superheros, caped crusaders, masked avengers, latex wearing super studs. Why is it that these paragons of righteous humanity only exist in our dreams? The main point of Kick Ass is to show us that superheroes don't exist in our modern world for a very good reason. Kick Ass is a parody of the insanely popular comic book adaptations that have been bombarding our theatres since the release of Spiderman back in 2001. The satirical elements of the film seem to be lost on a large number of critics who have branded the film with all kinds of damaging labels; 'exploitative', 'gratuitously violent', and 'politically incorrect' to name but a few. Of course Kick Ass is all of these things. But the film has a different motive for being so than your normal run of the mill action pick.Kick Ass tells the story of Dave Lizewski, an avid comic book fan who wonders why no-one has ever thought of becoming a superhero? The constantly unnoticed and downtrodden Dave decides to do what others only dream of and create a crime fighting alter ego Kick Ass. Dave soon realises that being a superhero is harder than he thought, especially after only narrowly escaping with his life on many occasions. Dave's problems escalate when Mafia kingpin Frank D'Amico thinks Kick Ass is behind a slew of recent drug busts that is actually the work of real vigilantes Big Daddy and Hit Girl.Unlike most comic book adaptations Kick Ass does not glorify violence. The graphic nature of the fight scenes serve to humanize the actions. They do not appear heroic, just a big bloody mess. The film also explores the consequences of violence. Every time our hero engages in a battle he is beaten to a bloody pulp and only narrowly escapes with his life.Most of the flack received by the film centre's around the character of eleven year old, foul mouthed vigilante Hit Girl. Why exactly is it that this character has received condemnation from family groups worldwide, especially since the MA 15+ film has never been marketed as anything less than strictly adult entertainment? Sure Hit Girl is like a pint sized Rambo, but is she any more disturbing than the mass murdering, psychopathic child in Orphan? The sociopathic, serial killer played by Macaulay Culkin in The Good Soon? A callous, bloodthirsty Kirsten Dunst in Interview with the Vampire? There are countless other examples of child exploitation, but Kick Ass seems to be the film taking the beating. The fact that director Matthew Vaughn is making the point that Hit Girl is a product of our increasingly violent culture seems to be lost on most naysayers. He makes the statement that superhero films glorify violence so much that in our society it is perfectly within the realms of possibility for an eleven year old to wish for guns and knives for her birthday.Kick Ass is a rollicking good farce and anyone who attempts to view it as a straight up action film is going to have trouble. It successfully pokes fun at many generic superhero conventions; the death of a loved one, the arrival of a superpower (which in Dave's case is a slightly heightened ability to take pain due to nerve damage sustained in a fight), the superhero costume ( a green scuba suit which Dave attempts to wear underneath his clothes at all times), the training regime, the nerd boy who likes popular girl, the showdown and the inevitable sequel setup.The cast is exceptional. Nicholas Cage gives his best performance in years as Big Daddy, Chloe Moretz almost steals the film as Hit Girl, Christopher Mintz- Plasse brings the laughs as Red Mist and Mark Strong delivers another exceptional villain. The film's star Aaron Johnson continues to show his versatility as an actor, possessing the humility to make Dave pathetic enough that the audience just can't help but root for him.Kick Ass is a unique film that deserves to find a large audience. Here's hoping that audiences will get past the controversy and be able to view the film for the delightful romp that it is.",9,4,14,1 May 2010
The Twilight Saga: New Moon," Chris Weitz Saves Himself From A Mauling
","Weitz delivers a solid and faithful adaptation of Stephanie Meyer's insanely popular novel. Whilst keeping in tact much of what was good about the book, unfortunately a few faults were transferred over as well.In New Moon Bella is left nursing a broken heart after her beloved Edward skips town. Fearing he was putting her in constant danger Edward broke of their romance, leaving Bella's childhood friend Jacob Black to pick up the pieces. As their relationship grows increasingly complicated, Bella is amazed to discover that Jacob is harboring a secret of his own.The Twilight novels were always destined to work better as films than as books, mainly due to the fact that we are spared Meyer's unfortunate habit of waffling on e.g Bella's miserable, for the next one hundred pages I'm going to keep baffling on about just how miserable she is in case you missed the basic idea of the concept. Screenwriter Melissa Rosenberg once again does a superb job of adapting Meyer's novels by snappily summarising the poorly paced book, mostly retaining the charm and skipping the yarn. Unfortunately like the book, the middle of the film seems to drag on, but this does seem unavoidable considering how true to events Rosenberg's script remained. New Moon is also flawed in the fact that, like the first film, many serious moments appear unintentionally funny which serves to dampen the quality of the picture.After the relative Ishtar that was the Golden Compass, Chris Weitz has managed a return to form proving he can be trusted with a big budget and beloved source material. Weitz manages to retain much of what was loved about the first Catherine Hardwick adaptation-snappy dialogue with a unique balance of light and dark moments-whilst putting his own visual imprint on the film. Also remaining from the first film are the cast which has a lot to do with the Twihards acceptance of Weitz's vision.Kristen Stewart once again pulls of the inordinate task of making the insufferable character of Bella from the novel like able. Stewart brings a certain strength to the character that is sorely lacking in the books. Robert Pattinson however is devoid of the charm and charisma that made his first outing as Edward so memorable. In Pattinson's defence the character is chronically depressed and mopey throughout the film. However, as you watch the gamut of his acting abilities range from a frown to a scowl and back again you can't help but get the impression that he doesn't really want to be there, and considering the constant hysteria and media attention that plagues the actor's personal life, perhaps he doesn't. This film was Taylor Lautner's time to shine and he makes the most of his opportunity. As Jacob Black he brings great warmth and likability (as well as some crazy muscles) to the role that makes him a real competitor for Bella's affections. As an audience member you almost dare to think the impossible- perhaps Bella would be better of with this quintessential boy next door than the perpetual sad sack she pines for throughout the film. The rest of the supporting cast once again do well to add most of the comic relief to the film. New addition Michael Sheen as Volturi leader Aro proves why he is one of the most in demand British actors in the business, whilst child prodigy Dakota Fanning turns in a suitably creepy performance as the sadistic Jane.New Moon is visually stunning. Cinematographer Javier Aguirresarobe manages to give the dreary town of Forks a lush, almost otherworldly quality. The beautiful visual quality is emphasized when the story shifts to Italy and we are inundated by majestic scenery and vibrant colors. The only real disappointment are the quite poorly done CGI werewolves which looked about as real as Pamela Anderson's breasts.All in all Twilight fanatics should be pleased with the latest installment and Summit Entertainment should sit back, relax and start counting the Benjamen's.

Avatar," Bang For Your Buck
","Deja-vu anyone? Overblown budget, cutting edge special effects, rumors that Cameron had lost the plot, rumors that this was to be an Ishtar for the ages. Yes, history seemed to be repeating itself during the shoot for James Cameron's latest eye popping thrill ride Avatar. But instead of sinking like the ship in Cameron's now comically iconic predecessor, Avatar comes up trumps.Sam Worthington stars as Jake Sulley, a paraplegic marine who is promised the use of his legs back in exchange for infiltrating the community of the native people of planet Pandora and gathering information to necessitate their downfall. As he grows to love his new way of life Sulley becomes conflicted between following orders and protecting his new people.I didn't expect to like this film. In fact i expected to hate it considering Avatar combines two of my least favorite genres- science fiction and animation-coupled with a mammoth running time. But James Cameron has managed to create such a visually magnificent feast for the eyes that you would be hard pressed not to become engaged by what is playing out before you.Cameron takes the art of motion capture CGI to new heights of excellence, producing quality of colour and dimension the likes of which has yet to be seen. The planet of Pandora is an exotic paradise, so lush with native flora and fauna that you long to jump through the screen and touch it. The animated characters are more emotive and realistic than ever before thanks to this new technology which allows every nuance of the actor's facial expressions to be captured and transferred onto the screen.Sam Worthington does well in the lead. Whilst his performance is nothing exceptional, he makes a solid effort at holding the film together. The fact that you are always routing for Sulley despite his conflicted loyalties is a testament to Worthington's likability. However the real show stealer is Zoe Saldana, quite a feat considering her character is entirely animated. As Neytiri, Jake's Na'vi love interest Saldana's emotions are so incredibly powerful that they blast straight through the screen, enabling the audience to relate to the film on a much more basic human level. Another notable mention has to go to Sigourney Weaver, re-teaming with the man who brought her initial super stardom twenty-three years ago, she plays Dr Grace Augustine, a scientist with an innate love for the native people of Pandora. Her performance reminds us why she is one of the best actresses around for bringing strong, independent female characters to life on the big screen. Rounding out the cast is Stephen Lang as the larger than life, ultimate film villain Colonel Miles Quaritch. Lang hams it up big time, but this serves the character well.The majority of Avatar's appeal lays within the visual aspects of the film. Cameron's script is not great. The dialogue is rather bland and the story formulaic. The nearly three hour running time is mainly for visual showcasing rather than allowing the quite simple plot to unfold. The films underlying themes of corporate greed, science and religion and the adverse affect of man on nature are hammered home in a loud and obvious way. Yet Avatar still possesses more of an emotional pull than most big budgeted action epics manage to communicate.This film may not be for everyone, but even Cameron's greatest cynics must give the man props for his vision. If you dislike the genre the running time might get to you, but even so you'd be hard pressed not to feel like you got plenty of bang for your buck.

Sherlock Holmes," Anything But Elementary
","FOR MORE REVIEWS FEEL FREE TO VISIT http://rantsreviews4filmnuts.blogspot.com/ Fresh from the superbly crafted RocknRolla, Guy Ritchie churns out a hugely entertaining, high voltage thrill ride which is by far the most superior popcorn movie of the year.After the capture and execution of criminal mastermind Lord Blackwood, reports surface that the evil genius has somehow risen from the grave. With Watson in tow Sherlock Holmes sets about solving a series of murders somehow related to the case whilst dealing with an old flame who has mysteriously re-entered his life.Over the course of the film every pre-conceived notion you thought you had about Holmes mythology flies out the door (for the better i might add) as Ritchie's vision contains far more laughs, action and thrills than poor old Basil Rathbone or any other Holmes imitator could ever hope to imagine. For want of a better word Holmes and Watson kick butt, majorly. Not many directors do action better than Guy Ritchie and the sequences in the film has his unique stamp all over them.The film gets off to a cracking good start, both fast paced and intriguing. Unfortunately it begins to meander during the middle as the increasing number of elements to the case become more and more convoluted. The film also spends more time setting up for a sequel than other movie in recent memory. The faceless villain Moriarty, who is all set to be Holmes next nemesis, nearly gets as much screen time as Lord Blackwood! Despite the poorly paced second half, the chemistry between Robert Downey Jr and Jude Law is enough to keep you watching.Downey Jr makes the role of the infamous detective all his own whilst retaining much of what made Holmes so special in the first place; superior intellect,wit, arrogance and petulance. Physically Downey Jr is about as different as you can get from the popular yet unsubstantiated Holmes iconography that we are usually presented with in adaptions. Yet this new Holmes is so darn likable that you really wouldn't want him any other way. Jude Law is also a far cry from the image of the balding, middle aged doctor we usually associate with Watson. Law invigorates the role, playing seamlessly off Downey Jr. Their relationship is reminiscent of the great buddy films of yesteryear and is one of the highlights of the movie.The supporting cast does not fare as well. The usually scene stealing Mark Strong is kind of a ho-hum villain. We do not spend enough time with his character or know enough about him to consider him a real threat, especially after sitting through endless acts of genius by Holmes, you never really fear that he will get the better of the wonder detective. Rachel McAdams is also miscast as Irene Adler, Holmes love interest and rival. Adams does not possess the maturity in her performance to make you feel as though she is the street savvy, criminal genius that she is made out to be.The look of the film is fantastic. Cinematographer Philippe Rousselot does a superb job at capturing 19th century London in all it's glory; from the docks, to the gritty mean streets to even Buckingham Palace, the film is rich in colour and authenticity. Ritchie's frequent editor James Herbert is back, bringing with him the techniques that make the film look typically Ritchie esquire. From the action sequences to the interweaving of past and present timelines, the editing is top shelf. To round of the high quality productions is super composer Hans Zimmer's musical score, which is one of the best of the year and adds to the overall excitement of the picture.So if your in the mood for a rollicking, fun filled adventure flick that is anything but elementary, you won't do much better than Sherlock Holmes this holiday season",8,2,6,1 January 2010
The Conjuring," The most chilling supernatural thriller in years
","On paper, the premise of The Conjuring reads like a carbon copy of any other supernatural thriller, but to dismiss it as such would be to deprive oneself of experiencing the most chilling horror film in years.Carolyn (Lili Taylor) and Roger Perron (Ron Livingston) have invested all of their savings into purchasing a large farmhouse to raise their five daughters. Almost immediately, the family begins to experience sinister phenomenon that escalates so violently that they make a desperate plea for help to notable paranormal investigators, Lorraine (Vera Farmiga) and Ed (Patrick Wilson) Warren. Accustomed to dealing malevolent spirit activity, even the Warren's are unprepared for the hostile evil that dwells within the Perron's home.The Conjuring is a perfect example of how a stale premise can be transformed by quality filmmaking. Director, James Wan, of Saw and Insidious fame, is a master of the genre. Wan goes back to a much more traditional and grounded style of delivering scares, mercifully avoiding overblown CGI.Another main contributor to the film's success is the intelligent screenplay by Chad and Carey Hayes, whom treat the material with the same respect as one might a great drama. There's not one superfluous scene in The Conjuring as the tension unrelentingly builds throughout.Adding further weight to the project is the stellar cast. Livingston and Taylor have long been amongst the most under-appreciated actors around and are always welcome screen presences thanks to their amazing versatility. Wilson and Farmiga are flawless as the Warren's. Both are the type of performer that elevates whatever project they're in and it's indisputable that the actors make what would have always been a good film great.With a look, tone and quality reminiscent of the all time great horror flicks, The Conjuring is one of the best surprises of the year.http://infilmandtvland.wordpress.com/",9,0,2,28 July 2013
