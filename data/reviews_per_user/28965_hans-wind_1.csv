Skyfall," Enough is Enough
","One morning later I'm still deeply disappointed about the latest Bond adventure Skyfall. I don't want to repeat what other users already wrote. It's not a single scene, the whole movie feels wrong. They just cram too much in, the identity crisis of Bond, that he becomes a drunk, the mother son theme, the aging hero versus the new technology, the hard action scenes and the hopeless attempt to rescue some minutes of the old school Bond. The plot itself is very week. A highly skilled bad man wants to kill M (sometimes). In order to do so he let Bond capture him together with all his resources. Of course he breaks free thanks to the master plan stored in his PC. Both heroes' then start a fight of who can behave more illogical until it comes to a showdown in a place called Skyfall. In the same way as the plot tries to put too much in every single scene does. There is for example one where in Bond's childhood home the housekeeper points to a hideout where Bond spend the time after his parents were killed. Of course you can add something like that, but it needs introduction and follow-up. The movie does nothing of that. The recipe of the movie is clear, mix the Badman franchise with the Bourne franchise. Both of the latter are great, made with determination, paying attention to details and introducing new ideas. Skyfall or the last 2 Bond's in general are just lame copies put together sloppily. One should also talk about thinks that are missing in the movie. There are no beautiful locations; there is no love, no sex, no style, no Bond girl in general. Istanbul the pearl they made a slum and my beloved and stunning Scottish highlands look empty, cold and gray. And so does the whole movie. Bond needs a fresh start. There will always be a place for Bond because he is in so many of our hearts. But first and for all Bond must be Bond.",4,16,33,11 November 2012
