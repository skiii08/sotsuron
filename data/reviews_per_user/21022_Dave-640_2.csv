The Blair Witch Project," A simple, pithy, riveting film.
","A refreshing creation in this era of over-produced, under-written movies.The plot is quite simple, yet this simplicity is what makes the characters' experience SO chilling. You essentially know the outcome (that they were never seen again), so the movie teases your anticipation of their demise. When it arrives, the final realization of what happened is as creepy as their journey to that end.",9,0,0,4 August 1999
Training Day," Good movie, but Washington not believable
","Denzel Washington is a good actor without doubt - I've enjoyed his work ever since St. Elsewhere. But because his characters are always of such stong moral conviction I had a really hard time believing him as a badass. Because he doesn't disappear into the character - as did Al Pacino in Scarface or Morgan Freeman in Street Smart or Harvey Keitel in The Bad Lieutenant - I spent much of the movie trying to believe that Washington was this bad guy, and ultimately couldn't do it. Ethan Hawke was surprisingly good as the rookie, and the plot is good, though the Russian thing seemed underdeveloped and contrived - why exactly did Washington own them the money? I'd recommend the movie, but it won't be remembered as Washington's best work.",Null,1,11,18 March 2002
