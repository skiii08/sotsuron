The King's Speech," Amazing performances and style, but at times felt a bit bored...but still a great film!
","A character driven story seeing 'Bertie' cope with his stammer problem, being thrown into kingship and dealing with the coming of WW2. Colin Firth was brilliant, defiantly deserves an Oscar nomination for his role. There were moments in the film when we really got a deep insight into his character. He was not just a king, but a person with qualities and emotion. Helena Bonham Carter was great as Bertie's wife as she had class and she played the role really well of being Bertie's support system. Geoffrey Rush as Bertie's speech therapist was an interesting character, he was funny and great to watch. All characters was great to watch and had something unique about them. The style of the film was top class as well. If there was one criticism i would say it did feel, at times, quite dreary but i think the characters kept the film up and kept you watching. Plus there is repetition of the 'F' word but only in speech therapy context to loosen Bertie up. All in all, a good watch and i think if you are a historian you'll love it even more. I'm not leaping off my chair but i'm not sitting down criticising the whole film. Good effort.",8,3,7,8 January 2011
Black Swan," Amazing acting, drama, class....with unnecessary sexual content
","First of all i'll start with the positives of this film. Natalie Portman stole the show by miles. Her acting ability to portray a fragile naive ballet dancer in pursuit for the role of a lifetime is captivating and powerful. Her performance was filled with raw emotion and with so much class. Defiently Oscar worthy. I loved how Darren Aronofsky simultaneously told the story of Swan Lake and the story of Ninas drive for perfection. The ending is defiantly the best as it is filled with so much emotion and tension and it keeps you on the edge of your seat. There are scares and thrills throughout the movie which was cool. Aspects of the film were amazing, however, this film as a whole is far from perfect. For the sexual content of this film is very offencive and unnecessary. I understand that the Black Swan is seductive and darker than the pure White Swan but i think the director pushed the boundaries on the sexual nature of this film by miles. The moral message of this film is that in order to be loose and have fun the answer is sex, drugs and alcohol. It's not. This prevents me from saying it was a great film because i can't support a film as a whole where it promotes immorality. But i can say aspects really worked and are to be admired. That's why i have given this film 5 stars, because the drama of the film is amazing but the sexual content was offencive.",3,1,4,26 January 2011
Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," Good story, good characters, good fun!
","This new addition to the popular franchise does not make you say, 'why didn't they stop at number 3?', It made you say, 'So that's why I like the Pirates films!'. Even if you haven't seen the previous 3 or forgotten what happens that will not hinder your enjoyment of the film. I loved the characters, no shallow performances, the plot was substantial and cool and the whole narrative was great. At first the film starts with a few fighting scenes which makes you think, 'Is this what the whole film will be about?!' But it evolves into a great film with a good balance of action and talking bits. Penelope Cruz was the star of the film, feisty, funny, flawed, not sure if she is really bad or not, she brought depth to the film. The film itself had depth and did not bore. The whole film was intricate, meaning it was very interested in the characters and the journey they endured. A great fun film for all to enjoy! Except I hated the involvement of the voodoo doll, no need!",7,1,2,22 May 2011
Walk the Line," Not bad, not bad
","This was a good film because it was interesting to go on the journey of Johnny Cash, his rise and fall and rise again. But for me the film really kicked in about halfway in the film. The first half was good as you saw his early life and the early state of his career but it just felt like we were watching someone live the silly life of a 'rockstar' and it had no substance and i really felt for his wife when he was having affairs with different girls and how he was drinking etc. But after he took the pills and his life went downhill thats when the film had substance as you saw the emotion in the characters and you felt for Johnny wanting his life to get back on track, any developments with the relationship with his father and with June. There was now a reason to watch the film, to see the outcome of this rough patch in his life. Joaquin Phoenix was brilliant, he played the role convincingly. Reese Witherspoon was superb. She had a great singing voice, and she looked the part and was amazing in this (no wonder she won an Oscar). I did like it but on the whole its not what i would call a movie of a lifetime.",7,0,0,14 November 2010
Source Code," An enjoyable, not too hard or easy sci-fi action film with substance!
","'Source Code' deals with interesting issues and themes for which if i reveal them then it could be seen as a spoiler alert, so i guess you'll have to see it for yourself to see if you can highlight them, but what i can say is that with an exceptional cast and a clever plot which is easy to follow, 'Source Code' keeps you watching to see if you can see where the twists and turns will be coming from. Jake Gyllenhaal brings substance to his character and the film and is a great actor in this film. His co-star Michelle who played in 'Eagle Eye' (2008) plays a similar role for which she does really well and both of them together have a great chemistry. There's not much more to say except that it has a great cast, cool and original plot with cool twists and turns coming your way!",8,1,2,2 April 2011
Iron Man 3," I wanted to love it, I really did, but....
","Iron Man 3 has a lot to live up to after the huge success of last years Avengers Assemble, so a lot was expected for this film to take Marvel Phase 2 to a whole new level. Sadly, in my honest opinion and not stating this as a fact, I was not won over by Mr. Stark...To me, Iron Man 3 was going down the right path until it took a complete U turn and plummeted after a huge plot twist. I also felt like Rebecca Hall's character was not satisfyingly fleshed out as her character had a lot of potential to carry parts of the film, sadly this was not the case. Those were two major criticisms of Iron Man 3. I would like to comment on Tony's dealings with the experience of 'The Battle of New York', I completely understand why they chose to stretch out Starks character development by showing a bit of humanity and emotional depth, however, due to the numerous references to Avengers Assemble, sadly the billion dollar summer blockbuster casted a huge shadow over this kick off to Marvel Phase 2...yet again, I understand what they were trying to achieve with focusing on how Stark is coping after 'The Battle of New York' but for some reason, I just couldn't connect with his character within this film. However, I would like to strongly emphasise that I don't hate this film, it's just that it didn't connect with me and sadly I wasn't swept away by Marvel's recent outing. The positives of the film are the characters. Partlow's character definitely stepped up from her previous outings, she definitely played a vital part within this film. I loved the scenes with Stark and a young boy he encounters, it's like he sees a younger self within this boy and learns a lot about himself through this encounter. Great visuals and an amazing 'battle' scene at the end of the film. Overall, a decent outing that sadly did not allow myself to immerse myself with this adventure of a blockbuster.",6,0,1,5 May 2013
Kung Fu Panda," Great characters, great plot, great fun!
","'Kung Fu Panda' delivers what the title promises: Kung Fu action, and a Panda. Po is a big panda who longs to be part of the Furious Five and take part in Kung Fu. He eventually is given the chance to try and accomplish his dreams. The character development in this animation is greatly explored. Po's character development is great and enjoyable, the characters of the Furious Five are given the spotlight for some time. The plot is great and Po is challenged and put up to the test to see if he truly is a Kung Fu Panda warrior. A lot of fun, enjoyment out of the cool action and adventure. DreamWorks has found a premise for some great sequels and more action to come to the big screen.",8,1,1,7 June 2011
Star Trek," One of the best visual features ever!
","As a non-start trek fan i came into this film wondering if i was going to understand what was going on or if it would appeal to non-fans like myself. Luckily you didn't need to have watched every Star Trek movie/TV episode ever made, but it may have helped. Its not a necessity to do this but its just that the plot seemed confusing at times. But i wouldn't complain about it too much because it is easier to understand after a few watches plus you have the spectacular CGI effects to keep you entertained. When i saw this i was blown away by the sheer brilliance of the visual masterpiece before my very own eyes. The whole look of the film had a futuristic, sci-fi and fantasy element to it which i loved. Even the characters were good, they were well cast and enjoyable to watch. Overall a really enjoyable watch for all fantasy/sci-fi lovers.",8,1,3,19 October 2010
Coraline," An unusual, twisted animation for all to enjoy
","'Coraline' is slightly different from, let's say, a Disney animation. However, this is not a criticism for the permission to go a little deeper and darker allows the filmmakers to present the audience with a unique animation with a great adventure. Of course, I would not advise young children to watch this for it is pretty dark for them and some scenes may be a bit too much for them but for older children, teens and adults, they will be able to handle what 'Coraline' has to offer. The titular character goes on a journey to appreciate her family and the real world. A lot of great, amusing characters and a great adventure. It is unusual and twisted but it's still a great watch.",7,3,4,7 June 2011
The Hunger Games," An Imposing Film
","I will firstly say I have not read the book, but what appealed to me was the content of the film. This has exceeded my expectations of how effective and impactful the film is. This film is so engaging, you constantly try and put yourselves in the characters position and try to imagine how they would be feeling and how you would deal with the situation. The pre-game part of the film has a steady pace, nothing riveting but a good enough pace to set up the main characters etc. But as soon as they enter into the arena....It goes up a whole new level. It is so tense, whilst I assume watching it a second time it may not be as tense, you can never stop thinking, 'what would I be like in that situation?' Jennifer Lawrence was brilliant in this film, I knew that this film would be good because she can act. Josh Hutherson wasn't bad, he fitted well into the film. The camera style was very modern, fast paced and had a lot of quick editing. I can't give too much away but I can say it will keep you at the edge of your seat! The murders were very quick, but still effective. It was quite shocking but yet again, you keep thinking to yourself, 'would I kill people?' or 'how would I feel knowing I can be killed any minute?' It is a really engaging film with the right amount of pace and action at the right time. They made it feel real, not manufactured emotions or clichéd moments, but it was very gripping and enjoyable. Don't be sceptical just because of all the hype, it actually has a reason and has the right to receive all the hype: Because it's awesome.",9,2,15,24 March 2012
127 Hours," Dramatic, emotional, disgusting, clever, amazing.....
","Dramatic, emotional, disgusting, clever, amazing. James Franco gave us an Oscar worthy performance as he manages to convey a variety of emotions: comedy, sorrow, anger etc. He carried the film really well. This is like 'I Am Legend' in how an actor is able to carry the film when it's just him and the film...yet it worked. The emotion and James Franco carried the film extremely well. It was not boring and when he did cut his arm off you couldn't help but look, but the look away again. However i didn't approve of the frequent use of the 'F' word plus there were a couple of sexual references which i didn't like and prevented me from marking it 10/10. The filmmaking was clever and the editing brilliant. You had those moments when he was alone in the wide open spaces where it was just quite, and long shots of Aron and it just worked! Plus when it rained and he was stuck in the canon the music and the quick editing was very dramatic and built up the tension, but also when he cut his arm off the music kept building up and the various angle shots and the screams from Aron just made you feel all tense inside...it was brilliant, but other little sequences had impressive camera work. The ending is very uplifting and you couldn't help but leave with a smile on your face. Defiently Oscar worthy (mainly for acting, directing, cinematography etc.) Really good!",8,0,1,11 January 2011
X-Men Origins: Wolverine," The definition of a great action film
","This origin story deliverers a film full of action, cool action sequences and fun characters. Hugh Jackman reprises the role of the tough Wolverine greatly and really brings to life the excitement of the story. Whilst being a great watch, it didn't have the exact amount of sophistication as the previous X-Men films because they felt like they really focused on the feelings of the characters and how they deal with the hatred against their kind. Even though this film does show how Wolverine goes on an amazing journey it relies mainly on the action, which isn't totally a bad thing but the X-Men films didn't have to mainly focus on the action. However, you can't deny that this film is a great addition to the X-Men franchise and deliverers a great adventure.",7,1,4,29 May 2011
Troy," Yet again, another film with the look...but not the quality of acting!
","The only good thing about this film is the CGI effects, and to be honest, even they were not spectacular but they weren't rubbish so i guess i would say the CGI is really good. But the only thing that lets this film down is the hallow Brad Pitt. His character of Achilles is a Greek hero, instead Brad Pitt portrayed him as a cocky, shallow hero in an American accent! Orlando Bloom, Eric Bana, Diane Kruger were good in this film and acted better than Brad Pitt. The film was quite long as well and if a film not good then it seems long. Its like its between Gladiator and Clash of the Titans (but closer to Clash of the Titans that Gladiator) yet again, this is an example of a great concept put into the wrong hands and the focus can be seen to be put on the look and not the quality of the acting of the film.",4,1,2,19 October 2010
X-Men," A great introduction for the superhero genre
","'X-Men' is a great superhero film with great characters, a simple plot and great fun. Wolverine is clearly the leading character yet the film allows us to enjoy the other cool X-Men characters such as Storm, Cyclops, Charles Xavier etc. The plot is simple, not in a bad way but it's great the story doesn't overshadow the characters, vise versa. The actors were really good and had some depth. ALso it's great there was no blaspheming, sexual scenes which is great. This film paved the way for future superhero franchises: Spier-Man, Batman, Fantastic Four etc. It's interesting to see that having powers is something which the government is trying to control.",7,0,1,29 May 2011
The Prestige," Strange, good, mysterious and very imposing.......
","Although initially confusing and mysterious once you think about it (and maybe do some wider research of the plot) then you start to piece together the narrative of the film and you realise what Christopher Nolan wanted to portray with the very imposing last shot. The character development is brilliant as you don't know which side to be on as they are both flawed in their own way. A very complex but clever and unique narrative which is to be appreciated once you fully get it. Great cinematography and art direction, very imposing as your mind still keeps unravelling what you have just seen but you still love it. Amazing performances by Hugh Jackman, Christian Bale, Michael Caine and the rest of the cast. Christopher Nolan is no doubt a very artistic and creative director. Worth the watch",10,0,2,12 October 2010
Cloverfield," Surprisingly brilliant!
","I understand why people may be sceptical of this film as it is shot entirely in hand held camera format. But i think it is this style of filmmaking that made this film special. 'Cloverfield' is full of suspense, action, emotion and cool CGI effects. I think the hand held camera format was very unique to the film as it made the characters more authentic and real. When they cried, or laughed, or ran for their lives you could connect to them as the format made it feel like it was a documentation of a real life event and not fictionalised by the conventional shots used for an action film. It felt like watching a home movie of something that happened so you could connect with the characters. That's what i love about this film. You go on a journey with the characters as they try to save their friend back in the city. I loved the ending as well as it really fitted with the format of the film. You see rubble fall on the surviving characters and the screen to blacked out by the rubble but then the film then cuts to the footage of Rob and Beth's Coney Island date before the disaster saying they are having a great day, this is a great sense of irony. Unfortunely there were few uses of blasphemy and bad language which tainted the film for me. Overall a very different and interesting film.",8,0,2,17 October 2010
The Adventures of Tintin," Good old fashioned fun, in a new form of technology
","An old school action adventure story! Spielberg and Jackson manage to bring this boy hero to life on the big screen with amazing technology and with a great cast! There were some amazing action sequences which were pulled off really well, especially for a motion capture flick! This film has a lot of stand out moments which you would normally expect in a live action adventure film. Also a technical point, the editing was so different and unique. The transition cuts from one shot the the next were genius, they blended in to each other so well and with such style and class. For a person who never heard of Tintin before, I really enjoyed it and recommend it to everyone of any age! This is like the teenage version of Indiana Jones, Great family fun!",9,0,2,15 November 2011
Tangled," Disney hasn't let me down!
","Initial thought of the film was that it would be some cheesy, slapstick, 'the film that will ruin Disney' film but i'm glad to say that i was proved wrong. This film captured the heart of what Disney is all about. There were moments of humour, moments of emotion, adventure and it was just great fun! I thought the makers of the film were clever in creating the character of Rapunzel as the original tale shows lack of profile of Rapunzel. So they had to create her as a feisty, likable heroine with character depth to her. Many Moore was great for her speaking role, she can really sing as well. I thought the character of Mother Gothel was interesting as she was superior, elegant yet she was manipulative and evil. She could really sing as well. Flynn's character was not bad, he came out with a few cheesy lines but overall it was great to see his character development in the film. Also with Rapunzel it was clever how they portrayed her emotion of feeling isolated and cut off from society. She wasn't too depressed or reclusive or realistic but she wasn't too happy clappy and showed some emotion of feeling trapped and wanting to break free from the tower. The songs were great as well, defiantly Disney songs. It was just an amazing animation which was fun and enjoyable to watch. Its for everyone to see, for the whole family. Except i wonder why they didn't stick to traditional sel-animation (handdrawn) like they did with 'Princess and the Frog'....i liked the CGI format though, but i think it would have been more special, more 'Disney' is they stuck to the original format of animation.",9,2,5,11 February 2011
Captain America: The First Avenger," A conventional superhero film-in a good way!
","This film had a steady pace, which is great because you didn't feel that Chris Evan's character was fleshed out too much but at the same time it's not like his character was explored like in an Oscar worthy film. You felt like you were on this journey with Chris Evan's character, Steve Rogers, from a whimpy kid with a dream to an action hero who was saving the world. The action had a great balance, there were a couple of strong action scenes where we see Captain America really showing off his moves. All the characters had their reason to be in the film and really supported Chris Evans hold up the film, and as a leading character he did it really well. You liked the characters you were meant to like and dislike the characters you were not meant to like. Also there was no swearing nor any sex scenes which made the film all the more enjoyable and making it a plain cool superhero flick. A great way to introduce the character and especially since 'The Avengers' (2012) will be coming out next year so we will feel some sort of connection with Captain America. The high rating I have given this film isn't necessarily to do with acting, scriptwriting etc. (not that it is bad because it is good) but I just loved the film because it is a great escape into things you could only wish to do. Marvel delivers a great film once again!",8,1,4,16 August 2011
Oblivion," A beautiful and sophisticated sic-fi blockbuster, with a hint of blandness...
","Referencing to the Tom Cruise canon, Oblivion is a stronger effort than Jack Reacher. Mr. Cruise can still make taking down the bad guys look cool, however this is not his finest hour yet it is far from his worst. Oblivion has an eerie and beautiful feeling in regards to the scenery and visuals. The whole production design was sophisticated and had a crisp feel to it. Overall however, I feel that Oblivion had the potential to be a strong outing for Joseph Kosinski yet the third act did not deliver. The film starts out as a simplistic and imposing, Jack Harper (Cruise) feels a strange connection with planet earth and has doubts about migrating to Titan with Victoria (Riseborough) How the film dealt with Harper's connection with a planet lost from the grasp of hope and life allowed me to engage with the film. Yet, the second half of the film felt like it escalated at a quite rapid pace and the conclusion felt slightly rushed. Oblivion should have stayed with its personal and raw approach rather than levelling it up to a hashed conclusion. The action is not being criticised, but it should have been dealt with a more steady pace. Apart from that, Oblivion is a decent sic-fi which does provide some form of excitement. Focusing on the positives, the soundtrack gave Oblivion a sense of depth and the potential for the film to be epic.Oblivion is far from a disaster, it's just failed to reach for the heights of an epic sic-fi blockbuster.",6,1,4,5 May 2013
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Sheer Genius
","'The Lord of the Rings' trilogy starts off with an amazing, emotional, action packed film. This film has a wholesome feeling about it, you can't help but be affected by this film in a positive way and you can't ignore the effect it has on you. Peter Jackson manages to create a whole different world that the audience can escape into Middle Earth. This film has amazing direction with Philippa Boyens, Fran Walsh and Peter Jackson who manage to bring to life J.R.R Tolkein's epic masterpiece and you can feel that they are passionate about the project and have the utmost respect for the project and that can be evidently seen in this film. 'The Lord of the Rings' has amazing moral standards as there is nothing at all offence with this film which is a breath of fresh air. I love the theme of friendship which is strong on this film, the theme of sacrifice, love and the conflict between good and evil is ongoing. Of course there is the mention of the amazing performances especially by Elijah Wood and Sean Astin, and i could go on listing the rest of the cast saying they were all brilliant. Overall, a definite MUST see, a wholesome film and a great start to the trilogy.",10,2,3,17 October 2010
Kung Fu Panda 2," A fantastic, substantial sequel
","The sequel to the hit 'Kung Fu Panda' (2008) (excuse the pun) really developed into a new level. From the first film we see Po's character develop from a big blob of a panda into a kung fu warrior. We also are introduced to the Furious Five. So the foundation of the characters is laid to allow the sequel to go all out in creating a substantial story. Yet, there is still development in Po's character for we discover his past and find out how indeed his father is a duck (or goose) anyway...I loved that the story was deep and it was still character driven. The relationship of the father and Po is really special and amusing due to the obvious appearance differences. This film is so much fun, for both adults and children, you will not be disappointed. I also loved the fact that the film managed to convey a deep message and yet it did not feel corny or cheesy. The message is about letting go of your troubled past and moving on into your future. There is also a shocking and awesome ending, the ending sequences are awesome. DreamWorks has done it again!",9,1,3,4 June 2011
Knowing," A refreshing film!
","The first time i saw this film, i was blown away! There was great CGI, the acting was really good as well. I think this is Nicholas Cage's best film yet and i really liked Rose Byrne as well, they acted really well and put in a great performance. The whole look, tone of the film was mysterious, dark and interesting. It had a unique feel to the film. There are no rude scenes or foul language which is good to see. The thing i loved about the film is the ending, how it subverted the stereotypical ending of the protagonist surviving the whole film and always stays alive. Well, Nicholas Cage's characters dies by sun rays burning the earth. I know its not a happy ending but i loved how it wasn't predictable and how it wasn't the usual ending, it was different. (Plus his son and Rose's daughter were saved by aliens to live on another planet) I love this film, worth the watch!",8,2,6,23 October 2010
Hugo," An innocent film with a good message
","I was worried walking into this film, mainly because I hoped the film would meet up to the praise that the film has rightly met, but my mind was put at ease during the opening shot and straight away the film captured the beauty of Paris. The whole visual of the city was polished, sophisticated and artistic. The production design has to be praised. The synopsis does not give away what makes this film so magical, and this is a good thing too. But what I am allowed to tell you is that it actually has a good message about how Hugo believes the world is like a big machine and that everyone must have a purpose in it, just like a machine's parts has purpose for the machine it will become (if that makes sense) The film had such an innocence and a comforting feel to it. Asa (Hugo) and Chloe (Isabelle) were quite good, I don't really like them as actors to be honest (I like the boy much better than the girl though) but I wanted to not let that spoil the film for me, and it didn't. Because they actually fitted quite well into the film, they had a good screen chemistry. The whole film is a great homage to cinema as well (but I can't tell you how they do it otherwise it would be a spoiler) watch it for yourself and you'll see what an amazing film this is. Who knew Martin Scorsese could make a clean film without anything offencive in it? ;D",9,4,8,25 February 2012
Enchanted," Walt Disney know how to laugh at themselves with style
","'Enchanted' is an amazing family film for all to enjoy. The thing that makes this film work is that is is a sort of spoof of conventional Disney films: the distressed princess, the evil stepmother, the airhead prince and the many references to many of Walt Disney's greatest works. The film starts in the animated world where we meet Giselle and due to a certain chain of events she finds herself falling down a well ending up in the real world of New York (had to be America) She learns more about the real world while Prince Edward is coming to her rescue. 'Enchnated' provides fresh, original, classic feel songs such as 'How does she know', 'So Close' and 'Happy Working Song' for which all can enjoy and sing to. Even though this film is a sort of spoof it is not a cynical spoof (for it is Disney taking the mick out of themselves) and thats what makes it work and light hearted. Full of innocence and joy, this is a film not to be missed.",9,2,2,7 June 2011
Gone with the Wind," Perfect!
","This film is a true classic, all ages and all generations will love this cinematic masterpiece. Vivien Leigh really brought this film to life, portraying the complex character of Scarlett. You cannot define her character in one word. Her character can cause a lot of debate: Is she good or just plain selfish and cruel. Well, she's a bit of both but I would argue that at the end of the day she is a good person, who only knows a certain way of life which isn't exactly the right way but you see her growth in maturity and character throughout the film. There are moments when you realise that she has determination and strength to rise above situations and she really surprises you, in a good way, in certain ways which makes you grow respect for her character. You can't help but like her or be interested by her no matter what you think of her. Also, it would be wrong to not mention Clark Gables brilliant performance as Rhett Butler. He was so different from the 'gentlemen' that in those days was of the norm, but the chemistry between Scarlett and Rhett was perfect, totally convincing and brilliant to watch. But the whole casting was spot on, every character was interesting and likable and all gave everything into their characters. Even in the 21st Centuray it is still considered a masterpiece and watching it, you don't feel such a huge gap in years. You can still watch it today and thoroughly enjoy it. You have to watch this film, it's a must see!",10,1,1,27 July 2011
Batman Begins," Batman Revamped!
","I love this film. Christopher Nolan has taken Batman and revamped the franchise. There is a darkness to the film which is mysterious and interesting which i love about this film. It's all about the origins of Batman which is a risky move as there have been other superhero films about their origins (especially 'The Hulk' (2003)) where it has been a very boring watch but with 'Batman Begins' Christopher Nolan makes the character of Brace Wayne interesting and complex so we understand why he became Batman (by using flashbacks of his past etc.) so whilst waiting for Batman to save the day we have to follow Bruce on his journey towards that hero status which is a very interesting journey and not boring in the slightest. Its a very enjoyable film as well because it has the action,the twist in the plot, the interesting characters, it has everything. A great way to re-introduce the franchise. Worth the watch.",9,0,0,20 October 2010
Wreck-It Ralph," An arcade version of 'Toy Story' (1995)
","Disney are amazing. Over the past 80 or so years they have brought us endless classics and memorable characters and stories. But when they break away from their traditional fairy tales or from their traditional cel-animation (eg. 'Meet the Robinsons' (2007) and 'Bold' (2008)) they aren't as beloved as a Pixar CGI animation is. In my opinion 'Wreck-It Ralph' follows the patters of the two films mentioned above, so I was hoping that Disney could make a really enjoyable CGI animation solo. Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed 'Meet The Robinsons' and 'Bolt' but they didn't live up to the likes of 'Aladdin' (1992, 'The Little Mermaid' (1989), 'Tarzan' (1999) etc. However, with 'Wreck-It Ralph' they have produced one of their best solo CGI animation to date. This film reminded me of an arcade version of 'Toy Story' (1995) which is a compliment. It was sheer genius how they translated an arcade gaming world into a film world, and how the arcade gaming characters would occupy themselves after playing hours. Also how the depicted the good and bad characters was really interesting and enjoyable to watch. Disney allows us to feel sympathy for the villain which is interesting, because as it is mentioned in the film, the 'bad guy' is just a label, it doesn't make them bad people. It's hard to explain without giving any spoilers, but I can say the message of the film is really ironic and clever how they used a traditional message and altered it in a unique way. The story is decent enough. Bad guy wanting to break out of the mould and be the hero and win a medal for once. But his encounter with Vanellope von Schweetz is really special. Her character is so adorable and is very easy to relate to. It kept you watching because it is a unique film so you didn't know entirely where the film was heading, and it came with many thrills and surprises. Despite it's interesting and enjoyable characters, I wish they did feature more of Sonic and characters from his universe. I didn't know the majority of the gaming characters so I was really excited when seeing Sonic on the posters, so was a little saddened at the 1% you see of him within the film, but it didn't hinder the enjoyment of the film. Also, despite the story being really unique and enjoyable, I wish they included more arcade gaming worlds. This is just a minuscule criticism. Overall, an enjoyable family film with a fresh story and fun characters.",7,3,4,16 December 2012
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," A potential for an amazing trilogy
","Finally Peter Jackson graces us with the prequel to the best film trilogy (The Lord of the Rings) with 'The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey'. Obviously people are going to draw comparisons to the two, however, we have yet to see the completion of The Hobbit Trilogy so it's hard to make a strong comparison just yet. But we can see that there is a different tone for The Hobbit, a lighter tone with humour sprinkled on the film which is done in a tasteful way. First of all, praise has to go out to Martin Freeman for an amazing portrayal of Bilbo Baggins. He looks the part and plays a certain naivety and innocence and we get to see his character development throughout the film, and there is enough room for his character to develop throughout the trilogy. As a LOTR fan it was a treat to see Gandalf, Elrond, Galadriel, Saruman and Frodo within this new Middle Earth adventure. The Hobbit is full of great adventure and epic scenes. Favourite scene is the riddle scene between Bilbo and Gollum, it was so simple and engaging, to see two contrasting characters interact the way they do. The dwarfs are a great bunch, and praise for how their songs were included within the film. Initial comparisons of the two (LOTR and Hobbit) are that The Hobbit has a lighter tone, which is enjoyable. Yet I loved the more serious and epic tone to LOTR. The Hobbit has room to progress as we see stronger character developments and the adventure is assumed to get more dramatic and epic. This is not a criticism, as the first film is an introduction of what is to come, and what a great job Mr. Jackson has done. I just know that there are more exciting things to come, given from what I have seen from this amazing kick off to a new and potentially epic trilogy.",9,11,24,13 December 2012
Rise of the Planet of the Apes," A thought provoking blockbuster!
","This film really makes you think, not in the whole animal hugging type way, but in a way of following the main characters. Ceaser, the ape who starts the whole riot, shows that actions speak louder than words. For the audience have to watch Ceaser and try and 'read his mind', so to speak. The whole development of the rise is very well done, not to fast and not to slow in pace. The human characters are also a joy to watch, James Franco and Freida Pinto are really good in this film. Tome Felton? meh (good thing he's not the main character) the rest worked really well in the film. Don't expect the whole world to be overtaken by apes in this one film but expect to see the beginning of the growth of the apes domination over the whole world. It's only the beginning, i'd be surprised to see if there were to be no Ape sequels.",8,2,5,15 November 2011
X-Men: The Last Stand," It's now or never
","I love these types of films, where everything in the previous films have built up to this moment. 'X-Men: The Last Stand' is one of those films. This film doesn't go further in the investigation of Logans (Wolverine) past because instead it focuses on the bigger picture: the conflict between mankind and mutants. There has been a cure discovered and which causes the Brotherhood to react by wanting to destroy the cure and the source of the cure, but will the X-Men allow this to happen? Also the character focus shifts on Jean Grey who lets out her more 'wild' side which is so cool. Many plot twists are seen in this film which are so cool. While the Bortherhood react quite badly to the cure the X-Men, whilst not happy with there being a cure since mutation is not a disease, try and stop the destruction the baddies intend to cause. There is a fresh feel to this film and I think it's been due to the fact there was a new director directing this film, Brett Ratner. I think it may be the best out of the franchise so far, not sure, but it's great anyway.",7,2,2,29 May 2011
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Another epic masterpiece!
","Peter Jackson comes back with such a fantastic and epic masterpiece. The thing i love about the second instalment is that it has a slightly darker tone to it which is very captivating. We go from 'The fellowship of the ring' where we see Frodo as an innocent hobbit and all is well with the world but now we progress into the tale we see the effect the ring has on everyone,things start to deteriorate such as Frodo and Sams relationship, especially with the involvement of the sneaky and deceptive Gollum (and of course because of the ring) which is interesting to observe. The narrative is more complex as the fellowship has split so we follow Frodo and Sam, Aragon and the gang and Merry and Pippin which is interesting as they all have a connection yet they are not together. You see as the film progress Yet again peter Jackson and the writing team make another success with this film and yet again there is nothing offensive with this film which is what most films could do with. Amazing acting from the whole cast. I love the ending as it is a chilling ending giving the audience a little something but giving us the rest in the third film. Another epic masterpiece form the amazing Peter Jackson.",10,0,2,17 October 2010
Cars 2," Not as good as the first, but still an enjoyable PIXAR animation
","First to say that it was not as good as the first film but that aside you will still enjoy this film, it's PIXAR, no matter what they do it will still have some substance. Starting off with the positives, I loved the whole cultural and spy genre addition to the film. The film focuses on Mater and it's more of a self discovery of his character than about Lightning McQueen which was quite cool. They travel a lot in this film and you see Japan, Italy and England which was really good, and it felt so real because of the brilliant animation. The new characters voiced by Michael Caine and Emily Mortimer as spies were a great addition to the film. However, I hate to criticise a PIXAR film but for a sequel it felt a bit relaxed, in a way of thinking 'Cars was great, we don't really need to develop anymore' until the whole spy plot kicks in but it should have thrown itself into the new plot instead of lingering from what made the first one great. Just like how 'Toy Story 2' felt like a great sequel. But you will still enjoy this film for the great action and how cannot you not resist a PIXAR animation, they know how to make an animation.",6,0,1,23 July 2011
Unknown," It could have been more concise
","If you're expecting 'Taken 2' then you may be disappointed. But even if we're not comparing it to 'Taken' and judging it by its own right, i didn't feel that it had enough action in then what the trailer promised. I thought the plot was something different, unique and unpredictable. I had no idea what was going to happen which was really good as it kept you guessing and wondering how it will all work out. It had its moments of action and suspense, where you really paid attention and found it exciting, but i felt that there were many long, still moments which could have been shortened and the film could have been more concise. The characters were OK, nothing deep or Oscar worthy but good enough to keep you watching. Also, strangely enough, i felt that Liam Neeson didn't act to the best of his abilities, at times it was all shouting and no emotion, but it's Liam Neeson so you can't criticise him. Plus, they always say that an actor is as only as good as his script. A little more action, tension, on the run moments would have been nice to match the level of greatness of 'Taken' (2008)",6,1,3,12 March 2011
Million Dollar Baby," A contradictory film
","I expected to see an iconic film, an Oscar winning, perfect film. I was half wrong. I'll start with the positive aspects of this film. Hilary Swank was amazing, she defiantly deserved her Oscar as she played a strong, bold, fierce and determined female boxer fighting for her place in the boxing ring despite her gender. The film started of well and gradually grew more interesting as we saw the progression of Hilarys character coming from a hillbilly wanting to win her place in the boxing ring. That was the positive aspect of this film. However, there were aspects of the film which prevented this film from reaching perfection. Clint Eastwood disappointed me a little, his foul mouth was was offencive first of all. But what spooled it for me was the silly ending. Maggie (Hilary Swank) takes to a serious injury during her last fight breaking her spine or collar bone or something like that and she is now paralysed. After a few months she asks Frankie (Clint Eastwood) her trainer, to perform euthanasia so she can be at peace. He initially says no but later on he goes in the middle if the night and fulfils her wish and she dies. The end (with some depressing music) So basically Frankie murdered Maggie and in the film it glorifies euthanasia. Also the last part of the film contradicts what the whole film was about: determination and fighting for your place in the world. So what does she do: gives up. She doesn't practise what she preaches. This really frustrates me and makes me hate this film. So its hard for me to love it completely. I love it for its great acting and emotion, but hated it for its contradictory nature and glorifying a very controversial matter. Thats why i've given it 5 stars, half love it and half hate it.",5,0,3,27 November 2010
Clash of the Titans," Great action and effects......terrible and cringe worthy acting!
","The whole look of the film is really good, the amazing CGI and the action was all there. But what was lacking was the believable and emotive characters who we had to watch for an hour and a half. Sam Worthington played this bitter, hard hearted demi God but Sam did not portray his character well, he seemed more like a rebellious and grumpy kid more than a genuine broken man. If this film was in the hands of someone like Peter Jackson this film could have been the next 'Lord of the Rings' as he would have had taken the time to understand the characters and create a strong plot narrative. But instead some lousy director came along and said forget about the quality of the acting, lets go all out with the CGI effects. Also the silly things is that the accents varied when its meant to be set in Greece: Sam spoke in an Australian accent, Liam Neeson in British and i'm sure there were some USA accents in there which was a stupid mistake to make. But, despite the cringe worthy aspect of the whole film i have to applaud the fact it had no rude or offencive scenes plus there is not foul language of any sort so i guess the fact it was a clean film helped gain 5 stars instead of 4. A great concept which was totally messes up. I wonder what they are going to do with the second one....",5,1,1,18 October 2010
The Dark Knight," A slick, cool blockbuster by the sophisticated Christopher Nolan!
","'The Dark Knight' has perfect cinematography. It is a clean cut film, with amazing camera angles, great art direction, everything looks so sophisticated. Thats what i like about this film, its not just a great blockbuster, but its a great blockbuster with substance. Christian Bale steps into the role of Batman for the second time and he does not disappoint. He is a great actor and really portrays the characters of Bruce Wayne/Batman really well. The newcomer Maggie Gyllenhaul is not bad, you can stand her but i'm sure there is someone better to play Rachel Dawes. The rest of the cast were well selected and really played their characters well. It would be a crime not to mention Heath Ledgers amazing performance as the Joker, he embodies the role of the psychotic and mysterious villain and he really convinces the audience that he is this characters which is a great acting skill. He steals the show in this film. The ending is a great opening to allow a third movie to come along. Christopher Nolan shows through his filmmaking that he has put a lot of effort into this project by the sheer genius of the film. A definite blockbuster and worth the watch!",10,1,3,20 October 2010
Alice in Wonderland," Tim Burton does it again!
","Tim Burton really knows how to deliver a very unique story with a dark tone which make it all the more interesting and realistic. I loved the tone of them film as it added drama and suspense to the film. The CGI effects were really good and the whole film was visually appealing. Tim Burton really captured the concept of Wonderland and allowed us to be transported into that world to escape from reality. The characters were really good: Johnny Depp as the Mad Hatter (he really engaged into being a fickle character and you really liked his character) Helen as the Red Queen (Bold, sharp, evil, a very good portrayal of the Red Queen) Anne Hathaway as the White Queen (initially hard to relate to, as the film progresses her character becomes more appealing) and Alice (not the strongest character but still a character worth taking notice of) and all the rest of the characters were enjoyable to watch. However i wish they focused a bit more on the world of Wonderland. It is a place of strangeness, fantasy and imagination yet the film focused little on that aspect and instead on how Alice is finding it hard to remember when she was least there. Of course its great Tim Burton paid attention to character and plot but maybe with the added value of exploring the surroundings and taking in the imagination and fantasy of it all would have made the experience much better. But all in all a very enjoyable watch with action, substantial characters and great effects! (plus its a clean movie which is great)",6,2,4,19 October 2010
Avatar," A visual epic masterpiece
","The thing i love and respect about this movie is the amount of effort and hard work James Cameron put inti this project, it is evident in the whole film. You can tell it took him around 10 years to create Pandora, he has attention to detail as the nature of the planet can be seen to be created with such detail and with a realistic touch. I respect James Cameron for fully committing himself to make a believable fantasy world full of attention to detail. The cinematography is breathtaking, amazing visual, CGI effects, a visual treat for the eyes. Some people may say that the storyline and acting let the film down. But in my opinion i don't fully take this film. I agree that it's not the most original idea for the film but i don't see it as weak. I think it is the foundation of the amazing journey Jake Sully and Neytiri take and the emotion was evident. Zoe Salanda stole the show as even though she was shielded by the blue CGI skin her emotion and amazing performance shone through and you could real feel that raw emotion from her. I love this film, i think it's great and worth the watch.",9,1,4,17 October 2010
The Artist," Actions speak louder than words
","I love this film. It's just as simple as that. But I'll explain why I found it to be so enchanting and perfect. I loved how they handled the subject of the rise of the talkies, despite the fact this film is a silent film....If I told you how that would be a spoiler for you. Jean Dujardin (George Valentin) and Berenice Bejo (Peppy Miller)had an amazing chemistry on screen. They really stole the show. But what has to be credited and ofter overlooked is that the fact they only are allowed to capture the audiences attention for about an hour and forty minutes with expression and movements only, no dialogue. That is impressive and not once did I find myself falling asleep, because the enthusiasm of Jean and the sweetness and jolly manner of Berenice was so enjoyable to watch and you know what the say, actions speak louder than words. Of course the dog, Uggie, was beyond brilliant. The music of course was also the star of the film, the music alongside the actions of the actors is vital in terms of trying to convey certain emotions across to the audience. It was so beautiful and perfect for what was taking place within the film. Don't let the fact it is a silent film put you off, because it is so much fun and it is so lively that you can't stop smiling throughout the whole film. The film meets up to the critical acclaim this masterpiece has received, it does not disappoint.",10,6,11,26 February 2012
Super 8," A Super Film!
","I think 'Super 8' deserves the praise that it has been given for this film was refreshing from many films out there now. However, i'm not one of those cynical people who say 'finally, a good movie amongst sequels, reboots and comic book movies' because I love all of those but I do agree that it is still refreshing and has more focus on character than many films. 'Super 8' owes it's praise to the casting, especially of the children who have an amazing chemistry and keep you amused all the way through...even in the actiony moments. Joe Lamb (Joel Courtney) was like the leading man of the group, he was the most normal, likable and has the most substance in back story. But then there is the goofy and humorous Cary (Ryan Lee) who always carries fireworks. Also there is the wuss of the pack Martin (Gabriel Basso), the bossy director Charles (Riley Griffis) and the list goes on. Point is, each character is unique and individual yet they manage to dwell really well together, allowing to conjure up many laughs even in the intense moments. That's what made this film special, because it was from the point of view of kids instead of from the military or grown ups and in the scary moments you could laugh because of the humour of the children. This was a good film, but maybe the ending was a bit weak. Not bad but a bit weak compared to the amazing suspense and steady pace of the film. It doesn't spoil the film though. Stay for the credits because they show the short film the kids are trying to make in the film and it is really funny. The language is an issue, as a Christian the blaspheming (about 5 times) was offencive and inappropriate especially coming mainly from Charles. But there were no sexual scenes which was good. Overall, a really good film with great characters and a great story. Enjoy!",7,0,1,20 August 2011
Up," Up
","PIXAR has done it again! A wonderful, clean, family fun film for all ages to see. PIXAR have gone down the more emotional route which is interesting as it will widen the target audience as it is slightly more mature but it really helps with our understanding the character of grumpy Carl. We understand what he has been through and truly empathise with him. There is great character development and PIXAR have managed to create substantial, likable and funny characters. Such as Russel the cute, chubby, quirky kid who tags along with Carl for the adventure of a lifetime. There is Kevin the bird who simply steals the show, Kevin is really funny and very likable (Kevin is so cool) Doug the dog is genius, PIXAR managed to capture the characteristics of a dog in his voice and Carl goes on a character journey along with the audience. It rightly won an Oscar a sit is truly a wonderful animation to be loved by all.",9,1,1,17 October 2010
Rio," A fun, exotic animation to be enjoyed by all!
","'Rio' left me with a smile on my face when the end credits came up, the film was filled with fun songs, great characters and a good story. Blu is a likable character because he's a recluse who has his best friend Linda to look after him. But then he's thrown into an open, exotic and different lifestyle which is where Jewel comes in as this feisty bird wanting to be free. The songs were OK, no Disney songs, but they were catchy and not bad for a non-Disney production. Nico and Pedro (Jamie Foxx, Will.I.Am) were upbeat and fun characters as well as the leading couple with the voices of Anne Hathaway and Jessie Eisenberg who were great together. The little baby blue macaws were cute with their huge heads and tiny bodies. OK, so it may be no PIXAR animation but it has enough fun, cool songs and cool characters to keep you watching.",7,2,3,16 April 2011
How to Train Your Dragon," At first it seems shallow and boring, but after the second watch you see the heart within the story
","When i first saw this film at the cinema i thought it had no heart and was quite shallow. The thing that annoyed me was that this son of the chief spoke in an American accent when everyone else (apart from some teens) spoke in a Scottish accent, they all should have had one type of accent. But after watching it a second time i saw the heart of the story and the emotion between Toothless and Hiccup. It is very uplifting and so enjoyable to watch. I live Toothless, he's just plain cool and cute, i want a dragon like that one!!! But i think the journey Hiccup takes is extraordinary and its great to see how he grows in confidence but still remains the down to earth kid that we see at the beginning and he doesn't loose that quality through the film. It had humorous moments in with some of the characters which kept the spirit up in this film. The ending is very uplifting and i wonder how they are going to follow on with a sequel which is planned to be released in 2013. The CGI is amazing, it's so polished and modern and it feels fresh. I do think that if you don't like this film at first, at least watch it again and you'll love it soon enough, i'm sure of it. DreamWorks have hit a goldmine with this one.",8,4,8,2 January 2011
Thor," A good old fun Super-hero flick!
","There was something different about 'Thor'. Whilst not being the best super-hero film in the world, it was a great one and the best one since 'The Dark Knight'. However it was the first one in a while where it was a full on fantasy super-hero film where there are no possibilities and their powers are shown in a great way. There was a great balance of how much the Asgardian world was shown and how Earth was shown. Chris Hemsworth played the arrogant turned humble god Thor, however i think the star of the film was Tom Middleston for his acting had more depth expected from a super-hero film. Natalie Portman was OK, nothing amazing but nothing awful. Overall a good cast to bring to life a great film. Also the amazing thing worth noting is that there is no sexual scenes or strong language! See, you can have no swear words or rude scenes and you can still enjoy a great film!",8,4,9,28 April 2011
Stranger Than Fiction," Indescribable
","'Stranger than fiction' had a very calm tone to it, the film had a very mundane feel to it and it was simple....yet effective. Theoretically this film should have been boring, but it was not. All you need are 2 main characters, 2 other important characters and a couple non-important characters to drive this film....not an assemble of A-Lister's, just a few main characters and the film is great. Will Ferrell as Harold Crick was brilliant, this comedic actor managed to play a serious role, and managed to play it in a great way. He played the role with emotion and really understood the character he was playing. Emma Thompason was brilliant, such a great actress (apart from when she blasphemed) she played the role of a washed up author really well. These two actors stood out for me. Dustin Hoddman, Maggie Gyllenhaal were good as well (apart from when Hoffman used the F word once) so the acting was really good. The whole film had a very simple look, even the look of Harolds apartment, his job, his personality, the colouring of the film was very basic....but thats all the film needed as we could understand the character of Harold and build upon it through character development. The interesting connection of Emma and Will Ferrel is very interesting and as you watch the film you will discover how this is. It's hard to mark this film as it's not a blockbuster but it's not an average simple film...i guess you could say it's indescribable.",8,0,0,25 October 2010
Inception," Mind blowing blockbuster entertainment!
","This seriously is one of those films where you are TRULY entertained! You can't put it in a limited amount of words, its just amazing!!! i loved how the idea was original and so cleverly portrayed and played out in this amazing film. The acting was brilliant: Leonardo was great in here and really got into character, Ellen was brilliant and stood out in this film, Cillian Murphy, Joseph etc. they were all good in this film! This film played with your mind but not in a way you are lost in the plot but in a way which makes you think from all angles of the plot. Its easy to catch the gist of it and then you just let the effects fill up the little bits you are confused about. It was made with sophistication which is what i like about Christopher Nolan. I loved how you felt involved in the film and with the characters even though you physically weren't in the film. There were scenes which made your jaw drop, they were that epic! This is beyond brilliant, a definite must see!!! BUT....beware the few uses of blasphemy which was the only disappointment in the film. Christopher Nolan uses his very creative and intelligent filmmaking mind as he did with 'The Prestige'. I am proud to be British by looking at Christopher Nolans films, he has done an amazing job on 'Inception'.",10,0,4,17 October 2010
The Blind Side," A very touching and emotional film
",The standout of the film was defiantly Sandra Bullock and she rightly so deserved an Oscar award. I think that she really became her character and its amazing to see a comedic actress playing such an intense role and i think thats why her performance was so highly praised. The film itself is a very wholesome and clean film. There is nothing offencive in this film which is also why i highly rated this film. The characters were substantial: like Michael (Big Mike)who played a young broken man being mended by Sandra Bullocks family (especially her son S.J) I think this film really shows the good there is in the world and especially because Bullocks character was a Christian so it shows Christians in a positive light which is a great bonus. You really connected and cared for the characters which is what i loved about the film and it kept you engaged in what was taking place. Worth the watch and enjoy!,9,0,5,19 October 2010
Prometheus," Unique, fresh, enjoyable
","Prometheus is a fresh, different and unique film. Yes it is argued a prequel to Alien, but in today's landscape of film it really does stand out. It had the right balance of scares, shocks and time for the plot to develop and to be engaged with the characters. At the end of the day it is a really good sci-fi/action film where, because it is different, you were unsure where events of the film would lead to and you were unsure of the fate of some characters. Ridley Scott managed to draw you into this world (it even works in 2D) and you don't question the credibility of anything until the end when you remember, it is just a film. The whole cast were brilliant: Noomi Rapace lead the film amazingly, Charlize Theron managed to pull off this cold and heartless character and so on, but Michael Fassbender was one of the standouts of this film. Playing robot David, he portrayed his character as a cold, mysterious and interesting character who has a big part to play in the film. It felt like Ridley Scott gave us about 90% (in a good way) because he doesn't want to give too much away. It felt like that he wanted us to feel like we wanted to see more, equalling a possibility of a sequel. Prometheus manages to be an engaging, interesting, enjoyable, unique and clever sci-fi film which at the end makes you want to see more of this world Scott has created.",9,5,14,2 June 2012
Despicable Me," Good...(not brilliant)...but very good :D
","I love the concept of this film, how the viewpoint is of the villain and that conflict and battle of the egos' for the best villain title. But i think the film really kicked in when we are introduced to the cutest little orphan girls: Margo, Edith and Agnes (Agnes being the youngest and cutest) I loved the character development of Gru, who turns from failed villain to loving father and big softie. But sadly this film kept being interrupted by silly characters such as Vector (who just simply wasn't funny) and Dr. Nefario who was just a British idiot. But then when we are brought back to Gru's storyline which simply make the film what it is. So it did feel inconsistent, the storyline of Gru and the little kids is the best and i guess you can cope with the in between bits. Of course it's not as good as a PIXAR animation: because it didn't have that emotional depth as PIXAR does (it was emotional and sweet but thats it, nothing more) and a PIXAR film feels right and feels so nurtured by a group of enthusiastic artists and animators but this felt like just a good film. But putting that aside this is no doubt an enjoyable film, of course the little minions were cute, and there was some great character development in this film so i would say it's a good watch.",7,7,12,16 October 2010
X-Men: First Class," Not revolutionary to the superhero genre, but still a pretty amazing film!
","'X-Men: First Class' manages to not only include some pretty awesome mutants but Matthew managed to make the main focus of the film about the story, and yet still let the film be about the origins of X-Men. At first I thought, OK, enough about the 1960's and more about the mutants but eventually I came to love how the focus was on the conflict of Russia and America and how easily the mutants fitted into it. The characters were greatly explored, especially Magneto because you understand why he is who he is and that really he is not really evil but just full of anger and grief. Xavier was pretty cool and you see how he ends up in a wheelchair. Also Mystique was a great character was was explored really well. A great movie for all to see!",8,3,11,1 June 2011
The Dark Knight Rises," Everything came together
","Now I think that this film was different to what I expected. I expected more of an action story plot like in 'The Dark Knight' (2008) however, it felt like Nolan took the approach where he wanted to show how everything from the previous two films gave off something, for this film to deal with and for it to bubble up and explode. It's hard to explain but the main thing that I loved about this film was it's message of rising up against everything that is against you (could have easily used a title of a song to explain my point, but I resisted to urge to sound cheesy) Bruce Wayne has been in exile for 8 years and now has to 'rise', but it's how he does which is brilliant. He slowly gets back into the game but I loved how he found his purpose to become Batman again, not just the typical one of becoming a symbol for the people, but more of a personal reason. The fight scenes between Bane and Batman were breathtaking, it was amazing to see Batman find his physical match.It's wrong though to dismiss the involvement of Hathaways's amazing take on Catwoman. Slick, ambiguous and 'adaptable' she was just so cool! The chemistry between Hathaway and Bale was great as well. The great thing about watching this film is that there are so many surprises that were thankfully hidden from the heavy promotion of this film, It was just genius. Let's just say it all came full circle. The cinematography was beautiful, cinematically breathtaking and the production design was to fall in love with. Hardy was just exceptional as Bane, menacing and brutal he was a great choice for the villain of this film. I think it was clever how Nolan decided to choose a different type of villain from the Joker, it makes both of their performances distinct and you don't have to compare their performances. They are both amazing in their own right.Hanz Zimmer does not disappoint, his eerie yet inspirational feel to his music is a perfect marriage with what is happening on the screen.I think it will take a while to sink in, because like I said it was different to what I expected, but Nolan is a genius in concluding this masterpiece of a trilogy.",10,2,7,21 July 2012
X2: X-Men United," It just gets better
",Continuing from the first X-Men film the story develops into a great fun action film. It's great because there are more complications within the characters and story which makes it more interesting. The character of WOlverine becomes more intriguing for he tries to uncover his mysterious past. I loved the involvement of Mr. Stryker and how the action centres around him and what he plans to do. The characters are once again great and really bring the story to life. Bryan Singer did a great job with this film and for all people who love superhero films then this is the film for you. There was one scene of sexual content which was unnecessary. Apart from that this is a fun filled adventure film.,7,0,1,29 May 2011
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," An Epic Masterpiece
","This movie represents the result of a hard working and amazing director Peter Jackson as well as amazing and emotive performances and the whole look is beyond epic. I love this film for its moral values, there is nothing offensive in this movie which is refreshing and rare. An amazing conclusion to the best trilogy ever. Expect amazing battle sequences, great acting, great CGI, amazing moral values and messages, just a perfect film. This is more than a movie, it is an experience and rightly deserved the 11 Oscars it proudly won. Peter Jackson really understands what the whole concept of Lord of the Rings is about, he managed to capture the purity of Frodo and Sams friendship, the epic nature of the big scale action sequences, and i respect the script writing team (philipa, Fran, Peter) for creating the emotion which is filled in the film. This is a brilliant film which will last for generations :D",10,0,1,10 October 2010
Donnie Darko," Strange and interesting....but that wasn't enough!
","This cult classic did not have such an impact on myself as clearly it has on the cult following. Whilst being dark, mysterious and interesting with the tone of the film...there was quite a lot wrong with the film. There was quite a frequent use of strong language which was unnecessary and the sexual references was not pleasant at all and i found that really off putting. Those aspects of the film put me off and prevented me to enjoy the film. Also the character of Frank was quite disturbing. The few positives that can be said about the film is that Jake Gyllenhaal was quite impressive in this film as he manages to give the performance of a very troubled teenager. The ending is imposing though, very emotional and interesting. It is also very confusing as it is open to many interpretations. Overall, not worth the watch as even though there were inklings of promise the immoral aspect of the film really put me off.",3,4,8,17 October 2010
Transformers: Dark of the Moon," So much better than the second one, maybe the best out of the trilogy!
","I was expecting another terrible Transformers film due to the negative reviews and bad word of mouth however I was pleasantly surprised. The thing that made this film work was that it actually had a plot and the fighting had some reason, unlike the second one. I loved the whole involvement of the moon and space adventure. Some of the action sequences were immense, the stunts were amazing, out of this world. The action was really fun and kept you watching right till the end. Don't expect Oscar worthy acting or scriptwriting but since when does an action film have real substance in acting, not a bad thing but just fact. The new girl was OK, however by her character there were some moments where women were painted in a negative light. Also there were some glitches in the language which was not appropriate and also the couple of sexual references were inappropriate, not explicit but heavily implicated. This tainted the quality of the film and was unnecessary however the overall conclusion is that 'Transformers: Dark of the Moon' is a great fun action adventure with killer moves and a decent plot.",7,0,2,19 July 2011
The Social Network," Great visual style and acting.....but why make it so dirty and immoral!
","First off i want to say that the look of this film was very sophisticated, it was very stylised in looking fresh and stunning. Also Jesse Eisenberg was beyond amazing as Mark Zukerberg. He really played the role of a person with a lack of social skills with intelligence very well and he stole the show, without him this film would not have worked. Justin Timerlake was really good as well, his character i am not a fan of but still, he acted really well in this film. The rest of the acting was good as well. Andrew Garfield acted OK in this film, not to be praised as much as Jesse but still a good performance. But why did he have to be the one who blasphemed throughout the whole movie! I think i have stated the positives of the film, but what really ruined it for me was the immorality found on this film. There were lots of party scenes where lesbian kissing took place, provocative dancing, drinking of alcohol, explicit use of drugs, swearing, some rude scenes. This really tainted the film and you could have done without it. It should have had a 15 rating, it's a 12A so even a 8 year old could watch all that filth...that is a disturbing thought. A thing to note is that it felt that the film had no narrative structure, this is not necessarily a criticism but it felt that it was hard to see where the film was going to end up. Yes there were flashbacks and it was a bout a court case, but it felt the film was all on one level. It felt like going on a journey with the characters which was interesting. the film had great style and acting but it was tainted by the filth in this film.",6,1,3,28 October 2010
