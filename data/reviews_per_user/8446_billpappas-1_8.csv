Changeling," Doesn't 'changeling' have something to do with a loaded diaper?
","How did someone who started out making spaghetti westerns get so self-important and full of himself as Clint Eastwood? I haven't seen the entire movie, beginning to end, just sections of it on TV and I just can't force myself to go all the way with it. It had the 'one eye on the Oscars' syndrome feel to it.I think Eastwood has seen too many Spielberg movies and went for the expensive production values rather than memorable characters. Both are experts at creating 2 dimensional characters that I couldn't care less about.First. I love Angelina Jolie but in this dreck, I cringed every time she was on the screen. I didn't empathize with her character's situation at all, which is pretty hard for a movie to fail at so totally given the naturally compelling 'situation'.Second. The story seemed so hopelessly depressing that I couldn't bring myself to care one way or another about her, the kid, the Depression or whatever.Third and most obvious was Eastwood's deliberate and overdone attempt to authentically recreate the era with clothes, cars, streetcars, and all kinds of stuff that seemed to take center stage over anything else. Surprisingly, there were still a lot of anachronisms with things in the movie that weren't created or used till years later. Fail.Sometimes, it's better for a director to create the illusion of an era in the imagination of the audience rather than excruciating close up shots of details to 'force' the notion. Heck, Michael Keaton's spoof, Johnny Dangerously, recreated the era better even while taking great artistic liberties. I'm reminded of how audiences who saw Gone With The Wind thought they saw great Civil War battle scenes in the movie when there wasn't one single shot of that kind. That's great movie making, not simply spending lots of money finding old cars and other objects from that time and putting them in your face on the screen.It's always amazing how some low-budget movies without big stars can do a much better job of storytelling, character development and overall entertainment than the big shots with money to burn.",1,5,14,17 September 2010
The Bodyguard," I could hardly sit through this
","First of all, I never really cared for Houston's singing from the beginning of her career. It was too Ethel Merman/Carol Burnett, but at least they were fun. I preferred Dolly Parton's version of 'I will always love you' for its sweetness. It's not the kind of song that needs to be belted out at full volume. Second, I don't think she is all that beautiful either with those lifeless eyes of hers and the bitchiness came way too easy for her.Kevin Costner looks good in clothes (costumes) but has the voice of a 15 year old boy. I've never liked any of his movies or his attempts at acting.Put these 2 together and voilà, an awful, awful mess. Was the interracial love affair supposed to be daring in the 90s? Did Whitney get threatening letters for her performance in this thing as well as the character she played? Did Kevin go to Supercuts during a power blackout? We want to know.",1,12,27,25 October 2009
The Town," 'The Town Ultimatum'
","Oh, brother. I am watching it now as I turned on HBO during the chase scene and thought I was watching a Bourne movie. It's amazing how Affleck could make a car chase in the US with a Jeep Cherokee and Ford cop cars look like it was taking place in Europe. I guess Ben decided to copy the look of his friend Matt Damon's hit movies. I hate when people do that kind of cheap imitation.The interior scenes looked like I had switched channels to one of the many current cop shows, the lighting, the dialog, the clichés, the boredom.Dontcha love it when pretty boy actors deliberately try to rough up their looks and butch up their acting in 'bad guy' roles? Imagine McCauley Culkin doing a re-make of 'Scarface'. Why don't they just do drugs like Charlie Sheen and let the damage take its own course? The movie isn't over yet. I don't know if I can stay till the end.Help me!",Null,1,1,30 July 2011
The Devil Wears Prada," I watch it every time I come across it on HBO
","I can't help watching this movie even though I wasn't interested in it when it came out. Meryl Streep was scary good. I was always on edge when she was on the screen.The plot was too predictable. Small town girl succeeds in the big fashion magazine business but goes back to a smaller publishing job. I didn't care for her boyfriend and her other friends who selfishly wanted her to do something other than succeed at a new difficult job where she did, indeed, learn to produce impossible results. Miranda's recommendation at the end proved it but her friends were unsympathetic, unsupportive idiots.The last scene of the movie where Meryl is sitting in the back seat of the car- IT'S MRS. DOUBTFIRE.",7,0,0,4 October 2008
The Dark Knight," When they said 'Dark' did they mean a coal mine at night
","I just rented this from Netflix and forced myself to watch it till the end. What a dreadful, boring yet expensive movie. It was so dimly lit, they could have had any of the thousands of out-of-work actors in Southern California in it with no perceptible difference. I guess a couple more explosions would have helped (not really). I only watched it cause of Heath Ledger's excellent performance in Brokeback Mountain. Boy, was I disappointed. I didn't care about anyone while watching except for myself who was waiting for it to end. At times the dialog was difficult to understand with the volume way up but the loud soundtrack made every sound effect rattle the furniture.I just don't get what passes for great entertainment nowadays. I had to watch some old Rocky and Bullwinkle cartoons afterward as an intelligent antidote to this cartoonish movie that tries for so much significance, an odd combination. It's like looking for significance and the meaning of life in an infomercial. Don't bother.",1,70,164,23 April 2009
The Graduate," A 10. I love this movie
","I saw the Graduate when it came out and I was about 21, so lucky me. To this day, when I watch it, each scene is so perfectly crafted to evoke a variety of emotions, from anxiety to outrageous laughter to tenderness, etc.The cast was perfect. Hoffman looking dazed and confused at the beginning to becoming a man about town to a man in love chasing his woman. Katherine Ross was the ideal mid-60s young woman, beautiful, long hair although the false eyelashes are a little jarring in 2011. Her walking across campus with boots was a familiar image from back then. I recall a Life magazine photo of young woman that Ross remind me of. It was classic look. How could Ben not, you know, go for it? That scene at the end of their first date when they are at her door and she's reaching into the bag to get a french fry, then Ben walks away out of camera range and tosses the empty, crumpled bad back at her was one of those tender moments. I know it doesn't sound romantic.Ann Bancroft is a joy to watch in every scene she's in, the way she can get a waiter when Benjamin fumbles his attempts, taking off an earring to answer the phone in the bar, rubbing a spot off her top while she's undressing in the hotel room, turning on the stereo to a blast of music while 'seducing' Benjamin in the sun porch, smoking and just that sexy way Ann Bancroft is. Her boozy husband is a hoot. Ben's parents are also great in their oblivious way.I know the plot by heart and I don't try to analyze it much as I just enjoy watching the actors perform the way I enjoy a singer sing. It's artistry. Although the situations may be unusual, it seemed like we knew all of these types of people in our own lives.I've been smitten and driven long distances for love and although I wasn't seduced by my father's partner's wife, I had friends that did stuff like that or saw single mother's of friends that looked like they didn't stay home alone Saturday nights. I've seen parents like Ben's too.The movie captured something familiar yet normally experienced privately and took us on a ride as though we were living it.",10,1,1,16 March 2011
Unbroken," When more is less.
","How was it possible to make such an compelling and inspiring life story into such a boring movie despite sharks and torture? Go figure.'Lifeboat' with Tallulah Bankhead was filmed almost entirely in a lifeboat and was much more interesting than the life raft scenes in this movie which felt like twice the length of the other movie.Bridge on the River Kwai took place almost entirely in a POW camp and same comparison I made above could apply with this tedious hour or more of torture and abuse that was also boring.And how did the lead character not have a full beard after 47 days at sea. His haircut looked the same throughout his adult scenes except for being messy at times. Did his hair stop growing? The movie seemed flat and 2 dimensional. There were only 2 moments that evoked any spark of emotion or interest in me- when he was in church as a young boy and got slapped upside the head for not paying attention and the epilogue at the very end showing the real Louie running in the Olympics at age 80 but that scene was real footage and not part of Jolie's overdone, overwrought and, yet, uninspiring and yawn inducing vanity project.I don't know if it was the acting which was flat or the camera not capturing any good acting. Even closeups of Louie's face in excruciating pain or intense emotion stayed right there on the screen and didn't reach the audience. I actually heard laughter during some intense scenes. Huh? I've seen more moving teevee commercials than most of this movie was.But, Jolie isn't the only one. Many current directors work so hard at 'realism' that it is distracting. The old time directors knew how to create magic on the silver screen without having to put every excruciating detail on film. It's like they want to put a clinical pelvic exam on a video for gynecologists instead of a truly romantic scene with fully clothed actors when romance is the intention.Bette Davis was scarier as Baby Jane Hudson than the Japanese head of the POW camp.I just don't understand how Jolie could get it so wrong. Didn't she learn anything from Eastwood's 'Changeling' that left me not caring about anyone in that movie, especially Jolie herself? Even the very short scene of Louie's reunion with his family was so so contrasted to the amount of time spent on the life raft and POW scenes.It just didn't work and I hate being so critical of a movie based on such a remarkable and extraordinary long life. But, the movie didn't do Louie justice and that's as painful as watching the movie was.",4,52,92,25 December 2014
The Godfather," It' looks expensive
","I saw Godfather when it came out. I don't remember the movie but I remember going out to the lobby 2-3 times to get away from it and take a break. It was soooooooooooooo boring. It was like it was in slow motion or something and I just didn't care about anyone or anything including the plot.I recall hearing that Brando stuffed cotton balls in his cheeks to get that effect and I couldn't not think about it during the movie. It looks like a lot of movie was spent on this movie to create the look of a certain era but so what.I could see people's lips moving and hear people talking but the dialog might as well have been entirely in Italian as I had trouble paying attention. My mind would wander and I really didn't follow the plot or care. For some reason, the dialog seemed trapped in the movie itself as though I was watching it through a window that was muffling the sound a bit. Weird.Many people may think this is the best movie ever but many people also thought the earth was flat in 1491. When it comes to movies, it only matters to me what I think.",3,9,25,25 November 2010
