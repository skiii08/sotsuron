Catch Me If You Can," Spielberg's tribute to 400 Blows
","Okay, I'll accept that this is a stretch:  if it hadn't been for the scene in which our hero discovers his mother's infidelity, then it would never have occurred to me. But the similarities go beyond that:  this is another film about a young man, abandoned in a sense by his parents, fascinated by the adult world butunprepared for adult life, who slides into a life of deception.What's different? First and foremost, the happy ending. It's the truth, I suppose, and it's what we want, in that Abagnale is a likeable, very competent youngman, who succeeds where Doinel failed. Unfortunately that happy ending also negates what we see about this boy whowants to be anybody but himself. While he didn't need to remake The Grifters, a little less sunniness at the end might have made a much better movie.",Null,0,1,20 July 2003
Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy," Miscast and misdirected
","*** This review may contain spoilers ***I've read the book and seen the series, which might be a drawback in appreciating this version. But there were so many things wrong with it that made it a huge disappointment:1. As others have noted, Benedict Cumberbatch was at least a decade too young to play Guillam and lacked a certain thuggishness that made his attempts to play that role look forced. To my American eyes he looked more like a clerk behind the counter at a Starbucks.2. Toby Jones likewise was all wrong as Percy Alleline: too timid, too awkward and (pardon me) too short to be a bureaucratic intriguer. And, while I did not travel in those circles in the early 70s (or at any other time), I would have assumed that a functionary would have suppressed his Scottish accent in favor of something more Oxbridgean. Jones looked like he was trying out for the role of Yezhov in some other movie.3. Colin Firth cannot compete with Ian Richardson, who evoked Kim Philby just by his looks and manner; Firth would have done better as Guy Burgess. Richardson gave us a layered performance; Firth's was completely forgettable.4. Ciar√°n Hinds did not look remotely like a leftish academic. And, yes, I know that we don't have to stereotype every character by physical appearance, but can we at least make some sort of bow toward the characters in the book? At any rate, as far as the movie was concerned he might as well have been a piece of furniture.5. The violence (or, more accurately, the graphic display of torn human flesh and blood that represented violence that had taken place off screen) was not merely gratuitous, but tacky. It only underscored the fact that the director had no handle on the narrative and used these showpieces to substitute for what the series emphasized--what the characters did not know or knew but did not tell.6. Those tears in that scene nearly at the end of the movie. The series was engrossing, the movie was boring,",4,6,13,15 December 2011
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," Don't forget Terry Southern
","Dr. Strangelove is probably the best comedy of the 1960's, possibly the best black comedy ever and certainly Kubrick's best film.  But we need to give credit where credit is due:  Terry Southern is the person who gave us General Ripper's fixation with bodily fluids and Colonel 'Bat' Guano's certainty that Mandrake was a prevert of some sort.  In lesser hands all of this might have come off as infantile, but giving Kubrick all the credit is simply unfair.",10,1,1,6 March 2000
La Grande Illusion," How language separates us
","What makes Grand Illusion a great movie, and the reason that some of us keep returning to it, is that it can't be reduced to a single simple proposition, the way that recent war movies like Platoon ('war bad,' to quote Tarantino's synopsis) or Saving Private Ryan ('war senseless') can. It's easy to be sentimental about war, even while deploring it, by focusing on the horror of it or by making heroes out of those who are forced to fight. Renoir deals instead with the far more complex mesh of differences and alliances that separate and divide our characters. And while his main characters all have a clear class/national/religious identity, he makes much more out of them than just sociological categories.But trying to explain why Grand Illusion is such a great movie by charting all the conflicting bonds of nationality, class, religion, etc. doesn't explain why the movie is so powerful. To me it is in those scenes in which language either separates our characters (as when Marechal tries and fails to tell the British prisoners about the tunnel or asks why de Boeldieu uses 'vous') or unites them (as when von Rauffenstein and de Boeldieu speak in English or the English officer (in drag) sings the Marseillaise or when Marechal finally learns a little German). In these cases, Renoir uses language-without hitting us over the head to make the point-to illustrate the conflict between his ideal of sympathy between humans and the differences of class, nationality and religion.Now I know that this sounds just as dry and academic as other attempts to explain Grand Illusion. Maybe it is; the movie really does not need to be explained to be enjoyed. But these are the scenes that, for whatever reason, have always made the greatest impression on me.",10,118,134,27 August 1999
Braveheart," The worst, not the best, movie of the year
","Another bloated film that gets all the history wrong, turns all of the characters into stick figures and makes piles of money for the star.  The Babe Ruth Story was more accurate.  At least it gave the Irish Army something to do.",1,14,37,27 August 1999
