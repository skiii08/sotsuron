The Blair Witch Project," one great movie
","this movie was chilling, suspenseful, and incredibly realistic.  i would recommend this film to any single person.  one thing, though:  before you see the film, recognize the fact that in order to enjoy it, you must have a wild imagination, and you have to think about the movie.",9,0,0,10 August 1999
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," This movie sucks
","I never understood the huge amount of hype for the Star Wars trilogy. With Empire Strikes Back being the best one, and I still gave it a three, I'd say this is the second best, and I gave it a one.  The acting is bad.  A movie like Pink Flamingos is good with bad acting, but a movie like this needs good actors.  The plot is thinner than that of Bloodsucking Freaks, and is completely unimaginative.  It's very boring, and the only good part is the musical number, which really wasn't there in the original.  Avoid this movie.",1,22,59,18 May 1999
American Pie," Hmm
","Seeing all of these good ratings and reviews, I feel alienated speaking badly of 'American Pie.'  Yes, the movie did have it's funny moments, but like someone previously stated, this movie should not be seen by its target audience.  'American Pie' appeared to be similar to the much funnier and superior 'There's Something About Mary,' only it made feeble attempts at mimicking what was in '..Mary.'  Overall, this movie has its moments.  Only problem with it is, there's just moments.",4,1,1,25 July 1999
A Nightmare on Elm Street," Excellent.
","All I can say is, this movie terrified me.  Not just watching it, not just seeing what happened to these teenagers,  but thinking about the entire plot.  Every victim in this movie was killed in their sleep, in there dreams.  The idea that dreams can be harmfull is a mortifying one.  I had nightmares for years because of this movie.  You've got to see it at least once.  Terror at its best.",Null,0,0,29 February 2000
