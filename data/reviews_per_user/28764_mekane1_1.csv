Walk the Line," A Fantastic Film!
","Wow. I've seen this film twice but still want to see it 100 more times. This movie is one of the most moving, honest, and well done films I have seen in a long time. It opened my eyes to many things. First, to the Man in Black himself. Being a young adult, I knew very little about Johnny Cash other than his name. But through the movie I gained a huge amount of respect for him, and found that I enjoy his music. If it wasn't for this movie, I probably wouldn't have been exposed to the legend that is Cash. This film also showed me how amazing Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon are. I thought they were good actors before now, but this film truly showcased their amazing skills. Their chemistry was unbelievable. I would say it is the best work that each of them has done in their careers. They deserve lots of awards and praise for their hard work acting and singing in this film. It's incredibly impressive what they have accomplished. At the end of this movie I still wanted more, I wasn't content with leaving the life of Johnny and June and going back to the real world. It had that strong of an impact.",10,0,1,4 January 2006
