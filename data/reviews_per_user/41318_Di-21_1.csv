Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Do you really want to know the truth?
","The truth is that I was very disappointed in this film.  I went to the theater knowing I probably would be.  There was not enough story in this story.  I really think that Lucas relied too much on the CGI and not enough on real people or places.  Jar Jar was too overboard.  In the original trilogy, you didn't NEED to lean so heavily on the comedy.  It was there, but it was much more subtle.  Don't get me wrong, the film had great potential but it just didn't live up to it.  Kind of like listening to Chopin play chop sticks.  I can only hope that the next movie will bring more story and less forced laughsAnother thing that bothered me was the pod race.  Yes, we all knew how it was going to end, but I think they took up way too much time on it.  We needed more Darth Maul.  The Good v. Evil just didn't come over as good as it has in the past (future?).  There are too many plot holes to cover in this small space, but I think that even the people who loved it came away feeling just a little empty.  Classic elements were missing.  The huge ship coming over the camera at the beginning, things like that.  I would, all in all, say, it is worth seeing, but don't put too high an expectation into what you think you will get out of it.",Null,0,1,29 June 1999
