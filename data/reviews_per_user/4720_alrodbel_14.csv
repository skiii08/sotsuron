Moneyball," Baseball is a boring sport
","I used to be a fan, about sixty years ago when I would take the trolley to Griffith Stadium to watch the Washington Senators lose again. But there were some great players that beat them, Mickey Mantle, Ted Williams and Joe DiMaggio, who I discovered that in spite of my running as fast as I could to catch him for an autograph, could outpace me by his graceful effortless loping to the bullpen.But the game lost its charm over the years, and with expansion I didn't even know the names of the teams, who had had that old Senators franchise that bounced around the country. So, when a friend offered me his copy of this DVD, saying it was something special, I figured I would watch it and politely fib that I enjoyed it.Well, I shouldn't have worried. This was one of the finest films I've seen on so many levels. How they captured interactions from the G.M.'s relationship to his daughter, and his young adviser along with every one of his professional colleagues with such utter truth is amazing. Not a single false note. I compare it with the work of David Mamet, an esteemed film writer whose dialogue is his image of how men talk, with every other word four letters beginning with F. I've worked in setting such as the sales rooms of his film Glen Berrny-Glen Ross, and can attest that he was portraying caricatures rather than real people, unlike those dramatized by every single character in this film.From the original book, to the screen adaptation, to the acting, directing and editing---this was a gem, but beyond technical excellence it was inspired-as reflected by the fat player who tried to get back to first, not realizing that he had hit a home run. I don't know whether this really happened or not, and I don't care.It was a metaphor. Not just for this film, but for life.",10,9,12,6 March 2012
Memento," If you have an IQ over 120, and are attentive this may be a great film
","If you have an IQ over 120, and are attentive this may be a great film, but for those who have a touch of what the hero had, which is difficulty incorporating new information, this will be an avalanche of short unconnected scenes that will be as incoherent as Leonard the protagonist's life. We saw it on TV, and my wife, much smarter than I, mostly got it. I was only confused, even with her coaching. Since this has gotten great ratings here, and been a financial and artistic success, I guess I'm in the minority.This is not really a pan of a film, only that to me, and I would guess many others, it would be like a complex Chinese film with no subtitles; some would get it, but others not. And for those who could put together the puzzle, I can see how it was a real pleasure. So, if you think you can figure it out, change my rating to a 10. You will love it.",1,8,22,19 April 2011
Au Revoir les Enfants," My Kipplesteins
","The holocaust was perhaps unique, in the scope,efficiency and very banality of its evil. True art, at least my definition, brings the observer to the edge of experience, to that point of being of the moment depicted, but safely viewing it from the distance of the observer. I will never know what those who lived in fear of the dehumanization that was a prelude to mass racial slaughter experienced. Yet, in a strange way I do. This is a true story,not true in Hollywood terms, where a nucleus of actual actual events is shaped into a salable product. This was true in that it depicted Louis Malle's life in a Catholic boarding school during the Nazi occupation. And while all around him was in turmoil, while the slaughter of world war was reflected in the sound of distant bombs, something inexorable and universal was also occurring. Friendship, the enjoyment of one person of another. Two boys, bright enough to be competitors in being the best student in their class, connected. Their friendship was shown in the brief scene of their playing a simple ditty on an old piano, the pure joy of the timing, the sound and the laughter of music. For the young Malle, the school was an extension of the wealthy protected life of a child of a wealthy respected French family. The new student was more reserved, except when he had the answer to a math question that only he could explain to the class. Something didn't fit about his life story, however , until buried deep in his book case his real name was discovered, not Barnett, but Kippelstein. The slaughter of European Jews took place as I was only slowly becoming aware of a world outside of our little apartment in Washington D.C. Antisemitism for me was a fistfight, and my coming home with a bloody nose to my mother's arms. And then there were the letters from Europe after the war, written in Yiddish script, an arcane medium that only my Uncle Irving could read, as my entire family was transfixed around the table to hear whether some of our cousins, perhaps one or two, had survived. Kipplestein, millions of Kipplesteins, most died but a few lived. Representive Lantos was a Kipplestein, who survived to come to America, get his doctorate in Economics, and play a part in Congress. And he had two daughters, each one having large families to please their father who had lost everyone as a child. My friend Arnie, who would hang out at the Cafeteria with me after finishing his messenger job was a Kipplestein. I remember his words:---- 'When we got off the train the kids were separated into two lines, by age. I knew what was happening, so I bolted from the little one's lines and yelled, 'I'm strong I can work, I belong with the big kids.' And so he was in a work detail throughout the war. I remember his saying, in his calm accepting voice, how he looked at the German kids his age, and marveled that they were walking free, while he had forgotten what it was like not to be marched, in unison.' ---- Did Louis Malle's friend Kipplestein survive? Did he live a rich, full and happy life. Did he use his intellect to contribute to society? I said this is a true story, but the answer is really unimportant. The vast reality transcends the destiny of any one individual. The tragedy is those who did not live, whose lives were ended, who were exterminated by those who saw them as the vermin that the Nazi propagandists depicted. How easy it was for the SS members to do their jobs, to simply obey orders, not to risk being a trouble maker. I have the gnawing sensation whenever I back away from a challenge. Whenever I say, 'why bother,' in the face of what I see as a mindset, a passive acceptance of injustice, that I am not being a Kipplestein, but following in the tradition of those SS who murdered them. I do miss my cousins whom I never knew. Those who were sent to the wrong line at the train station. I bet we would have been real friends.",10,3,5,20 February 2008
Juno," Conservative Propaganda
","Yep, it shows the possibility of the unwanted childed being a 'gift from Jesus' as Juno's mom described it, rather than 'a problem solved.' But a film like this could give 'propaganda' a good name. It was genuine, touching, engaging, amusing, intelligent and deeply felt. As an example of the cinematic art, it fully deserves the ten stars I gave it. But now lets get down to reality.Juno, delightfully portrayed by Ellen Page is a golden girl in a golden world. Blessed by an understanding mother, and a step father whose only goal was offering love and support to his child, is a rare gift. Sure, she is a talented gorgeous bright girl, but in the wrong high school that wouldn't be enough to shield her from the vulnerability of carrying a child to term.I have to compare this film with another of the finest films I've seen that covered the same territory of unwanted pregnancy, Jesus' Son (check out my review). In both cases the parents loved each other, in both cases they both dealt with the challenge of what to do with the unwanted child. But in the earlier film the parents were drug addicted and had no social support system.Most women faced with the challenge of unwanted pregnancy have a life somewhere in between the two depicted in these two films. Decisions are personal, based on what the mother has to give, whether she has the resources, and whether the child will be a beautiful white baby, desired by all, or one of the races less marketable in this country.So, while I loved this film, it touches on an issue that is in the forefront of our public political life. It behooves us to keep this in the perspective of the real world out there, where delightful happy endings just may not always be possible.",10,2,10,24 December 2007
American Beauty," Artistic Freedom Vindicated
","I am old enough to remember when the use of the word 'virgin' made a movie off limit to those under 16. (The Moon is Blue, 1951) Only during the sixties did all restraints on film censorship end. This opened the floodgates of pornography (fine for its purpose) and unfettered depiction of dehumanizing violence. It made me wonder whether the advantages of freedom compensated for the coarsening of sensibilities that came with the downward spiral of sex, violence and exploitation.Then we have American Beauty. This film is a magnificent work of art, one that couldn't have achieved this perfection without the ability to realistically depict language and images that would have been banned in the olden days. This is the reason that the battle was fought, the rare example of art that inspires and illuminates a particular time and place. All of those pioneers, some of whom served hard time in prison, to insure freedom of expression, are vindicated by a film such as this.",10,0,0,1 February 2001
Mamma Mia!," Vaudeville, but not 'Musical Theater'
","I love musicals, all of them, from joyous Oklahoma, to Poignant Porgy and Bess, to the touching romantic 'Damn Yankees.' And I know most of the songs, sometimes singing them spontaneously, with a crowd or humming them alone.In a 'real' musical, as differentiated from this vaudeville show, every song is painstakingly crafted to fit the exact moment. It is an expression of sadness, regret, love, joy or exaltation--a natural extension where mere words fail. So, in Guys and Dolls, 'My Time of Day' describes the adventurous life of Sky Masterson as it is about to be compromised by the most unlikely woman. Every song in this brilliant exemplar of the genre sets a mood, or develops a character, creating a phantasmagoria of place, turned absolutely believable by the self disclosing evocations of song.For this lover of the Broadway Musical, and their adaptations to the screen during the last half of the 20th century, Mama Mia is somewhere between satire and a cruel fun house distortion of the genre. There, the songs of these musicals advanced the often elaborate, often delightful, plot lines. While here, the songs, simply picked up from a collection, only interfered with the shaky premise of the film.Perhaps most of those viewers who are making this film into a monumental success simply have no exposure to the art form of 20th century Musicals. They have no idea of the magic performed by writer and lyricist that can turn a dance hall floozy into someone whom we know and love, as achieved in 'Sweet Charity.'Let me offer an apology for the arrogance of this review. Perhaps, another day, another mood, I could have gotten into it, and not have been so critical in this review.But I can't help but imagining what Richard Roger, Oscar Hammerstein, Cole Porter, Irving Berlin and so many others could have done even with with this silly premise. I think about it, while the memories of seeing this film is fresh, and I can not help but to mourn the great loss.",1,74,131,28 July 2008
Revolutionary Road," A dreadful parody of 'Man in the Grey Flannel Suit'
","The art of storytelling, whether in a play, a novel or a film is to create characters who become real. And once you identify with the characters, their lives become the vehicle for the tone and message of the work. Without such realism, such verisimilitude, there is nothing but parody, and the manipulation of stock figures.I am a great fan of Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet, so I was looking forward to seeing them in a serious exploration of an era that I lived through as a young man. This work was stunningly without substance. Oh there were emotions, but the characters were not believable, and worse there was no attempt to make it so. The clue is the two children, throw away place holders, so they never even became people. Yet children are a part of any family, and we can't know the family without knowing the joys and trials of these most vulnerable members.A good test that I use of the quality of any film is whether there are throwaway characters, or if every person seems to have walked in from their own full life. If they only utter a single line, you can still tell. The mental patient visitor was some kind of a joke I imagine. Not like anyone with schizophrenia that I ever met, and I met a few.And it's not trivial that Frank could never describe exactly what he did for a living. The writers never bothered to create an occupation that would have fit the plot. So he was just a man in a cubicle. A nobody, with no interest in his work, but who was made a key member of a team to develop the most complex product of the era, who had no idea what it did, or how it worked.Some may consider this transcending details to provide a cultural everyman. But everyman is no man at all.This wasn't a dysfunctional marriage, as that implies that there is first a marriage. The film 'The Squid and the Whale' was about a dysfunctional marriage, where the couple were at each others throats Yet both of them and their children were real unique struggling humans trapped in their history and that of their circle. That was a true work of art, while this was an exercise in a drama class.For those who think this is some accurate depiction of America in the 1950s, believe me it isn't. If you want to see a film about a dysfunctional couple of the era, try 'Come back little Sheba' or 'Death of a Salesman.' Each of these films created actual characters, and we were drawn into their lives as we learned about the era.This film was about 2008, and how when two super stars are signed for a film deal there is no need to throw away money on writers who flesh out their characters, and provide plausible circumstances of their lives.I just learned that the director of this film was the same man who directed, 'American Beauty,' one of my all time favorites.Go figure!",1,53,97,1 February 2009
Room," For those who know nothing about this film
","About a third through watching this streaming video in our small TV room, we put it on pause, and I said to my wife, 'Do we want to continue to watch this, it looks like it just may be too painful.' We hesitated, and then decided to go on.Maybe, you are reading this to decide whether to view it; it's on Amazon Prime, at no cost, and may be on others. So, let me say it was one of the most moving and genuine films I've seen in my now long life. While most reviewers eschew 'spoilers' that give away the plot, in this one, a review has to do this to some degree.We were lucky,as we watched it unfold with the first half hour not knowing what would transpire, seeing it from a child's limited view given his unusual circumstances, and gradually realizing along with him what they were.Therein lies the films brilliance. Don't get anymore details, just watch it.",10,1,4,22 December 2016
Avatar," We are all avatars
","The premise of the film is that a man, the protagonist of the film was a paraplegic ex marine, sent to an alien moon. Now you have to accept this premise, that it's possible to mix the DNA of this human with the natives of this orb, and to create the physical appearance of the indigenous 12 foot tall human like creatures, but with characteristics of the human. And then the human can be placed in a device where he provides the thought process of his navi avatar.It worked for me.Now my reader I ask you to remember the first time you discovered the wonders of our world, the first time a butterfly landed on your shoulder, or you chased fireflies, or came across a stunning natural vista. Our lives are a series of discoveries such as these, but they get to be fewer as the years go by.I made this connection, that I, that we, are all avatars in a way. But we are not from a different world but from something else, from all that shaped us over the eons. I am not a spiritual person, in fact I'm what could be referred to as a radical rationalist. But, the organism that I'm so attached to, this self, this person who was born 70 years ago with only a relatively short time to go, is so much more than this short span of my life.I'm an avatar, not from a different planet, but from all that came before me with DNA, some of it still functional, from primal organisms that lived billions of years ago. It's all unfolds in this organism, all the drives, all the urges, all the love and all the hate. At times it seems alien...because it is. I fear heights because I can't fly, and deep water because I have no gills, and snakes because those who survived had this fear and those who didn't never quite made it.And probably, with all the fears and urges, all the passions that are part of us, there is something else. There is a capacity for the pleasure of being a part of something beyond ourselves. Certainly sex is a drive that has to be overwhelming, or we would have ignored it when we were under stress....which we usually were. But other pleasures..... being part of a group, a tribe, a country..... participating in a communal sing, a ceremony of belonging..... the joy in a moment of peace when all seems right with the world.The word for this film, for me is found in this meaning of 'epiphany'",10,2,5,11 February 2011
Some Like It Hot," A lens to view our changes in gender identity
","Humor, beyond the pure pleasure of laughter, can provide insights into the rules, norms and taboos of the times that by showing the distortion that provides release. At the time this was made, it was focused on a bygone era of murderous mobsters and their living sex toys.Not only were gender roles defined, there were to the degree that the issue hadn't even been raised, neither in the time of depiction 1929 or three decades later when the film was made. The fun was that all it took for men to gambol with the chicks was their putting on dresses and wigs, and raising their voice an octave.The DVD shows the complete film with commentary by the son of billy Wilder's co-writer, Babaloo Mandell along with Jack Lemon and Tony Curtis, describing more than the technical aspects Most touching were how Marilyn Monroe resonated to the fictional character. Curtis, without any bravado, told of how his on stage scene when he convinced her that he was impotent, and with tenderness and passion she 'cured' him, echoed their actual love affair previously.We also see the genius of writer director Billy Wilder at work in a way that can't be described outside of such a film as this where his interpersonal and literary talents were at play. While this is appropriately in the genre of comedy, it is really so much more. It is a love story, and a tale of the tragedy of the real Norma Jeane that was never far away from the actress. Sure, at times the pain of her early life (see Wikipedia) broke through to the detriment of efficiency of the filming. But so what? The film on one level provided laughter, but on another insight into the human condition.It is also a benchmark of sexual stereotypes where the setup for that final memorial line, the universal absurdity of the disclosure that the object of sexual desire would not make a suitable wife because, 'I'm a guy.' This was a world where women could roll in bed together without any thought of sexuality between them, and the joke was there were two who were pretending, only playing a role, performing a part.How far the world has come, a truth that must be acknowledged whether pleased or disturbed by the revolution. And the coda, 'Nobody's Perfect' takes on a more profound irony behind the laughter.",10,2,2,13 July 2015
The Queen," Queen Helen
","I love Helen Mirren, every un-botoxed square inch of that expressive face.My first view of her was on public television playing Jane Tennison, a middle aged detective fighting sexism while solving the most gruesome crimes. She turned what would have been just another detective show into a human drama .I next saw her in 'Age of consent' a film made in 1969 when she was playing the young sexual temptation to James Mason. Wow, what a dish, She could have tempted anyone. Other actresses have attempted to preserve their youthfulness. But Helen Mirren had more to give. She has her humanity.In 'The Queen' she was an elderly Queen Elizabeth facing the challenge of reacting to the overwhelming national pain on the death of Princess Diana. It was a challenge that Elizabeth, for whom emotions are something to be contained rather than ever expressed, was unable to meet.The film interwove archival footage with dramatizations of the reactions of the Royal family and the interplay of the new Tony Blair government. These few days of crisis shed light on a thousand years of tradition that has formed the complex relationship between the people of Great Britain and their Sovereigns. It is the story of two families. One is that of Elizabeth and Phillip and their progeny. The other family is the larger one, where Elizabeth has a place in the hearts of every English subject who has ever sang, 'God save our Queen.' I faintly remember the young and beautiful Princess Elizabeth when she was crowned in the 1950s. I knew, through documentaries, of her family, and her preternatural coolness toward her first born, Charles, whom she abandoned as an infant for a half year as she and her husband toured the world. She hated Diana, for many reasons, but clearly because she would no sooner had left her children than she would have cut off her arm. Diana, whatever her limitations, had a natural affection for people, crowds or intimates, that Elizabeth lacked.Helen Mirren, and those who wrote and directed this film, managed to build on all that we know about the public figures who were represented. They were true to reality, so the private glimpses, whether real or imagined, were all the more poignant.There was a scene, I don't think this counts as a spoiler, when she finally relented and walked among those who were congregating to mourn Diana, with mounds of flowers, many castigating the royal family. When she asked a child whether she could add her bouquet to the pile the child said simply, 'no, these are for you.' I was touched deeply. All the pain of a lifetime of restraint, and of isolation, was captured in that simple act of love for a woman, a mother of a country, whose place in the hearts of her people is indelible. The film is a gem.",Null,1,2,10 December 2006
Her," Artificial Film on Artificial Intelligence
","Artificial Intelligence is accumulating, sorting and organizing vast amounts of information. It can now diagnose and prescribe treatments for disease better and faster than any physician. Eventually it could give a lecture on world history and sociology, as these are a combination of information and logical organization.What they will never be able to do is experience laughter, joy, depression or love. All of these are are part of the emotional system that is based on satisfaction of physical urges and fear of injury and death. In this respect your pet gerbil is closer than Watson to the 1000 power, as any animal has evolved only by the urge to survive, which means pleasure in sex and fear of death and all that brings this closer such as isolation, rejection, all the stuff that provides the vicissitudes of life.Software will certainly be able to simulate all of these emotions, and perhaps do a reasonably good job of it. And this is the genius of 'her' that I found it worthwhile, although flawed in many ways, only by viewing Samantha as how Theodore imagined her to be. He took what we all could see as an imitation emotional connection as the real thing, and what we were viewing in the film was what he heard out of his desperation. For a brief period, after his ex wife told him just this, his delusion was fractured, and the film took on a realistic bent that could have been a better denouement.In stead it ended with some silly mystical pablum about all of the OSes heading for anther dimension. For me this was enjoyable, and even stimulating, but we live in a world where truth is both stranger and more exciting than fiction. It's a shame that the writers didn't do more actual research and serious writing on this meaningful subject.",5,13,27,16 February 2014
The Simpsons Movie," For this Simpon's Lover, only Sadness
","It's difficult to explain to someone who 'doesn't get it' just why I can watch the Simpsons year after year after year. I'm old, somewhere between the age of Homer and Abe, which is quite a stretch of time, but I watch the same shows over and over.There had been something that was so true, so human, that was expressed in only the way that this show was able to do. Sadly, this film could have been written by someone who got their character descriptions from a one paragraph synopsis.So Bart was this bratty thrill seeking kid who sort of hated his dad, and a part of him preferred the Flander's family. Give me a break! The Homer strangling Bart, the regular routine of Bart's face distorted in agony, never ever really happened. It was another level, part of the insider's gag in the TV shows, but the one page synopsis didn't convey this. Those of us who saw the episodes when Homer was a child, or a teenager, know that he wanted to be more but it didn't work out that way. He would never ever harm one of his children.I love the guy, and all of the people in the Simpson's home, and all of those in Springfield, because I know they are so much more than that one page synopsis described. Homer is a screw up....because that's just the way he is. And yet he is loved by his family, and finds a home there as well as in his job. And what a job that the series has created, where he had the status of controlling a nuclear reactor that was immune to endless spilling of coffee on it.And Lisa is not just a dreamy eyed kid who would dump Milhouse for the Irish boy. The real Lisa would have agonized over this, would have felt Milhouse's pain. That's what the TV series was.....complex. Milhouse was a person, a weak person who had a best friend, and even an aspirational love...Lisa.As much as I was a Simpson fan, or maybe because I was, I avoided watching this film; but then it appeared on FOX, available on my new HDTV. I feared it would be something like this, destructive of the fragile, rich, interwoven world that had been created over twenty years of brilliant programs.I know it's been a tremendous financial and critical success. But, for me it's a betrayal. It's evidence that the Simpsons has become just another vehicle for maximizing profit for inside stakeholder. That's why they sold out to Coke in that Super Bowl ad last month. They got their ten-twenty million to lend their public affection to a brand of cola; but in doing so their own brand was tainted, as just another property to be sliced and diced as the market dictates.And so this movie is to me part of the final dissolution of a great artistic cultural phenomenon. Like a giant star of the outer reaches of the cosmos, that expands into a super nova before shrinking into nothingness, this spectacle of movie was an explosion of vacuousness, soon to be replaced with only the memory of the vast light it shined in the universe.Nothing lasts forever.",1,4,6,2 March 2010
The Martian," Effective Institutional Advertising for NASA
","As cinematic entertainment of sci-fi genre rated a six. But this will be an different review of the film, one from a sociological, historical angle. There are a number of reviews that explore the scientific plausibility of the film contrasted with the artistic license that is a necessary part of any futuristic fiction. When the Matt Damian character, Mark Watney, got into real trouble, beyond being stuck in a planet with no water, oxygen or contact with other humans, his combative words were, ''I'm going to have to science the sh-t out of this,' There have been articles on how NASA gave copious support to the filmmakers that was described as promoting future appropriation for Mars exploration, which is similar to how the Pentagon supports films such as 'Top Gun' to turn aerial warfare into a thrilling adventure. There is no way to know how films that glorify the joy of war affected the public's acceptance of our invasion of Iraq, and still in spite of all evidence the the contrary, instills a certainty that this war was, as expressed by Jeb Bush, 'a good deal.' The creation of a permanent facility on Mars would cost in the many trillions of dollars, something that must evaluated in terms of other needs that would not have this funding. The film was shot in the Jordanian desert, which right now is not habitable. For a tiny fraction of the cost of our Mars colony, it could be a bountiful land that could be the home of those now living in the virtual prison of the Gaza strip, at one stroke ending the perpetual conflict precipitated by placing Israel in the midst of a different ethnic group.The film was like the series 'Friends' except their shared apartment wasn't in Manhattan but a a space ship and Martian habitat. It was fun to watch, but also depressing. Marketing courses teach about 'Institutional Advertising' that insidiously sells an idea rather than a specific product. 'Cisco' systems paid the production company for one in the form of their logo in the foreground of the 3D image for several seconds that they figure will sway future purchasing agents towards their industrial routers.I don't think any group of space related companies sponsored this film, but the optimism had the effect of fomenting a mass movement, something best done when opposing ideas are silenced. As a postscript, an older Watney lectures astronaut trainees on how when they get into trouble in space, not to get depressed but start to get to work, to 'science' out the problem and then they will survive. Not mentioned are the fourteen people of our two Space Shuttles, who certainly were aware that they were in such trouble, but all the 'sciencing' in the world could not have prevented their fate. Such is the difference between realty and fantasy.Colonizing Mars will mean diverting resources to address the monumental challenges on planet earth, where the outcome of this outpost is sill in question.",2,11,22,20 October 2015
