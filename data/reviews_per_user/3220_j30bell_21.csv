Mission: Impossible III," Cruise Control slips into third gear
","Ooooh scary  and that's just Tommy's collection of teeth. There simply must be a scene with Tom (from Tom & Jerry) playing them like a clavichord after the Cruiser gets biffed with a frying pan. But I digress Following the first MI, dumber US teenagers, who appear to be the staple of Hollywood screen tests, complained that the plot left them confused. Poor loves! And so MI:II was born: simple plot (Face Off, for teletubbies); premise summaries every five minutes (in case you've got bladder problems or are trying to watch the film and play Grand Theft Auto) and a director whose reputation for brooding cogitations on the dynamics of the human psyche fell somewhat short of, say, Tony Scott.Fortunately MI:III is a definite improvement on John 'Hard Boiled' Woo's bewildering (if impressive) collection of clichés and personal leitmotifs. It starts, oooh, dark; it messes around with a non-linear storyline (well, almost); it's got something more than a comedy villain in the fantastically sadistic Philip Seymour Hoffman; and overall it could just about pass as a decent, if slightly bonkers, spy thrillerexcept there are many, many jarring and incongruous moments in the film.Take for example the opening sequence. Excellent acting, some wonderful (if brief) suspense building up to an emotive final gunshot. Screen goes blank, cue jaunty opening theme. Hmmm. Don't get me wrong, the opening scene is a cracker, and the theme tune is necessary. But put them together and it just doesn't work.The film is full of these mistakes. Take, for example, the comedy. Used wisely, comedy can lighten the mood, allow an audience to draw breath, and generally introduce some dynamic range. Done badly, however, and it jars painfully with the rest of the material. In MI:III it is done badly. In fact Ethan Hunt's mood changes quicker than a hormonal, sofa-jumping celeb on Oprah. One moment he's ruthless, single-minded and driven, and the next he's cracking a joke.While we're on the subject of life mirroring art, why is Ethan's wife a spitting image of whats-her-face the bland one from Dawson's Creek? The Cruiser is a great actor (if a bit lazy recently) but, frankly, I could have done without this forcible reminder of his freakshow of a personal life. We paid to see Ethan Hunt, not Tommy K.Finally, there's the valedictory last scene. You know the one you get on American Soap re-union specials: Cheers, for example, where they all stand around and wave? Yeah, it was that horrible. Not as horrible as the end of The House of Flying Daggers, but Not Good.Which is a shame, because it's a jolly entertaining piece of cinema when it's not buggering it up for the sake of 'humour' and/or sentimentality. MI films are never going to be cerebral, and I thoroughly enjoyed it when I wasn't scaring the natives of West India Quay, E14 by slapping my forehead and screaming Noooooo! in a very loud voice. Tom slipped briefly out of Cruise Control and into 3rd. Big Phil alone justifies the price of admission. I don't think I recall seeing anyone in a mainstream movie so thoroughly and believably vile. Good film. Go and see it. Take a sick bag for the ending.Oh yes, and (spoilers) waking up from being dead is not the same as waking up from a bad dream. Please can you remember that for next time? I laughed. I know I wasn't supposed to, but I did.",6,5,10,5 May 2006
Minority Report," An addition to the compendium of Spielberg might-have-beens - SPOILERS
","This film is worth watching for lots of reasons. The best is Philip K. Dick's dystopian vision. And the acting is good too: Cruise as the high priest of pre-crime, catching murderers before they commit their offences using the mysterious power of the 'pre-cognitives'; Max Von Sydow adding his usual air of gravitas (how can Hollywood justify treating him so badly?) The look of the film is somewhere between Total Recall and the leeched colours and retro chic of Gatacca. Others have commented on the plot, so I'm not going to; it's good enough. Would have been better without the last 10 minutes, but Blade Runner suffered the same affliction. Suffice to say - for those who prefer to switch off Blade Runner after Gaff turns to say, It's too bad she won't live, but then again, who does?  the ending for MR will probably set your teeth grinding too. But this is just one problem.Firstly, the film is a real cut and paste job. It looks like Gatacca, has the plot twists of Total Recall, has that media-savvy thing from Robocop. All good stuff, all been done. OK, so this is a better film than his mate George Lucas would have made, but this just goes to prove that Spielberg is still more of an engineer than an artist.And if it is meant to be SF film noir, it's a very white shade of black. Spielberg seems to shy away from anything the least edgy (note the keystone cops chase with the jetpack - 'but, yee, we can't have our hero hurt any good guys' and the comedy fight between Anderton and Witwer). Even Peter Stormare is less Hannibal Lecter and more the comedy-Russian he played on Armageddon. Then there is the riding off into the sunset ending. Can someone please explain to me what would have been wrong with Cruise ending up in the vault and Max Von Sydow, turning his collar up against the rain, walking out of a bustling pre-crime department to the sound of Schubert's 8th Symphony? Von Sydow's should be the most interesting character in the film  and the man worked with Bergman for goodness sake  why not use him.SF films have a reputation for being more 'deep' than they really are. A few manage to be thought-provoking though (2001, Bladerunner, Gatacca). One of the key things that sets them apart seems to be a willingness to leave the audience thinking about what the film is trying to say. All the audience is of MR is left with is the feeling that 'well, that's alright then.' Enjoyable. 6/10just.",6,52,81,20 December 2004
Monty Python's Life of Brian," A Masterwork of British Comedy
","In Life of Brian, Python created what John Cleese called simply 'our masterpiece'. As a piece of writing, it is the most impressive of the three feature length Python movies. The scenes remain episodic, but there is a much more coherent narrative than in the earlier Holy Grail  I loved HG too, but for different reasons. The characters (well about one or two of the characters) have acquired some subtle shading, which is rare in comedy and, alas, rare in British comedy in particular. The plight of Chapman's Brian is one that I really cared about (although his death is also extremely funny, upbeat and one of the truly iconic moments in British cinema).The story must be fairly well known. Brian is born at the same time as Jesus with whom he leads a kind of parallel life, thus allowing the team to lampoon and satirise everything from religious zealotry and mob hysteria to 1950s biblical/sword & sandals epic cinema. It does this by marrying historic situations with more modern attitudes; thus we have revolutionary Stan who wants to be Loretta and have the right to have babies, the old man who can't understand why he's being stoned for saying simply 'that piece of halibut was good enough for Jehovah!' the gruff centurion correcting Brian's Latin grammar while he's trying to daub anti-Roman slogans on a wall and the gentle centurion asking each of a line of the condemned 'crucifixion? Good' while ticking them off on his clipboard. Interspersed with this is slapstick, pantomime women (I'm not sure there are any real women in Python, which is probably its greatest failing) and a small amount of the trademark Python surrealism (the spaceship, the 'prophet' talking about the sons misplacing the things owned by their fathers who had placed them down only just a moment ago etc). In short, something for everyone  except, perhaps, committed Christians.A lot of attention has been paid to whether LoB is blasphemous. The Pythons claim not and I'm not sufficiently religious to care very much. On the surface, I disagree. There are also occasional sideswipes at ancient Jewish custom  although, to be fair, only stoning which, if you'll pardon the pun, might be considered a fair target. Jesus is not criticised, but the film's central message seems to be; be in the right place at the right time and even a man called Brian can become God. Almost the last line is from Eric Idle saying; 'you come from nothing and go back to nothing' which doesn't suggest that the man on the mount at the beginning is a divinity, no matter whether he's talking sense or not.Most importantly though, LoB is refreshingly satirical. There always was an element of this in Python (mediaeval Christian philosophy lampooned in the Holy Grail for example 'this new learning amazes me Sir Bedevere, explain again how sheeps' bladders may be employed to prevent earthquakes so, if she weighs the same as a duck, she must be made of wood, and therefore - a witch'. I guess LoB attracted attention because the satire had never been so bold or obvious before. This is also what makes LoB such an incredibly funny film to watch; but put it this way  despite what Rowan Atkinson may have once said  I'd be very surprised if the Python's weren't expecting the Spanish Inquisition.That shouldn't put you off, though. Unless your faith is too weak to survive Python's gentle humanism, watch this movie  you'll probably love it.",9,198,272,20 December 2004
12 Monkeys," Full of Gillian-isms, Empty of Willis-isms - in a good way...
","There is a story (possibly apocryphal) about an exchange between Bruce Willis and Terry Gilliam at the start of Twelve Monkeys. Gilliam (allegedly) produced a long list (think about the aircraft one from the Fifth Element) and handed it to Butch Bruce. It was entitled 'Things Bruce Willis Does When He Acts'. It ended with a simple message saying: 'please don't do any of the above in my movie'.There is a fact about this movie (definitely true). Gilliam didn't have a hand in the writing.I would contend that these two factors played a huge role in creating the extraordinary (if not commercial) success that is The Twelve Monkeys.Visually, the Twelve Monkeys is all that we have rightly come to expect from a Gilliam film. It is also full of Gilliamesque surrealism and general (but magnificent) strangeness. Gilliam delights in wrong-footing his audience. Although the ending of the Twelve Monkeys will surprise no one who has sat through the first real, Gilliam borrows heavily from Kafka in the clockwork, bureaucratic relentless movement of the characters towards their fate. It is this journey, and the character developments they undergo, which unsettles.I love Gilliam films (Brazil, in particular). But they do all tend to suffer from the same weakness. He seems to have so many ideas, and so much enthusiasm, that his films almost invariably end up as a tangled mess (Brazil, in particular). I still maintain that Brazil is Gilliam's tour de force, but there's no denying that The Twelve Monkey's is a breath of fresh air in the tight-plotting department. Style, substance and form seem to merge in a way not usually seen from the ex-Python.Whatever the truth of the rumour above, Gilliam also manages to get a first rate (and very atypical) performance out of the bald one. Bruce is excellent in this film, as are all the cast, particularly a suitably bonkers - and very scary - Brad Pitt.It's been over a decade since this film was released. When I watched it again, I realised that it hadn't really aged. I had changed, of course. And this made me look at the film with fresh eyes. This seems to me to be a fitting tribute to a film that, partly at least, is about reflections in mirrors, altered perspectives and the absurd one-way journey through time that we all make. A first rate film. 8/10.",8,115,150,23 November 2006
The Fifth Element," Armageddon with irony
","A friend of mine once observed that the real problem with The Fifth Element is that it wasn't in French; that had Luc Besson opted to make it in his native tongue all would have been well. He may have a point, but it's still a terribly overoptimistic analysis.The Fifth Element has to be one of the silliest films ever made: the barking mad plot, the comedy villain, the comedy 'bad race' of Org, the crazy costumes, the crazy music, the Blade Runner with laughs script, the sci-fi icons (like Ian Holm and Brion James). It should be terrible; it is terrible! But it's also marvellous. Marvellously camp, marvellously entertaining and great fun. The difference between this and Big Bruce's Armageddon is that Fifth Element is in on the joke  in a very in-your-face way, but it is. Contrast near-identical Bruce lines in each film (the 'why d'ya call me' line). In Armageddon, the question is taken seriously, in Fifth Element they play it for the joke it is 'firstly, out of all of your unit, you're the only one qualified to fly all these space-craft' - cue the unrolling of an improbably long list - 'secondly, of all of your unit, you're the only one still alive'.This is The Mummy in Space  two hours of almost unrelenting silliness punctuated with some wonderful pastiches  the best and the most hilarious being Chris Tucker's Ruby Rhod  if you didn't realise he's supposed to be Prince it might be classified as ridiculous (what am I saying? It is ridiculous, but it's also bloody marvellous).The genius in this film is really in the casting. Butch Bruce, when left to his own devices, is capable of producing high grade camembert, and once again delivers on that. It's just that here it's so perfect. Ian Holm seems to be rehashing his role in the borrowers rather than Alien. Gary Oldman seems to have been pinching ideas (and costumes) from Max Von Sydow in Flash Gordon. And then there is LeeLoo, the films one original creation, who is played majestically by Milla Jovovich.If it strikes you that I like this film rather too much; well, I agree. I mean, I know this film is trash but it is, nevertheless, the kind of trash people put in a gallery and call art. Surprisingly re-watchable. 6/10.",6,9,18,6 January 2005
Pan's Labyrinth," A fey, beautiful and dark masterpiece
","Set during Franco's mopping up exercise after the Spanish Civil War, Guillermo Del Toro's Pan's Labyrinth is a wonderful, dark fairy tale that, in a metaphor for Spain itself, teeters on the edge of nightmare dreamscapes of corruption, violence and the death of innocents.This film is definitely not for young children. Although the fantasy sequences are gorgeously realised, and are fairy tales in the truest sense (in that they are dark, fey, dangerous and violent), most of the story (about three quarters of it, in fact) exists outside of the dreamland, in the even more frightening (and sometimes shockingly violent) world of a real life struggle of ideas and ideology.Sergi Lopez is excellent as the brutal (and possibly sadistic) Falangist Captain tasked with routing out the remaining leftists from the woods and hills of Northern Spain. Into this precarious situation come his new wife (a widow of a former marriage, who is carrying his son) and his stepdaughter Ofelia (played to absolute perfection, by the then 11 year old, Ivana Baquero).Uncomfortable with her new surroundings, suspicious of her stepfather and desperately concerned about the worsening condition of her mother, Ofelia uncovers a strange alternative world, and the chance to escape forever the pain and uncertainty of her everyday life.Thus the film alternates between the world of Civil War Spain and the increasingly bizarre, dark and frightening world of the Pan's Labyrinth. As the twin plots progress, they intertwine, with the tasks of Ofelia becoming the choices faced by a Spain at the crossroads. The poignancy of the film lies partly in the fact that the victories of the child are reflected so starkly by the failures of the adult world.Apparently Pan's Labyrinth won a 20-minute standing ovation at Cannes, when it was shown. This may be a little bit over the top. I suspect when the furore has died down some will choose to swing the pendulum back and criticise it for its more obvious faults. Much of the film is derivative. There are few ideas in the film's magical dreamworld that haven't been seen before. There are also few ideas in the film's depiction of the Civil War that can't be read in Satre or Orwell; can't be viewed in Picasso's Guernica; or can't be watched in Land and Freedom.For all the evident truth of these observations, to accept them would be to entirely miss the majesty of Pan's Labyrinth, which doesn't lie in its originality but its absolute mastery of execution. People will watch Pan's Labyrinth in a way that most won't watch Land and Freedom. In doing so, they will also discover a world of fairy tales which existed before Disney sunk its claws into them: a dangerous world, where nothing is as it seems and every step is a possible death  a place which may leave even adults shivering under the duvet, part in terror, part in wonder. And all this backed up by the finest cinematography I've seen.The only real faults I am prepared to allow for this film is a slight tendency (particularly at the end) for a Narnia-like moralism, and the fact that the faun is, perhaps, is not quite wild enough! These are eminently forgivable, though. This is easily the best film I've seen this year, and a must see on the big screen.",9,722,888,23 November 2006
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Beautiful, if breathless, adaptation
","If you want to know how to do the impossible, watch Peter Jackson's Fellowship of the Ring. When I was growing up, I thought no one could translate such a sweeping book onto the screen successfully, and yet the man who brought us Bad Taste has done it. Just so you know in advance, the film takes plenty of liberties with the story; no Old Forest, Bombadil, Barrow Wights or Glorfindel. No Wargs in the wilderness - and you have to wait until the third film to see Narsil re-forged. In fact if the film has a serious fault it is that so much of the story is cut, it could leave the audience breathlessly hurtled from one action sequence to another - dazed, and maybe (if you haven't read the book) even a bit confused. But what the film does so successfully is recreated the atmosphere of the story - rather impressive considering the film is shorn of much of the textual richness found in the book. As someone who has read LoTR more times than a man of sound judgement ever should, I found myself more engrossed in the story than I had been for years. The film gets its atmosphere from the scenery, the camera-work and some beautifully adept computer enhancement. In many cases the characterisation was also richer than the original - both Aragorn and Arwen are significantly more 'human' than in the novel, as is Gandalf. Tolkien's heroes are often to perfect to be truly interesting - after all, in Mallory, it is no co-incidence that Galahad finds the Grail, but two thirds of the book is about Tristan and Lancelot. In Jackson's LoTR we see the human frailties of the characters; Aragorn's self doubt, Gandalf's fear, Elrond's unconcern (basically, 'you deal with it Gandalf, I'm off on holiday with all the other elves'). This is not to say the film is without its flaws. Whoever decided that elves needed...tooo...speak ....sooo.....slowly clearly needs shooting - as does the guy who thought that a WWF-style wrestling match between Gandalf and Saruman was a good idea. Indeed there are a number of moments when a lighter directorial touch would have been better. Galadriel's demon-witch impression, for example, or Gandalf's power-vocalisation at the Bridge of Khazad-Dum. Merry and Pippin have a rather disconcerting resemblance to Ant and Dec (all three films show an astonishing heightism, more of which later). Nevertheless, this film is an enormously impressive attempt do something I though next to impossible. At over three hours it was a long, but thoroughly enjoyable, action/fantasy film; it makes Star Wars looks like the kind of tenth-rate kiddie movie it is. And the best thing is, the special addition is even better. So not perfect, but 8/10 anyway",9,27,41,20 December 2004
Armageddon," Alas, the end of the world was not nigh
","While watching this film, I was reminded of the futility of trusting politicians. This moment came when the President of the United States said 'the bible calls this time Armageddon - the end of all things'It's a sad fact, but life is never that kind.When big, bad, balding, butch Bruce looks solemnly into the camera and, with creditable sincerity, delivers the line 'six billion people on the planet, why d'ya call me?' you know something special is afoot. Lesser men - Lawrence Olivier, maybe, or Alec Guinness - would have cringed at the thought of having to deliver such verbiage without an ironic sneer. Not Bruce. Bruce, like the women of Sunset Strip, is a pro. Either that, or ironic sneers were not required in his contract. Judging by the rest of the film, neither were shame, dignity or self-respect.Were there ever to be an unholy union between Top Gun and Cobra, the cinematic wreckage that would result might resemble Armageddon. It's a testosterone fuelled, guttural paean to trailer park America.In many Hollywood films, for instance, technical jargon is used to pad out a dull script. Armageddon is no exception, except that here the writers clearly couldn't be bothered to find any real jargon and just made stuff up. Zero Barrier for example - what the hell is that? Freedom is 'off the Grid' I mean pleeease! Jargon this implausible hasn't been heard since the British Government implored junkies not to shared their 'works'. Even taking into account the fact that I was hardly expecting Woody Allen, it's just awful.Special effects wail around the vacuum where the story is supposed to be, looking for something to do, looking for something to affect, looking to go bang. It's not surprising then that, many, many things bang in this film - and I'm not talking about Ben Afleck. Immediately following a distasteful little scene where our Bruce is driving golf balls at people in a Greenpeace boat, and playing it for the hilarious laughs such behaviour obviously deserves, his Oil Rig explodes. Then his test rig at NASA explodes, then the Russian Space Station, then a Space Shuttle, Then a Thermonuclear Device, followed shortly (and mercifully) by himself.Things go bang, then. Good basis for a multi-million dollar film project.But by far and away the most depressing thing about this film is the cast list. Leaving aside the bald one, whose occasional forays into the world of acting we already knew to be liberally interspersed with pap of the highest order, there's Steve Buscemi (not only a good actor, but a very decent director), Billy Bob Thornton, Ben Afleck, Michael Clarke Duncan, Jason Isaacs, Peter Stormare (who somehow manages to steal it, though give it back, I say) - I mean even Owen Wilson. Do none of these people know better? Obviously not.Some will no doubt say that I am being a curmudgeon, and that not all films need to explore the 'depths of humanity'. I agree.Unfortunately, this film does explore the depths of humanity, it just doesn't realise it's doing it. 2/10",2,41,84,23 December 2004
Saving Private Ryan," Dirty Dozen for the 90s
","There was a time when Spielberg felt the film-making fraternity had overlooked him. Those days may be over, but the reasons why it happened, sadly, are not. The lesson seems to be, make a film about the holocaust and be magically transformed into a critical heavyweight.The sad fact is that Schindler's List is (in my opinion) a very good film, but not a great one  it is too heavy handed. I am in a minority. Likewise, bolt on 20 minutes of startling cinematography (which was not part of the original Spielberg grand plan) and transform a fairly pedestrian, unoriginal war-is-naughty-but-devilishly-exciting flick into a major cinematic event.Can someone who loves this film as Art (I choose capitals for its ironic effect) explain how it was that the film managed to spawn a whole series of computer games? Were Spielberg's motives so noble, so pure and so righteous that he had to further propagate his 'war-is-naughty' message to the fans of first person shoot-em-ups? Now you may argue that it is hardly Spielberg's job to worry about such things. This may be true  but you have to wonder why it was that Saving Private Ryan is so eminently suited to such a transfer. It is difficult, for example, to anticipate a Thin Red Line or Apocalypse now video game. It would also difficult to paste scenes from Thin Red Line onto, say, Star Wars (the Millennium Falcon coming out of the sun, for example) and not be able to spot the difference.At best Saving Private Ryan is a lukewarm, melodramatic, overly sentimental paean to good ole America, good ole family and the importance of killing nasty Germans before they kill you. The beach landing is extraordinary  I'm not denying it. But pardon me if I'm holding out for something more subtle. 5½ /10",5,10,20,2 February 2005
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," Beware of cheap imitations
","Crouching Tiger is Ang Lee's take on the Wu Xia tradition of film making. Wu Xia, for those not familiar with the style, evolved out of popular Chinese fiction. It contains formulaic elements such as honourable warriors, powerful swordswomen, powerful swords, and often magic and mythical beasts. Possibly, it has a parallel with sword and sorcery pulp literature  and even Western romances.Although he grew up in Taiwan, not Hong Kong or China, Ang Lee has said he has always wanted to make a Wu Xia film. When he did, he brought sophistication and strong production values which, while not uncommon in mainstream Chinese cinema, was less common in the martial arts or Wu Xia traditions.Make no mistake; Crouching Tiger is a beautiful, beautiful movie. The colours are rich, the light dances and the movements are balletic. But unlike lesser imitations, such as Hero, it is much more than that just stylish production and mesmerising action.Most films (Western or Eastern) have a rigid plot against which characters move. At worst the characters become ciphers; they advance the story by making choices regardless of whether these choices are in keeping with their character. Crouching Tiger, like the best of cinema, has dynamic characters whose internal struggles advance the plot. The dog wags the tail, not the other way around.At the heart of Crouching Tiger is the relationship between Li Mu Bai (Chow Yun-Fat) and Yu Shu Lien (Michelle Yeoh). Mu Bai is looking for a way out of the Gang Ho (Warrior) lifestyle  he joins a monastery, as a route to enlightenment and peace, but cannot cast aside his unrequited love for Shu Lien (another warrior). On the brink of declaring their love for one another, Mu Bai's Green Destiny Sword is stolen, and his arch enemy returns. He must temporarily put aside his feelings to recover the sword and bring his master's killer to justice Seeming to take a fair chunk from his previously directorial role, Sense and Sensibility, Ang Lee weaves a story which tragically juxtaposes the loving and giving but repressed relationship of Mu Bai and Shu Lien, with the fiery, wilful and destructive passions of Jen Yu (Zhang Ziyi) and Lo (Chang Chen). The result, for me, was breathtaking.Some critics have suggested that the characterisation is quite slight. I think this just demonstrates the high standard to which they were prepared to judge this film. Ang Lee perfectly marries action/adventure with drama. The results may not please purists from either camp, but for the rest of the audience it is pure magic.In many ways, Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon is pure Wu Xia. But it has also re-invented the genre and given it artistic credibility. The greatest joy of the film is watching great Hong Kong stars like Chow Yun-Fat and Michelle Yeoh being given characters with depth  and watching them fill the screen with their performances. The film also benefits from great performances from Zhang Ziyi and a very under-rated Chang Chen.Quite simply, Crouching Tiger has everything. It is beautiful, breathtaking and deeply moving. 9½ /10",10,213,280,22 December 2004
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," The story - and the heightism - continues
","In the Two Towers (TT) we are re-united with most of our heroes from the Fellowship of the Ring (FotR). Split apart by betrayal, and a company of orcs, Frodo and Sam have begun the last leg of their quest to Mordor. Ant and Dec (sorry, Merry and Pippin) are prisoners of the orcs, pursued by Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli  a quest that brings the company, and the people of Rohan, closer to conflict.Opinion is divided about the second film. The entertainment junkies seem to think it's better than the first, largely on account of the Battle of Helms Deep, which is rather impressive. I thought it was a bit weaker, mainly because, in a wilderness adventure, there's more emphasis on the characters than in the spectacle of set piece action; and because the CGI is less subtle as a result.Once again, liberties are taken with the story. There's no riding of the Grey Company. There's a more obvious tension between Eowyn and Aragorn (Legolas has to remind Aragorn who he's dating), and (controversial among the Tolkienites) Faramir's character has been darkened somewhat. In fact, the directorial trait of adding more colour to the main characters while painting out the subtlety of the peripheral ones continues from FotR. Partly because we're introduced to more characters in TT, the overall effect leaves the film slightly two-dimensional. On balance I thought the treatment of Faramir to be less heinous than that of Denethor in Return of the King, but more on that later.The mood, though, remains pure Tolkien and that, more than anything, is the triumph of the movie. From the Beowulf-like set for Meduseld (Tolkien famously nicked his description of the seat of Rohan from the UK's first epic) to the majestic sweep of New Zealand, the film more than once reminded me of my own mental images of Tolkien's world. And, once again, I found myself interested in the story.So, to the flaws. I mentioned in an earlier review of FotR the astonishing heighism in Peter Jackson's adaptation. You can imagine Jackson scratching his head wondering what to do for laughs now that Ant and Dec have been nicked by Ugluk, Grishnakh and the lads. His solution is ingenious; find the next shortest member of the company. Gimli, therefore, shoulders the mantle of comedy relief. As a strapping man of 6'4'' I am allowed a certain disdainful disinterest to such a phenomenon; but it is worth noting. Also worth noticing is the astonishing transformation of Arwen from a feisty, most un-Tolkien lady in FotR to the submissive pre-Raphaelite stereotype of the books. I guess this is because Eowyn has turned up, but still. The Elves still speak like they're doped up, except the peculiarly immune elfin fancy boy, Legolas. On that note, was it really necessary for him to mount his horse that way? Or surf his way down a staircase at the battle of Helms Deep? Jim Horner should do an alternative Beach Boys theme for that scene.Anyway, these are minor points in a film that is, if not a major, then at least a minor, triumph. As mentioned by others, the film is worth seeing for Gollum alone. And I can think of many more reasons to see it. You could also check out the extended version, which is even better. 7/10.",7,16,28,20 December 2004
Schindler's List," A heart warming tale of mass murder and genocide
","'Gawd bless you mister Schindler', is one of the few phrases not to appear in Schindler's list, which is useful in that it enables us to distinguish it from a Frank Capra film. Well, to be fair, the phrase 'Shoot her now, on my authority' isn't in It's a Wonderful Life either. Schindler's List - the story of a war profiteer who saves the lives of over a thousand Jews from Krakow Ghetto during WWII - is one of the Sacred Cows of modern cinema. This is partly because of its subject matter, the excellent performances of the three lead actors, and the epic length and flashy direction of Stephen - ooh what a long film I'm making (it's in black and white y'know) - Spielberg. Schindler's List is a good film, and there are some performances of real note. Kingsley reprises his role as Gandhi and Fiennes and Neeson look fab in black and white. There is also nice mutual tension and understanding between Schindler and Goeth, which makes their scenes together really watchable. Having said all that, the film can be really infuriating. Why, for instance, does Spielberg try to blur the film/history distinction by shooting it in black and white and having real holocaust survivors turn up at the end? Does the film really need this kind of 'legitimacy' for audiences to take it seriously?And where are the Jewish characters? I can almost hear Spielberg with his screenwriters... 'Woody, hi, I'd like you to do Schindler and Goeth'. 'Ah, but, you know, like, that sounds great! But what about the Jews huh - I think I could do really good job with some of the Jewish Characters' Woody Allen replies. 'Yeah, hear what you say Woody, but I've promised that to my old buddy George Lucas - he's getting in some practice for a project he's working on called the Yellow Peril, or the Phantom Menace or something'. One review of Schindler's List describes Stern as 'Schindler's conscience' and that's just about it. Spielberg has outsourced his casting for Jewish characters to Jimny Cricket, which is a real shame because, apart from anything else, it denies them their humanity.In fact, you don't have to be a particularly attentive viewer to see Spielberg's less-than-light touch all over this film. You get the sophisticated monster cliché, with the Stormtrooper playing Mozart (suspiciously well) on an old upright piano during the liquidation of the Krakow Ghetto. You get the violent guard cooing over a Jewish baby 'Ein kind, ein kind!' You get the Goeth proving how evil he is by hitting his maid. And, of course, you get that ridiculously over-sentimental ending where Schindler makes his final transition to Avatar of the Almighty.Then there's the death. Young girls and boys are killed, women are killed, old folk kick it - I wouldn't be surprised if the tragic death of a young girl's fluffy rabbit only just made the cutting room floor. But, you know, I struggle to remember any adult Jewish man between 18 and 60 killed on camera. Did these deaths not count? David Irving would be delighted.However the holocaust has been used subsequently, it remains one of the most significant and tragic events in European history. It deserved a great film treatment and it nearly got it. Tragically, though he got great performances from his cast and had one of the best stories going, Spielberg was unable to forget he was the same director that brought us ET and Close Encounters. Surely the point about Schindler's story is that, however bad a person is, and however black the times are, everyone has a responsibility to do good when the world is going bad. The danger of this film is that the MTV generation might regard it as a clarion call for inaction  there'll always be a saint like Oscar Schindler along to do the good work for you. 7/10.",7,8,20,20 December 2004
Hero," Worthless Crouching Tiger Cash In
","From the Hong Kong actors to the Tan Dun score this reeks of a Crouching Tiger cash in by director Zhang Yimou . Unfortunately, Hero is all style and painfully little substance. In fact, on the rare occasion when you get substance or ideas, they are usually so abhorrent you'd have rather they hadn't bothered.Briefly, the story centres around a nameless one - the man with no name - (Jet Li) an assassin. He has killed three enemies of the Qin Emperor who, in reward, has granted him an audience. As the two men talk, three versions of the Hero's story are told, exploring themes such as loyalty, honour and revenge. Each dominated by a prevailing colour. This all sounds very interesting. Problem is, it isn't. It's 96 minutes of exquisitely pushed out excrement. But let's concentrate on the good points for a minute.Maggie Cheung and Tony Leung are excellent. OK, may be that took less than a minute.So what's wrong with this film. Well firstly there is no character development, just a few good looking Chinese folk waving swords in a mildly diverting manner (think the opening ceremony of the forthcoming Beijing Olympics). Because of this you can't really give a monkey's about any of the characters, least of all Jet, who scowls his way through the movie without ever giving you the impression that there's anything more meaningful on his mind than the sweet sound of sword on flesh.Then there is the up-its-own-bottom-pseudo-artiness of it. There is an important point here. In Crouching Tiger, when Chow Yun-Fat and Zhang Ziyi dance on top of the bamboo forest, it is beautiful, not because the colours are rich, the imagery is splendid and movement is graceful. Li Mu Bai is a character you care for, showing a nobility of spirit we would like to aspire to. Ang Lee has already engaged you in his story, you want to believe he can do it. Cue Tony Leung's spot of calligraphy while Jet Li and Maggie Cheung ward off a cloud of arrows. Graceful? Yes. Colourful? Yes. Foetid brace of severed cojones? Unfortunately so.I mean there are so many reasons to dislike this film I could go on all day. But, since the main function of this review is to spare you the effort of seeing this worthless piece of tripe, let's finish on the one idea this film pushes out in its hour-and-a-half passage through the lower colon of Chinese cinema. I'm going to give you a clue to the end of the film now, so if you're still planning to see it (poor sucker) look away now.Apparently the emperor is just a misunderstood guy. I mean, he's raped, pillaged and slaughtered his way across Asia for one reason: to unite China, to end war (presumably because anyone who didn't agree with him is dead). To this the nameless one replies 'oh yeah, I guess you're really a nice guy then', and makes to leave. Some reviewers have said that Yimou doesn't comment on this explanation or decision. If this is so why does the director choose to end his film with a cut to the Great Wall of China, with a nauseatingly jingoistic caption underneath saying 'Our Land'? So that's all right then. Hitler? Misunderstood Euro-federalist. Stalin? Cuddly people-hugger. Rape of Nanking? Chinese just didn't understand what was good for them. See what I mean by 'rather they hadn't bothered'.To compare this monstrosity to Crouching Tiger is like whizzing on a Picasso (to quote Mike Myers). Watch Springtime in a Small Town or Twilight Samurai. For goodness sake, watch anything but this. If W made a movie about early America, it would echo Hero. I can think of no greater criticism. 3/10 (if that).",1,26,53,14 December 2004
Children of Men," More of a mystopia really
","You certainly have to credit Children of Men with originality. Rooting a dystopian vision in a real life social or political problem is just so passé.Apparently by 2027 women can't conceive anymore (isn't that always the way). Women have destroyed the world again; when will they ever learn? Civilisation has, predictably, broken down. The world beyond the English Channel has descended into howling, woad-smeared anarchy. Oh, and the government is evil because it doesn't like refugees.The problem with Children of Men is that it seems to have been assembled backwards. Most dystopias start with a topical problem or issue they want to explore and then build up to an extreme conclusion. Orwell and Bradbury had totalitarianism; Huxley and Burgess had social dislocation; Atwood had chauvinism; Niccol had genetic enhancement. Children of Men, though, appears to have begun with its funky dystopian backcloth and then realised half way through that it didn't actually have anything to say. Thus we have to listen with increasing impatience to all this guff about hating 'fugees (this caused me a momentary confusion: 'don't like The Fugees? So what, I mean, who does?') Now don't get me wrong, I'm a liberal kind of guy; I like immigration (as I discovered the disconcertingly confusing contraction of refugees to mean). But this Salford Poly, bed-sit politics is a bit preposterous in a post-apocalyptic society don't you think? Somehow, I don't think Neil Pye from the Young Ones would have survived the post-infertility thought police holocaust. Just guessing.What Children of Men does, it does quite well. It develops atmosphere and pace well and there are some good performances (particularly Clive Owen and Michael Caine) to set against the slightly hammy performances of the NUS fish warriors (I'm not kidding). But in the end it is impossible to escape from the infuriating, TV-shaking pointlessness of it all. Fecundity problem? For Pandas, yes. Are we Pandas? Government doesn't want to turn Britain into a hostel for the entire population of the world? How could they not; what would the Guardian say?",5,7,11,2 March 2007
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Tasteless and tedious - a real let down
","Fade inClankity clank, bang, bang, bang, swear, clank, ping, swear, twirl, swizzle, swear, pan in slow motion, clank, clank, clankity clank, clang, bang, frown, swear, bang, bang, BOOM! (Funky music with opening credits) Clankity clank, bang, bang, bang, swear, clank, ping, swear, twirl, swizzle, swear, pan in slow motion, clank, clank, clankity clank, clang, bang, frown, swear, bang, bang, BOOM, swear, swear, stare moodily into the distance, clang, band BOOM! Repeat repeat repeat repeat Fade out.And that, ladies and gentlemen, is it. To say that the Kill Bill lacks depth is a bit like saying that dogs lack table manners or the primordial swamp lacks a good opera company. To say that it's a bit tasteless and tacky is a bit like saying Californians need to sit voting exams.I fear Kill Bill proves only two things. Never assume that just because a man has made three great films he is not capable of something as crass as this. Secondly, never, ever listen to Uma Thurman when she says she has a great idea for a film. 3/10",3,18,33,2 February 2005
Saw," Great horror, but is ultimately lacking in purpose
","Considering it is by some margin the best contribution to American horror since Se7en, Saw is a strangely unengaging film.It is certainly slick enough. Throwing you right into the action you awake, along with the lead character (Adam) in a Fincher-esque, dingy underground bathroom/dungeon. You soon find Adam is not alone. Across the room another is another man. Both are chained by the ankle, taken by the mysterious jigsaw killer. The room contains a dead body, a gun and two saws. To survive, one of the men must kill the other by 6pm. If not, both die. Problem is, the saws won't cut the chains. To make it out, you must not only be prepared to kill; you also have to saw off your own footNice.Don't get me wrong, there are some good, if not terribly subtle, twists in the film; told mainly through the flashbacks of Adam's fellow captive, Lawrence. And the film has one or two moments that will be relished by the gore-fest lovers. There is some pretty good acting here too, especially from Leigh Whannell (Adam) and Danny Glover (Detective Tapp).The problem mainly lies in the fact that the film is such an obvious homage to Se7en - many of stylistic devices very reminiscent of the Fincher film  without any of the substance. Fincher manages the neat trick of wallowing in the murky side of the human psyche while appearing appalled by it as well. Saw just seems to revel in the brutality. If you're expecting moments that force the audience to be introspective, you won't find them here. Saw just isn't interested in discussing apathy, or greed or even the value of life that the killer talks about. The jigsaw killer is just another sick f*ck, complete with Thomas Harris name, eerie doll, dank warehouse apartment and kitsch slasher movie hang-outs (like subterranean car parks).All this leaves the film feeling a bit devoid of purpose. In style very much life Se7en, in execution, more like Friday 13th. Which is a shame, because there really is much to enjoy here if you're a fan of the red stuff. 6/10",6,5,9,3 March 2005
Titanic," Glug...glug...glug...thunk.
","Just outside Kursk on a sunny July morning in 1943 Obersturmführer Muller of the 3rd Panzer Division has a problem. His fancy new Panther tank, in a Meisterstück of environmentally sound engineering, has come with a two live zebra painfully welded to the rear and, as we know, Germans don't do back wheel drive. Vorsprung Durk Technic.A similar, and no less surreal, problem plagues James Cameron's technical tour de force. It is impressive, groundbreaking and sophisticated but, let's face it, it's going nowhere with a plot like that bolted incongruously to its chassis.Renowned to be one of the most expensive films of all time; it seems preposterous that a few quid couldn't have been siphoned from the 'huge-ship-sinks-dramatically' budget into the 'story' budget. But there you go.The actors try their best. Plaudits go Leonardo DiCaprio for successfully rehashing Hollywood's cheesy Iorish stereotypes. Billy Zane is excellent as the 'creepy, violent one'. And, of course, our Kate furthers the plot significantly by putting her famous waps on display (they are very impressive).In fact the plot is so bad, and the dialogue so awful, you can sense the huge directorial sigh of relief when the ship starts to sink. Listen carefully and you can almost hear Cameron mutter over tortured screech of ice on metal, 'Ah! This is the kinda film I understand.' Once the ship goes belly-up things do, indeed, liven up dramatically. Things slide around, people scream, chandeliers crash, vast imponderable drops open beneath peoples' legs and the huge, hulking edifice that is James Cameron's Titanic sinks gracefully and inexorably into the dark waters.At least an hour and forty minutes before all this, Winslet provides one of the more amusing, unintentional ironies of the film, when she declares to the ship's designer 'Mr Freud has some interesting theories about men forever striving to make things bigger'. Biggest ship, biggest movie, biggest budget. Hmmm, save it for Oprah.So impressive, expensive, huge and groundbreaking. Nevertheless, Titanic remains a towering cathedral to mediocrity - and the only film for which the best viewing experience is achieved by arriving two-and-a-half hours late and leaving ten minutes before the end. 4/10.",4,18,37,21 December 2004
Mr. & Mrs. Smith," Hard not to like
","Mr & Mrs Smith fails to work  or, in fact, add up  on so many levels. Probably the most trying suspension of disbelief required is the notion that two chronically paranoid assassins take a whole 5 or 6 years to figure out that they're sleeping under the same roof. Or, from a crude perspective, that it takes Brad 4 or 5 years to put Angelina's lips to work on anything more saucy than a peck on the cheek. Yeah right! But none of that matters. No, really, listen to me, it doesn't. Because dwelling on such trivial matters as plot flaws, character inconsistencies, continuity problems and the like, you might fail to appreciate the majestic, hilarious nonsense of it all. Which would be a shame, really, as that's the whole point.Think of it this way: Mr & Mrs Smith is Day of the Jackal meets Pirates of the Caribbean. It's bonkers (it would appear this is both literally and figuratively true). Leave all cerebral engagement, rumination and cogitation for later (it will only get in the way); lie back and think of Angelina - or Brad  or both - depending on your proclivity and/or stamina.Mr & Mrs Smith is saved from the Chris de Burg Award for Hollywood Mediocrity by two critical factors, neither of which alone would have been enough to save it.The first is the extraordinary chemistry between two fine actors. There is a point early in the film where Angelina, who is wrapped in a sheet with a flower in her hair, approaches Brad after a night of well, you get the idea. Brad looks at her with what one might generously describe as raw, naked lust. It was a look that could have impregnated the unprotected from 30 paces. Someone really needs to bottle that and give it to Orlando Bloom. Anyway, I digress. What this does for the film is help you overlook some of the knottier problems with the characterisation  like that fact that these two are, presumably, not very nice: y'know, the whole assassin, killing-people-for-money thing. To take another example, the whole Brad-cheerfully-and-repeatedly-kicking-his-wife-in-the-stomach (albeit off camera) thing.The second saving grace is the dialogue. Fractious couples have been done comedically before, of course. But the counterpoint of marital strife and cold-blooded psychopathy has probably never been so funny. Think of the car chase in the Terminator, then think of it being used to relay two back stories not one. Then imagine it being played for laughs. It works, it really does. It's a skill.There are some really deft touches too. Watch out for the lift sequence, and following dinner engagement. Watch out, also for the nice little reference to Butch Cassidy & the Sundance Kid at the end. It's worth remembering that the director was also responsible for a real spy movie  The Bourne Identity, so he knows what he's doing on that score. And definitely watch out for an hilarious turn from Vince Vaughan  now there's a man who knows how to spot an opening! Is this film high art? Erm no. Is it extremely difficult not to like? Yes it is. It's genuinely entertaining, and there has to be a place in cinema for that.",7,2,6,4 July 2006
The Departed," Not really a Scorsese film
","The title above is nonsense, of course, as it clearly is a Scorsese film, both in tone and style. The problem, though, is it ought not to be.For those who haven't seen Infernal Affairs  the film on which The Departed is based - the plot revolves around two men. An undercover cop, infiltrating a mob gang in Boston (DiCaprio) and an undercover mobster (Damon), who has infiltrated the police force at the arrangement of the appallingly psychotic Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson).Frenetic action ensues as the two warring tribes tear each other apart in order to find their respective moles. Meanwhile, both undercover men are struggling with their identity. But which one will crack first? Taking aside the remake issue for a moment, does the film work on its own terms? Partially. The story is excellent and involving, and while it is a long film at nearly 2hours 30min, it keeps you on the edge of your seat throughout. The characters are very well drawn, and there is clear movement in both characters, which helps to engage the audience. Leonardo DiCaprio is truly excellent as Billy Costigan, the mole for the Boston Police Department; and a special mention must also go to Mark Wahlberg, who manages to steal just about every scene he's in.However, despite these notable strengths, I completely failed to leave the cinema feeling wowed. Entertained, with out a doubt, but this is a long way from being Scorsese's best work.Part of the problem is the juxtaposition of violence and humour. While being an excellent director in almost every respect, Scorsese is no Tarantino when it comes to violence and humour. The humour worked fine on its own terms (Wahlberg, in particular, was hilarious) but it was used in a clunky way, and disrupted the mood and the pace of the film.Another problem was Jack Nicholson's Frank Costello. Jack is unleashed in The Departed  and not in a good way. He seems to think he's playing The Joker again. I'm not quite sure what either Nicholson or Scorsese though they were doing with all those rat imitations. In these circumstances, the insanity of the mobster would normally intimidate the other characters  and the audience (c.f. Mr Blonde in The Reservoir Dogs). Here, either the chemistry between Leo and Jack was wrong; or the scene was badly written or performed (I suspect the later). It just didn't work.So to the remake issue. In many respects, The Departed is a photographic negative of Infernal Affairs, which suffered from poor characterisation, but had spectacularly slick plotting, and a coherent tone.It would be wrong to expect a remake to mimic the style of the original. But in this case, where style and substance are so inextricably fused in the original, it can be dangerous to mess with it.Unfortunately, Infernal Affairs had Michael Mann written all over it. It needed a highly stylised treatment and, dare I say it, California. Something just doesn't ring true in The Departed. It was a good film, but something was just wrong.",7,1,4,3 August 2007
Signs," Mad Mel's Mrs DiesAgain! (This is not a spoiler)
","You know, you'd have to be seriously worried if you were Mel's wife in film. Black men in 1970s action flicks have a more tenacious grip on life. At least they generally cark it at the end of the film, gallantly laying down their lives when victory is at hand so the goody-goody white boy can ride off into the white-only sunset with a tasty bit of crumpet.Mel's wives/girlfriends/love interests rarely make it past the opening credits.Yep, Mad Mel has lost his Mrs and is mean as hell. But this time its god he's p* ssed with. Can even Mad Mel mess with the messiah? Sure he can.Oh, and there are some aliens as well Ho Hum.Signs is the third of the almost invariably enjoyable M Night Shyamalan films. It is a long way from being his best.This is not, as many have said, because the film contains little in the way of 'twist'. Last time I checked, many great films had no twist at all and were still great. And Shyamalan's style is far more dependent on building suspense than pulling an unusually coloured rabbit out of the hat at the end of the last real. But such is the joy of Hollywood. Make one film with a great twist, and be forced to repeat it.Shyamalan once again does a great job with suspense. Once again, family is integral to the plot. But the real core of this film is faith. Mel, you see, has a dead Mrs, and he knows who's responsible. Apparently, it's none other than god. Phwewee, somebody's gonna get hurt. Reeeal Bad! Okay, this is mildly diverting for a while. Mystic Mel does a pretty good job of the whole 'I'm not wasting another moment of my life on prayer' thing. Possibly the pain of him having to say these lines happily coincided with the pain of the character. Or am I being cynical? Mel can certainly act when he can be bothered, as he frequently showed  sometime south of 1986.The supporting cast is also superb. Joachim Phoenix is excellent, as are the two kids. Cherry Jones does an excellent job as the benevolent, Fargo-esquire local copper shorn of all the Coenisms.There was some great comedy. Mel walking into his living room to find Joachim and the two kids on the sofa with two boxes of bacofoil on their heads was a fantastic touch. And, dare I say it, Mel's personal leitmotif  the untimely demise of his better half  left a genuine lump in my throat.But there are two fundamental problems with the film.The first is the aliens. They just get in the way. Okay, they provide the basis for the suspense. Okay, there are some interesting parallels to be drawn between faith in god and the nutters out looking for aliens in prairie country. And I suppose the fact that the nutters are right in Signs adds some significance to Mel's own character development. But I can't help thinking that it is attempting to juxtapose the essentially frivolous with the deadly serious - and not very well  The Village does it much better. So, in M Night's film the nutters are right. But we all know (don't we?) that in reality, they're just nutters. So is it an apt metaphor or just all hogwash? The second problem is the finale. I'm biased possibly but to me it just didn't make sense. 'The Lord Giveth and the Lord Taketh Away  seemingly on the basis of his own personal whimsy'. I'm not convinced that this is a good basis for the massive character shift undergone by Melvine the Terrible, and you're left with the conclusion that either he's not a very clear thinker at all, or he's been throwing a rather childish tantrum for most of the rest of the film. Neither lend the script credibility.Watch the Village is my recommendation. It's a massively under-estimated film (possibly Shyamalan's best). In many respects it is a half-remake of Signs, and is somehow less trite.A minor work of a very good filmmaker. 6/10.",6,4,8,13 October 2006
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," An insult to everyone's intelligence
","The best film ever made, period! Allow me to take a contrary view. Not the best film ever made (Les Enfants du Paradis, The Godfather, The Bicycle Thief). Not the best science fiction film (2001, Bladerunner, Gattaca, Code 46) Not even the best film about periods (Carrie).Star Wars brought two things to the audience for the first time; decent sound and visual production and mass marketed toy tie-ins. The first is laudable; the second is where you suspect George Lucus' real talent lies.Like most adults in their early thirties, I got my first taste of Star Wars when I was too young to know better. We were too poor to afford the cinema then, so I watched it on the small screen and still liked it. But now I know better. Star Wars contains some of the hammiest, crummiest dialogue ever uttered by respectable actors. 'Feel the force, Luke!' Yeah, whatever. If that wasn't enough, Lucas then went back and mucked up that tiny amount character consistency which made it out of the first cut.Star Wars, made at the height of the Cold War and the nadir of American foreign policy, is the good ole story of good ole America spreading its good ole values against a dark, satanic empire. Sound familiar? It's also the story of a poor orphan boy who runs away, rescues a beautiful princess and saves a kingdom from an oppressive tyranny. Sound familiar? Oh yes, and on the way he meets an old man with strange powers, an untrustworthy adventurer and a band of rebels hiding in a forest. Sound familiar? Of course, there is a reason for this. A simple reason. A long time ago in, well, America, Mr Lucas picked up a copy of Campbell's A Hero with a Thousand Faces. This book outlines the fact that all stories have a core of elements in common. Indeed, at a plot level, most stories are essentially the same. Excellent, thinks Lucas, that means I can legitimately rip off better films like the Hidden Fortress and the Dam Busters, better stories like Hamlet and Robin Hood and bastardise Buddhism and Confucianism into the bargain. No need for any original thought whatever, in fact.And thus it was to prove. From the ghostly mentor to the father bearing a terrible secret, Star Wars rehearses every conceivable cinematic (and indeed sub-literary) cliché. Along the way, it inflicts upon us some truly awful dialogue and a paper-thin plot.But these are not the biggest crimes of the film. The worst is that Lucas did not even copy effectively. He forgets, for example, that perfect characters are uninteresting. Mark Hamill may be a fine actor, but his goody-goody clean-cut character grates after just a few minutes of screen time. Harrison Ford fares rather better as Han Solo  so why does Lucas go back and make him fire second in the space bar? It's not just petty, it's puerile.Possibly I should relax, hang loose, go with the flow and not get so uptight. But I just can't help getting irritated. Star Wars is puerile nonsense of the worst kind. The best you can say of it is that it brings the McDonalds experience into the cinema. The worst it is a borderline insult to everyone's intelligence.",3,13,34,10 March 2005
