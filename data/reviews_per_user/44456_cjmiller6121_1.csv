Skyfall," superbly disappointed
","i was incredibly disappointed with Skyfall. the plot felt weak as there where way to many plot holes. i hate the 'hacker magic' that some movies bring. yes it's a neat element but in this movie it went way to far. too many times i felt bored, checking my watch and it was hard for me to believe this was a bond film. some aspects i did like: the scene where n meets q and he reveals his true appearance haunted me and made me squirm in my seat. the scene where you hear the English rock coming from a speaker and find out its a helicopter added a great fear element to make this one of the best siege scenes i've ever seen. i liked q as a villain and his performance and those two scenes made this a solid 5 for me",5,4,5,17 March 2015
