The Ring," Far From Scary
","Lots of people had been hyping this and I was excited and anxious to rent it to see what all of the fuss was about and when I finally got to rent it (this was one or two years ago, I believe) I was expecting The Exorcist level of scary because that's what lots of people I knew had been hyping it to be.Wow, I sure was surprised! I found it far from scary! It's OK/decent movie wise but as far as horror movies go I think I'd rank this more as mystery but I didn't find it scary one bit.Maybe it's because I had seen the commercials for Scary Movie 3 parodying it...I dunno but I didn't find it scary one bit.I think it'll be awhile before we see an actual scary (good) horror movie (an original one too...not an imported remake from Asia or a crappy remake that butchers an original from the 1970s!) Though, maybe I'm pushing a bit...a horror movie that's actually scary and good would be real nice. (For a change!)",7,1,2,4 February 2005
Monster," Very Good Yet Very Disturbing
","This is a very good movie. Charlize deserved that Oscar in my opinion.It's a very good movie but again, very disturbing.It's so sad and too bad that Aileen didn't get the help she deserved and needed.I can see why people feel bad for her and I guess I do too because it's so sad to see a person deteriorate like that and after being abused her whole life to suffer like she did and to come to killing all of those men.Her mind was just set to that all men are equal to that rapist.I gave it a 9 out of 10 (a 9 only because the rape and murder scenes were disturbing.)",9,0,2,22 January 2005
Spider-Man 2," Awesome!!!
","I loved both Spider Man and Spiderman 2!Spider Man 2 was definitely worth the wait!It was action packed, it was just great!Great performances by all of the actors in this movie!But watch the Spider Man before you go out and see Spider Man 2, you'll be confused and asking others questions after the movie (much like my grandfather did because he hasn't seen Spider Man yet! =P But that's OK...)I gave it 10 out of 10!!!I highly recommend it!",10,3,3,17 August 2004
Lost in Translation," It Was Good
","I love Scarlett Johansson...she's so beautiful and talented and that was my main reason for seeing this.I liked it. I enjoyed it...the story was original (I guess you can say.) It kept me interested and it was just a cool movie.That's all I can really say about it.I recommend it, it was a good movie and I'm happy to see Scarlett going up there to Hollywood's A-list status, she deserves it! If you're at Blockbuster and want a good movie to rent, rent this. It's funny at time (I thought it was. When Bob was talking to the elderly Japanese woman and when he couldn't understand the Japanese people when they talked to him...and the hooker, was that what she was supposed to be? And that little skit that she pulled...I thought it was weird but amusing...didn't really get what that was supposed to be or about.) I love Scarlett! 10/10",10,1,2,18 February 2005
Corpse Bride," Good But Has It's Flaws...
","I say I'd give The Corpse Bride a 7 out of 10.The animation is beautiful but the script is only half assed done.The film runs at an underwhelming 76 minutes, the maggot looks like an inch worm, and I couldn't understand what they were saying in some of the songs.I did laugh at parts of it and I did like it but I felt it could've been much, much better.With that being said Burton still better win the Oscar for Best Animated Feature come Oscar time.Not for the quality of this particular film but for him NEVER being nominated on any of his other amazing films (especially The Nightmare Before Christmas.) I'm sure the rabid fan boys/girls/persons that live in Hot Topic will be all over this review for not giving it 10 stars (they had merchandise for this movie weeks before it was even out!) I say wait until it comes out to video. Paying the $7.25 for a film that's just over a little an hour long and not all that great to boot is barely worth the admission.7/10",7,0,0,26 September 2005
The Exorcist," Probably one of the most powerful movies ever.
","The Exorcist is probably one of the most powerful movies ever.It's right up there with the best of the best.I gave it 10 stars. All of these sequels and prequels will never beat the original.Besides--why make sequels?There is nothing that will happen in the sequels that didn't happen in the first movie--a person get possessed then they get an exorcism performed on them.But my point is, is that The Exorcist is one of the scariest movies I've ever seen, and I'm sure the same for many others too.",10,0,2,3 September 2003
"Good Night, and Good Luck."," See This Movie
","I saw Good Night And Good Luck today along with a packed stadium seated theater.I had no idea who the McCarthy guy was or the whole deal that went on with him and his quest for communists in the US so this film was very informative and interesting.For those, like me, who don't know who he is or what the film is about (well I had an idea of what the plot was) it's about a senator Joe McCarthy who is trying to weed out the supposed communists in the country while also terrorizing innocent citizens and a news team at CBS who exposed what he was doing.Like I said the film was very informative and interesting. Great direction by George Clooney, great acting by all, amazing cinematography, sound, makeup, and costumes. I hope those big shots at the Academy award this film in all of those departments come Oscar time! Just a little thing I thought that was kind of funny was how they allowed the news anchor to smoke while on TV, had the tobacco companies sponsor them, and how everyone in the news department chain smoked. My, my, how times have changed! I was happy to see MADtv's Alex Borstein play the part of secretary/assistant Natalie (at least someone from that show is doing noteworthy projects after they leave!) She fits right into 1950s period pieces in my opinion.I enjoyed the film but thought it moved at a bit of a snail's pace at some parts which is why I took off 2 points.8/10",7,5,12,8 October 2005
Rosemary's Baby," A Classic!
","This is probably the best horror movie there is!If you're looking for blood and gore or sex (well this has two of those scenes...lol) but if you're looking for the run of the mill Friday The 13th -type movie steer clear from this one, this one is actually good and intelligent.This movie has a different type of scary, not like blood and gore, 'oh no! here comes the masked killer!' scary it's an eerie type of fear and paranoia.If you've seen this movie and didn't find it scary, watch it again and think to yourself 'what if that was me?' you surely wouldn't wanna be living next to a bunch of satanic weirdos (at least I wouldn't!)I'd recommend it to you, but like my friends or something...no way.Because if I recommend this to my friends I'm sure they'd expect the blood and gore type stuff but Rosemary's Baby is intelligent and like I said has a paranoia and different kind of fear.Anyways I give Rosemary's Baby 10/10! I love this movie!",10,0,2,31 July 2004
Halloween," One Of The Best!
","Halloween is one of the best horror movies made, probably the best slasher film ever made.This is the one that paved the way for all other slasher films being the first slasher film (at least the only one credited to be it.)This is one of my favorite horror movies!It's does a good job spooking, scaring and making you jump (at least it did for me...)The killer Michael Myers is so scary looking (which is why it makes Halloween one of my top favorite horror movies and the most scariest to me!)I sure would hate to bump into him on Halloween!If you're looking for a good scare definetley buy this or rent it! It'll be worth your time and money!Steer clear from the sequels, though.The only sequel that was actually good and lived up to the original Halloween is Halloween: H2O. (That would have been a great ending to a not so great series, but oh well all the movie people care about it the $$$!)I give Halloween 4 out of 4 stars!!! 10 out of 10 stars(for IMDB's rating system!!!)",10,0,1,31 July 2004
A Nightmare on Elm Street," One Of The Last Original And Actually Scary Horror Movies!
","A Nightmare On Elm Street is one of the last horror movies that is actually scary and original that comes to my mind.When I first saw it I thought it was really scary (I still do, but I have it on DVD and have watched it probably over 12 times so it's not as scary as that first time.)The fear is different because this time he's killing you in your dreams, while you're asleep so there's no help unless you wake yourself up but what about the next time you fall asleep?!Freddy's face and his whole presence is scary.Like I said, I think this is one of the last horror movies that was actually original AND scary.If you haven't seen A Nightmare On Elm Street yet then go out and rent it!",Null,0,0,11 November 2004
Sin City," More Than Just All Eye Candy...
","I saw this today and it's the first ever R rated movie I've seen in theaters and that I've snuck into. (Just felt like putting that in here.)The movie has beautiful visual effects. The cinematography was original and great, the sound score was great too, as was the stellar big name cast, and the plot was a good one but it seemed to get stretched out at the end in my opinion.The big name cast drew me in when I first saw the promos for it, I figured it must be at least decent if it has that many big name actors and the cinematography from the promos also drew me in to want to see this. I liked how the cinematography was mostly black and white but would have such lively, bright colors. The blood being assorted colors was cool too.The acting is great (for the most part) but I thought Brittany Murphy's and that other actor's who was in her segment with her (didn't recognize him) their acting could've been a bit better I thought.I especially liked how all of the ladies of O Town ruled the streets especially Miho with her swords and spears and Gail and those guns (hah, no pun intended!) I thought towards the end it got a bit stretched out but the more I think about it I really enjoyed it and I'm so tempted to go out and see it 5 times again!A must see! It's probably a definite that it'll become a classic! Great, original cinematography, amazing all star cast, and amazing plot! This'll be one that people will be talking about for years to come!Though I thought the ending got stretched out I'm going to give this a 10 just because the more I think about it the more I love it and the more I want to see it again and again!10/10",10,0,2,2 April 2005
