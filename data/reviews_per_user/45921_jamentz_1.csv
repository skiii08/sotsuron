Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Kiddie-trash almost redeemed by a single scene
","When I left the theater after seeing this movie, I told a friend that I would watch it again just for the fight scene between the two Jedis and Darth Maul at the end.Now that I've had time to think about it, I would say that's not true. While that scene was brilliantly done, it was interrupted periodically by the goings-on with Anikin and Jar-Jar. Those goings-on were quite possibly the most ridiculous grand finale ever filmed. The whole movie suffered from this syndrome: brilliance interrupted by obvious coddling to the lowest common denominator.George Lucas has justified the slapstick slant and lack of characterization to his desire to make this movie accessible to children. I doubt he even believes that himself. This movie has a pathetic story, unmemorable characters (with the exception of Ray Park's Darth Maul), and puerile humor that simply isn't funny.Despite all this, Lucas is raking in the dough. I'm sure that's all he really wanted.",4,0,1,8 July 1999
