The Ring," A great suspense movie!
","The Ring was a cleverly made movie. The story is about a videotape that kills you in 7 days after you watch it. One of the things I like about this movie is that it is not extremely violent. It does not contain sex scenes, extreme gore, and I can't remember any cursing. Most horror movies contain all these things when it is completely unnecessary. I am not Mr. Ultra Conservative, but I find a movie more creative when you don't have to fill it up with such things. I watched this movie with a friend on a big screen TV in DTS. There were definitely several scenes that made me jump and that hasn't happened in a LONG time! The only reason I docked the movie 2 stars was because it was a bit slow and there wasn't quite enough 'jumpy' scenes. Aside from that, a great movie to watch alone or with a good friend in the dark. I hope the sequel is just as good or better!",8,0,1,3 April 2005
The Others," Excellent suspense movie!
","The Others is an outstanding suspense movie. This is one of, if not the best role, I have ever seen Nicole Kidman (Grace) perform in. I enjoy a movie that does not need to be done up in special effects or filled with cursing and nudity. You will not find any of this in this particular movie. Grace lives in a secluded mansion with her two children. Her husband went off to war and never returned. One day, three strangers appear at the doorstep of Grace's house. She hires them as servants and then strange things start to happen. The movie has some great scenes which scared the pants off of me! There are many twists in the movie which add a nice flavor to it. Just when I thought I had it all figured out, nope! Another surprise. If you enjoy a good suspense flick and if you are into guessing 'what's going to happen next', definitely watch this film. I can't stress enough how much I enjoyed it.",10,1,2,3 April 2005
