Iron Man 3," Unexpected
","Iron Man 3 is a totally unexpected, intriguing, beguiling and ironic film.It is a very good flick. However, it is not a very good Iron Man movie. It succeeds as a movie. It has heart, very interesting heroes, great love interest, sadistic and compelling bad guys, great action sequences, and interesting misdirection.Unfortunately, as an Iron Man movie, it fails. Iron Man, as the name denotes, is a man inside an iron suite. Unfortunately in this movie, the man is mostly out of the suit and he is simply remote controlling them, in which case, they should have renamed this movie as Remote Man. Don't get me wrong, remote controlled suit is an interesting innovation but they are used far too much of it, that it became boring. I could and might accept that a remote suit greeted Piper in the first part of the movie, but I don't get why the airplane save was not done by Iron Man himself. As for the suits, they are not that great or interesting. I totally hated the fact that they disintegrate very easily, unlike the suits in the other movies. Which led me to believe that the actual Mandarin is not the Mandarin or Aldrich Killian but the suits themselves, as in they are cheap Chinese knock-offs. Shane Black is a great director, I am a fan, and still am, but I really do believe that he should have stayed clear from this movie. It is apparent that he is not an Iron Man fan. One reason The Avengers was greatly appreciated by countless of fans is because Joss Whedon is not only a great director/writer, he also appreciated the source material itself, which apparently Shane Black didn't.I rate this movie 7/10.",Null,0,3,28 April 2013
