50 First Dates," This Movie Broke My Heart
","Warning guys: this near tear-jerker is not your typical chick flick.I was pleasantly surprised by this powerful romantic dramatic comedy which shows the real meaning of true love without the triteness of the modern movie age. It's shallow title lulls you into expecting the typical silly chick flick motif. You're deceived into relaxing and expecting the same formula, but midway through you realized this is one of those rare movies that does what it's intended to do: move you. This movie has genuine emotion. You'll turn the DVD player off with a lump in your throat.It's silly comedic movements (read: Rob Schneider) distracts from the emotion of the film, but Adam Sandler and Drew Berrymore's surprising performances more than makes up for it. Adam finds an environment where his natural wit moves well with the movie, and Drew's shy innocence shines throughout.Don't be deceived---give it a chance and remember what it feels like to fall in love again for the first time.Pros: The best movie Adam Sandler ever made (ordinarily this isn't saying much, but this really is a great movie) and the most memorable romantic comedy of this decade.Cons: This could also translate as a great family film but for the unnecessary PG-13 materials which adds nothing to the film.Conclusion: A surprising heart-breaker you'll find yourself embarrassingly recommending to your friends.",10,1,2,29 October 2006
