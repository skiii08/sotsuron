Blade Runner 2049," Great movie! Must see
","Let me start by saying that I am NOT a sci-fi fan... But this movie is awesome! Special effects, director, cinematography and ALL the actors in all the roles! Jared Leto (one of my fav actors AND musicians :)) is perfectly creepy in his role... Ryan G. perfect choice and his acting is spot-on, almost human! :)I will now go back and watch the original again (30 years is a long time!) - but this is a great movie sequel or not! :)",8,1,8,15 October 2017
A Star Is Born," Amazing feat by Bradley Cooper
","Great great movie ... it may not be a '10' compared to other masterpieces... but it deserves a 10 for the amazing preparation and love that has been put into this movie ... the directing, acting, singing, study and much more that Bradley Cooper has put into this film is fantastic ... Lady Gaga is a natural actress and surely he brought out the best of her.
Every actor is great and in the right role. The music fantastic. Movie to remember for a long time to come ...",10,2,4,17 February 2019
Bohemian Rhapsody," Epic movie
","Great movie with majestic acting by Rami Malek. People must remember this is a movie, not a documentary ! Therefore some things and/or dates are not completely correct but needed to get it flowing... so enjoy it as it is and then go back to rediscover all the documentaries about this fantastic band and the amazing Freddy!",9,2,4,17 February 2019
Beauty and the Beast," Worth watching!
","Cannot understand the 'haters' that gave this title horrible reviews here... It is not a masterpiece but it is NOT as bad as some rate it!
Casting is really good, as are the acting, singing and special effects. Let's remember it is a fairytale so it is fine to still look and feel like that.
Loved the 'progress' of the 'glance' into LeFou's gayness (I was at first disappointed when he was dancing with a woman during the ball scene! :) and the mixed couples. Enjoyable for both kids and adults.
Well done Disney! We cannot be stuck in seventeen hundreds either in a story or in a constitution ... ;)",7,0,1,24 December 2017
Black Panther," Seriously... what's all the fuss about?!
","Yes it is an entertaining movie... but one viewing is enough (way too long...) and don't understand what's all the hype about it and the crazy cash it grossed!
Sign of the times and the fight against the Orange Man and rampant racism. But so much more better movies out there...",6,9,15,25 February 2019
