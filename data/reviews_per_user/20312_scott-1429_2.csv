The Benchwarmers," Boogers, Farts, and minimal laughs
","My wife and I wanted to go see X-Men 3, the kids wanted 'Benchwarmers'. The kids won out and the whole family lost on this one. I like Rob Schneider, Jon Lovitz, and the rest of the cast, and admittedly laughed out loud early on, encouraged by how the movie started out. But cliché' after cliché' set in, mired down in unfunny slapstick, until even my 13 year old son said it was lame.The whole premise is weak to begin with, and at one point I turned to my wife and said 'This is just Dodgeball all over again.' The big difference? 'Dodgeball' was at least mostly entertaining. 'Benchwarmers' has a heartless, mindless script, despite appearing to be full of heart for the nerds, geeks and losers of the world, but it's painfully evident it's merely empty words on the screen. Rob Schneider's 'big revelation' is no big revelation at all, and the characters are all, for the most part, bad caricatures.Scene after scene after scene has you groaning over how predictable, unrealistic, and just-not-funny they are. Sorry Hollywood, but grown guys driving down the street hitting mailboxes with a baseball just isn't very funny. Nor is the tired, old wisecracking robot (poorly done at that).As the movie thankfully neared the end, my wife leaned over and said 'I just want this to END!' I was in total agreement and could not even recommend this one as a rental.",2,0,1,30 May 2006
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," Special Effects: 10, Storyline: 2
","I am a HUGE fan of both Depp and the original Pirates. Naturally I went into this movie with a bit of skepticism as I do with ANY sequel. My daughter (15) had seen it twice and raved about it. So my 13 year old son and I went today. As we walked out, he said EXACTLY what was going thru my head: 'I was kind of bored'. Me, too.Special effects do not a movie make any more. We've come to expect that. Something that NEVER changes, though, is the critical element of a strong plot, something that 'Dead Man's Chest' lacks. As near as my son and I could figure, the whole plot line was that everyone wanted Davy Jones' heart to control the seas. Yawn. The rest was a showcase for some admittedly fantastic special effects.Another gripe I had with this movie, as I do with many nowdays, is that the trend towards such utterly authentic dialogue almost makes much of the dialogue incomprehensible. Okay, maybe it's because I'm 'old' (51) and my hearing sucks. But the dialects used by Naomi Harris (Tia Dalma) as well as the usual cast of ragamuffin sailors, was often impossible to understand. I love the realism; I hate the fact that I missed so much of the dialogue.It's hard - almost impossible - for a sequel to live up to the expectations of an original. Only a very few ('Aliens' for example) can come close or achieve it. In my opinion, and my son's, 'Dead Man's Chest' fell a bit short. Am I glad I saw it? Absolutely. I was moderately entertained. Would I see it again or buy it on DVD? Absolutely not.",6,2,3,22 July 2006
