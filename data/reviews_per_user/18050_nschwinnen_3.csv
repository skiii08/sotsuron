50 First Dates," Not a good film
","The premise of this movie is incredibly stupid. Henry Roth (Adam Sandler), who is afraid of commitment and constantly has one-night stands with beautiful tourists, suddenly falls in love at first sight with Lucy (Drew Barrymore). The problem is that Lucy has short-term memory loss and he has to wake up each day and re-convince her to fall in love with him. That's a pretty ridiculous scenario. That being said, I have no problem with the ridiculous plot-line. I pretty much expect it with an Adam Sandler movie. The problem with this movie is that its not funny enough to overcome to horrible plot. Normally, you accept the bad story line because all you really expect out of the movie is to laugh and enjoy it. With this movie, however, it seems like the creators wanted to make this like every other romantic comedy, where the love story is more important than the comedy. It just doesn't work in this case because its just not believable to think that these two characters would ever live happily ever after. There are some funny parts in the movie, but overall not enough to keep me interested throughout the film.",2,4,9,1 August 2005
Wedding Crashers," Non-stop laughs
","This movie is one of the funniest I have seen in a long time. Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson are absolutely awesome together. You probably won't see this movie up for any Acadamy Awards, but you also probably won't see an actor perform better in a comedy than Vince Vaughn. He delivers his lines flawlessly and and really develops his character perfectly. Owen Wilson is a perfect complement and the rest of the cast does an awesome job as well. The movie is about 2 guys who crash weddings. They treat Wedding Season like an athlete would treat football season. They crash weddings to meet girls and have one-night stands without commitment. But forget about the plot because this movie is really about being hilarious. There is, of course, the obligatory love story and the ending is definitely satisfying, but by the time the ending gets there, you really won't care how it ends because you will have spent the previous 2 hours laughing so hard.",9,2,5,1 August 2005
The Silence of the Lambs," I hate this movie
",I really hate Silence of the Lambs.  Because I hate this movie so much I have come here to vent my frustrations.  This is the most overrated movie ever made and I am sorry that I wasted 2 hours of my life watching it.  I have not and will not see the sequels because the original is so terrible. The only award this movie should have been nominated for is 'Stupidest Movie of the Year.',1,9,56,2 January 2004
