Sucker Punch," Sucker Punch Film Analysis
","While it may be true that this film is a CGI extravaganza it is not true that the film functions on only one level, a visual feast it may be, but this is a work with more depth than you would initially think. Am I as a red blooded heterosexual male biased by the acres of female flesh and overtly sexual nature of the films premise, yes of course I am and the film makes no apology for being aimed squarely at a young male sci-fi oriented demographic. Those who have written this film off as just misogynistic titillation though, have poorly understood the complex interplay of concepts and propositions put forward in this film. The main proposition being that reality itself is all about perception, and if it feels as real to you as the real world does, then maybe given the right circumstances it's alright to choose the fantasy instead, and nowhere in the film is this proposition more salient than in the final scenes of the main character, Baby Doll (played by Emily Browning.) Of course ignoring what is going on around you completely is not beneficial to anyone but if the fantasy helps you deal with reality, in much the same way that a nervous stage actor might picture the audience naked, then you are using something you can deal with, to help you with something you cannot. Many after viewing the closing moments of the film will be disappointed by the finish, but they would do well to take note of some lyrics by Aerosmith 'Life's a journey not a destination' and so it is with this film, when you run away from monsters you escape them, but you take your fear with you, if you do not know how to fight back then you need to learn, and just like the philosophers of old, when you cause change without, you cause change within. It's not getting to the end that counts, its how you travelled.The accompanying soundtrack to this film serves a dual purpose, it does what a good soundtrack always does and underscores the emotional highs and lows of the main characters, but it also serves as a guide that in several instances in the film if not correctly interpreted will leave the viewer wondering what the hell is going on, for instance when the song 'Where is my mind' starts playing, you know that this means the protagonist is about to temporarily escape the unpleasant reality of the brothel, (this reality is itself a facade created by Baby Doll to protect her from the reality of the lunatic asylum) what is not so evident and something that many seem to have missed is the fact that this song, which is the backbone of the movie asks the question quite literally, not just where is my mind at the moment, but what is the mind. It might be something of a stretch to suggest that this film raises deep philosophical questions about the nature of the Ego but those who have not understood that it does at least tip it's metaphorical hat in the direction of Descartes (I think therefore I am) and his 'Wax Argument' have seen only the surface and will come away from this film feeling like they have watched something with no real storyline. The reality is that they have watched the film and only understood a small part of the story, the irony here is that this ultimately is what the film is trying to say, you might think you know what is going on, you might think this is about scantily clad girls who perform for the benefit of an almost exclusively male audience, but if that is what you think then you have only seen the first reality, and you unlike Baby Doll, have failed to escape, and that is the Sucker Punch that the title refers to. Because of the complex nature of this film many will not understand what they have seen and write it off as style over substance, but this film is almost certainly guaranteed to one day be considered a cult classic.And as to the questions, what is the mind and what is reality? Maybe, they are the same thing.... You decide.",10,4,7,12 April 2011
Thor," Film Review For Thor (2011)
","Film Review For Thor (2011)What is it about comic book adaptation's that so divides people? This is one of those films that people seem to either love or hate. I get the feeling that the people who hate this film would hate the comics as well, so the question then becomes, who do you listen to when reading the reviews? Should this film be judged on its merits as a film that stands independently from the comic, or should it be judged on whether it is a good adaptation?I will come right out and say that I think it is an excellent adaptation of the comic. It is worth bearing in mind for anyone who has even a passing familiarity with Norse mythology, that the Marvel Thor is based fairly loosely on the original myths. Norse mythology is at its heart very dark and more than a little depressing, unlike the gods of most other cultures there is no happy ending. In the final confrontation with the giants (Ragnarok) most of the gods are killed, including Thor, who after battling and defeating the Midgard serpent takes nine steps and dies from the effects of the serpent's poison, this film being based on the Marvel comic's character is decidedly lighter in tone than that. Kenneth Branagh has in my opinion given a film that could have just been a special effectathon some real heart. At its core this film is about redemption. Some have criticised how quickly Thor seems to learn his lesson, but they are not taking into account what befalls our hero in a very short space of time. He loses his power and is banished from his home and everyone he loves, and then is told his father is dead! Yes he quarrels with his father and grows inpatient with him, but he does still love him and those who think his transformation from angry young rebel to sad and regretful man, happens too quickly, should perhaps pay closer attention to the details. Chris Hemsworth plays the lead incredibly well, so well in fact that I cannot now imagine anyone else as the god of thunder. Tom Hiddleston gives I think, the standout performance of the film, his portrayal of the trickster god Loki is exceptional, subtle emotions like envy and regret briefly flash across his face to be quickly replaced with the impassive and other worldly look of a being who regards everyone else around them as mere insects. Loki is a villain with real depth who unlike the two dimensional villains Hollywood so fervently favours, is motivated by many sometimes conflicting desires, he is by far and away one of the most interesting characters in mythology, and I was very glad to see him portrayed as an unashamedly complicated individual.As someone who grew up with Norse mythology I was particularly impressed with the films realisation of Asgard and Bifrost, the rainbow bridge. The film takes the stargate route with the Asgardians and explains that, while they were once worshipped as gods, they are in fact a technologically advanced race, even going so far as to directly quote Arthur C Clark who said that, technology sufficiently advanced would be indistinguishable from magic. The special effects in this film are breathtaking, and while the irascible Mr Hopkins may have thought them overused it is hard to see how the film could have been made with any less than we see.As a comic book adaptation this is very good indeed, and as a piece of cinema it's not bad either. Could some things have been done better, of course, that is true of almost every film ever made, but I for one enjoyed it very much, it's not a life changer or a film that leaves you wiping away the tears but it's not trying to be, its entertainment and I for one, was entertained.",Null,0,0,11 September 2011
