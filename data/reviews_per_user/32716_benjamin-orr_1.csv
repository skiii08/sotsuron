Skyfall," James is 'dead' then comes back to life for some more action
","SkyfallOn Friday I got the luxury of getting to see the new Movie Skyfall It is the newest installment into the James bond series. Overall I thought that the movie was good Especially in Imax! The beginning of the movie had a cool chase scene on motorcycles thru a foreign city. The chase ends when James and the man who he is chasing are brawling on the top of a train when James's assistant takes a shot at the man who is trying to get away from James but the shot misses the target and hits James and he falls off the train that was crossing a bridge at the time. So James is falling off the train into the water below the bridge. The movie has a great storyline tons of action. The story will keep your interest the entire time. The best part of the movie is the war fought towards the end of the movie. I will speak no more of the end of the movie for spoiler purposes. Now onto the acting. The acting was very well done, with Daniel Craig acting like he has been Bond for his entire life. Judi Dench once again is fantastic as playing M. The new Q played by Ben Wishaw makes a great actor for the role. The only difference I would have made is trying to get Andrew Garfield instead as the actor for Q. Great movie overall",9,1,8,16 November 2012
