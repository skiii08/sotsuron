Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Wondrous adventure movie
","I had read a lot of hype about this film, and many negative or mixed reviews.  After seeing it last night, however, I believe this film to be a pleasant and well-made adventure film, and a fine addition to the series.I sympathize with the criticisms of the film's plot and thin characters. The political background of the galaxy, clearly essential to the plot, is never satisfactorily explained, and several scenes which were written for emotional depth (one dying speech comes to mind) don't come off.However, as an adventure movie, the film is worthy.  Splendid visuals, a script consistent with the previous films (and adding several new mythological twists), and the wonderful musical score make the film worth seeing, for what it is.",4,0,1,19 May 1999
Saving Private Ryan," Intriguing calamity
","This film lives up to much of its hype.  It is, in fact, a morally ambiguous film about late World War 2, told from a soldier's perspective.  However, I wasn't nearly as impressed with the entire film as I was with the truly incredible opening sequence.  For much of its development, the film seems as aimless as its characters, searching for accomplishment and meaning in an otherwise chaotic environment.  Solid acting turns, although nothing superlative, from Hanks, Damon, and Norton, especially.",7,0,0,10 January 1999
Good Will Hunting," Spectacular script
","Yet another script (much like Pulp Fiction) that deserved its Oscar.  Damon, Williams, Affleck, and Driver are all wonderful as inner-city urbanites who try to make good on their respective talents, and the script leads them through a twisty maze of events on their way to a heartwarming ending. Williams isn't as overtly impressive here as in his historically great dramatic roles (Fisher King, World According to Garp, Dead Poets Society, Moscow on the Hudson), but his understated warmth justifies his Oscar-winning performance.",9,1,4,10 January 1999
