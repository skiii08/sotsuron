E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," Everyone will love this film!
","Sad, happy, funny, whatever.I saw this film when I was like five and I liked it than I saw it when it came to theaters I was like 11 than I just saw it like two mounts ago. This film is such a classic and that's because of the grate story, the terrific performances and the memorable special effects! Although this is a film about an extra terrestrial, I think it's also about people, all living things and what we do to them. Several scenes illustrate this like the frog scene and the paramedic scene. One very memorable part in my mind is when the government walks over the hill that has always given me the creeps.PLOT; when an extra terrestrial is left behind he must struggle to survive.He meats a boy and slowly becomes more attached to him. But not just Elliot and his sister know about this alien, yes there are others watching!I think this film can be seen by annoy age and appreciated, some scenes may be too intense for little children. I would rate this film 7half/10",8,0,1,1 October 2004
Finding Nemo," plot
","One of Pixars better films! This is defiantly a great film!Plot outline: Marlin (Albert Brooks) is a clown fish whose son Nemo, was taken by divers! So Marlin decides to go out in search of his son on the way he meets many odd fish such as Dory (Ellen DeGeneres) a short-term memory plagued fish and Nigel (Geoffrey Rush) a very helpful, but slightly absent mined pelican. The animation and lighting is terrific; do you know how hard it is to animate a fish? Or an anemone? Pretty tough stuff! To wrap it up I would have to say this is one of Pixars finer films for young and old alike! 7and1/2",9,0,2,8 September 2004
Elf," I lughed so hard my nose shot out my nose
","I had herd some good reviews, but I never liked Will Ferrell. After passing it by in the store like 9 times I decided to rent Elf. It was actually a lot better than I expected. It had a pretty well strung together plot and a lot of humor in-between. As a baby Buddy (Will Ferrell) crawls into Santa's bag at the orphanage and the elves decided to keep him. But one day buddy notices that he's six feet tall. His elf father(Bob Newhart) tells him were to find his real father (James Caan) , in New Your City. So Buddy goes in surch of his father. It kept me laughing up until about 20 minuets from the end. By that time I guess they had to tie it all up some how, it is still worth seeing. 8/10 Some mild language and crude humor that parents may want to look into before getting for young children.",7,2,6,19 January 2005
"Monsters, Inc."," plot/overview
","This film was Fun, i wont say it was a smash hit but it is definitely entertaining. Billy Crystal had some very funny lines, John Goodman was a little to sappy for my tastes but if you can take it in stride over all this is a good film.I might not have been to crazy about the acting but let me tell you about the animation: this films is one of Pixars best films as far an animation goes!Film plot:(doesn't give too much away.) Monsters, Inc. is a power company for monsters. Monsters use screams for power the only way to get screams is to scare kids. There is nothing more dangerous than touching a child!! but what happens if one comes into the monster world?!?!over all i would give this film 7 out of ten.",8,0,1,7 September 2004
The Lost World: Jurassic Park," If you like seeing dinosaurs step on good sets this is the movie for you
","I loved the first Jurassic Park film but I think I like this one more; there was a lot more action and you got into the film faster! If you like seeing dinosaurs on good sets, or like watching great special effects (as I do) you love this movie!PLOT; after Jon Hammond (Richard Attenborough) loses control of Ingin, they decide to take some dinosaurs back to San Francisco and use them and a huge attraction at a zoo. Meanwhile a team (Jeff Goldblum, Julianne Moore, Vince Vaughan and Richard Schiff) that Hammond created is also exploring the island, when the too teams met there are a lot of hard feelings because of the fact that Hammond's team has released all the caged dinosaurs!This is a terrific film 8/10!",9,10,13,30 September 2004
The Incredibles," Thay should have named this movie The Incredible Incredibules!
","OK the title says it all INCREDABUL! With the voice talents of Craig t. Nelson, Holly Hunter, Samuel L. Jackson, Jason Lee and oddly engulf a voice by director Brad Bird! This movie has been on my movie wish list for a wile and I just got around to seeing it a little before Thanksgiving, and man let me tell you it is INCREDABUL! Lots of action lots of comedy and some wonderfully executed family scenes!PLOT; (some spoilers!!!)A family supper heroes is forced to give up fighting crime dew to many lawsuits ageist the government. But when Mr. Incredible a.k.a. Bob Parr gets a call to fight crime he gladly accepts!Designer of supper hero close, Edna, she is sooo funny!8 Â½ out of ten stars!Parents Warning! This film is rated PG for action violence, I'd would recommend it for 7or 8 and up, but you may want to see it first.",8,0,1,30 November 2004
National Treasure," Funny and a good plot!
","What surprised me most about this film was how well it was put together. It had so much story, it was great! There was also a good mix of action and humor content. I walked in not knowing quite what to expect, I herd it was good but I still didn't know what to expect. I liked all there casting choices, Nicolas Cage, Diane Kruger, Justin Bartha I was also surprised to see Sean Bean and Jon Voight. The plot is very simple but with a lot of complex turns, but at the same time is some how easy to fallow. Ben Gates is searching for a treasure left by his ancestors, the founding fathers. They (the founding fathers) did a good job in hiding this treasure so it's not an easy job for Ben. Making it even harder is Ian Howe a treasure hunter as well; who also has his heart set on the treasure. A pretty excellent movie 8/10. Parents might want to consider seeing this movie before taking young children. (two dead bodies are seen and some violence)",8,0,0,18 January 2005
Jurassic Park," Wonderful! a must see!
","I enjoyed this movie a lot, I first saw it when I was like six or seven and was really scared like almost disturbed! But a few years later I saw it again and really enjoyed it! It has some monumental special effects and a very good plot! PLOT: John Hammond (Richard Attenborough) starts a park by using fossilized DNA to recreate dinosaurs, he than invites a teem of people (Sam Neal, Laura Dern, Jeff Goldblum and Martin Ferrero) to the island for a weekend to see what they think. But when the power fails a lot goes wrong!I have seen this film like 50 times and I love it, there is only unrealistic part;(besides the dinosaurs) there's a seen it the movie were Lex (Ariana Richards) is looking at the computer and she says smoothing like 'Unix! I know this!' This is unrealistic because Unix is a very complicated computer language and it's highly unlikely that a 14 or something year old would know it. Outer than that I would say that this is a wonderful film! 8/10",10,3,9,30 September 2004
