Blade Runner 2049," Pointless
","Found this film interesting but really boring, would definitely say the elvis scene was the best loved how this scene played out, but on a other note, it's really really slow movie and not much happens in it, left with a dead end. Please, the nudity in this film was pointless and seems like it depend on that to make it a good movie which really says it all. Less focus on that and more on the storyline I think would have made a better movie.",4,2,6,2 April 2020
The Town," Nudity
","Overall it was a good movie, watchable but on the parents guide is has blink and you will miss the strip club scene, whoever said this must have a very long blink as the strip club scene last for more than a minute. Really dont see the point of this scene at all so that's why I'm giving it 4 stars.",4,0,6,2 April 2020
