Airlift," Very nice!
","It's a good patriotic film. Not perfect or excellent, but it's very nice. Akshay Kumar plays the role very well. Songs are also good. However having Nimrat Kaur as the wife would not be recommended by me, but I don't think any actresses in Bollywood would properly be able to play the role of Amrita Katyal either. I was born in Kuwait and lived there for the first 7 years of my life and the setting was a bit different from the real Kuwait, but that was in 1990 and I wasn't born at that time. May not be entirely based on the true event but I'm only looking at the event and the result, which is that India evacuates Kuwait and brings all the Indians safe to India, which did happen. Well done movie.",9,0,0,31 January 2016
