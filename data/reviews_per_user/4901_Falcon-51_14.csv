The Incredible Hulk," Successful Rebirth
","Erin Bana and Jennifer Connelly were not the reason why the 1st Hulk film bombed. That was Ang Lee's fault; he should stick to other things. Although, I must admit Edward Norton and Liv Tyler are much better actors and a refreshing change for 'The Incredible Hulk'. Louis Leterrier is a relatively unknown director with very few films, but he knows a little something about action. Leterrier also director 'The Transporter' and 'The Transporter II.' Marvel comic films thrive from great action.Doc Sampson (Ty Burrell) Gen. Thaddeus 'Thunderbolt' Ross (William Hurt) Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) were all great cameos for Hulk Comic Fans. Also the appearance of Samuel Sterns (Tim Blake Nelson) indicates Hulk villain 'The Leader' might be a future Hulk sequel. Tony Stark's comments open the gateway for an Avengers Film.The film itself is filled with great action sequences. The computer created battle between Tim Roth's Abomination and Edward Norton's Hulk, was in my opinion, one of the greatest fight sequences ever filmed. High marks for helping regain hope for future Hulk films.",9,4,10,13 June 2008
Spider-Man 2," The Power of the Sun in the Palm of His Hand
","I believe that is the way Sam Raimi, must feel after witnessing the success of this movie in it's first few days.Since I was old enough to go to the movies by myself, I have never seen a film twice in the theater. I mean it's expensive $8 bucks for the film and then $10 more for soda and popcorn, but that all changed today. Some 20 years later I have found myself in a strange position, I have returned to the theater only a few days after watching the Midnight Screening to see this astonishing film again. I paid without feeling like I had wasted my money. I hope to return once more for a 3rd time. It is simply that good. Worth every penny.I don't know if Tobey Maguire or Kirsten Dunst turned in Oscar winning performances, but that's not why I went to see Spider-Man. The film was delivered in pure comic book form. Although you do not need to be a Spider-Man comic book fan to love this film it helps if you want to follow some of the inside jokes and why some dialog may sound familiar from old issue of Spider-Man.The film is graced by a great many things, fantastic special effects without over doing it, astounding performances from the entire cast, the right amount of comic relief to get you past the more somber moments, a super evil villain to set the pace and last but not least the beautiful and talented Kirsten Dunst who can keep your attention all by herself.It is not surprising that both men and women will love this film. Guys and kids will flock to see the greatest superhero ever swing through the best superhero movie ever, while women will surely enjoy the love story and moments that will bring a tear to ones eye. The only thing that was bad about this film is that it set the stakes to high and may be impossible to follow up this film with another squeal of equal or greater appreciation, I mean this truly is a hard act to follow. I have given a score of ten out of ten to movies that I can count on one hand from over 1400+ I have rated, but their is no doubt that this film gets that rating as well.In short this is the best film of 2004 and I doubt anything else will even come close.",9,0,0,5 July 2004
Blade," Vampires Galore
","Blade starts off exciting and with great special effects, but it ends the same way and that's why it loses it's punch. Rather than have a better ending fight sequence with some new and exciting moves or some fresh F/X, it just has a longer fight sequence and the same F/X. To be more specific Blade (Wesley Snipes) does the same thing in the beginning that he does in the end, except it's more drawn out. Since the film is an action film we don't concern ourselves with the terrible all around acting, but you need to change things up a bit if you want to prevent a tacky ending to an otherwise mediocre film. All around though it was not too bad and I give it just a little over average for an action film because it has plenty of action. The story is about a good vampire (Snipes) with superhuman abilities fighting bad vampires. Along the way he utilizes the help of some friends.",6,0,1,20 May 2000
X-Men," Action Packed Fun
","The greatest comic book of all time is transformed into a very well made film. Incredible special effects and a great cast make this a must see film. You do not need to be a comic book or X-Men fan to enjoy this action packed block buster, but you may enjoy it more if you are a fan. The film does not have the best acting in the world, but action films aren't necessarily made for superb acting. Still there were a few performances worthy of mentioning. Patrick Stewart better known for his 'Star Trek: The Next Generation' role is one of the better performances. In this film he plays Professor X the leader of a school for gifted children. Film veteran Ian McKellen turns in the best performance of the bunch. He plays the powerful revenge seeking mutant Magneto. Coincidentally both Stewart and McKellen are English and about the same age. Stewart enjoyed a birthday the day before the 'X-Men' premiere.Australian born actor Hugh Jackman has his hands full playing the X-Men's principal character Wolverine. He appears to be a good casting choice despite the fact that the comic version Wolverine has a stronger build and has a Canadian accent. Oscar winning actress Anna Paquin plays the character known as Rogue, but she suffers from the same problems as Wolverine, she is supposed to have an accent. In her case that of a southern belle, but she is observed only a few times actually trying to muster one. However aside from the few flaws the film is really sensational. You get to see three beautiful and talented ladies Halle Berry, Famke Janssen, and Rebecca Romijn-Stamos.
Look for Ray Park's particularly entertaining role as the otherwise disgusting mutant called Toad. The best costume of the bunch would go to Tyler Mane's character Sabretooth whom most closely resembles his comic book counterpart. Halle Berry's costume would follow a close second.The film is about two groups of mutants living in a world were they are not wanted. One group focuses there unique individual powers on bettering themselves and one day protecting those who do not trust them. The others are revenge seeking mutants and want to wage war on humanity because of their differences. It will take mutants against mutants in order to save humanity.",8,0,0,14 July 2000
American Beauty," Sensational
","You can read 1000 reviews and learn that Kevin Spacey and Annette Bening did an excellent job in there 'American Beauty' performances. So I am just repeating that which is so disturbingly obvious. It should also be mentioned that Thora Birch, Wes Bentley, and Mena Suvari were no less sensational in Sam Mendes film directorial debut. The Academy awarded 'American Beauty' the best picture Oscar for 1999 and it had some stiff competition. Personally I would have chosen 'The Sixth Sense' as best picture but that does not take away from the fact that 'American Beauty' was a sensational film.Sam Mendes deserves the Oscar he was awarded as well. Although new to the big screen Sam Mendes is not new to directing, he is a popular British theater director with credits that include 'Cabaret' and 'The Blue Room.' It's hard to find anything wrong with the film, and I wasn't looking, but I think they could have done without the Thora Birch nude scene. Since she was only 17 at the time special permission had to be obtained from the California child labor board and her parents had to be on the set during the scene. That is reason enough to have left it out and I'm not sure it was even important to the story's development. Still it is the only gripe I have and it is very minor.The story is a comedy/drama with dark humor about a middle class family that looks good on the outside but is crumbling on the inside. Lester Burnham (Spacey) is the man that hates his job and is stuck in a loveless relationship with his wife Carolyn (Bening). Jane (Birch) is there teenage daughter that resents both of them and thinks they have gone crazy. The neighbors include a drug selling teenage boy (Bentley) and a homophobic, ex-marine father (Cooper). Finally there is Angela (Suvari) Jane's friend and a precocious vixen that Lester become infatuated with.  You may remember Suvari as Heather in 'American Pie.' This is one of those films you can't afford to miss.",9,0,0,16 May 2000
Spider-Man," Spectacular Spider-Man Movie
","A few liberties were taken with the origin of the web slinging hero, but a dated character will need a little help making it in today's world. This created a modern day Spider-Man that took block-buster to a whole new level, shattering box office records in it's opening week. Adults and kids alike could finally experience a big screen adventure with Spider-Man. He's a character that's been in comic books for decades. It even crossed gender lines as many girls flocked to the theater, perhaps because of the kookie little love story. Spider-Man's CO-creator Stan Lee had a cameo in the film. The special effects were great and the action was almost nonstop. Don't analyze the movie just enjoy it. Millions of dollars in sales can't be wrong. Lets hope the sequels turn out to be half as good.
Superman and Batman were products of DC Comics, Marvels biggest competitor. Did anyone notice that only the 1st Superman and 1st Batman films were really big hits and their sequels all were huge disappointments?  Hopefully this curse will not befall the Amazing Spider-Man. Spidey has a few things going for him though. First of all he is Marvel's flagship character and not to take anything away from DC, but Marvel super villains have always been a whole lot cooler. Second advances in special effects can do almost anything today so we can expect to see spidey do a lot of really neat stuff. Finally Tobey McGuire actually looks like Peter Parker making him a perfect fit. Batman suffered changes in 3 lead actors throughout 4 movies which got consistently worse and none resembled Bruce Wayne the man behind the mask.Spider-Man appears on the screen exactly the way you would expect him to be in the comics. They captured that image perfectly. The liberties I already mentioned, work a lot better in an updated version recreated for the BIG screen. This must be Marvel's decade as we await more super powered action flicks such as, The Incredible Hulk, X-2 and sequels to Spider-Man. Keeping comics cool with movies is a great way to enjoy your favorite childhood super-heroes all over again!",9,0,1,20 May 2003
Dark City," Descent Film-Noir & Sci-Fi Flick
","'Dark City' is a good example of what good special effects can do for a movie. Still there is so much more this film could have accomplished. The story was a bit confusing and when things started to clear up towards the end there was still a lot of unanswered questions. A more well defined story could have helped. Let me give an example using two more popular films. Take 'Godzilla' and 'Jurassic Park' both featured great F/X but only the latter had a strong exciting story. Now granted 'Jurassic Park' & 'Godzilla' were aimed at a younger audience, but then take 'The Matrix' into account. Here is a film with strong appeal to adults, great special effects, and an exciting story. Still I give 'Dark City' above average marks for descent acting and originality. William Hurt was delightful as always and Kiefer Sutherland who is one of my favorite actors does a good job as the mad scientist although anyone could have probably played the part. I'm still glad it was him though.The story is about a guy named John Murdoch (Sewell) that awakens in a bathtub with very little memory and soon finds he is being sought for murder. In his attempts to escape he learns about some strange beings that control the dark world he is living in and finds that they posses great power. In time Murdoch finds he has some surprises of his own. Frank Bumstead (Hurt) is the inspector that captures Murdoch and thereafter realized that there are some strange things happening. Dr. Schreber (Sutherland) is a some what unwilling pawn of the menace known only as the Strangers. A definite for Film-Noir & Sci-Fi buffs.",7,1,3,3 June 2000
1941," Whatever Floats Your Boat
","In 1975 Speilberg gave us the spine tingling horror of 'Jaws.' In 1977 we were visited by the mothership in the awe inspiring 'Close Encounters of the Third Kind.' In 1981 he made 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' a modern day artifact. He then took time to write 'Poltergeist.' Finally in 1982 he put together one of his greatest and most profitable films to date 'E.T. the Extra Terrestrial.' So with these credentials what happened right smack dab in the middle in 1979 when he tried to pull together '1941.' With this odd ball comedy you either like it or you don't. It's either funny or it's not. Sometimes when there are a number of huge stars you expect too much and then become disappointed when your anticipation is not met.Another example of this is 'The Bonfire of the Vanities' you may feel the story lacks but still appreciate it for the big stars whether they meet your expectations or not. Myself I didn't care for '1941' on the other hand I liked 'The Bonfire of the Vanities.' The point is for every good review you read about '1941' your bound to find a bad one and the only way you will truly know is to see the film yourself. If you like that 'Three Stooges' type comedy then you may appreciate '1941.' There is no doubt that this is not Speilberg's finest work, but it does offer some laughs. Now if you are one of those types that must see everything Speilberg has his hands in then you need to add this to your rental list.The film is a comedy centered around California preparing to defend itself from a possible Japanese attack. In it's wake a silly Japanese submarine crew delivers many of the laughs.",4,16,29,1 May 2000
Toy Story," Truly Magical
","Toy Story is truly the 1st movie of it's kind. I don't know what it's really called but I think digital animation best describes it. 3D toys delighting both children and adults alike. Not only is the film irresistibly funny it is also has a clever story and unlike many movies of today you can watch this one over and over. The voices are done by a host of popular names that we all know and love. Some of the most popular being Tom Hanks as Woody, Tim Allen as Buzz Lightyear, Don Rickles as Mr. Potato Head, and John Ratzenberger as Hamm. Jim Varney even lends his hilarious voice as Slinky the Dog. The story is about a boy (Andy) that gets a new toy (Buzz Lightyear) for his birthday. Andy's previous favorite toy (Woody) feels forgotten. After a series of mis-adventures the two find themselves away from the home and must learn to work together to find their way back. The film is followed by a sequel 'Toy Story 2' which is just as popular if not better than this one. A film that is Truly Magical.",9,1,3,6 February 2000
Eyes Wide Shut," Eyes on Cruise and Kidman
","Stanley Kubrick directed other great films like Full Metal Jacket, A Clockwork Orange, The Shining, 2001: A Space Odyssey and much more. The movies mentioned above he also wrote and helped produce. His talent is so vast that his films come in great variety. Just from the films listed above one is a War Film, A look into a possible future, A Horror epic, and a Sci-Fi adventure. Now he comes out with a suspense filled, sexual thriller. You cannot help but keep your Eyes Wide Open and the dialogue will keep your ears open too. I was surprised by much of what was said. What appears to be soft porn is actually a story of Love, Trust and Faithfulness. Tom Cruise and Wife Nicole Kidman did the film justice. It is sad that we will enter a future without new Kubrick films and he will be sorely missed. R.I.P. Mr. Kubrick.",8,0,0,15 October 1999
Pretty Woman," Simple and enjoyable
","One of America's favorite actresses, Julia Roberts, does a wonderful job with one of America's favorite actors, Richard Gere. The story is about a prostitute named Vivian Ward (Roberts) who's life is turned around for the better when she meets rich business tycoon Edward Lewis (Gere). Heart warming rags-to-riches type story. Look for 'Sienfeld's' Jason Alexander as Gere's Lawyer and 'Just Shoot Me's' Laura San Giacomo as Roberts excitable roommate.",7,1,2,14 March 2000
Pulp Fiction," Tarantino's Finest
","You don't go and see a Tarantino written film without expecting to see guns, gore, vulgarity and everything else associated with graphic violence. It is his style and he is a master at it. The fact is if you did not like the film and you knew he was involved you can only blame yourself. This particular film was well written (Kudos to Roger Avary for helping Tarantino). The film is definitely Oscar material that is why it received so many nominations in top spots. Best Picture, Best Actor, Best Supporting Actor, Best Supporting Actress and Best Director to name a few. Unfortunately I believe the violence prevented it from winning any of the major awards, but Tarantino and Avary did get Oscars for Writing it.Their is talk about quarter pounders in France, foot massages and what it's like to kill a person. If you can follow the film which basically runs backwards and if you are not offended by topics like violence, rape and drug use you are probably a Tarantino fan already.Finally who cares where Tarantino got his inspiration from 80% of that film was exactly what you expect it to be, and 20% of it is surprises for you his fans. Travolta, Jackson, Willis, Rames and Thurman have my highest regards for a job well done. I give the film a 10 out of 10.   >",10,0,0,18 October 1999
Titanic," Film about doomed ocean liner attracts the masses
","What can be said about `Titanic' that hasn't already been said? Seriously who hasn't seen it? Well if your one of the few and you finally decided to take the uhmm. Splash (pun intended) there are a few rules you need to remember. First, give yourself time for an intermission the film is quite long. Second, the film caters to all people. There is a love story for the pre-teen girls and for hopeful romantics (generally women) and for us guys there are some cool special effects in one of the most intense disaster films ever made. The final rule, sit back and enjoy.Working with a `Titanic' budget James Cameron (director) put this gem together and created this intriguing story. Obviously the fate of the doomed ocean liner is true, but the fictitious love story is thrown in to attract more viewers. Warning there is a brief, but tastefully done nude scene and parental guidance is suggested. Also the illustrations of death and dying in the later parts of the film may be a bit too much for younger viewers. Now aside from that, I mean honestly, what more convincing do you need? The film earned over a billion dollars worldwide and scored a number of Oscars including best director and best picture.",9,2,3,4 April 2002
The Sixth Sense," A Landmark Film
","Thought provoking, chilling, original and just plain entertaining, 'The Sixth Sense' is an absolutely wonderful film. This is one film that will leave it's mark on film making for a long time to come. Haley Joel Osment who plays (Cole Sear) is incredibly talented and though he is not new to the big screen this is the one that really got him noticed. So much in fact he was nominated for an Oscar. Bruce Willis plays (Malcolm Crowe) the psychologist that tries to help Cole. Bruce Willis has also never been finer. As he takes a break from his customary tough-guy role to show that he can do a wonderful job in other areas.The film is about a boy that can see dead people and is living in constant fear and wants help, but he must first find someone to believe him before they can help him. You will love the unexpected twists and turns of this film. Don't let this one pass you by.",9,0,0,7 April 2000
