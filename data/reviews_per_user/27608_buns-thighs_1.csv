Ford v Ferrari," Fantastic!
","My dad grew up watching and listening on the radio about Fords attempt to beat Ferrari and he would share these stories with me growing up. So this movie was a huge deal to me. The movie does a great job how much it meant for America to beat the unbeatable Ferarri but also how snobby of a person Ford the 2nd was to his employees. Christian Bale and Matt Damon's chemistry was the best part of the film in my opinion. Bale stands out the most playing the crazy driver who got the GT40 to 220mph! I highly recomend this movie if you're a car lover, or even a history lover. Great work!",10,4,14,15 November 2019
