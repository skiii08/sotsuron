Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," definitely a Star Wars movie, but far from the best....
","Don't get me wrong, it was worth the wait to see it but I can see why some of the critics gave it bad reviews.As a Star Wars movie the music and special effects were over the top and over the scale, thank god for ILM (industrial light and magic) and John Williams score writing.But the plot was, well lets say there could be more to it then there was. I am not saying it was terrible plot but it doesn't come close to the originals (episode iv,v,vi).First of all I felt Jar Jar Binks was a little over done, don't add him to episode ii please.Anakin Skywalker had a little too much press time, considering the film is supposed to deal with a trades war.And finally there was too little time with Darth MaulOther then that the movie was pretty cool.Liam Neeson made a pretty cool jedi knight/master as Qui-Gon Jinn as did Ewan McGregor as Obi-Wan Kenobi.I liked Samuel L. Jackson as Mace Windu and Yoda.Coruscant was awsome as was the Jedi Council Chamber.The other characters were cool as well like Queen Amidala/Paddame and Senator Palpatine (is he or isn't he Darth Sidious?, I think so.)As George Lucas said this film was aimed mostly at kids but episode ii is supposed to be the romantic one perhaps this will appeal more to adults (as well as the awesome 'Clone Wars') as did 'The Empire Strikes Back'. Here's hoping.This film gets a 8/10",8,0,0,20 May 1999
Mission: Impossible," The movie was pretty cool except it was just minus one thing.....PLOT!!!!
","'Your mission Jim should you choose to accept it is to annihilate your I.M.F. team, and deliver JOB1:14 to your arms dealer' I must admit this film left me speechless. Why would these stupid writers put Jim Phelps as the bad guy? After all these years in the TV series where he is an honourable leader, you suddenly make him turn criminal?!!! Why don't you just make all the superheros turn supervillians or Luke Skywalker turn to the dark-side and the Emperor wins!I did like JUST about everything else though, minus the helicopter scene in the tunnel.Plot- 1/10Everthing else- 8/10",Null,0,0,21 February 1999
The Truman Show," One of the best movies of the year, it gives you a message of 'what if...?'
","What if you were put on this planet for a specific reason?, What  if you are the most important person there is?,What if you are just a pawn in for someone elses game that you are not aware of? These are questions that almost everyone asks themselves now and then in their life-time. For Truman Burbank his whole life are all answers to these questions. He's just on a 24 hour, 7 days a week, soap opera of his life where he is the star, only he's unaware of it. To him life is normal in his happy sappy world, but he is the only true person, everyone else are just actors, even his family. He suddenly wakes up and smells the coffee when he notice's strange things or accidents such as his wedding pictures, the elevater incident, and many more. My only question would be why would you do this to someone? I think its cruel to use anyone as a pawn in a game (I'm talking real life not chess). When I'm feeling low sometimes I ask myself am I for some purpose?, is there a big brother (your own personal angel you could call it even) figure looking after just me? or, am I just like everyone else?Where as Trumans life was controlled in his happy sappy communistic type world where he never gets a moment to himself (except maybe when he's using the crapper), are's is as well, through corrupt goverments, spy satellites, armies, etc etc etc......I do believe I'm here for some reason, whether I'm the pawn of the world or everyone is with me I don't know but the latter is probably right (or is it?). I give this movie a ****/***** So, Good morning! And in case I don't see you: good afternoon, good evening and good night!",Null,0,0,22 March 1999
The Matrix," It's like having almost every cool sci-fi film all rolled into one really cool film!!
","Almost every film can be compared to two or three other films such as, 'Volcano'='Dante's Peak' meets 'Earthquake'. 'The Matrix' is, Terminator and Terminator 2 meets Total Recall meets Men in Black meets Hackers meets Dark City meets Seven Monkeys.It combined all these ideas from the movies (I think anyways)and came up with a cool idea that doesn't really rip off these films. The 'Star Wars Trilogy' did the same thing, except it got its ideas from historic events, and historic things, historic people (Hitler, Knights, Soldiers).'The Matrix' idea was in a way original. I like the idea of the future that no one Knows of or cares except a few individuals who found out the truth and are fighting to destroy the Matrix. The idea that you can alter things and get what you want within seconds such as billions of guns and learning to fly a helicopter.This film deserves 4.5/5",Null,0,0,7 April 1999
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," Too many pros not enough cons (none that I can find anyway)
","The Empire Strikes Back CLASS-drama, action, fantasy, sci-fi PROS-Classic musicical score from John Williams was at the right places and times,lots of famous last words, excellent sequences (astroid field, was my top favourite), spectaculor f/x everywhere, superb acting and characters, very original idea, this movie doesn't rip off of any movie (except maybe star wars but 'no duh' it is the sequel) movies rip off it such as independence day. CONS-Cons?!!,what cons? RATING-10/10",Null,0,0,3 January 1999
