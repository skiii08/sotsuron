Hereditary," 300. Hereditary. Super creepy!
","300. Hereditary. I thought it was super creepy good. Follows a family that has some really bad luck, or is it something more sinister? Or it just could be a movie about the horrors of mental illness. So, Annie's mother just passed away, we get the impression that she wasn't all there towards the end, and as the family puts the affairs in order they start finding out more about grandma, and the stress of it all seems to awaken Annie's own struggles with mental illness. Annie's daughter Charlie is quite the odd child, besides cutting heads off dead pigeons and being very British looking, clucking her tongue absentmindedly, creepy, Charlie also struggling with the loss of her grandmother reveals part of their private convos, seems granny wanted her granddaughter to be a grandson, but why?? Movie definitey sets a creepy tone, and keeps you tense all the way through. In a weird way it reminded me of another super creepy movie, The Witch. Watch em both!

Captain Marvel," Generic Super Hero Film...
","318. Captain Marvel. The story of a small town girl living in a lonely world, that works on top secret technology, then gets zapped by that technology turning her into a super hero with no memory!! An alien super hero with no memory, but wait no, she's a human, transfused with alien blood with no memory... cause she's kinda kidnapped by these aliens called Kree, the good looking ones, who are at war with the ugly ones called Skrulls. And as the war comes to Earth, truths come out, and she comes face to face with Nick Fury, and doing some quick math, Nick Fury is ummm, old. But anyways. It's a fun movie, with a rather generic storyline to introduce a character, that was kind of hinted at in the last few seconds of Avengers Infinity War. Filmbufftim on FB.",4,37,62,21 March 2019
Us," Freaky Good Time!!
","322. Us. What a creepy good time!! So the Wilson family is on holiday at the beach, when one freaky night, they are attacked by...themselves?? Get Out, right?!? But yep, it seems like we the people have some kind of doppelganger living in our shadow that wants to Get Out, and this seems to be the day to do it. Now they seem to be kind of zombie-ish mimicking our behaviour, except one, the twinner of the main character, Adelaide, and she has a story to tell, and it is so good! Ok so, at the beginning the audience is told about secret and abandoned tunnels all over the country, so I assume this is where our twinners live, however I also noticed in the familys home video collection they have a copy of C.H.U.D. (for those young kids, it stands for Cannibalistic Humanoid Underground Dwellers) coincidence?? And also a copy of A Nightmare on Elm Street can be seen, all the twinners wear leather gloves on one hand and carry scissors, I can't help but think Freddy... Was Jordan giving us hints where he gets his ideas from? Indeed what a good creepy flick! Absolutely loved the ending, and I'll say it... Lupita Nyong'o is gorgeous! Get Out of the house and go see it!! Filmbufftim on FB.",9,2,7,27 March 2019
Ready Player One," 229. Ready Player One.
","So while all the Marvel nerds were waiting to see who's contract at Disney was too expire, I mean, which characters will die off in Avengers, me, being my own nerd, went to the 1:30am showing of this one. Yes, I was alone in the theatre, therefore I could shout with glee at every 80's reference I spotted out. Just so you know I owned and played Atari's Adventure, and too this day thinking it was not as cool as ColecoVision's Venture!! But anyways, the movie was pretty bad ass, some of the best CGI interacting with humans yet!! This movie revolves a young boy named Anakin Skwalker, oh wait, Wade, who lives in a bleak future, no its not a Netflix sci fi, the poor are poorer and, well you know. But too escape it all there's the OASIS, a virtual reality world, where you can virtually be anything or anyone. The creator of this world was a super genius and now also a corpse, but before he went off to chill with Hawking, and Chris Farley, he hid some easter eggs in his world and created a contest, in which the winner, gets to rule OASIS. But of course the virtual world is also a cash cow for greedy corporations and they have created a virtual army, but made of real people, virtually, that train virtually night and day to win it all for themselves. Luckily for Wade he has a pretty rad group of pod racing virtual friends to help him on his quest... Along the way meeting Art3mis, spoiler alert, sparks fly between the two avatars, does Wade ever meet the girl hiding behind the avatar, well ya know she doesn't really look like the avatar, and Wade is all about love man, so looks don't matter. Unfortunately when they do meet, our worst fears are true, shes a monster. She has a huge birthmark across her face, children run in terror. But Wade true to his word, sticks it out. Who will win the little guy or corporate greed? It's a movie, that's easy. Filmbufftim on FB.",8,1,5,29 April 2018
Bird Box," She can handle a speeding bus, Apocalypse no prob!
","301. Bird Box. Reminded me a lot of A Quiet Place, and a little bit of Cell. An invisible force comes along and makes people see visions that lead them to kill themselves. We meet pregnant Mallory (yo! Mallory!) while the apocalypse is going down, but don't worry she's played by Sandra Bullock, if she can handle a speeding bus, she can handle the end of the world. It does follow the typical holed up in a house with sort of friendly strangers while the rest of the world dies outside, and it also follows the typical demise of the friendly strangers holed up in a house while the rest of the world dies outside... However there is rumors of a safe haven, ya know she's just gotta ride down a raging river blindfolded with two kids for roughly a two day journey, but its cool. Now that I really think about it... The Office fans: remember when Pam accidentally rents 28 Days Later, the zombie movie, thinking that it was 28 Days with Sandra Bullock. This is that imagined movie. It was a cool flick though I can't say it was a game changer or anything... the way the memes popped up, I was expecting, I dunno what, lol... Filmbufftim on FB.",6,1,4,11 January 2019
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse," A refreshing break from the usual Marvel flicks...
","325. Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse. I'm going to label it as my favorite Spider-Man movie so far. It looked like a comic book and it felt like a comic book, Nic Cage is in it, and it also deals with one of my fave sci fi subjects multiple universes! Yep so in one of these universes, Spider-Man is battling Kingpin at a particle accelerator, ya know those things that scientists use to possibly create another big bang, or in this case open a doorway to other worlds that coincidentally have their own versions of Spider-Man, but oh yea, back to the point...Spoiler... Spidey loses his fight with Kingpin this day, and also loses his life, and the world mourns. However coincidence strikes again, the same day Spidey dies, a radioactive spider bites Miles Morales and replaces Peter Parker, harsh right?? However, due to the little crossing of the streams at the particle accelerator, a whole bunch of rad versions of the webbed vigilante is stuck here giving the new Spider-Man a very quick course in being a superhero!! A refreshing take on a story that's been done numerous times, and look forward to its inevitable inferior sequel. Filmbufftim on FB.",10,0,1,13 April 2019
Avengers: Endgame," A Time Travel Convoluted Mess.
","333. Avengers: Endgame. After the events of Infinity War, which did not last for infinity, cell phone gamer Thermos got his wish he deleted half his apps on his phone, after collecting all the Bejeweled gems. So what now? Well, those of the game app The Avengers that are left, get mad, so they stroll over to Thermos' place and behead him, rather easily... the excuse is, cause he was worn out and weak after using the stones, yea ok lets go with that. So what now? The End? Right??? No, they're not satisfied with the realization that in war people die, even the good guys, so the answer is: Time Travel. Thus a convoluted plan is born to travel through time, getting the stones back to create the game glove to bring all the dead folks back. So by now I've sure you've seen it, so spoilers be damned and my issue with the ending... The Captain America time line... The movie states, all other time travel movies are wrong, they're rules are right. You jump through to a different time, that is your reality now. So the Avengers plan works, though they screw up each timeline they go to, giving Disney enough material to make alternate universe versions of the same movie forever, oh wait, they do that now... The final act is for the Captain to bring the final stone back, to his original time and come back, to i guess rebuild and get ready for Avengers 5, i dunno. But he decides to stay back then and make a life with his lost lady love, creating his own new timeline, where he still got all muscley apparently, however this would mean that all the events of the MCU did not take place in the Captains new timeline, so when he randomly shows up as an old man to the spot where he left the other timeline, a timeline he ended by leaving it...the events of his life were drastically different and in creating this new time line, the others are null and void because they now exist in an alternate universe where old Steve Rogers does not. If your gonna say all other time travel movies are wrong, at least follow your own rules. Filmbufftim on FB.",4,37,57,21 May 2019
Avengers: Infinity War," More of the same...
","303. Avengers: Infinity War. Heres what I get... There's a big cell phone game app fan out there named Thermos, he loves Bejeweled and Pokemon Go so much, that he decided to combine the two... search for the jewels in real life!! Collect them all, get free gifts, lives, reverse previous mistakes, you've played the games you know how they work. But little does Thermos know, the game apps feel him as a threat, once he collects all the gems, Thermos snaps his fingers and poof all the game apps Thermos doesn't like poof! Gone! So what happens is another app called the Avengers go after Thermos. Now I've played the game apps before, and I always thought that each Avenger had their own unique powers, which after watching this, they're all pretty much equal, and in most cases its the uniform they wear that gives them the power. So Thermos wants to delete half the apps because his cell's memory is almost full. Logical. But the Avengers being just an app themselves feel threatened, but luckily they can power up anytime, somehow they can change the pre existing uniform they wear to combat any situation they are in! Awesome. it all takes place within the Sims universe, obviously, because only the Sims would be oblivious to the alien invasion happening all around them and still go to work the next day, and the Avengers know they are just Sims, otherwise they wouldn't be throwing out one liners while the city and its population are being destroyed around them. In the end Thermos gets his way and kills off half of the apps!! Until he gets an upgrade on his cell for Avengers: Endgame, and/or Disney contracts are negotiated. Also loved the recreation of the battle scene from Star Wars: Episode 1: The Phantom Menace. Droid army Vs the Naboo... only now it was Thermos' computer viruses Vs Wakanda... you're sayin that wasn't intentional? Filmbufftim on FB.",3,2,2,13 January 2019
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Brad Pitt drives, Leo Coughs
","350. Once Upon a Time in... Hollywood. A movie that answers the big questions like: What is Brad Pitt's driving skills like? Or, what does Leonardo Dicaprio look like hacking up a lung? They will be answered because a large portion of this three hour long movie is dedicated to just that. Brad Pitt driving by himself listening to the popular tunes of the late 60's, Brad Pitt driving Leo around while Leo hacks up a lung from smoking and drinking, and Brad Pitt driving while flirting with one of the Manson girls he just happens to keep running into... OK with that out of the way, its a really cool movie, cool concept and of course great acting, writing and directing. Has the Tarantino signature, multiple separate storylines coming into one explosive finale... Basically its the story of a down on his luck actor, Rick Dalton, and his stunt double/bestie, Cliff Booth, and as I said earlier, Cliff drives a lot because his bestie Rick has racked up quite a few DUI's so... and at the same time... we have Rick's new neighbors on Cielo Drive, the Polanski's, Sharon Tate coming into her own stardom and enjoying life, and we also have Cliff's solo driving adventures where he picks up a Manson girl hitching and meets the rest of the family on the ranch, all leading up to the events of August 9, 1969. A pretty sweet ride, I think its the least violent of all Tarantino's movies, but don't worry there's a bit of bloodiness thrown in to make you say, 'there it is'!

A Quiet Place," 227. A Quiet Place.
","227. A Quiet Place. Freaky awesomeness!! After Jim left Dunder-Mifflen things drastically changed in Pennsylvania!! This film takes place several years after the collapse of the paper company Dunder-Mifflen, leading to the collapse of the entire world government. Paper was no longer needed, people no longer read, instead they transformed into blind/arachnids from Starship Troopers/Venom looking creatures that hunt by sound. Now we all know Jim and Pam Halpert were smart people and taught theyre kids Ce-Ce, and Philip along with a third child (ooops spoiler alert) to read therefore they remained human. Sure there's suvivors here and there... Dwight K. Shrute of course knew this was coming and disappeared weeks before hand with Angela and son. But now the world is a super quiet place, and any sound out of the ordinary, these mothers attack!!! So the story takes place on Shrute Farms, as you'll be able to see Dwight eventually gave up on beets and turned to growing corn, and it revolves around the final days of Pam's pregnancy, thats right #4 on the way!! (Let me say Pam does look slightly different in this, I think it was the hair, but still gorgeous!!) Yes, I think having a baby during an apocalypse is a bit irresponsible, add to it not being able to make a sound during birth is just something Michael Scott would do. But yea, and of course when it happens, Pam is alone. Ce-Ce stormed off, a little father/daughter tension...spoiler alert... Ce-Ce is now deaf, as you may have guessed, one too many Scrantonicity II concerts, and a firework incident by Dwight certainly didn't help. And Jim is out with Philip teaching him how to hunt in silence in the wild, and yep... Pam's water breaks, and from this point on it was pure tension...a human being pushed out of your privates with no drugs, on your own, and oh yea, you can't make a sound, which yea...doesn't happen. It really was an awesome flick, tense. The monsters were terrifying and weren't really explained all that much so it gave it more of an open feeling i dunno. I say watch it!! So, who picked up any strange vibes or messages that the movie slipped in? Just wondering. filmbufftim on FB.",9,1,2,26 April 2018
It Chapter Two," I am the eater of worlds...
","355. It Chapter Two. I loved Chapter One, I loved Chapter Two. Picks up 27 years after the events of the original, you know, when the Losers Club defeated Pennywise, had a child orgy and made a promise to come back if Pennywise returned. That's not what happened? And right on schedule Robert Gray appears back on the scene to eat some children. Mike Hanlon, the only member of the Losers Club to stay in Derry and witnesses what's going on, starts making some calls to the other members of the group and asks them all to come home, the issue with that is, people who leave Derry tend to forget Derry, so it takes some begging, and they all all make it home, well, almost. And as they each explore the town, Pennywise comes out to play to welcome them home, cause he's missed them, they're like the ones that got away. Leading up to a showdown to bring an end to Pennywise, once and for all. Pretty sweet creepy effects once again, good casting of the adult losers club!! End Pennywise once and for all.. LOL... Yes the million years old Pennywise was defeated by the Losers Club, which they did 27 years prior as well. How did the defeat him once and for all, by performing a ritual passed down to Mike by a group of Native Americans, who performed the ritual and then were promptly eaten by Pennywise. My guess is, Pennywise likes these games. At the end of the day, Pennywise finished his cycle of eating Derry's precious little bundles of joy, got a kick out of The Loser's Club actually coming back to get their asses kicked once again, losing a few losers along the way, put on a little show for them, and went to sleep, and will come back to suck the marrow from their grandchildren's bones in 27 years. :) All Hail The Crimson King!!

Inside Llewyn Davis," Great Coen Brothers movie!!
","Inside Llewyn Davis. A grown man with a cat... Another great Coen Brothers movie. About a folk singer played by Oscar Isaac, in which we follow him for a week, he's just trying to play some tunes man. Sure he's penniless, homeless, sleeps with other dudes girls, these things happen man. Filled with a great soundtrack, unique characters, well written, great acting, and it has Salieri himself! And a staple of Coen Bros movie John Goodman, you want a toe, I can get you a toe believe me. But yea I thought this one was pretty awesome, the Coen's characters are always so believable, and intense for the most part. So see it dammit! Where is his scrotum?
