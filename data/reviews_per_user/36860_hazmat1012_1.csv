The Avengers," Beyond Expectations!
","First of all, I never give anything a 10 because that means perfection and giving the movie a 9 also leaves some kind of room for improvement for any potential future Avengers movies. With that in mind, I may even give this a 9.5.After movies such as Spiderman being a disappointment and having the newest Batman series to compare to The Avengers, I wasn't sure what to expect. Also, taking into consideration that the latest Marvel movies such as the X-men Origin movies and individual Avengers (Ironman 1 and 2, Thor, Hulk) seeming to have fairly good ratings, or at least good movies to me, I was almost curious if this was going to be a disappointment after a streak of good movies. At the same time, I usually walk into movies with low expectations so if it is a let down, I'm not as let down as other people are. However, with this movie, I couldn't help but to have a higher expectation seeing previous Marvel movies.So, being really excited for this movie, during and after the movie I was thrilled with it. It blew my mind and I seriously felt like a kid in awe and they did so well taking childhood characters and making it possible to be watched by any age.For the tough critics, if you are not a fan of comic book superheros or just not a fan of any of the Marvel/DC movies, I would recommend this film if I was to try to change your mind. I know some who were let down by Thor and/or Captain America, and a couple people who were slightly disappointed by Iron-Man, then I believe The Avengers movie will fully redeem those disappointments for you.If you also haven't seen any of the individual Avengers movies (Thor, Ironman 1 & 2, Captain America, Hulk), it's not an absolute much to watch, I do believe it sure does help though. So, if you're going to see any movie this year, this will be a great one to watch!",10,2,7,9 May 2012
