Alien 3," Why people thinks it is so baaaaad....
","..because Fincher had balls to change whole idea of Alien Trilogy. Cameron made pure action alien movie (and it was absolutely fantastic). Fincher did not want this copy Cameron's idea and he's back to beginning. Atmosphere of the prison is serious and story isn't packed only with action and gun shooting. Please take a look on details, like scene where we see a born of alien. It's amazing how director combined the issue of birth and Dillon's speech. Great thrill...Alien 3 has great ending, without patterns seen in the other s-f movies. So, I give 9/10, because Special edition is better, but standard version is still great, great movie.",9,5,69,3 September 2008
Terminator Salvation," This is not a Terminator at all...
","Pros: - some nice CGI effects (first battle and Harvester scene) - good sound - Marcus Wright - cinematography (in Childen of Men style...sometimes), shooting style etc. - Bale as Connor is quite goodCons: - awkward story, including big plot holes (How Skynet knows about Kyle Reese?) - too much action - no character developing - Pirates-of-Caribbean-like scenes (Marcus hitting surface of lake) - no emotions over story - stupid Skynet, no base security, no trap for Connor - cliché ending with nonsense heart transplantation - useless Common character - universe perverts - Connor is not a leader - Arnold cameo is far from perfect - Machines can't kill humans! - PG-13, no blood, vulgar etc. - bad editing, many scenes are cut in the middle (especially when Marcus entering city)This is not a Terminator movie. It's still McG movie with PG-13 failures. Too much dumb-action sequences. I wanted to dark s-f movie with some action, but not this. I hope that T5 will be better and not with McG in credits... And of course with better script.",3,0,2,11 June 2009
The Happening," Mr.s Shyamalan should be on retirement...
","This movie sucks a lot! Whole idea is OK, but script and plot suffers from idiotic dialogs and poor acting. For example - Wahlberg and Deschanel run through the field and then Mark starts dialog about how he bought a syrup in shop! Geeeez, who wrote that? Also actors (and Zooey) makes some stupid faces all the time wrinkling forehead and gets eyes out of the moon.Also there are some scenes without sense like nature affecting on one person (but Wahlberg certified that nature attacks groups) and D-movie like ending.Shyamalan should go on retirement because after Unbreakable (which was solid) gave us some cliché, underperformed dramas...",2,2,5,7 July 2008
