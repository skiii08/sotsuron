Skyfall," Skyfall Review
","First off, loved it.Skyfall's story is a marked improvement on Quantum of Solace's sloppy pacing. The dialogue scenes are a joy to watch play out with such a great cast and successfully integrate well-worn bond tropes with scenes that carry some emotional weight. The action scenes are stunning to watch in the varied locales on display and have been plotted and storyboarded with precision keeping them visually comprehensible and maintaining that sense of realism that is missing when action is shot through close ups and shaky cam.The acting is pretty great across the board with Craig giving another turn as a damaged (although somewhat funner) Bond and new additions Whishaw, Fiennes and Harris all seem right at home within the 007 universe. Judi Dench is a particular joy to watch this time round with her character given significantly more weight than in previous films. But most impressively Javier Bardem delivers one of the most memorable bond villains ever in my opinion, and the long continuous shot in which he first appears was a fantastic character introduction.Previous Mendes collaborators Thomas Newman and Roger Deakins also benefit the film greatly with Newman providing an electronic score that ups the tension and cool of the scenes where present. Deakins comes as perhaps the films greatest asset providing beautiful cinematography from scene to scene, always finding visually captivating compositions to present the inspired location choices. A particular sequence set in a Shanghai skyscraper is a masterwork with changing neon lighting influencing the scene's feel from frame to frame, as well as being stunning to look at.Without getting into spoilers, I can see how some people would have problems with the films third act where much of the story's momentum comes to a halt. Also Albert Finney's character was clearly intended for another storied Scottish actor and that absence is more than noticeable. But whatever damage the finale does to the film is minimal compared to everything that has come before.After the disappointing Quantum of Solace, Skyfall comes as an impressive return to form for the 007 franchise and manages to become one of the best action films of recent years.",8,2,9,28 November 2012
Life of Pi," good movie about a kid stuck in a boat with a tiger
","Life of pi is a very good film, What Ang Lee does visually using 3D and the surroundings are amazing throughout and a testament to his confidence behind the camera. The themes of religion and story telling and all that hoo hah are presented well enough and I had a lot of moments where I was all like 'this can be applied to my own life and stuff, man' so I'd be surprised if you walked away from this completely unaffected.The majority of the film that takes place upon the boat is incredibly well handled and often told through purely visual means without having a character speak. The computer-generated animals are also a marvel to watch and came about as close to seeming tangible as I've ever seen in a movie.One of my problems with the film is it's bookended by the grown up Pi relating his story to the shell of a journalist that presumably once contained a personality, and as far as existing to provide a basis for the narration it works, but it's a VERY obvious narrative tool.If you're looking for some competent awards season fare that raises some mildly interesting questions about faith and identity while also having some very life-affirming moments give this a watch. If not, I recommend you watch anything by David Cronenberg and feel violated in knowing you just saw what you just saw.",7,1,3,22 January 2013
Pacific Rim," A Darn Good Time at the Movies
","Within the opening 15 or so minutes Charlie Hunnam's voice-over establishes the reality of a future where monsters (the Kaiju) repeatedly invade earth, to stem this humans have created giant robots (Jaegers) to combat them in increasingly badass iterations. This opening does a great job in conveying the scope of a film which is big, not just regular big, but like, Jason Biggs in 1999 bigg. entering the cinema from a world where these events rarely occur is initially a lot to throw at the audience, but it's handled so effectively and without tongue in cheek that it quickly becomes a world I had a blast experiencing. Maybe it was the incredible effects shots of robot related destruction used as a throwaway shots, but what I think really sold the opening sequence and the film as a whole is the enthusiasm Del Toro clearly has for the story he's telling.The cast is essentially a rogues gallery of TV's better dramas playing variations on roles they've nailed in the past (see: Elba, Hunnam and Klattenhoff) and some inspired casting of It's Always Sunny's Charlie Day who, as should be expected provides some effective comedic relief. Added onto this the score comes courtesy of Ramin Djawadi who's masterful use of themes on Game of Thrones is carried over to this film for some great emotional cues and many a rad motif courtesy of Tom Morello on guitar.It's appropriate Del Toro has a Frankenstein adaptation lined up as a follow up project as Pacific Rim can at times can feel stitched together from all the sources of inspiration the film has. This comes from many areas such as Japanese manga, the personalities of the actors from previous films and the imagery of robots destroying buildings which transformers ran into the ground. But Del Toro succeeds time and time again at allowing these disparate elements to fit together believably by way of some very confident filmmaking. I could easily take issue with the oft hammy dialogue and macho relationships but where the film succeeds in other areas and revels in creativity trumps the dissatisfaction one could take from these scenes. I also found Hunnams character a tad lacking in charisma and internal conflict but whatever, it's not the end of the world. Oh wait, yes it is hahahahaÂ… The films successes go beyond its imagery and continued invention within battle scenes as the script is very economical when it comes to pacing. The films battle scenes are so engaging and exciting due to clearly established stakes present which left me devoid of the 'action fatigue' transformers loves to throw my way. And although the Kaiju battles seem to never be in short supply, the film essentially follows the rule of three when it comes to battle sequences and left me oh so satisfied.In conclusion, I give it points for being one of the funner summer blockbusters in recent memory, for being an original property and for its sheer tenacity to exist which all amount to what is just a darn good time at the movies.",8,492,825,11 July 2013
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo Review
","Having been underwhelmed by the original Swedish adaptation I was excited to see if Fincher could elevate the admittedly flawed source material to the extent that he has been able to in his past films. Fincher succeeds through his deft control of the production, managing to craft an absorbing mood and narrative that is engaging and compelling cinema, in lieu of the shortcomings of the novel.Jeff Cronenweth's cinematography captures the Swedish landscape just as beautifully as he handles the cubist architecture of the buildings and offices and how the characters interact in these spaces. This element improves on the original for in the lengthy exposition and moments where you're not entirely sure what the characters are talking about/researching, the images are still of a quality that you remain invested in what the film is trying to convey whether or not you understand it.The acting is fantastic across the board with even minor characters given memorable portrayals. Mara and Craig have a great chemistry on screen, and although I found the romance to come out of nowhere (as it does in the novel) it was handled well by both actors even if it does not seem realistic considering Salander's previous interactions with men. The lengthy epilogue suffers from a lack of tension since the mystery has been solved by this point, but because it is so well handled and the montage of Salander pulling of the heist is easy to follow, the scene is appreciably well handled even if seemingly tacked on.Despite the fact that the source material did not have a great deal of thematic depth, and the film as a result has little to read into other than the nihilistic vibe consistent across all of Fincher's efforts, it is memorable as a thrilling and exquisitely built ride, but a surface level ride nonetheless.",8,1,5,14 January 2012
Wreck-It Ralph," I enjoyed being hit in the face with this nostalgia wand of a film
","I found the conceit of the film to be quite brilliant as it set the stage for some very cool video game throwbacks which I absolutely loved. However I was often puzzled that these fairly obscure references were used in a film which employed some pretty juvenile humour (in particular when the Sarah Silverman character was involved).The look of the film is pretty spectacular with each world rendered successfully in different video game styles, in particular the candy land sequences which (here it comes) made me want to eat candy.The things that keep it from greatness are the usual trappings of an animated film with this budget, whereby they must hit all the necessary emotional beats and hold back from doing anything too narratively unusual. But in spite of this straightforwardness I did find myself a tad choked up in certain parts, so for what it set out to do the story's solid.Wreck It Ralph is an enjoyable romp with many a fun video game reference to be had and an economical and successful story that I can't imagine not appealing to many people, so check it out and be entertained, but not challenged.Also Ralph gets hit the face twice when the Rihanna song begins playing, I choose not to take this as a coincidence.",8,5,6,6 January 2013
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," An enjoyable, warbling and bloated return to middle earth
","(reviewed from a 24 fps 2D screening) Some things are pretty indisputable about the Hobbit: the story has been stretched (for the sake of Commerce) to the point of breaking and for a pretty lean novel, it feels bloated and tangential. But for the most part I quite enjoyed this return to middle earth, admittedly from a lot of LOTR nostalgia.When the Hobbit works it works because of Peter Jackson's sure grasp of how he wants to present middle earth and it's characters. Visually the film looks amazing and the use of New Zealand as a stand in for middle earth is once again fantastic. The action is staged brilliantly and I'd go so far as to say Jackson should be mentioned alongside Scorsese when speaking in terms of camera movement. Also the great cast and memorable characters ensures there's usually something compelling about any given dialogue scene.Where the Hobbit doesn't work is where it feels so intent on elongating the material to add unnecessary elements and incorporate material from Tolkien's The Simarillion, which amount to making the film feel episodic. There were moments when we'd return to Bilbo and I'd forget he was even in the film (this cannot be wholly contributed to my early onset Alzheimers) and scenes that went on for 5 or so minutes but could have been expressed in a few simple lines of dialogue (the dwarfs eating Bilbo's food was pretty unbearable).But I cannot deny that I relished the opportunity to revisit middle earth and although my opinion of the film will probably diminish in subsequent viewings, watching orcs get beheaded is my definition of entertainment.",7,5,13,27 December 2012
Behind The Candelabra," Fully fleshed out biopic and character study
","If this is indeed Steven Soderbergh's last film (as he's gone on record saying) then that'll just be a darn shame because he's one of the few working directors that can turn out films of this standard at a rate of twice a year.Behind the Candelabra focuses on the life of Liberace (Michael Douglas) for the six years that he spent with his lover Scott Thurston played by Matt Damon. With the exception of the scenes of Liberace performing in Vegas the film isn't too showy and instead uses extended bouts of dialogue and relationship troubles between the characters to propel the film. This works to a degree as Douglas is doing some fantastic work here and the way Matt Damon evolves throughout the film is a testament to how good of an actor he really is. That being said there are moments where the film sags and its episodic nature grows a tad grating throughout the run time.I can see why the film had to be this long however as it aims to track how the relationship grew out of one based on power and control on the part of Liberace and began to fester after years of this dynamic, but surely there could have been a scene of drug taking or plastic surgery that could have been cut.As someone who wasn't at all familiar with the story of Liberace I found this film to entertain and enlighten on the subject of the Las Vegas entertainment industry and the closeted homosexuality of public figures during this time. So if you're in the mood for a slow burn character study of some larger than life figures while also witnessing the swansong of Soderbergh (for the time being) check it out.I still don't know what a candelabra is.",7,0,2,21 August 2013
Elysium," Enjoyable action romp/blunt force political allegory
","Elysium is the second feature length effort from Neill Blomkamp whose District 9 was a brilliant debut that covered many of the socio- political issues present in Elysium with a dose more subtlety. It must be said that Elysium is never boring as music cues and startling shots of the space station thingy and an overpopulated Los Angeles do a great job of establishing a back story sans dialogue. However, as effective with pacing as the film can be it has an over-reliance on musical cues during emotional moments and a heady use of metaphors in the dialogue that don't give the audience much credit when it comes to connecting the dots.My gripes with the heavy handedness aside, projects such as this that set out to insert messages about other political issues such as overpopulation within the confines of a studio system is something worth commending. These issues may often fall by the wayside as the focus is often drawn to fetishizing the action into making it look as cool as possible, but the action never fully dilutes the political messages and remain quite cool to watch.I wasn't a huge fan of the gutter mouthed Sharlto Copley as the antagonist who's over the top nature and South African accent shone a light on how bad some of his dialogue was. Added to this I found his dialogue so riddled with swear words that my fragile ears could simply not permit it outside of the context of a dockworker stubbing his toe.Matt Damon's performance was one of my personal favourite's I've seen from him and the film had me pondering issues and stuff during and after the run time which is damn fine value for $12 on a student discount. I'd recommend seeing Elysium, but there's a lingering sense that it could have been executed far better in some easy to fix areas.",6,2,4,16 August 2013
Les MisÃ©rables," Les MisÃ©rables Review
","I don't enjoy musical theatre.That being said I found Les Mis to be quite engaging from a technical standpoint. Between Tom Hooper's lively camera-work and the choice to have the actor's singing live on set, the musical becomes more dynamic which is the major advantage a film adaptation has over the stage. Where I take issue with the film is that it's shot as though it were a gritty, small-scale drama, which just feels aesthetically awkward when being used for these grandiose musical sequences and large scale 'emoting'.Another problem I found is it feels restrained to the vision of the musical and much of what is taking place on camera isn't appropriate to the medium. By this I mean instances where instead of having a character act out what they are feeling, they instead sing it, which makes sense on the stage but is unnecessary with film where you have full view of a characters face. Also, Russell Crowe seemed to be struggling quite a bit with the high notes and the production designer went a bit overboard in the sewer escape sequence, by putting so much poo on screen at one time even I had to stop and observe 'that's a bit too much poo'.So as much as I liked the technical aspects I didn't really enjoy the story the film was telling and found its balance between realism and a heightened sense of reality off-putting. Although there were a bunch of 15-year-old kids crying during the emotional scenes at my screening, so maybe it was really good and I'm wrong, you decide!",5,9,22,23 December 2012
Zero Dark Thirty," gr8 film
","It's been said numerous times elsewhere but zero dark thirty really feels like it should have been made 20 years from now. The film employs an objective observational style to some highly contentious and prescient issues still at the forefront of America's political and military conscious.This film seems to have jazzed everyone off with the conservative right proclaiming it as pro-Obama propaganda and many on the left stating that the way in which torture is depicted is dangerous and morally wrong to even be shown. That first point I won't touch on but I've read pieces from people such as Alex Gibney who I respect highly attacking the film for depicting torture as more effective than it actually is. I strongly disagree with this as no effective information is ever really yielded from the interrogations, and although there is a greater statement to be made about the wider reality of 'advanced interrogation techniques' yielding extremely little and unreliable information on high ranking members of Al-Qaeda, that simply isn't the story the film is telling. In fact I feel these sidebars and themes that get pushed into the background in the hunt for Bin Laden heightens the drama on display showing the lows a country was willing to sink to in its hunt for revenge (I'm not opposed to him getting capped, rather delighted actually).The film is divided into 4 sections and all offer different yet important aspects of the whole operation while remaining a cogent whole. My personal favourite scene in the film is a conversation between Mark Strong and Stephen Dillane discussing the statistical probabilities involved in the assault compared to those that justified the invasion of Iraq which is masterwork, mad props to Mark Boal on that one.I feel the movie kind of negates the need for other films on this subject matter through its exhaustive attention to detail for the entirety of the 11 or so years it takes place in and should be viewed as a reliable text on a lot of what America meant to the world for this period in history.Quickly, Jessica Chastain and pretty much the entire cast are awesome, the night raid sequence is tense as all hell, the score is quickly becoming a personal favourite (if a little derivative of Desplat's past work on Syriana) and the direction and writing meld superbly. I wish Kathryn Bigelow was up for a second Oscar on this one but I'm sure this film will be remembered for many more years than whatever does win for 2012.",9,6,13,19 February 2013
