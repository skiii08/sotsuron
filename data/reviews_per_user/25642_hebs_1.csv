The Sound of Music," Julie Andrews kicks ass
","The Sound Of Music is my favourite movie of all time and I think that it is a must see!!The whole cast are fantastic but Julie Andrews kicks ass! She doesn't care what she looks like in the film and her acting is superb. It is the best film of all time. The thing that impressed me was how well they all sang. The end always gets me in tears and I can't help it, Everyone thinks I'm mad.This film relies on the songs for 70% of it's success, Rogers and Hammerstein did the best job. This is without doubt the best adaptation of Maria von Trapp's story and if you have to do one thing before you die, you must watch it!!",10,3,11,18 May 2004
