Skyfall," Skyfallen flat on Its face. Don't believe the hype.
","I was eagerly awaiting Skyfall and after watching it I am totally disappointed. I was really pleased with Daniel Craigs Bond in Casino Royal and Quantum as he had been brought up to date and gave Bourne a run for his money.Why oh why was Mendes given this, this is not a reboot its a reversion to the 60's Bond but brought into modern day. The cheesy retro theme just does not work unless you are a hardcore Bond fan. I mean come on, komodo dragons eating the bad guy...I just didn't get it, was this a stand alone homage to the Bond films? Picky I know, but Why would the new Bond drive round in Sean Connery's Aston Martin? There is only one Bond therefore that car wouldn't have been created with the ejecter seat etc. There is hardly any action when broken down into the sum of its parts, don't expect the high octane fight scenes of Casino Royal/Quantum because they simply aren't there.The ending is rushed and disappointing. The film is average at best and in my view taken a step back. The only saving grace was Javier Bardem, without him the film would have skyfallen flat.I've given it a four as its a film that Bond fans of yester year will enjoy due to the nostalgic references. But take that away and its no Casino Royal, and I feel it's taking Bond in the wrong direction.It begs the question film critics, what your reviews had been had it not been the Bond franchises 50th birthday.",4,38,73,4 November 2012
