Spartacus," Spartacus vs Gladiator: conflicting ideologies
","SPARTACUS dir by Stanley Kubrick based on blacklisted writer, Howard Fast's 1952 novel Historian Durant was an adviser.Won Oscars for best supporting actor and best cinematography. Amazing that it is in many ways a better film than Ridley's 'Gladiator' which won best pic of 2001, yet Spartacus was made 41 years ago. It is an epic look at the underbelly of the Roman Empire, with allegorical overtones about the McCarthy era House Un-American Activities Committee. Like 'Gladiator', there is a struggle between the aristocratic class and the senate. In an obvious scene, the patrician aristocrat, Glaucus, holds up a list of names of those to be arrested. The leading senator himself is eventually brought by force from his home to the senate to listen to the aristocrat's demands.Impressive scenes throughout, without aid of computer technology. Kubrick gives us a vision of the carnage after a major defeat of the slave army. Hundreds of remaining male slaves are crucified along the highway leading back to Rome. A romantic plot is overlaid on this by Hollywood, as usual. The dismal tragedy of the execution of Spartacus is mollified by the idea that his infant son will live in freedom. This was to suggest, prophetically we can see today, that the future generation of Americans would be free from the paranoid injustice of McCarthyism. Where Kubrick's is ideologically superior to the new Gladiator is that it dramatizes the oppressed dignity of the working class against the corrupt decadence of the owners. But in 'Gladiator', the hero is a military general, defeating the barbarians at first. He is an imperialist who dreams of private life, and his story unfolds as an individualist. He does not inspire an uprising of slaves who seek their liberty. Instead he inspires admiration for his individual struggle for vengeance. It is a simple revenge plot of justified violence, parading its own hypocrisy openly. The film pretends to be critical of Roman blood-lust, which creates violence as a spectacle of entertainment; yet 'Gladiator' itself won the prize precisely by representing a spectacle of violence (or to be more accurate, it won by deploying this hypocrisy of glamorizing violence while moralizing against it--the most common technique in movies today). In contrast, 'Spartacus' represents much justified violence on the part of the slave uprising, but it leaves us with a distaste for the struggle.",9,6,10,9 February 2005
Apocalypse Now," Heart of Darkness
","If you're looking for a masterpiece, read the short novel this is based upon: Joseph Conrad's _Heart of Darkness_. The film is merely OK in comparison. I like the idea of translating Conrad's anti-imperialism from the Congo of 100 years ago to Vietnam in the '60s. The Idea is relevant, once we look through the alibi, the self-serving excuses, and the supposed idealism of the US taking up a former French colony after they cut and ran from the independence fighters there. But the film's ponderous ambition tends to become bombastic at times, rather than the bottomless ambiguity of Conrad's novella.",7,2,3,1 December 2005
"Good Night, and Good Luck."," Journalists should see it
","George Clooney directed & wrote, re: true story of Edward R. Murrow as lone journalist up against McCarthy's witch hunt and American security paranoia. Timely stuff, straightforward, no hanky-panky Hollywood fluff. Clooney turns out to be an interesting and informed guy. It was nominated for everything, but won only lesser awards for cinematography (filmed in stark black & white), but it did win more recognition overseas in Australia and Europe. One only hopes that American journalists watched it! Perhaps many reporters were indeed inspired by this timely reminder of the heroic Murrow, since it appears that the media in 2005 began to 'speak truth to power' and to openly question the executive decisions being made -- e.g., about the flooding of New Orleans, the occupation of Iraq, the sudden loss of habeas corpus rights, the extraordinary renditions of kidnapped civilians out to secret prisons where torture is routine and legal trials are nonexistent, about the distorted and fabricated 'facts' to persuade Americans into the war, and more recently against the proposed strikes on Iran. That's an incredible list of journalistic duties, and compared with what Murrow was up against, we live in a darker and more disturbing time. Clooney knows this, has said as much, and ought to be thanked for reminding us of Murrow's courage, now needed doubly.",9,3,5,3 February 2007
