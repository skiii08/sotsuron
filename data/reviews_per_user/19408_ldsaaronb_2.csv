The Sound of Music," Fantastic from beginning to end!
","This movie has been a part of my life since I was a little kid back in the 80s. I remember my great-grandmother and my grandmother watching it and it always had an impact on me.I love Maria and how she passionately stands up for what's right in her innocent way. The romance is also great. There are a few scenes in this movie that I am powerless during and I always cry, especially the redemption scenes of the father.Good stuff!",10,2,2,14 April 2020
Avengers: Endgame," Great way to wrap up an epic story
","I feel that the MCU is the greatest storytelling of all time. Nothing has ever been this complex yet still easy to follow and so entertaining in the history of cinema. The visuals are amazing and the drama is fantastic.Endgame put a perfect cap on the first few phases and provided a great launching forward for the next few. Awesome, awesome...could watch it over and over again and not get tired of it.",10,0,7,14 April 2020
