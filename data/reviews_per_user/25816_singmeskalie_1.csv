Walk the Line," Actors
","Joaquin Phoenix plays an amazing Johnny Cash. Sometimes you forget its an actor and not really johnny. His mannerisms are almost perfect, you can truly just feel the pain from johnny cash in his eyes. Reese Witherspoon does a good job too, but she has a sort of whiny accent that June carter doesn't have. This movie is an wonderful portrayal of johnny cash's life. However, the movie is based only on childhood up until he marries June, and not up into old age. The songs turned out great, the actors/actresses remade all the songs and sung them themselves, which worked out perfect. Again, you can't tell the difference sometimes between Joaquin and johnny, but Reese didn't do as good of a job, but it is still great!",10,3,7,20 November 2005
