The Ring," Excellent movie!
","Though I can't compare this to the Japanese version since I've never seen it, this movie on it's own is quite great. The soundtrack is also interesting, containing a creepy tonality but fast paced tempo which provides the feeling that the viewer is unraveling a mystery. This movie has a few jumps, but what makes it great is the creepy atmosphere (greyish tint the whole time) and the psychologically induced terror. I imagine this movie was scarier when the tape format was more prominent, but this film is still worth watching. The Japanese version of this movie really created what most people today consider Japanese horror, and the American version is no slouch. A must-see for anyone interested in horror or mystery!",9,1,1,6 August 2012
Insidious," Falls flat
","Some things in this movie were so well done. The ghosts at times could be very terrifying not just in making the viewer jump, but also just scary to look at. The main characters are really well developed and all have their own personality. Unfortunately, the plot bores the viewer to death in the second half. I was incredibly disappointed in the direction this movie took and I felt like from second half on I really had no interest but for the movie to end. It's a shame, because the first half really had some scary moments and it was gradually scarier and scarier. What I enjoyed about the scary scenes was that I felt as if they had more substance than most movies. They were not the enjoyable but cheap thrills of the Paranormal Activity series but rather strong visually and psychologically. Though I will never understand why the movie took a turn for the worse, I do think the movie is still worth seeing and it is perhaps someone else's cup of tea more than it is mine.",6,0,0,6 August 2012
The Dark Knight," Woah
","This movie is certainly a behemoth amongst action movies and in my mind the greatest superhero movie of all time. Not only does this movie question morality in a way others don't but questions what a superhero really is. Heath Ledger gave an utterly amazing performance and one that will be remembered by audiences for a long time. The tone of this movie is creepy and dark, darker than any other superhero movie I have ever seen. Christian Bale's performance of Batman was also brilliant as he makes his rendition of Batman truly his own. I wonder if the next generation of Batman movies will be able to top this. I really have trouble finding flaws in this film. Anyone who enjoys movies will enjoy this, it really is just that good.",10,0,3,7 August 2012
