E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," If you don't like this film, then something is wrong with you.
","I hate you Steven Speilberg.You're one of the few directors who can make a movie that after all of these years, still makes me cry.E.T. is a true classic that stands the test of time. It's a movie about a boy who's parents are divorced, and befriends a loveable alien who is lost after his family leave without him. Both go through a change in each other's personality and life, as the boy (Named Elliot.) must learn to share his new friend with others, while making sure his Mother (Played EXCELLENTLY by Dee Wallace Stone, as usual when she acts in films.) doesen't know that he is keeping that special alien with him. Sure, there are some disturbing scenes, but the good outweighs the bad here. When this came out, I was only 4 years old, and it has truly affected me. I was amazed by this film when I was young, and still am now. To me, this is the greatest film of all time.Yes, I like this more than Star Wars, The Godfather, Titanic, and other films that have achieved greatness. Why? Because it affected me in such a way back then, and still does now-a-days.I still cry when I watch this movie. I'll admit it. I still cry. Especially when E.T. becomes sick and is being experimented on. It is just such an emotional film, that stands the test of time better than any other movie could.Recommended: Forever.RATING: **** of ****",10,20,36,5 May 2004
Shrek 2," With how much commercial advertising and hype this film has gotten, this has expectations of being as great as The Shawshank Redemption...
","It's sad that most Disney sequels turn out to be lackluster films, with Toy Story 2 being the only Disney film to actually be better than the first. But can Shrek 2 do the same?Sorry to spoil, but it doesen't.Now that Shrek (Mike Myers) and Fiona (Cameron Diaz) are married, they have returned to their swamp to find that Donkey (Eddie Murphy) has  been taking care of the place. They get an invatationto have a celebration at Fiona's old home in the land that's Far Far Away. When they get there, Fiona's father (John Cleese) and Shrek start to feud. When Fiona starts looking at old things in her room, she starts to cry which prompts The Fairy Godmother to enter in. Apparently, The Fairy Godmother's son Prince Charming was supposed to save Fiona, but he came there too late, since Shrek had already saved her, and he finds The Wolf. Now, the Godmother and The King make a plan to have Prince Charming to fall for Fiona. After a few mix-ups and things involving a new friend for Shrek and Donkey (Antonio Banderas, in a movie saving role), the gang all are able to stop The Fairy Godmother's plan, which involves The King to save his daughter Fiona, and turn into a frog.Why this film wasn't rated PG-13, is beyond me. TOO much sexually implied humor was in this film. The worst coming from The Gingerbread finding out that Pinnochio wears a pink thong. There isn't much kiddie humor, which is why this is NOT a kids film at all. Most kids, well, atleast the ones I know, wanted to see this film for COMEDY THAT IS AIMED TOWARDS KIDS. There isn't any in this film. It's more of a film for us adults rather than children. THAT'S why I don't like this film as much as the first.The humor is dry, the movie never gets fully interesting, and there's too much sexual humor. Sounds like a teen movie to me.Unless you're over 13, don't take your kids to see this movie.Not recommended.RATING: ** out of ****",Null,0,1,19 May 2004
A Nightmare on Elm Street," Great movie!
","Hard to believe, this movie is still this good and scary after all of these years. This is a movie about a teenage girl named Nancy, who is getting haunted in her dreams at night by a mythical creature named Freddy Krueger (Who can hate the guy? Seriously, he's a movie icon.), who is getting revenge for being killed by the townspeople in the forties. The reason to this, is because Freddy Krueger used to kidnap and kill children, and was not put in jail for lack of evidence.Everyone is working hard in this film. The two people who shine the most though, are John Saxson and Heather Langenkamp. Both seemed like they were having fun in their roles. Let's not forget Robert Englund, for his fantastic performance as Freddy.The gore isn't what people will truly expect. Sometimes, the gore and deaths are funny, in a Dead-Alive kind of way. But other times, the scenes are amazingly scary, and the fact that Nancy's PARENTS were two of the mob that killed people, make this a shock. Nancy's alcoholic mother is a creep in the film, and is sometimes weirder than Freddy. Don't forget about Johnny Depp getting sucked into the bed! Rating: **** (out of ****.)",10,0,0,15 December 2004
