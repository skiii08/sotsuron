Ford v Ferrari," Loved this amazing story
","A few reviews on here giving this movie less than 5 stars which is simply pathetic on their part, this movie deserves 5 stars just for the cinematography, I gave it an extra 4 stars for the acting alone, its not a perfect 10 but had they concentrated more on telling the story from shelby & miles perspective it certainly would have been 10/10.
Reviewers giving this low marks obviously missed the point of the movie or more so they didn't understand that this movie was telling the story of shelby & miles, the Ford vs ferrari story is just the background story, a story that is firmly cemented in the annals of history.
Matt Damon & Christian bale are fantastic as the lead characters in a movie about two incredible people.",9,2,3,29 December 2019
X-Men Origins: Wolverine," Another stupid pile of garbage
","What a lacklustre unimaginative stupid pile of junk movie, the stupidest origin story & use of Wolverine, Sabertooth & deadpool ever, with Wolverine displaying none of his unique abilitys apart from his claws & sabertooth prancing around like a dog looking absolutely ridiculous & the worst depiction of Deadpool possible.
As if all that idiocy wasn't enough they add the pointless appearance of Gambit, a young Cyclops & Emma frost & a bunch of random mutants along with an overly effeminate looking proffesor X with a full face of make up by Ru Paul.
There are not enough expletives to describe this pile of stinking BS, Benioff & Woods should have had the good sense to read a few x-men comics to at least get an idea of who these characters are & what they are capable of.
As a Wolverine movie this sucks big time, as a standalone action movie its weak, boring & unimaginative, stupid set action pieces & zero character development & with a plot & storyline worse than any cheap comic book.
X-men origins, Wolverine has as much entertainment value as a rotten tomato.",2,0,0,26 June 2020
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Star tripe, how to ruin a franchise the j j Abrams way
","Never has so much money been spent on so much garbage.
Take the best trio of the franchise copy pretty much everything chuck tons of dollar at it & voila pure rubbish.
No amount of cgi can make up for the stupid plot & ridiculous storyline.
Abrams ruins another franchise by turning it into childish garbage",3,51,89,11 January 2020
Joker," Clown Prince of Comedy
","What a god awful mess.
I've given this a 4 because a drama costing 55 million should be a damn sight better, had 'joker' not been the premise of this movie I would have given it a higher rating, I'll explain, this is not the DC Joker, this is a story of a mentally ill man, borderline sociopathic and living the most drab & dreary life possible who then descends into madness & becomes a full psychopath, we get barely any build up or development of this asides from 'Arthur' being beaten up by a bunch of kids then by a trio of drunk yuppies but we get endless scenes of him agonising over his boring dreary life, now as is its good but nothing more than that, Joaquin Phoenix is brilliant & will most definitely get the Oscar for his performance but this movie is then spoiled by the pointless references & inclusions of the Wayne family, its just enough tidbits thrown in to try to authenticate it as existing in the batman universe, there isn't homeless people shuffling around the streets to show how bad life is, no yuppies partying showing how good life is for the elite, nothing to show the huge chase between the rich & the poor & so nothing to justify the rioting in the streets.
all these reviews praising it for it being dark & dreary, bleak & depressing, what is wrong with these people, this is not a tour de force of cinema, all of you stop with the 'oh this is like real life' 'best DC movie ever' the story is completely garbage, the origin of the joker, total BS.
so basically this is 'The king of comedy' story line with senseless murders & pointless riots & zero enjoyment.
So Todd Phillips states 'this is not the joker you know' he is definitely right with that but if this is his version of the joker separate from the comics or previous films then why include the Wayne family & why include an iconic scene from the comics which was also the scene recreated in the Tim Burton Batman movie.
The one thing that made the joker character so interesting was his mystery, Tim Burton almost ruined that with his brief origin of the joker, Jared leto almost ruined the character with his sleazy portrayal but Christopher Nolan's idea to keep the jokers origin a mystery & just allow heath ledger to develop the character his way was shear genius.
This film would have been better had it left out all the joker references, it would have stood out on its own, but to pass this off as the origin of the joker is quite simply the joke itself, shame on all of you involved, when you take such an iconic character you have an obligation to do the character justice & you failed, this film only stands out because of the incredible performance of its star",4,5,11,13 November 2019
