United 93," One of the most powerful film i have seen......
","Fist of all let me just say that i am not an American ,and therefore probably don't feel the same level of Patriotism as some of the American viewers, i have to admit that watching this film does provoke some strong feeling in me.What i like about this film is the fact that there are no cheesy line, gimmicks, or glorified Americanise (see independence day). All there is is the director detailing a event as it happen to the best of our knowledge, showing us how a group of stranger banded together to survived and draw courage from each other to try to come out of a difficult situation. And i have to admit, listening to the passengers making call to say goodbye to their love ones brings a few tears to my eyes.A good movie is one that makes you think after you walk out of the cinema, and i think this movie does that to me. Even now i still got this question in my head.... If god forbid, this ever happens to me, would i have the courage and do what these men and women do?",9,2,5,12 May 2006
Cloverfield," Well.........hard to say about this one
","Is this a good film? This is a hard question to answer for this film.First of all, i have to admit i was hooked by the trailer, and cant wait for the actual film. As i come out of the cinema, i was thinking, do i want to buy the DVD for this.... probably not, and seeing it with 5 mates, the opinion is divided 3:3...So i broke down the Pros and Cons of the film for you to decide for yourselves Pro: The filming techeque and the story line is good, put you in the middle of the action, and in within a short while, you do feel like you are running with the actors and in the middle of the action.The extras around you did a great job and make you sense the panic, and you do start think ' oh i wont do this if i am in their shoes' There is a few scene where you are like looking at the 9/11 documentary while you are on ground level.THIS IS NOT A CHEAP GOZZILA KNOCK OFF... it runs in a completely different storyline.CON: now I am not one who NEED every details explain, but i would at least like SOME. and yet you get none. The only certaintity you know is what is the fate of the main character. There are more questions than answers with this film. like where did the thing comes from etc...why do people die from bite? You can just feel that a Cloverfield 2 is in the pipeline.There are some stupid things that these characters did which you goes ' you deserve to die because you are stupid' like.... going in to the subway tunnel without thinking getting a torch? Also running around with a crowbar, but hey this is USA, surely there is a gun somewhere?",6,0,1,3 February 2008
