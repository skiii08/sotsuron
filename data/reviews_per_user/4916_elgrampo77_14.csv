10 Cloverfield Lane," Surprisingly good
",After seeing the first and the third Cloverfield movie did not expect this one to be that good. Although the first 30-45 minutes might seem long sometimes the movie really accelerates from the half on and offers nice acting and some good tension and twists.,8,0,0,1 July 2019
Darkest Hour," Superb acting...
",...combined with the interesting story around Churchill's ascend to power in the time of the siege of DÃ¼nkirchen. With some more dynamics and maybe a bit shorter duration would have rated it even higher.,8,2,2,7 November 2019
Knives Out," Nice
",Good old fashioned who was it movie with some nice plot surprises and funny acting.,8,0,2,13 May 2020
Concussion," Great acting!
","I like American football but would not go that far to call myself a fan. Nevertheless a very interesting and well acted film about a huge scandal in US sports history. If even half of it is true, the NFL should be ashamed of how it treated its players...we are not in Rome anymore, this is sports.",8,0,0,8 May 2019
Cloverfield," Would have given it even more stars
","If the First 20 mins were not so annoying. Other than that a really interesting, tense and entertaining movie - at least for fans of Godzilla vs. Blair witch project.",8,0,0,29 June 2019
Ready Player One," Great reminisce of many pop culture aspects
","Being a kid from the 1980s you just have to give a good rating. The whole movie feels just right. But even without that aspect, a very descent storybook, acting and effects.",8,0,0,11 October 2019
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Probably the best of the latest trilogy
",Of course every piece of the story has more or less been recycled from one of the other 8 movies - the good versus evil plot just does not allow more at some point of time. But the moment you accept it and don't dwell in the good old times it is one of the best movies in 2019. Lovable characters and a quite OK end of the Skywalker saga. Let's see if this was the last one with ray...,8,3,6,24 December 2019
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Maybe I did not get something...
",...but this was plain boring. Had to turn off after 40 mins of exactly zero happening.,1,4,9,24 June 2020
1917," Basically a perfect movie
","Great plot, superb acting and camera. Good music. Just don't expect 2 hours full of war battle action - that is not the purpose or the focus of the movie. But rather to tell a story about two men on a desperate mission and the consequences tied to that.",10,10,15,24 January 2020
The King," Great movie
","Might not be historically fully correct but great actors and plot. Particularly the battle scene was great as it shows that the war has nothing noble or heroic in it, it is dirty, painful and tragic. Really good movie",8,3,4,29 March 2020
Invincible," A feel-good sports movie
","Of course it is not a Oscar Level script or performance but after watching it you just have to feel good.
Mark Wahlbergs acting is well suited for the figure he is depicting.",7,2,2,8 May 2019
Joker," A perfect movie
","Great acting, great plot and suspense. Perfect building up of the story. You can basically feel what Arthur is going thru. And such a welcome change to all these superhero movies...hopefully this starts something off that would give us Batman & co movies different that current DC & marvel stuff that I actually do like. But would love to see similar, more darker, for adults only movies coming out on Batman etc.",10,3,5,12 April 2020
Midway," Quite entertaining....
","As any Emmerich movie. Apparently also more or less historically accurate. The effects were good.
You can still wonder how the Japanese managed to lose in spite of several advantages regarding the situation and the war material available.",7,0,1,18 May 2020
Annihilation," Some nice elements, but....
","...a lot of stuff that just does not make sense.The story was promising, some good actors were casted, some nice scenes & effects done - it started good and interesting but the plot holes are just too massive to be ignored.
We are talking about an unknown, obviously biologic life form that has been spreading for three years and the best the world greatest superpower can do, is to send small team in without any biohazard protection or similar? C'mon, I would have driven into this thing in a tank - at least then you don't have to care about alligators and bears ;-)I know it SciFi but a little more realism concerning our approach to a new lifeform would have been of benefit for this movie.....",5,1,1,31 March 2019
