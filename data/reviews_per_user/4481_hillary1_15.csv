The Blair Witch Project," Lame
","Whether or not you liked this movie seems to be based on how easily you can park your brain outside. Personally, I thought it was cheesy, over-the-top and just plain lame. There really was nothing scary about it. Screaming and running around substitute for dialogue and acting. Disappointing? You bet. Don't bother. Go see a good horror flick like 'Signs' or 'Hallowe'en.'",1,18,36,17 January 2003
Se7en," Wanted to, but...
","I really wanted to like this movie. I saw it long after everyone else did, and, though I knew it was gross and have a somewhat weak stomach, I also love stylish thrillers. I was disappointed (I know it was all for effect, but aside from everything else this movie gives a whole new dimension to the concept of rain and was distracting more than anything for me). It was like I was watching two different movies unfold-brilliance from Morgan Freeman and Kevin Spacey, as you would expect, and yawning mediocrity from Brad Pitt and Gwyneth Paltrow, as you would also expect (the notion that she somehow captured the same statute for her asleep-at-the-wheel performance in 'Shakespeare in Love' as Meryl Streep did for 'Sophie's Choice' still torments me at night!) The ending was original and probably the reason most people seem to think it was a better flick than it was. Too much gore, too much rain, and too much Pitt-need I say more?",Null,2,4,13 June 2004
Shaun of the Dead," Over the top and very funny
","Since everyone in the world here has seen fit to describe the plot of this movie in excruciating detail, I'll skip all that and just let you know that this was the funniest movie I've seen in a long time. The understated, bemused reactions of Shaun and Ed to all that's going on around them at first ('Are they out there?' 'No...Oh, wait, there they are') sets the stage for life-and-death struggle against the undead (or,as they will be known in Reality TV,the 'Fun Dead') that will forever be remembered as Z-Day. There is no subtlety here-the zombies are everywhere and the noise is constant, which is one thing I might have changed. It gets quite tiring to watch all this activity over fully the last half of the film. Still, it's hilarious without being mean-spirited (even though folks being are being gobbled up and ripped apart throughout.) Who needs a superhero to save the world when we've got Shaun?",7,4,9,5 March 2005
Spider-Man 2," Too little
","All superheroes are tortured souls, torn between their yearning to fully join the human race and their overarching commitment to duty (kind of like the British Royal Family). Superman, Batman, the Hulk-all of them modern Shakesperean tragic heroes. Spidey's no different. You know, though, I didn't care too much for this movie, and I'll tell you why-at least half the reason you go to these flicks is to examine the villian. Most of the time, they're much more interesting (although not much different) than the hero. Driven by personal pain (see: Penguin, Joker, Darth Vader), they become an image what our hero could have become. Here, we actually have very little insight into the character of the villian, Doc Ock-who is actually being controlled by some mechanical arms. Yes, he lost his wife in the melee, but there's no character development, no real personalization of the war between he and Spiderman. It's just flat. And I don't really care about the relationship between Spiderman and MJ-part of the superhero's appeal is that he's always on the outside looking in, and there's usually a  beautiful woman, i.e., Lois Lane, who symbolizes that. I'm more interested in the relationship between Spidey and Harry, or Spidey and the world. Go back to the roots of superhero lore and the next installment should be much more entertaining.",5,1,2,31 July 2004
The Others," Creepy
","I thought this was quite a good movie, although not a top 250. It's more creepy than scary, in a very traditional way-huge, old house, constant darkness and fog, and servants who aren't quite what they appear to be. The whole film takes place either in the house or on the grounds, which makes it somewhat visually tiring but also pretty effective. There are some loose ends which don't exactly get tied up-where is her husband? Clearly he knows what happened even if his wife does not yet('I asked them about that day...' or words to that effect). You don't get as many clues along the way as you do in 'The Sixth Sense' and you get the feeling that they're all just going to stay there until infinitely, forever a young mother and two small children. It held my interest and I would recommend it.",Null,0,2,2 June 2004
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," Worth watching
","I am not one of those who bow to the temple of Stanley Kubrick. 'Eyes Wide Shut' was pathetic, and I've yet to understand what's behind the cult status of 'A Clockwork Orange.' I do like satire, though, and I did enjoy this movie. Peter Sellers is always worth watching, and the best scene in the movie is the (actually very long) telephone conversation with the drunk Soviet premiere, trying to tell him that the US has just accidentally launched a nuclear attack because one of the generals went...funny. Dr Strangelove himself was actually a little overdone although he had some great moments(how did a former Nazi become an American citizen?)George C. Scott's overzealous military officer could easily be transported over 40 years to our military today and fit right in (according to him, we're in competition for superiority with the Russians even in the mine shaft), though the enemy target has changed. Keenan Wynn, as 'Bat' Guano (get it?) has the best line in the film-'If you don't get the president, you'll have to answer to the Coca-Cola company!' A fate worse than death...",Null,0,1,4 October 2003
Top Secret!," Funny but not the best
","I saw this movie years and years ago-probably when it first came out, although I can't remember now-and just now saw it again. Let me say, this is a very funny movie most of the time, if you like stuff that's just plain ridiculous ('...and then we'll break away from the other cows...' ;winning a gunfire version of tic-tac-toe),but still, it doesn't measure up to the definitive ZAZ flick, the original 'Airplane!' Val Kilmer looks ridiculously young, with typical '80s hair, and shows a real comedic flair here-he probably should have stuck with comedy. He then wouldn't have gone in the tank with that colossal 'Island of Dr Moreau' disaster (or maybe that was a comedy?) Anyway, if you liked the Naked Gun and Airplane series, you'll like this one, too.",Null,0,1,20 November 2004
The Shining," Not King's book, but still...
","Being from Maine, I have a deep and abiding affection for Stephen King, although I'm not a great fan of his work and certainly not of movies based on his work. The menacing air and feeling of dread can't often easily be put to film, as 'Pet Semetary' and 'Christine' demonstrate. So, even though our favorite son might have been put off by this film, I think Kubrick did him a favor by altering some plot lines that might not have translated well to the screen-for example, the topiary; it probably would have just looked ridiculous on film. There are some horrid images in this movie-kids chopped up, blood running out of the walls, but for my money the most terrifying scene is when Wendy finds that her writer husband has barricaded himself, and threatened her, all the while writing the same words thousands and thousands of times (word has it that Kubrick actually sat down and typed these pages himself, which must have taken hours in the days before word processing!!) Shelly Duvall said she had to film this movie in a 'constant state of panic' and was exhausted at the end of the filming. You can see why.",Null,0,1,31 October 2004
Pearl Harbor," Not good
","The war scenes in this movie were spectacular and it's frightening to imagine what really happened that day. However, the 'love triangle' plot was unbelievably lame, and Ben Affleck, never my favorite, comes off as nothing but arrogant and self-serving and in the end seems smugly content that everything turned out so well. I did enjoy Josh Hartnett but he wasn't enough to save this windbag of a movie.",Null,0,1,17 February 2003
Independence Day," Lame but still...
","Completely over the top, the second half of the movie especially was just so entirely lame, the best part was when all the groupies on top of the building get blown away by the disgusted aliens. Data was also great, and the casting there was pretty inspired. Will Smith hasn't yet shown he can do better than this, and one of these days I'm going to have a heart attack watching Jeff Goldblum. But you know what? I liked it anyway. There's no accounting for tastes. I liked '1941' as well...",Null,1,4,6 December 2002
Moulin Rouge!," Ewan's cute, but...
","I liked parts of this movie but primarily it was an overprocessed Biggest Hits video. Nicole, a la Audrey Hepburn, can't sing a note but was apparently chosen for star appeal, and is miscast-this role calls for someone voluptuous, exotic, eccentric, and she looks like a dressed-up Barbie doll. Ewan McGregor does a fairly good job with a weak part (his character must be one of the dumbest human beings on earth). Jim Broadbent was very good as were some of the other supporting cast. However, when someone is dying of TB-it's called consumption for a reason-they can't usually spend their last few minutes dancing and singing under hot lights. I hate movies that do crap like that. Really kind of ruined the whole thing for me. If they wanted her to die, why not just push her over the balcony?",Null,0,1,4 April 2004
The Evil Dead," Oh my god
","I'd love to know why everyone posting on this site thinks this movie is so priceless. C'mon, people! It's stereotypically set in the dark in the middle of the woods, and anybody knows what happens in the dark in the middle of the woods, if you ever set around the fire at scout camp. Weird tapes wake up demons in the woods. Some idiot girl decides to go out into the woods to confront the demons and gets raped by a tree (yes, you read that right...there is no particular reason for this scene, by the way, except to give the obligatory T&A shot these movies are notorious for). The demons are not only out to rip out your innards, they are also determined to annoy the sh*t out of you before doing so. Otherwise, it's basically a whole lot of fake blood and strewn about body parts-not a bad thing in and of itself, but certainly does not elevate this to 'good movie' status. Don't bother, unless you have some kind of weird branch fetish.",1,59,104,18 March 2005
This Is Spinal Tap," My love gun's loaded and she's in my sights...
","I am of the belief that Christopher Guest is a genius, and 'This is Spinal Tap' is probably the best example of that. It's full of quotables-all I've got to do is look at my significant other and say, 'He's the patron saint of quality footwear' or, 'We're not going to do f-ing Stonehenge!' and we collapse in hysteria. Rob Reiner also made a lot of good movies after his days of playing the Meathead were over, and I've always missed him in other Guest productions. Also,the music in this film is actually pretty good; if you don't listen too closely to the lyrics and ignore the titles, you might almost think you were listening to a bona fide band! This was the first of the genre for Guest, although I'm willing to bet 'A Mighty Wind' will probably be the last. Although still very, very funny, it had kind of lost it's 'quirky' appeal by that time.",Null,0,2,5 July 2004
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Good bridge
","Everybody p*sses and moans about the quality of acting in these prequel films. Hello people! Was there ever a WORSE actor to grace the screen than Mark Hamill?? 'I'm Luke Skywalker, and I'm here to rescue you!' Hayden Christiansen would not be my choice to play Hamlet, and there are probably a lot of other young actors who could have more serviceably probed the depths of despair to which Anakin Skywalker falls, but he's certainly as good as Hamill was with a much more demanding role. I actually can see why Anakin would have grown disenchanted with the Jedi-they're portrayed as a snobby, elitist bunch of bureaucrats in all three films (the Sith really can't be any more annoying than these guys, they're like a bunch of IRS agents), not to mention incredibly WEAK-they all fall like dominoes the minute they are turned on. Where is all this incredible strength of the Force? What good is it if you can't count on it when the chips are down? The only Jedis really worth their mettle in this respect are Obi-Wan and Yoda. It serves them right that they all get wiped out. It's also hard to believe that emotional high-flying adventure seeker Obi-Wan Kenobi is transformed into the genteel, reclusive Ben Kenobi by the time A New Hope rolls around. Having said all that, I really enjoyed this film. It's of course visually appealing, and Anakin's manipulation from a desperate young man who wants to save his wife and his universe, who believes what he is doing is best for both, is quite powerful. Ian McDiarmid is the perfect Iago, the evil Sith Lord who really steals the show and gives a face and personality to the Emperor that we never saw in the original episodes. Without him, I don't think this film would have held my interest the way it did. Good movie, good bridge to the sequels. Star Wars is back.",7,1,3,28 May 2005
The Sixth Sense," If not for the ending...
","Possible spoilers This was a good movie because of the exploration of the characters, especially young Cole, not particularly because of the plot. There were suspenseful moments-high-drama type score and the shadows of ghosts before they actually appear-but I thought the kid's torment over being constantly haunted was rather simplisticly wrapped up, frankly, and can you really tape a spirit? The performances are all outstanding, especially Donnie Wahlberg in a very brief but pivotal role at the beginning, and HJ could teach seasoned 'celebrities' like Tom Cruise and Richard Gere a thing or two. It's the ending that makes people think this is a greater film than it is, though-I remember sitting there thinking, 'oh, MAN!! Why didn't I see that COMING??' Watching it a second time, you can't believe you were so dense.",8,0,1,27 April 2004
