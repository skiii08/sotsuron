The Ring," Definitely not average slasher-teen-horror flick
","Ring is a rather morbid movie with a simple yet original concept: An unmarked video tape that kills whoever watches it.Naomi Watts plays a reporter who(urged by her sister) investigates the sudden death of her niece. After snooping around a little, the clues lead her to a sinister tape viewed by the teens in a remote cabin. After watching the tape, she receives a warning that she has only '7 days' to live. As the countdown begins, the cynical reporter begins to believe in the curse of the tape and tries her best to break the curse.Though I've not seen the original Japanese version, I think this remake has the potential to draw in a lot of fans in the U.S. The story keeps the tension level up well enough as it takes you on a journey to discover the origin and meaning of the tape. However, the most important aspect of the story is that you never expect what will happen next and it leaves lot to your imagination. It isn't gory nor revolting but it does prove itself to be a horror flick that deserves some attention in the midst of the many teen-angst-slasher-horror movies that are so common these days. Kudos to Daveigh Chase, the best child character actor to come out of Hollywood since Haley Joel Osment.",8,0,0,17 October 2002
Donnie Darko," Replace Alice with Donnie Darko and you get a different type of 'wonderland'...
","Great movie! Donnie Darko probably deserved more than attention in 2001, but I hope more people will see it.The story in short: After a jet engine comes out of nowhere and crashes into his room, Donnie begins hallucinating. He begins to have chats with a creepy, giant rabbit. Severe depression? Psychosis? Is he dreaming? The suburban world in which Donnie lives in is nothing short of the world we have gotten accustomed to - bullies, the lonely overweight girl, the pretty new girl, the self-righteous school teacher who worships some narcissistic self-help guru. I'm not going to give away much more of the story, you have to see it in order to enjoy it. Really surreal and entertaining, the movie makes you wonder if he's going insane or if he's really discovered some 'other world'.",Null,0,0,17 October 2002
