Marie Antoinette," What else can I say...
","...that hasn't already been said? Historically inaccurate, poor scripting, poor dialogue, poor acting. While others have commented that it may not have been S. Coppola's intent to create a historically accurate piece, why create a historical piece if you don't plan to make some effort to represent the events accurately? And the musical score? It's great -- if the movie had taken place in the East Village in 1985.Kirsten Dunst's performance in the film is wooden at best. While she wasn't given much to work with in the way of dialogue and character development, still, her performance left much to be desired. Loved the visual aspect of the movie, but basically the movie is all style and no substance. All in all, the film is a pretentious waste of time and money.",1,14,22,26 June 2007
