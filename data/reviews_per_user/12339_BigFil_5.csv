Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Sigh.
","Well, here's my two cents.I thought The Phantom Menace was OK. Not great, not awful, just all right. A bit of a letdown, really. I mean, the first half was just dull really; I realise that the introduction of Anakin was necessary, but did we REALLY have to have a comedy computer generated alien?And on the subject of CGI, was anything in that film actually real? For all we know the human beings could have been computer generated like everything else was. I don't know about anyone else, but I actually thought the special effects were better in episodes IV, V, and VI.Also, did George Lucas REALLY have to pilfer around 70% of the plot/set pieces from the other films? There are some striking resemblances to the Death Star attack run, the Emporers death, the idea of a princess in danger and a fight between low tech good guys and high tech baddies.All in all, I enjoyed the second half of the film (basically as soon as the lightsabres come out) because it got back to what Star Wars is all about; a high tech battle between good and evil. Maybe it'll be better once I've seen episodes II and III.P.S. If anyone knows what that bit in the lightsabre duel where Liam Neeson's not doing anything and Maul just looks at him and paces, let me know.",Null,0,1,10 June 1999
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," Cameron's best? What?
","I've heard people say that this is Cameron's best film. Please do not make me gag. Yes, it is a fantastic action film, it's technically flawless and I do love it, but it is NOT the best film he has made.The whole thing is over-sentimentalised; Arnie's supposed to be a heartless, brutally efficient killing machine, not the oversized action figure John Connor turns him into.Also, many of the elements are borrowed from Cameron's other films (e.g. see if you can spot the difference between T1000 opening lift and Alien sticking it's head in the APC).Don't get me wrong, it is a great film, and the T1000 edition is even better, but it's by no means Cameron's best work.",Null,0,3,8 December 1998
Aliens," Whooooooooa!
","If you haven't seen this film, then why the hell not? It's not just a sci-fi film, it's an action film, a war film, and if you watch the director's cut there's also some very touching moments in there.There is something for everyone in this. If you like guns, you'll love it; there's more hi-tech hardware than you can shake a stick at. You want great acting? Look no further than Bill Paxton's cowardly braggart Hudson and Lance Henrickson's commendable 'artificial person' Bishop. And don't forget Paul Reiser who convinces admirably as the sleazy Company rep Carter Burke. Sigourney Weaver got an Oscar nomination for this and (in my humble opinion), hers is probably the worst performance. But that's just my own opinion so please don't flame me.My only complaint is this: why, why , _WHY_ didn't they release the directors cut when they re-released it in the UK? I want sentry guns, dammit!Oh, and if anyone can tell me if Private Crowe ever says anything, anywhere in the film, I'd be grateful. I know Weirzbowski has one line ('Last stand...') but I can't seem to find anything for Crowe. Maybe he didn't get any because he was played by a stuntman. Oh well.Game over, man, game over!",Null,0,0,11 December 1998
Total Recall," Why Arnie?
","Why do people insist on employing the muscle-headed Arnie for films that require even the smallest degree of acting talent? I have no problem with him being in Terminator and Predator, because he's not required to act. However, the role of Doug Quaid/Howser should have gone to someone else.This is a fantastic retelling of the original Philip K. Dick short story, and the plot twists so many times that you're never really entirely sure who the Arnie character is. Plenty of violence, a variety of high tech hardware and thoroughly stupid special effects whenever anyone is exposed to the Martian atmosphere make this a great sci-fi action fest.My only question is how did Paul Verhoeven go from RoboCop and this to Showgirls?",Null,0,0,14 December 1998
Evil Dead II," ARGH!
","Bruce Campbell; what a guy! Over the course of the film he decapitates his girlfriend, has to kill her again with a chainsaw, loses his hand, is punched, bitten and generally driven mad and finally... well, it's a great ending.As long as you take this film on its own terms it's a great laugh. Buckets of blood and cheap special effects as well as some very funny moments keep you watching, and when it does finally end you'll want to see 'Army of Darkness', the sequel. Which isn't as good, but never mind.",10,1,1,12 December 1998
