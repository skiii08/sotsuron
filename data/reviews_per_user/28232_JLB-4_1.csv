Vertigo," A MASTERPIECE
","Hearing different feedback about this movie, (many people are not fond of the ending) I had my doubts. My doubts soon vanished by the first opening scenes. Jimmy's vertigo seems real. I love when he goes on the ladder. 'look up, look down,' The movie was a Hitch masterpiece and Kim Novak is always good.I like the other blond woman and wondered why her character wasn't developed more. Hitch and his blondes!:-)",Null,5,6,11 August 1999
