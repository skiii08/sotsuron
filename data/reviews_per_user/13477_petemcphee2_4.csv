Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Weakest of the entire saga
","Star wars was groundbreaking and achieved that rare thing, a big story told with heart.
The next two movies were also great.
Sadly Lucas revisited the saga with three prequel file that began with this turgid, CGI, souless tale.
To be fair CGI was in its infancy, to be honest it shows.
The trademark clunky dialogue, dreadful JarJar Bink's and the schmaltz from the young actor playing Anakin contributes to a movie that you have to own in a franchise, but don't necessarily want to ever see.
Thankfully JJAbrahms came on board for the final 3 movies.",3,1,6,17 November 2018
Fury," Sven Hassel comes to America
","Capturing the horror of war is easy in most movies.
What Fury does is capture the tension, vulgarity, unease and ease of the tank crew or small unit.
Please revel in the 'Eggs by Emma Scene'.
The best day of the young recruits life becomes a horror of simmering tension and unease as the 'slighted' other crew members arrive.
In Hollywood its rare to see such emotion and tension captured so intricately on celluloid.
An instant classic scene underpinning a war movie that explodes onto the list of 50 best War movies ever!",10,0,1,2 May 2020
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," The love story of Tarantino and Cinema
","Tarantino's movies are renowned for four things; dialogue, famous cameos, soundtrack and Violence.
3 out of 4 ain't bad.
The violence when it comes is like the sun coming out after a long winter...
Sure we get some fights along the way but the bloodbath at the end is what most were waiting for.
I don't expect it was enough for some QT fans but I have to say when I left the cinema I felt like I'd just seen a love story with a happy ending.
The end was a perfect 'what if?'
QT gave fans a happy ending.
His two buddies had saved the day and probably their careers.
I'm happy to add this to my QT collection as I know I will get more out of every viewing like all QT movies.",8,7,19,20 August 2019
War Machine," Possibly the best US show on War since Catch 22
","I'm so excited mpressed with the Shoe.
The writing is on apar with our own Great Armando Iannuci ( In the loop, Veep, The thick of it).
Satire is best when it's less of a parody and more of an expose.
The casting, performances, direction are fantastic.
Pitt is at his manic best as McMahon
(McChrystal) and gives insight into the issues faced by war commanders whose critical positions become so politicised.",10,2,6,27 July 2019
