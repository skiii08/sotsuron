"Run, Fat Boy, Run"," a mildly amusing Rom Com for guys
","I watched this because I like Simon Pegg. It was OK, for what it is, a romantic comedy - aimed at guys.The best part of the movie was Gordon (Dylan Moran). Nearly every laugh I laughed was at /with him. His voice/manner reminds me a lot of Alan Rickman (who I think is fantastic).I also enjoyed the diversity of the cast. For so long I've been used to an all Caucasian cast, but I've noticed their TV shows (dr. who, etc.) have started having a more multiethnic cast to reflect what the country is becoming.The kind of jokes that we were supposed to laugh at were pretty stereotypical guy stuff(crotch scratching, groin kicks, and oh no, seeing another man naked!).Libby, isn't that developed as a character. She's obviously beautiful and a successful entrepreneur. But this film isn't about her, it's about Dennis and his pining for her. I also can't believe any self-respecting female would make the choice she did at the end. (though luckily they refrained from going as far as they could have). Maybe the problem is that I could never have forgiven Dennis behavior at the opening of the film.Simon's character, Dennis is a loser from beginning to the end. He has one small revelation while trying to explain life to a 4.5 year old and makes one small pathetic attempt to redeem himself. Sure, we can root for Dennis, he's a dork, but he's endearing. We can certainly understand his desire to get the beautiful successful woman (but from a female perspective, you can't root for her to take him back). Another problem I had was that his supposed 'change' seemed to me more like a really stupid obstinate refusal to bow to reality. He chooses to risk permanent physical injury to do it. Yes, I know that's not how you were supposed to see it, but that's what it felt like to me.The 3rd main character, Whit, supposedly Dennis's rival, is a great guy. He's sensitive, caring. He's established in life. He keeps himself in shape. He tries to bond with the kid and get along with his girlfriend's ex. He actually seems like a great boyfriend. I found his presence to elicit nothing but pity for Dennis because there's no way he can compete.About 20 minutes from the end the director seems to realize that he wanted us to root for Dennis & Libby, not Whit & Libby. Suddenly Whit is portrayed as a jerk. (Suddenly you find out he plans to take Libby away forever, he acts in a dishonorable manner and then acts reprehensibly towards the kid). That was an incredibly big cheat.I would have preferred to see Dennis grow up and move on with someone else (maybe the Indian woman?)I also subtracted a star for the prominent product placement of footwear ads that encompassed the last section of the film.",6,4,8,23 April 2008
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," IMO- Jar Jar sucks, otherwise good.
","I tried not to have unrealistic expectations coming into the film, so I thought it was good. Especially considering how they had to work with the fact that we knew what was going to happen to most of these characters in the future.  Watching the rise of the emperor should be pretty interesting... without insider knowledge this aspect of the movie would've been totally lost (for those people who may someday watch the movies in order 1-6, it will also be interesting).I thought the Queen was great, I loved her quasi-Japanese headgear and outfits, her voice and I thought she was a pretty good actor. Liam Neeson and Ewan McGregor were good.  The best was the Darth Maul character!!However, I do have a problem with Jar Jar Binks, supposedly the comic relief character.  It just wasn't very funny and threw off the film, as well as generally unbelievable.  jar jar & his whole alien species was completely unintelligible - and what was that accent, was it supposed to be slaughtered 'ebonics' or something.  very uncool.  Not to mention I couldn't understand anything they said!!While we're on the subject of accents, the green trade guys sounded a little too much like an Asian accent,  I also had trouble occasionally understanding them.   I'd rather not hear an accent than a bad one or one that seems to be copied from life. Or make up a language like what Jabba the Hut speaks.  That is much more interesting.My other minor quibble - I prefer more models to computer, but I'm probably in the minority on this one.  A lot of it just looked too fake. Although I did Really like the droid army! especially when they come out all folded up on looking like they're on hangers!",7,0,1,19 May 1999
Minority Report," Spielberg sells out and is lazy
","I love scifi movies. I love seeing movies made from Phillip K. Dick stories (though they can never approach the brilliance of the books). I was able to appreciate BladeRunner, Total Recall & even Paycheck and a Scanner Darkly. I also love stuff that touches on todays political climate and this was the perfect chance to address our current loss of civil rights in the name of 'safety'.But Spielberg has disappointed me deeply....I can forgive the casting of both crazy Cruise & Farrell, neither of whom I like as an actor.Since he's not a first time director should I assume the stolen stuff was intentional homages? Matrix went all GREEN, let's go all BLUE. Let's add TRONs cool looking cars. Clockwork Orange was stunning for it's juxtaposition of calming classical music with violence? Let's use that. OK fine, whatever.What bothered me were the glaringly sloppy points in the script. I'm willing to suspend a lot of disbelief, ignore plot holes (esp. to do with the future). However, you seriously can't expect me to believe that no one revoked his access to high security areas after he'd been found out. Using his old eyes to get into a building not once by twice -- even after he's been convicted & jailed? That's just lazy! If he's still got access and that doesn't set off any alarms, then there was no need to remove them was there?Also, as someone else has mentioned, setting the crucial plot twist in a 'murder she wrote' moment of 'I didn't mention how she died' was just cheap and ruined the movie.And as many others have said, the overly sugary, touchy-feely, everyone is happy ending was WAY OVER THE TOP and totally unnecessary.But what I can't forgive the film is the product placement. I appreciate the way they show how ads are moving to become so individualized. But you know that Guiness, GAP & the others paid Spielberg millions for those scenes! It's incredibly sad that such a famous director would sell out like that. I have lost a lot of respect for him. There could have been other ways to show the same idea without turning the movie into an ad itself. I certainly don't' remember a bunch of scenes set in the mall in PK Dick's story! For shame for tainting his story with your sell out Spielberg!",6,1,6,7 August 2007
In Bruges," I must've seen another film than everyone else - this was really bad!
","It gets 1 star for the lovely travelogue of Bruges, seeing a Heironymous Bosch and maybe another star for not having a happy ending.-The dialogue was atrocious. Worst of all - it was uninteresting and not amusing. I am even more horrified to learn that this was written by a playwright not some 15 year old watching too many Tarantino films & thinking he's being hip/ironic by making fun of midgets, swearing every 3 seconds & having his characters be amoral and unsympathetic.-The characters were not only all uninteresting and unsympathetic they were all boring. Yes, we get it, they're pathetic, Ray's not very bright, they have no other future, they're amoral, most of the people are violent, homophobic, and racist... but they feel a little bad when kids die. There was NO personal growth on any of their parts - a tiny bit of remorse maybe, no sense of an attempt at redemption (Ray is literally CONFUSED about the concept when Ken tries to spell it out for him). -Ken's sacrifice for Ray came out of nowhere and made no sense (he claims Ray has a chance to change-- there is NO indication from Ray that he will redeem himself or change *in the slightest*!). -There were no interesting/novel action bits or shooting. -Nearly every 'twist' was obvious and foreseeable (what the 'instructions' would be, what Ken was doing in the park, most of the ending). -I enjoy most of Ralplh Fiennes movies (other than Maid in Manhattan) but his role here was a waste of time. Unstable evil guy. Absolutely nothing new or even really fleshed out.It was painful and an utter waste of my time! It was derivative and pointless. It didn't entertain me, it didn't make me think, it didn't challenge me, it didn't show me anything new (other than scenery of Bruges), it didn't amuse me (I chuckled maybe twice).If you want a good European locale + action film with character development and clever dialogue watch Hot Fuzz instead. If you want a quirky film about a hit-man thinking about his job & falling in love, rent Grosse Point Blank.",2,36,78,2 September 2008
To Be or Not to Be," uncomfortable to watch/in questionable taste
","I can certainly see why this movie was controversial and had a poor box office turnout when it came out.  For the US to have just entered the war, and reconciling the unfolding events with a comedy making light of the situation is extremely questionable.Even now, with the distance of time, having not lived through the horrific events myself, I was still uncomfortable watching this film.Not that it doesn't have funny moments ('Heil myself'), or that you can't make a comedy using serious historical events.  But there are just moments where you're a little disgusted at the sheer refusal to really take the situation seriously.  For example, People shot are used in the film as jokes or props to a joke.   The most eggregious example is when millions of people dying horrifically in the camps is reduced to a joke by a German officer, 'We do the concentrating, they do the camping'.  That's just not funny, it's completely tasteless!!
The filim is worth watching, it is funny and has lots of snappy dialogue and plot twists - but I think it is important to think about the implications of making and releasing such a film in '42, much less at all.",6,8,26,7 March 2003
As Good as It Gets," sick relationship of a sick man - NOT a love story!!
","Ignoring my initial disgust of the usual 50+ year old man w/ the 30 yr. old woman... I hope no one thinks this is a romance!  What Hunt's character does is trade a dependent child for a dependent adult.  She obviously needs to feel like she's taking care of someone.  Not to mention, that the other half of it is still probably gratitude over what he did for her son!!!! Did you notice how all his 'compliments' to her were about how good she made HIM feel/be?? [Not to mention you can't cure obsessive/compulsive behavior with love - even with the pills he was taking that's probably not enough.  Also, they seemed to imply that he was an asshole because he had this disorder - now, it may exacerbate his tendency to share them w/ people but he was obviously thinking these racist, homophobic, anti-semitic remarks - & that has nothing to do w/ a disorder!!]",5,2,6,27 March 1999
Iron Man 2," Did Oracle pay for this movie? Seemed like a big ad for them
","Negatives: Too much CGI. Too much product placement.Negative a couple of stars for 1.) Larry Ellison 2.) Oracle product placement and name- checking. Ugh, made me want to barf.I can forgive the FAUX news/ Bill O'reilly segment, since I felt it was almost sort of mocking his usual negative spin on any news.Postives: Loved seeing Monte Carlo, though it was way to over saturated and doesn't look like it does in real life. Pepper getting to be CEO. Getting the details right -- the programming and message in the 2nd suit were in Russian. The snide comments in Russian were actually said correctly.",5,0,1,13 May 2012
Juno," ill conceived
","I nearly didn't make it through the opening credits. The soundtrack is painfully bad. Then the portrayal of the abortion clinic as a horrible place was such anti-choice propaganda I nearly stopped watching again. Her pregnancy is of course shown as trouble free and unrealistically easy.The main problem is : Juno is incredibly irritating. She's meanspirited. I would never want to adopt a baby with her genes. (& from someone too stupid to use protection). The decisions she makes are so spur of the moment, that a little thing changes her mindeither way. Michael Cera is 1-dimensional, unintelligent & does nothing but eat tictacs. Jennifer Garner is also 1-dimensional obsessed only with having a baby. The dialogue is completely unrealistic. No one talks like that. Especially, no female (and hopefully no male) would ever refer to breasts as 'fun bags'. The whole film tries WAY too hard to be 'hip'.And the writer seems to think she needs to follow the Clerks/indie model of discussing films and songs to show how hip and indie she is. (p.s. the Melvins are the *ONLY* band I have ever heard BOOED on stage). The forced last minute changes to make a 'happy' ending are incredibly weak and seem to come out of nowhere.I might've snickered twice. Not amusing. Maybe if it had been billed as a tragedy....P.S. I took off another star after I learned this was ripped off from another movie called 'jeni juno'.",3,27,86,21 January 2008
Pan's Labyrinth," Open to interpretation - which makes it even better.
","I was very impressed by this film and how many different ways it can be read/experienced. It is indefinable even by genre or plot (is it a war film, coming of age, fantasy, etc.) I made the mistake (as many) by thinking this was just a dark fantasy/fairy tale. I actually mistook the title to be a reference to Pandora's Box (not the god Pan) - since the preview I saw showed a young girl opening a box and some kind of dark spirits coming out. While watching the film I couldn't help but also reference other stories. Ofelia/Ophelia (of Shakespeare's Hamlet), driven mad by politics and deaths. Ofelia's Alice in Wonderland-like dress & frock and how she descends into the alternate world. The faun was portrayed ambiguously at first and the cloven-hooved animal asking for a sacrifice conjured up Christianity's portrayals of Satan.One's background/beliefs in mythology, religion and the time they grow up in can very easily influence how you perceive this film.I've read nearly 200 comments on IMDb and everyone has different interpretations/experiences. The fantasy world can be read as real or imagined. (though I thought the scene where the captain sees her talking in the maze kind of ruined the ambiguity.) The ending can be read in different ways.Even people's comparisons to other films/directors varies across the board (Takashi Miike, Ridley Scott, Miyzaki, Gilliam, Henson, Neil Jordan, Tim Burton, Etc.). People have mention the film is comparable to other films'Spirited Away', 'Life is Beautiful' 'Company of Wolves' 'Alice in Wonderland' etc.I personally saw a parallel to another film showing the horrors of war & its aftermath 'A Very Long Engagement'. I thought the combination of imagination and belief vs. bitter reality of warfare was similar. As with 'AVLEngagment', I thought the war scenes in this film were both stylized enough to be interesting to watch and bloody enough to be realistic. I dislike gore, I dislike GRATUITOUS violence, but I would have been disappointed if it had been too sanitized and unrealistic. This was not some horror flick where some people watch gratuitous bloodshed for FUN. Yes I had to cringe & look away, but I hope that scenes of torture and killing *would* make me do so.This brings me to the social commentary on today's world - where our country is heading towards fascism (with the removal of our civil rights) and those who dare to question and refuse to blindly obey are condemned as traitors 'giving aid to terrorists'. I thought the speech by the doctor about not being able to blindly 'obey' as the single best moment in the film. This was not just a film about fascism then, it's a film about fascism today - so take heed.Despite the warnings -- people can be selfish and refuse to listen and will pluck at those grapes thinking no one can see them or that it can't hurt to take a small step down that road....All in all a stunningly gorgeous film - the red of the food at the table of temptations, the eyeless creature itself -- not too much CGI (which too me can ruin a film). The acting was superb by all and I thought the main characters were fleshed out fairly well. (I particularly liked the Captain's obsession with time -- for me that scene of him annoyed at the late arrival of the cars & obsession with his watch - conjured thoughts of Italy under Mussolini where (supposedly) the trains always ran on time). I would highly recommend it to all adults (it is Rated R after all).p.s. I was hoping for more commentary about the symbolism in the film -- what is the eyeless creature she unleashed? why did she pick another lock than the one the fairies pointed to? is the mandrake root in milk & blood something from folklore? (The mandrake root reminded me of a Czech film 'Otesanek' where this childless couple adopt a root that becomes their baby).",8,2,5,20 February 2007
Pacific Rim," Shallow rip-off of Neon Genesis Evangelion
","Guillermo Del Toro has an amazing visual sense. His movies are beautiful to watch. However this was visually interesting but otherwise shallow and plot less. This felt like a live action version of Neon Genesis Evangelion. The character were all 1 dimensional archetypes. Other than fight scenes in CGI - which I didn't find that interesting, there's not much to the film. There was not even an interesting backstory on the Kaiju. Their dinosaur form and adaptation to battles was kind of interesting but wasn't explored. The entire plot and ending was completely obvious (you knew who would fall in love, who would nobly sacrifice themselves, who was going to die, etc.)",6,2,2,16 October 2014
Forrest Gump," puzzled by its popularity
","Maybe the book was better.I get that they were going for a 'stupid is as stupid does', to show the triumph of optimism, et al.But mostly this movie just made me sad. Sad that Forrest was treated this way. Sad that even his triumphs were accidental.The fact that they had Forrest get to meet Elvis, the president(s), John Lennon and all those other historical figures just made it seem even more fake than the CGI it took to add him to all those historical scenes (George Wallace, JFK, Johnson, etc.) It threw you out of the realism of the film -- AND also seemed so unrealistic that someone like Forrest could achieve those kinds of things outside of a film.Finally, I don't understand anyone considering his love of Jenny as a true romance. Yes, I believe he loved her. I believe that she loved him in her own way, but not romantically. I understand that she was incredibly messed up by the sexual abuse of her father and that's why she pursued the self-destructive life she did. I understand that she felt she might not be worthy of Forrest because she was suicidal and messed up. She seems to have tried to turn her life around right before she died of AIDS, and was trying to provide for herself without relying on a man.My interpretation of Jenny relationship with Forrest was either: 1. She came home because she was pregnant (cue her sleeping all the time), then had sex with Forrest, then years later when sick, claimed he was the father, so her son would be taken care of. or 2. Forrest truly was the father (and there are hints such as them bending their heads the same way while watching TV & fishing). If so, why did she not tell Forrest he had a child until she was dying? I understand maybe she didn't want to marry him and raise the child together - but that still seemed cruel. Again, I feel that she only married him at the end as she was dying to give the child a parent. Not because she felt true romantic love for Forrest.Best part of the film were the performances. I did like Gary Sinese's performance, that was outstanding. His bitterness at being rescued, his life trajectory and turn around were handled very well. Tom Hanks did a good job of portraying Forrest with dignity. And Robin Wright did a fairly good job as a self-destructive victim struggling to come to terms with her life.",6,1,1,26 July 2015
21 Jump Street," OK, but not for fans of the original, intended for the brainless/sophomoric comedy fans
","I really don't get the the Jonah Hill thing, I don't find him/his movies very funny nor am I into the raunchy teen sex films that seeem all the rage, so I avoided this in the theater. Then, one day, I was on a plane, and since I loved the original series, I decided to watch it......If you think of it as a satire of the original show and remember that it's probably aimed at 14 yr old boys, yes it's kind of funny.However, since what I really liked about the original show was that they took these matters (homophobia, bullying, teen prostitution, drugs) seriously -- turning it into a comedy was rather jarring.Things I was disappointed in: the other 2 main characters, Holly Robinson & Dustin Nguyen's characters were not mentioned at all, I guess the two other sneering officers shown for about a minute were supposed to represent them? Ice Cube's role was turned into nothing but gratuitous swearing that added no value to any of his scenes. (were they trying to say that's all that Cpt Fuller did?)Things I was creeped out at: Jonah Hill's character falling for an underage HS girl was super creepy. Gratuitous sex scene at party of supposedly underage kids being show - ultra creepy. The fact that these supposed officers of the law would raided the lockup to then provide alochol & drugs to kids. I know they're portrayed as stupid & that they were just trying to fit in, but it was so unrealistic & stupid it was jarring.Parts I liked: When they discovered that values at school had changed and dumb jocks were no longer popular and that intelligence and environmentalism were valued. The cameo by 'Tom' & 'Doug' (even though it was during a very dumb scene) The inside jokes to keep an old-school fan amused (naming a character Jenko, Korean Jesus, etc.)",5,6,11,21 June 2012
The Bourne Ultimatum," Deeper moments of introspection make it a good thriller
","I was expecting a rehash of film 1 & 2- the usual international locales, car chases, fights & indestructible Bourne tries to get info. - nothing too deep, so I was pleased it exceeded my expectations.Nice to see a film where they don't throw the main stars into a romance just because they happen to be male & female! Chase & fight scenes: I found them too fast too watch/follow for my taste - but at the same time -I could respect that the speed, editing & camera work were more aimed at making you feel like you were there and how quickly it all happens (instead of a John Woo-like slo-mo so you can appreciate the grace and skill of each blow) and I did like how they incorporated 'on the spot' improvisational fighting with whatever they could grab (book, candlestick, etc.) It made it seem much more realistic and showed the brutality of it.Mostly though I like how the film made you consider larger issues of national security, torture, assassination, civil rights, freedom and personal choice.Can the US really monitor anyone anywhere in the world that fast (through cameras, satellites, passport RFIDs, cell phone locating, monitoring all phone conversations for keywords). (We already know they're allowed do it without warrants under the current administration) Can they really just kill anyone they want anywhere? Shoot a British citizen in a train station? Are assassination and torture justified for our 'security' or just easier? Is blind obedience and following orders worth it/ I don't want to give too much away but I enjoyed the parts that touched on personal choice and the responsibility/moral issues of killing.",8,1,1,7 December 2007
"I, Robot"," Good plot, painfully poor dialogue
","I think they did a good job of taking some key themes from Isaac Asimov's famous book of short vignettes and turning it into a suspenseful story. I was even fine with the addition of Will Smith's character and his backstory. However the dialogue was painfully bad. They really should've worked on that more. The effects were pretty good (I'm still not a huge CG fan), I especially liked how they handled Sonny's 'face'. The most disappointing was the obvious product placement for the car and the shoes. I am a huge fan and (before they doubled the price) owned 4 different pairs of Converse, but I was still offended at how much they were pushed in the film. They served no purpose at all in furthering the plot and were merely there to sell the product. Overall, it was worth watching. Next time though, I wish they would concentrate on the dialogue as much as they obsess over trying to wow us with the 'special effects'. I give it a 7 minus 1 for product placement.",6,0,0,27 May 2005
Collateral," kind of boring actually
","I admit I was prejudiced from the start - the ads turned me off - I dislike Tom Cruise (how stupid do you have to be to be a Scientologist?) and what was up with that hair? I understand he's trying to mask his identity but that fake hair calls attention to him. Also, the plot of the just looked dumb. Unaware taxi driver participates in shootings?Then a coworker convince me to give it a try. Knowing I like Noir films he said I would like it.I like Noir films, I like films with character study /developemnt/exploration. I enjoy films that have some action but more dialogue. I should have liked this film!I felt no connection to, no interest in, no empathy for any of the characters (not even the poor taxicab driver). I did not feel there was self-realization or any bonding going on between the two characters. Both actors were adequate -if unexciting. The scenery was nice (there were a few nice shots of LA at night), but not spectacular. The 'action' sequences were just there in the service of the story. The plot was boring and generic. I barely cared enough to watch the thing all the way through just to find out what happens. (Out of the entire film, only that scene in the jazz club interested me- that was interesting, well filmed & had a nice twist.)Maybe it's just the director's (Mann) style I don't get. I remember seeing Heat and being surprised that everyone was raving about it. It was interesting but not the end all be all or anything too original. (I can think of several Chinese films that have done that bad guy/good guy bond/find similarities much better- City On Fire to name one.)I felt like this film was trying for something but failing. Was I supposed to find the last bit of Tom Cruise's dialouge philosophical interesting? Was the last shot supposed to be 'ART'? It seemed trite and a bit pretentious.P.S. for someone who's supposedly an acclaimed director why did he need to bow to the ever-encroaching product placement by including lingering shots of a Bacardi ad? I took away a whole star just for that!",5,1,3,28 June 2006
Batman Begins," Batman- performed as a junior high school production.
","Casting issues: I just couldn't get over how Rachel and the Scarecrow/Dr. Crane both looked like they were twelve. I realize this is supposed to be Batman 'the early years' but it was hard to take them seriously in their professions. (plus of course I'm not impressed by Katie's 'acting' so that didn't help). And I love Michael Caine, but where's the old Alfred?? Christian Bale was OK, better than Michael Keaton's neurotic dweeb but not as good (IMO) as Val Kilmer.It was an OK prequel, though certainly not deserving of being in IMDb's top 250. It did a fairly good job of sticking to the storyline and not contradicting earlier versions. It had all the standard ingredients. It tried to bring in the deeper philosophical underpinnings of Batman's character. The usual flashbacks to his parents death. There was a simplistic 'Nepal=enlightenment' sort of stereotype thing going on. There were ninjas (everyone loves ninjas right?) It also tried to make Batman more of a fighter than someone relying on toys/gadgets so we got some good fights scenes (more inspiration from the growing interest in Hong Kong action films). There was the generic childhood friend/love. The plot was basic destroy city stuff. There were the generic throw-away one-liners ('nice car'/'nice coat').The mise-en-scene was pretty good, too much CG for my taste - but since when did Gotham resemble Chicago? I always thought it was a stand in for NYC? And why does Batman live in a mansion in the English countryside? These were kind of jarring moments that broke the spell of suspended disbelief for me.Basically it was a crowd pleaser with nothing too original. You can figure out the plot miles ahead, but doesn't mean it's not an enjoyable ride to the end. I think I still prefer the more stylized Tim Burton movies though (exc. Keaton who's miscast) - but this was a worthy successor. The part I probalby liked best was the Conservative (punishing people and/or profiting off crime) vs. Liberal (address the root cause of crime, understand things in context, try to help people)arguments that crop up periodically through the film. Particularly I felt they made a good distinction between justice and revenge and showing Wayne's having to choose between the two.",7,0,3,11 August 2006
28 Days Later...," good, but derivative (mild spoiler - discussion of the plot's roots in BBC tv series)
","I got the feeling that Danny Boyle watched the following British post-apocalyptic style series and then tried to make them more scary by adding in a more gory/graphic threat.In 1975 the BBC made an excellent series called 'Survivors' which is very similar to the film except that the virus killed everyone instead of turning them into zombie-like creatures.  It was a little more psychological than horror, but similar themes exploring survival and what it all means to maintain one's humanity and how to rebuild emerged each episode.  In fact, one episode featured a military style dictatorship set up that expected to use female survivors as breeding stock.  If you liked the exploration of Survival and the fight to maintain humanity (both physically and mentally) behind 28 Days Later, you should check out this series (some PBS stations play it occasionally).In 1981 there was also 'Day of the Triffids' (from the 1962 film) which also featured a deserted London and the banding together of survivors to keep safe from the attacking plants.  It's not as good, but still interesting.",6,0,0,8 July 2003
X-Men: The Last Stand," interesting idea, hampered by poor dialogue
","I know there's 1200+ other comments probably saying the same thing. Some of the in a much more coherent intelligent way...but still wanted to add my 2 cents.... I haven't read the comics so I can't comment on the deviations from those.However, just from the experience of watching the other two films, I was disappointed.The dialogue was painfully cliché and cheesy. (Does every tense standoff with a female mutant have to end with the sneer 'bitch'? Does every momentous death of a loved one have to end with sinking to your knees and screaming 'NOOOOOOOO' into the heavens?) How trite is the 'no fury like a woman scorned' line? (or even including that scene brining Mystique down to nothing but petty revenge).So many new mutants barely referred to - would have been nice to see some of them fleshed out since this is supposed to be an ensemble cast (esp. as you keep killing off the main ones). All the 'bad' mutants had to be all gothed out with dark hair, tattoos and black clothes as de rigeur for membership? (Why didn't they just dress the 'good' mutants in white for a complete lack of subtlety?)Small details/consistency issues seem to have been overlooked as they did there 'oh look what we can do with Special FX. For one example: While uprooting the GG Bridge was kind of cool, how did it suddenly turn into night? And if all the people fled their cars (exc. the family stuck in their gasguzzling SUV) why were all the cars headlights on at the end?Some of the fights were interesting (Fire v. Ice) but as others have said the different mutant powers could have been used in an interesting way for a more interesting fight (at least while dodging the un-mutating bullet). I still think it was worth watching. There were some good moments:The deaths of major characters was sad, but it was also nice to see a film not afraid to kill major characters.... and it IS the last film. And to think about Magneto having to struggle through life as a non-mutant is interesting.As always Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellan were superb and I would watch any film just for them. Hugh Jackman was good, but I didn't feel his character was as central or was expanded on in any way like the first two films.The general idea of the 'cure' which some mutants might actually want, but more would find offensive since it implies there is something wrong with them was interesting. And it was obvioius that this was (as many scientific advances) going to be turned into a weapon by the government.Since the mutant issue has often stood in as a metaphor for gayness (or other things that are considered 'deviant' by some in our society) - it is hard to support the idea of the 'cure' because we are supposed to agree that it is not a sickness that needs a cure. On the other hand I think they did a good job of showing why some, like Rogue would want to give up such amazing powers (you could empathize what it would be like to never touch a loved one).So worth watching, but kind of a sad conclusion to a good series.",7,0,0,3 June 2006
The Lives of Others," Great film on it's own -- even better (sadder) when you consider today's current parallels
","There are too many reviews already praising this film in-depth. I just had to add that having been to Berlin a few years ago and visiting the Checkpoint Charlie museum, seeing the few remaining feet of 'the Wall' and reading about the history of the city during WWII and after - I was incredibly interested in how citizens of East Germany lived during those times. (I regretted then and now DEEPLY regret not finding time to visit the Stasi archives/ museum!)That would have been enough for a great film, but the painful reality of our current government taking away our civil rights and warrantless wiretapping it's citizens makes this resonate much more personally.And I didn't even make the connection to the fact that the film starts in 1984 (surely a nod to Orwell) until I read some other comments.The film does have a few minor flaws, but it has so much resonance that it becomes a great film.p.s. I'm amused that I'm not the only one who thought the main actor resembled Kevin Spacey. I'm sorry to hear he passed away, I would have liked to see more of him.",8,1,2,7 March 2008
Moulin Rouge!," brought me to tears - it's so bad!
","I haven't paid to see such a bad film in many a year.Let me start with what I liked:  Ewan McGregor is very attractive & a good actor, and I generally like John Leguizamo (although I did not like the way they portrayed Toulese-Latrec as just some gay stereotype).  The only other plus - the costumes & mise-en-scene were very well-done (although I'm sure totally inaccurate).Otherwise it was so horrible, I almost wish I had paid to see 'the Animal' instead.  I don't like musicals, but I can usually put up with the genre. Now I could be wrong, but wasn't Ewan McGregor lip-syncing?   What pained me the most was the anachronistic use of '80's songs/song lyrics (Nirvana, Madonna & the Police to name a few) -- was just too much for me.
It was the utter rejection of any realism that annoyed me.  The lovers float up among Disney-like stars & sprinkles (even their clothes change).  A gun comes out of window & flies across (a computer simulated) Paris to strike the Eiffel Tower.  I'm willing to grant a lot of poetic license (for example, a realistic victim of consumption hacking up lots of blood & completely emaciated would not have been good) - and certainly in a musical, we expect people to just randomly burst into song & dance -- but some semblance of normality would've been nice.The writing was mediocre at best.  Probably because the were dealing with a terribly trite plot.I'll spare you further and more specific complaints, because I can't bear to even contemplate this film anymore.  I simply had to add a warning as a counterpoint to the comment I saw posted here.",1,2,6,2 June 2001
Meet Joe Black," Poor older sister
","The dad obviously barely cared  for the older daughter, not even bothering to try a false repudiation of her statement that he had always favored the younger daughter.  She strove the whole movie to please her dad and he ignored her almost completely. it was quite sad.The movie was a little too long.  I was also not enjoying Pitt's attempt at a jamacian accent.can't wait to see the original though.",6,0,0,15 June 1999
Slap Shot," depressing 'slice of life' movie - but NOT a comedy
","I was improperly prepared for this film. I was told it was a comedy. I found nothing amusing. I then decided it must be a inspirational/message film about team work, ethical playing, violence, trying to make money by any means necessary, a gender and class commentary. Maybe just a commentary on violence, sportsmanship and game playing. Wrong again. If I had just been told it was JUST a film showing what life was like in a minor hockey league in the 70's I might've appreciated it more instead of looking for humor or meaning. There is no payoff. No growth in the characters (in fact they degenerate into nothing but goons).It was just a sad movie about some pathetic losers who were losing their dreams, their livelihood and their spouses. Very few of the hockey players were likable people so it was hard to keep watching when you don't care what happens to them. I think Paul Newman's character was supposed to be sympathetic but I thought he was just selfish and rather despicable.There were so many sideplots that could have been developed and would have interested me more. A town losing it's entire point of existence? Barely mentioned. The alienation and clinical depression of the wives? Shown, but not really addressed - just a given. A few hints at a critique of the violence taking over the sport - but in the end there was just an embrace of the new 'style'.It's also hard to watch from a modern sensibility. Having spent decades trying to overcome the sexism and homophobia of previous times-I really have no desire to return to those days (though it might be instructional for younger audiences who have no idea what it used to be like). The epithet F*G and the word lesbian used as an insult were pretty much the entire dialogue. While I respect that it is probably an accurate reflection of the times and the dialogue - I no longer find it funny.***SPOILER***The end was just sad. Watching them give up on sportsmanship; lose their jobs (was Newman lying about his new gig like he'd lied about most of the rest?);and delude themselves into thinking they'd stay with their wives. Nothing/nobody had changed (or at least not for the better). I saw this film as an indictment of hockey - not as a positive fan tribute as it seems most of the other commenters saw.",4,5,14,18 December 2007
Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind," If she's so great, why can't she remember to wear underwear?
","Great movie.  I always enjoy Miyazaki's environmentalist ideals. I just have one tiny little problem with the movie.  If she's such a badass princess (scientist, warrior, pilot, etc.) why on earth can she not remember to put on underwear?? I didn't particularly enjoy all the crotch shots of a young girl.This perverse sexualization of young girls is why I'm not as huge a fan of anime as I would like to be!  I'm so tired of random T&A in anime just because it's drawn by (and mainly for) sexually frustrated heterosexual men.",8,1,28,3 November 2003
Transformers," All product placement, all the time.
","I didn't watch Transformers as a kid but I was familiar with them and was looking forward to seeing this as a feature length film. Unfortunately I was disappointed.The good: The look of and way they handled the Transformers transforming was pretty impressive. (However it usually happened too fast to appreciate how it worked.) And the plot was OK, I could suspend disbelief enough to follow and enjoy the plot.However the rest of the movie was disappointing: It seemed written by and for a 14 year old boy. Geeky selfish, spoiled upper-middle class Caucasian boy gets his dad to buy him a car so he can ditch his friend to go after a 'hot' girl (who he doesn't even know anything about other than that she is attractive), and then of course ends up saving the world/getting the girl. The script was pathetic - trying to be hip in places it didn't work. Editing was done poorly -- too hard to follow the fights and the bouncing between plot points was not handled well.I counted at least 10 separate product placements and would love to know just how much of the budget GMC paid to get their name and their logo not only on the Transformers but the showing of dealerships and other GMC cars. (Plus Ebay, BurgerKing, XBox, DeloitTouche, etc. etc.) I could have forgiven the rest of the flaws since it's just a fluffy action flick but paying $10 to see one big ad really really upsets me!",3,3,7,16 July 2007
Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix," Good, but could've been better - new director please for the next one
","I know, there's already nearly a thousand comments on this film.... however, I wanted to add my minor quibbles on the things that disappointed me a bit and could be improved for the next few films.1. The movie from fantasy to 'realism'. I dislike seeing the wizards in their 'street clothes'. I don't want scenes from England (other than the uber-conformist opening scenes with the Dudleys). To me this is an enchanted other world and it should be made to be very different than the Muggle world. This may seem very minor but I found the clothes to be incredibly jarring and it ruined the feel of the film for me. 2. Cutting subplots/maintaining the focus/point of the books. Like many fans have mentioned, I would happily have sat through a longer but more complex film (a la LOTR) -- but given that they made a regular feature length film --I don't mind them cutting some part of the book out(like the Quidditch matches or the hallway monitor issues). However, I thought one tiny subplot should have stayed in (and it would've taken all of 30 seconds to add). The focus of the books has always been that it's actually NOT ALL ABOUT HARRY - that he always triumphs because they are a combined force. This film captures that a bit but left out the part of the prophecy where it's revealed that this could have all happened to Neville instead. This was such a revelatory moment in the book for me - so I was strongly bothered by this being cut from the movie. I think this fits into the message that Harry (while certainly talented and special in someways) is not a super-power charged indestructible one man army.3. One tiny miscast (Amongst such excellent casting). I'm a huge fan of nearly all the British actors (esp. Maggie Smith & Emma Thompson). Imelda Stauton did a tremendous job of conveying cloyingly sweet but insidiously deadly menace! She displayed the sort of intense understated brilliance as in 'Vera Drake'. I think the kids are growing into their parts nicely. Luna was a nice addition. The only person that didn't work for me was Helena Bonham Carter. In this film, she seemed to play the same sort of Tim Burton film character - vaguely goth/creepy. All the other actors became their characters for me, but every time she appeared I thought 'oh look it's Helena Bonham Carter being Helena Bonham Carter'. Please rethink her casting for the next film or find some",7,0,0,7 November 2007
Inside Man," interesting thriller
","OK, so you have to suspend some belief. Was it supposed to be guilt that led someone to keep 50+ year old incriminating documents? If you can accept that, it's pretty interesting to watch and figure out what's going on. I generally like Spike Lee films, but as always he does have issues with his women. I love Jodie Foster but her character was one dimensional. There was no explanation of who she was, how she got that way or how she could wield any power. Denzel's gf despite being a cop in her own right was just shown a few times lying around in lingerie waiting for him to come home while he's busy working on a huge hostage situation. The trampy gum smoking Albanian immigrant. I guess I should feel glad that the hostage woman was ignored, except of course for them trying to identify her by her bust size.Overall, it was worth watching. It gave enough clues so you could try to figure stuff out, but also kept you guessing til the end. As usual, there's some small moments highlighting racial issues (I liked the commentary on 'Grand Theft Auto' game that encourages violence and sexism) or a Sikh victim being automatically treated as a criminal/terrorist. I also liked the fact that they had a diverse multiracial, cross gender/cross age group of robbers.",7,1,1,3 June 2006
Stranger Than Fiction," A Will Ferrell movie I liked!
","I kept being intrigued by the ads of someone narrating over a person's life. I adore Emma Thompson. But I could not bring myself to pay to see it in the theaters because it had Will Ferrell so I assumed it would be some sort of sophomoric and puerile comedy.Yet the previews had so intrigued me, I decided to rent it.I was pleasantly surprised to find it was not a brainless comedy and that I enjoyed it. I actually enjoyed Will Ferrell's acting. The movie wasn't perfect, but the acting was excellent, it kept me guessing, it was amusing and even the cynic in me was touched by his gift. In all it was interesting and amusing and worth a watch.I especially enjoyed the scenes where the literary professor tried to figure out the story (as the audience was). I did wonder whether Dustin Hoffman's repeated questioning about counting items was a purposeful (or was I over-reading?) reference to his autistic counting character in Rainman.",8,0,0,4 July 2008
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Political warning - US is going to the dark side...
","Actually you could read this in a variety of ways. Emperor Palpatine's consolidation of power and rule seems to dovetail with what Putin seems to be doing in Russia.However being an American, I of course read most of the parallels as it relates to our current political situation. There are a lot of examples of this. Palpatine controlling the Senate and the Courts and thus all the power gave him the freedom to do what he wanted --a direct parallel to Republican's stranglehold on our government. Pretending that he waged war for peace. Controlling the populace through fear, removing their rights - demonizing those who spoke out against him, etc. etc. Dialogue from the movie- 'You are either with me or any enemy' is just a little too close to Bush's (Nov. 2001) speech - 'You are either with us or against us'. Ewan McGregor's response about Siths seeing things in a simplistic binary was an excellent retort. There are probably a dozen other examples, but I don't remember off the top of my head. After watching the film, I was mulling over these parallels and wondering how internationally they were intended to critique the current American political system. I read an article that said Lucas had made this parallel on purpose and he was concerned about the danger of losing our democratic ideals. I doubt this will serve as a great wake up call for all Americans but it is another reminder that we are losing our democracy too, and are turning into the Empire!Anyway, aside from the political warning/satire, I thought the movie was pretty good. (Almost made up for the first one!)*****SPOILER******* One thing that really bugged me was why they revealed that there were two children. This would COMPLETELY ruin the surprise in the later films. I assume Lucas wants to think that people will be watching these films in order 1-6 - and this one minute of film ruins the suspense of the other films. It should have ended with the birth & not knowing who was born.",8,1,3,19 May 2005
Bruce Almighty," recruitment movie?
","I thought this might be funny. I can accept the premise of a supernatural being granting you power. I think Jim Carey is funny. I came to it with midling expectations, just hoping for some laughs at someone learning about the corruption of power and his own life.However,this movie actually made me mad. Not just disappointed that it wasn't good, or that I wasted two hours. It made me mad because I realized I was watching one big Latter Day Saints commercial (remember the 'who broke my window' moralizing segments on TV?)I could accept the 'stop whining', 'stop asking god to fix your life' ... sort of message. However, this movie then preached the need to 'surrender your will to god' and that you need to 'trust that god knows best about how your life should be' - in other words the same old accept your place in life argument of many organized religions. A lecture about my need for blind faith in some supernatural being was NOT what I was looking for. I don't believe bad things happen for a 'good' reason or as part of some larger plan and should just be accepted.Nor was it amusing to be preached to.I'm actually mad it was aired on TV. I'm mad it was made. I'm hoping Jim Carey & Morgan Freeman are ashamed they made it. And I'm annoyed they made a sequel (that I will avoid like a biblical plague).",3,2,5,9 August 2007
Casino Royale," Ambivalent. Good non-sexist action film, but is it Bond?
","I'm torn. Do I prefer the more realistic, more psychologically interesting film? Or do I want the campy, over the top stuff?I can't be too upset that they deviated from the formula. I have a hard time watching original James Bond films - they can be amusing and so infuriatingly offensive at the same time. But because they're so over the top they can be amusing enough to overlook the sexism, racism & homophobia in the early films. (and apparently I'm the only person in the world who does not like Sean Connery).In this film, I was so happy to not see overly sexualized naked women, no overly exoticized 'native' women for Bond to love & leave. No evil seductress. (Though there was the obligatory 'good' one that sacrifices herself). And not having the woman named after her vagina or tits was refreshing. The lack of misogynism alone makes it worth watching (IMO)!!The film was OK as a basic action film. As others have said his character seems more like Jason Bourne than James Bond. You have Bond learning how to be a killer, learning how to be a spy.... presumably becoming the Bond we're used to. (sort of how Batman Begins 'restarted' the character). This is the pre-cool Bond. He hasn't gotten the fancy cars, how to wear a tux, doesn't have a favorite drink and one who actually cared about women as people, not as nothing more than a body. This not quite the James Bond we're used to... (yet).This is both interesting and a disappointment, simultaneously.The problems: Leaving out some of the key elements did hurt the film. The previous franchise succeeded because: -We liked thegadgets. They were silly, but they were interesting. -We liked the over the top villains -- we can see everyday villains in all the other action films. This is what we watch the Bond films for. We laughed at the man who takes over the moon or tries to burn the world, but it was kind of fun. -We liked seeing the suave collected & cool Bond. Seeing the uncertain, struggling Bond is interesting, but not what we want to see. -It doesn't have Pierce Brosnan. Craig is OK, but no one was as born to play the part as Brosnan. And finally, but just as importantly: Get rid of the product placement (lost a star just for that). It's cheap and tacky. Can you not get enough funding for a Bond film that you have to whore yourself out? Trust me, I'm not going to run out and buy a watch so I can look like Bond.Anyway, I would give the 2nd film a chance (at least a rental). I'm curious to see how they will continue the evolution of the character into the cool, but cold killer we know and love/hate.",6,1,3,23 October 2008
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," homoerotic overtones....
","I will have to reread that book, I certainly don't remember such homoerotic overtones in the book.  All those lingering looks, protestations of undying devotion, etc. etc. At the end we were cheering for Frodo & Sam to kiss!  :) (Even the other hobbits Pippin & Merry seemed more like a couple than just friends). They almost could've just left out the three women in the trilogy and made it completely male centered universe.  It was quite amusing to watch from this perspective.It was also an excellent movie and a fine adaptation of the trilogy.",8,0,1,22 December 2003
The Matrix," Dr. Who inspired?
","I realize it's hard to be original, and that similar stuff has been done over & over again... but I was still kind of disappointed when a week after seeing the movie I was watching an old Dr. Who (from the '70's I think) where he has to mentally enter into the Matrix to battle the Master who controlled the reality in the Matrix.  What happens to him in the matrix happens to his body in the 'real' world as well... he tries to deny that the virtual world is real & has any hold over him. etc. etc.Although not as cute, Tom Baker's a better actor than Keanu Reeves  and the ending wasn't quite as predictable either - all it lacked was the fancy new effects.",7,0,1,28 June 1999
Sin City," Overly violent, sexist garbage.
","I have not read Frank Miller's comic books that this was based off of (though I was told this was a pretty faithful rendition and he codirected) so these comments are only about the movie (though they may apply to the comics as well).Let me just get the positive comments out of the way. I liked the style of the movie. The black and white with just touches of colors was very nice. The old film noir style feel, with the old cars, the cheesy dialogue, the references to 'broads' and 'dames' was all pleasing. Even as I found the constant violence off-putting I was still able to appreciate small touches, like the fact that the blood ran white.Unfortunately, the rest of the movie is crap. I was just dying to get out of there, so it seemed endlessly long. I should have known there were going to be problems when I saw Robert Rodriguez (having unfortunately suffered through Dusk to Dawn) and Quentin Tarantino (who I feel is a derivative hack) in the credits. Both seem to like to show excessive violence just for shock value. (Don't get me wrong, I don't have an automatic aversion to violence, I like John Woo films - i just don't like the lingering shots of needless/gory violence.)IMO, the film has three MAJOR flaws, all dealing with the idea of gender. The flaw is that the film is misogynistic - women are nothing but sexual objects and victims. The second (relating to the first) is it's portrayal of men as the rescuers of women. Third, the portrayal of a girl/old man 'love' story.***Spoilers start here***First problem: Every woman in the film was a whore, a stripper or a woman of loose morals. Even when the men worshiped them as 'angels' it was always merely for their physical appearances. And yes, the men weren't all that great themselves, but there was still a wider ranger of character than just sexual object. Furthermore, the women were constantly naked or nearly naked. Even the social worker had to be shown naked. Once again, I don't mind nudity, if it fits the story, if it's tastefully done and if it's both sexes. However in this case, it seemed to be there just because the directors liked to show female T&A whenever possible. There was no male nudity (of course).Secondly, most of the men in the film (all the main characters) seemed to operate on the assumption that they were rescuing women. Women were helpless (sexual) objects that had to be rescued from serial killers, serial rapists, abusers, pimps, etc. Needless to say there was a disturbing amount of violence against women shown. Even when the film pretended to make a nod towards 'empowered women'- they still failed and had to be rescued. For example, the stripper girl needed a 68 year old man to help her; an entire town of armed whores still needed one man to save them; and delusional psychopath goes on a killing rampage to avenge his 'love' after a one night stand with a hooker.Which brings me to the third problem, the incredibly disgusting relationship between the 19 year old and the 68 year old. Now, Harold & Maude is one of my favorite movies, so even though the age difference is disgusting to me, clearly I can overcome that natural revulsion when presented with the right couple/circumstances. Apart from the usual grossness of old men preying on young women, the whole relationship was disturbing. We have a 60 year old cop save an 11 year old girl from rape and gruesome torturous death. The cop is abandoned by everyone, goes to jail and only the girl stays true to him. He clings to her image of innocence and makes her into some sort of ideal image to obsess over. When he is released 8 years later, he goes to find her and make sure she is OK. Where it becomes truly disturbed is when he finds out that she is now a sexy stripper and they decide they are in love. This is a highly inappropriate and sick relationship. She's 19, he's 68. They know nothing of each other (or we can at least presume he thinks he knows her because she wrote him letters - but she knows nothing about him). Shis is clearly suffering from hero worship because he rescued her. He's clearly focused on her as the one last good thing he's done and loves the idea of her as a little girl/and then later as a sexy stripper. It was so revolting I wanted to puke in the theater....and they wonder why women comprise a smaller percentage of comic book readers.... maybe if they stopped putting out this kind of sexist crap, we could get into it more. Until then I will continue to avoid this kind of crap and focus on graphic novels that provide *clothed* characters that are not 1 dimensional with a strong plot that does not rely merely on the shock value of graphic violence. I suggest you avoid this movie and do not pay money to reinforce the notion that these are the kind of comic adaptations we want to see.There are WAY better noir films out there, fairly good comic book adaptation; WAY better violent films and tons of other T&A movies to watch instead!",1,10,24,1 April 2005
The Soloist," Film seems to claim schizophrenics don't need medication?
","I know someone with schizophrenia. He needs to be medicated in order to function. While medicated he can function normally (work, play music, be married), when unmedicated he becomes paranoid, self destructive & suicidal.Therefore it really saddened me that the LAMP director argued against medicating Nathaniel (of course he doesn't want it, he can't tell he's crazy!) and even after a violent attack against Lopez, he doesn't take the steps necessary to get help for Nathaniel.Yes, support and friendship are important, but when you can't differentiate between reality and delusion, when voices in your head control your actions, you do need medical intervention.",4,7,11,28 May 2010
From Here to Eternity," Confused, thought it was anti-military comment
","I guess the reason I didn't really like the film is because I expected a completely different film. I'd heard this film had won Oscars and I'd heard of the beach scene, but knew nothing else about the film. I thought it was partly a romance and partly a look at the army. I was caught up in the forbidden love of Kerr & Lancaster and interested in Clift & Reed's 'relationship' and was eager to see how they resolved their problems. I was also getting the impression that the Army was an awful place to be - Lancaster, Sinatra & Clift's characters experienced a great deal of hardship and misery because of their enlistment and from their fellow men. So it came as a shock to me when these men supposedly in love refused to try to better their miserable positions in the army by trying to move up or out of it. They spurned the women just to stay in the army? Even though they were miserable where they were they chose the army as their love. What? That made no sense. Their superiors were all incompetent or sadistic losers, in the case of Clift, nearly all his fellow enlistees treated him like dirt. The army was the reason his best friend was killed. Yet because that's all he knew, he stuck to it. IMO, that's not a good reason to choose something.As the film was from 1953, I thought it was set AFTER WW2 and didn't realize this was the days right BEFORE Pearl Harbor- so the bombing was a shock. I had to rethink my experience of the entire film. I could appreciate how even after all the misery everyone banded together for defense. If the men had turned away from their women after the attack that would have made more sense. I could understand not wanting to transfer away once the action starts. My biggest problem with the film was that I could not for the life of me understand why Clift did not identify himself when he was coming back to the base!?!?! That made no sense at all. Of course they're going to shot someone they don't recognize who won't identify themselves in the midst of an attack. So I went from sympathizing with him for most of the film to thinking he was an idiot.In the end I had very little sympathy for any of the male characters. I thought they were stupid for choosing to stay in their miserable lives. If this had been shown as a patriotic choice following the attack I could have understood it better. Also, I thought the scene with the guy refusing to pass out ammunition during an attack as showing the rigidity and stupidity of the military - which I don't think was the point of the scene/movie. I kept thinking if these dumb schmucks had transfered out they wouldn't have been there for the 'preemptive' strike -they'd be promoted and (maybe) happily married. So I had much less sympathy than I think I was supposed to have.",6,1,4,17 April 2006
V for Vendetta," A Call To Action: See it now and stop our world from becoming like that.
","The story is classic. It has parallels to Hitler, the USSR, Thatcher/Reagan and now Bush/Blair. I know the graphic novel was written in response to Thatcher(& Reagan), but given our current geopolitical climate it seems a perfect time to resurrect this story. As a fan of the novel, I was prepared for changes and tried not to mind the addition/deletion of subplots and minor changes. I liked how they adapted and updated it to todays issues. As an example- having had to be fingerprinted recently for a promotion (and having the DOJ REFUSE to tell me what happens to my 'criminal history' record in IAFIS when I leave the job) - I can appreciate what it will be like when we have to use our fingerprints as an ID for everything!Overall I thought the film stuck to the imagery and the ideas in the book pretty well. A few moments rang false for me (the roaring burning guy image they kept showing only made us laugh at how bad it was). I felt as if we were in 'England as Americans see it' (even I know more British cuss words than 'Bollocks'! I tried to just see it as a hybrid English/American amalgamation rather than England as it is today.I wish they had included a few things that I thought were important to the story. I felt they downplayed the xenophobia and racist genocide a bit more than they should have. Also, I thought they made a huge mistake in not portraying the economic depression that also played (and plays in today's world) a part in people's submissiveness to the regime and one of their sources (apart from fear) of power. Especially given our failing economy (at least in America) - I thought this was an important parallel that should have stayed in. Finally, while the undercurrent of love was fine, that last kiss/declaration of love was too cheesy and spoiled the last few minutes and (IMO) threw off the point of the film.The cast was superb. Even Natalie Portman who I have been ambivalent about as an actor, pulled off her role fairly well. (I appreciated the irony of John Hurt, the hero in the movie version 1984 is now one of the bad guys in a similar reminder of the dangers of fascism). The mise-en-scene was well done. This film actually makes you root for the (symbolic) destruction of a beloved global landmark.The single biggest failing though was the ADVERTISING/ product placement! There is an extremely overt brand placement of a TV brand and a shorter, less obvious computer brand placement. This insidious advertising especially does not belong in a film in which one of the themes is media control of what people think/do/(buy)and references corporations involvement in politics! These are not struggling producers who couldn't get a film financed without whoring themselves out to consumer interests. (Not to mention-it was anachronistic-how are they getting American computers if the US is in civil war and it's products are blockaded from Britain??) For shame. I deducted stars for that! I know product placement is being used in more and more films, but I do not appreciate it.",8,8,15,14 April 2006
The Island," Watch 2 hours of commercials instead!
","I'm not a Michael Bay fan. He's all about explosions and over the top action at the expense of plot. His films seem to be aimed at 14 year old heterosexual boys. But I love scifi movies & I like Ewan McGregor so I rented it anyway. The plot was OK. Sort of a Logans Run meets THX1138. It could have been an OK fluff film ... but sexism & rampant product placement ruined it for me.The constant stream of obvious pointed product placement the entire length of the film was revolting!Additionally, any film made in my lifetime makes a joke about not giving women credit cards can not be a film I would recommend to anyone!UPDATE: I later found out he was successfully sued for stealing the plot & even some scense from a movie called 'Clonus' -- which makes me like it even less!",4,1,2,24 May 2008
