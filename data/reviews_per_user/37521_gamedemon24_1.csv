The Monuments Men," A group of unlikely men get around the Nazis trying to recover historical art.
","I didn't even realize this was still in theaters until I saw it today. I came about two hours early for Non-Stop, so I just said the hell with it and saw this instead. Monuments Men's strongest asset is its cast. Damon, Goodman, Murray, Clooney, and whoever the hell else is in this movie interact with each other very well, better that any cast I've seen in years. It's not really an action movie per say, but more of a historical drama set in WW2. It truly is a fine movie, I don't know what all the complaining is about. I recommend it. It's got good action, good characters, good suspense, and it makes you feel like you are submersed in this time period. This should easily go down as one of the best movies of the year.",8,2,4,22 March 2014
