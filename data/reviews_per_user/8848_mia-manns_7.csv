The Avengers," To be fair...
","If you haven't seen The Avengers yet, you must be completely immune to hype. Give yourself a pat on the shoulder.But to be fair, it is entertaining and worth the watch, especially if you're interested in witnessing a curious film trend I've been noticing lately that's pretty much formula for The Avengers. The trend is this: the beginning is smart, suspenseful, and witty, with a somewhat interesting story. For the end, you can just turn your brain right off. And people love it.We start out with characters who have interesting back stories to divulge, some weighty threats and the hilarious jokes you knew would be there the second you found out this would be directed and written by Joss Whedon. Tony Stark (Robert Downy Jr.) absolutely rapid-fires the hilarity, as expected, and Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) is a comedic accomplice. Who quickly vanishes from the story. The Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) hints at some dark secrets and it's not clear whether Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo) is a help or a big looming threat of letting loose and tearing everyone to pieces. Actually, if you've ever seen a movie before, it is pretty clear. Captain America (Chris Evans) had some potential because he's from WWII era, but was used mostly for jokes at the expense of his anachronisms; he was frozen for half of the past century so he doesn't really get modern cultural references, technology, etc. I can't stand Thor and I cannot believe what a joke his solo film looked like from the trailer, nor that Natalie Portman would get herself mixed up in that mess, but maybe that's just me. But the other Avengers are interesting and well- written. For the first half of the movie.What bothered many critics wasn't even a concern to me. In a search for something to be nit-picky about, lots of critics have complained that there was too much in-fighting between the heroes, who were clearly being manipulated to turn against one another by evil-mastermind Loki. However, this didn't take up much screen-time and was done in a well-written and believable way. I thought what they were bickering about was kind of reasonable. I would be a little upset too if my boss lied to me about developing nuclear weapons of mass destruction.I was led to believe that half of the movie would be the Avengers fighting each other (and when you say fighting with relation to Super Heroes, you think actual, physical fighting). Nope, it was just one scene of some very reasonable banter.Okay there is one fight scene between Thor and Iron Man that went on a little while, and I personally can't even keep my eyes open during action scenes with no dialogue, but I felt like it was justified and when you think about it, people want to see Thor go up against Iron Man. Again, not incredibly problematic.They were right about the enemy not having a very good, strong, reasonable or deep motivation for taking over Earth. This is another reason why I think we were given leave to turn our brains off after half of the movie. At the beginning, it looks like Loki might be a worthy and complex opponent. He has some qualms with the American belief in freedom. Kinda seemed like he was going somewhere with that. But he didn't, which makes it seem like a gimmicky attempt to make this bad guy stand out from Sauron or Darth Vader, which, while one-dimensional, were good villains because they stood for something metaphorical i.e. the dark side of humanity or the Germans in WWII. Loki's just evil for the sake of being evil. But you've already heard that.The real problem in this movie is that after all that time spent writing up interesting characters and weighty plot points that delve into issues like a possible limitless energy source and the dangers of nuclear war, actually managing to cover new territory on that front, and making a formidable enemy that should require something brilliantly clever to defeat, we get a really long extended fight scene, fixes that aren't believable and border on plot holes, a complete undermining of the big bad guy's abilities, not to mention some predictability. Oh boy, where do I start?The screenplay must have ended after The Avengers got to Manhattan. I'm gonna guess 2/3 into the screen time. From there on out, it's mostly one-liners. Yawn. I liked the flying things that made me cringe when they flew into the beautiful New York architecture that is now, in that fictional world, gone forever. I didn't like the all-brawn and no brains approach.",6,2,10,14 June 2012
Black Swan," Aronofsky's Black Swan (2010) review
","Another visually intense film from Darren Aronofsky, the director of Requiem for a Dream. I made the mistake of assuming this film would be more mainstream and therefore less horrifying than Requiem, but this film definitely goes just as far to push you to your limits. Before seeing it, a friend described it to me as 'hypersexual', and I have to agree with that. It left me a little bit afraid to be alone with myself, to be honest. An excellent psychological thriller to follow my Fight Club review. This is another film that I will pretend is anywhere close to science fiction because the psychological is manifested in reality in a stunning, yet fantastic way.To address a concern many of the fellows might have, I dragged my boyfriend to see this film with promises that it would be as incredible as Requiem, and he agrees with me that about halfway in it doesn't matter that it's a movie about ballet. Just in case you were worried. The music and dance really added visually to a great story, and I probably don't have to mention the parallels to the ballet of the swan queen or the black and white imagery. The ballet allows Aronofsky to continue to plague his films with stark and artistic images. He pulled it off beautifully.I won't give a plot synopsis because there are excellent ones all over the internet. What I will say is that while you know the basic story, you will be shocked at where it takes you. From the trailer, I thought I knew where this was going, but felt it would still be worth the ride. It turns out I was wrong, and without spoilers, let me just say that to enjoy this film thoroughly, forget everything you saw in the trailer and go at it anew. Watch Nina closely for the effect each subtle event has on her, and forget what the reviews have told you is going to happen.This is a movie about what can happen to a sweet girl in a viscous, competitive world, and I don't just mean the ballet. Nina is unnaturally innocent for her age, to the point of being emotionally immature, and the controlling forces in her life cause her to break free in a dark way that goes beyond what is expected for rebellious little girls. She becomes the Black Swan because it is expected of her to shed her innocence as she comes of age, but at the same time, her mother exerts a suffocated control over her, expecting her to be a child forever, and even Thomas, the artistic director of the show, is controlling while he pretends to free her. He has control over her sexuality as he forces her into an unhealthy relationship of the strong dominating over the weak.A great story of the mind, with excellent art direction and a very imaginative manifestation of the psyche. It's been a long time since a movie has glued me to the screen to the extent that I can forget my own existence for the entire third act.",Null,0,1,22 March 2011
Pan's Labyrinth," Captain Vidal in Pan's Labyrinth
","Pan's Labyrinth is an incredibly brutal film that will make you feel the harshness of the world, particularly because of the contrast with a beautiful fantasy. There is a realist story intertwined with a fantastic one, where the world of the adults is dark, cruel and without any justice, and Ofelia, as a child, is able to access a just and beautiful world if she overcomes dangerous obstacles. Her part of the story is the Fairy Tale. Captain Vidal is the bad guy for both the realist of the Spanish Civil War and the fairy tale of Ofelia's quest. His character really gets the idea across that there is no cosmic justice. Vidal represents the cold, irrational brutality of the world.He is overly villainous, creating an aspect of the realist story that is bordering on the fantastic. Del Torro gives us a bleak, hopeless movie that will leave you feeling dark. In the realist portion of the story, Vidal is one-dimensionally evil with explicitly sinister motives – he's a symbol for cruelty and lack of mercy in the world. One of the most memorable and gory scenes in the movie is when Vidal unjustly kills a man, and only afterwards checks the validity of the man's story. His reaction upon finding out that it was true? He reprimands his soldiers: 'Maybe you'll learn to search these ---holes properly before you come bothering me.' He shows no remorse. He's unrealistically evil because he is an embodiment of injustice. Vidal's unrealistic cruelty and malevolence is more fitting to Ofelia's fairy-tale.The fairy-tale archetype that Vidal exemplifies can exert irrational cruelty in a fantasy story – wicked witches poison princesses and that's just how it is. Just like the wicked witch, he has no hesitation or remorse for taking the life of Ofelia, just as cruel 'fate' can senselessly take the life of a child. There is no meaning for the loss of an innocent.Vidal commits acts of senseless, irrational and merciless violence. His character in both the realist story and the fairy tale embodies the idea of cosmic injustice. Tragedies occur without reason or meaning.",10,2,5,22 March 2011
The Butterfly Effect," Re-watching the Butterfly Effect
","'You can't change who people are without destroying who they were. 'Always a fun watch, if a little holey. Evan (Ashton Kutcher) has had something of a tragic life that has taken him away from his childhood friends and left them all miserable and alone, particularly his first love, Kayleigh (Amy Smart). As he nears completion of a psych undergrad, he begins to uncover the past, including memories that he'd 'blacked out' before and couldn't remember even moments after they happened. He soon finds that he can do more than revisit these blackout moments - he relives them with the ability to change them, and completely change the course of his life.It's a neat way to demonstration what Chaos Theory calls the Butterfly Effect - 'It has been said something as small as the flutter of a butterfly's wing can ultimately cause a typhoon halfway around the world.' By changing a moment in his past, Evan can completely re-write history and end up with a completely different life. (Spoilers beyond this point)The only thing is, where something like The Simpson's Treehouse of Horror satirizes the idea that squishing a bug in prehistoric times can change the course of human evolution, The Butterfly Effect goes the other direction and allows Evan to make really minor changes that don't effect where he ends up at all. For example, when he ends up in prison for the murder of Kayleigh's brother Tommy, he has to prove to his cell mate, Carlos, that he can go back to his past and make changes. He goes back to when he was 7 years old playing at school and draws a picture - which is part of the original timeline that we, the audience, already saw - and stabs spikes through both of his palms - which creates a changed timeline so that Carlos can see them instantly appear, as if a mark of God. If we're trying to demonstrate the butterfly effect here, shouldn't changing that day when he was 7 have some ripple of effect through his life so that his situation would be just a little bit different now? Whether he was taken to the nurse's office or the hospital, if his mother took him to the psychiatrist at a different time, if it made him more freaked out about his blackouts, if it changed his vision of himself or his attitude towards life in any way, wouldn't every event leading up to his prison sentence be somewhat eschewed? We're supposed to believe that he would still end up in the exact same prison cell with the same prison mate at the exact same moment and the only difference would be a new set of scars?Not to mention the nonsensicalness of having the scars appear instantaneously. Usually when Evan changes the past, he has altered the timeline leading up to the present, so he would have had those scars since he was seven and Carlos would have thought he'd always had them.'So now I need some information to make things right again.' 'There is no right!' 'That's bullshit. I'll send you a postcard when I made everything perfect again.'It's also interesting to note that no matter what Evan changes, he always ends up at the same University, with the same circle of friends and the same series of past events. Would Tommy really have still killed Crocket on the same day in the same circumstances after all of the earlier changes Evan made to the timeline? Would Evan's mom still move away to the same city in every situation and Evan still be a psych major at the same school? The movie pays up a little bit with the line 'Tomorrow I can wake up in a dirt farm in Bangladesh.' This is more in the spirit of chaos theory, I think. He really doesn't go far from his original path - the only difference is the mental and physical state of the people he cares about.Then again, for the sake of a unified plot and a movie that makes sense, it is probably for the best that he stays far away from Bangladesh. That would make for a very silly, Treehouse of Horroresque movie, where what we really get is a masterful, dramatic story with some neat sci-fi elements. Kutcher is really excellent in this movie, and has only very few 'Kelso moments'. The end resolution, while sad and unsatisfying, is exactly what we needed, because this is not a fairy tale. Life is making the best of the situation, and sometimes that means you can't make everything perfect.",Null,1,1,22 March 2011
Moulin Rouge!," Moulin Rouge - a musical with a few magical touches
","Moulin Rouge is a classic story of love-at-first-sight, with the twist of the hopeless romantic falling for a prostitute. I know we all claim to be tired of this sort of thing... but just stop whining and enjoy its charms. Please? For me? This film is complex enough to make that overdone plot line incredibly rich and fantastic. Christian is a writer who has come to Paris to experience the bohemian revolution, with a dedication to the ideals of 'truth, beauty, freedom and, above all things, love'. He falls in love with Satine, the Moulin Rouge's head starlette. The intriguing part of this story is what happens when Christian is mistaken for the Duke, an investor in the Moulin Rouge's production of Spectacular Spectacular, a play Christian is writing for a bunch of crazy bohemians. Satine wants to go from 'courtesan' (or the hooker with the prettiest singing voice) to actress, and the Moulin Rouge will subsequently transform from 'night club' (or glorified brothel) to theatre. But they need the Duke's money. He is creepily obsessed with Satine and demands that she... service... only him, in exchange for his funding. To make matters worse, he demands that the deeds to the Moulin Rouge be transfered to him in the case that there be any 'funny business', which of course there is, because she is giving Christian free 'service' behind the Duke's back.What's so good about Moulin Rouge? Well, to hook the classic rock lovers, it has showy covers of some really great hits - Your Song by Elton John, Heroes by David Bowie, Silly Love Songs by Paul McCartney, Roxanne by The Police, All You Need is Love by The Beatles, and The Show Must Go On by Queen. Also, Madonna, Nirvana, and Whitney Houston. So mostly great rock songs, but there is something for everyone. And who can forget Christina Aguilera with... OK I forget who... doing Lady Marmelade?The art direction in Moulin Rouge is fabulous... and weird. Very weird. It might take a second watch to really get into the weird comedy as well. Have a few drinks with your first watch and you'll soon find yourself chuckling at the absurd circumstances and nonsensical spectacles. Just trust me.Partway through there is a noticeable shift from ridiculous dance scenes to dramatic, tense ballads. Accompanying the shift in tone is Christian's transition from boy falling in puppy love to insanely jealous lover. Ewan McGreggor does a spectacular job here. Watch how long his goofy grin is plastered on that face, making him the picture of a man falling in love for the first time (don't you know it's gonna last) and then suddenly he is intense and crazed. Flashes of that innocent love can be seen in his expression later, making the transition incredibly flushed out and believable.You're really going to have to take a leap of faith with me if you haven't seen this. The first watch may even be too estranging, but just stay seated for the whole ride, and I promise you will like where you end up. Just... just trust me.",10,1,3,22 March 2011
Mulholland Drive," A tribute to the old art of film
","Ever watch a movie and when the credits roll feel that you have no idea what just happened? Actually, it doesn't happen much these days unless you fall asleep and miss part of the plot line. Hollywood really likes to spell it out these days. The last time I had this sensation was with 2001: A Space Odyssey. I watched this with perhaps not the best frame of mind for a challenging film and when it was over, I headed to IMDb to find an explanation for the past 141 minutes of my life. It's a rewatch in the sense that on the first watch, you will probably get lost. I mean, the flicks these days just really don't challenge you in the same way. I even watched it after the lecture in my Sci-Fi class and still felt pretty lost, despite the fact that I was decently well-prepared.I was not prepared in the least to watch Mulholland Dr. The only thing I knew about this movie is that it involved a woman with amnesia and took place in Los Angeles. Believe me, if you haven't seen it, just stop reading right now and watch it. It's really good, based on the 8.0 rating on IMDb, so you don't need to read a review to convince you. Just enter into the world of Mulholland Dr. the way I did without knowing a thing about it. It's best that way. Stop reading, right about, now... Well, now that we have gotten rid of those losers. Heh. Just kidding. In fact, maybe you're back after watching Mulholland Dr. and you've found yourself as lost as I was last night. If you're confused, rewatch the first 2 and a half minutes. Right after the jitterbug scene. The red sheets and the red pillow approaching. A troubled girl falls asleep and dreams that life is better, and that's the key that unlocks this film. The first two thirds or more are just a dream. The dream takes pieces of Diana's reality and combines them with fantasy, so that she can have the pretty life of Betty - a talented, sweet girl who falls in love with a woman with no memory of past wrongs. In her dream Diana is able to have Camilla back, to punish the man who stole her, and live the dream of being an actual good actress.It would have been nice to be able to resist the temptation to find the explanation, and watch Mulholland Dr. again to figure it out for myself, right? In fact, early after Diana awakens t I predicted that she had Camilla killed, but didn't understand how it was possible based on the events from the first half of the movie. As the credits rolled, it appeared that my theory was correct, but I still didn't understand why. This is the kind of thing we should get more from films, and perhaps the reason audiences don't get it on the first pass is that we're not used to thinking critically about what we're seeing. We're used to being handed the answers on a silver platter. I was really counting on something explaining to me that Diana had killed Camilla and was simply dreaming of what her life could have been as Betty Elms, which is why when I didn't understand the answer, I went straight to Google, as have many before me and many after me. Rather than continuing on like that, I'm going to endeavor to watch some of IMDb's highest rated films and seek out more confusing, mind-boggling, frustrating pieces of cinema and I hope you will join me.",10,2,3,22 March 2011
Inception," Why we love Inception
","It's the action packed heist movie with the best of special effects, taking place inside the psyche. It's Leonardo DiCaprio all intense and grown up. It's Ellen Page - who doesn't love that short little Canadian? It's the incredible and memorable Hans Zimmer score that blends perfectly with the world of the dream. It's the hard-hitting lines between the gunshots, the conceptual madness, and the art direction that taps into something most films can't ever touch - the human imagination. We love to see the rules of reality bent and snapped into pieces, and to know that it's all possible inside the mind.The idea of living inside a dream for years and years and lose very little real time is incredibly appealing, but we frown upon Cobb's addiction to his limbo world with Mal. This comes from something deeper than the appeal of fantasy, but the need for normalcy. We cling to reality more than we realize - it's why the Pevensie children come out of the wardrobe and are young again. No matter how much fantasy calls to us, we aren't satisfied until reality is restored and right again.We also love anything to do with psychology. Everyone does. I remember the first time I took a psych class I came home to my dad and told him I loved it and was thinking of going into psychology. He told me it was a phase, a phase that everyone goes through, and it will pass. We all love to learn more about the human mind because we come closer to unlocking more of ourselves than we otherwise could, and learning more about the people around us. Inception didn't need the special effects, music, writing and acting that it had to appeal to people. It needed those things to be a great film, but it would have had an audience with it's conception alone, even had it been terrible.I claimed once before that the writing in Inception was sub-par. I take that back. In recent weeks I've been cruising through Inception quotations and posting them on Twitter. I've found most of them to be very deep, and touch on something that is as appealing as the psych thriller plot. My favourite, I think, is when Mal tells Cobb, 'You keep telling yourself what you know. But what do you believe? What do you feel?' This strikes me as very insightful. There's more to the mind than facts and rational knowledge. Emotions are just as true as logical conclusions, and just as relevant to the nature of reality. Cobb may be right that they are in the dream world and they need to wake up, but if in the ambiguous ending he is still in the dream, he has chosen his emotional truth over reason.",10,1,7,22 March 2011
