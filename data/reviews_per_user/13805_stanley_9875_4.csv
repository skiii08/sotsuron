Raiders of the Lost Ark," Stanleys Stamp Of Approval: One Of The Greatest Action Movies Of All Time!!!
","I was a kid when i first saw this movie. I was just in it for the action, and not really the story. But I still loved it. Now that I am older, I have the DVD box set, and I love every frame of these three movies. George Lucas and Steven Spielberg knocked themselves out on this movie. With the DVD box set, I could definitely tell the difference in the lighting, color, surround sound, etc. It is all excellent. Good job George Lucas and Steven Spielberg, for making a film I enjoyed as a kid, I enjoy as a teen, and will enjoy as an adult. Go buy the DVD Box Set if you want something good to watch.-$tanley",10,0,1,31 December 2007
The Bourne Ultimatum," Stanleys Stamp Of Approval: Hands Down One Of The Best Action Movies
","I was a late bloomer, watching Bourne Identity and then Bourne Supremacy. They were great, and left me guessing. Then later, the Bourne Ultimatum rolls around, and it looked like a great piece of movie making. So I decided to go see it in theaters and was blown away. I love movie making, and I was as much in depth about how they did the making of the movie, like the stunts and all, rather than the movie itself. I saw it again, and I loved it just as much as the first time. I always laughed when, Roberts, I believe, was outsmarted by Bourne. Now, what I really like about Bourne, isn't like James Bond, who pulls out his granade launching watch (dramatization) and blows everyone away. Bourne uses his fighting skills, environment, and his head. For example, where he and Desh were fighting in the house, Bourne used a towel to defend himself against Deshs' razor. Bourne is a quick thinker, who knows what to do as soon as it happens. When Bourne was leading the reporter around the Waterloo Station, my friend and I were joking that Bourne had Google Earth all in his head. But overall, an incredible film. Bravo to all who made this film happen. -$tanley",10,0,2,30 December 2007
28 Weeks Later," Stanleys Stamp Of Approval: Excellent, Smart, The Best Zombie Movie I Have Ever Seen
","I saw 28 Days Later, and I loved it. It was scary, bloody, and a job well done. Then I saw a commercial for 28 Weeks Later, and I felt my pulse quicken. I saw it in theaters, and I was NOT disappointed. I walked out of the theater with a smile on my face. It was the absolute coolest zombie film I have ever seen. The helicopter scene, where a helicopters blades take out a field of zombies, kept running through my mind. It was extremely well done. The whole movie was well done. I would have loved to help film this movie. If your a fan of horror/zombie films, your hands may be shaking right now. You have good reason to! Go out and rent the movie! Im not going to tell you any more, because I want you to enjoy this movie at its fullest. Are you still sitting here!? -$tanley",10,2,5,31 December 2007
Avatar," I Can't Describe How This Movie Made Me Feel
","Since the first commercial of this movie, I knew it would be something that I wouldn't forget when I go to see it. Let's start off by saying I have an imagination that is intrigued with space. I dream about being on different planets and meeting Avatar type 'aliens' there that are human type but with slight differences (also like Avatar, like the ears, nose, tail, etc.), and I love to make up new adventures of where I'm at and what will happen. Anyways I saw the movie the first night it came out where I was, and this movie made me feel feelings I couldn't describe. The way the Na'vi people were designed, the planet, creatures, story... all things I would dream up inside my head. So not only did I like this movie just because it was a great flick, I felt in touch with Jake and how he saw everything and what he did. Movies like this are what makes me want to keep coming back to see it again and again and again. The planet Pandora was spectacular! I saw this movie in IMAX and in 3-D and the planet looked spectacular! The way everything glowed at night, how different it was satisfied my imagination. There was something about the Na'vi people that made me feel in touch with them. The way they are designed, like a human but with different ears, nose, a tail, and big glassy yellow eyes. Their bodies were brilliantly crafted, with their blue skin, tattoo-ish designs over their entire body, and the way they had spots that glowed in the dark in a artistic fashion. They fascinated me, and the way they treated each other was someplace I wish I could be. They were all in harmony with each other and Eywa, (which is basically like mother earth, so how they treat the forest and creatures). As soon as I saw Neytiri, my feelings were overwhelming. They were taking my adventures in my head to my level! I have dreamt of meeting one of the 'alien' type females and developing a relationship, not all about sex as most people would have it, but getting to know her and learn their ways, sharing emotions with each other. Some might call me weird for saying that, but thats just me. The story satisfied me as well. There was a lot of suspense, action, drama, romance and a little bit of humor thrown in there to keep me sitting on the edge of my seat or wishing this was true. James Cameron did an amazing job when he wrote the script for this film in 1994, and made the right decision to wait until technology caught up with his script so it would be amazing. Brilliantly done movie, 10/10, go see it!",10,8,17,20 December 2009
