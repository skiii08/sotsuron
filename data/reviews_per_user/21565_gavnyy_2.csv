Hereditary," It meets expectations and is worth the watch
","This is a great movie that is unlike all other horror/suspense movies out right now. It is worth watching and it will keep you guessing while on the edge of your seat. So go in with no expectations, stay patient and ready to go on a rollercoaster of emotions and fear. The conclusion is intense and it really leaves you thinking.....give it a shot for sure",9,2,4,18 September 2018
It Follows," If you took all of the adult actors ever, they still would not have sucked more balls then this movie
","This movie was created just to enter film history as the first full feature film with nationwide distribution to feature ball gargling and steamy chest dumps for its entirety....this movie is the reason there are wholes in the ozone, the ice caps are melting, carrot top looks like he does and why the gulf of tonkin happened. Don't watch it.",1,1,5,23 July 2017
