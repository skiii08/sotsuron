Airlift," Steals Hearts!
","After Bajrangi Bhaijaan, this one is the next heart stealer! In an industry where good films are not as often coming, movies like these are hugely treasured. Airlift is a real story where humanity is celebrated, and a movie on humanity needs to strike the right chord to enter the audience's hearts. And this one very memorably goes! Akshay Kumar gives his heart and soul to the role and is a huge reason why the movie achieves its heights. The screenplay and direction are top notch, and the music is very hum worthy. And best thing, it felt like it ended early as audiences were wanting more. Seriously Indian cinema standards will take a rise more with this movie. Highly recommended watch!",10,60,74,22 January 2016
The Martian," Entertaining, Dramatic and fun!
","Seriously reading all the reviews here, I thought this was one of the most hated films. But I watched it and..... I loved it! The drama was so entertaining. And I almost shed that happy tear when they announced 'We got him (Watney)....'. This was a human emotion drama with a sci-fi backdrop. Why do Americans take their movies so seriously? Or anyone for that matter? I in fact felt that certain places could have been injected with some more drama (e.g. people finding out Watney is still alive, etc.). Matt Damon was fantastic, and so was his rest of the crew. The people who played the NASA heads and all did a great job. This is a popcorn flick and it super entertains. If you are the emotional types, have some handkerfs available.",9,1,3,20 February 2016
