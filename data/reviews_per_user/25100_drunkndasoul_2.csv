Iron Man 3," It was bound to happen....BUT not a bad movie in general
","There are a ton of spoilers in this so don't read if you don't like knowing what happens!!!!! I gave the movie a 7 out of 10 only because even though I'm a huge fan of the comics and the characters themselves i looked at it also from a non fan point of view. The bad reviews i can only say were right about a couple things but we'll get to that.Pros: Loved the visuals and the grittier side of the series.Thought that the suits were awesome and played a very proper roll in the end.It showed how Tony Stark comes back after losing everything and made him very vulnerable.I liked that his suit kept breaking and he had issues with it through out the movie because it showed he had weaknesses and showed really how much his mental state from the avengers crisis messed with his mind in every aspect.Pepper Potts gets a bit of iconic action and does it very well.Overall it just was a good movie from a non fan point of view.Cons: Now the biggest thing i think everyone knows by now was The Mandarin not being well.. the Mandarin..... He was just a knock off actor that had his face and was British or something.It would have worked in my opinion if it wasn't such a huge nemesis of Iron Man and such a huge villain. I have disagree it was a clever idea for them to pull a quick one on every one. It pretty much was a slap in the face to all fans.Its just something you don't do and hard to watch such a great villain go down the drain. The Mandarin would have been a much bigger bash than having a character who pretty much a nobody in the comics and wasn't created until like 8 years ago in the comics..... awful. The Mandarin and the Ten Rings is much more interesting.The second most confusing part was the ending..... why is he putting up his suits and calling it a day??? He has to big of an ego to quit and it just doesn't seem right especially if he is going to be in the Avengers 2 movie.Iron Patriot is not even suppose to be Rhodes..... all i have to say about that And the after credit seemed very pointless considering there is not Incredible Hulk 2 movie in the works and you would have thought they would use it to hype of the next movie or another chain of events to the Avengers 2......I feel like the only way i could ever give this movie a higher score than 7 is if in the Avengers 2 they used the REAL Mandarin and it shows some kind of connecting plot of how he comes about to be a/or one of the villains in Avengers 2 O and by the way tooooo any Lethal Weapon similarities, Black... Think outside the box.",7,0,2,4 May 2013
Alexander," Really?? Some of you people thought it was great??!!
","The only thing i give you people that liked this movie on Alexander which i won't even call him by his 'classic' name is that the relationships and story of his life. Being one of those 'stupid' people or 'stupid American' i didn't like this movie for the lack of combat and the showing of his great reign as King!!! The showed plenty of personal life of him and a lot of him being sick , and enough how his soldiers suffered on long journeys,enough of graphic shots but where was the the great battle fights and awesome reign..... you could have added all the other stuff and still had room for the 2 main things that were pretty much left out. I seriously almost walked out half way through the movie theater.(which would be the only movie i would have) Sorry but like one person said already, how can you have so many great actor/actresses names and such a bad film. It was awkwardly boring and painfully too long for me to be interested in anything that was going on. I wouldn't call the 'American critics' stupid on this one... your just missing the big picture that we are seeing that makes Alexander ----- well great. Not his sexual preference, not him being sick , and not the fact it showed how much him and his soldiers were suffering. It was awful sorry.",3,1,2,31 May 2011
