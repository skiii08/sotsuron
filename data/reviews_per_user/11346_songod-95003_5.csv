The Blair Witch Project," I feel for this film...
","Celebrated like no other when released, well, before released actually thanks to a then groundbreaking internet and media campaign, it has since become the whipping boy for the entire 'found footage' genre that followed.Films, usually awful, cashed in on the success of 'Blair Witch'. Some gems emerged, like 'Utopia Report', 'Grave Encounters', and 'The Last Exorcism'; but most were, as stated, awful. Predictable, boring, pointless. And most fan-boy reviewers blame 'The Blair Witch Project' for these dreadful knock-offs.None of that applies. Thirty years after it's debut the film is still unnerving. It it plays on your primal fears of the dark, being lost, and being followed by something unknown. That makes the film truly frightening. Not a jump scare to be seen.My only issue, and one that has been an issue from the first time I saw it, is Mike tossing the map. It would have played better if the map simply vanished. Making Mike the idiot for thinking it pointless and thus tossing it in the creek really wasn't needed to amp up the discord between the three. In fact, he soon was back in good graces as Josh and Heather continued to fight each other. Had the map simply vanished, it could have been attributed to the witch.While not the very first found footage film it is the best.",8,1,2,21 October 2019
Nightcrawler," Truly amazing that... (mild spoiler)
","I find it truly amazing that Jake Gyllenhaal did not win nor was even nominated for an Oscar for this stunning performance as Louis Bloom. Makes me wonder how much of who gets nominated and who wins rides on insider politics and not on merit. Or how many Oscar noms and wins are 'gifts' in the respect that either an actor has a catalog of wonderful performances and has never won (Henry Fonda comes to mind for 'On Golden Pond')or the effort put into as role somehow makes it an Oscar winning performance (Leo DiCaprio in 'The Revenant').Gyllenhaal becomes his character; a feral, single minded, means justify the end 'bottom feeder' catering to the worst in humanity - our seemingly built in need to view others pain. He sees nothing at all wrong with what he does or how he goes about it. Easily he is most believable sociopath I have seen on film. In a performance marked by many stand out moments perhaps the most galvanizing one is not an action sequence but a quiet moment (before a storm) where he tells an employee that 'Maybe my problem isn't that I don't understand people, but that I don't like them.'How his work was over looked for an Oscar is beyond what good acting warrants and indeed must fall within the machinery of Hollywood backroom politics. Going by IMDb, he was nominated for outstanding acting by just about every other award given in entertainment except the Academy. Maybe perhaps his Lou Bloom was too good and looking at this work, for Hollywood, was like looking into the darkest darkness; understanding the reflection they saw in it was themselves.",8,1,1,1 May 2017
Midsommar," What Happened To...
","...Simon's girlfriend Connie? Last we saw of her was when she learned Simon
left without her but the truck (that only had room for two) would be right back for her.Well we learn Simon did not leave and was killed but we never saw what became of Connie. I assume like all the 'guests' she was done away with, but never saw how or saw her corpse. But I did not do a body count in the temple so... maybe she was there.In a movie with a close to three hour running time there should be no gaps.",8,1,2,9 December 2019
The Descent," Into the Heart of Darkness
","Is 'The Descent' a horror movie? Yes. But it is also an adventure, action, thriller, and a drama film as well. Does it work on all those levels? Yes.The movie hits the ground running and does not let up until the end credits roll. And what ending you get depends on the version you see. I recommend the uncut unrated which gives the film a fitting ending; absolving it of any need for a sequel.Yes, there was a sequel. Yes it ruined the whole thing. It added nothing useful. In fact what it added, detracted! I'd like to pretend it never happened and I never saw 'The Descent II'This original film is a masterwork solid stand alone nightmare. The best part about it is that it could all really happen; sans the horror aspect. Tho... who knows, right??Only issue I had in all the viewings I have given this gem, is in the darkness of the caves, you cannot clearly tell who is who. This leads to some confusion over who is a victim and who is surviving. Not a show stopper as soon all is made clear.Like 'The Children', 'The Descent' grabs you from the start and does not let go. Gratefully no sequel was made for 'The Children'!",9,0,0,13 June 2020
It Chapter Two," Breaks horrors cardinal rule
","Well my cardinal rule for both horror and comedy films. Neither ought to run longer than 90 minutes. Once you push towards 120, two hours, you're in danger of overstaying your welcome.This film runs two hours and 44 minutes. No matter how good the acting, the production, etc; the duration kills it.",5,1,2,17 October 2019
