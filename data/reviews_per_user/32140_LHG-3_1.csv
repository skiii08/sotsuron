Scarface," Not so good
","This is a well executed, but nonetheless extremely overrated movie.  I do not see what warrants a status as a classic there.  Certainly, the later Carlito's Way is much better in many ways.  The characters are poorly developed and one dimensional.  The story is not interesting and as predictable as it gets.  I understand that some aspects of Scarface must have been somewhat groundbreaking at the time, but I still suspect that much of its success is due to the hyping of its violence.  The acting is so-so, and Pacino is miscast as an unsophisticated thug and refugee.  The only redeeming value of this movie is its classic, kitshy disco soundtrack. There has to be better latino mob movies.  Carlito's Way is one for sure.",7,1,3,10 May 2004
