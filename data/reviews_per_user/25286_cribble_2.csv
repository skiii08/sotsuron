It," Not as good as I was hoping
","I've read the book more times than I can count and I am a fan of the 1990 TV series. They made some improvements over the 1990 series, but also screwed up some of the good things from the 1990 series. The acting was good but the story was bland and I never felt the closeness the losers were supposed to have in the story. The 1990 film, while corny to today's standards, did a much better job with the kids' back stories and you knew why Henry Bowers hated them so much. This movie just felt rushed and thrown together haphazardly. Moving the film to the 80's really backed them into a corner as far as how the story would play out relative to the source material. The apocalyptic rock fight was anything but dramatic and they actually made it humorous which is 180 degrees the wrong direction. It wouldn't have been bad as a stand-alone film but calling it Stephen King's IT is not really accurate. 6 of 10 because the acting was done well.",6,8,16,13 September 2017
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire," Not as good as the first
",The second installment of the Hunger Games Trilogy was really a bit of a letdown. I was anticipating a really good movie after reading all of the rave reviews on IMDb but was sorely disappointed. The first half of the movie moves really slow and by the time you get to the action scenes at the end of the movie it feels rushed. The movie probably needed an extra 30 minutes or so in order to give you a better feel for the new characters introduced in this movie. They deviated from the book in several scenes but nothing that was too horribly distorted. The acting in this movie also took a step back. The characters didn't seem as believable in this film and you don't get enough time for this movie to develop the supporting roles. Overall it was okay but it was by far the best book and unfortunately it fell way short of expectations.,6,11,28,6 December 2013
