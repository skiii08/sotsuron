Deja Vu," Tightly written thriller
","This is a tightly written time travel thriller that holds together, with all loose ends tied up. The explanation for the device is a little unbelievable, but hey, it's the movies. Unlike Premonition, which had so many plot inconsistencies that made the film unwatchable, the writers of this screenplay clearly gave their plot line a lot of thought. The director gives you subtle clues throughout the movie that connect events and link them to the plot, so it's possible to keep up with the action without getting too confused, but it does keep you guessing. All in all, a cleverly written sci-fi drama that holds your interest. Denzel, as usual, holds the movie together with another great performance.",9,1,2,19 January 2008
My Neighbor Totoro," Wonderful
","My Neighbor Totoro is one of those truly wonderful films that transcend the words 'heartwarming' and 'joyful.' This is a movie that any human from 5 to 95 can enjoy. There is something truly powerful and transcendent about happiness and innocence; and Totoro is a reminder that there is something happy and joyful inside all of us that is truly our strength, and the basis for life itself. Totoro is a superior movie that stands on its own, without reference to pop-culture tawdriness, melodrama, or mindless violence. Totoro is a great barometer for friends and relationships. If you have doubts about the sanity of anybody you know, play this movie for them. Haters, anti-social types, and people with indelible character flaws won't like this movie, and you can dump them!And oh by the way, the animation is awesome.",10,0,1,27 February 2010
Mulholland Drive," Ridiculous
","A psychotic, irrational and meaningless plot with so many film gimmicks it's hard to keep track of anything. I don't think the director (David Lynch) had a clue what the writer(David Lynch) wanted to say, if he wanted to say anything. Completely pointless. As a friend of mine who saw the movie with me said: 'I want those 2 hours of my life back.' The only bright spot for me was the performance of Naomi Watts.",1,4,10,13 April 2002
Mulholland Drive," A Glorification of Psychosis
","David Lynch is a master film maker, no question about that. But I guess life according to Lynch, or at least this movie, is: start out happy and cheerful, and end up killing yourself. I'm so tired of 'critically acclaimed' movies that are all about disconnecting from life. According to this theory, messing up your life is the only alternative because that's what 'reality' is. Well, if you're a fan of meaningless glorification of psychosis, then this is the film for you. A lot of clever film gimmicks, quirky editing, and a film noir, almost a dreamlike feel, characterizes this movie. I will say that  Naomi Watts is terrific and shows off her versatility, playing the full range of emotions effortlessly. It's almost worth it to sit through this jumble of disconnected scenes to see her performance. But what a waste of time for such a pointless motif as this film has. As a friend of mine who watched the movie with me said: 'I want those two hours of my life back.'",1,3,8,14 April 2002
Avatar," A true spectacular
","Many viewers will simply go gaga at the special effects in this movie, which are, frankly, unbelievable. Although it is worthwhile seeing the movie just for that, it is a trivial and superficial view of Avatar. The movie is really a battle between those who believe in life, and those who will sacrifice life for profit. There is evil in the world, and it is graphically displayed in the RDA corporation's willingness to kill as often as necessary to obtain a precious metal that will feed their stupid, mindless, machine culture. Do you believe in life or do you believe in death? In which direction will the human race go, toward more mechanization, hierarchy, and conflict (which represents a contempt for life) or towards a higher consciousness? These are the questions Avatar asks, and the answer lies within you.",9,0,1,6 February 2010
