Requiem for a Dream," One horrifying realistic flick
",I watched this one this week end and i just LOVED it. When the move ended i had a double feeling. I absolutely loved the movie but at the same time it gave me kind of a sick feeling over the realistic events in it.I recommend it to everyone that doesn't have a week stomach.,9,0,0,24 April 2003
