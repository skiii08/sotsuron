50 First Dates," In a word: Bad
","While this movie did have a couple ( and I mean just a couple ) good laughs, mostly it was filled with juvenile, toilet humor ( not that this is always bad ) which had nothing to do with the story itself. It looked to me like the main story wasn't long enough, so all kinds of dumb jokes were thrown in to stretch it out. Rob Schneider's role should have been completely left on the editing room floor - added absolutely nothing to the story. I suppose that is what I found very disappointing about this movie - it started out with an interesting idea, but got bogged down in the usual dumb jokes that usually fill an Adam Sandler movie. I really expected a lot better from both of them after 'The Wedding Singer' ( by far, Sandler's best movie ).",3,6,15,29 February 2004
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," Surprisingly Good
","Although I had expectations ( from watching the trailers ) that this might be a good movie, I was still surprised that it's as good as it is. The story is actually more complex than I had expected, involving cursed pirates and their quest to rid themselves of the curse. I won't say more than that so as not to spoil it if you haven't seen it.There aren't as many action scenes as I had thought there would be in a pirate movie, but the ones that are in the movie were very fun and enjoyable. After seeing it, I think it had the right balance of action and drama. There are also, of course, a lot of funny bits interspersed between the action and drama. Some really good special effects also add to the enjoyment of this movie.I wasn't much of a fan of Johnny Depp until I saw this movie. I think he deserved to win the Academy Award for best actor. It's largely because of his performance, IMO, that the movie was so good. Most of the supporting cast did well, mind you, just that Johnny Depp stood high above the rest. I did find Orlando Bloom's performance a bit wooden, but other than that the acting was good.Basically, it's a really fun movie and I'd give it about 8 out of 10",8,227,282,4 September 2004
The Mummy," Fun movie
","This movie is not deep and the characters are cartoon like, but still it's a lot of fun. Let's face it, this is a horror/adventure movie, which are seldom thought of as great movies. The movie is loosely based on the original with Boris Carloff ( which I have not seen ). The plot revolves around a high priest named Imhotep, who, 2000 years ago, had an affair with the Pharoah's wife and, upon being caught, Imhotep and the Pharoah's wife kill the Pharoah. Imhotep escapes and the Pharoah's wife kills herself thinking that Imhotep will revive her. He tries to do just that but is interrupted by Pharoah's henchmen who mummify Imhotep and bury him alive. 2000 years later, a band of fortune hunters stumble upon the crypt and accidentally bring the mummy back to life. The rest of the movie deals with trying to destroy the mummy before he fully regenerates and completes his plan to revive the Pharoah's wife.The movie features spectacular special effects and a surprisingly good performance from Brendan Fraser as an Indiana Jones type adventurer. In fact, if you liked the Indiana Jones movies, you'll love this movie also. Again, don't look for any deep themes or rounded characters - you won't find them in this movie, but you will find lots of fun and high adventure in this movie.",9,0,0,8 September 2002
Lost in Translation," What's the big deal?
","Um, maybe I missed something, but I really don't see what all the hype is about this movie. It's one of those movies that critics seem to like and awards go to, but is Boring with a capital B. The plot looks like it was put together by throwing darts at a dartboard to decide what would happen next. It's kind of like following an average person around for a couple days - let's face it, the average person's average day is a bore. True, once in awhile something interesting happens to all of us, but this movie chose to focus on the days where nothing really interesting happens. I'll give it that it's quite different, but different isn't necessarily good, which is the case here, IMO.",5,0,1,29 February 2004
Spider-Man," Good movie
","While no movie can match the hype it generates, this movie is still pretty good. The movie follows the beginnings of Spider-Man ( I hate the hyphen ) and his ultimate battle with The Goblin, played very well by Willem Defoe. Of course, the special effects take center stage and basically make the movie and we see some of the best special effects ever done in a movie to date. The movie, overall, measures up to the best of the comic book super hero movies and, if nothing else, a very entertaining way to spend a couple hours. If you enjoy these type of movies, you won't be disappointed. I only had a couple of problems with the movie. One, the action sequences were often so quick you couldn't really get a good look at Spider-Man. Two, as Peter Parker, Tobey Maquire was near perfectly cast, but as Spider-Man, he left something to be desired. It was the voice. That squeeky voice works fine as Peter Parker, but, as in the classic cartoon, with the mask on, his voice should have sounded deeper and more manly like. This would have been very easy to do by using a voice over with another actor with a similar but deeper sounding voice. Many die hard Spider-Man fans were disappointed, also, with the web shooter, which in the movie was the result of a mutation from the radioactive spider. I had no problem with that and thought it was, actually, a good idea. Anyway, if you see it with the right expectation, a live action version of a cartoon, and have enjoyed those types of movies in the past, you'll like this one quite a lot.",8,0,0,8 September 2002
School of Rock," so-so comedy
","I wasn't really impressed with this movie. It was somewhat of an original idea ( teaching the kids about rock n' roll ), but did use the teacher-who-frees-the-minds-of-his-students theme, which I've seen a few times before ( 'Dead Poet's Society', for example ). The dialogue was smart and cleaver, which is a plus. I didn't find it all that funny, though. A few good laughs, but not as funny as the better comedies I've seen. I think the movie would have been a lot better if the kids had learned a few other classic rock songs ( I imagine the cost of using those songs was the reason there weren't ). Most of the performances by the kids were good, which is usually the downfall of movies featuring lots of kids. All in all, a little above average comedy.",6,2,4,7 March 2004
Groundhog Day," Interesting as well as entertaining (may contain spoilers)
","The movie 'Dead Poet's Society' referred to a poem called 'To the Virgins, to Make Much of Time', which is known as a 'carpe deim poem'. Carpe deim is latin for 'sieze the day'. This is a major theme in Groundhog Day.     Bill Murray plays, weatherman, Phil Conners - a cynical, bad tempered man who, each year, has to visit Pugsatawny to see if the Groundhog will see his shadow. We watch him go through the day in a 'let's get this over with and get the hell out of here' attitude only to find he's stuck there for the night due to a snow storm. He wakes up the next day to find, to his dismay, that it's Groundhog day all over again. This cycle is repeated endlessly throughout the movie, until he learns to 'sieze the day' and make the most of it. What makes this movie good is that it exploits an interesting theme( look at the bright side and/or make the most of the day ) as well as entertains. When he realizes what's going on and gets used to the idea ( after 2 or 3 times of reliving the same day )he does what many of us would : take advantage of the situation. My favorite is asking several blunt questions about what school an attractive woman he doesn't know went to and who was her teacher and so on and then the next day ( which of course is groundhog day again ) pretending to know her by using the information he got the last time around. After the fun and games, though, he focuses on how to get out of the cycle. He tries to kill himself in several different ways, which doesn't work. It's only when he uses the time in an unselfish/make-the-most-of-the-day manner that the cycle is broken. This is another one of those movies that you can watch over and over again ( ironic, hey? lol ) and still enjoy.",9,0,0,14 February 2004
Pulp Fiction," A different kind of movie
","Tarentino is very good at breaking the rules and doing his own thing with movies. It's been tried many times, but, for some reason, Tarentino can pull it off time after time. I'm sure you haven't seen a movie quite like this one before.It's actually a bunch of stories put together in one movie, but, yet, they're all connected. It's not that any of the stories are completely original, it's just the way the movie is put together. It's non linear, for one thing. You see the end of the story at the beginning of the movie and the rest of the scenes are out of place as well, but somehow it all works. In the hands of someone other than Tarentino, I'm sure it would have been a huge mess.The thing that's best about Tarentino is the dialog. He has the best knack out of all writers to create believable everyday dialog that's still interesting. As a person who's dabbled in writing, it is difficult to create good, authentic dialog, without boring the reader. If you've ever listened to two people talk in a restaurant or something, you'll know what I mean - dull as a felt tip marker. Tarentino can create authentic sounding dialog without making it boring. This movie is worth watching just for that.The acting was very well done and most of the characters were original and non-stereotyped. Travolta was particularly good and showed he was capable of doing drama as well as comedies and musicals.If you want to see something different, this is one you don't want to miss. It well deserves to be in the top 100 on the IMDb list.",9,1,2,4 September 2004
The Matrix Reloaded," A very poor sequel
","I was extremely disappointed in this movie. My review for the original gave 9 out of 10. This sequel would not even get 5. The plot is the problem. What happened to the matrix? It was all but forgotten in the sequel and very well could have been any other action movie. What made the original movie unique was pretty much ignored in the sequel. There was a standard chase sequence which went on way, way too long and had no place in a matrix movie, as far as I'm concerned. And why did they feel the need to throw a romance into it? Not every action movie needs to have a romantic relationship just because there are two single available people in it.I can't complain about the acting - they did the best they could with poor material.The special effects were a little too much for my taste. It fell into the trap other sequels, like 'The Mummy Returns', have fallen into before - because the first movie is a success, they open up the purse strings and end up putting in a bunch of unnecessary special effects just because they can afford to.I disliked this movie so much, I haven't even bothered to see the third one. I suppose I will sooner or later just to see how the whole things ends, but I'm in no hurry to.",Null,0,1,3 October 2004
When Harry Met Sally...," THE Romantic Comedy
","Although romantic comedies were made before 'When Harry Met Sally...', it was the movie that invented the phrase. The movie is about the long, over more than ten years ( though the movie focuses on the last two years ), relationship between Harry and Sally who first meet on their car pooling trip to New York after graduating from university. It explores the question 'Can men and women really be friends?'. It's a whole lot of fun to watch them find out the answer to that question as well as to illustrate a lot of the differences between men and women in terms of wants and needs in a relationship. If you like romantic comedies, you really have to see the modern one that started them all.",8,1,2,14 February 2004
Shrek," Very good
","I have to say I was completely awed by the amazing 3D animation in this movie. Built on that is a solid story about an ogre named Shrek (Mike Meyers) who is sent on a quest by Lord Farquaad (John Lithgow) to rescue Princess Fiona ( Cameron Diaz ) from a fire breathing dragon so that Lord Farquaad can marry her and become king. Along for the ride is Donkey (Eddie Murphy). The voice acting is very well done (John Lithgow is my favorite) and the music and sound effects created a nice story book atmosphere. Cameo appearances by many classic fairy tale charcters also adds some laughs to the movie. This will, no doubt, become an animation classic in years to come.",9,1,2,16 May 2004
The Matrix," Very original
","What if the world around us was, in fact, a hologram? The Matrix is based on that idea and, because of that, is one of the most original movies I've ever seen. While the story isn't perfect, it's interesting and fast paced enough to keep you glued to your seat. It's one of those movies where you can't miss one minute or you'll be confused about what's happening next.The action sequences were particularly good. After finding out the truth, Neil (Keanu Reeves) is able to perform amazing feats once he realized the 'rules' aren't rules at all and can be bent to a point in the holographic world.I'm not a big fan of Keanu Reeves, but I thought he did a good job as did Laurence Fishburn and the rest of the cast. Hugo Weaving was great as agent Smith, who plays a computer controlled holographic projection who hunts down renegade humans who've stumbled onto the secret.Definitely worth watching even if you generally don't enjoy action films. I'd give it about 9 out of 10 mostly because of originality.",9,0,1,4 September 2004
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," DVD comment
","I shelled out the dough for the DVD versions of the original trilogy and wanted to comment on them. I'll stick to A New Hope, since that's the movie I'm reviewing. Overall, I love it. Looks great, and they really did a good job on making use of the 5.1 audio - spaceships flying from behind your head to the front, from side to side, etc; atmospheric sounds from all directions.Since, everyone mentions it, I'll also comment on the added scenes. They don't really bother me, it's just that they fall under the rule 'If it ain't broke, don't fix it.' I don't feel the additional scenes add anything important to the film. Did we really need to see the panoramic view of Tatooine? I was able to suspend my disbelief when I originally saw the film without that shot and believed Luke lived on a planet other than earth. Was the scene with Jabba necessary? Didn't add anything we didn't already know or learn in the later films. The extra creature shots for atmosphere. Okay, so they're nice, but, again, don't really add to the believability or the plot. Why put them in? To repeat, 'If it ain't broke, don't fix it.'. I know Lucas said that the way it is, is the way he envisioned it, but seeing as it was such a big hit, obviously lots of people were perfectly happy with it the way it was, which is why he should have just left it as is. Again, for the amount of time those extras last on screen, it doesn't really bother me. I just feel they were completely unnecessary and didn't add anything worthwhile to the story.If you're thinking of buying them, I say go for it even if you don't like the extra scenes (if you've seen them before on the VHS versions or on TV). The quality of the DVD transfer is awesome and you won't be disappointed with that aspect of the films.",10,0,0,3 October 2004
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," One of the best movies of all time
","I don't like to rate movies based on hype or box office receipts, so I'll stick to the movie itself. In case you live under a rock, the movie is about a young man, Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamil), who becomes involved in a quest to become a Jedi knight and rescue Princess Lea who has been kidnapped by Darth Vader. Obi Wan Kenobi (Alec Guiness) becomes his mentor and they employ Han Solo (Harrison Ford) and his sidekick, Chewbaca (Peter Meyhew) to take them to Alderon. Along for the ride are two androids, C3PO and R2D2, to add comic relief. When they discover that Alderon has been destroyed, they find their way to the Death Star - an Imperial weapon capable of wiping out a whole planet in one blast - and, after rescuing Princess Lea, join in the battle to destroy the Death Star.The movie is very well done, with amazing special effects that still stand up quite well even today. There are very good spaceship battles reminicent of world war I dog fights, as well as sword fighting using light sabers ( the traditional weapon of the Jedi Knights ). The idea for the movie is quite original, combining sci-fi with tales of camelot and world war I fighter combat. The plot is engaging, if somewhat predictable and the acting is top notch considering most of the cast were unknowns at the time.It's one of those movies that doesn't show its age and continues to gain young fans who's PARENTS weren't even born when it was originally released.I'm glad to hear it will finally be available on DVD soon and I'll definitely be adding it to my collection.",10,0,0,3 September 2004
Back to the Future," One of the best (includes spoilers!)
","This is one of those movies that shouldn't get a high rating, but is one of my favorites anyway. Generally, highly popular, sci-fi/adventure, movies are not thought of as great, but this is definitely an exception. Why is that? It's the script, IMO. I have yet to see such a brilliant and clever script since. Examples are: Marty's mom berating the behavior she herself was guilty of as a teenager; Marty creating a makeshift skateboard, which he is shown to be very adept at riding in the present, out of an old time scooter in 1955; George Mcfly punching out Biff turns George into a confident, successful writer and Biff into a stumbling oaf; and, of course, Marty inventing rock n roll. Every story writer/screenwriter should really study this script to see how the great ones are constructed.    Another reason this movie is so good is that the casting is as good as it can be. I really can't imagine any other actors in those roles.    Beyond that, the movie is just so much fun to watch - it's one of those movies I've seen a hundred times and still watch if it comes on TV.",10,1,2,14 February 2004
The Bourne Supremacy," Average Action Movie
","This movie was okay, but I wasn't overly impressed with it. If not for the over use of the hand held camera, which had me feeling seasick, I may have enjoyed it more. While such technique can add a sense of urgency to a film, when it used throughout 99% of the movie, it just becomes totally annoying. It distracts from what is happening in the scene. The car chases were particularly hard to watch and follow what was happening. They did use some interesting, original angles in some of the action sequences, but, again, with that shaky camera it didn't have the impact it could have had. I hope if there is another movie in the series, they will make much use of that old movie making rule: Use a tripod most of the time.",6,0,1,3 September 2004
Jurassic Park," Brilliant idea ( may contain spoilers )
","What makes this movie good is the idea behind it - what if you could bring extinct animals ( in this case, Dinosaurs of course ) back to life using DNA? It's one of those 'I wish I'd thought of that' ideas. Another thing that makes it good is it's the first Dinosaur movie ( that I know of ) to realistically portray dinosaurs ( due to exceptional visual effects ). The story revolves around, as mentioned, a rich entrepreneur using science to create a dinosaur theme park on a tropical island. He invites several 'experts' to the island to get approval at which point, due to a containment problem, the dinosaurs run loose and create havoc and terror for the humans. Again, the real value of this movie is the original idea behind it and the very good story built on the basic premise.",9,4,5,14 February 2004
