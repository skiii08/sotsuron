Iron Man 3," This one missed the mark...
","I guess you know it's not a good sign when you see the people from the previous showing come out, and they aren't laughing or even smiling but just kind of humbly walking out. I said 'oh noÂ…'Action wise this was nice to see in IMAX, and the action scenes are done very well and special effects are second to none, sadly that's about where the good ends. Also I should point out early on that this one is not so kid friendly. I expected to come out of this loving it and looking forward to taking my 9 & 11 year old kids to see it, but I am seriously second guessing that. This one is darker, more intense, shows much more graphic scenes and situations which are not as kid friendly and boarder on the Rated R scale.The flow wasn't really good, and some scenes I liked and others I about fell asleep, I didn't really care much about the side stories and just took away or needed to be edited down a bit more. The whole anxiety thing while I thought was an interesting addition totally fell flat and was not an issue at any critical moment in the film. It's really hard for me to dig into issues I didn't like but really can't without giving too much of the movie away.The non flowing story, the needless intensity of a few scenes. Probably one of my biggest gripes in this movie was the suits! While they looked cool they were just feasibly impossible, or at least the main one. Not to say that the previous 'Iron Man' suits were totally believable of course, but now he has a modular suit, which each piece can fly attach to him or whoever he points to, cinch itself together, and then when it runs out of power it can simply open itself all the way up so he can just crawl out? I'm sorry while it looks cool it's just too beyond the believable point. Not to mention his other suits were torn through like butter. I mean so much for the impenetrable suit of armor in this one where it could actually take a beating. I guess lastly I didn't really like the bad guy or his minions. I like Guy Pierce and thought he did a good job, but the fact that you didn't 'feel' for him nor really hate him it just made for a lack luster bad guy. While they had a cool power, again it was a little beyond the realm of believability. I know that sounds silly for me to say given the whole Marvel Universe of powers.I walked out similar to those who came out in the previous show. Thinking it was just okay. There were some great action sequences, I was bored at time and overall thought the story was ho hum. It wasn't one or two things, but quite a few. Either the story just wasn't that good or the director change wasn't a good one, or both",4,3,6,3 May 2013
Gravity," Visually stunning, so so story
","I went into this with pretty high expectations after hearing all the hype and it getting an 8.6 on IMDb. I love Sci-Fi's, space flicks so this was definitely up my ally.Visually this movie is pretty stunning. I've never seen so many beautiful pictures of the earth in a space movie. So in some sense it's similar to the old 2001 space odyssey or Avatar where it relies heavily on the visual aspect. But sadly for me I didn't find much more to it then that. The plot is very straight forward and for me seemed pretty hard to believe, even by 'Hollywood' standards. I saw this in the theater thinking visually it would be one of those movies best seen on the big screen, and in that aspect it was as again there are scenes which are pretty stunning if you're at all into celestial scenery.For me the story just got too unbelievable. It's not because she's a woman, but here you have Sandra's character, who is a green mission specialist, more or less a technician. Due to some chain reaction or something aboard a Russian satellite (of course, it's always the Russians right?) debris from it is flying around and disables their ship causing them to find another way home. My beef with this is think how big the earth is, well the orbit of earth is obviously much bigger, so we are to believe that some Russian satellite blows up presumably thousands of miles away yet in the entire vastness of the orbit of earth (think three dimensional here) that debris heads right in their path? And not once, not twice, but three times I think as it rotates around earth? So right there I was a bit turned off as nobody seems to really get how 'BIG' space is. Anyway if that wasn't bad enough somehow this first gen mission specialist gets propelled into space, rescued via Clooney who's wearing a thruster pack, then they travel to some other space station, where she gets on board within seconds of Hypoxia killing her, and disaster immediately strikes, yet she can quickly launch and pilot the escape vessel to a Chinese space station, which is pummeling towards earth, which she enters and quickly figures out how to launch the escape pod to. Yeah okay...Again the movie is 'okay' by my standards, certainly not an 8.6 although visually it is great, but we've come to expect that nowadays with technology and CGI being what it is, so outside of that the story itself is basically your typical sinking ship overcoming incredible odds survival kind of story and that's about it. I won't be renting this when it comes out on disk and if I catch it sometime for free I might watch it again, so that's how it ranks in my book.",6,1,3,21 October 2013
Captain Marvel," I thought it was entertaining
","It's certainly not without it's flaws, but overall I was entertained throughout the movie. The story & pace was good, action & effects were good. Anti-aging on Fury was really good, Coulson looked a little synthetic to me. The humor overall I thought worked, anything cat related was hysterical. One thing I like about movies if done right is when they leave you with questions, but it has to be done well. If you leave people with questions due to lazy writing, then that isn't cool, but if you walk away pondering things, then that's usually a good thing, at least I think soI didn't read any reviews before going to see this and honestly didn't go in with much in the way of expectations. Captain Marvel is a hero I'm not really familiar with. Lets face it she doesn't have the celebrity status as Hulk, Captain America, Iron Man & Thor. And I can't pretend to be a fan of Larson either, I only saw her in Kong which wasn't all that memorable, but mainly I'm indifferent to her as an actorAfter reading reviews, overwhelmingly which are negative I think they're a little harsh, most complain about Larson being wooden, which again I can't really comment on as I really don't know her or other works, I thought she did okay but admittedly I wasn't wowed over by her either.One concern I had going into this was all the talk about her being too powerful, which is true and a negative IMO and once she transitioned into Binary it was pretty much lights out for the bad guys. The main problem with this is I never felt like she could lose or be seriously hurt. Mainly just confined or blocked until she finally broke free, which is very different than feeling like she could actually be hurt or worse.I must admit I was confused with the tesseract and timeline details. I didn't quite grasp how supposedly it went into the drink with Cap America in the 40's, Howard Stark recovered it shortly after, and presumably it was in his / Shield's possession until Loki snatched it in the first Avengers. So the fact that it has such a dominant role in this movie perplexed me, but I guess after enough thought it more or less works out.All in all I thought it was entertaining, action packed & funny, which is my overall measuring stick, at least for these types of movies. Was it as memorable as Iron Man, Thor or the Avengers? No, but I put it in the same bracket as Ant Man. So maybe on the lower side when compared to the recent Marvel movies, but by no means a bad movie overall",7,1,3,9 March 2019
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," My favorite movie of the year!!!
","I have to be one of the biggest fans of this movie.  I loved every minute of it.  One word of caution though, it is rated PG and I think is produced by Disney, so even though there's raggedy pirates and sword fights, there is no cursing, nudity or bloody scenes.  That certainly didn't take away from it as far as I was concerned.Johnny Depp stole the show and played his part very well.  Geoffrey Rush (Barbossa) also did a fine job as did the rest of the cast.  I wasn't overly impressed with Orlando bloom, Keira Knightley, or Jack Davenport but they didn't do a poor job and certainly didn't take away from the film.  I guess you could say I liked all the pirates the best, the rest of the cast were decent fillers.I loved the humor flow of this movie, when I saw it in the theaters, I must have been the only person who had ever been on the Pirates of the Caribbean ride at Disneyland, as I completely busted up in the first jail scene, as well as a few other scenes, whereas no one else did.  I didn't find the movie the least bit scary, but I wouldn't show it to a very young kid either as it would probably scare the pants off them.  All in all this movie had great acting, mainly by the two characters I already mentioned, a decent story, great effects and battle / fight scenes, and a good overall flow.  I own this movie and have probably seen it more than 10 times.  By far the best movie I've seen this year, with Kill Bill and ROTK being a semi close second/third.I certainly hope they make a part II, and If they do, definitely keep Depp in, without him, it wouldn't have been the 10 /10 that I rated it.",Null,0,0,10 April 2004
Constantine," Started off good, then seemed to fall apart...
","The movie starts off pretty quick and fast paced. And I liked how it started off and liked the first 30-40 minutes. Then it kind of slows down and the flow of the movie starts to get inconsistent. I also thought around this point in the film the editor just went to sleep. Some scenes are just boring; others go on for too long, and still others just left me confused or seemed irrelevant. It was kind of sad how the beginning was very interesting but then it just kind of broke down. Towards the end it picks up a little bit and the ending isn't bad, but the lag / inconsistencies in the middle kind of made me loose interest.I guess the other aspect was that as the movie played out I seemed to understand less and less of what was going on. For one I didn't understand why Keanu was doomed to go to hell. If they explained it I kind of missed it. Also there were a ton of other things that either went explained or I just simply didn't understand or couldn't keep up. I do have hearing difficulties (which usually aren't an issue in a loud theater), but where I saw it had pathetic sound so maybe I just missed much of the dialog.I kind of got the general gist that there's this all mighty Dagger used by the devil or some other baddie, that when some poor Mexican stumbles onto it, he becomes immortal, possessed, and starts reeking havoc moving towards some goal or destination, seemingly possessing people and tilting the balance along the way. However this is where it starts to get weird and I start to loose focus on what's going on and why. I didn't understand why some people became possessed; I didn't understand why certain demons could now start crossing thresholds that Keanu kept spurting out 'They're not supposed to enter our realm.' I didn't understand what actually happened to the possessed guy carrying the dagger. I didn't understand the relevance of Gabriel and why he was played by a she and what he/she was trying to do in the very end with the dagger. The list of 'I don't understand' just goes on and on Unlike the matrix where everything is in riddles, this movie is either just not consistent at all, or just simply doesn't explain enough, or just expects the audience to follow a very weird non understandable plot, not sure which is the case.The story was interesting. Keanu is an exorcist who's job is to vanquish demons who cross the line, However since he's going to hell anyway, he has a very careless way about him, which IMO kind of hurts him in that it makes his acting look very bland like he simply just doesn't care, which I read a lot of complaints about. Personally I think it wasn't so much his acting as it was his character was very morbid, cold, resentful, and just down right miserable. So yeah, it came off like he wasn't much into it. The other actors in the film I thought did aright. There was no one in the film who I thought did an exceptional job in terms of acting So no acting awards from what I saw. The effects were pretty good. Nothing stellar, but they fit the bill. All in all it was an okay movie with some entertaining / interesting scenes, but by large I found it to be very confusing to the point of being frustrating. It's like when you keep taking breaks when watching a movie to the point where you just can't follow it anymore, except here I was in my seat the whole time. I've rarely had problems understanding movies, so it's not like I don't get half the movies I've seen. This one seemed to be an exception though If I see this movie again (by renting it later on I mean) it will only be to see if I can make more sense out of it as it just came and went when I saw it in the theater.",5,1,7,2 March 2005
Troy," Good solid movie. Go see it!
","I've seen a lot of criticism of this movie and even the group of people I went to see it with weren't taken back and all said the same thing 'its okay.' I on the other hand thought it was a good movie overall and give it a 7.5 / 10. So do yourself a favor and go see it on the big screen and make up your own mind as it's certainly not a waste. As far as the movie length it didn't feel too long to me and I thought the CGI wasn't all that noticeable (my two big worries going into it). However after recently reading an article on how it cost 200 million to make the movie and that a decent portion of it went into digitally enhancing brad pits muscles as well as cover up his bald spot, heh. Makes you wonder about the longevity of real actors Could a day come when a digital Brad Pitt could replace the real one?Anyway, I grew up with Greek mythology and was always fond of it. Being quite rusty though I went into this saying 'Isn't this the one with the wooden horse' but actually I did remember a little more than that prior to seeing it. So unfortunately I knew what was gonna happen in the Hector / Achilles fight, I knew how Achilles was going down, and how the main battle would end. So there wasn't much suspense in my corner for how things were going to play out.All that being said, I enjoyed the movie. I saw it after downing 4 long islands, so I was a bit sauced up, but I don't think that skewed my perception of the movie one way or the other. I thought that the flow, acting, battle sequences, and digital effects were all done nicely. As far as the story, I did notice that while the characters talked about the gods quite frequently, the directors more or less left the gods (or there actions) out. I guess with this kind of movie, you either have to go one way or another. But in the stories, I remember the gods playing a more active role. There were other subtleties in the movie that if you new the relevance, it would mean different things. For example, the Greeks killing the priests of the temple and p***ing off the gods (was present, but not very prominent in the movie). Nothing was ever really said of Achilles immortal body / mortal heal. He was just kind of depicted as a bad-ass warrior with no fear. So the end scene with Paris and Achilles, they stayed true with the arrow in the heal, but to an ignorant viewer, they wouldn't have noticed the relevance of it being the fatal arrow. Also, I thought I remember there being some special protective significance of the necklace given to Achilles by his mother, so when he gave it away to the slave girlHaving said it was a good movie, I did have a few complains / ideas that the movie could have done better on. From a movie perspective, they did kind of drop the ball on the whole Paris / Helen relationship which only was covered in the first few minutes of the movie. It would have been nice at least from a movie perspective to see something more develop here (struggling love develops in the midst of imminent death). I would have liked to see little more character development of Odysseus, he was a supporting character in the movie, but needed a little more stage time in my opinion as he was a fairly important character. Also Paris (Orlando bloom) didn't get much stage time at all, other than a few crucial scenes, though I don't remember how important he was in the stories. The movie pretty much boiled down to Achilles vs Hector, which is no bad thing. Only other complaint from me was on the music. In my opinion music can totally make or break a movie, much more so than people give credit to. In Troy, I wouldn't go so far as to say that the music was bad, it just seemed like in many scenes the music didn't capture the essence, and hence didn't really bring huge life or power to some scenes. Probably the biggest flaw for meFavorite scene  Very first duel with Achilles, beginning of the movie. Favorite character  Hector / Achilles being a close secondFinal remarks  As I said earlier, go see it. Though I've heard some mixed results, I haven't heard anyone say it was bad. See it if you are into epic battle movies or history or Greek mythology. See it if you like Brad Pitt as he's never looked better (digitally or not). Final thought, I think if the LOTR trilogy hadn't come out, this movie might have had a bit more impact. Problem is how do you shine next to that masterpiece.",Null,1,2,19 May 2004
The Prestige," Actually I didn't like it much at all
","Spoilers... It did have some interesting aspects to the movie, but overall I was bored by their rivalry and such. Plus I disliked borden's character altogether. He obviously killed Angier's wife for whatever reason and yet he's the one who got married, and had a kid, so for me the wrong guy was shot... I hate movies that leave you with a bad taste in your mouth and this one certainly did for me. It seems stupid to me that Borden had a twin brother that nobody knew about. And even more retarded was this cloning machine idea. More or less it's a grudge match against two magicians, and not much more. Scarlett was beautiful as always, but what a bitch she played IMO. Oh well i guess this is why you can't always go by the ratings... Better luck next time I guess",2,5,13,21 August 2007
The Expendables," Awesome movie!
","I kind of wish I would have saw this in the theater, but didn't turn out that way, as it is though I was able to watch it to where I could rewind and re-watch many of the good scenes in this movie which added a little more than the theatrical aspect actually, and there's very few movies which you can say that about...Sly was great of course and I've really grown to love admire him as an actor / body builder, especially at his age. I've always been a fan and although he had a rocky (no pun intended) middle carrier, I've thought his most recent stuff has been inspiring to say the least. Granted Jason was slightly more the 'main' character along side Stallone in this movie and the other supporting cast was great as well. I loved so many of the scenes all in all.To critique the film the only issues I had was it was a little too picture perfect in that no 'real' bad happens. Meaning none of the good guys actually bite it and all of the bad ones do. Now I don't know that it would have made for a better movie perhaps if one or two of the good guys had gotten knocked off, but at least two of the crew were lesser known actors who could have easily got laid off shall we say. I certainly hope Sly make a second movie as there are plenty of opportunities.Regarding Jet Lee, this was an interesting case in that I very much enjoy his movies over the years and think he's quite the bad ass, yet this movie put him and his size in place in which he wasn't superior or above the rest, and equally a credit to Dolph at the same time I suppose who I haven't seen much from in quite some time.Overall a great movie and I very much enjoyed it. A total guys movie for sure and with many great actors and of course the cameos from Arnold & Bruce. I hope to see more!",10,3,9,28 December 2010
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," Just okay for me.
","I tried not to read much prior, although I saw the high rating and read a few reviews, so maybe my expectations were too high going in. I thought it was better than the first one although I didn't think much of the first one. My biggest complaint is they really could have done with some better editing and cut it down 10-15 minutes as it just dragged in spots. While I very much like character development, some of those scenes just went on a little too long, but more than that character development should slowly build and set the stage of things to come and get you hyped up like in Avengers, however I just didn't get that same feeling here at all. I kind of liked the whole conspiracy gig at first, but at the same time it was a bit of a re-hash as well once things finally came out.The one thing I did really like is Cap was noticeably stronger in this one. Able to fall a long way down and land on solid ground, jump out of a plane from high up and land in the water with no chute, and able to take on a horde of people when seemingly outnumbered. So that was cool and I liked that they beefed him up quite a bit as he was little more than a pompous dork with a shield in Avengers. But my other gripe is I don't think he picked up a single weapon the entire movie. Yeah I get his shield can be an offensive weapon too, but I'm sorry when he's walking up to a horde of gunfire and his only defense is that shield, surely you would think a bullet or two might hit his legs, so that aspect of him only using his shield just kind of bugs me. Even in the first movie and Avengers he used guns to some extent, but not here that I can recall at allFar as other characters, Scarlet / Black Widow being in the movie was pretty much a treat as she's just sexy as hell and you know she'll never get her own movie, so why not put her in as a side kick whenever possible. I liked how they were kind of building something between her and Cap but it just fell flat and didn't go anywhere. Fury also got more air time in this which was good. Far as the Falcon, I really don't know what to think. You get introduced to him early and like Cap know he's a veteran and righteous guy, then don't see much of him and then all of a sudden Cap and Widow crash his pad when they're desperate and then all of a sudden this guy who you know nothing about is stashing a futuristic pair of wings and seemingly a semi super hero as well? What the hell??? It's not that I disliked him but it's just as if he came out of obscurity. They tried to develop his character a little from the beginning but didn't really do a good job IMHO. So kind of a mixed bag there. I liked the winter soldier although he was the one guy I wished got more air time. I like how they developed him and who knows where we'll go from here with all that. Can't really say anymore on that.To sum up, I saw it in IMAX 3D which is really the best possible viewing experience and overall I wasn't wowed over and left thinking it was just decent. I was bored through the first 20+ minutes, it started to get a little better. The whole conspiracy thing started off intriguing (intentionally leaving this vague here) but ultimately I just thought was kind of dumb upon the big reveal and one of those 'Okay, really' moments rather than a 'whoa that was a cool twist!' they were trying for. The final buildup and battle made for some decent action but was also very straight forward, unoriginal and telegraphed, so no big surprises there which would have been nice. I guess when you leave a movie and end up saying to the buddy you went with 'Well, the trailer for Spider man 2 looked awesome!' that kind of sums it up. Overall I rate as a 6/10 (5 being an average movie)",6,1,4,6 April 2014
Lost in Translation," More like Lost in Dudville, what gives???
","I must have completely missed the boat on this movie.  How it has an IMDB rating of 8 out of 10, I'll never quite understand.  I found this movie to be very slow and long feeling even though it was under 2 hours.  The acting was okay, but the mood of the whole movie was depressing, boring, slow, and utterly self defeating.  I mean you're watching a movie about two people who are board out of there scull, so how exciting can that be?  My two mistakes were, one I listened to the blockbuster guy and rented it.  And two just before I watched it I went to IMDB to see the rating for it.  When I saw it was an 8, I figured I was in for a treat.  I'd love to understand how this movie made such an impact because I just don't get it.  I should have listened to my instincts half way through when they were telling me to turn it off, but instead I watched on, hoping for something to happen, but it never did.I always wondered when I loved a movie and saw terrible reviews just bashing it up and down and how people could actually hate it.  Well I now understand because of this movie.  For me 2 out of 10.  I found it very dull, monotone, very thin plot / storyline, and above all, not entertaining in the least.",1,9,20,5 August 2004
Doctor Strange," Special effects second to none...
","Overall I liked the movie. Yes special effects plays a big aspect cause they were so good but it did make quite a difference, as it should in this movie. The acting was quite good and story pacing was good as well.Far as the negatives (and I'll show my age here) his 'Rocky training' sessions were flat out stupid and unbelievable. Hey director, you flat out failed here and I don't care what the comics say or how many books he read, this part of the movie sucked... I mean here you have some hot shot surgeon, brilliant no doubt, but is he a friggin ninja or expert spell castor? Not in the least and I don't care how smart the guy is, his disbelief in the 'non science' realm of things only gives him a handicap, yet he seems to race through basic training and ends up being the savior of a realm we ordinary humans can't see or even seem to know about?I'm willing to disbelieve a lot of things, because it's fantasy, because it's the movies, because it's Marvel movies, but at the end of the day it needs to tell a good story. With this movie overall I think they succeeded, but the whole middle 'powering up' aspect just fell flat on it's face and the more I write this review the more it bothers me. I mean he touched and grabbed or stole things that were sacred, yet no price other than humor was paid????It guess it worked, kinda....",6,2,3,26 November 2016
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Redeemed the 8th film
","Overall I walked out of the theater liking the movie and with a good feeling. Granted I went in with grim expectations after the 8th film just destroyed everything and didn't appear to leave much to work with. So on that grim basis I'm happy to say that I thought they came up with a good story to wrap up the 3rd trilogy.I thought it started off a little rocky, but after a bit grounded itself and found a good pace. Thankfully they avoided the dumb humor of the 8th movie and brought back the subtle humor that Star Wars is known for. The action & effects was good as well.I get it that Star Wars fans are a critical group, and nothing will ever live up to the original trilogy, but that said and considering how the 8th film left things I thought this 9th film did a good job of concluding things. So on that note if you're a Star Wars fan who was a bit burned by the 8th film (like me) don't listen to all the bad reviews and just go see this one",7,3,13,4 January 2020
Pacific Rim," Very entertaining
","When I see a movie I want to be entertained, that's it. Obviously it depends upon the material and type of movie, but lets get down to it, when you're going to see a good ol action flick, you just want to be entertained, see some good explosions and cool stuff and the goal is won.Now this movie? I've seen a lot of negative reviews and such and I'm struggling to find out where all the negativity stems from. Yes there are no famous characters in this flick, but it had a good story, good timing, awesome special effects and a great ending. BOOM!!! For the naysayers who say 'It's shallow', or whatever, frak them... This movie is great and I think they are just defending something else that didn't quite make it. I didn't see this in the theaters and wish I had given it's monstrosity far as 'big picture appeal' and it makes sense given the material. If you're at all in to Sci-Fi flicks, robots, aliens or any one of the three you'll probably love this like I did. Giving it 10 / 10 which I rarely do, somewhat because of the negativity stream, which again I simply do not understand, but this movie is a solid movie for what it is...See it on as big of screen and with the best of sound you have available!",10,35,57,16 November 2013
Baby Driver," My kind of movie
","My rating scale for movies is simple, how entertaining was it? And I found this very entertaining from start to finish. For one I liked the characters, I actually liked them all. They all had their quirks, but their intriguing points too. For me that's somewhat crucial in that if I can't get behind any of the character it just bounces me out of the movie. That was the case for me with the other recent movie I saw 'Uncut Gems' which got a great review score, but I couldn't stand it, primarily because I hated or couldn't relate to a single character. This film however was quite the opposite.The flow of the movie throughout was spot on. And as others have already pointed out the music is great and perfectly integrated into the film. For me though what I really loved was all the subtle and unexpected humor. Humor like this is awesome because while the film does take itself serious, it doesn't take itself too serious and has some unexpected and cheesy humor baked in that all works and totally hits the mark.I understand some negative reviews complaints about unrealistic aspects and things, but I didn't mind because again the film doesn't take itself too serious, so at least for me it was easy to suspect disbelief, where as with very serious movies it can be difficult, whereas here it's just kind of comical. That said about the only thing I wasn't fond of (hence the 9 out of 10) was a couple plot points such as the butcher scene or why Doc was at the hideout after the botched heist, but I could overlook these things for an otherwise great film.Bottom line, from the opening scene I was sucked in and found it more and more intriguing as it progressed into the 2nd & 3rd acts. A very enjoyable watch that I was happy to have stumbled upon",9,0,0,4 July 2020
The Village," Okay movie, but the worst of his lot IMO
","Seems like all of Shyamalan's movies tend to start off slow and build until the plot thickens as much as it can before revealing some earth shattering ending. This one was similar in many ways, the acting was good, and the cinema photography was good, the story was so so IMO. However this movie lacked something for me. Yes it was a slow developing & unwinding story (similar to his previous movies), but I guess I just failed to find enough interest in the plot and the characters as well because of that.Slight Spoilers ahead I found this movie more strange than entertaining. From the first few minutes you know something just isn't right with this town and you think you're watching some Star Trek episode about a pre warp civilization. And then comes the monster talk, the fear these villagers have of them, and the ambiance surrounding them. While it was semi intriguing, I started to loose interest when I found out certain things about the creatures and the main guy meets with an unfortunate circumstance. I didn't yet unravel the reason for much of this, but obviously I knew something was very odd. At this point I keep watching, semi interested in what's going to happen to the girl. I'm glad she killed the village idiot (too much jean mixing I guess) as he was just annoying. Then she finally reaches her destination and the whole plot twist comes spewing out like a drunk on new years eve. At this point I'm really loosing interest and saying to myself 'UmÂ… this is it???' The fire works I was expecting had been a few sparklers instead. Snap crackle and pop and then nothing. I started off with little interest, then it built up, then just when it was supposed to keep climbing as is my previous experiences with Shyamalan's movies have been, it started dropping off. Not because I couldn't believe what was unfolding or the possibility of it, I just found it stupid and a let down. Kind of like going on a treasure hunt only to find a secret decoder ring. It was at this point where I said, 'Man I watched this thing for 90 minutes just to find out this!?!!Clearly his worst film that I have seen. Either he's running out of original stories with cool twist endings, or I missed the boat on this one. That being said I wouldn't say it was horrible, and had I only watched the first half of it I might have better things to say about it, but the ending was a big let down for me and pretty much spoiled things leaving a bad taste in my mouth. If you are fans of his other movies, give it a try (when there's nothing better to rent), you might really like it. Then again you might see it like I did.",3,0,4,14 January 2005
Van Helsing," Great movie, at least for me
","This movie had a lot of hype prior to its release in the theaters, but upon hearing nothing but boo's from people who saw it not to mention seeing mediocre ratings from IMDb I waited till it was out on DVD. After finally seeing it I wished I had seen it in the theaters. I don't see what people disliked so much about this movie. The acting was good, the special effects and cinematography were pretty top notch, and the story was pretty involved, so what people hated so much about this movie I don't knowHugh Jackman was good in the leading roll, and I thought that the supporting cast was good as well. If there were any complaints about the acting I'd have to say that I thought that the actor who played Dracula was a bit lacking as he just didn't seem right for the part. But other than that I thought the movie was great and very entertaining. Movies like this are popcorn movies and while it was a fairly serious movie, it had enough comedy and light heartedness to make it fun. Maybe that was its major downfall was that it didn't take itself serious enough to be this epic movie that it sought out to be. Also I went in with pretty low expectations given all the negative feedback, so maybe that helped my opinion a bit, but all in all I thought it was very entertaining. Also, the DVD has some extra goodies so if you liked it check out the bonus stuff as well.7 / 10 for me. My all time favorite vampire movie is still Bram Stoker's Dracula holding strong as #1, with Interview with a Vampire as #2 for its unique story. Van Helsing would probably be tied with Blade for #3. The Lost boys & Near Dark are also good Vampire movies, but a bit aged by today's standards.",Null,0,1,31 October 2004
Collateral," Wow was I impressed! Nice action thriller
","I read no reviews and only knew the basic premise of this movie before watching it. But I have to tell you this thing rocked! The more I watched the more I was glued to my seat. I missed it in the theaters and rented it the first night it came out. And I was blown away 10 out of 10 for me, and I rarely give movies a 10.I like Action thrillers anyway, so this was right up my ally. It was directed by the same guy who made Heat, another one I loved, though this movie more reminded me of Training day, in terms of the dark flow of the movie, as well as other elements. It started a bit slower with some character development, kind of easing you into things, then once things start rocking, they just get better and better heading towards a huge climax. Very good flow / pacing, good dialog, acting and character development as well. Very impressive movie overall! Cruise is awesome in his role as the stone cold killer with a list of people to whack. Foxx plays the cab driving underachiever with big dreams but lacks the conviction to make them happen. Both did an excellent job. Jada & Mark play supporting roles and give a good performance as well. The script, dialog, situations and acting are top notch. The action scenes seem very realistic, no special effects needed in this movie as the realism of the situation was effect enough. The story, is simple (a little Hollywood-ish) but good and is brought to life by the acting, the script, and of course the directing I'd definitely watch this movie again and would recommend it to anyone who likes action, suspense, drama, thriller movies. It's not for the faint of heart though as its dark heart pounding and involves quite a few murders. Definitely not for young children",10,6,11,15 December 2004
Avengers: Endgame," It doesn't get any better than this
","To say this movie was awesome is an understatement. I'm still processing everything but OMG was it truly a masterpiece. I'm struggling to think if I've ever given a 10 before, but if I have it's only ever been one or two in my life.
This certainly was a 10... However you definitely need to see ALL the movies from 2008's Iron Man through Infinity war. And I do mean ALL of them for this movie to truly shine or even to make sense. Even given the 3 hour running time this movie makes no attempts to fill you in, and nor should it. You need to be well prepared going into thisThat said I saw the opening night fan event showing, and got a commemorative coin that is actually metal, heavy, and super cool! But it was shown in a regular theater with mediocre sound, so I also have tickets for a showing on Friday as well in a Dolby theater room, which I can't wait to see. Now I loved Avengers Infinity War, but I laughed, cheered and got way more emotional in this movie than that one. I've been in theaters where the crowd cheered or laughed before, but I don't think I've ever seen it let alone experienced it to this degree. The emotions were just flowing to say the least.I really liked how the first act brought you into the aftermath of this post-snap world, and really focused on the hardship of what things would have been like after such an event. And while this was all very sad the one thing I was shocked about was that they successfully pulled off so much humor. Humor in a marvel movie is no surprise, but given how Infinity War ended I really thought this was going to be a dark and dreary movie, and yet it gave me some of the best laughs while still taking itself serious. It's quite a magic act to pull offThe second act really sets the game plan in motion for how they plan to 'fix' things and while suspenseful and intriguing it still kept up great and appropriate humor. Obviously humor is a subjective thing and some might bash it. I tend not to like potty humor style but more organic or situational humor, which I thought they just nailed. But at the same time there were some heartache moments that just brought you on the edge of your seat, or made you wipe your eyes. Towards the middle of the movie I was just glued to my seatAnd then there's the third act. OMG... As you would expect it sets up a mega finish as they really are wrapping up the culmination of 11 years and 20+ films worth of story lines and this is what it's all about. The action was great, effects second to none, a bit chaotic at times but that just adds to the intensity. There were moments I just yelled and cheered like I never have at a movie before. I watched it with my daughter who I've taken to or seen every one of the marvel movies with and we were clenching each other through the last 15-20 minutes as it was just so intense, amazing and emotional.Coming out of the movie we were both just stunned and in awe, just trying to process the emotions of what we just saw. To bring out so much emotion in us, and from what we saw so many others is just unbelievable. That in itself just tells you how extraordinary this movie was and is a true credit to everyone involved in making this film. All I can say is don't read any spoilers as there are sure to be some now that it's out. Get some tickets, go and see it for yourself, you will not regret it, but again if you've missed any of the movies in between Iron Man and Infinity war, get caught up first.",10,8,13,26 April 2019
The Butterfly Effect," See the directors cut, absolutely worth the watch!!!
","10 out of 10 for me!!!  I am very glad I read the reviews posted by reviewers (thanks a bunch people!).  I didn't see this movie in the theater, though I was intrigued too.  After reading many reviews saying to watch the directors cut, I rented it and watched that version first.  Wow was I blown away  I'm glad that I never saw it in the theater and instead saw the directors cut first.  I actually was very teary eyed at the end as it made such an impact (and that never happens to me).  Every now and then a movie comes along that makes such a profound impact that it takes a part of you with it, or changes you in some way.  This was one of those movies for me. And I can count on one hand the movies that have done that to me  I can't give an unbiased opinion on this, but had I seen the theatrical version first, I probably would have given it an 8 out of 10 instead.As with many movies, once they hit DVD, there is often additional scenes or a directors edition, and many times they are subtle additions or changes, not with this movie, mark my words.  That is why it's important to watch the directors cut first.  All this being said, I can see why they released the theatrical version instead as the directors cuts wasn't very Hollywood like. It would have been a risk to release the directors cut as the original theatrical version, but I think it would have done better (again my opinion).  So just know the directors edition is more or less a different ending with one or two additional scenes in the middle to support it.  But wow how 5-10 minutes of change can make a difference.I certainly don't want to give much away in this review and for your sake don't read too many reviews or your bound to find one that will spoil it for you, and this is one of those movies that you don't want spoiled if you haven't seen it.  So that being said I won't give any spoilers away.  I thought the acting was well done by all the actors.  The story line is intriguing and kind of Sci-Fi, but is one that you kind of have to accept the time travel thing up front, otherwise you simply can't get into the story.  The effects were good, though they weren't a big aspect in my opinion, meaning I don't think the movie depended on them like so many others to succeed.  Often times with time travel movies, you always have guys going ape over things and pointing out loopholes.  Admittedly they bug me too when they are obvious.  With this movie, it was either so carefully thought out or too much for my brain to handle, but in essence I didn't see any major plot holes.  I thought the flow of the movie was excellent as it reels you in the more you go along, so much so that you don't even want to pause it to hit the bathroom.  If you like suspense, Sci-Fi's, drama's, `What if' kind of movies then see this movie (Directors cut first) and make up your own opinion.  Then watch the theatrical version after.  As said in another review, this movie is very involved and interwoven in that if you miss anything, get up to do something or tune out for a bit, you will loose your place and will get confused.  So no getting up for pop corn, no bathroom breaks and no other outside interruptions without pausing it first, very important.  In fact I would wait until you know you will have 2 hours to yourself before watching.  Good nighttime movie.  It also has good replay value too as you will understand things from a different perspective the next time around.  I wouldn't recommended this movie to those who have been abused in there early childhood, or at least if you have, be ware.  It can be a bit much at points as there are some sensitive scenes and I don't recommend to children at all. But the best movies IMO are the ones that chew you up and spit you out, and this one certainly does that.",10,0,1,14 July 2004
Alien vs. Predator," Awesome movie! Worth the wait
","I loved this movie! I just got out from the midnight showing on the 12th and i have to say that this thing was awesome! I've heard a lot of bad hype stirring before the movie was released, but I'm hear to tell you it was great! I got everything I was hoping for. Looking back I can see how they could get away with it being PG13 and still not rob you of anything. Quite simply it isn't as bad to show aliens / predators getting stabbed, cut, etc and green / acid blood vs humans. In other words the things that happen in the movie, had they happen to a person, would make it R rating. They were very smart about filming the people dying as to avoid the R rating. So believe me there's some decent gore. A director's cut might also be good, but there was certainly nothing lacking in this movie from that standpoint.The movie flow was great, kind of built up until things started to explode. Also, certainly gives you a new found respect for the aliens, the predators too, but you could really see the strategic intelligence of the aliens as they are obviously natural born hunters too. Watch out for that tail! The acting was good enough and I wasn't displeased with the performances of any of the actors, alien or human. I did like the story line and how the sequence of events that led up to a bad situation for the humans and the predators, giving a starting advantage to the aliens. I'd love to talk about specifics, but I don't want to give anything away. The running time was somewhere around 100+ minutes. Also, I loved the very end.I'm happy to report there was very little CGI or at least noticeable CGI in the movie at all. The aliens and the predators looked very real / believable and moved very well too. Hats off to the creature creators and special effects folks. The fight sequences were great too. What I liked best is that unlike movies involving Human fight scenes where its show off time, the aliens / predators don't mess around and simply go for the kill. The fight scenes are pretty quick, but awesome!Only complaints I have (and they're only few minor ones). It took 20-30 minutes to build up and it could have been little longer overall, but in saying that the movie delivered enough. If anything it left you with that feeling of wanting more, which is usually a sign of a good movie, and in this case it is too. They didn't explain how the predators or aliens could keep warm in the cold as they kind of bypass the whole temperature concept for both the aliens / predators, no biggie. I'm still at a loss as to how Bishop fits in and the whole timeline concept connecting the various Bishops, or if it's the same guy, great great grandfather, who knows. Didn't matter too much and the movie could have survived with out him as he wasn't really a key player, just a familiar face. The sound effects were great, but there was no real theme song or lack of a good one. So there's no tune or song you can hum that would remind you of the movie. Again these are very weak complaints.Overall I give this a 9.5 out of 10. There's very little I could think of to improve it to a 10, but the complaints are listed above. I'm glad I saw it opening night and will likely see it again in the theaters. Definitely one I'm going to buy when it hits DVD.",10,9,13,13 August 2004
No Country for Old Men," Frustrating movie...
","This movie started off good and I was intrigued from the beginning, but then 2/3 into the movie it just does a 180 and was a total let down up to the end. Maybe I went into this expecting too much given the high rating & all, it's not like I need a happy or Hollywood ending to like a movie, but this movie was just ruined in the final act, to the point where I was kind of shell shocked, and after that wore off I was kind of pissed knowing I blew 2 hours on this. The best analogy I can give is working on a good jigsaw puzzle only to find there are missing pieces in the end, leaving you feeling cheated.Acting wise I thought Javier and Josh were great and I liked them both. Tommy & Woody were both wasted and didn't serve any point or advance the plot of the movie at all. In fact both of them could have been stripped out of the movie completely and it wouldn't have changed a single thing. Kelly was okay, but nothing specialPersonally I though the effects were kind of hokey, and very noticeable GCI when it came to certain gunshot hits and it always reminds me that practical effects always beat out GCI any day of the week, but sadly this is just the way of things I guessOverall I think the movie had a lot of potential, but it's as if they ran out of money or just tried to pull off some weird M. Night Shyamalan ending which failed miserably. It's really hard to digest and describe without directly spoiling, but in the end I was left unsatisfied and a bit confused, and not confused as in I didn't get it, but again I really can't dive into that more without giving away spoilers. If anything it teaches me to never simply go off a rating...",2,3,5,3 August 2019
Drive," I must have missed the boat, sorry 'car' on this
","On the one hand I can try to admire the semi originality of the look, feel and interaction between the actors during scenes, but sadly at best it just simply reminded me of many foreign films I've seen. Some of which have been good and yet while this film did have so many foreign aspects including lead characters not to mention the director I can't help but lump it in to that category even though it supposedly took place in LA (yet no LA like I ever knew and lived in for many years). Yet this film also borders on the artsy / indie aspect as well. So in that aspect you'll either probably really like or just not get this film.In the end for me it didn't work. Yeah I like the whole idea of this James Dean lead character who played it cool through everything, but it just doesn't come off as realistic, least to me. The social scenes just seemed awkward and I couldn't help but think if any person or woman met this guy in real life would immediately think 'what a freak...' I mean seriously when you ask somebody something and they just stare at you back you're either thinking mentally impaired or just plain stupid. So while the movie tries to ride this wave and maybe for others it worked, but for me it for the most part went over like a bad 'B' 80's horror flick.That said, the character did start to grow on me after a while and there were a couple decent action and driving scenes, and a part of me can somewhat appreciate this whole artistic approach taken which is the only reason I gave it a 4/10 and I'm struggling at that and really thought the end just sucked and was so underdone. I certainly wouldn't give it a second watch and am pretty amazed at it getting nearly an 8/10 score here and maybe that was my mistake going in was the high expectation. Oh well to each their own and I guess in this one I'm the minority who just didn't get it",5,9,16,19 August 2012
The Secret Life of Walter Mitty," Maybe I'm too shallow...
","But I got so bored in t his movie and lost utter interest not even half way through.I remembered when this movie came out and I was a bit tempted to see it in the theater, so glad I didn't as there really is nothing big picture worthy of it other than a few landscaping scenes that are easily forgettable. However the previews intrigued me and I've always been a Ben Stiller fan.So anyway I finally watched this and I loved the first 15+ minutes of it which is totally what I had expected, but something unexpected happened when he finally took that big leap into 'action.' And that is it got totally boring. Like painfully boring...I'll admit I'm more of an action guy at heart, but I enjoy a good comedy / drama and though this would fit the bill and given it's solid rating I was totally let down by just how boring it was the last 2/3 of the movie. I mean here this daydreamer finally takes the plunge, but it so unbelievable when it finally happens I can't tell whether he's still in dreamland or not, but honestly it doesn't matter as by half way in I've already so lost interest in his quest, the picture, his interest in the girl, his job. It seemed to just be taking a depressing turn and by 2/3 the way in I just totally tuned out, got up, made a snack and tuned in here and there. I saw the ending, was just as unimpressed and afterwards thought to myself 'Wow... That was such a waist of time!'I guess I'm in the minority here as the picture got decent reviews, I guess it just missed my boat. If there was a higher message (and I got they were shooting for something there) I was just so not on board and unimpressed that on my scale it just fell flat as a pancake. Giving it a 1/10 as I've sat through some bad movies but couldn't sit all the way through this...",1,4,12,27 July 2014
The Game," Great idea & acting, way too unbelievable, even for a movie
","Somehow I missed this years ago and it popped up on Netflix and like most other NF movies I tend to check IMDB reviews as a lot are duds, however this moving getting such a high review rating I had to check it out. It starts off great and has a good suspenseful feel. Sadly though around the midpoint it just gets way to unbelievable. I get that the writers / director wants to keep you guessing if this is just a game, if it's real, who's in on it, etc... and that does keep it exciting and as far as entertainment the movie does deliver, but being so unbelievable it more or less bounced me out of the movie. Plus I thought the end was cheap and way to full of holes** Spoilers ahead ** As mentioned before, I liked how it started out, was intriguing, you definitely get the feel that the lengthy interview process and all the details within would be used against him later on, and they certainly are. It was enjoyable as he started to become paranoid about who was in on it, what was going on, etc... But then right about the point where his house is completely trashed I told myself, either it's for real and he's being discredited and on the chopping block, but that didn't add up. Or it was just a game, but that was just unbelievable, either way I was bounced out of the movie.From there things just get more and more ridiculous and you realize the scale of which this is operating. We're talking potentially hundreds of people involved on this game / con depending on what you're believe at the time. In the end after the big reveal (or not) you start to mentally go back and think about things and realize just how ridiculous and unbelievable it all was, even for a movie. The amount of expense to even pull something like this off would have to be a few hundred thousand dollars, given materials, people, destruction, etc... And his brother sure didn't look to me like he could have covered the bill unless he had some big inheritance he was sitting onI realize it's just a movie and it was entertaining but if at the end everything comes unraveled then you come away with the feeling that you were cheated, which is how I felt. Nobody has a crystal ball and can tell exactly what a person would do, regardless if you had all the upfront info they had. Nobody could do that amount of preparation either to account for what he might have done. Then there's the other aspect that nobody was seriously hurt or killed, which is very unrealistic given all that happened. The fact that he didn't get seriously hurt, or killed, or hurt or killed anyone else for that matter. And I don't buy that the phycological screening made it so they could play him like a pawn, nobody is that predictable, especially all the elements you can't control. It's in these aspects the movie unravels itself and falls apart.Now what could have made this great, albeit maybe not as action packed, is if it wasn't so over the top with the near deaths, or if it wasn't so picture perfect. He knew he was being played all along regardless if it was a game or the stakes real, but if he would have outsmarted them at points, caught them off their guard, or hit dead ends it would have made for a much more realistic aspect and made it much more believable in the end. And especially the end, you can't predict where someone is going to jump off a building to their perceived death. That definitely shouldn't have played out that way. All in all a great idea and could have been pulled off much better. I really don't understand the high rating given all the holes and how unrealistic it was, but I guess you can't please everyone...",4,1,4,28 August 2018
X-Men: Apocalypse," Way over the top & tons of holes & contradictions
","I usually love marvel movies and have liked pretty much all the X- men franchise to date, but this movie was just retarded. It's great that special effects wise we can do pretty much anything nowadays, but this movie took that idea and just went too much with it to the point where everything was ridiculous.I'm certainly glad I didn't pay to see this. I guess every movie mo matter how good or bad rubs some people the wrong way and I guess that was this for me. I just felt that everything power and destruction wise was just too much to the point where I was no longer enjoying a movie but rather being reminded that I was seeing one.Part of the thing I hate about evolution especially when it comes to movies is just how they feel they need to one up everything, but what those retards don't realize is that at a certain point it just all looks fake and stupid, and that's pretty much how this movie ended up for me.Far as time lines, it seems to me they broke so many aspects of peoples encounters and other such that it just seems ridiculous. Wasn't it just a couple movies back that Kurt was introduced and Jean and Storm found him, and didn't know of him? Yet they were in this movie all together? So many stupid things like that plus the over the top powers just made this an utter mess...",2,6,17,5 June 2016
Coco," Where the heck did this come from?
","I have no idea how this gem snuck past us when in the theaters, and too bad as it really has some of the best visuals of any animated film. It wasn't until we took a 2400 mile family road-trip in the summer of 2018 that we discovered it. My daughter stumbled onto it during the car ride, went nuts after seeing it, wouldn't stop raving about it, and literally watched it another 4 times pretty much back to back!When we finally got back we all watched it together and I have to admit I was blown away, my wife too! Lets face it, Disney / Pixar usually puts out decent movies, many are forgettable, but there are a handful that really stick with you and Coco makes that list. It doesn't matter what nationality you are, but I can see how it's really a home run for the Latino communityFirst off, great story! I'm not Latino, and growing up just assumed Halloween was your typical worldly holiday, which to me simply meant dressing up in costumes and getting free candy. I had no idea the significance or meaning it had for Mexico & Latin America countries and it took a Disney movie to educate this 40+ year old about this. But I'm certainly glad it did. But getting back to the story, it was original, fun, and with some good twists & turns.The Acting and songs were great, but the visuals were probably the best I can think of to date. I remember when I first saw Finding Nemo how stunned I was by the colors and visuals, but Coco takes that to a whole other level. I applaud the makers of this movies for keeping it original (based on what I've read in other reviews) and keeping with a Latino castOnly bad thing about this movie is now Disney / Pixar really has it's work cut out for them, trying to outdo this...",10,2,4,4 November 2018
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Kung Fu - Tarantino Style
","This might be my new favorite Tarantino movie with Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs being my previous favorites.  I've always liked kung fu movies and Tarantino's directing / movie making style, so when I knew he was coming out with his own kung fu flick, I just said `Tarantino, don't let me down.'  Well he most certainly didn't let me down!This film rocks!  It's very inline with his directing cinematography style you've come to expect from Tarantino, a movie made up of short stories or segments that are somewhat out of sync in terms of a timeline.  Kill Bill isn't nearly as bad as pulp fiction as far as jumping around.  The only complaint I have is that you pretty much know who's gonna win in the end because it's given away early in the film.  It's another Tarantino trait which does take some of the suspense out near the end, but it's certainly made up for with the over the top blood spewing and genuine action of the fight scenes.The story is all about a woman (Uma Thurman) who is nearly killed by the Viper Assassination Squad for reasons which I either missed or they didn't explain.  Anyway she after a 4 year comma comes back to avenge the 5 people who tried to kill her.  The first movie (there's a part two coming out next year) is about the first two people on the list.The martial arts in this movie is great.  Very little CGI if any which I'm glad of cause it just ruins a movie in my opinion.  There is some `Crouching tiger hidden dragon' wire jumping, but not enough to annoy you (thank god). But probably the most notable thing about the fight scenes is the blood spewing from chopped off limbs, ect.  It's hilariously over the top, but magically doesn't detract from the excitement and seriousness of the fight scenes itself.  I'll bet they used 100+ gallons of fake blood in the movie. I sure hope Uma Thurman got paid overtime for this as she definitely earned it.Cinematography is second to none as Tarantino makes use of normal, black and white, cartoon, and even a black light simulated scenes.  His use of music is similar to what he's done in the past with his 70's style that strangely enough seem to fit every moment of the film.  His thoughtfulness and attention to detail amazes me.  I hope when he passes on he donates his brain to science as he's the Rembrandt of movie making.In closing, I'd say definitely see this movie if you either like marital arts, Tarantino, or woman power.  And for those of you who think he might ruin the seriousness of true Kung fu movies won't be disappointed as he doesn't (in my opinion) dishonor the spirit of them.  Only reason I can think of for not seeing it is if you are really squeamish about blood. Can't wait for part II!",Null,0,0,17 October 2003
Logan," Didn't WOW me, left the movie kind of empty
","Obviously Jackman & Stewart and other supporting cast were really good and the acting is great. Effects are good and being the movie is rated R, there is definitely a lot of graphic battles & violence, as well as a number of F-bombs, some of which were funny. So overall I'm glad I went to see the movie, but there were definitely things I would have changed and / or didn't like. Given it has such a high rating here on IMDb maybe I went in with too high of expectations.Length, this movie clocks in at almost 2 1/2 hours, and it feels every bit that long. I saw it with a friend and granted we saw a 10:20 pm showing, but I think he actually dozed off towards the end, lol... There are just a number of scenes that could have been shortened and overall this could have easily been under 2 hours and still captured everything it set out to.So many unanswered questions, where to begin? Now I'm not a critic of loose ends or movies not explaining things, it kind of adds to the suspense and mystery, and if anything gives people something to debate about and can one day possibly be further explained in a squeal. So unanswered questions I'm not against. But this movie just had too many to the point where when it finished I was kind of left asking, wth did I just watch? Did Xavier kill all the other mutants when he seizured out? Did none survive other than them 3? What about all the other mutants in the world? Are they dying off for some reason? Why are Xavier and Logan in hiding or on the run in the first place? Who is Mr Whitey, what's his purpose other than frying in the sun? Then there's the big overall question of why Logan's healing ability is shutting down? We saw in the last movie he had some critter around his heart which temporarily nullified his healing ability, but once he ripped that sucker off he was fine again. It was hinted it might be adamantium poisoning, but after being in his body for 70 years it just now starts poisoning him? Doesn't he care that he's not healing & getting sicker? Is he just fed up with life? How did they manage to clone him into that X-24 younger Logan? I could go on and on and while I certainly don't mind a few unanswered questions, it seems like that's all this movie did was bombard you with a lot of mysteries and unanswered questions.Finally the ending, so as mentioned 'spoiler alerts' and while this movie had a deteriorating feeling from start to finish, you kind of knew it was going to end badly end basically every mutant we ever knew and cared about is now gone, except for this new group of kids, who I don't really care about. So maybe it's time to finally bury the hatchet, and we certainly have other Marvel characters and story lines in the hopper.So whether Marvel tried to one up the Superman vs. Batman ending by killing off not only the star, but pretty much everyone (I actually half expected Jackman's spiked hand to punch through the rocks at the end), or whether they just figured it was time for this story line to end, which is okay... Overall I did like the acting and action, conversely it did run on in parts and I certainly got bored a few times. But to close out a entire MC line while presenting so many unanswered questions was the real kicker and kind of left me with an empty feeling rather than 'That movie kicked ass!

","It would be strong to say that I hated the movie, and maybe my expectations were too high going into it, but other than the story being a pretty original idea, I didn't really like it and wasn't entertained much at all. I hadn't seen this in the theater and as soon as it came out on DVD I checked IMDB for ratings & reviews.  When I saw that it had got 8 out of 10 rating, plus it was a father son / fantasy movie, I raced over to blockbuster to rent it thinking for sure I would have liked it.  Sadly enough and to my surprise, it did nothing for me.  I did watch it pretty late in the day and found myself yawning and wondering when it would pick up, but in my opinion any good movie would keep me awake no matter what time I watch it.As I said, it had a pretty original story, and the acting was certainly believable.  For me though I had a hard time just simply enjoying the fantasy and imagination of the stories and how they unfolded when instead I focused on the credibility of them and the damage it was causing to his son. Don't get me wrong I am a movie freak and my favorite movies are action, Sci-Fi, fantasy, and horror, so I depend heavily on the make believe.  I like a good drama too, but in this movie, I think too because I am a father, I sided more with the son in that, I just saw him as a terrible father, possibly terrible husband too.  I kept thinking to myself, now here's a guy who apparently wasn't satisfied with his normal life so he creates this second life, most of which is fantasy, but you don't really know which is fact and fiction.  But because he was a good story teller and such a social person, the stories were enjoyed by most rather than just passed off as a pathological liar.  I might have been able to get in the spirit of that, but his son resented him for it and I guess so did I.  I think too it struck to close to home for me as it reminded me partly of my own father in that I can't ask the guy what time it is without him telling me how to build a clock.  Or if I try to tell him about something, he'll interrupt me and go off on some tangent story himself.  Another pet peeve of mine is that it pains me to see parents mistreat there kids or tell them lies and from one perspective that's all this movie is about.  In one scene the son told his father that he didn't know anything about the real him because all he got were these fantasy stories rather than stories of how his father really was. And because he too was going to become a father he wanted his son to know the real him.  In this scene I cried out `Amen!'  But in the end (which was pretty un-climactic), because his father was dying and more or less to make piece with him, the son reluctantly told him a story of how he dies, or moves on I should say.I guess another issue that bothered me was that the father was always seen as a man who was a good person and who helped others out because he was such a good person.  And here he ended up buying up a whole town (which appeared to be a true story) in order to preserve it.  But again rather than admiring him for that I kept thinking, that his son and wife never saw him because he was too busy working and keeping up this other life.  It's kind of like feeding others when your own family starves, and I guess that's the feeling that I came away with on this movie.  It shocks me quite frankly that it received 8 out of 10 as very few movies hit that mark.  I have thought that Tim Burton's past movies have been really good, this one just didn't sit too well with me.  But as it stands now, it's in the top 250 movies of all time (shocking), so it must be worth a watch.  Hope you like it and get more out of it than I did.",Null,2,3,30 April 2004
The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 2," Very good conclusion!
","Honestly I hesitate to vote as 'love stories' are really not my gig, although I love the whole vampire ensemble and most everything that goes along with it which I guess includes this too. The fact that this movie had a good final battle made all the difference at least for me, be it a vision or not. That and the fact that it truly wrapped up the entire thing with no lame cliff hanger ending.I took my now 11 year old daughter to this, keep in mind I took her reluctantly to the original Twilight back when she was 7 when everyone in her class was raving about it. I had a hard time in the 3rd movie when well you know what happens... In any case I have to say this 4th movie was very good and probably 2nd to only the first movie as it's next to impossible to top the first movie of anything. It really brought everything together, tied together everything story line wise and really gave everyone what they wanted, which really was to see Bella finally become a vampire and embrace that lifestyle.The whole Volturi 'bad guy' thing played out well in the end and left a satisfying ending at least to me. typically I hate that whole 'It was all a dream' kind of ending, but in this movie it seem to fit and yet not rob you of the experience. I have to say Kristen Stewart is really a beautiful girl and it was nice to see her made up so beautiful in this movie and see her smile and actually look happy as she's been so subdued and withdrawn beauty wise in the previous movies. It's no doubt she was born to stardom and we'll be seeing more of her.",8,3,8,2 December 2012
In Time," Quite astonished this film got the rating it did...
","I'd love to write a novel here, but my time is more precious than that (no pun intended via the movie itself). Honestly though the idea of a world where currency is in the form of hours / days / months / years in terms of ones longevity just seem utterly retarded.Okay I get that there's this evolutionary leap where humans stop aging at age 25 and thus are given internal time bands to terminate their life when the counter reaches zero, and there's this whole other concept of stealing / borrowing time from others and so forth and the whole while from start to finish I was just dumbstruck by this concept that some idiot producer would actually say 'hey this is original and revolutionary.'I did like the performances of the characters and such and as far as a run & hide movie it did well, however this dumb-ass concept of time and lifelines I just could not come to grips with and just thought it was a horrible idea from start to finish. I'm glad I watched the movie for free and had I paid $10 to see it I would have thought a year or so of my life had been stolen from me. In the end this will be a very forgettable flick, which under a different concept maybe could have been something, but was just an utter train wreck.So yeah I lost 2 hours to this flick and that is non disputable, though luckily for me time is on my side and I will forget about it in time...",2,0,1,19 July 2012
War of the Worlds," Worth the money!
","Possible spoilers ahead Feels good when you go to the movies and you come out feeling like you got your money's worth. I enjoyed this movie and like others pointed out, really liked the cinematography and styling that Spielberg used for the effects / action scenes. I vaguely remembered the original 50's version and recall some similarities but this movie seemed quite different too. While I recall the 50's flick aliens ships had shields too, they were flying saucers with sparklers for the main gun rather than the tripods in this movie. Also I don't remember them abducting anyone and were bent solely on destruction. Never read the book, so I don't know which is a closer adaptation. Obviously the reason for their destruction remains the same, which is why it surprised me that other posters said that it ends abruptly, which is how I remembered the original one ending too. So I was not surprised at all by this, little confused as to why others were though.I have to say the entry sound the Tripods made was pretty damn scary, and is an important part of the fear factor for this movie, that being said, see it in a movie theater with good sound, otherwise this important and scary aspect is lost. I thought the acting was good and both cruise and his daughter put on good performances and made it believable. The son kind of bugged me, but not to the point of affecting my opinion of the movie itself.While I vaguely remembered the basement scene in the original movie where they chopped off the head of the robot camera and studied it, I didn't remember Tim Robins character and him needing to be killed as it happened in this movie. It was the only scene that kind of bugged me a little bit, well that and why that guys video camera worked. Speaking of which I couldn't tell what part that guy had fixed on the car to make it run again, but I'm guessing that only the transportation lightning affected the power of things and not the actual robots roasting everyone.I guess the one other concept that bugged me was the theory that the robots were always there and the aliens simply beamed down there and then broke through the surface to start attacking everyone. It raises some interesting questions like why didn't we ever discover any of these tripods before the aliens beamed down in them? And if they had been down there for thousands of years and all, why didn't the aliens take over the planet back then? Why bury thousands of robot machines all over the world only to take it over hundreds of years later? Doesn't make sense to me unless I just missed something.On a larger scale, I didn't make sense to me why you would have these walking Tripods reeking havoc all over when you could more effectively and efficiently kill off people with some sort of harmful ray gun like in Independence Day or some sort of biological weapon or something. Granted the movie was much more entertaining and action packed the way it was done. I guess while watching it it just occurred to me that these things are grounded with there 3 long legs, don't appear to move that fast (meaning you could out drive / out run them) and were killing people individually with the lighting guns that tuned people into popcorn dust. It would take quite a long time to exterminate city's that way. Kind of like trying to kill every bug in the house by spraying each one when you could bug bomb the whole place. I do realize that the book was written back in the 30's and all, but still just doesn't seem very realistic I guess.Anyways getting little off topic. I did think the movie kept you glued to your seat throughout and kept me entertained the whole time",8,3,12,29 June 2005
Joker," Definitely not a 'feel good' movie
","I didn't see any previews or read any reviews, went into this completely blind other than knowing it was somewhat of an origin story about the Joker. Overall I thought the movie was really well done, but I realized that this isn't really my kind of movie, maybe I'm more of a Marvel type person...The depiction of this was a very, very realistic rendition about how the 'Joker' might have come to beg. And in that regard it's a little bit scary. There's no glamour, no movie magic, gimmicks, or special effects, this is very much as realistic of an approach I've ever seen to a comic book like character. The only thing that comes close IMO are the M. Night Shyamalan movies 'Unbreakable', 'Split', and 'Glass' which I very much enjoyed, but even those involve abilities and some suspension of disbelief, but if you liked this kind of movie then those movies are in the same category of realism, or at least a setting of realism.As for the actor, Phoenix did a remarkable job, he's certainly not one of my favorite actors by any means and I've only seen him in a couple movies, where incidentally he played the bad guy, but I have to give him credit as he did a wonderful job playing the abused, dark, and disturbed Arthur. Far as rooting for the bad guy, this movie certainly sets you up to feel for Arthur from the very beginning. He's a guy who's basically been dealt a bad hand from the beginning, and if anything really shows the mental instability of his character, and to a large degree how he's a product of the environment he was brought up in. In that unique sense, and from a certain perspective, pretty much everything he does is justified. I'm certainly not saying I agree with any of it, but you can plainly see why he does the things he does and is certainly a cause and effect situation.I came out of the movie saying 'Wow...' and started to stir on it for hours afterwards. I very much like action, horror, sci-fi & drama. So this is every bit up my spectrum of movies that I enjoy. But I certainly didn't come out of the movie feeling good or energized by any means. My biggest criteria and measuring stick for a movie is simply 'entertainment.' Was I entertained? Very much so... Did I enjoy it? Not really, and this for me is a rarity but there are a few movies I've seen over the years that fit into that exact category.So... to sum up. It is a masterpiece in what it's trying to do, and is very entertaining, so I give it a 10 in that regard. But I honestly didn't really like it that much either, it's very dark, disturbing, and pretty much a downer from start to finish and you leave feeling drained and empty. In that regard I give it a 2. Thus my final score of a 6 is what I rate it. I realize IMDB currently has this pegged as an 8.9, which is ridiculously high, and I can to some degree understand why in that it's very unique. I guess in the end what I learned about myself is I like dark movies if they either aren't serious, or realistic. But for me a large reason of why I enjoy movies is to get away from the real world, so I can see why in this instance because its dark, and because it was realistic, why I didn't really like it...",6,3,8,19 October 2019
Prometheus," What a waste of time
","So honestly I was so anticipating this movie that I had broken the cardinal rule and looked at ratings and even skimmed the first couple pages of reviews on here and the interesting thing is most times the figures and the reviews coincide. However this time that certainly wasn't the case and I can tell you honestly that did not alter my review or even skew it in any way. I have no idea how this movie got such a high score but it isn't true by any meansThis movie was overall boring and very predictable... I went there opening day along with a work morale event. Now if I'd paid for my ticket I would have been even more disappointment. As it was I was overall very unsatisfied and expected much more from Ridley Scott. Hell even Legend which was much more of a bomb than this had so much more to offer. There was absolutely no suspense at all but more importantly as a Sci-Fi (and I'm a total Sci-Fi guy) from the start I was never reeled in at all, not once as it was just so flat. I felt like I was in a seat at a theater bored out of my skull and at one point I looked down at my phone to discover I was an hour into the movie and debated about walking out as it was that boring. However I stuck it out because I had nothing better to do than go back to work (tough choice huh). So I stuck it out and the second half wasn't any more suspenseful or action packed than the first half and I really felt let down on this flick as I was so looking forward to it. Talk about missing the mark.. Great job Ridley, you flubbed t his one up big time...The suspense or tension was obsolete. The acting was nothing memorable other than the captain of the ship whom I don't even know who he was. the two main big stars (Charlize Theron and Michael Fassbender) were flatter than flat although Michael was decent I suppose for his android role he was given, but seriously they could have given away Charlize's role to some other lesser paid actor as her role was so wooden and stone cold that there was really no dimension or acting ability there.So other reviews had mentioned the spectacular effects and IMHO I didn't think they were at all that notable at all, which was the films other saving grace. nothing from the ship, the planet, the atmosphere, the tunnels, nothing at all left me going 'ahhhh...' So in the end this movie IMHO fell flat on it's face. The co-workers that I went with gave it a little more than I but not much. This is by no means a gem and should a sequel be done it should not be directed by Ridley who as far as I'm concerned was a well respected director who apparently doesn't have the juice anymore. And such a disappointment being he directed the first Alien movie...",1,30,97,8 June 2012
Wonder Woman," It's interesting, how...
","When the movie first came out, reviews on IMDb raved about it. I mean they were all positive. Then I looked again today after seeing it for the first time and saw more negative reviews than positive. So it's interesting...How am I to rate this? People will hate this analogy but It's very similar to the first Captain America movie. Similar time frame, similar story-line, bad guys, etc. I half expected them to bump into each other somewhere in the movie, lol...Gal is very pretty, and that never hurts, but overall I found the entire plot a little flat. The 'bad guy' & end fight, while it had a couple moments wasn't anything to be remembered. Heck Batman vs. Superman had a much more exciting end fight sequence than this. But I suppose this being the origin movie, you can't have the pony outrace the horse I guess.In the end, I'm glad I didn't pay to see it, and if I had after reading the overwhelmingly positive reviews I probably would have left disappointed. It's not a bad movie, but just nothing that really wow'ed me. But that was similar to the first Cap movie like I mentioned before. It kind of set the stage I guess you could say and gave her the backstory which is what they intended",5,4,13,14 June 2017
The Purge," Kind of a sick / demented movie
","Lot of people mention it's an 'original idea' and such, but I didn't find it very original at all. It's pretty much a spin off of Battle Royale & Hunger games.I did like the suspense aspect and the flow of the movie was good. action sequences were decent and Ethan Hawk (who I've always liked) did a decent job here, but that's about the end of my likes.What I didn't like was the very concept of the plot and just thought for a movie that is trying to take itself serious the plot itself just didn't add up or wasn't realistic IMHO. I just couldn't buy the fact that there's now this Utopian America and we owe it all to this 'Purge' day when people can unleash all that bottled up anger and go all rage crazy. I'm sorry if a day like this existed and people really did go around killing, raping, and committing other various crimes are they really all going to be able to just turn it off the next day and go back to their fairy tail lives? No way in hell. If you kill someone just because you can, it's not like it cleanses you and makes you a better person the other 364 days out of the year. That's utterly ridiculous...As others have mentioned the other things that bugged me about the movie was how idiotic their kids were. Their son is a hypochondriac freak who builds a spy machine out of a tank and mutilated baby? Sorry but a kid like that needs to be in some serious therapy or a straight jacket. Not to mention a total idiot who endangers his entire family by disarming the alarm letting some stranger in the house, what an unrealistic character... The daughter is also a moron who won't group huddle with her family in a crisis situation, another unrealistic aspect... The masked gang acted like total retards to the point where it was just stupid, as did the neighbors. I don't know if they were just trying to copy A Clockwork Orange or what. It's like they were all on drugs or in some weird robot mode. I don't know if it was meant to be creepy or what but in the end it just came off as weird, unbelievable and stupid. And finally I hate to say it but Ethan Hawks character was right in that they should have just handed over the guy to the masked gang as there really was no other option other than to fight, in which odds were they would have all been killed. And as others have pointed out the dialog throughout was just weird and not natural or realistic.Overall just too many unrealistic and stupid things for a movie that's trying to come across as a serious movie.",4,1,1,22 April 2014
Life," Idiotic Movie, moreover wth IMDB???
","What I don't get, as I've seen this in quite a few movies is when a movie has a decent or good score (in this case this was over 6), yet if you read reviews they are all consistently 4 and below, so where does this extra 'boost' of positive votes come from? Hollywood??? IMDB pay-overs???I don't mean to blame IMDB, but yet I do in that it should be indifferent, yet I've seen enough of this crap where overwhelmingly the reviews come back super negative yet you see a decent score. I mean how is that supposed to be possible right? Where the F is that positive score coming from???With this movie, it's literally a cliche of dumb moves over and over again. The alien doesn't have to be smart at all as it can just rely upon all humans doing the worst thing they could possibly do, to the benefit of the alien, and in this regard it's really hard to watch as it happens over and over and overI literally could not watch the end, which kills me as I saw 3/4 of the movie but honestly I could care less how this ends, if the alien makes it to earth and kills everyone, then awesome. What a stupid movie... I'm only glad I didn't waste any money on this or I'd be slitting my own throat. This movie gets the lowest vote possible, I don't care if it had recognizable actors or decent effects, it all went out the arse end of the airlock for me...",1,3,6,3 June 2018
Kingsman: The Secret Service," Didn't work for me on any level
","I went into this movie with decent hopes given the high rating it had, but it's not like I was over expecting or anything. In the end I found this thing a total a mess. I think for me it tried to ride too many lines and as a result failed in most aspects. It tried to take itself serious as a spy movie, yet it also tried to be this weird comedy, and while I think movies are capable of doing both, this one just didn't do it well or right to the point where it just bounced me out of the movie completely. Far as it taking itself seriously I found it to be way over the top unbelievable and unrealistic to the point of being stupid. Far as the comedy, I just didn't think the nuclear head explosions or the McDonalds being served on a silver platter was funny at all.Granted I'm American and I get that English humor is a bit different, but I love Monty Python, Snatch, Mr. Bean, even most of the Bond films. Yet most of the funny moments in this movie I just found remarkably unfunny to the point where rather than it being a quick laugh it just completely bounced me out of the movie. And the few comical moments that were actually funny were already covered in the trailers, so for me this movie totally fell flat on the comedy scale to the point of actually hurting the movie.Now on the taking itself seriously aspect, the whole spy gig, the young recruit, it just failed on that level for me as well. Certain aspects of the action scenes were done well and some of the bullet time action was good, but I thought the editing needed a lot of work. The massacre in the church I just thought was way over done and too long. I find it amazing in movies like this how fight scenes go on for many minutes and when it's all done, people are barely winded, breathing normally. Give me a break, go watch professional boxers or MMA fighters and see how they look after just one round, and they are real athletes who train vigorously. So while some of the action was okay, it was so over the top that again it bounced me out of the movie. So between the bad comedy and overcooked action I was constantly being reminded that I was watching a movie rather than be swept up into one.My last beef is with the main kid and the whole 'recruitment / training camp'. Probably what bounced me out of the movie the most was here we have some reckless rebellious kid who's training to this point has been gymnastics, so okay he's flexible, has good balance, etc... Yet with little to no further training at all he's the biggest bad ass? The recruitment / initiation program was a joke. It wasn't a training program of any kind, it was basically 'lets throw these kids in a no win situation and see how the fend and who comes out on top.' I get the idea was they were trying to weed through all the recruits to get the best one, but the whole while I kept thinking 'So this kid is just a natural born bad ass because he did gymnastics and has daddy issues?' Then once he's out and starts real life spy work he's untouchable and better than all the worlds master assassins. It's like her Mom's bf who bullies him early in the movie, who he confronts in the end, and I'm thinking 'So other than being this super spy what has he done to actually improve his skills as a fighter?'Overall I thought the action was decent, but very over the edge of what you'd consider to be believable 'movie believability I mean.' The black comedy was pretty flat and did very little in making me laugh or enjoy myself. Finally the believability of this kid taking over for his dad and his quasi predecessor was just absurd. I give it a 3 / 10. One point on principle and because I liked the main spy girl, a 2nd point because some of the action was decent, and a 3rd point for the best part of the movie which was the bare ass scene at the end, which shocked me enough to yell out 'HELLO!'",3,184,334,26 February 2015
The Twilight Saga: Eclipse," I liked it & my 8 year old loved it
","It's weird how a movie gets a generally low scores as far as it's rating, yet the people who I talk to who have seen it seem to like it. I guess it's one of those cult following movies where the 'masses' just don't get it or like it but there are those who obviously like it, kind of a love / hate type of thing I guess. Overall I think I liked this movie as much if not more than the first one. It's kind of funny too as I read a few preliminary screening reviews where people complained about a slow boring predictable story with bad acting & dodgy special effects. Honestly I liked this movie and thought the flow, story, acting, additional character development & action were all good. So to each their own I guess. My daughter loved it. So there you goFar as younger kids viewing it are concerned, I should point out that I have an eight year old daughter and the fact that I saw the first two movies prior to letting her see them as after all it is a love story, she's only eight and it is rated PG-13... So I took a chance on this one being we went to see it in the theater together and there was definitely more kissing / make out scenes than I anticipated even know I new this one focused more on the love triangle aspect. There was one scene I thought I was going to have to cover up her eyes, but luckily it fizzled out before it got too juicy. Far as the action & gore are concerned, there is really no reason to be concerned here. The few 'feeding' scenes aren't graphic and the climactic battle scenes while intense were not gory in the least being the action is pretty quick not to mention the vampires don't bleed but rather crumble more like statues when killed. I did not and would not bring my 6 year old daughter to see this though Overall I liked the further character development they did on the Cullen family members, this movie focused more on them whereas Bella's classmate friends took more of a sideline in this movie. Again I thought the story flowed and developed well and I was not bored through any of it. It's not the kind of movie where I could watch again and again though and I would typically not pay to go to the theater to see this movie, but my daughter is in love with the series. In the end I'm glad we went and had a good time.",8,4,11,3 July 2010
Sin City," Awesome movie!!!
","I must have dropped off the map for a while as I heard very little of this movie when it was out in theaters, anyway when it came out on DVD I rented it and wow was I surprised. It's totally badass, a guy guy movie to say the least. Great story with tons of Violence, Filled with beautiful woman with some good nude T&A scenes, and a likable cast of professional actors. I will be in the theaters for Sin City 2 for sure.What amazed me most about this movie was the amount of violence they were able to show, I think it goes back to my blood theory, meaning that the more red blood they show, the harder it is for them to get the R rating (meaning to harsh for R). So this movie is filmed similar to Sky Captain in that most of the backgrounds are CGI while the characters are real. However the movie is filmed or converted I should say to mainly black and white, but color is added in certain situations for certain things, just to shake things up. In doing this they accomplished a few things. It kept a sort of 1920's kind of feel to the movie, yet it also made it scarier in a way which was good. Plus the big factor is that they could show a guy getting shot up or beat to hell in very graphic ways, but the blood would be in black in white or some other color than red in certain scenes, IMO this enabled them to get away with showing some graphic scenes and yet keep the R rating.This movie blew me away from start to finish as I was intrigued and glued to my seat the whole time. It goes without saying that this is a hardcore action movie, so for those who don't like action or violence in heavy amounts, take a pass on this one. However for those who thrive off heavy action / gory movies like me, then this will be a treat for you! The movie is very comic book like containing heroes & villains who are all badass in their own way and who can take and dish out quite a bit of punishment. And yet it didn't come out trashy like 90% of all the marvel comic movies that come out. A real tribute to comic book like movies and action / gore movies If you haven't seen it yet and like Action / horror / thriller movies, rent it ASAP as it is awesome",10,0,3,13 September 2005
Warm Bodies," I liked it, nothing like good clean wholesome zombie fun
","So for those who haven't done their homework this is obviously a very different kind of zombie gig, and being how vampires, zombies, not to mention the imminent and ever approaching zombie apocalypse, mustaches, and glow in the dark zebra print duct tape are all in full bloom now, why not a touchy feely zombie flick? I mean really why not???Who knows, maybe we as a people have overcooked the same ham time and time again but I do have to say for what it's worth this film is original in that it's from the perspective of a zombie, and not only that but a zombie with thoughts who changes and causes others to change, and all for love. I mean what a sediment...So anyway, the movie is not one that I'd put in my top 10 list and will probably be forgotten over time as most spoof like movies are for me, but it was put together and flowed rather well. It had a different kind of heartbeat all on it's own (pun intended) and was enjoyable for me to watch. And that really is what it all boils down to is entertainment value right? I don't care if you're watching a movie about aids or a total comedy, if you are entertained and came out of it with something well then isn't that the whole point? This is obviously a lower budget movie with no big stars except for John Malkovich as most zombie like flicks are, but it had a totally different approach as pretty much given away by the trailers and such.In the end I liked it and wanted to see it first before showing my kids to make sure it was worth watching and not too graphic as they are totally into Plants vs. Zombies gig and all the like and would probably love this and I'll show it to them when it comes out on disk. The movie could have done without the one 'F' word scene although for me it made a good laugh, so eh nothing's perfect. It's by no means a summer Marvel blockbuster nor a Steven Spielberg great, but it stands on it's own and I give it a thumbs up.",7,1,3,25 April 2013
Jurassic Park," Still beats every CGI movie out there today...
","I just watched this again in what seems like years  Honestly I have to say it's still great!  It has aged very well considering the dinosaurs still look very real and outdo today's CGI, which is extremely surprising given it's more than 10 years old.  When I did see it in the theaters, it blew me away and scared the poop out of me, and I was 19 years old.  The big question I have is how is it that the CGI was such a success in this film, especially being that it pioneered the CGI world???  It's almost as if they had the secret recipe and didn't give it out while other films since then have tried to duplicate the `real' effects using CGI, only to deliver something resembling an arcade game.  It's truly a shame we haven't advanced much beyond this level of `realness' with CGI.  You would think after 10 years of fine tuning it that we'd be seeing CGI actors in place of the real McCoy's and not be able to tell.  But yet we can't even get something like a guy in a spider suit or the Hulk to look real.  EITHER GET IT RIGHT, OR GIVE IT UP!!!This was an incredible movie, a 10 out of 10, why it only got 7.5, I'll never understand.  However there's beauty and tragedy that came out of this movie.  The beauty is that it gave birth to a new era of movie making with CGI, and did it well I might add.  The tragedy is that since then every action director has thought that CGI is the only way to go.  And tragically, here we are today with huge budget movies like Spiderman, which look incredibly fake.  I guess directors figure it's better to give you the wide angle fake looking CGI action sequences rather than the close up puppet / animatronics shots (which looks real).  So after watching Jurassic park again years later, I was astonished by how well it looks today and just had to spill my guts about it.  Hat's off to Spielberg again!",10,3,5,25 August 2004
Alien: Covenant," I was hoping for more...
","I had mixed thoughts about Prometheus overall. Certainly had to watch it more than once and then a few things made more sense, but overall the movie was all about setting up something more to come. This was the more to come and sadly it didn't deliver.I won't give anything away other than saying this movie was 75% a reboot of the original Alien, with 25% of Aliens 2 mixed in and that's about it. The characters were remarkably unmemorable, which again is status quo for this type of movie. So really I didn't care or give a second thought to any of the characters, and Michael's robotic performance of David or Walter wasn't anything memorable either.I dragged my friend to this movie as I'm a sucker for Alien's franchise, He fell asleep a few different times during the movie and I really don't blame him. It was slow and off beat. It wasn't suspenseful at all which really was the surprise as I know Scott knows what he's doing and knows how to do this, yet this movie had little to no suspense, therefore wasn't scary, and had little substance to it. So it really took away from that whole shock & awe that I loved so much from the original Alien as well as Prometheus which I thought also captured that aspect a bit.Special effects wise most everything was great except for the monster. Why is it they can CGI nearly everything great, but when it comes to the most important thing it looks hideously fake?!? Hey directors, here's a priceless tip. When someone's watching something and after they say 'wow, I didn't know that was GCI' that's an example of when GCI is great. However when you look at the monster for the first time and instantly say 'That's GCI...' That's an instant fail and bounces everything (well at least me) out of the movie. I understand directors are too close to the material to see the obvious errors, it's almost sad they can't have an impartial fan there for the ride to point out the 'Hey guys, I know you think this is great and all, but it looks like complete sh!t, and that's exactly what the audience is going to think...' I think that's worth it's weight in gold myself.To sum up, I found it a little dry, predictable, boring, and overall a disappointing sequel",3,6,12,28 May 2017
