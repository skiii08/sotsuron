The New World," Well crafted but simply misses the mark IMHO.
","I loved Thin Red Line....But I gotta say this movie just did not hit the mark. The cinematography is wonderful, the acting great as well. And although I love Malick, and Thin Red Line is far and away my favorite war move, I would wish there were more arcs in this. That is to say I wish the arc itself was more prominent. Malick tends to emphasize beauty and atmosphere it seems over plot or even melodrama, which is great, but this might be pushing it. Thin Red Line, I suppose, had the benefit of being a remake, and although one could call this a remake of course, it really isn't if you look at it objectively.I, respectfully, have to give this one a thumbs down for anyone but hardcore movie/history/Christian Bale/ or Colin Farrel fans.acexec",6,0,4,23 July 2006
The Illusionist," The Non-Prestige
","Let me first say that I had seen 'The Prestige' when it first came out, and was struck by how two so seemingly similar movies could come out at the same time...( like when a song called 'The Power' came out in the early 90s to several artists.Of course having seen the movie, the two have nothing in common. They are so different it is a shame to even compare them. That being said I consider both to be wonderful ways to spend a few hours.I like Edward Norton..on a scale of 1 to 10, I like him about a 7, but he doesn't appeal to me nearly as much as Christian Bale, a supreme actor in my opinion; and although Hugh Jackman has done some stinker movies, when he is good he is really good.Paul G. may not have had a perfect accent, his mannerisms certainly made up for it. Bravo to him, I love that guy.The shooting in each is lovely, with a slight edge to The Prestige. The acting is great in each with a slight edge to The Prestige as well. Where this movie has a victory is ironically in it's simplicity. It is far more conventional a movie than The Prestige ( as one would expect given the directors ).I think that although The Prestige will have a long lasting cult following, this movie will in the end get the most accolades due to it's accessibility-chronological plot, conventional romance sub-plot, etc.Either way we all win. Both movies are great.MAN NOTE - I give Scarlett the credit for a cute face, but Jessica is surely the more mature sexual woman :) BOTTOM LINE - This film 7.5/10 ( damn worth watching ) The Prestige 9/10 ( A must see in my humble opinion )",7,0,0,28 February 2007
The Thin Red Line," 8.5 / 10
","I have read alot of bad comments about this movie, and many before I first saw it 3 years ago.  I hesitated to see it because I had heard SO much negativity about it.  Naked Natives, Pretentious poetry, etc...I must say I thoroughly enjoyed it.  I like all kinds of movies, I am a true fan.  I like action, comedy, sci-fi, suspense, but this movie also holds distinction for me.  The pace is slow, yes, but if you have an attention span of longer than 5 minutes, and you have lived a little bit of life, you might enjoy this one.  It is very surrealistic, but it is often the vehicle of surrealism that allows us too see our own reality more clearly.  Unlike the 1964 original, the arcs are not clearly defined, and the conclusions aren't tightly resolved.  It is a different kind of film.  A trip if you will.  If you are relaxing at home on a Sunday, this movie is a good choice.AC",Null,0,1,20 July 2003
