The Blair Witch Project," IT DOESN'T GET BETTER THAN THIS!
",Probably the best horror flick ever made other than Exorcist. The Blair witch project brings out the fear that was buried down deep inside me. It made me feel the same way I felt during watching all those creepy Nightmare on Elm's Street' movies when I was a kid. I never thought that any movie could make those hairs at the back of my neck rise again. But how wrong I was? Although I was unlucky not to have an opportunity to watch this movie on big screen but still this one has struck me with full force. The idea to make a horror flick like a documentary gone haywire was so ingenious and yet so simple that one wonders why didn't somebody else thought about it earlier. But isn't that how all great things are? The cinematography is simply superb and Oscar worthy. Hats off to the whole idea of making a horror movie without any gory scenes. Its amazing how such trivial things as piled up rocks and twigs in particular shapes can make one shiver with fear. It will be difficult to top this one.,Null,0,1,3 January 2000
The Hurricane," Uncle Oscar, meet Denzel Washington! (Again)
","I always thought that there aren't many Afro American actors better than Denzel Washington, after watching Hurricane I believe there aren't many white one's either. In this brilliant film, which in my opinion is the best this year, Denzel gives the most beautiful performance of his career yet. It's simply superb. To be honest, I hadn't heard of Hurricane before Denzel got a well-deserved best actor award at Golden Globe. The award made me curious and I rented it last night and boy, what an experience that was! I just couldn't take my eyes of the screen for a fraction of a second. I knew I was watching a masterpiece, five minutes into it. It had been a long time since I have seen a movie that has touched my heart in the way Hurricane did. It made me realize just how much pain Rubin Carter, or any wrongly accused person for that matter, would have felt. And still, I fully believe in what Denzel says to Deborah Unger `You just can't understand how I feel cause you've never been in the prison'The movie is filled with scenes that would melt your heart and bring tears to your eyes. The one I found truly exceptional was the one when a convict Hemmings' mother comes to see him in prison and is told that his son is in lock up so she can't see him. The look on that lady's face would stay in my mind for a long time. Full marks to Norman Jewison.The supporting cast has performed really well but the star of the show is definitely Washington. If he doesn't get an Oscar for this one the case wouldn't be much different than that of the fight that Hurricane lost because of judges' biased decision. And the only thing then we might say won't be much different from what the commentator said on that match, i.e. `the judges must have been watching some other fight.'",Null,0,2,1 February 2000
Any Given Sunday," They are the warriors and it's a war!
","Oliver Stone is a very unconventional director and Any Given Sunday is a very conventional movie. But this doesn't means that it isn't good. In fact, it is one of the best sports movies I've ever seen, even though I am not much into American football. Therefore, the major attraction for me, was definitely the presence of a star cast in an Oliver Stone film. To see Al Pacino (one of the world's best actors) and Cameron Diaz (one of the world' s most beautiful girls) together with a supporting cast of stalwarts as Dennis Quaid and James Fox, is more than a dream come true. And each of them has performed very well. Al is great as usual; his short speeches before, after and in the middle of the game can make the blood rush in your veins. Cameron was always a great looker but shows that given a chance she's worth while actress too.The cinematography is Oliver Stone's trademark. Five minutes into the film and any film junkie can tell that this flick is directed by Stone. The game scenes are great; the tension, the excitement, the jubilation, the dejection are all so real that one can almost touch it.The portrayals of all the characters related to the game seem to emphasize on just one point: the players are more than mere sportsmen; they are warriors, the gladiators in the ring to fight till one of the fighters die. To drive home the analogy to Roman gladiators, Stone even shows a glimpse of Ben Hur on Pacino's TV.When I earlier said its conventional, I meant that the movie progresses in a predictable manner and one expects more than the oft repeated last second finish from a director of Stone's caliber. I think, what I really missed, were the characters like ones we saw in U turn and Natural Born Killers (which is, by the way, one of my all time favorites, particularly because of the back ground score by late Nusrat Fateh Ali, Pakistan's leading vocalist). Characters that are more than superficial and have a deep dark side that one thinks one sees but doesn't.However, Any Given Sunday is still a very good film and a must for all sports and film buffs alike.Piece of advice: Do leave the theatre till the credits end, it still is an Oliver Stone film!",Null,0,0,28 January 2000
The Sixth Sense," THE END!!!!!!!!
","It happened to me when I watched The Usual Suspects and Carlito's way and Shawshank Redemption. And it happened to me when I saw The Sixth Sense. I was lying flat on my back and sat up straight when it happened. If I could've seen my own face I can bet I would have never looked more bewildered than that moment. To me sixth sense was a good movie with superb acting and great direction five minutes before it ended. After those five minutes it transformed into a classic worthy of an Oscar nomination. It definitely has one of the best ends ever in the cinematic history.Bruce Willis has taken a leap from being a good actor to being a great one. His talents were utilized to hilt by the debutante director M. Night Shyamalan. Bruce has proven that there is much more in him than we saw in action flicks like Die Hard series and Last Boy Scout.  It will be unfair not to nominate him for the Oscar. There haven't been too many performances better than his, this year. But of course the revelation is Haley Joel Osment. He has given a gem of a performance so early in his career. The fear, the confusion, the lack of confidence, was portrayed in a manner that cannot be faulted. Its amazing how someone so young can firstly understand, and then deliver such a complex character. Full marks to him for giving probably the best juvenile performance ever. (Apologies to all those Home Alone lovers) And finally lets talk about M. Night Shyamalan. There could be no better way to start a career. He has made an ideal first move in what should be a long shining career. He knows his job well but most importantly one can't help feeling that this is a film made by someone who has thought, ate, slept this one for ages. It must have been really close to his heart and it shows. Lets keep our fingers crossed that he won't be a one-film wonder.",8,0,0,3 January 2000
