The Lobster," Most people will dislike the Lobster
","The Lobster is one of the most complicated movies ever.Certainly, The Lobster has its own philosophy, but it is not easy to understand it completely, aside of the themes of the movie.Perhaps, if one sees the movie more than once, he would be in the position to figure out what exactly is going on and what is the reason behind every incident.Like in Dogtooth, Lanthimos and Filippou used as a title for their project a symbolic object, but the connection between the lobster as an animal and the protagonist wasn't clear.The film is said to be full of symbolism about human relationships, but it is difficult to be identified from the first sight.It probably needs a lot of thinking to get the meaning and that is why limited viewers will understand it.Perhaps, you need to have a couple of notes with you from the writer and the director to understand what is happening in the film.The majority of people who watch movies are not geniuses, so to put them in a situation to guess what you mean with symbols is like a brain teaser.People watch movies for fun, to get amusement. If they wanted to solve mathematics they would apply in a Mathematics undergraduate program of a University.Lanthimos and Filippou have written simpler scripts in the past, so I believe that to write one like this, it was a product of an intended project. They might have done it for the Oscar, which they didn't win with the Dogtooth.The point is that you don't need to write something so weird to win an Oscar. Sometimes, the simpler things are more difficult to be shown than that and definitely worth more. I am not saying that this film hasn't merit. But most people won't see it at all.To win an Oscar, you must be comprehensible and I don't think that every person is in the position to be connected with that movie.There were also some provoking incidents in the Lobster such as deaths and shootings, which in my opinion must not be taught through the cinema.Fortunately, some cruel scenes were avoided, but still there were sad things included. Of course, this is how life is. There are good and bad things, so someone must know it all. But entertaining the audience is the most important thing, not to pose him more problems. And with the Lobster you have to surmise what is meant through the allegories of people's actions.It was a very carefully applied project and it deserves the respect of everyone, but it is cursed to be liked by a particular audience, which is not the majority of cinema addicts.As an experiment, it is clever and it is evolutionary for the cinema to have movies like this one, so, as a part of the film industry, the Lobster is a worthy project. It has quality, especially for those who become identified with the story and the way it is flourished.The Lobster is a valuable movie for the cinema, regardless of the people who might find it extremely peculiar and incomprehensible. As a film, it is very interesting, but it is much more when you heard what the story is about than the content.",7,4,12,21 December 2015
The Danish Girl," The Danish Girl is a guide to the saved soul
","The Danish Girl is not just a simple story of a man who wants to be a woman. It is a shocking story.It is not a pleasant movie in terms of making you laugh, but it can teach you a lot of lessons.It is about people who don't know themselves and suddenly something happens in their life and they want to change forever.That is what happened to Einar (Eddie Redmayne). In his case, a game led him to the most serious thing: to realize what his dream identity is.It cannot be by luck that this man was an artist, a painter, inasmuch art is a method of self-searching in the soul and the mind. Einar hadn't acknowledged that he missed something and he found it through a joke.Einar wants to be loved for Lilly, not Einar who just disguises in Lilly. The sadness of a person who seeks to find his own identity is extremely revealed in the movie.He is trying to prove that he is not insane, just different from other people. He wants to be something else from what he was born and he has the right, but bullying towards him is inevitable.The doctors all want to cure him, even lock him in a psychiatric hospital, but Einar knows he is not for that.His girlfriend, Gerda, loves him and wants to help him, so she is to blame a lot for Einar's condition, as she kind of pushed him into that. She even used him to produce exceptional paintings, which showed his female part of him. Perhaps, that was her sin. Einar's wish to become a woman may even reveal a vacuum in their relationship. Maybe he is too identified with his girlfriend.Most people will mock Einar for transforming into Lilly, but a lot of other people will be able to see beyond that: to see his soul and what his soul needs to be healed.I don't think that Einar likes men and that is the reason he wants to be a woman. He wants to be a woman because he admires women regardless of his sexual orientation as of what kind of people he wants around him. Einar lets a woman be born in him and he battles through two different sexes. So, he is confused and doesn't know who of the two selves to keep. Apart from the war he has inside of him, he has the war of the other people who can't understand him and follow stereotypes. Even already having a woman's soul, Einar does want to become a woman in display in order people to know him as a woman.It is strange that his girlfriend didn't leave him, but stayed with him and believed also that Einar is not a man but a woman. It is a sign of braveness, but also, through a different perspective, a false behaving towards a sick person.Of course, what Einar passed through might be only an illusion, a transient mood. Sometimes, people believe some things and after a period of time not, so it is kind of strange that Einar took the decision quite early. He was confident too early. He might have better waited to see whether it was just a moment of madness. I didn't like the end. It was too sad. If Einar had escaped this momentum, maybe he wouldn't want to become a woman, but that we will never know it.The film speaks about things that shock the community: people who want to change sex, people who want people of the same sex, love triangles.But in life only matters what makes us happy, whatever it is and whatever the other people would say about that.In this case, the coincidence is never a coincidence, as it helps you find what you want in life.The movie reminds us how cruel it can be to 'dare' to have a dream of being something so abnormal for the community.The film also teaches us that the image can be a fallacy, so, the soul counts. When a man sees a woman becomes attracted to her. He doesn't know if she is really a woman or a man who just disguises into a woman.The film keeps the interest even of the people who are not much interested in the story as a first read of the plot.Its success lies upon that it presents everything in intense. The feelings of the two protagonists are very strong and this makes this movie very touching.It is a journey to find who you really are and what you really want in life.",8,0,4,26 December 2015
