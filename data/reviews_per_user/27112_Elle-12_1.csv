The Sound of Music," My all-time favourite movie
","This movie would have to be the greatest musical of all time. There has never been a more memorable movie moment than that when the camera zooms in on Julie Andrews in the very first seen and then she sings 'The Sound of Music.' That scene, and Julie's beautiful voice left an impact on nearly everyone that saw the movie. I loved this movie as a child, I love it now, and I will love it for the rest of my life. It's a real jem that touches the heart, more of a legend than a movie. While some may call it 'corny', I could watch it again and again and never tire of it. It very much deserved it's Best Picture award. Everyone who has seen this movie will remember it for a lifetime.",10,1,7,23 March 1999
