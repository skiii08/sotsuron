The Avengers," Great; For Children...
","I loved the original 'The Avengers' film (1961). For this version, however, it is far different. In my opinion, any actor who takes a role in this film or similar can only have 1 (or bith) of 2 reasons: The money and making children happy. I fully appreciate both. Unfortunately for fans, if you are over the age of 13 years old and enjoy this, well good for you. For me, I think anyone older who participates in watching this (or similar) type of film, it is exactly what is ruining the cinematic 'universe', for lack of a better word. Please don't misunderstand me; there is a place for 'comic book' movies. Unfortunately, they are so heavily packaged and promoted, it is detracting from the world of artistic films. If I sound snobbish, so be it. Director Martin Scorcese was recently quoted in a British TV interview (BBC?). In it, he pointed out this situation: The heavy promotion, packaging and large numbers of this type of film has caused more and more independent theaters to close. He received a large number of complaints from fans of Marvel Comics, DC Comics, etc. In response to this 'pushback' he wrote an Op-ed in the New York Times. In it he could have taken the words from my mouth. It is a shame. When I lived in New York City from the 1980s until 2016, there were many more independent theaters. Not only smaller places like 'Angelika Film Center', which (fortunately) has expanded to other cities, or 'The Film Forum', or 'The Quad'; but all the large independent theaters in Times Square. They were torn down and replaced with hotels and/or other types of buildings. This was all a big part of Rudolph Giuliani's tenure as mayor. His 'Quality of Life Issues'. Yes, he succeeded in arresting people or issuing citations to (mostly homeless) people for panhandling, or 'squeegee boys' at traffic bottlenecks who would wipe your windshield with buckets of dirty water. He talked about (I'm paraphrasing) 'Cleaning up the pornos and peep shows' in Times Square. Well, he did this, and then some. Unfortunately, the large theaters I just mentioned went out the window, too. He turned turned Times Square into 'Disneyworld'. Prior to this 'ravagement', I used to love going to Times Square late on a Friday or Saturday night, and catch a midnight or 1:00 AM showing of some big new action film, like 'Terminator: Judgement Day', or 'Lethal Weapon'. It was fun, simply because the audience participated. They were loud and raucus, which fit this type of film perfectly. It was great! On the other hand, if I wanted to see a great new independent film (quietly), I would typically go to Angelika Film Center. I did this because I lived only a few streets west, just off of Houston Street in Soho. I could walk there in less than 5 minutes (door to door). Anyway, if you enjoy thiskind of movie, great. All I am saying is be aware of the 'big picture', which Mr. Scorcese so eloquently wrote about.",3,1,3,12 December 2019
The Legend of Bagger Vance," A Very Good Film
","I like this film, even with all it's golf goofs and the like. There are some real truths, but overall you must remember this is a fantasy film. The casting is quite good; especially Charlize Theron, Matt Damon and Will Smith is brilliant. Joel Gretsch is just right as Bobby Jones. The supporting cast is very good. The only person who I thought was odd is Bruce McGill, who is supposed to be a 'ladies man'. That is 1 thing McGill isn't. Although he has good dialogue and is a truly fine actor, he is simply wrong for this role. I can think of a dozen actors who would have been better. Overall, however, it is a feel good film. I also like 'The Greatest Game Ever Played' (2005) is a true story; with Stephen Dillane, Shia LaBeouf and Elias Koteas. It has some flaws as well, but works quite well. Dillane is excellent as Harry Vardon.
The best golf film, for me, is 'Bobby Jones: Stroke of Genius' (2004), with Jim Caveziel in the lead, Claire Forlani and a slew of excellent supporting actors, like Malcom McDowell in a (rare) protagonistic role along with Jeremy Northam, who is truly brilliant as Walter Hagen, plus Aiden Quinn as Harry Vardon. So enjoy; all 3 films have their moments.",8,1,3,28 May 2019
Spartacus," A Fearless 30 Year Old Stanley Kubrick Directs The Best of the Best
","My title says it all. Talk about fearless, any other director would be terrified directing this cast. Stanley Kubrick was only 30 years old. He had already made 'Paths of Glory' (1957). In my opinion, that was 1 of his 2 greatest films: 'Paths of Glory' and 'A Clockwork Orange' (1971). 'Spartacus' was a challenge Kubrick met; however, he did not have final cut. Kirk Douglas did, for a very simple reason: Kirk produced 'Spartacus'. Kubrick vowed he would never to allow this after making his next film ('Lolita' in 1962). After 'Lolita', Stanley truly had 'final cut'. This would last until the day he died (March 7th 1999).",10,0,1,4 February 2020
Training Day," Superb Film
","Denzel Washington wins Best Actor Oscar but Ethan Hawke deserved one as well. He was nominated for Best Supporting Actor, but lost. I truly thought he was just as good as Denzel. Also, screenplay was brilliant by William Monahan, who has gone on yo dutect srveral bery good films: my favorite is 'London Boulevard' (2010). Ethan Hawke is so good in the last 1/3 it yhe film. From the moment he leaves 'Smileys' (Cliff Curtis, who is excellent). Scott Glenn is miscast to me, however. No way he can play a real dealer. I know first hand. The only other part I didnt buy (but it looked cool) is when Ethan Hawke goes to his neighborhood & house. There is no way; truly, no way he could walk through that street without getting blasted in real life. Regardless, it is nice for people to think a white dude could do so; but no way my friends. Still, it is an excellent film.",9,1,3,19 September 2019
The Irishman," Terrific
","It is so good to see Martin Scorsese have all the time he needs to tell a story. Especially in a film that he obviously loves. The cast leaves no one out, and I am not simply singling out the lead roles. As is sometimes the case, he doesn't have many women who have big roles. This film is based on a documentary. I like the fact he casts many younger and/or not as well known actors. Like 'Goodfellas' (1990), this story is told by a central character. Also, it is hard not to consider other films he has made. All this aside, 'The Irishman' stands up firmly on it's own. We are very fortunate to have a handful of directors who are not making films based on 'super hero comic books'. I am so sick of that type of movie, where it is boxed, packaged, marketed and (finally) shoved down people's throats. This is a must see film.",9,1,6,27 November 2019
The Hustler," Excellent Film
","I love this film. It was the second film I saw starring Paul Newman. 'Somebody Up There Likes Me' (1956) was the first, which is the biopic of legendary middleweight boxer Rocky Graziano. My older brother used to work in a billiards hall, and was a very good straight pool player as well. In straight pool, the table is larger and the pockets are smaller; which makes it quite difficult. It also makes you a much better player on a standard size table. In addition, a very close friend of mine's father played Willie Mosconi in an exhibition game. Mosconi, who was one of the greatest pool players of all time, does the one trick shot in the film (known as a masse shot). Other than that, Jackie Gleason (who is a brilliant player himself) and Paul Newman did all their own shots in the film.",8,2,2,13 November 2016
Aquaman," Not Bad
","Its funny seeing the characters played Patrick Wilson & others who are the nemesis of Arthur/Aquaman, played by Jason Momo. I have been a fan of Jason Momoa ever since the 2nd season of Stargate Atlantis. Unlime Wilson & the other actors, Jason has real muscles, & tgey are not from lifting weights. He is also a very bright individual, who has oroduced & directed seceral shorts & a couple of feature length independent films aswell. He doesnt beed a ouffed up muscle bound suit, which is why you see him shirtless. Trust me, he is more like actirs similar to Gerard Butler & Chris Hemsworth. They all posess that rare combination of talent and beauty; nit just oretty hunks with no brains (who are a dime a dozen). One coincidence is Michael Beach plays the father of 'Black Manta' (pirates), who Aquaman allows to drown, whuch Nanta seejs revenge for; which in itself is actually quite stupid. He & his father were murderers & pirates: they chose the life. Regardless, my point is Jason Momia & Michael Beach both were on Stargate Atlantis (as allies). Momoa was cast in over 75 epusodes; Beach was on about 6 episides. Even though Momia was on Game of Thrones & seceral other series, Stargate Atlantis is the one which made him a star with a huge fanbase. He deserves it, & I am happy for him. This film is all about CGI special effects, which (for me) are quite boring. Lastly, it is a comuc book film, whose fanbase is mostly preteens: they are all about the mighty dollar. At least Jason gets to make much more money plus move him up into the 'A-List' of action film stars. This will allow him to make many more films of his own; which is much better than pablum like this.",6,1,3,11 August 2019

Lost in Translation," Sofia Coppola's First
","I remember seeing Ms. Coppola in Godfather 3, opening night. I was living in NY City (Soho) in a tiny flat; 4th floor walkup. I thought she was poorly cast (not her fault; her father's). Regardless, she has a terrific eye, which is a valuable tool, for her job. This film, which I did not see until years it's release, totally blew me away with it's overall vision. When you consider this was made on the tiniest of a budget, with a very small cast and crew; plus it is all shot on location in Tokyo (and surrounding areas), and stars Scarlett Johansson and Bill Murray: This is quite a feat. Of course, the actors, which also include Giovanni Ribisi, who is very good at playing a workaholic photographer married to Ms. Johansson's character (woefully oblivious to the needs of his brilliant and beautiful wife). I know Ms. Coppola is helped by people who know her father. By this, I mean it must help her in the choices made for her crew and casting. That noted, I don't care who her father is or isn't; she is extremely talented as a director, which is proven by this film especially (her first, no less), and her subsequent work. Looking at the money only, I noticed the budget was only $4 million, but the worldwide gross is well over $100 million. That is a tremendous success financially. This is great, but from my standpoint as a seriou film fan, (and I'm sure hers, as well), she has made a remarkably good film that anyone would be proud of-I surely am. Having met Bill Murray, (a co. I owned in NY City worked for him in 1990), I can tell you he is a truly authentic actor: What you see on the screen is pretty much what you see if you talk with him for a couple of hours. He is a hilarious and charming person; no pretension at all. I know how good Bill Murray is. Scarlett Johansson truly stunned me, considering she was only 17 years old when this film was made, and, first realeased. It is a special, one of a kind film; a must see.",9,1,3,14 April 2019
Interstellar," Exceptional
","This is a very good film, if not great. I found the final segment, when Cooper basically explains the film's meaning(s) to no one in particular (meaning the audience), to be condescending and annoying. Other than this, it is very good. That said, I don't think it even compares with '2001: A Space Odyssey', which Stanley Kubrick began making exactly 50 years before this film was released. The 'IMDB Top 250 Films' list, which has almost every Christopher Nolan film he has made in the top 50 (not his fault) doesnt have a single film made by Stanley Kubrick in the top 50. This speaks volumes as to the caliber of amateur 'film critics' (myself included) to be quite ignorant, in my opinion. So, this film was a letdown for me, but what was I expecting after the same director that made 3 films about 'Batman', a comic book character (all in the top 50 of course). To show my objectivity, I think his film 'The Prestige' to be brilliant; my favorite amongst Mr. Nolan's body of work. I gave it 7 stars, and I am being generous.",8,0,0,12 November 2018
Pacific Rim," Good For Idris Elba
","I am a very big fan of Idris Elba, going far back. He really made a great impression on Ridley Scott's 'Prometheus' (2012), an 'Alien' prequel. This film, however, owes a lot to 'Godzilla Against Mechagodzilla' (2002). Yes, that tiny budget Japanese film is very similar. Think about it: Giant organic monsters are fought by giant (human controlled) mechanical monsters. Nuff said.",6,0,1,5 October 2019
Forrest Gump," Copy of 'Being There'
","Although this is set in a different era, it draws heavily upon Peter Sellers' masterpiece performance in 'Being There' (1979). So much is identical to what Sellers' character, 'Chauncey Gardner' becomes in 'Being There'. Tragically, Sellers died the following year at age 54. Regardless, Forrest Gump is well deserving of the excellent reception it receiv ed; both critically and at the box office. However, to this day, I cannot compare to the superiority of Sellers comedic skills. Most people agree he was the greatest comedic actor of the 20th Century, and that includes me. Having been cast in 2 Stanley Kubrick films: 'Lolita' (1962) and 'Dr. Strangelove' (1964) shows how much respect he got from the master of all directors (Kubrick). While making Dr. Strangelove, he plays 4 different roles, including the eponymous Dr. Strangelove. Kubrick was 'rolling on the floor with laughter; egging Peter Sellers on to even higher heights', as Christiane Kubrick said on the DVD or Bluray discs. So this is why I don't give 'Gump' a higher rating; the writers and director ripped off 'Being There'; plain and simple.",8,0,2,22 September 2019
The Bourne Ultimatum," Quite Good
","I like 'The Bourne Identity' (2002) the best as it was the 1st in the whole 'Bourne' series of films. There have now been 5 films. The 2nd was okay, and this one is much better than the 2nd. Then Jeremy Renner came in the 4th installment, and finally Matt Damon came back for the final film 'Bourne' with super celebrity star Alicia Vikander, and tired old Tommy Lee Jones, who is woefully miscast. Those last 2 films are the worst. It shows how studios will wring the last possible dollar out of something which was very good; then when they should have quit, they go downhill all the way. I was surprised Matt Damon did it; they must have paid him a lot of money. There was nothing new; only a name plus action does not make a film interesting. For me, the plot was gone completely after this film, which is quite good. It's funny; after this, Joan Allen was cast in 'Death Race' (2008); starring Jason Statham and Tyrese Gibson; plus Ian McShane, Jason Clarke and Natalie Martinez. It's so gory, it's funny. Anyway, this is a good film. It still has the plot, and pretty much closed it all for me.",8,0,0,31 May 2019
Oblivion," Good, But Not great
","I don't understand why so many critics trashed this film. It was quite good, but had room for improvement. That said, for a 2nd time director (of his own film, no less), I give a lot of props to Joseph Kosinski and Tom Cruise as well for the world Kosinski created and brought it to life. Something I cannot stand is Vika's nightgown. Whoever was in charge of wardrobe made a very good suit for Jack, but Vika's nightgownl is like something from your grandmother's closet. For that matter, her dress is pretty bad as well. Regardless, it's a film I liked as much as or more than 'Elysium'(2013), but not near as much as 'Prometheus' (2012). Ironically, some of that was filmed in Iceland also, which is where Noomi Rapace grew up (the star of 'Prometheus'), and visited family and friends while shooting there. I look forward to Kosinski's next film, as 'Brave' (2017) is not really my cup of tea. We shall see.",8,2,2,6 December 2018
The Bourne Identity," Terrific
","As with most action (and other type) films now, the first of the best. That is absolutely true here. The Jason Bourne series of films, which is at 5 and counting now, is quite good. After the 3rd film, I thought it was already wearing thin, and had closure. One thong you can count on, is when a studio has a hit, they will wear it out, and that is proven here. When the 4th and 5th versions came out, it simply became a game of seeing how many different people can be roped into the same roles. I just saw this film again on HBO (of course; it's 17 years old now!). Even though I have seen this at least a dozen times, it's the 1st time I noticed Walton Goggins in it, who has been cast in a slew of films the past decade. I had noticed Gabriel Mann before in several fims, but the 1st time I noticrd Goggins was in 'Predators' (2010). Anyway, I still like this film very much; it launched a whole genre, in my opinion. Soeaking of multiple films, the extreme are the 'Fast & Furious' films. The film series should have stopped long before Paul Walker was killed in a high speed car wreck. The true face of greed shone brightly when the studio (and actors) kept making them; it is incredibly disrespectful to have done so. Pardon the digression. This film, 'The Bourne Identity', is terrific. I liked how Doug Liman handled the end, with Franka Potente is found by Matt Damon, and (ultimately) kindle a relationship.My main problem is Clive Owen doesn't have a larger role. He is truly a brilliant actor. He made up for it, hiwever over tge nrxt decade; appearing in many excellent films, like 'Children of Men', 'The International' (which the big shootout in 'John Wick 2' copied completely, and not half as well), etc.",9,1,1,11 February 2019
The Matrix Revolutions," Forgetabble

The Caine Mutiny," Mediocre
","Its a shame the Navy wouldn't allow a film to be made showing mutiny on a US ship, because thus is exactly what occurred on this film. Not only that, but tge Navy required the studio to put a statement on the screen just as ut begins: (Paraphrasing) 'There has never been a mutiny aboard any US Navy ship', etc. It's way over the top in which the studio was limited as to what the Navy would ir wouldn't allow to be shown, it takes the 'heart' right out if the film. This is truly traguc, simply because it was made during the 'McCarthy Era' (the 1950s) when the fear of 'Communism' was set ablaze by Senator Joe McCarthy, the he 'fanned the flames'. He had a committee which succeeded in blackballing a dozen great screen writers and numerous other movie Hollywood people: some of the very best. Consequently, a brilliantly cast film had it's 'claws removed' and was 'de-fanged' (to use 'feline' euphemisms). Besides Humphrey Bogart, you have Fred McMurray, Van Johnson, Jose Ferrer, and even a young Lee Marvin. Overall, it is the opposite of a brilliant film made 38 years later: 'A Few Good Men' (1992), which the US Navy did not like, and threw their weight around on it, too. However, they didn't really succeed at stopping anything. Amazingly, 'The Caine Mutiny' received 7 Academy Award nominations, Including Best Picture and Best Actor. Overall, I don't like it. All because of the Nacy censorship was so powerful at the time. It ruoned the entire plot. I still rated it at 5 stars; simply for the cast and what tgey did manage to show.",5,1,6,18 September 2019

Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," Bad, But Humorous
","(12/29/2019). For me, this is the 2nd worst film in the entire 6 volume 'Terminator' films. If you go by numbers, only 'Terminator Genisys' (2015), is the absolute worst, simply because the crew & director took it completely seriously. It is absolutely woeful. On the other hand, this film is far too comical. For me, I like the original film the most. It was made in 1984. This was a time when James Cameron had very few resources. However, as a result of the commercial success, 2 years later he released 'Aliens' (1986); the sequel to Ridley Scott's brilliant 1979 film ('Alien'). Highly successful commercially, plus Sigourney Weaver got a 'Best Actress' Oscar nomination. 3 years later he made the most commercially successful of all the 'Terminator' films with 'Terminator 2: Judgement Day' (1992). For Cameron, the rest is history. Next came this film, then (the 4th) 'Terminator Salvation' (2009) which was very well cast (but no Arnold!), plus it had a decent script. Then the aforementioned (horrible) 5th film, 'Terminator Genisys' (2015). Finally, after 3 different directors had poor to mediocre success, James Cameron returns to this genre. It is after he has made 'Titanic' (1997) and Avatar' (2009). Only now he has both Arnold Schwarznegger and Linda Hamilton in the 6th (and hopefully last) film in this series with 'Terminator: Dark Fate'. It was just released (Nov. 1, 2019) to mixed reviews. Regardless, this film has a few decent moments. I do like Arnold, Nick Stahl and Claire Danes. Also, it gave Kristanna Loken a big break.",6,1,4,29 December 2019
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," Overrated
","I liked this film. However, I saw it opening weekend in Times Square (Manhattan, NYC). It was fun to watch, but the dialogue is so ridiculous, it is funny (in all the wrong places). I mean, most of the audience was roaring with laughter during the 'driving down the highway at night' scenes. Those are when Sarah Conner is doing the truly woeful voice overs about 'no future but what we make' and so on. I swear if James Cameron had been there he would have freaked out. He is so overrated as a director. It simply shows how ignorant people are when you see how financially successful a film can be, which has truly pitiful dialogue. I cringe during some of the lines people have. I also understand why so many people refuse to work with him because he is extremely careless (ask anyone who worked on 'The Abyss'); he is dangerous.",8,6,13,5 January 2017
The Patriot," Worth The Watch
","I like this film. It is directed by Roland Emmerich. Mel Gibson & fellow Australian Heath Ledger are realistic as father and son. This is the film which turnedill-fated Ledger into a heart-throb. Even a very young Logan Lerman plays one of Gibson's sons. Jason Isaacs is perfectly cast as the primary antagonist. He has made a career of playing 'the bad guy'. Tom Wikinson, Adam Baldwin and Chris Cooper round out the powerful cast. There is truly outstanding cinematography by Caleb Deschsnel which is accompanied by the excellent soundtrack by John Williams. However, it tends to be more dramatic & romantic, as opposed to realistic. Personally, I prefer the outstanding film 'The Last of the Mohicans' (1992) led by Daniel Day-Lewis, Madeleine Stowe Russell Means, Eric Schweig, & Jodhi May. It is superbly directed by Michael Mann. Regardless, 'The Patriot' is still a great watch & well worth the time. A solid 8 in my book.",8,1,1,3 June 2020

The Exorcist," Absolutely Brilliant and Terrifying
","When it comes to horror, this is the pinnacle of it in film making. A very close 2nd is 'Alien' (1979), & 3rd is 'Stabley Kubrick's 'The Shining' (1980). I remember when The Exorcist came out, and had lines around the block outside film theaters. It was rated 'X' (now known as 'NC-17') by the MPAA. It was later drooped to 'R', although varying editions ate available. Mercedes McCambridge is stunning as the voice of the Devil, and actually didn't receive proper credit for this until later. Regardless, it is a brilliant film by 1 of the greatest American directors, William Friedkin. Unfortunately, it was released the same year as 'The Godfather' (1973), which swept the Academy Awards the following year. That is irrelevant to me. The book by William Peter Blatty is terrifying as well. Blatty wrote the screenplay, which was excellent. A must see, even now; over 45 years later.",10,0,0,2 April 2019
Avengers: Endgame," Per For Pre Pubescent Kids
","I'm going to make a leap here, just to leep things simple. The cumulative effect of so called 'super heroes' is to the true film fan what the white man was to Native Americans: End of life as they knew it. There are 25 actors in this, and it's really sad to see them become prostitutes, like their studios. Why do you think great actors and directors wouldn't be caught dead in these cartoon films? Because they are the antithesis to great film making. Its really sad. I understand my 13 year old daughter seeing something like this. I don't understand older, more mature people acting like these are real films becauseT they arent. They are like the cartoons you woukd watch, before the main attraction started. They all have been dumbed down for the masses to the same exact plot: Good versus Evil; always. I wouldn't, no couldn't; sit through 15 minute of this pablum, not even if you paid me a year's salary to watch. It's woeful trash, and is ruining the film industry. Stanley Kubrick the master of all the great directors, is rolling over in his grave. You won't see the top directors making any of this trash. People like Abel Ferrara, Marty Scorcese, Ridley Scott, William Friedkin, Spike Lee, or Denis Villeneuve go near a movie such as this. Its all publicity! All you hear about is how much money is made in the opening weeks, but nothing about what the films are like. It makes me sick. I would rather have my teeth drilled without novacaine than watch this. The same goes for the best actors. No way you will see ever see people like Bobby DeNiro, Christopher Walken, Matt Damon, Colin Farrell, Ethan Hawke, Nicole Kidman, or Al Pacino in any of these movies. I understand completely. It's simple. They have integrity! Skip this woeful hyped up trash and go see a real film; not a cartoon.",1,165,285,30 July 2019
Tigerland," Outstanding
","All things considered, it is an absolutely stunning film. The decision by director Joel Schumacher to use virtually unknown actors in the film was a genious move. It took a lot of courage, bot to mention skill, in training the actors in the platoon to train together. At least 6 of them have gone on to become exceptional actors, with Colin Farrell becoming a true Hollywood star. A couple of years later, Farrell was cast opposite Al Pacino (an actor he idolized in his youth) in 'The Recruit'. It was a successful film. Afterwards, Pacino said (a now oft repeated phrase) that Colin Farrell is tbe best actor of his generation. I agree 100%. Tigerland is a gritty, taut film, and blew me away the first time I saw it. By the way, my family home is about 45 miles from the real Tigerland in Louisiana, and yours truly came within an inch of being sent there during the Vietnam War",9,1,3,2 November 2018
Pawn Sacrifice," Brilliant
","Toney Maguire is outstanding in thus period piece. Unlike most 'biopics', this film truly works. This is due to strict adherence to the true story of Bobby Fischer: The greatest chess player in history, who was also had serious mental wealth issues. I remember watching this match live. It is compelling, and sometimes very difficult to watch. I believe this is the best performace of Tobey Maguire's career. Forget about all the comic book Spiderman bruhaha. This is a gut punch of realism. Kudos to director Edward Zwick.",9,1,1,27 May 2020
The Greatest Game Ever Played," Good Cast, Poor Direction
","Stephen Dillane is brilliant as Harry Vardon, and Shia LeBeouf is terrific as well. Unfortunately, one of the primary antagonists played by Peter Firth, is woefully overdone. He is dressed almost like a clown, with ill fitting clothes: His pants are 6' too long, coupled with a hat.much too large. Since it's a Disney film, there is no swearing at all to the detriment of the film. For example, theTed Ray character calls someone a 'toffee nosed git', as if that is humorous. Trust me; it isn't. Lastly, every single chance Firth's character makes way, way over the top disparaging comments about Franxis Ouimet (Shia LeBeouf); so much so they really dumb the film down to a level that basically ruined what could have been a much better film. Bill Paxton was not a great director. Acting, he was quite good, and it is sad he died at a relatively young age. He must have had a lot of help making this, but it was to no avail; even though it is based on a true story which is followed better than most 'docu-dramas'. It's worth a single watch, but there are a couple of other golf films which have much more to offer, and work much better.",6,0,0,3 July 2019

","I saw Anthony Burgess on 'The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson'. I only remember 1 thing Burgess said: 'I am obsessed with words'. I read the book as soon as I could. Then, the film came out almost simultaneously. I saw it 3 days in a row, which is what I used to do whenever a great film came out. I was 17 years old, and it was absolutely a mind-blowing film for me. I know (and own) every film Kubrick made, and for me, this is a tie with 'Paths of Glory' (1957) as my 2 favorites. An absolutely brilliant film, made on a shoestring budget, too. If you buy the bluray disc, which came out about 2007, it has hours and hours of interviews with McDowell, other actors, directors, etc. BTW, McDowell's favorite actor is James Cagney.

","I like this film. Although it is not based in fact, it follows the Jack the Ripper cases as it's primary theme. Although never completely solved, in more recent times, it was narrowed down to 4 suspects. The most likely (to my knowledge) is man who moved from London to New York City. The dates fit the records of this person's passage by ship to New York City. Moreover, this man killed at least 2 more women, and was subsequently executed in New York State. This is still a very good adaptation. The casting is very good. There are some flaws in 'over the top' responses. These range from the Chief of Police, numerous doctors, and the average man on the street. In closing, I like the Hughes Brothers a lot. They have made several excellent films. Although not their best work, I include this one as a must see.",8,0,1,26 March 2020
Thor," A Shame
","I just watched this for the first time; fast forwarding through the CGI trash. I stopped after Hemsworth and his friends flew back to Asgard. I look at this 'film' as a perfect example of what started the end of true cinema. It only proves a simple fact: If anything is packaged and marketed enough (whatever 'anything' may be), the masses will accept it. The very best story telling via cinema us done by a small handful of incredibly gifted directors. Unfortunately, the best are dead; however, there are still a few who are exceptional. This and all other comic book films are not amongst them. Enjoy it all you want; just don't try and compare it with real artists: people like the two best masters of them all: Stanley Kubrick and Orson Welles. We still have Marty Scorcese, Terrence Malick, Neal Jordan, Ridley Scott and his heir apparent, Denis Villeneuve. So this ( and other 'superhero') type of movie is great if you're 13 years old. If your in your 20's and up, forget it. I suggest watching every film Kubrick made: a dozen plus one he removed. Also, all of the actor Steve McQueen's films (not today's director, who is good); lastly all the great 1970's films. Then make up your mind. As Martin Scorcese wrote an op-ed in the New York Times recently, he basically explained he wasn't denigrating this type of film in an interview he had done in Great Britain. He received a lot of pushback which is why he wrote the op-ed: To explain how these type of films, studios, theaters and their P.P. and marketing strategies done on Late night talk shows promoting themselves (so to speak), they have caused an extreme loss of Independent films (and their corresponding theaters). I agree with him 100%.",5,0,0,21 November 2019
The Matrix Reloaded," Boring Pablum
",What A joke. Both sequels stink. Only the first one is so memorable. Both this film and the 3rd (Revolutions) are simply money making tools. Woefully done.,7,3,5,29 December 2019
Zero Dark Thirty," Average as a whole, and sub-par for Kathryn Bigelow
","As someone who was working (and lived) in lower Manhattan, I have a different viewpoint for this film, just as all people who were living in NYC do when the WTC was destroyed. Everything was much more palpable. As thousands of other people did, I lost a very close friend (an FDNY Captain) who was inside Tower 1. As far as the film goes, I have no thoughts as far as morality and torture issues are depicted. We all know anything just about anything (within reason) would be done to capture and/or kill bin Laden. I do care about the quality of the film goes, as I am a very big fan of Kathryn Bigelow and Jessica Chastain. Unfortunately, I got very tired of seeing Maya write down how many days had gone by, over and over, ad infinitum. I believe many people were miscast. Also, for some reason I cannot really point to, the film just didn't do much for me. Perhaps I was sick of hearing about it., having lived through so much of it, so close to my heart.Other than what I already mentioned, what I remember the most is the burnt plastic smell which permeated lower Manhattan for weeks, and numerous other seemingly innocuous things that only residents who were there can relate to.BTW, bin Laden was killed on my birthday.",6,2,4,6 January 2018
The Wrestler," Very Good
","I was pleasantly surprised by the performance of Micky Rourke; an actor of enormous talent. He changes a lot, and I don' mean all the plastic surgery he has had. I am talking about his versatility. I remember when he and Eric Roberts made 'Tge Pope of Greenwich Village' years ago. He was a huge hit; especially in France. I mever understood why; maybe for tbe same readon I don't know why Jerry Lewis was such a hit in France as well, although for much different reasons. Darren Aronosvsky's direction is brilliant as well. It is a must see film.",8,1,1,5 November 2018
Sherlock Holmes," Quite Good
","I think Robert Downy, JR. and Mark Strong are terrific in this film. Rachel McAdams is lovely and brilliant as ever. Top it off with Jude Law, and you have a wonderful film. Albeit somewhat pretentious, it is still worth the watch. I don't want to spoil anything; simply advise seeing this 20th telling of the 'World of Sherlock Holmes'.",8,0,0,5 February 2020
Arrival," Brilliant
","I can't think of any film with aliens which is non-fear based, which eant to help us as well. 'Close Encounters', etc. is non threatening, but has no true meaning. Also, in order to fully understand this film, I had to watch it a second time. If you don't, you will miss at least some of the multi-layered stories being told. The part about her daughter, her precognition, etc. are pretty obvious. What took me in the second viewing was this: I came to the conclusion that when Louise is 'remembering the future', for lack of a better term, time stops in everyone else's space-time continuum. In other words, several minutes may pass while she is thinking/remembering about her daughter, but time does not for the others. There are a couple of exceptions, but this is a primary part of the film that I missed the first viewing. Also, it grew on me the next time as well. It is truly brilliant, and without Amy Adams, I dont think it would have been as good; I don't care who else you can think of. The director said the same thing: he had to have her, or he wouldn't make the film. BTW, Stanley Kubrick said the same exact thing about Malcolm McDowell in 1970 before he began filming 'A Clockwork Orange'. Keanu Reeves absolutely flipped he liked this film so much. I agree. It is hard to top. I liked it more than 'Blade Runner 2049'; absolutely. I think Villeneuve is at the pinnacle right now. Even Ridley Scott has competition in this regard, and he produced BR 2049.",10,2,5,4 November 2018
Arrival," Brilliant
","This is bu far the best science fiction film I have seen in a decade, at least. For once, the aliens are not the antagonists. They are brilliant, and helpful. Plus, it is a story within a story; nit an easy film to fully grasp the first time I saw it. It took a 2nd screening to really have it sink in. I especially like the fact that instead of 'dumbing down' this film, they assumed a level of higher intelligence from the audience, which is (partially) why it works so well. Denis Villeneuve is on top of the director's world right now. I don't care hiw many awards are given to Alfonso Cuaron (too many). Villneuve is by far ahead if everyone. Amy Adams is so perfectly cast in her role, also. In fact, Villneuve wouldn't make the film without her; he insisted that she get the part. Luckily fir the studio and producers, she was available. I dont want to reveal anymore than I already have (such is not too much). Also, Villeneuve's favorite conductor, Johanne Johansson has a stunning score, as well. Enjoy; on many levels, too.",10,0,2,8 March 2019
The Shawshank Redemption," An Incredibly Overated Film
","This is why I have a problem with IMDB. They rated this film as the #1film of all time. Are you kidding me? It wouldn't make it into my top 50. Why? Because they are like the 'Peoples Choice Awards'. How about 'Citizen Kane', 'Lawrence of Arabia', 'The Wizard of Oz', or any film Stanley Kubrick made from 'The Killing' (1956) forward. They are all an order of brilliance above this film. Yes, it is entertaining and good, but I can't stand a monologue that is simply repeats what has already been shown on the screen. It is ridiculous to do that. Why? Because Morgan Freeman is simply a narrator for what you are watching on the screen, like a football play by play announcer. Very overrated. I gave it an 8 when it really deserved a 7 (at best). The people at IMDB think a comic book film is great. What are they; pre-teens?",8,2,4,30 March 2019
Marriage Story," Unfortunately, Overrated
","Unfortunately, I had read 2 reviews of this film before seeing it. I do my best to avoid (and usually succeed) in avoiding previews. I did so with 'Marriage Story'. I always want to be surprised. For this film, this was nearly unavoidable. The studio was almost always shoving the film down my throat. Even if they hadn't done this, I had some expectations given the cast and crew. I am a big fan of Ms Johansson, and for a long time. She has very potent acting skills. Regardless, I was drawn into the story from the start of the film. The characters are very believable. Sadly, the script devolves into blandness. This is not the fault of the actors. After about 40 minutes, I simply did not care what would happen next. Overall, I found it forgettable. Better luck next time.",5,0,0,27 June 2020
Mother!," Gratuitous to the nth degree
","If this is a 'genius' director, we are doomed. This is one the most gratuitously grotesque films I have ever watched. It is not original, not clever, and most of all, not entertaining whatsoever. As good as some of Darren Aronovsky's films have been, this one is the exact opposite. Any comic book film is better than this trash. Its completely iver the top for no reason. Skip it, folks.",2,2,5,30 October 2018
Life," Alien Ripoff
","I liked it, and it is worth seeing.However, this is yet another ripoff of the brilliant, ground breaking film 'Alien' (1979). Yes, there are numerous differences, but many more similarities. The prime directive of the film is the same: A total survivor that will do anything to live. The ending, although done in a quite cagey manner, was entirely predictable; especially if you are familiar with Daniel Espinoza. He is still an excellent director, but I thought he was out of his realm on this film. That said, I believe he can and will improve as a director. I liked his film 'Safe House'; it was much better. Lastly, there is a rumor of a prequel named 'Venom' to be released next year (2018).",6,0,1,22 June 2017
Contact," Grows With Age
","Like Stanley Kubrick and the 13 feature length films he made, this grows with time. Robert Zemeckis did a wonderful job with Carl Sagan's book. A must see keeper. John Hurt & Tom Skerritt were both in 'Alien' (1979), just as Jodie Foster & William Fichtner were in 'Elysium'. Lastly, David Morse is in this in a rare role as the protagonist. A great film which belongs in everyone's collection.",9,0,0,6 February 2020
Alien: Covenant," Bad and getting worse
","I am a huge fan of the original 'Alien' film (1979). My sister had called me and said, 'see this film'. We used to do this whenever one of us really liked a film. The only rule was to not reveal anything. So, I had no idea what I was in for. Besides her call to me, I had not read anything or even seen a preview prior to going to this movie. For all I knew, it was about illegal aliens. coming over our (US) border. I also remember it opened (in my city) the same weekend as 'Moonraker', a Roger Moore James Bond film. There were a dozen people at our apartment that Friday night. They all wanted to see James Bond. I did not, so I took one guy with me. It blew my mind. People not only screamed, but ran out of the theater. My friend with me was speechless afterwards. It was the best film I had seen since 'The Exorcist' (1973). BTW, those are the 2 most terrifying films I have ever seen, to this day. As I do when a new film I really liked came out back then, I went to see it 3 days in a row; taking everyone I knew. It is still one of my 2 or 3 favorite films. I have seen it at least 50 times since then; maybe more. I have seen all the sequels many, many times as well. I truly liked 'Prometheus'. I thought it was very good, and made a lot of sense. Having seen 'Alien: Covenant' at the theater and on Bluray, I am sad to say they have really taken steps backwards; I mean big steps, in several areas. As far as the casting, besides Fassbender, who is in probably half of the film, no one comes close to him in 'Covenant'. I like Billy Crudup, and Katherine Waterston; however, they are not near as good as the leads in 'Prometheus'. I don't care if Ms. Waterston is 6' tall; Noomi Rapace blew her away, on all counts, and you cannot even begin to compare her to Sigourney Weaver. No way. Billy Crudup is a very, very good actor; truly. However, he seems like a fish out of water in this role. In the extras on the disc, they spend almost all of the time talking about how much it is going to scare the hell out of the audience. I am sorry, it does not work. Carmen Ejogo and the rest of the cast doesn't compare with Charlize Theron, Guy Pearce, Idris Elba, Kate Dickie, and on and on. Actor for actor, they just don't stack up...Danny McBride-are you kidding? He is not funny, and he can't act. Regarding the plot, I understood it all as soon as 'David' appeared. There were no surprises. I don't know what is going on with Ridley Scott, but he is so much better building incredible sets (where was Arthur Max?). I think all of this is starting to go to Scott's head, like in a bad way. I absolutely knew everything which was going to happen, as soon as they played the Prologue (which I liked). I am not talking about details; I am talking about the primary parts. Then 'Orum' (Billy Crudup) is playing a fool, and I get it; he is supposed to, but this is my exact problem: I was not surprised in a single scene; not one. There far too many 'homages' made. In fact, that is all this film seems to be; a tip of the hat to '2001', Alien', 'Blade Runner', and 'Prometheus'.Ridley Scott is truly one of the best directors out there; for a while I think he was the best left after Stanley Kubrick died, and there is a large gap between the two. I do not feel that way anymore. Scott is getting passed by better directors. I liked 'Arrival' (2016) so much more than anything Ridley Scott has directed or produced in the past decade at least. That includes 'Blade Runner 2049'. Both were directed by Ridley's friend, Denis Villeneuve. I think the torch has been pased to him. My favorite films will always be Stanley Kubrick's. He is in a class of his own. I would have loved to have seen Fassbender directed by Kubrick; it was not to be.",7,0,2,31 August 2017
