United 93," nice story
","I watched it and I watched 'Loose Change 2' which btw. is not even included in IMDb.com when they catalog every other bad or irrelevant movie whatsoever. I*d love to hear some response from IMDb on that topic?!The directing is OK, they cast is a bunch of unknown not that talented actors. But it sure is a patriotic movie and if you like drama supported propaganda you should definitely watch this one. A story doesn't become more true because it is told more often.I still give it 4 stars because it was a good fun catastrophe movie to watch. It might even turn out to be a milestone in trash movie history when some day another version of the 'real story' pops up.check out HTTP://www.rynearson.com/ and come back again with another view on this movie.",4,5,22,5 May 2006
