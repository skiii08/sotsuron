Lucky Number Slevin," Imitation Tarantino movie!
","Imitation Tarantino movie!Within a few minutes of watching this flick, it's clear that the cast and crew are impersonating a certain type of Tarantino film.The forced 'chemistry' between Hartnett and Liu is embarrassing to watch. The smart-Alec dialog comes off as high-school kids muttering 'I know you are but what am I?' repeatedly and not much of it is funny, clever or even pertinent to what's going on in the movie.The convoluted story tries so hard to trip up the viewer it stumbles over itself in the process. The stupid names are enough to tell you that this is gonna be a stinker... The Rabbi? FFS! You can get away with these cartoon villains in a Batman movie, maybe but here they just look and sound ridiculous.Here's an example of the dialog...Does he owe you 94,000 dollars? I don't know. Does he owe me 94,000 dollars? Do I owe him 94,000 dollars? Yes, you owe him 94,000 dollars? Do I owe you 94,000 dollars? You owe him 94,000 dollars, so you owe me 94,000 dollars. So, I owe you 94,000 dollars? Yes, you owe me 94,000 dollars.This goes on for a while, so you can get up and make a sandwich or something when it starts. In fact, you'll have time to drive out to a Subway and order a sandwich and still make it back in time for your life to re-boot!A bloody awful mess in every way possible.",2,2,6,8 April 2017
Passengers," A spoof, right?
","A spoof, right? (Three stars for Jen's bodacious bod! Yummy!)This was either a clever movie that pays homage to the sexist rubbish played out in the SciFi movies of the 50s... in which case it was OK, or it was a serious attempt at re-writing Sleeping Beauty in a spaceship... in which case it's horrible!Also - there's too much running around in corridors (thanks, Doctor Who!) and keeping fit, (thanks, Jane Fonda!)If there's no feasible story or likable characters then pile on the computer generated effects, right? They always save the day and put a lid on pretty much all the plot holes and other narrative nastiness. After all; it works for Star Wars and Star Trek! Make it flashy and noisy and they will come! Nothing else matters.Jennifer Lawrence is lovely to look at and that's what kept me going through this celluloid crime. But listening to her gab on about writing a book made me want to slap her.The last twenty minutes are about as detestable as movies can get. I just can't conjure up the bad memories long enough to write about it, they are so deep and painful!My take, when I walked out into the clean air of the theater, was that Hollywood seems to hate SciFi even more than it hates Republicans!",3,5,11,13 January 2017
Bird Box," Why on earth is this garbage even being talked about?
","Within the first couple of minutes there's a flashback to five years earlier. Audiences just love flash backs, don't they? Oh, wait... they DON'T like flashbacks. Only the self-indulgent, morons who make TV and movies like annoying flashbacks... so we must endure these tiresome vehicles.There's something on the planet which is causing everyone to commit suicide. In this movie, it seems that the worldwide threat of mass suicide causes the entire population to run out into the streets and drive the first car they can find, first!The reliance on stock footage of European street protests is just ridiculous.Finally (and this is where I bowed out of this abomination) the ad-libbed dialogue between the two sisters and even the hospital nurse is so painful to watch, you'll want to put razor blades in your ears.I gave this mess a full fifteen minutes of my life. Don't do the same. Don't be me!",2,5,9,1 January 2019
The Revenant," Edit it down to an hour!
","Relentlessly boring yarn about the implausible recovery of a chap attacked by a wolf.Nice photography but even this feature quickly wears out it's welcome after the first few days! (Well, that's what it feels like.)The cookie cutter bad guys, innocent guys, honorable guys all pop in and out of the scenery...but it's not enough to save this long, long sleep-fest.Add to that the fact that the entire premise is so preposterous, then it just makes the whole movie experience a drain on your patience.On the upside, if you like snow, then maybe you can get through it. There's loads of snow.",2,6,12,11 March 2016
The Secret Life of Walter Mitty," Dull as dishwater.
","How is this movie getting so many adoring reviews? It's just an exasperating and uneventful two hour long waste of life. The title is stolen from an excellent short story that most British kids read when they're young. The film has no relationship with that story whatsoever.Nothing makes sense and the insane decisions Mitty makes defy any sense of logic. I think Ben Stiller is one of those actors that only Americans 'get'. All his movies are completely lost on me.If you like Stiller, you'll like this. If his humor is as baffling to you as it is to me, you're in for another disappointment.",2,2,11,4 February 2019
