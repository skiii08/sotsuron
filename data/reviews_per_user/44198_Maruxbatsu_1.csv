Sucker Punch," So I just finished watching this on HBO
","I'll say this first, as someone who majored in game and animation, the graphics were great, but I honestly couldn't stand watching the fight scenes. I really was bored and I would start doing other things as the fight scenes went on and on and on. As great as the graphics were in those scenes, they just seemed so random and irrelevant to the story. The dragons were awesome, but why use dragons? Each scene didn't mesh well into the next. I had no idea whatsoever about what this movie was about, so I had no expectations prior to watching it. It was interesting to a point and I know they were definitely trying to do something different with the story and concept, but so many things were just lacking to pull it all together to really make it a good film. I mean you can't add a bunch of random awesome stuff that would be perfectly fine individually, the key word here is individually, and expect them to come together to make sense when jam packed into one story. 'Cause it wont. Ohhh man, it wont.TIP: If you want to take away some useful knowledge after reading my review, here's a suggestion - if you seek a REALLY great mental asylum lobotomy prostitute fantasy world story, I have one title for you. American McGee's Alice. It is based on Lewis Carroll's Alice in Wonderland, except it is very twisted. Look up the summary on the Alice wikia and maybe play the games because you will get so much more than the story in this movie. The alternate reality in the games actually co-relates to the story and have profound metaphors, *spoilers ahead from the game American McGee's Alice: Madness Returns* ...ie: the master villain 'Dollmaker' producing and selling dolls that keep appearing throughout her alternate world - little kids getting their heads drilled and being sold off as nothing more than blank 'toys' to creeps in reality. You end up having to fight only his 'hands' in the end because they were what he used to defile kids. There really wasn't much thought behind choosing the fight scenes in Sucker Punch - they were random. Yes the movie has its metaphors, but they were weak. If you think otherwise and say Sucker Punch is complex, etc, I challenge you to at least play American McGee's Alice: Madness Returns. After you do that, re-think the word complex and how you've been using it up until now. I shouldn't even be comparing the two since they are on totally different levels. The stories aren't the same, but there are similar concepts between them, just enough so that it makes me want others to read about it/play it rather than watch Sucker Punch. I know there is a difference between a game and a movie, but even if you shorten the game up, it'll still be way more creative and deep. Whenever they get back to producing American McGee's Alice into a movie, I'll be all over that. Instantly.",3,0,6,24 August 2012
