Requiem for a Dream," A wake up call, everyone needed.
","Best movie I've ever seen. Honestly. Next to Fight Club, this movie is #1. I can't get over how the director makes you want to baul, yet scream at Sara for being naive, or Tell Marion that Harry won't make it home, and how it'll be their last time to see each other. I recently finished the book, which was fantastic. The movie has such emotion, I ended up crying for about a half hour when it was all done (I'm a chick :P ) This definitely has turned me away to drugs, it's such a scare factor, yet it's so real. This happens every day to people. If you haven't seen it yet, GO SEE IT!!! I own it, and I've seen it about 20 times. Jared Leto gives an awesome performance, but not as great as Ellen Burstyn. Marlon Waynes did a wonderful job a very serious movie, since he's usually in comedys.",Null,0,1,28 October 2004
