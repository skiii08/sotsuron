Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Don't waste your money, 'You won't like!!!!!!!'
","Awful is too kind. Walked out 10 minutes before the end. The first movie I have ever walked out of in my life. I was with a big 'Ali Gee' fan and he wanted to leave before me. This movie is more of an attack on the common American that shows patients and courtesy to a person from a foreign nation. If picking on the elderly and exploiting Americas middle class from the heartland of this country is your idea of humor, you will be pleased. If insult and making fun of elderly Jews is your idea of humor, you will be pleased. If your idea of humor takes a little thought and or wit, or even a plot for that matter, you'll want your money back. Very sad!",1,5,11,10 December 2006
