The Blair Witch Project," What's the Big Deal?
","There was so much hype about this movie, and I found it sadly lacking.  As a matter of fact everyone in the theatre left saying 'that's it?'  The movie was well acted, and the actors appeared suitably freaked out by what was going on.  But the 'camera work' made it almost impossible to get into the movie.  Instead of feeling scared with the characters I was laughing (with most everyone else) at them.And don't look for a satisfying ending.  Without giving it away, all I can say is that it is really the only ending that fits the style and story. But it is also very unfulfilling, and instead of salvaging a very long drawn out psycho-drama (it really wasn't scary) it left the movie on a flat note.",2,1,4,18 July 1999
Miracle," Great event, good movie
","A great movie has to be great in a number of ways, great plot, great acting, great directing, etc.  This movie definitely had a great plot that will resonate with US audiences.  The rest of the movie however was only good to so-so.  None of the acting performances particularly stuck out as being outstanding, but none of them were bad either.Basically this movie just tells the story event by event, unfortunately this means that a lot of the characters fall by the wayside.  For instance, when the final cut was made it was hard to feel bad about it because the player/character wasn't well developed.All that being said this is a good movie overall.  The story is the classic scrappy little guy beats the big bad guy which is a story that is hard to have fail.  It is even harder to mess up when it is a true story.  Enjoy it for the feel good type movie that it is, but don't expect a miracle (except in the game of course).",5,0,3,8 February 2004
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Annoying FX!
","I really wish I could say a lot of good things about this movie but I really can't.  This movie is a Saturday morning children's TV version of a real Star Wars movie.The FX actually detracted from the story instead of adding to it. Everything was too clean, too in focus.  The background is supposed to be in the background (out of focus) so it doesn't detract from what is going on. Also there is a certain amount of charm in having a guy in a suit rather than a completely computer generated being.Also I am annoyed that Natalie Portman was made to redub her lines because it definitely shows at some points.  And they must have had her do some of the dubbing in a city street it was so garbled.Also the alien races were crude racial stereotypes.  The movie was too busy making fun of everything it could to be gritty like the original Star Wars.I am not saying that it isn't worth seeing, but this movie will really appeal mostly to young children, and not to older 'children'.",6,1,2,20 May 1999
Meet the Parents," Tried too hard
","While I found Meet the Parents to be an overall enjoyable experience, I didn't think it was a great movie.  The movie tried too hard to include as many gags as possible, forsaking believability in return for a few forced laughs.  If it had been toned down a little bit it would have been much more enjoyable.Actually in many regards it has the same foibles as Something about Mary. There premise is good, but too many of the jokes rely on everything that can happen does happen.",4,1,1,10 October 2000
Fury," Clichéd War porn
","There is an ongoing trend in movies about World War II to be 'gritty', in other words showing as many body parts flying as possible. Be it a leg amputated by machine gun, or a head vaporizing from a shell. While perhaps it is 'realistic', it isn't necessary, and hides the fact that this movie is a string of clichés, with a few trite expressions thrown in to make Brad Pitt seem Oscar worthy.The most obvious cliché is the innocent kid getting thrown into the war and seeing how gruesome war is. He tries to maintain his ideals in the brutal face of war. Everyone else is already hardened and cynical and on the brink of being animals. The spoiler here is obvious, the innocent boy starts enjoying killing Nazis. The turn is actually terribly done, since basically he ends up killing some Germans and suddenly likes it. Just like that.Aside from the clichés and gore, it isn't badly done for a war movie. I have to sat Shia Lebeouf probably does the best acting of his career and probably does the best acting of any of the main characters.",6,8,19,20 October 2014
Inglourious Basterds," Inglorious is Right
","It would be unfair to say this movie didn't have its moments, but overall I found Inglorious Basterds to be sub-par. The first half of the movie was fun, clever dialog, interesting story, great characters. The second half of the movie just fell apart.Overall, it is clear that Tarantino is a fan of movies, since this film is an homage to a number of them. Once upon a time in the West features prominently. There are also a number of Wilhelm screams. The problem is: splicing together a bunch of good/great movies doesn't make a good movie in return.Overall the acting of the main players was quite enjoyable. Brad Pitt, Diane Kruger, Daniel Bruhl, and Christoph Waltz deserve mention. Although towards the end when the film overall went to pieces the over the top acting got a bit ridiculous.For someone trying to decide whether to see this movie, I would offer the following. The movie is two and a half hours, so be prepared for that. There are a number of rather gruesome scenes (maybe not quite Reservoir dogs intense, but the right ballpark). It is definitely a Quentin Tarantino movie.",5,11,25,21 August 2009
The Others," Not that big a surprise
","Contrary to the advertising for this movie, the ending is not as big a surprise as they would have you believe.  I won't give away the ending, but suffice to say that with the plethora of 'misleading' movies out there today it isn't hard to figure out what is going on.The whole of the movie is dimly lit and overly spooky.  The movie is set in a large manor house with curtains on all the windows to protect the children from the sunlight (they are photo-sensitive).  A constant supply of fog, austere costumes and actors who could sit for American Gothic complete the setting.  Frankly, by the time the real intense part of the movie started I was already inured to the setting.  And that was one of the great failures of the movie.  Trying to keep the audience on the edge of their seats the entire movie is a losing proposition.  Although there were a few jump scenes that broke through and caused a few yells in the audience.Overall the movie was fair, nothing too memorable, but probably worth seeing if you are into the suspense genre, or are a fan of Nicole Kidman.  Somehow she seems way too at home in these period pieces.  I gave it 7/10.",6,0,0,12 August 2001
Troy," Slightly better than the critics say
","The biggest problem that most critics have with this movie is the casting of the male lead characters.  I totally agree as far as Achilles (Brad Pitt) is concerned.  Brad Pitt just doesn't have the presence or acting talent to pull off this role.  Emotional turmoil looks like constipation and his speeches just don't have impact.Eric Bana and Orlando Bloom were actually good choices for the brothers Hector and Paris, they even looked like they could be brothers.  Bana plays the strong, noble relatively quiet type, and Orlando plays the smarmy pretty boy.  I just wish someone had taught Orlando to shave the joke of a mustache.  I am sure it was supposed to make him look like a young man trying to be a full grown man, but it just looked silly and was distracting.One big problem I had with this movie is the exaggeration of the numbers. They could have saved a ton of money on CGI by actually showing only 50K greeks and 20-30K trojan soldiers.  Instead they had to carpet the hills with fake soldiers, closer to 500K than 50K.  Also, although the large battle scenes were well done, it came across as the great toothpick battle. Personally, I would like to see a battle scene that shows some sort of tactic other than my army charges your army.  I suppose the Myrmidons forming an armadillo counts, but that was very brief and more of a skirmish.Other than that the movie is about as expected.  A bit too much of the sappy dialog and speeches, but there is no getting away from that in today's hollywood.",5,1,3,15 May 2004
The Day After Tomorrow," Throw science and avoiding cliche out the window
","The movie opened up with what is quickly becoming the most cliched movie opening, the camera flying over the water.  That is far from the only cinematic cliche that this movie had the poor judgment to use.  Another memorable one is when Sam can't open a door, so he decides to climb out on some pipes to smash in the window with an axe rather than just using the axe on the door.  Or how about the cliched street person who is the only one who knows whats going on?  The list really goes on and on.  If it isn't cliched it is CGI filler.On top of all the cinematic cliches there is the simple fact that the science isn't even close to reflecting reality.  Sure in the grand scheme of things over decades polar ice melting could upset the Atlantic circulation. It wouldn't happen in a week.  According to the makers of the film it was condensed from dramatic effect, but it could all really happen.  First off, tornadoes in LA, but not in places like Oklahoma?  Freezing to death in seconds?  Frost chasing people down the hall?  The water in New York harbor rising 200+ ft to surround the statue of liberty (that the statue was even standing is pretty silly, but I willingly chalk that up to dramatic license), but not high enough to drown everyone in the library?Then to make it all worse the movie closes with an incredibly preachy speech.  Sorry, it opened with some incredibly preachy stuff.  Oh, and there was a bunch of preachy stuff in the middle.  And that doesn't include the 'I've been a bad father' reflections.The only good thing that can be said about the movie is that the acting wasn't bad.  Sure there were some annoyances, but you expect that even from good disaster movies.  But all in all the acting was pretty decent.  Of course, it could just be that the rest of the movie was so bad it was almost funny.",3,0,1,29 May 2004
Sleepy Hollow," Ghoulish movie
","This was a well done movie, and quite gripping.  Definately the best movie from the horror genre this year.  And Johnny Depp even does a convincing job acting, although his support cast, especially Ricci, was not as good.One nice touch was that, although there were many special effects they did not stick out as they normally seem to in such movies.  This is probably because even the scenes that were 'real' had a skewed reality.  And for once the reality was consistent throughout the film, so the suspension of disbelief was not difficult.I do have two complaints, neither of which detract from the movie itself. The first is that this is not an authentic retelling of The Legend of Sleepy Hollow.  Amoung other things Icabod Crane was supposed to be a school teacher, and a firm believer in the occult (and it actually gets worse from there)...  But if you haven't read the story you won't miss it (much like if you never read Dracula before seeing Bram Stoker's Dracula).  The second complaint is the use of Christopher Walken.  I was hoping for some of the Walken scenes that his fans (including myself) have grown to cherish.  But aside from that he makes a truly sinister Hessian.",6,0,0,20 November 1999
Cast Away," Without the Stars would anyone see this?
",While watching this movie I was reminded of something I had seen on TV about how Castaway could not have succeeded if it weren't for a big name actor in the lead.  And that is what the result of the movie was.There are a couple of major flaws in the movie as I see it.  First of all there was not enough character developement.  You would think a movie about a guy stranded on an Island with nothing but a volleyball for company would be heavy on the character.  For the most part that isn't true.  We see a couple of sudden jumps rather than a gradual changes.  And suddenly it is four years later?  I think that this is one case when a movie should have been much longer.  The island could have been extended at least half an hour and made the movie a better effort.,5,0,1,13 January 2001
The Patriot," Best Action/Adventure Movie of the Year
","Move over gladiator, The Patriot is the best action movie for 2000.  And being movie based on the War of Independence makes it all the more stirring for Americans.  I have read that it is not historically accurate except in the broadest sense (We won the British went home).  But that is okay. Private Ryan was fictional as well, no one complained about that.Also the critics say that the person Mel Gibson's character was based on was a cruel savage beast of a man.  Well Mel Gibson's character is very savage, although he has been PC'ed a bit to make it more appealing.Those minor points aside this is an awesome movie.  The battle scenes are frighteningly real.  Brutal and graphic.  And the acting in those scenes was amazing.  The sense of fear at standing on the front line was incredibly palpable, as well as the resolution to stand ground.If you only see one movie, and aren't afraid of graphic battle scenes, you must see this movie.",6,1,1,30 June 2000
Dunkirk," War movie done right
","I really enjoyed Dunkirk, and as I walked out of the theater, I reflected on a number of things that were done right in the movie. Yes, there were some inaccuracies and some things that could have been handled better, but there was a lot to impress. The main thing that impressed me was that the movie was told entirely from the characters' points of view. Things that happen elsewhere, aren't shown. But also things that the characters can't see, also aren't shown.One of the first scenes has one of the leads walking through a deserted Dunkirk with some fellow soldiers. Shots are fired, and it's suddenly a mad dash to try to get to safety. He never looks back, and the camera thus doesn't show the German's shooting at him, just the obstacles he has to climb over to get to safety.{Minor Spoiler ahead} Relatively early in the movie there is a dog fight between three British Spitfires and a number of German planes. After the action, they are doing a radio check, and only then do they realize that the group leader is missing. The crash isn't show since they were to busy with their own dog-fight to see what happened.Where the Germans start bombing the beach, the soldiers all watch the planes approach, but at some point they take cover. Thus they never see the bombs drop from the planes, just the resulting explosions.{possible spoiler} I also appreciated that the movie didn't end with 5 minutes of crawling text to tell me what happened. Fortunately I knew how many people got off the beach, because they made a point to work it into the dialog. I also knew about the reaction in England (and Churchill's speech), not because they worked a radio broadcast in, but because a solider read it out loud from a newspaper.The movie also was able to emphasize how desperate the soldiers were to get off the beach, but at the same time there was a sense of discipline. The sense of doom was so palpable that when the civilian craft showed up at the beach, I nearly teared up.A few other things portrayed/related well: shell-shocked soldier, civilians dealing with losses of friends/family, {spoiler} that some were captured by the Germans, that the soldiers were apprehensive about how their country would respond to the defeat. My wife was very happy to see that there were women on board the civilian boats that came to the rescue, since that was true to the history. She was also happy that it was not a gore fest. Yes, there were plenty of deaths, but unlike most recent war movies, it doesn't show blood and body parts exploding everywhere.Dunkirk is a very well done movie, and if you are even moderately inclined to see it, I would recommend you do.",9,3,10,24 July 2017
Resident Evil," Incredibly tense movie
","First of all, I want to say that I have never played resident evil or even seen it played, so I have no idea about accuracy to the game, etc.  That being said I will review it as a movie only.This movie is incredibly tense.  Throughout the entire movie I kept waiting for the next jolt/scare, knowing it was coming and still getting startled. The plot proved vaguely interesting, but was largely lost in the carnage. And of course since this is a sci-fi horror the ending left open the possibility of Resident Evil 2.The acting was on par for a horror scifi movie.  Basically the cast was Michelle Rodriguez, Milla Jovovitch and a bunch of guys no one cares about except that they (in some cases) advance the plot.  Milla did a fine job playing the beautiful but tough security agent with amnesia and something to hide.  Michelle played a thug, an annoying thug (as per her usual endeavors).  Both actresses have their pseudo-trademark scenes.  For Milla this means being nearly naked except for, to quote James Bond, A nice nothing she is almost wearing.  For Michelle it is the sweaty hair in the face snarl look.All in all it was better than most game turned movies and about on the same level with other movies of the genre.",4,0,0,15 March 2002
Man on the Moon," Huhn?
","I am not saying huhn, because this biographical film didn't explain Andy Kaufman, I am saying huhn, because it wasn't a good film, and I have no idea why people say it is any good.Watching this movie, it was unclear why anyone would find Andy Kaufman funny.  He is portrayed as an egocentric, meglomaniac with delusions of grandeur.  Devito's line 'Who are you trying to entertain, yourself or the audience' was how I saw the whole movie.  Maybe it is funny or charming to the people who followed his career closely, but I thought what a waste.Except for about 30 seconds total, this movie wasn't funny.  Except for about 30 seconds total, this movie wasn't dramatic.",2,2,3,5 January 2000
2012," It's a disaster movie alright
","I used to love watching disaster movies. They were all about the struggle to survive and making hard decisions. Now, they all seem to be about preaching morality, while shoehorning in a love story.This movie in particular manages to have just about every disaster movie cliché in the book. They even hijacked a few clichés from other genres. Sprinkle in an unusually heavy dose of Deus Ex Machina and you have this movie.This is a partial list (some items are 'spoilers'):<ul><li>Noble scientist who brings the problem to the attention of the government and serves as the moral guide, Check</li></ul><ul><li>Sleazy politician who makes the unpopular cold blooded decisions, check</li></ul><ul><li>Divorced everyman who tries to connect with his children, even though they seem to like their stepfather (who is more successful) more, check </li></ul><ul><li>Noble scientist who dies, but not before revealing a key piece of information, check </li></ul><ul><li>Noble scientist love interest, check </li></ul><ul><li>Sleazy rich man who tried to buy his way out of disaster, check </li></ul><ul><li>Black president (seems to happen quite often in disaster movie for some reason), check </li></ul><ul><li>Preachy monologue about keeping our humanity followed by a bold move to save people at the risk of other people, check </li></ul><ul><li>Conspiracy nut job who ends up being right, check</li></ul><ul><li>Nutjob finding the best place to watch the end/disaster and dying, check </li></ul><ul><li>Aircraft carrier being carried on giant wave and crushing something, check</li></ul><ul><li>Character doing something that's suicidal to save others, check </li></ul><ul><li>Character surviving a suicidal act, check </li></ul><ul><li>Saving a pet from disaster, check </li></ul><ul><li>Airlifting giraffes, check</li></ul><ul><li>Being chased by an explosion and/or cloud of smoke only to be overtaken and then suddenly burst through, check </li></ul><ul><li>Crazy disaster mitigation plan that shouldn't work but does, check </li></ul><ul><li>Critical piece of technology breaking and it can only be fixed by someone doing something suicidal, check </li></ul><ul><li>One leg of a love triangle getting killed allowing that bit of plot tension to be resolved without emotional baggage, check </li></ul><ul><li>Author who wrote a book that only sold a few hundred copies, but happens to meet someone who actually read the book, check </li></ul><ul><li>A child making an observation/comment that reveals the moral lesson, check </li></ul><ul><li>Character having a slightly unusual name that ends up foreshadowing future events, check </li></ul><ul><li>Bad science, check plus plus plus plus plus plus </li></ul><ul><li>Deus ex Machina, check plus</li></ul>Anyway, if you have a high tolerance for such things, then you will probably enjoy the movie.

Shrek 2," Not quite as good as the original
","I have heard a lot of reviews that say this movie is better than the first. I have to disagree.  Shrek II tried just a little too hard to be as funny as the original and didn't quite make it.Overall, the movie was very enjoyable.  Of course, I felt like I was the only one who got some of the jokes (and I am sure I missed some).  As a sign of the subtlety of some of the jokes in this movie, the love potion has the roman numerals 'IX' on the bottle.  Of course, there are also plenty of obvious jokes (fart jokes, slapstick comedy, etc.).  Overall there is comedy appeal for everyone.If you enjoyed Shrek, chances are you will enjoy Shrek II just as much.  If you didn't like Shrek, then you won't like this one.",7,0,0,20 May 2004
Mission: Impossible II," Not bad at all
","I have been hearing bad reviews for this movie, but it really isn't bad. Sure there is not a lot of plot depth or excessive character development. But this is an action movie, where it works best if the bad guys are bad, the love interest is hot, and the good guys win.  Just one gripe though... why the stupid flip kicks?  All the time flip kicks.  Although there was some really good hand-to-hand scenes (almost ruined by the stupid flip kicks).",5,0,0,25 May 2000
"Hail, Caesar!"," Definitely a Coen brothers picture...
","There are people who love the Coen Brothers, people who hate them and people, like me, who are ambivalent. For a frame of reference, I enjoyed Hudsucker Proxy and Oh Brother Where Art Thou, but couldn't get into Big Lebowski, and could take or leave Fargo, and No Country for old men and True Grit left me a bit flat. So now that a baseline is established...Like many of the Coen brothers movies, this featured characters who were over the top to the point of being caricatures. The cinematography was superb and the dialog was clever and delivered well. I have to say the actors did tremendous jobs with their over the top characters. I also enjoyed the sense of nostalgia, for the seedy tabloid days of Hollywood, where the studios control the image of the actors as much as they control what happens on the screen.The problem I had with the movie was that it was a collection of amusing scenes that didn't pile together to create a good movie. They spent so much time making fun of everything (religion, actors, directors, etc) that the satire wore thin and became stilted. At times the caricatures also devolved into stereotyping.I wouldn't recommend this to people, but I wouldn't say it's a total waste. I know there were Coen brother fans in the theater for the sneak preview who seemed excited to talk about the movie after (mostly with comments about mainstream movie goers), so there are definitely people who this would appeal to. But for me, I thought there was enough good stuff to merit an above average rating, but that's it.",5,12,43,3 February 2016
Kong: Skull Island," Should be John C Reilly Island
","I just saw a sneak preview of Kong: Skull Island. I don't think this will be a long remembered monster movie. It's a fun movie, but ultimately forgettable. The CGI Kong, Samuel L Jackson, and John Goodman all took a backseat to John C. Rielly, who did a superb job playing a WWII pilot who was shot down and landed on Skull Island. Seriously, his role is the greatest thing in this movie.The movie is set in 1973, and the premise is that LandSat (land mapping satellite) has taken pictures of an elusive island (Skull Island) that has been rumored to exist, but not proved. John Goodman convinces the government to launch an expedition to explore the island. They take some soldiers who were pulling out of Vietnam, and are headed by Samuel L Jackson. They also pick up a British ex-special forces 'tracker' (Tom Hiddleston) and an 'anti-war' photographer played by Brie Larson.They start the mission by dropping bombs on the island to map the bedrock, ostensibly to look for mineral deposits. That's when Kong shows up to smack the helicopters out of the air, and generally wreak mayhem on the team. The scattered survivors then have to survive on an island filled with monsters and get to the extraction zone. One group finds John C. Reilly's character, who has been stranded on the island for 29+ years.That's about all I'll say about the story, so as to avoid serious spoilers. The story line is fairly conventional with very little arc to the characters. In many regards it actually sets up more like a horror movie than action/adventure movie. In fact, there are numerous jump-scares and other horror movie devices throughout the movie.In many ways, it felt like the movie couldn't quite decide what it wanted to be. Is it a monster movie? A horror movie? An action movie (anti-war)? There are also numerous characters who seem like they were intended to play more significant roles. For instance they bring along a biologist, played by Tian Jing, who does no biology and seems to mainly appear to allow another character to give exposition. Similarly most of the LandSat team, who seem to be around for comic relief (horror movie style comic relief). Even some of the major characters do little aside from provide a single plot piece.Then there is Kong. I think they could have spent a bit more time developing Kong, partly as a character and partly as an animation. The CGI was pretty good, but his proportions looked wrong and his motions were wooden.Anyway, I think there was just too much going on, and not enough time for this movie to be really good. I think it could have been an excellent mini-series, or TV season. As it is, it's an okay movie, that is fun if you go in with a low-bar. 6/10, so I enjoyed it, but not enough.",7,44,90,2 March 2017
Signs," Tense and thrilling, but a bit weak at the end
","This is another remarkable work by M. Night Shyamalan, at least until the ending.  The ending wasn't bad, but it lacked the uncertainty that marked his other works.  As the end of the movie rolled around there was a point when everything became very obvious and even felt a bit contrived.  Of course that was sort of the point but it was still too heavy handed.The movie as a whole was very beautifully done.  The style is completely Shyamalan, who seems to pay extraordinary attention to the visual details. The effect is somewhat diminished by the funny looking aliens...  Although I think men in costume are better than the inevitably fake look of CGI.There was also a small problem with the casting.  Mel Gibson and Joaquin Phoenix are supposed to be brothers, but there is clearly at least 20 years of age between them.  Sure Mel looks good for his age and Joaquin was made to look old for his age, but the gap was still large enough to be confusing, especially because the chemistry feels more like father-son (or maybe uncle-nephew) than older-younger brother.  Incidentally it doesn't become clear until a third of the way through what the relationship is.  Of course they both put in good performances, on par with their best.Aside from the three minor points, too foreshadowed/clean ending, no so good aliens, and the age issue, this movie was very enjoyable.  There were moments of laughter to break the tension (too much tension is after all as bad as not enough).  The children were amazingly cute (how many Caulkin's are there anyway?).  Also it is refreshing to see a large scale problem (aliens) and how it relates to only one specific family, which incidentally prevents the movie from being too preachy.  It is about one man's choice and not saying it is globally the right choice.  I give it 8/10 with a possible upgrade to 9/10 upon further review.",6,0,2,2 August 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Good movie spoiled by being overlong
","There are some cases where a three hour movie is a good thing.  There are other times when you don't even realize a movie was three hours long. This is not one of them.  Especially when the last half-hour of the movie is extremely slow sappy wrap-ups.  At the end there were three or four points where everyone in the audience thought the movie was finally over, only to have a loud sigh fill the theater to find another wrap-up scene.  There were also numerous scenes in the middle of the movie that were of the slow dramatic variety.  That is all well and good normally, but there were too many and each was too drawn out and they helped bloat the total length (and seeming length) of the movie.Aside from that gripe, the rest of the movie overall was pretty good. The scenery was amazing, and for the most part the visual appeal was very good. The ogres and orcs and trolls were even more ugly than before and the battle scenes were on an epic scale.  The acting was pretty good, outside of the dramatic speeches.  There are some actors who should not be allowed to make troop rallying speeches and they all had such speeches in this movie.",6,0,1,18 December 2003
The Replacements," A little flat
","This is a summer fluff movie.  Nothing spectacular, but not bad either.  The plot is basically identical to Major league except with football players. The movie is about the team getting along with each other so they can win some games.There were a number of things that could have been done to improve this movie.  For one, more scenes showing actual football.  Each games consists of about 4 plays concentrating almost entirely on keanu and jon favreau.  Oh and half the footage for the football games concentrated on the cheerleaders.  Especially annoying during the final game (cheerleaders, half a play, cheerleaders, other half of the play, cheeleaders, sideline scene, cheerleaders, etc).Since it is so light on the football and action, and overall not impressive wait to see this one of video.",5,0,1,13 August 2000
The Bourne Supremacy," Another movie ruined by shaky cam
","How long is it going to take Hollywood to learn that people hate the shaky cam?  Even the scenes in this movie that weren't shaky cam had that grainy focus and muted colors that seems to be all the style.  Simply put, the action sequences are impossible to see, and even many of the normal shots are annoyingly filmed.On the other hand, the story was pretty good.  Also Matt Damon does a good job playing Jason Bourne, and Joan Allen is good as his pseudo-nemesis CIA-deputy director Pam Landy.The story is that Jason Bourne is framed for a hit and the man who does the hit also tries to kill Jason.  Jason thinks it is the CIA and goes for some payback.6.5/10 (would have been much higher if I could have seen much of the movie!)",6,0,1,25 July 2004

It is enjoyable, especially the music, but not great.",5,0,1,20 April 2000
