Requiem for a Dream," Hmmmmm...
","Well, I just watched this movie on DVD twice in one day (once alone and once with someone else) and I'm still not really sure how I feel about it.  Deep down inside, I keep getting the feeling that this is somehow a really great movie, but I can't make up my mind if that feeling is only because of how different it was.First of all, I agree with everyone who said that this film should be shown to high school kids to deter them from ever doing drugs.  I must say that if ever, for even a moment, I would consider shooting up, I would just have to think of Harry's arm at the end of the movie (gross!).I have to say that the cinematography, editing, acting, and even the musical score were all excellent.  I think that Ellen Burstyn gave the performance of a lifetime.  Also, if Jennifer Connely was going to be nominated for a Best Supporting Actress award, this should have been the movie she was nominated for (rather than A Beautiful Mind). Basically, if you like f****d up movies that make you think, al a American Psycho or Memento, you should give this one a shot. Otherwise, don't waste your time and money.",Null,0,1,19 March 2002
X-Men," I got dragged to this film and ended up actually liking it!
","First of all, I must say that I am a female who is totally NOT into comics of any sort.  Therefore, when my husband talked me into going to see this movie, I was extremely skeptical.  I expected it to be another one of those movies where if you weren't on the 'inside' and hadn't read the comic books (yes, I was dragged to see 'Spawn' and I had no clue what was going on) that you would just be bored out of your mind for about 2 hours.Boy was I surprised about X-Men.  I must say that this film was written very well.  You really needn't have ever read the comics to fully understand the plot of the movie.  Sure, there were a couple of inside jokes (eg.  the yellow spandex jumpsuit reference, which I had explained to me at a later time), however, I'm sure that those were for the purpose of entertaining the comic book fans and in no way did they detract from the plot.I thought that the special effects were fabulous and that the characters were all very personable.  Also, in the character of Wolverine, just enough humor was added to make it enjoyable to watch.  Therefore, to all the females out there who are dreading the possibility of being dragged to this film - don't.  It really was pretty good!",Null,0,0,20 August 2000
American Psycho," One of the strangest movies I have ever seen
","I must say, this movie was absolutely nothing like I expected.  I rented it because my sister said that it was fabulous.  I must say that I now agree.Before I saw it I was under the impression that it would be a psychological horror flick.  I had been told that it was gory and was preparing myself to be completely grossed out.  However, I was not at all grossed out.  I thought that the murder scenes were tastefully done and left much to the imagination.  For me, that allowed me to focus more on the plot and less on just some graphic scenes. Contrary to what some reviewers have said, there is actually a plot.  We slowly follow an already disturbed man into the depths of insanity.  What is especially intriguing is the fact that he realizes that he is insane. I have to say that Christian Bales' performance is definitely oscar-worthy. Just the fact that at one moment you can think that he is a very good looking guy and then the next think that he is one of the ugliest people shows his outstanding range and understanding of the character.  I agree with many, however, that Reese Witherspoon was severely miscast in this part. She does not possess the sophistication (in looks mostly) to portray that part, no matter how small that part was. I strongly recommend this movie to anyone who would like to see a movie that stays with them and forces them to think about it for hours afterward.P.S.  To the 13 and 14 year old girls that hated it - that is the purpose of the R rating!",Null,1,2,3 October 2000
Spider-Man," Great comic-book movie!
","Alright, I'll admit it, I did NOT want to see this movie.  My husband dragged me to it.  I was afraid it would be another horrible comic-book movie that was dark and full of inside references that only devout fans of the comic would get.  However, I'm glad that he did.  It was great!I really enjoyed the fact that a lot of the movie revolved around Peter Parker's wonder and enjoyment of his new skills and also of the relationship between him and M.J.  This made it such a chick flick!  However, at the same time, there was stuff exploding and people fighting and so it was a great guy movie too.  I would definitely recommend this movie for a date.Like many of the other reviewers, I noticed that some of the special effects were not up to par with many recent films.  I commented on this to my husband who said that he thought they did that on purpose to give it more of that 'comic book' feel.  After thinking about it, I agree.  Also, many people have spoken about some of the cheesy, over-the-top dialog.  I think that this was also supposed to harken back to cheesy comic-book type dialog.All in all, it was very entertaining and interesting, and unlike many comic book-turned movies lately, you do end up caring about the characters and their feelings.",Null,0,0,10 May 2002
Rock Star," Rock On!
","I really enjoyed this movie.  I thought that it would be stupid and boring (and yes, at times, it was both), but there were enough quirks in it to make it really different and interesting.First of all, I found it immensely amusing that Chris' parents were totally into his rock 'n' roll lifestyle and it was his brother who was the wet blanket instead.  Also, I liked how Jennifer Aniston, as his girlfriend, handled the situation.  Instead of being totally immature and jealous and breaking up with him in a screaming match with accusations flying everywhere, she calmly tells him that this is his time and his dream and although she is sad that she doesn't have a bigger part in it, she is content to go do something she wants to.Also, I watched this movie on DVD and I would totally recommend this way to view it.  If you listen to the director commentary, he tells you that there are artists from Slaughter, Dokken, Third Eye Blind, and Verve Pipe among others that play the musicians (including Jason Bonham).  Therefore, these guys really contributed a lot of input as to whether the movie was realistic.  As for the guy who commented that there was no connection to Judas Priest, the director said that the studded vest, hat, and collar seen at the Steel Dragon house was a direct reference to Judas Priest.  Also, that the lead singer of Steel Dragon turned out to be gay.So, if you like rock movies I would totally recommend this one!!",Null,11,17,19 March 2002
