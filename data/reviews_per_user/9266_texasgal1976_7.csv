The Sound of Music," A Unique Love Story
","The idea of pairing an optimistic nun in training with an unyielding Captain is ingenious. That's what makes this film enjoyable to watch. . because you know the whole time that she is going to break through to him, and that underneath the intimidating facade lies a beating heart. The cute kids who join in on all the singing is just a bonus.",10,1,7,19 May 2000
Se7en," Vividly Remains In My Memory
","I saw Se7en at the theater and was glued to the screen the entire time. Maybe it was the dark and dreary atmosphere combined with great classical and jazz music. Maybe it was the performances, namely those given by Freeman and Spacey. Or perhaps it was just the gruesome subject matter and satisfying ending. Whatever it was, this film takes hold and doesn't let go, not even after you've left theater.",10,0,0,18 May 2000
Fight Club," An Overlooked Classic
","Fight Club is one of those films that I think will be appreciated more as time goes on. The story has so many twists and turns and is never boring and the outcome is even a bigger revelation than the one in The 6th Sense. From start to finish the film never slows down. It is mind-blowing and amazing and the direction and other camera tricks by Fincher is top notch. Perhaps, the most impressive thing about this flick is Ed Norton. There is one scene that Norton's character has with his boss that is Oscar-worthy. It's a shame the Academy, however, decided to ignore him this time. Brad Pitt, Helena Bonham Carter, and Meat Loaf also give noteworthy performances.",10,0,1,28 May 2000
American Beauty," Perhaps I'm In The Minority
","It amazes me how many people love this film. I'm not one of them. I did like the film, but I often wonder if American Beauty is somewhat overrated. There are times when this movie is right up there with genius, but then at other times, it just seems like a poetic mid-life crisis. I was, however, very impressed with the acting. Wes Bentley and Chris Cooper especially moved me.",8,0,0,18 May 2000
Being John Malkovich," Quirky, Original, and Fun
","Being John Malkovich, for me, was a surprisingly good film. Yes, I read the reviews, but so many films lately possess great reviews, but then when I see the flick, I just can't comprehend the praise. Not this one. This movie truly deserves the praise it has been given. This film is quirky, odd, original, which is hard to come by, unusual, strange, unnatural yet natural, bazaar, silly, exact, and in general, a pleasure. I was pleased with the direction, the acting, and most of all, the story which never ceased to amaze and always found a new door to crawl through and a new insight always lay at the other end. If you're tired of seeing mindless drivel, see Being John Malkovich, a film in which, even the title character appeared and performed well.",9,0,1,18 May 2000
Bring It On," Nothing To Cheer About
","The opening scene of this movie made me jump to the conclusion that perhaps what I was about to see was going to be smart and satirical. . .The opening scene ended up being the best scene in the film. Stereotypes prevailed and the script ended up being typical and unoriginal high school fanfare which consists of: crude humor, skin, and attractive twentysomethings pretending to be secondary students. This is not new stuff. We've seen it before in the countless number of teen flicks that have plagued us for the last few years. Except these kids wear skirts and sport pom-poms.",Null,0,0,22 August 2000
The Shawshank Redemption," My Favorite Film
","The Shawshank Redemption was a film that I was always on my way to the theater to see, but unfortunately, I got sidetracked each and every time. Critics felt that the long title kept people away, I guess I was in that category, no matter how great I heard this movie was. I finally saw the movie the day it hit videotape. To this day, it continues to dominate the number one position on my list of favorite films of all time. There is so much to love about this film. Especially the writing by Frank Darabont. This is one of the few films that does Stephen King's material justice. It's a very uplifting story, one that you can't really articulate with words. This film is about the experience. I'm proud to say that I own a copy of the movie, a copy of the screenplay, and a copy of Different Seasons, in which the original story derived. This is the one picture I recommend to people, even strangers, on a regular basis.",10,0,0,18 May 2000
