The King's Speech," 'Your highness, I am SPEECHLESS.'
","He is about to make quite possibly one of the most important moves of his career: A speech to thousands of quiet and on-the-edge-of-the-seat people at the Wembley stadium. He stands at the podium, with the speech in hand and his lovely wife by his side. He begins to open his mouth... but the words can't come out. He fights himself to get the words out, but no matter how hard he fights, Prince Albert's- soon to be King George VI- stammer gets the best of him. His wife, Queen Elizabeth, is worried for him. So what does she do? She looks in the paper and follows an ad that leads the two to failed Australian stage actor Lionel Logue, who teaches him how to do his best in the situations where his stammer gets the best of him.The King's Speech is based upon this incredible story, and is really a remarkable film in every aspect. The film, unfortunately, was slapped with an R rating from the MPAA for about 12 occurrences of the F-bomb. It's too bad the MPAA don't know how to take things into context and like to automatically slap an R rating because of one four letter word, even despite the word being used in a non-sexual context. Even young children are taught the swearing trick in speech therapy.The performances in the film are nothing short of incredible- Colin Firth has yet again proved why he is a great actor. He apparently studied stammering to get prepared for the role and I'm not surprised- his stammering was realistic. Helena Bonham Carter gives a sexy and suave performance as Queen Elizabeth, the supportive wife and woman who's at his right hand all along. Geoffrey Rush and Guy Pearce are also incredible, Rush giving a nice and comical performance as Lionel Logue and Peace playing the brother, David.I will admit I was wondering how a movie about a man who stammers could be good, and I can safely say after seeing this movie, it was done in a way it could be entertaining!!!! The therapy scenes are wicked fun and hilarious. The funniest of all being where Bertie is taught the swearing trick, where you can release your stress by unleashing a whole load of cuss words. That scene had the whole theatre laughing out loud and was definitely one of the highlights of the film. However the true highlights was the big speech near the end, where King George VI is faced with the biggest task of his career- a speech on the radio. The whole scene is intense and has you on the edge of your seat- it is every bit as suspenseful as being at a soccer game in the final few minutes and hoping your team can win. I felt like I was one of the many people listening to the speech on the radio. It was effective and you will definitely be on the edge of your seat.In short, I walked out of the theatre with a big smile on my face. It is amazing how such a small film can have a big amount of heart, and this film, I can safely say, is aw-aw-aw-awesome, and is one that should not be missed.",10,2,4,27 December 2010
The Avengers," If you don't even remotely enjoy this movie, there's 'some assembly required' on your brain
","My inner child is something I value most, and that inner child remembers my days of being a little kid and playing with my Iron Man and Captain America toys, as well as wishing I was the Incredible Hulk. I also remember watching the Hulk cartoons and begging my parents to get me the latest issue of of the next Captain America comic books. So as you can tell, I'm a comic books have played a huge role in my childhood, and that being said, it was with great excitement that I awaited The Avengers. Having seen all the Avengers movies until then and owning them all on blu-ray, I remember even watching them all up until Thursday May 3rd, which was when the midnight premiere took place. My buddy and I even wore Iron Man masks to the screening.I'm most happy to report, to say The Avengers did not disappoint is an unforgivable understatement. It may just be the best comic book movie I've ever seen. It shines dozens of lamps on The Dark Knight and it makes the previous Avengers movies (even Thor, which I loved despite not having been familiar with the Thor mythos before seeing it) look like the Fantastic Four movies. Everything about this movie was pitch perfect. Starting with the script. Joss Whedon had penned the script and it's obvious he has done his homework on not just the mythos and everything else in the world of The Avengers, but also what the audience loves about the heroes and expects from a movie about The Avengers. Everyone was given a sense of humour and played their cards right- Tony Stark was his usual lovable jerk self, and had his typical attitude problems that were hard not to love. He was given a great amount of action as well and the scene near the end where he pushes the nuclear bomb into the portal was purely beautiful intensity. Captain America was his usual kickass self, and every one of his action scenes were hard to not love. Thor was hilarious as well and his scenes with Loki were just amazing. Particularly the scene near the end on Stark tower where he forces Loki to watch the mayhem going on in the city and asks 'Is this what you want?'. Aso, FINALLY the Hulk has had justice done. He's given a sense of humour, which the other movies absolutely failed on. I'm happy to report the movie did not fail there. And who can forget the dialogue? Classic Avengers dialogs, down to the last inch. 'We need a plan of attack!' 'I have a plan. Attack.' and 'WhTs the matter, not fond of thunder and lightning?' 'I don't like what comes after.'The characterization is really what counts here too. Obviously if you're going to a movie called The Avengers for a character study you're going to the wrong movie (and you need to lay off the artsy movies too, as they're clearly doing serious stuff to your brain), but for the type of movie it is, it's done supremely well. Each character is unique in their own right- I've already mentioned the eponymous superheroes, but Black Widow is one sexy and fun character that's hard not to love. Her action scenes are just incredible and her backstory, while thankfully kept to a minimum is interesting as hell. Hawkeye is stone cold and scary in the first half when  possessed by Loki, then is cool and badass near the end when he resides to kick some Loki butt. The movie is also one of the funniest movies I've ever seen thanks to lots of clever, Whedonian humour and appropriately placed Comic book style exaggeration. The scene where Hulk smashes Loki around like a rag doll made me laugh harder than anything in 21 Jump Street and any other comedy this year. And the scene where Hulk sucker punches Thor!The performances are amazing as well. Pure commitment from all involved, with Downey Jr., Evans and Hemsworth, as well as Johannson, Smulders, Jackson, Hiddleston and Renner giving amazing performances all, but Ruffalo is the real surprise here. He brought something new to the table here as Hulk- every line he spoke sounded like he was trying hard to hold back his inner monster and boy was it chilling. His monologue about how he tried committing suicide was delivered very chillingly beautifully. He was the biggest surprise and got everything about the Hulk perfect. Props to Ruffalo for FINALLY getting The Hulk exactly right!!!I'm going to conclude my review with one more little piece of praise. Whedon is my favourite TV writer And he's managed to make me proud to be a comic book nerd. Justice was done to the best superheroes ever and I can tell superhero movies are going to not be the same ever again. A big thanks to Ll involved for the commitment and true dedication to making this movie possible, and the great success it was. I've seen this movie twice already and I can't wait to see it again and again. Now I've only got two more words to say: AVENGERS ASSEMBLE!",10,10,21,6 May 2012
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," The longest and most expensive trailer ever made
","I have a rather wishy washy relationship with The Hunger Games. I had read and watched Battle Royale before but I love the idea of people being forced into a fight to the death by the government. It's terrifying and so that's why I even read the book in the first place. Because knowing it takes place in the future, I wanted to see how Collins would interpret it and how it was marketable to young kids- hell, I was in grade 9 when I watched Battle Royale, and I remember throughout that year loaning my bootleg copy to several friends and before you know it, almost half the school was talking about it. And so that's why the idea of THG excited me- even though BR is an adult movie first and foremost, teens can relate to the issues presented, and i can say without exaggeration that I was not let down, because even though it's wasn't as good as BR, I was pleased that the intensity and brutality of BR was not lost with Collins' interpretation. Sure it isn't the most well written book, but it was so intense I found myself on a cold autumn afternoon in 2009 at home, on the edge of the couch and frantically turning each page to see what happened nextAnd then the sequels came, and I was disappointed. CF had so many great ideas but didn't utilize them properly, and Mockingjay was a mess of ideas that failed to resemble a story. Skip to a year and a half after the release of Mockingjay, I was at a midnight screening of the first movie, and as much as I found it problematic as an adaptation, it at least was entertaining. A year and a half later, I'm back at the same IMAX auditorium to see the sequel, and amazingly, I loved it enough to consider it one of my favourite films of the year. It captured the intensity the book couldn't. The ideas were there, but a book wasn't the best way to capture it. Now it's a year later and I'm just back from a preview showing of Mockingjay Part 1 and wondering why I was left so cold even though I went in knowing exactly what I was in for. Gut instinct, maybe? I hopeMockingjay is not going to change your mind about the book if you didn't like it, but because of my completist ways, I went and saw it anyway. And the problem was that it was too much like the book- a scattered collage of entertaining bits with equal amounts of filler. In fact, this film is beginning to make me wonder if maybe the series only seems awesome because of the first book's honest storytelling and the second movie's sheer intensity and electricityThe problem here is that it only makes Collins' seeming inability to balance out blazing hot action with quiet drama, and a movie-exclusive problem is that it seems to fail at emotion and drama altogether. The scenes where a brainwashed Peeta is forced into feeding the districts pro-Capitol propaganda as a devastated Katniss watches should be heartbreaking and saddening- problem is they are for the wrong reasons. They're heartbreaking and devastating because there's so many blown opportunities and you could almost imagine the writers go, 'have them start crying, that will trick the audience.' The same thing happens when Katniss visits District 8 all armed with a documentary crew and visits a hospital only for Snow to have soldiers blow it up. I should be sad and depressed to see this hall ending but the only thing that depresses me is how horribly executed it is with no emotion I'm not even going to get started on the fact that this really did not need to be two movies because if anything, I do think there was a way splitting it into two movies would have improved the story as a whole. The book's problem is that the first half is too slow and the second half is too rushed. They could easily trim an hour of fat and being some stuff in from the second half to make the film more intense. The book lacks emotional connection the same way this movie does, and so there's so many opportunities. Problem is, it's too much like The Deathly Hallows, where part 1 was filled with padding to the point where the whole thing could easily have been one movieSo what did I like? Well, I loved the storming and bombing of the hydroelectric dam. I loved the ca few flying in to rescue the hostages. I loved the final conversation between Snow and Peeta. I loved the bombing of the forest. I loved the emergency sheltering. These are enough to warrant the 5/10 I gave it, because those scenes were truly gripping and engaging. Had these kinds of intense scenes been in the movie more, maybe, just maybe I'd have walked out with some level of anticipation for the next partOtherwise there's really no reason to spend hard earned cash to watch a two hour trailer for the actual payoff. The whole thing feels like a big, two hour long trailer. It's clear they only did this to make the audience want to wait for the next part. Oh, I'll be dressing up in my district outfit and going to see the next movie for sure but not because I'm excited to because at this point I feel obligated to do so",5,59,101,20 November 2014
Black Swan," A lot of pretty pictures, but not a lot of story
","Look guys, I do 'get it'. Before you tell me to 'go watch a Die Hard box set', let me say that I am an adult moviegoer and I see at least 50 smaller/indie/foreign/what have you movies a year. So therefore that defense it totally useless. OK, now let's get on with the review.I'm not really down with Darren Aronofsky to begin with. I saw Requiem For A Dream When I was teen and boy, that film messed me up good. I was compelled to watch it after being shown a compilation of clips in an anti-drug presentation, so I sought out my friend, who has quite possibly the biggest DVD collection ever. After it was done... well let's say that movie taught me my lesson about drugs well enough. In the following years his films didn't really do much- Pi was an incomprehensible mess, The Fountain I watched 3 times and didn't get, and The Wrestler started off nice but ended poorly. However, I was interested in Black Swan when I saw the trailer with Paranormal Activity 2, so tonight I finally saw it.About the dancing scenes, as much as I actively participate in dance but know nothing about ballet, I thought they were well done. Like I said, I know absolutely nothing about ballet, so you best not trust my judgement. I thought Natalie Portman did a fantastic job, and I totally believed that Natalie did her own dancing. I thought the cast did pretty good jobs considering they were not dancers to begin with. Natalie's performance is, of course, the reason to see the movie. She is pure cash money with each performance, and this movie shows. Mila Kunis, Vincent Cassel and Barbara Hershey were good too. Oh and the movie looked pretty too. That's where the praise unfortunately stops.Basically people seem to be raving over nothing but just a middle-of-the-road horror-thriller, but with bits of weird sex added in and several over-the-top shock moments that seemed more unintentionally hilarious than shocking. Basically it's just Mulholland Drive with any being able to care for the characters taken out (We even get the obligatory lesbian sex scene- just minus having a place). In other words, you're getting a typical messed up girl story. I didn't really feel for the Nina character at all. For one, I dunno why she wouldn't just get a red flag when Vincent Cassel's character forced a kiss on her, or when he told her to touch herself. Yet somehow she's smart enough to lash out at her over-controlling mom and tell her 'I'm not 12 anymore' and dump the plush toys down the garbage disposal.Truth be told, Black Swan is honestly just an incoherent mess. There are moments of brilliance, which all go to naught when something that reduces you to laughter (at an inappropriate moment too) comes. Yeah as you guessed, I laughed at several moments that weren't meant to be funny. Like when Nina masturbates and finds her mom in the room. Or Winona Ryder going all joker on herself. The film looks nice, has good special effects and performances, but you can dress up a pig in fancy clothing and it's still a pig.Oh, but what do I know. Like most Oscar bait nowadays, this film will go to win awards and enjoy a bit of hype for a while. And then, of course, like any other movie, people are going to regret the hype and it will end up on most people's overrated lists.Cue people telling me 'I don't get it'. Shame on me for being honest, I guess.",3,12,30,29 December 2010
Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," This is ground control to Captain Jack...
","I am really unsure of how to sum up On Stranger Tides in simple words. Before I begin this review, let me state 2 things: 1. I absolutely love the first three movies, and 2. To that guy who said 'the skinny girl is not in the movie', that skinny girl is named Kiera Knightley. OK, now moving on, sort of.The first three movies were good old fashioned fun that didn't take themselves too seriously. I enjoyed them all very much and have seen them numerous times. I thought Verbinski did a hell of a job, considering he was a punk rock video director before a filmmaker. When I heard a fourth movie was being made, I got super excited. However, I had a stirring feeling of disappointment when I found out Verbinski was not directing. I'm not down with Rob Marshall- I thought Chicago was overrated and Nine was a confusing and slow mess. But, it's a Pirates movie, so I figured it'd be fun.Since I'm kinda pressed for time, I will sum up what I liked and didn't like.FIrst, the cast were great as per usual. Visually it was entertaining and the movie moved along at a nice pace... for the first hour. That, and Penelope Cruz is hot!!! And she did a great job as Angelica. Blackbeard was a cool villain, and Ian McShane does a fantastic job. There's a creepy scene involving mermaids, and that got a good reaction from those at the theatre.The bad... is everything else. First off, Barbossa is in the movie for only 20 minutes. The last hour is boring, drags a lot, and that's not all- there's a MAJOR plot hole involving the fountain of youth which is really annoying. And the 3D sucked.Overall, this is not a bad movie, but the writers are running out of ideas and it's clear.",3,0,0,21 May 2011
Sucker Punch," The critics were wrong... yet again
","I'm starting to wonder if we're seeing the same movies as the critics nowadays. Or at least, if we're getting different cuts of movies. Because I've often found myself walking out going 'Did I see a different movie than the critics?' Of course, Snyder is no stranger to critical disdain. He may be the most misunderstood director out there. True his films aren't for everyone, but if you look close enough you may just find something there. And Sucker Punch is the biggest example of how big a visionary he is- Here he manages to bring to the table a satisfying and exciting new vision.I was in right from the opening scene. A cover of Sweet Dreams set to a fantastic and tone setting scene depicting her abuse from her wicked stepfather. WHAT an opening scene.We are then transported to Mount Pleasant Insane Asylum, once a performing arts venue. Baby Doll is just a drop in the ocean of how many beautiful girls who can dance. Baby Doll doesn't know this until she saves Rocket, another one of the girls. There she meets the rest of the gang, and the sexy Goski, a doctor who has a form of therapy- dance. When Baby Doll dances, she can slay dragons, fight robots, wield swords, etc. The girls love her- but as it stands, she's dancing... to escape from the asylum with the girls.The concept may not sound dazzling- but wait till you see it. Sucker Punch is what its title states- a conceptual sucker punch. Nothing can prepare you for what you will experience. You are in the world with Baby Doll- you feel as if you are experiencing Baby Doll's therapy with her. Snyder totally does a great job with this aspect, and as a theatre nerd and dance lover, arts as therapy really hit home because it's very true, and I've experienced that euphoria from being a performer.The acting is fantastic, and Emily Browning is great as both an action chick and a confused, disturbed girl. Cugino is sexy and adds her usual charm to her role. Hamm as Blue is easily the best, as his villain is certainly convincing.Add to that, one of the best soundtracks ever put to film. Working with Tyler Bates, Browning covers a few songs, and quite a few others contribute too. And Bjork's 'Army of Me' has never sounded cooler.I was sceptical- Snyder has struck gold with 300, Watchmen and Guardians, but could he manage to make one of his original ideas spark? As a result he can- and he did. Do NOT be a puppet of the critics- experience Sucker Punch with an open mind. Touche, Zack Snyder... Touche.",2,29,58,26 March 2011
Source Code," Better than expected but still cheesy and annoying
","I'll admit I went in to Source Code with zero expectations at all- it didn't look very appealing from the trailer. However, I'll admit I did like a few parts. There are a couple scenes of gorgeously shot, tear-jerkingly beautiful brilliance. That, and the cinematography is worth noting- It is very slick and tone-setting. But the way this movie plays out, it's almost like a parody of the intellectual science fiction thriller. The story has been done before- a computer program where you are allowed to enter someone's body. The Matrix did it, and to a lesser extent but not in the form of a computer program- Being John Malkovich, that movie where a portal was opened in an office building and you could enter John Malkovich's mind for a few minutes. Except here, the program is so that Jake Gyllenhaal can find the bomber of a train. The acting is unbelievably bad. I felt like I was watching a cheaply made TV movie. Gyllenhaal was acted off the screen by that ridiculous hairpiece of his. The plot is so deathly slow, dull, and takes nearly forever to get going, and one of the worst endings EVER absolutely ruins what could have been a good action thriller to begin with. Overall, avoid. OVERALL: 2/10 PROS: -Gorgeously shot -Nice special effects CONS: -Pretty much everything else -One of the worst scripts of 2011, almost this year's 'Salt' -Boring buildup to a total non-conclusion -Some of the worst acting this side of Community Theatre",2,2,7,25 May 2011
Iron Man 3," Marvel's Avengers Phase Two starts in style, as Iron Man's trilogy draws to a satisfying close
","Right off the bat, Iron Man 3 has a very different feel to it than the previous feel.even tony Stark himself reflects this in his narration that opens the film, where he says something along the lines of, 'things are different now, and I'm a different man'. Even the tone is different, and very unique. It isn't like the first two at all, even- this is reflected by Brian Tyler's score. Whereas the first two movies feel more polished, this film feels more raw and personal.Tony Stark suffers from PTSD as a result of the events in 'The Avengers', and furthermore, said events have made him realize that he's more vulnerable than ever now. Tony has to protect Pepper Potts, and his entire city. As a means of twiddling thumbs, Tony keeps adding upgrades to his Iron Suits. In one upgrade, he can signal them over piece by piece so he can begin wearing it from afar, and another upgrade is that he can move the suits himself. But even these won't stop Stark from suffering from nightmares and panic attacks about the New York events. He feels like he's in greater danger than ever before. This is even so much that he has the suits guard them while he sleeps.For the first part of the film, the plot centers around this and two others: The Mandarin, a mysterious villain who commits acts of terrorism and transmits disturbing images warning people about his full potential. And then there's Aldridge Kyllian, a handsome but mysterious and brilliant scientist who has a cure for all weakness: Extremis, an addictive drug that helps people regenerate through body heat. Admittedly, the latter seems ridiculous given the context of the first two films, taking Iron Man in a more sci-fi direction that is admittedly very unexpected, but it works, in a way you wouldn't expect either.What's really interesting about this film though is the sheer irony of Tony Stark spending at least 90% of the movie out of the iron suit. Yes, even more so than Iron Man 2, which was similarly light on iron, but heavy on stark. Don't let that worry you, though; in fact, by the time the final battle comes along, you won't have even cared about the fact that he spends so much of the movie out of the suit. He even goes so far as to make a stealth break-in in one scene using store-bought materials. And the use of the self-moving suit (controlled by Tony from an external source) is used brilliantly in the airplane scene. I don't have a fear flying, but I do have a fear of falling and the cinematography, even in IMAX, had me suffering intense bouts of vertigo. The plane scene is one of the more well-done action scenes in the movie, and is executed very cleverly. The final battle does cost the film some points in that there's too many suits used in the scene, making it very hard to follow at times, but it's a fun scene to watch, and some very clever twists and cliffhangers are used.Also, stay around for the bonus scene after the credits. I guarantee, you won't be disappointed. In short, Iron Man 3 is the worst of the film and it does have some flaws, but it's still tons of fun to watch. It's both a blazingly exciting action epic and a character study that deconstructs Tony Stark's character very cleverly. Even if you find tons of things wrong with the sooty, you'll still enjoy it for the fun it offers.",9,14,22,4 September 2013
Star Trek," Who said they don't make 'em like they used to anymore?
","Now firstly, I was not a Trekkie before seeing this last night at the cinema in Digital projection. However though, the trailer looked amazing, and I remember watching the show on TV on the Space Network every morning before going to school. I also remember dressing up as Data from The Next Generation on TV.Anyways, last night I saw this in a packed cinema with every single seat taken. We had gotten tickets in advance, and got to the theater early. Good thing we did- the lineup was longer than the great wall of China! We were lucky to get good seats too. And boy, we LOVED this movie! Anybody would like this movie, even people who don't like Star Trek. Hell, Even my sister who didn't like it loved it. There were even a lot of non-Trekkies in our theater, if I had to guess.This movie is a reboot of the franchise, taking us back to the very beginning. We learn the origins of the characters Spock and James Tiberius Kirk, Kirk's bumbling misadventures at the Starfleet Academy, Spock and Kirk's rivalry, the Klingon, and much more.The movie is flat out perfection in every sense of the word. The special effects are excellent, the visuals are breathtaking. Sometimes there are Camera flares (meaning light reflecting off the camera), adding to the 'beautifully shot' feel of the movie. The action is top notch- The hand-held camera adds to the intensity of the scenes (don't worry, the camera doesn't shake all over the place, you can actually see what's going on). There's tons of humor too- Kirk is HILARIOUS, as well as there are tons of hilarious moments in this movie, including Kirk getting all the injections- now that was hilarious! The best thing about the film is the casting- Chris Pine is awesome as Kirk, and is really funny here. I was surprised to find out he played Darwin Tremor in Smokin' Aces too- he was hilarious in that one as well. Karl Urban as McCoy, John Cho as Hikaru Sulu, and the sexy Zoe Saldanha as Uhura is awesome too. Anton Yelchin as Chekov and Simon Pegg as Scotty were hilarious too, Pegg was the PERFECT Scotty. Truly fit the quirkiness of the character.But the real high point of the performances is Zachary Quinto as Spock. He plays Spock perfectly. The look, the tone of voice... he really IS Spock. He makes a lot of Spockish facial expressions throughout too, he's really Nimoy-esquire. Speaking of Leonard Nimoy, he's in the movie too! It was a great surprise to see the original Spock.So in short, do NOT miss this while it's in the cinema. Abrams has really nailed it here. Well, I'm now a fan of Star Trek thanks to this movie! People applauded at the cinema when the movie was over. I was one of those people, in fact I even yelled 'YEAH!'.",10,5,15,10 May 2009
Fight Club," Mischief. Mayhem. Self destruction may be the answer...
","Fight Club is a movie that grabs you and refuses to let go. You won't be able to forget the imagery, the catchy storyline, and the unforgettable performances by Ed Norton and Bradd Pitt.Poor Jack has not been having a good life. He has had a busy year, he is an insomniac, he goes to several anonymous meetings just to keep himself busy. Every meeting he attends, a beautiful woman named Marla always follows him. She even attends the testicular cancer one (LMAO!).While on a flight home from a business trip, Jack meats a man named Tyler Durden. Tyler is a soap salesman, and after poor old Jack finds out his home has been blown up, he goes to live with Tyler in an old abandoned house. Soon, Jack and Tyler create their own club called 'Fight Club', an underground club where people can hold fights.Soon, the project becomes controversial and turns into something called 'Project Mayhem', a club planned by Tyler, where every night, each member causes destruction and chaos. It's only a matter of time before Jack becomes confused, and things spiral out of control.This is one of the best movies I have ever seen. I saw this back in January, and I thought it was gonna be the same old fight movie, but it's not! I couldn't believe what I was missing. I didn't know how amazing it was going to be! Plus, there's a HUGE twist at the end, that will shock you like no other, and leave you breathless! So if you like movies like this, this is a total must have.",10,1,5,16 November 2007
The Maze Runner," It's like The Hunger Games, but 100x more confusing!
","If you liked The Hunger Games but felt it didn't nearly have enough rules, then The Maze Runner is for you!The Maze runner takes place sometime in the future, where a young man whose name I forget so I'll refer to him as his slang name he gets called, Greeny, wakes up in an elevator and is constantly taunted and teased by all the other ones for not being as gifted and able as the others despite the fact that he only just woke up there. In particular, a kid who looks as if his mother has been giving him Botox injections since he was a toddler stands as the big boss and Jorjen from Game of Thrones stands as the kid who is all 'don't worry, guys, he couldn't possibly harm us' nice man with an awful British accent (strangely despite the fact that the actor portraying him is British). Then there's plenty of others but for the first twenty minutes or so, apparently these guys are the only important characters in the movieAnyways so they're surrounded by a maze and nobody can go in at night or they'll be devoured by these monsters called 'Grievers' which look like John Malkovich's character in The Hitchhikers Guide to the a Galaxy but with bigger legs. And this is where the film starts to get really problematic. First off, this apparently takes place sometime after the apocalypse, but how on earth did whatever company that made this get all that metal? And if they truly wanted nobody to escape, the walls didn't need to be that high. The height that they are seems to be trying too hard to impress the audience. And as for the Grievers, many problems there too. They can apparently climb the walls. Why don't they? And why are they even there in the first place??? They seem to be thrown in just for the sake of having a big bad guy. They don't even explain it at the end during the typical 'we need this explanatory monologue to tell the audience why this movie makes sense and they're wrong to be confused' scene at the end. If you don't have a reason for these creatures then your movie is stupidSo anyways, the kid from Teen Wolf, I mean Greeny, and the obligatory Asian guy get locked in the maze for a night and by sheer miracle, Greeny is able to outsmart a griever. Alright maybe it isn't a miracle because Greeny seems to have no problem outrunning him and seems to know what to do, and things only get super complicated when he's squeezing himself through a big set of closing walls and boom, bye bye Griever. So when they get back to the center, he tells them he killed one and instead of being happy they get mad at him. Again, no explanation given why. So he gets promoted to 'Runner' status and while out in the maze, where they go find the Griever corpse, they find something lodged in its brain: a canister that acts as their key to their base. Anyways while out in the maze he and wither find that there is a hole where the Grievers get in through, then suddenly the maze goes apeshit on them and they try to make it back to base. Then suddenly a girl pops up! But for some reason she isn't that important. Or maybe she is because she keeps pretty much info dumping the plot.Ugh, I'm going to stop here because the more I type the angrier I get about this movie. But the whole time, I kept thinking about the hunger games, but this had more rules than it, more plot details and at a few points it got so confusing that it felt like a brain workout to continue watching. And not the good kind like Donnie Darko or an early Cronenberg movie. But that here are so many story lines and rules and plot details that. It was almost like they shoved an entire trilogy into one movie. I would say maybe the book is better but considering the book was written by a middle school student, I don't even think the movie even has that advantage.Mind you there are some things I liked about the film. It looked pretty and the special effects a re decent, so they get my 3/10 rating for that, but wooden acting and nonsensical plot really does it in",3,4,8,25 October 2014
Inglourious Basterds," Far from 'Inglourious'...
","A group of Jewish American soldiers. A girl who has fled her home after the brutal massacre of her family. And a group of Nazis occupying France, who will premiere their Nazi propaganda movie at a small theater. How do all these topics fit all together? They are the pieces that form the puzzle that is 'Inglourious Basterds'.Brad Pitt plays Lt. Aldo Raine, a Jewish-American solider leading a group of other Jewish-American soldiers, named 'The Inglourious Basterds', into France. Their job is to do one thing- exact their revenge against the Nazis for their horrible crimes against humanity. They plan to brutally scalp the Nazis and kill them. As Raine says, 'We're killin' Nazis, and business is bloomin''. They have also targeted a movie theater, where the premiere of the aforementioned Nazi propaganda movie is to take place.Shosanna Dreyfus is a French Jewish girl who has fled her home after the Nazis have massacred her family. She flees to a movie theater that her aunt gave to her long after she died. One night, she meets a charming young man outside the theater, and the next day she sees him again. She is annoyed by him, but is invited by the man to lunch. Turns out he is a Nazi soldier, and that he has brought her to his Nazi family. Hans Linda, the Nazi leader who massacred her family, tells Shosanna and the Nazi family that her theater is the perfect place to premiere the movie. After it is confirmed that the premiere at her cinema is officially 'Nazi Night', Shosanna and her partner projectionist have only one plan- to burn the theater to the ground.Coming in at 154 minutes, 'Inglourious Basterds' is a film that does not overstay its welcome. Every minute of its length is epic, and the whole time, you're glued to your theater seat, wanting to know what happens next. The way Quentin Tarantino structures the plot, he sticks to his usual 'Chapters' formula, and presents the two stories in a way in which in the last 45 minutes, they come together like pieces of a puzzle. This is enough to keep any moviegoer satisfied! As for performances, every single performance in this is amazing. Pitt does a brilliant job at portraying the cold and brutal personality of Aldo Raine. Also in the film is Diane Kruger, who plays Bridget, a woman the Basterds meet along the way. She has proved herself to be quite the actress over time, and with her being German, she is definitely an easy target for the role. But the REAL star of the show is Christoph Waltz, playing Hans Linda. He steals the show in every aspect here, and he's the type you wouldn't imagine playing a cold and ruthless Nazi.If you're a big fan of Tarantino, you can also expect his usual trademarks: Red Apple Cigarettes, The woman's feet shot, the usage of music from other movies (the music of Ennio Morricone is a huge character here), and the homage to other films. All of these are shown in the film. The film pays homage to European WWII movies, and does it brilliantly. Also, his dialogue, which is something he's been known for, is the best dialogue in any of his films.Think of 'Inglourious Basterds' as 'Pulp Fiction' set in Nazi-Occupied in France. In short,' Inglourious Basterds' is a phenomenal piece of film-making and proved to be an excellent day at the cinema.",10,5,15,18 September 2009
Iron Man 2," No Rust on this 'Iron'
","I will admit that I was a tad worried about Iron Man 2, because, well let's face it, the first movie was so fantastic that it was almost untouchable. I mean, with the first movie, you had the extraordinary talents of Downey, Howard, Paltrow, Bridges and plenty more anchoring what was an incredible must-see summer slam of a movie. However, seeing the trailers for the second movie made me think 'Uh oh, Spider Man 3 all over again.' Sequels, especially superhero ones, seem to think that since they bring tons of random crap and characters into the frame, that they are always better, and as excited as I was for this movie, I felt it was going to be another one of those movies. So upon going into the theater, I kept those worries in mind.Well, I can now officially say that those worries didn't prevent me from loving the movie.Remember when Michael Bay tried to accomplish something epic with Transformers 2 with all these new characters and stuff? Well, Jon Faverau has managed to accomplish what Michael Bay never did- make a near-perfect sequel that manages to be just as great as the first. Now like the first, there's not a ton of action, but those scenes where action is absent, Faverau manages to make the most out of them. Complete with great action, laughs and characters, Iron Man 2 is the first big summer movie, and a must see on the big screen for sure, especially if you see it in digital! Iron Man 2 picks up half a year from when the first movie left off. The Stark Expo has just begun in Flushing, New York, and is to last all year. Tony, in a televised hearing, privatizes world peace. Life seems to be great, except for the fact that the reactor keeping him alive is killing him. This doesn't stop him from being Iron Man though- he continues to go on as Iron Man for the moment. He even considers replacing Pepper Potts with Natalie Rushman, appointing Potts a CEO to Stark Industries. However, in Russia, Ivan Vanko, the son of physicist Anton Vanko, having just lost his father and jealous of Stark's success, creates his own arc reactor, and becomes Whiplash, a badass villain with two electrified whips that can split anything in half with enough force.His first appearance is at a race in Monaco, and after a brief (and failed) attempt to kill Tony, he meets up with Justin Hammer, Stark's rival, and they both collaborate to build a new technology that will hopefully overthrow Tony. However, with a stint at Tony's house appointing James Rhodes as War Machine, and several other plots, Tony Stark, suffering through personal problems, doesn't know if he really can be Iron Man and resolve all this.Now the plot may not sound that great, but when you see it in the movie, you will be impressed with how complex it is. To not spoil too much, I left some stuff out, because the movie is that great. Aside from the plot, everything else is great. The acting here is fantastic! Robert Downey Jr. has his usual charm here, playing the lovable dick-head that is Tony Stark. Replacing Terrence Howard is Don Cheadle, and he does it well! I can't believe I am saying this but I actually preferred him to Howard. Howard was great but wooden in places, whereas Cheadle was great the whole way. And Scarlett Johannson whoa. When is she NEVER eye candy? As for her performance- this movie proves she is not just another pretty face. Her fight scene is just mind blowingly amazing! Mickey Rourke gives a a fantastic performance as well, and manages to shine as the villain, Of course, halfway through, the movie takes a break from the action and focuses on some character development- I was worried about it at first hearing but as I was watching the movie, I realized that sometimes, in superhero movies, character development does more than whiz-bang action. Don't worry guys, the scenes where action is absent are just as great as the scenes with action. But the action scenes are INCREDIBLE!!!! People are exaggerating the lack of action- the last 20 minutes alone has more action than the first, and is certainly more thrilling than the first too. The climax certainly is a thrill, and I gotta say I had a blast seeing it on the big screen.So in short, Iron Man 2 is a success. I had tons of fun seeing it on the big screen. A great sequel and a great standalone movie, Iron Man 2 is a sequel that truly kicks ass. Whatever worries you may have, I recommend you cast them aside, because you're in for a 2 hour fun ride. So if you wanna see a sequel that truly kicks ass, this movie is it!",8,10,18,5 May 2010
The Hunger Games," Spoiler alert: Gary Ross made a very big and long trailer for a Hunger Games movie
","In all honesty, I appreciate the efforts of Gary Ross and co. He did what he could with what is really difficult source material, and in some form he managed to really pull it off. The film has great graphics and such, and right off the bat it already feels more intimate than your typical blockbuster thanks to some very low-key mood setting and hand-held camera.But judging by the way the story is presented, this ultimately felt more like a fan movie than an official presentation. I mean yes there are flashes of brilliance throughout- one in particular being the Countdown scene. A moment of quiet brilliance. The embrace between Cinna and Katniss, the elevator to the arena, etc. Then the sudden blast into brutal violence. I will also admit found Haymitch to be hilarious too, great acting from Woody Harrelson. I knew when I read the book that he had to be played by Woody, and I got what I hoped.One more positive comment: Jennifer Lawrence was amazing, she was not an Oscar nominee for nothing people. She really helped lift the movie off the ground. She IS Katniss and she managed to keep the movie running, though weak and sloppy it may be.Now for the bad parts. Warning there's tons of spoilers.First, if I had to narrow down what I loved about the book to one thing was its intensity. Sure the book wasn't particularly amazingly written but Susanne knew how to keep a rising line of tension throughout the book. She kept the action constant, the violence brutal and she saved the romance for when appropriate. The movie has almost zero suspense in the action scenes. I get that the filmmakers wanted to go for that 'silent action' thing, and problem is for this movie it doesn't work. It worked for Haywire, it worked for Edge of Darkness, it worked for Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy but for a movie about a bunch of kids forced to kill each other.The next big problem was there was not very much development. Sure Katniss is well developed but thats only because she is the protagonist. We don't get a sense that the kids in the other districts are connected, etc. Peeta's backstory is COMPLETELY CUT OUT. Primrose comes and goes. Effie Trinket gets a small amount of development in the sense that she as been around since the reaping began but that's it.Oh, and the adaptation discontinuity. Cutting out various big parts (Madge Undersee, AVOX, etc) while emphasizing on smaller parts (Rue's death goes on for an atrociously long 10 minutes. They know each other for like 2 minutes then suddenly they are trying to get her out from the net, then she gets speared and Katniss cries for 10 minutes) and adding in parts that AREN'T IN THE BOOK (When Cato and the careers see smoke they leave a kid behind, and Foxface steals food without anyone knowing. So then Katniss tries stealing supplies and blows them up. And she doesn't go deaf or lose an ear.I guess it's a good standalone movie and those who haven't read the book will like it. I'll admit it deserves credit there, but in the end it felt like a big long trailer for a better movie. I'd say skip it and read the book. Or wait for the 6 hour director's cut.",6,1,2,4 June 2012
127 Hours," It really shouldn't work
","Really. The true story of Aron Ralson who went on an adventure in the Grand Canyon and spent 127 Hours in a crack trying to get out after a large boulder traps his arm between the boulder and a wall of the crack. He nearly goes insane and after 127 hours, cuts his arm off to escape.From the sounds of it, it shouldn't work as a movie. There's no way a one man show with a man stuck in a crack being the focus of a whole movie can translate well.But the shocking thing is, it does work. And surprisingly very well.After his stellar Slumdog Millionaire, Danny Boyle gives us this look into the mind of Aron Ralston. This movie has an interesting film style- with all the shots from inside his water bag, the split screens, the satirical talk show scene, etc.James Franco is amazing in this flick. James Franco isn't James Franco in this movie... he really IS Aron Ralston. His emotions, facial expressions, mannerisms, etc. It was entirely believable, and he really is one-man show material. He manages to anchor the movie and make the one-man show entertaining.'The Scene' apparently caused some faintings, and really, I don't know why. It isn't really that graphic. I've seen many worse scenes, and it's not even that gory/bloody. It is, however, incredibly intense and hard to watch, and Franco really makes it believable.Overall, 127 Hours is an incredible movie, truly Oscar material. Although not my first choice for Best Picture It manages to be very entertaining, and will completely defy all of your expectations.Oh, Danny Boyle, you magnificent bastard... how do you do it?",10,0,1,15 February 2011
Terminator Salvation," It's our fault, really...
","...we basically gave into McG's scam, we basically demanded more after the awful T3. It's easy to see, really- the series ended at T2 for me. No need to continue after T2.Who is this McG dude again? Oh right, he's some douche bag with a ridiculous moniker (McG??????) and has only directed a handful of movies and a couple rap videos. Yep, that's right, we have a guy with almost no experience in film directing a film in a franchise that's very easy to screw up: Terminator. And you know something's up when T3, which was also a piece of crap, starts looking like a good movie in comparison to the newest crappy entry in the series.Christian Bale is in this movie, which is unfortunately a missed opportunity as well. It's no wonder he had a meltdown on the set of this movie- nobody can blame him. This movie is pure muck. I saw this on opening weekend, and walked away as satisfied as much as I was when seeing '9' (in other words, not satisfied). Like I mentioned before, this is a very easy franchise to f--k up, and McG did just that.There's literally nothing to spoil in here. There's basically no plot except something about protecting the universe. The action scenes are very poorly done, with the shaky camera and quick cutting (WHEN WILL DIRECTORS STOP SHAKING THE GODDAMN CAMERA!!!!!!). I could hardly tell what was going on. The acting is awful- except for the excellent performance by Anton Yelchin, who is someone I don't usually like. But even he can't save the movie from sucking out loud. And Sam Worthington is a wasted opportunity here- he was AMAZING in Avatar, and horrible in this too... also, I'm a real Bonham-Carter fanboy, yet she even sucked in this too. The dialogue is terrible ('We have won the battle, but we haven't won the war'??? I think I heard that on an episode of Power Rangers). Yep, you guessed it, this movie sucks out loud",5,2,4,10 January 2010
Juno," The most bizarre and pretentious movie I've seen
","Back in 08, when the movie came out on DVD, there was a huge buzz about it winning best screenplay and, so I decided I should check it out.The movie is about a 16 year old girl named Juno MacGuff. I'm not kidding. I'm serious. Throughout the movie I tried to pretend that name wasn't the most pretentious female protagonist name I've ever heard but I failed. She talks like a real smartass and acts all cocky to people. She's 16 and is in love with Paulie Bleeker (again, another pretentious 'indie' name). One day she finds out that she got pregnant from a time when she and Paulie had sex. She considers having an abortion, but after being forced to face the fact that once you make a decision it stays with you forever, she decides to come out about her pregnancy to her parents and give it up for adoption. She finds one family in a classified ad who has an infertile mother and goes to get to know them. She takes a keen kinship to the husband, who loves indie music and cinema, including one situation where they watch the 70s cheese horror flick 'The Wizard of Gore'. Then a bunch of drama and depressing indie pretentiousness ensues and... I... just... don't... freaking... care. The end.I didn't HATE this film. Some lines were funny and I liked some of the cast, including the guy who played Jameson from Spider Man, Jennifer Garner, and Jason Bateman, who of course charms in each role. One particularly powerful scene was when Juno has an emotional breakdown in the van- Finally she acts instead of trying to be a teenager and spewing cocky words.To say the characters are cardboard is an understatement- they're TISSUE PAPER THIN. Juno is not likable at all. Why should I sympathize for her? She's just a smartassed cocky borderlining-on-bitch who has absolutely no reason to be in the story other than the fact that she's the protagonist and she's pregnant. And her constant pop culture references were don't help either. Paulie I have no respect for- come on, getting a girl knocked up before she's even old enough to drive has no respectability in it, and the movie tries to make me care about him by making him all 'cute' and 'awkward' but come on. Also, this film in a way almost glamorizes teen pregnancy- Their parents are cool with her being pregnant AT 16 (I've known people in this situation and trust me, their parents were the exact opposite of that). There's much more but it would be too long to list. Oh and for the record, I don't think I've EVER heard anyone say 'Pork swords'.I don't even think creepy looking assassins with stupid haircuts and silenced shotguns could have saved this film. It's not terrible but I honestly don't get why it's so praised.",3,2,6,9 July 2010
Spider-Man 3," Seriously?????
","This movie was so bad and convoluted, it was ridiculous, Let me start off by saying that I have seen both Spider Man 1 and 2 in on their opening weeks, and they freaking' rocked. Actually, Spider Man 2 is one of the best movies I have seen in a theatre. Then I saw Spider Man 3 on opening weekend... and Sam Raimi has officially destroyed my love of the franchise. Sadly. I felt as if Sam played a practical joke on us instead of giving us the real Spider-Man 3. There seems to be a limit though on the amount of words so I'll get straight down to it: -The opening fight between Harry and Peter. Wolverine would roll his eyes, it was so dumb. And then of course, the scene ends with Harry getting Amnesia from hitting his head so hard on a rock! WOW!!!! Jessica Simpson did a great job at writing this!!!! Seriously though. That scene was so stupid that everyone was laughing in the theatre.-I'm not kidding, the whole Amnesia subplot was hilariously bad. All of a sudden, Harry is happier and smiler, and rockin' and rollin'. Franco... please do us a favour and don't give into scripts where your character's amnesia causes your character to be all smiley and happy, because you look and act like an idiot. No joke.-Sandman. Actually, the whole movie should be cited as a giant epic Sandman failure. He has no development and is just tacked in there to be all cool and badass. And his introduction was hilarious. What is this Military thing in the desert with lots of sand??? And why does he fall into it? And more importantly, why does nobody there notice some random guy in the pit, and the machine turning on? -And also, can someone tell me the point of the whole American Flag gag? Is it because Mr. Raimi had to thrust red, white and blue in your face? Excuse me, I may be a little while on this one, like I have been for the past 3 years.-Too many villains, too many subplots, too many coincidences. This seriously drove me crazy. I couldn't follow what went on, because of this.-Gwen Stacy. WOW. WASTED POTENTIAL. The idiotic comments defending her are ridiculous, just like her. No point, except to be hot and sexy, which she is, but that doesn't mean she was a consistent character.-The Symbiote was seriously stupid. I loved the slick black design, but all of a sudden, Peter goes emo and starts doing sexualized dance movements to girls in the street.-Speaking of which, whose idea was it to turn the movie into a musical romantic comedy? We have Peter walking around dancing inappropriately, and then then that scene in the club which lasts 10 minutes (it honestly felt like 10 hours). My brain was so tired by that point that when the next scene came, I could only think of that. Oh, and then because he accidentally smacked MJ (that was actually a moment that I applauded at because she was unbearable throughout the whole movie- who would date her at all??????? I certainly would not), he goes all depressed and wants to give it up.-And yes, this movie is as depressing as I am making it sound like! MJ being a total dog? Check. Aunt May's boring advice? Check. Spidey emo? Check. Emo hair? Check. Boring breakup subplot? Check. This is SPIDER MAN, DAMMIT! WE WANT THE ACTION!!!! NOT HOUR OF SOAP OPERA MATERIAL!!!!! -Venom is seriously, the biggest disappointment of any movie. First off, he's only in the movie for 5 MINUTES, and has literally 4 lines. And he's not the Venom I am used to- Instead he is a totally sleazy douche bag becoming a totally sleazy douche bag, as usual.-Oh, Sandman killed my dad. Even though he is a murderer and a monster and is using his 'family' BS as an excuse, I'm just going to forgive him anyway! Seriously, that bit was so stupid, I literally laughed out loud in the theatre.-And that ending. YAWWWWN.... what happened to the 'Get ready for the next movie' ending? Instead we just have boring stuff about Peter and MJ dancing...-Too long for its own good, yet at the same time, too short for all the material crammed in. When you have a movie with a ridiculous amount of villains and subplots, it becomes too long, but then at the same time, it's not long enough, why? Because so much is crammed in that there's not enough time to explore them all.I could type more, but I'm getting angry just thinking about it.",5,1,4,21 December 2009
Cloverfield," It's best factor is people's biggest complaint
","Gee, there's a lot of negative reviews. Have the trolls taken over??? Oh I get it, A bunch of people are resorting to their 'OMG The CAMERA IZ The SHAXZERZ IT MAYKEZ ME DIZZY!!!!!!!11!' bullcrap. Well guess what? NOBODY CARES.This film was meant to be shaky. You think you can run down a street and hold a camera straight??? If so, you're an idiot. I saw this on opening day and I'll never forget how much tension was going through me. I was on the edge of my seat the whole time.The story is: A group of people are throwing a goodbye party for their friend going away to Japan. On the night of the party, a monster attacks and terrorizes the city, and 5 people must fight to stay alive. The movie was taken from the point of Hud and the video camera, and this film is done in the very interesting style of filming an account of the attack.This movie was amazing. Fantastic acting, straight and to-the-point action, wastes no time on character development, and has one of the most chilling apocalyptic endings since The Birds. The ending is rather left open, and that's a good thing, because I'd rather that type of ending than an ending where the monster dies and people celebrate like nothing ever happened.Another thing I like was how there were NO clichés- there is no scene where the scientist steps into the frame and delivers a boring, 5 minute Shakespearian monologue about the origin of the Monster. You don't know where the monster came from... and that's a good thing.So overall, in the time of cliché'd and stupid movies like Sex And The City, Shutter, Meet The Spartans, and 27 Dresses, we get a very tight and fast paced film that is very No-BS, has your heart racing, your adrenaline pumping, and your blood rushing. Overall, a very profound movie. And please kick yourself in the nuts if you didn't see this in the theater. I saw it in the theater on opening day and loved it. I own it on DVD. That very day I saw it, I was on the edge of my seat and felt like I was on a nonstop roller-coaster.",10,3,6,20 January 2010
Silent Hill," A 2 hour movie about nothing
","Sometimes, when I thumb through reviews of movies on Amazon and IMDb, particularly those I don't like- actually being even more specific, those being made out to be absolutely amazing due to the general hype and histrionics- I notice the terms 'intelligent' and 'dripping with atmosphere'. More often than not, I can't help feel they're essentially using those terms, because they need SOMETHING to substitute 'full of plot holes/pretentious' and 'very beautifully shot but lacking in anything else substantial'. Sadly, Silent Hill is one of those films.I bring this up because last night, Silent Hill showed on TV last night. It showed on a Yankee TV station, and I still had time before I hit the bed, so I figured I would watch it. I remember seeing it at the cinema back in 2006, and generally not liking it at all. But who knows, what have I got to lose but time? It couldn't be as bad as it was back in 2006, could it?Wow, actually, it was much worse than I expected. And back in 2006.If anything, this film could be summed up like this: it's awesome visually. It looks like the inside of a criminally insane man-child's mind, with the glowing embers, the desaturated colours and the depressing atmosphere. However, plot wise, it's like you're watching a dress rehearsal they're throwing in story elements as they go along. I haven't played the game, so I can't comment on the overall faithfulness to the source material. But what I can say is that I've read reviews that say this is exactly like the game. So I should give it that, right? No, actually. I want something more than being faithful to a video game of all things. I can't sum up the plot at all, because essentially there's no plot... hell, something tells me this film has no SCRIPT even!!!! Its like they just came up with everything on the spot.In other words, this is a 2 hour movie about nothing. NOTHING. Had a hard time trying to stay awake during this movie, couldn't wait for it to be over. I would complain about the glaring plot holes in the film, plot canyons, even, but  there's really nothing to complain about in this film in terms of plot since there's really NO CONTENT in terms of a script.The acting, in addition, is extremely awful. The cop is boring and says all her lines as if shes in a hypnotic trance of some sort. Radha Mitchell is just as boring and watching her is like watching an acting robot. Needless to say I'm sure the films script, or lack of, didn't excite them to the point where they cared about their characters.Boring, far too long, missing any plot of any sort and a script to speak of, this is a very thankless, self indulgent and pretentious bore of a film to be avoided at all cost.",5,1,3,6 November 2011
The Adventures of Tintin," Hamburgers
","I don't know if it's just me, but in all fairness, I found Tintin to be like a big, greasy burger from McDonalds. Sure it has the power to tempt you with its big lettuce and cheese and tomatoes and it's juicy patty... But even despite the yumminess of the burger, it's a dull experience overall as you've devoured nothing of actual substance.I'll admit, for the first thirty minutes of Tintin, I was hooked. I hadn't read a single comic book, watched a single cartoon or even encounter a piece of literature that bore the name 'Tintin' as a child, so this was all new experience to me. Unfortunately, the fun only lasted for thirty minutes. About two hours later, I left the cinema not only feeling dazed from all the 3D effects and always moving camera shots, but also wondering why they even bothered to try to make CG animated film out of something that clearly looked as if it wasn't meant to be a film.Don't get me wrong guys. I don't mean any disrespect to Stevie S, as he is a fantastic filmmaker and has made dozens of fantastic films throughout his career. But frankly, Tintin was just... Boring.I think the biggest problem lies in its protagonist. Tintin is a very empty character and almost a Gary Stu. Everything seems to go exactly as planned for him and he seems to have no weaknesses or defaults. I'll remind you yet again that I didn't know anything about Tintin before going in, so I'm not sure if I missed the point of anything but really... He was just a dull character, and not interesting enough to warrant an entire movie based around him. It really is a shame because Haddock, his partner was a fun and quirky character, and kept me watching. And the spine tingling chillingness of Daniel Craig's Saccharine was just mesmerizing, gorgeous to watch even and how he played the evil character nicely. So... Couldn't the movie's own damned protagonist do anything to show he's worthy of a movie?I also don't know of this is just me, but I could tell the writers were trying to force too many eggs into one basket. I have no idea what stories this takes inspiration from but I just feel like this was just a bunch of stories mashed together with no cohesion. However, at least it looked pretty. At least it gave me something to look at when I wasn't trying to wrap my head around the not very interesting story, or how many of those there were. Alas, this is a film I could see myself putting on at parties as a background type thing, you know? But if I were to try and sit through the film again, I'd have a headache from it all. So I guess my review should be a 3/10... But it did look pretty, so I'll give it a 5. For one it could have been a lot worse.Hey, for one, we could have gotten another 'Immortals' with this one. At least we didn't. At least.",5,0,1,15 March 2012
Megamind," Moderately sized mind
","This film is 1/3 a great movie, 1/3 a decent flick that could make for at least a decent studio filler before Dreamworks' Kung Fu Panda 2, and 1/3 a boring snoozefest that was definitely not worth catching a 9 PM screening of. Maybe Dreamworks is starting to run out of original ideas- it seems to be their best animated stuff is adaptations- Shrek, How To Train Your Dragon, etc. Not to say I didn't like Monsters Vs. Aliens or Kung Fu Panda, but I feel as if when they derive, they are in their own little league.I saw the trailer with Toy Story 3. It looked like a good movie- Will Ferrell, Tina Fey, Brad Pitt, Jonah Hill, etc. That, plus its concept of a deconstruction of superhero movie seemed funny, except I already saw that 3 months beforehand when I went and saw Despicable Me 3D. Nonetheless I chose to ignore the warning signs and went in.The movie was working for 20 minutes. Especially in its opening scenes, with how we're introduced to how Megamind is apparently having the worst day of his life, as he is falling to his death. I will admit I laughed at the 'Aw, a baby! How flattering.' line, the childhood was cute, and I was just generally loving it.Then the second act came, where Megamind was bored because he's officially defeated Metro Man and there's nothing to do. That's quite symbolic because not a lot happens (at least that I am able to remember for the life of me) happens in this period of time, except for Megamind posing as a janitor and falling in love with Tina Fey. This is where the film nearly made me fall asleep. At that point, I started worrying and kept thinking 'Who approved of this deft, uneven script?' However, the last 10 minutes is where the film started to feel like it found its niche and at least passed for an entertaining action packed finale. It's like, there's a good 20 minutes of brilliance, an hour of boring filler, then 10 minutes of the brilliance that got the film off to a good start. As satisfied as I was that the film had a good last 10 minutes, 30 minutes out of 90 doesn't a good film make.It just seems like Dreamworks thought that they hit their mark with the stellar How To Train Your Dragon, found Universal was producing Despicable Me while someone had The Incredibles playing in the background and thought 'OMG GUYS. UNIVERSAL HAS A SWEET CONCEPT. LET'S SEE IF WE CAN DO IT AND RISE TO THEIR LEVEL OF Brilliance. OH AND LET'S BRING IN SOME STUFF FROM THE INCREDIBLES!!!' I crap you not. I got reminded several times of Despicable Me and The Incredibles, which is not a good thing. It just shows that they felt like they needed more money, so after doing what was said above, they'd release it as a sort of filler flick for their paychecks before KFP2 came out. Because they've gotta keep bringing in bucks by the buckets somehow. It also doesn't help that the equally mediocre Shrek Forever After had the same feel, despite being better than Shrek 3.To be fair, a lot of the movie has a 'going through the motions' feel to it. It seems like the writers got really lazy halfway into writing and went, 'Hey, we released a real sleeper hit this year!!! No need to be creative or make sure people find the jokes funny, we can turn our grocery shopping lists into a 3D movie and it'd be a smash!!!'. None of the jokes seem fresh. The plot seems bored and done a million times before. It just feels done, and I could have spent my money elsewhere.In short, Megamind is really just a boring movie, obviously released so Dreamworks can get more money. It just feels flat, tired, bored, done a million times before and even beautiful animation/good 3D cannot save this film from being the boring, convoluted mess it is. Skip it.Well, Pixar, it's safe to say you don't have to worry about your jobs anymore.",4,3,12,7 January 2011
Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street," The history of the world, my friend...
","I'll never forget the time I saw Sweeney in the theaters. Simply put, this is a PHENOMENAL movie. It is another Depp/Burton collaboration, and simply put, this is Burton's best film, Depp's best performance (he IS the movie), and simply put, the best movie I ever saw. And as a Sondheim/Stage Musical adaptation, you can't beat it.STORY: Benjamin Barker, who was falsely imprisoned for foolishness, comes back to London to find Judge Turpin, the man who stole his wife. In London, he lives with Nellie Lovett, a pie shop owner who has him set up a barbershop on the upper level. What really happens in the barbershop, is dark and secret- he kills people and Lovett bakes them into yummy meat pies (I want one of those pies!)! His main goal is to kill Turpin. Living with them is Toby, a young boy who's an alcoholic and doesn't know about their secrets...THOUGHTS: A STUNNING movie. Great music, amazing singing, and great Gothic visuals that add to the gloomy and dark feel to it. As a Dark Comedy, it works as well- for such a tragic movie, this has lots of Dark Comedy! I mean, some scenes will you'll laugh your butt off.OVERALL: You'll laugh, you'll cry, and you'll go 'ewwwww!'.An amazing movie, you will not regret seeing it!",10,3,4,18 May 2008
Horrible Bosses," Nothing 'horrible' here
","Admit it. You have, or at least have had, a boss that you wish would just frack off and die. As Jason Bateman's character correctly puts in the beginning of the film, 'the way you become successful is taking sh-t'. Well in Horrible Bosses, three lovable average ordinary men have taken too much sh-t, and have decided it's time for them to put some action in their lives. The results are only hilarious, and dark and twisty, making for a fun and hilarious dark comedy! I'll admit when I saw the trailer, I just thought this was a comedy about a bunch of people that hate their bosses, making it a passable black comedy at best. But imagine my surprise when the movie's twists came!First off, this is a smart black comedy. If you are expecting Observe And Report, which was another brilliant black comedy, you will be disappointed. This is very different.the first half of the film is where all the big laughs that you'd get in an Apatow production came. And there are plenty of laughs. The film manages to stay light and funny, even during the part where they conspire to kill their bosses and hire Motherf-cker Jones, played brilliantly by Jamie Foxx.And then the second half comes, and with just one scene, the movie takes a very dark turn. I was completely gob smacked. The film still manages to be funny, all while toying with your expectations. There is lots of black comedy in the second half, and boy does it work out well. Believe me, this is a fantastic movie. I dunno if I would say I'd place it on par with Bridesmaids, but it certainly better than that Hangover II garbage. The script is clever and twisty, and the humour is spot on, like any brilliantly written comedy. Whet makes this great is that for once it was actually WRITTEN, and it shows. Not like garbage like this year's abortion named Your Highness, where a large chunk was improvised. And for that, the movie works and is funny from beginning to end.Another great feature is the performances. One would expect with a cast like Kevin Spacey, Colin Farrell and Chris Day, for great performances. Foxx steals the show, in my opinion, but Spacey and Aniston were great too! Honestly, all involved were great. Bateman is charmingly brilliant too, as is Sudekis. And the ending, well let's just say it was one of the best I've seen in a long time!In short, this is one of the best movies of the year, and maybe the second best comedy of the year. Especially with all that garage like Pirates 4 and Super 8, this is one movie you cannot miss!Overall:10/10Pros: This film is consistently funny, dark, unexpected and overall will provide a great time for those willing to have their expectations completely defied!Cons: Tise expecting Apatow or a movie like Your Highness will be disappointed.",10,1,3,11 July 2011
Shutter Island," Well, crap on me, there's a murderer in the asylum or something
","Look guys, I do get it. The film is a study of insanity before a thriller/horror. Doesn't make it good. Furthermore, if you read the book you'd see my point.I read the book nearly a year before the film got released and I loved it. Quite possibly the most edge-of-your-seat book I read in a long time!!!! Furthermore when I saw the trailer and heard Scorsese would be doing the film adaptation I got ecstatic. Scorsese is one of the best filmmakers, and he directed my favorite film of 2006- The Departed. That movie was just spectacular, and it changed the way I saw movies forever. It blew my then-teenage mind, and I'll never forget the first time I saw it.So could tell, I was excited, and flocking to the theatre on opening day, I was ready to place this at the top of my list.The film is true to the book, yes. Is that a good thing? It depends. I was happy they stuck with the book, as basically it seemed like they used the book as the film's screenplay.However, I have the feeling that this would be a one star review if I hadn't read the book. For one, even my girlfriend, who hadn't read the book, knew the ending about 10 minutes in. The plot worked well in the book, but as a movie, just simply fails, again showing that not all books that are great make good movies. The movie is pretty alright, as it is lush and colorful in a few scenes and at times even seems like a Gothic horror film. Again, pretty pictures does not equal good movie.Another thing ruining the film is its 'punch in the face' musical score. Come on, the score was ridiculous. Spooky tingling piano music!!! Nazi-marching-into-town-music!!! LOUD BRASS music!!! Whoever did the score needs a kick in the teeth. The murder scene near the end was hilarious due to the inappropriate spooky tingling piano music.In short, honestly this film is pointless. I love Scorsese but this film just doesn't do anything for me. Skip it.",4,3,6,6 December 2010
Life of Pi," An empty candy wrapper
","Let's be honest here: Life of Pi is a pretty looking movie with a rather dismal plot, and a pretentious religious subtext thrown in there for good measure.Life of Pi might not be a bad movie. Realistically it would get maybe a 4 or 5 out of 10, but seeing as there's so many positive reviews here and all of them seem to be from either fanboys of the book, or people who haven't seen very many movies at all, I figured a 1 would be best to balance things out.No doubt the film has some humorous moments that are indeed very funny, like the tiger peeing in Pi's face, Pi's 'rules', and what not, and the film has tons of pretty visuals. A lot of the film takes place on a boat, and at times it looks like they used a real ocean to film it on. Not to mention the jellyfish scene was pretty, it was almost like James Cameron's Avatar. But... the plot is just so vapid and pretentious, it defies description. Basically, the film throws around a lot of religious references, and it takes up a good portion of the plot, but dear LORD most of the time, the religious references were as subtle as bricks in a drying machine. At times it's like the writers are smacking you across the face with a bible. And when he father asked Pi (as a child) early in the film 'how many more religions are you going to convert to?' (or something like that), I should have taken that as an indication as how the rest of the movie would be.Oh and the many random moments which included (but weren't limited to): the strange 2:35.1 Aspect ratio change where suddenly a bunch of fish start flying out of the water into the boat (including WINGED fish that seemed like a Michael Bay wet dream), a carnivorous island full of meerkats (though to be fair, the meerkats scene was like a cuteness overdose), and humpback whale bit. Yeah. There were parts of the film I enjoyed, but it honestly was just not a very good movie. It was like eating a platter full of candy and sugary sweets. Lots to indulge in and munch down on, but you've devoured nothing of substance by the end, and you're left with a stomach ache. And throwing a religious subtext in it doesn't mean the film is good or anything... It's just pretentious.So yeah, like I said. Realistically my rating would be a 4 or 5 out of 10, but the 8.4 rating and amounts of 10/10 reviews here is just ridiculous.",1,248,468,1 December 2012
Captain America: The First Avenger," He's the star spangled man with a plan
","If you've paid attention to the shape of cinema recently, you'd notice that we are sort of living in what we could call 'The Superhero Age' of cinema. Because starting in 2008, anticipation for the upcoming Avengers movie had started with the stellar flick Iron Man, with the mediocre Incredible Hulk following. Then, of course, in 2010 the just as spectacular as the first Iron Man 2 followed, with the credits holding a teaser for Thor, which would come out this year, with Captain America following just a few months later. That, plus Iron Man 2 held plenty of secrets regarding The Avengers.And so me, the comic book nerd I am, waited for every movie with great patience, and voila, they were all great... And believe me, Captain America is a fun as hell movie. While it may not be as great as Thor, it's still plenty of fun to be had, and it's overall a great time. I was initially worried before this though, because for one it was directed by Joe Johnston. And mind you, I've got nothing against the guy. In fact I gave a 5/5 review of his Wolfman remake. It's just that I was worried he couldn't pull it off, and he did it. Another thing is Chris Evans. I thought he was initially too much a bishonen to be convincing, and he surprisingly pulled it off. So in all, I was pleasantly surprised!The movie, like Iron Man and Thor before it, is more of an origin story. It takes place in 1942 during the second world war, and Steve Richards, a small and skinny shotaro boy with a laundry list of medical problems, has been dying to join the American army, to help serve, and fight for his country. He has been unsuccessful in every attempt, and furthermore, he is completely jealous of his buddy, who is already in the army. One night, he manages to successfully get in, thanks to the help of a German doctor Abraham Erskine, although it isn't without difficulty in training. However, the handsome and smart, not to mention very tech savvy Howard Stark has a plan for him: a serum that will give him a he'll of a physique, amazing strength, and furthermore turns him into the super soldier under the name Captain America. After this procedure, the transformation into Captain America begins, as he manages to do many things, such as free imprisoned soldiers from the jaws of death, somehow manage to make the smokin' hot British army general Peggy Carter fall for him, and get on the road to overthrowing the evil German doctor Johan Schmitt, who has terrifying plans for the war.So really, let's begin with the fact that the 3D was surprisingly great. I wasn't going to bother since it was filmed in 2D and converted in post, but reading CinemaBlend's review of the 3D and further research that Joe Johnston had 3D in mind from the very early stages and carefully shot each scene for the 3D convinced me. And yes, it is totally worth it. While it's no Avatar or TRON Legacy, this is the best post conversion I've seen since Piranha 3D. Very few films shot in 3D looked better than this, and that's saying something. Maybe I'm over exaggerating, but if this is a sign of things to come for the current boom of 3D, maybe post conversions in the future could look as great as TRON Legacy or Avatar. So yes, do go for 3D!As for the film itself, wow. Great performances abounds in the film. I wasn't expecting Chris Evans to be as great as he was, and boy did he thrill. He had great comedic timing, looked the part, played the role just the way you'd expect Captain America to be played. Tommy Lee Jones was great too, and so was Dominic Cooper as Howard Stark. The script is very intelligent and filled with humour, action, and great dialogue too. The action as well, is simply amazing! Why can't all action movies be well shot, with camera shots lasting longer than a few seconds? Transformers, despite 3D, still has the quick shots syndrome, so thankfully the action here did not disappoint.Another surprise is the use of CG is very limited- thank god! The thing about Joe Johnston is that he's been known to use CG sparingly, mixing CG with practical effects. As you could imagine, this film takes place during World War II, and not on Asgard, as well as it doesn't have a man in an iron suit, so for the most part, the effects are practical and in camera. However, when he does use CG, you almost don't notice it, it's that well used. So I gotta say, it's great that we have a blockbuster that makes use of mostly practical effects. Maybe it's just my inner child speaking, as I grew up with a man in a suit playing Chewbacca, or people holding the doors open on the Enterprise to give it the sliding illusion, or Keanu Reeves sitting on a train writing his journal with a map of Europe projected on his face, but I was pleased with this.If I had one complaint, it's that the movie is slow in a few parts, but that is just a teensy quibble. Otherwise, this movie is a fantastic blockbuster, and a sign of things to come for the Avengers. A total recommend, and I also advise you to stay after the credits, as there's a teaser for The Avengers!Overall: 8/10Pros: Captain America is a surprisingly very great superhero action flick, with awesome action and performances by Hugo Weaving and Chris Evans. It also looks great in 3D and makes awesome use of practical effects.Cons: it is slow in the middle, and Dominic Cooper's underuse is just a teensy bit disappointing.",7,5,11,31 July 2011
Incendies," A lovely looking and acted film, in desperate need of a script
","Forgive me for being the on person who stood out among the crowd here, but by God I really can't see how this has an 8.2 rating here on IMDb. Now I can see that this would be loved to death by those who only watch 'film' and not movies, but come on, folks. I do like Denis Villanueve... Or at least I did. I saw his movie Polytechnique and I loved it. It was brutal, uncompromising yet very heartfelt and uplifting. I loved the black and white cinematography, as well as the feeling of being caught in the middle of the shooting. His filmmaking is just lovely in that film. So with hi expectations already in place, I was hoping this would do the good deed.Alright, from a filmmaking standpoint, as in cinematography and all that jazz, the movie is amazing. If I could give the movie a 10 for that alone, I so would. With all the gorgeous scenery and what not, this film really is pleasing to the eye. And the soundtrack is fantastic too, with 'You and whose Army' by Radiohead over the opening scene- I LOVED that! And the acting is really brilliant, Maxim Gaudette and the female lead both did very great together.But how shallow was this film.The biggest problem is its characterization. Characters go a long way in a film for me, and believe me I wanted to feel for the mother and her children. I'll admit they did quite well with the mother, and the scenes with the flashbacks to her past were very intriguing. But them we went to present day with the kids, and the daughter in her mother's homeland, and suddenly the film goes all to naught because the children are SO DAMNED UNINTERESTING. In fact I don't remember a thing about the son because he was in the movie for like, literally, 5 minutes. Another problem is the script... If there even is one.. The movie feels like Villanueve dropped the script one day, then picked it up and instead of putting the pages in the right order, went 'Ah, never mind, shoot it like this!' The dialogue is so wooden and hokey, that at times I fell on the ground laughing at the implausibility. In fact scene. After scene, I was scratching my head because the scenes have no meaning. And don't get me started on the twist with the third child, when that came, I asked myself 'was this some bad joke the cast and crew had going on throughout the shoot?'I wish I could jump on the bandwagon like a lot of us here have, but the movie is so dire, tired and dull. And furthermore it's 30 minutes too long too. This is a 90 minute or even a 100 minute movie stretched to 2 hours and 10 minutes. It did not need to be that long.OVERALL: 3/10Pros: A very beautifully shot movie, with great acting and soundtrack.Cons: The film is otherwise very shallow, with an almost zero level script, bad pacing, and dull and shallow characters.",3,44,100,29 July 2011
Oblivion," Rule number one of Oblivion: You do not talk about Oblivion.
","Second rule of Oblivion: You do not talk about Oblivion.Alright, I hate to rip off the excellent Fight Club, but I felt that really sums up the film perfectly. Because it's impossible to talk about this film without really spoiling it; as I was telling my parents about it last night after having gone to see an matinÃ©e IMAX showing with my sister, I found myself having to hold back. Basically, you can only give them a description of what happens in the trailer and not spoil it. So while the fact that I'm trying to write a review of a film that's full of stuff which can't be given away may seem like an impossible task, what I can tell you is that this is simply a must see film.Joseph Kosinski's sophomore film effort after the stellar TRON: Legacy was a passion project of him since 2005; when Kosinski moved to Los Angeles looking for film/music video projects, he kept himself sane by writing an 8-page story about Jack Harper, a drone repairman in a post-apocalyptic New York. While writing it, he listened then- unknown French electronic musician Anthony 'M83' Gonzales. For 6 years he tried to get the film made, and now it's finally here. And it's not a film for everyone, based on the reactions to it: some people will not like it, some people will love it, and some will be left wondering what to think about it. But one thing we can agree on is that it is one of the most ambitious films of the year, and maybe even in a long time. Shooting the film with Sony CineAlta cameras and having M83 score the film just adds to the cleverness of the film- for one, the film looks and sounds ahead of its time. M83's score is reminiscent of Hans Zimmer and Mike Oldfield with a futuristic twist, and the cinematography is nothing short of gorgeous. In particular, the pool scene looks like a pretty screen saver. It's wonderful.Right from the first frames of Oblivion, one can tell that it's a lot more intimate than most blockbusters out there. Same can be said for the opening bits where Jack Harper gets his plane ready and his wife sits in the control tower and sets base up. It definitely seems grand and epic, but at the same time, we're getting a lot more of an up-close- and-personal portrait of a couple paired together after a war that caused a huge disaster worldwide. Throughout much of the film we follow Jack as he repairs drones for the big robotic guardian in the sky named TET, and maintains the stability of the apocalyptic wasteland that is New York. He is almost always surrounded by danger, whether in the form of stray dogs or people dressed in creepy looking suits that resemble the creatures from the film 'Predator'. He does, at one point, notice a ship crashing and rescues a survivor, who seems to be hidden in his dreams a lot. From there on things get a lot stranger, and that's where I can stop telling you about the general gist of the film.Â I'll admit that I was a tad disappointed that the trailer gave away a lot of what happens in the film, and so if you have only seen the one trailer, I'd definitely recommend you leave it at that. Because the rest of the movie has lots of shocking twists and turns; great character changes and lots of secrets that will definitely surprise you. Of course, the buildup to the big climax at the end gets greater and greater as it goes on, and the payoff is ultimately very satisfying and emotional. Of course I do have a few small gripes about the film- the finish definitely seems a bit rushed, the film definitely seems familiar at times (with obvious plot elements from The Giver, Minority Report and The Book of Eli), and Â a little more development of Jack's little hideout wouldn't have hurt, but overall, the film was really a stellar sophomore effort from Joseph Kosinski, and definitely will get itself a much deserved cult following. I can definitely imagine it being a film that will benefit from multiple viewings. The performances are excellent, especially from Tom Cruise and Emily Blunt, who at times seems just plain creepy. The story is very thought provoking and will definitely leave you thinking about it long after the film is over, and the score is nothing short of stellar, and deserves to be heard on its own.So by all means, see it, and recommend it to your friends and family. But like I said, do not, by any means, give anything away for them.",9,2,4,21 April 2013
Watchmen," Zack Snyder's Masterpiece
","Seeing this in the theater on opening day was probably one of the greatest movie experiences in a lifetime. It's unfortunate that this movie had a 75% drop in its theatrical run after a successful opening, but not every movie is #1 5 weeks in a row, right? Watchmen is based on a graphic novel by Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons. It's a very well done adaptation. I've read the graphic novel twice, so I was excited to see this movie.And what an awesome movie it was! I was a bit skeptical about the almost 3-hour length (I don't have A.D.D), but in the end I was completely satisfied. I saw it with 3 people who hadn't read the graphic novel, and they even loved it too. I was very shocked though that there were kids at this movie, as if the rating 18A for 'Gory Scenes, Brutal Violence' wasn't enough of a warning? The year is 1985. Nuclear War is a high threat. The doomsday clock has been set to 5 minutes to midnight. And an ex-superhero has been murdered. The Comedian (played by Jeffrey Dean Morgan), has been thrown out a window to his death. Upon this happening, the minutemen, now called the Watchmen, a washed-up ex-ensemble of superheroes has reunited to to one thing- save the world from nuclear threat.Watchmen is a brilliant movie. At 2 hours and 43 minutes it doesn't overstay its welcome. In fact I actually didn't want it to end. The entire cast was brilliant. The movie isn't as humorless as everyone says it is, there's lots of dry humor where appropriate, there is lots of action, and another thing is that it fits the 'problems of society' feel that the comic created. Also the omissions were not as bad as people are exaggerating it to be- I must admit I liked the changed ending a lot better than the book ending. It's more realistic, and I must admit the book ending made me go 'WTF'.I shall warn you though, this movie is very violent and gory. I am a gorehound, and I found myself cringing and going 'Ewwwwww' at a few bits. Do not see this if you are squeamish, because it IS very brutal and gruesome stuff.So overall, I have not one single complaint about this film, because it's an amazing work of art. This is brutal and and gruesome stuff that if hard to watch, and I love it. Consider it Snyder's masterpiece! I can't wait to get it on Blu-Ray when it comes out!",5,3,8,5 May 2009
Man of Steel," Snyder and Nolan have officially both ruined Superman for me
","Please bear in mind that I am a fan of both Zack Snyder and Christopher Nolan. I'll spend pretty much every day until my terminal breath defending Sucker Punch and Snyder's Watchmen adaptation. Nolan's work with the Batman movies is nothing short of absolutely amazing and he has one eye for a tragic superhero story. He turned the story of Bruce Wayne into a beautiful tragic story of a man who must choose heroism or sanity. Watchmen is the story of former superheroes who realize that even though they're retired, they have a lot of saving to do- themselves for a starting point. And so when you take Superman and give it a dark spin, it's bound to succeed, right?Absolutely wrong.Alright, so maybe the movie isn't bad. If you're a pedestrian viewer wanting an explosion filled action movie, then you'll get that here. But for us Superman fans, it's a disgrace. I don't know who these 'fans' are telling us that this is close to the graphic novels, in fact the way they adapted the comics is among some of the most appalling adapting work I've ever seen. There are problems right off the bat when Jor-El is stabbed to death by General Zod. REALLY? If anyone has even read the comic books, you'd realize that Jor-El is much stronger and more defensive than that. But it doesn't stop thereTo begin with, the Superman is greatly raped with a stove pipe and executed Tarantino- style throughout. He spends the whole movie angsting and whining. It's as annoying as The Tenth Doctor's final episode of Doctor Who. Alright, that's a little dramatic, sure. But half the exchanges between Clark Kent and people around him consist of:PERSON X: Clark, can we talk? CLARK: I don't want to. PERSON X: Look Clark, nothing is wrong with you. CLARK: I know. PERSON X: so why don't you send your powers to the world? CLARK: No, you don't understand. People CAN'T know who I am. They'll reject me.Every time one of these rubbish soap opera dialogues rung out over the cinema speakers, I groaned. To be fair, it is SLIGHTLY true to the comics, but they take it up to 11 here and it's unnecessary. The cutting of the film is really off here too. One minute, Superman is being interrogated, the next he's in the desert. It comes off as if Snyder dropped the script on the ground one day thus messing up the pages, then decided, 'ah, never mind, let's just shoot it like this'. Your head will explode trying to make sense of this thing, man.And then there's the second half, filled with nothing but action, explosions, Superman pushing General Zod through several buildings (I laughed several times). The action itself is bloated, boring and incomprehensible too. Shaky camera and quick cutting combined with 3D, when I wasn't falling asleep, I was wondering what in the hot frak was going on. And then the climax, or lack of was just laughable.So, are there any positives? Well, the cast do a good job. I did like Henry Cavill a lot and I think given the terrible script that he had to work with, he did a decent job. Diane Lane and Kevin Costner are also great, but the highlight of the film is easily Michael Shannon as General Zod. He really knows how to make a bad guy scary- watch the film 'Bug' for proof. But he shines here and he plays the villain in such a way that you both feel bad for him and hate him at the same time, which is proof of a well executed villain. Otherwise, stay away from this turkey at all costs. Don't believe the positive reviews, the critics are right for once. I figured it was just the unhealthy and unfair hate-on they have for Snyder, but nope. They're right. I'm guessing WB hired plants to write reviews, because a lot of the reviews do seem very much vague. This film will ruin everything you love about Superman, so avoid at all cost.",5,107,207,19 June 2013
The Village," 'What a tweeeeest'
","Instead of dragging it out with paragraphs, I'll just list off PLENTY of the things that made this film a complete turd.-So a guy manages to (somehow) get a forest preserve, and (somehow) prevents planes from flying over it. Because it would be out of place in making the kids believe that they live in an 1800s time period. Really, Night??? -I have the most brilliant idea!!!! Let's send the blind girl to get the medicine! She's SO gonna know where she's going!!! -Somehow the blind girl manages to take down the 'thing they don't mention' or whatever they call it. And she's so sharp she knows where it is!!!! She even heads towards it in a straight line in some bits of the showdown!!! -Let's also mention that she's SOOOOO blind, she runs at breakneck speed in the forest and manages to avoid falling into a LARGE HOLE and bumping into all the trees around her!!! And then of course, she manages to get out of the village which is protected by a huge fence!!! -So the little society of theirs is supposed to be free of violence and/or crime. Yet they set up this little scheme to scare the kids, and set up this retarded 'Red is the forbidden colour' rule??? Excuse me for a moment, I may be a little while on this one.-On the topic of the 'red' rule, major plot hole. For one, let's mention that the film is set in the Autumn. The leaves are red clearly, that's a problem. What about red berries on the trees? Or the CLEARLY RED CURTAINS in one of the scenes. EPIC FAIL!!!! -Basically, if these adults were as smart as they thought they were, they'd have realized their whole 'society' didn't work, with all the death and killing around them (and not to mention the slaughter of the animals to make the monster suits) -The whole 'scaring the kids with pig suits' thing doesn't work either. For one, Noah is the mentally insane dude, and at the end when the twist was revealed (major cop-out too), he was one of them. And they'd be dumb enough to hide a suit under the floorboards in the village loonie bin????? -Also, with nothing in the loonie bin, how on earth did Noah break the floorboards to get the suit and then escape??? I'd list more, but it'd be too long for the page.",1,0,2,14 October 2010
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1," Exactly how it should be: sexy, gritty, dark and fun
","I'm one of the many who absolutely loved the last film, The Half Blood Prince. IMO, it's a long book, but David Yates did what he could and gave us a fairly solid adaptation. And so it goes, we're at the end of the movie series. It's not a pleasant feeling knowing that we're at the end, but it's been a hell of a ride! And dare I say it, Hallows part one is definitely the best film since Goblet of Fire! Of course, there was much controversy upon the news of the finale being split in two, and I'll admit I was one of the 'TWO movies? [...] that' crowd, but after doing some thinking, I realized it's a long book and so much important stuff happens, so after all, it's only reasonable. And I waited. And waited. And then, the showtimes for opening night got released, and I found that it was playing in the new Canadian projection system AVX, with wall to wall screen, rocker seats and crystal clear image and sound. So I went after work, a week early too, to go get my ticket, and awaited opening day.Needless to say, this movie did not disappoint.I was surprised at the amount of material that was covered. It was more of 75% of the book in a 146-Minute movie, and so I was pleased. This movie is also startlingly different from the other ones too. As expected, and shown in the books, the dark level rose with every book, and as seen in the trailers, this would be the darkest and grittiest. And my friends, it is just that, and thankfully so too. This basically strips away the glossiness of the others and gives us a rough, gritty, raw, disturbing and depressing feel/visual palette.Also, I normally detest shaky camera, as it looks ridiculous, gives me a headache and looks like someone with Parkinson's shot it. But here, it was used in the best way possible!!!! It actually added to the raw feel of the film, and suited the movie's dark tones well too. I was actually floored at how well done the shaky camera was, and furthermore, just how well done the film was.In short, I walked out tickled pink and happy, because this is the Harry Potter I asked for, and I got. I am absolutely stoked for part two. Bravo, David Yates! Bravo!!!",10,0,1,11 March 2011
The Hills Have Eyes," A chilling horror masterpiece that will make your blood run cold!
","In 1977, the Wes Craven classic 'The Hills Have Eyes' scared people to death and gave people nightmares. 19 years later it was remade under the same name, except this time, it's Scarier! The 2006 update of The Hills Have Eyes is just as good as, if not even better than the original.Here we have an entire cast of unknowns, and that's a good thing. In the beginning, we see a group of scientists collecting chemicals, when a mutant kills them, and drags their 4 bodies by car. Then we focus on a family driving through the New Mexico desert to visit family from out-of-town. A quarter of the way there, their tires are flattened and they are stuck. They decide to stay in the desert until their problem is fixed. What they DON'T know is that they are being watched by a group of deadly mutants, who terrorize them all night long! THHE is a great movie. Definitely not for those with a weak stomach and contains lots of hardcore blood and gore. Totally recommended if you liked the original!",6,1,2,27 June 2008
Kung Fu Panda 2," A sequel with real kick
","I guess I will have to make a confession that will get the Dreamworks crowd all worked up: while I enjoyed Kung Fu Panda, I'm not one of the many who hold it up on as high a pedestal as the superior Monsters Vs. Aliens or the movie that may be the epitome of all things cute, How to Train Your Dragon. So nail me to the cross if you want. I also have, in recent times, developed a distaste for sequels. This year we had Pixar's first terrible movie (Cars 2), the disastrously messy Pirates 4, and the carbon copy Hangover 2 (though Deathly Hallows Part 2 is my pick for top movie of 2011) So while I, as I stated, enjoyed KFP1, I initially had low expectations for it's sequel in place. And with that in mind, I can say I enjoyed Kung Fu Panda 2. Although it's not perfect, it managed to be very entertaining, and a worthy follow up. The sequel takes place some time after the first movie. Po has continued training to be a true Kung Fu master, but there's one thing he hasn't yet truly mastered: inner peace. Of course, to a panda like Po, Kung Fu is all about kicking butt, but he soon learns that the only way to be a true Kung Fu master is to be at peace with himself. However, a new gang, sent in by a Peacock who seems a ghost of Po's past, has terrorized the village, sending Po and the gang on an adventure to stop him.Kung Fu Panda 2 works... for the most part. The good news is, it overall provides for an entertaining ride that the whole family can enjoy. The script is filled with tons of funny lines that are bound to have the kids repeating them for hours on end. As well as the voice cast is just as charming this time around; Jack Black still manages to charm as Po, Angelina Jolie still manages to put her street tough kick to good use. However, Gary Oldman, as usual, steals the show. He makes a great villain and it shows.The animation also manages to dazzle. I can safely say that the animation quality has come a long way since Shrek. I didn't see this in 3D, but I guarantee I would have loved to. There are a lot of moments in the animation where I wanted to reach out and run my fingers through Po's fur, or move my hand along the cannon near the end, and had I seen this movie in 3D, I probably would have reached out and tried to feel them! It reminded me of when I saw Sanctum in 3D earlier this year, where I felt like I was actually underwater.However there are a few flaws that prevent me from calling it a perfect film, let alone near perfect. For starters, it took me a while to be able to connect with the movie, as the pacing unfortunately is rushed to the point where it moves at a machine gun pace. Thepacing does slightly slow down in the middle but even then, the film still feels like the filmmakers were trying to cram too much in. Also, the story seemed convoluted. There was a story but it was rushed, to the point where I had myself questioning halfway through the film what the movie was about. Overall, Kung Fu Panda 2 is a very enjoyable film that is not without it's flaws. I would say go into it with an open mind, and don't expect Pixar level entertainment. Oh, and even if you don't go to movies for the actors, it's still worth seeing for Gary Oldman alone.Overall: 7/10Pros: The film provides good action, humour, laughs, alongside a stellar voice cast, a terrific Hans Zimmer score and beautiful animation that would convince even 3D sceptics to buy a ticket.Cons: The film's pacing is rushed, to the near point of being disorienting, as well as the story could have been more fleshed out as well as the villain.",7,1,2,23 July 2011
Hugo," Come and dream with me
","It may seem odd that a movie about the magic of cinema, in an age where cinema proved itself to be more than just a fad, the 1920s, would be made utilizing 3D, a gimmick that seems to be all the rage today. This gets lampshaded by one particular scene, where the audience watches a scene where a train pulls into a station and flips out, as they think the train is coming for them. Yet, given the subject matter, it only seems inevitable that a man like Martin would think up such an idea for such a plot, anyway.Based off the book 'The Invention of Hugo Cabret', which is a stunning mix of hand drawings and writing, and set in 1920s Paris, the film 'Hugo' tells the story of Hugo Cabret, a young orphan who works and lives in the clock tower of a train station, which is ruled by a ruthless inspector, and is also where he has been stealing several toys for their parts to fix a broken automaton, made for the movies of Georges Méilès. One day, when caught trying to steal a toy, the owner notices Hugo's notebook, which contains conceptual sketches for the automaton, and steals it, to which Hugo tries to get back.But Hugo instead meets Uncle Georges' adoptive daughter, who helps him try to get the notebook back. But through all this, they both end up in the mystery surrounding the automaton, and movies. Isabelle hasn't seen a movie, and after a stint in a cinema, they find out that film itself is what keeps drawing them closer and closer in this spider's web... and so begins an adventure for the two where they discover themselves, the joy of movies, and the need to stick together in the face of adversity.Wow... What a film. Honestly, I don't think I've seen a movie like this at all. I always knew you could count on Marty to blow your mind, and here he really has outdone himself. I was left speechless after the movie- honestly I don't think I've been left with that feeling in ages.Everything about this movie is just brilliant. First, the acting is STELLAR. Asa Butterfield plays the titular character so heartbreakingly beautifully. He puts so much pain and emotion into his performance that it's as mesmerizing as it is heartbreaking. He is a great actor with the eyes too, and he really showed it here... Every melancholy expression of his had me on the verge of tears (and I'm a very manly guy!!!). Moertz... Well, we knew she was amazing when we saw her in Kick-Ass!, and she is especially brilliant here. Cohen is his usual funny self, let's face it: he was made for the comic roles. He does brilliantly here. But best of all is Kingsley... Oh man. Word to all directors ever: if you don't want your audience reduced to sobbing messes, never have Ben Kingsley play a broken old man, ever. We all know he's an amazing actor. But here, he gives his most devastatingly beautiful performance ever. I cried in a few places, he is that phenomenal.The plot? Well, you knew already it's great. But my synopsis does not do it justice, believe me. Absolutely beautifully done.The cinematography is perfect, and the 3D is amazing. This is the best 3D I've seen in any movie, ever. It helps tell the story, for once- it helps a movie about the magic of filmmaking, that should say something. This must be seen in a 3D cinema, I mean that. Every single detail is exposed, there's several moments where its like you're looking through a window. I think Scorsese made a wise choice to shoot in 1:85.1, too. That helped give the movie the old timey feel it aimed for. I will definitely add this film to my Blu ray collection, even if it's just to show off my HD equipment for family members visiting in the future.And another thing- the feel of the movie is perfect. This is a film made for us who go to a movie to immerse ourselves in it. To escape from reality and indulge in this world being brought forth to us. Not since TRON: Legacy have we gotten a film as magical as that, and I did not want this movie to end at all.In short, do not miss this film. If you're tired of brainless blockbusters and dialogue driven movies that turn them into videotaped plays, and want a film that sums up why we go to the cinema, see this movie. You will regret having missed it, if you don't, and that I guarantee.Bravo, Scorsese. You have re-proved yourself as a favourite filmmaker of mine.OVERALL: 10/10THE GOOD: Everything!THE BAD: ...the fact that it had to end. :(",10,12,20,3 December 2011
The White Ribbon," Oh, get off your high horses guys...
","I'm no stranger to Michael Haneke's movies, especially when it comes to the ones that have often gotten much attention. Haneke is a very interesting person; however it also goes without saying that I have only seen one movie of his that I enjoyed: The Piano Teacher. What was great like that was its suspense buildup and its dark comedy. There are some scenes wher eyou don't know if you should be horrified or humored (BTW people, Haneke even said it himself that he looks at the movie as a Dark Comedy).However, Of all the movies I've seen (the mentioned PT, alongside Cache, Funny Games US, White Ribbon and Seventh Continent), I've only really enjoyed PT. I find the trouble with Haneke is that his movies, while they aim for something, end up making Haneke someone who hates his audience. For example, Funny Games, a movie I despised, tried to get the 'Kids, violence is bad, mmkay?' message across, but ended up beating the pish out of the audience with it. It's almost as if he has no respect for his audience, and like my dad always said, 'Difference doesn't equal talent'.The White Ribbon, while being slightly better than the average Haneke movie, is unfortunately a hair different than the rest. What managed to keep me interested was its gorgeous B&W cinematography; it was very creepy brooding. However, the film's snail pace and shallow story prevents it from getting anywhere, and in the end, the film relies on its gorgeous cinematography to carry on for two and a half almost pointless hours.Basically here we have an interesting concept- taking place in a town in pre-WWI Germany, a series of disturbing happenings including an (overly fake and CG'ed) accident which happens at the beginnng. More disturbing crimes keep happening, and nobody will admit to doing it, which leads to resentment towards the town leaders. More accidents keep happening and people still don't know who is responsible; though it is hinted at times that the Children could be the people in charge.This sounds interesting. That's what I thought before entering the theatre. However, since most of the accident scenes are simply implied, the movie's mystery becomes harder and harder to follow. What is even more frustrating is how Haneke ends the movie without even providing a proper resolution. But while that worked for 'The Piano Teacher' because it left the viewer with a sense of foreboding, here it just leaves the viewer angered.In short, this movie was a mediocre way to spend 140 minutes, which felt longer, and while Haneke may be making art, art is as art does and the movie does very little. In short, it's a very grand argument in style over substance, though I guess would be recommend worthy for its B&W visuals.",2,17,45,10 March 2011
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," Wasted potential
","For those of you who have been out of the loop re the Millennium series recently, it was announced as far back as January 2010 that Fincher would be attached to the American Dragon Tattoo film. This sparked a mixed reaction, from people who even love Fincher like there's no tomorrow. Well, it looks like people are still high off their wankery over The Social Network, another mediocre and spectacularly overrated movie. So it seems obvious the circle jerk would continue in the wake of the recent Dragon Tattoo adaptation.Problem is, there seems to be Two David Finchers. The one who made amazing movies Like Se7en, The Game, Fight Club, Panic Room and The Zodiac. Then there's the Fincher who gave us the horrid Benjamin Button, the overrated above mentioned Social Network, and now this.Thing is, I for one wasn't too opposed the idea of an English language adaptation. I mean, sure it wouldn't be as authentic as the original Swedish version, nor the book. But it could still work. Craig still had the face and Mara has very striking facial features. Reznor has a unique way of scoring a film, and Fincher has a great eye for a shot, hell, he practically made a whole career our of that kind of thing.Unfortunately, the movie is nowhere near as interesting as the Swedish movie. And here's why.The Swedish movie does a good job at staying close to the source material, however, it doesn't just mindlessly piggyback off of the source material- it perfectly balanced everything out. Those who haven't read the book would be able to follow it and find it entertaining. It took its time too- it had a nice, steady, easy going pace. It was 2.5 hours, but the movie was so interesting, it went by fast and you couldn't tell.The Yank version is pretty much an exact adaptation of the book, yes. Pretty much 98% of the book was in the movie. That's NOT a good thing; to me it came off as nothing more than desperate to please the fans. It was like Zallian said 'Alright, we have to mindlessly piggyback the book. I'm super scared of pissing the fans off, and so let's not edit anything down. There is no such thing as 'What may work on page doesn't necessarily work on film.''. Except... there is.Let me explain why.Niels' film showed RESTRAINT and SUBTLETY, the two things this film lacked. It focused more on the characters than every single tiny little plot device of the book. This film felt rushed and blew its way through everything. For example, the opening scene. In Niels' film, it's very powerful. The way he looks at the plant then breaks down is simply... stunning. Here? We got a half assed phone call and a shot of the plant.The opening credits, however, are class. Pointless, overly flashy and a bit gimmicky? Yes, but class, and the images fit very nicely over the Immigrant Song. I loved the shout outs to the sequels too.Unfortunately it stops there, the writer Zallian is so obsessed with capturing every event that he senselessly skips over CHARACTER DETAILS!!!!! We get no hint to the fact that Lisbeth is possibly autistic. Instead we get a scenery chewing girl who we want to punch in the face every time we see her. The whole libel thing goes over our heads completely too.And that's just the beginning.Several of the scenes are over before they even begin. It's frustrating. The rape scene was underwhelming even. In the book it was a disturbing and powerful scene. Here it's just a 'lol wut' moment.As for the acting. Noomi Rapace simply cannot be replaced. She played Lisbeth exactly how the books describe her. Tough as nails, arrogant, and dangerous to herself, but with an air of special childlike innocence. Mara? She confuses good acting for chewing the scenery. She always glares and says every line like someone asked her the square root of an insanely large number. Nyqvist not only played Blomkvist just like Larsson wrote him, but he also LOOKED like the book described. Here, Craig just seems to be stuck in his Bond phase. Nothing special whatsoever.Also, for parts 2 and 3, someone needs to hire a better dialect coach. I lost count of all the times they went from American to British to a Europeanoid accent. What a joke.I wish I could recommend this, but it's a big mess. Avoid if you haven't watched the Swedish and just watch that instead.Fincher, thou hast ruined Lisbeth Salander for me.",3,29,51,24 December 2011
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," WOW!!!! Did we all watch the same movie... or better yet, read the same book?
","1. Not only is the scene where Harry receives the broomstick not in the beginning, but we see Harry practicing magic under his bedsheets. As shown by the second movie/book, practicing magic is not allowed outside Hogwarts. WTF? It's like they want me to hate the movie already.2. We don't find out how Ron's family got the money to go on vacation.3. The Firebolt takes too long to appear. WTF???? AT THE END???? 4.Dementors flying???? In the book(s), they do nothing more but hover above the ground. The same thing happens in the 5th movie, just as annoying.5. The knight bus scenes were WAY overdone and too wacky. And the shrinking head was just cringe worthy.6. Quidditch players do not have numbers on the uniforms.7. Also is it me or did Hogwarts look really small??? Compared to the first two movies where it looked grand and epic. Major effects/design fail.8. Pettigrew is supposed to be short and stubby, not taller than Sirius.9. Gryffindor winning the Quidditch cup is not shown.10. The punching scene was so overdone. Without the line from Herminone it just feels like a run of the mill scene in any movie with a girl punching a guy. And the clichéd 'That felt good' line just crowned it.11. The Shrieking Shack. First off it's not SMALL. It's supposed to be HUGE. Secondly that scene ended before it even began. It reminds me of the ministry of magic scenes in OOTP where it was reduced from many rooms into one giant room.12. WHERE IS CADOGAN???? Without him the entire movie didn't make sense!!! That's like cutting Aragorn from Lord of the Rings!!!! 13. The whole film just felt really rushed, like they were focusing more on the action as opposed to the important scenes in the book.14. The best thing about this is that at least Cuaron won't be directing another Harry Potter movie.This just hurt my soul. Thankfully Newell redeemed the series with the best yet, Goblet of Fire.",1,5,15,11 November 2010
The Amazing Spider-Man," I'm speechless...
","I'll admit I was a tad skeptical about the movie. Not in a bad way, but I was unsure if the series really needed a reboot. Sure the third movie sucked, but to have seen a follow-up to it would have been a good idea. However, after seeing an advance screening of this movie in IMAX 3D tonight, I Rescind all my doubts.No, really. This movie is spectacular. Everything about it was just... Awesome. In fact, if anything, the Raimi movies don't really interest me anymore, no matter how much I loved SM2. I know that's a bold statement to make, but seriously, this film fixes everything wrong with the Raimi movies, and is definitely more than just an apology for Spider Man 3.For one, it all starts with the tone. From the opening scene where Peter gets ready for a game of Hide and Seek, there's shades of Nolan's Batman movies in it. Throughout the movie there is an air of neo-noir, in a similar fashion to 'Drive'- even the score hints to a bit of a film noir feel. It suits the film because if anything this is an origin story before a superhero movie. The dark and gritty tone still stays consistent throughout, even in the action scenes.The story might not be totally original but it all comes down to how they handle it, and they sure handle it well. How Peter finds the clues to an unfinished experiment in Uncle Ben's flooded basement, and how he manages to piece the algorithm together with Curtis Connors. They do a good job of balancing out the origin story and the action, I dare say! And the chemistry between Gwen and Peter was very believable too. They didn't devote too much time to the love story, which is always a good thing. The contrast between Peter and Curtis is fantastic as well, and if anything is one of the better hero/villain chemistry works in recent years.As for the action scenes? INCREDIBLE. I must say, I love how they kept them grounded and realistic,saving the epic sweep until the big finale. They scrapped the campy and over the top feel of the original movies and give us rough and brutal fights, just how we want it. Garfield handles the action well and you can tell he did a lot of his own stunts too. The fight scenes between Spider Man and Lizard were fantastic, especially the grand finale in the Oscorp tower at the end!And the acting. I must say the acting was fantastic. Garfield KNOCKED IT OUT OF THE PARK, here. MacGuire was too much of a metrosexual pansy for me to take him seriously. Garfield is a total nerd, and as a result, he gets the role right. He even looks nerdy, and it helps as well. The way he manages to hold back his British accent is extraordinary as well, and his humorous kick he adds to the character works too. Emma Stone is fantastic as Gwen Stacy and adds real depth to the character, in an almost unexpected way. Her and Peter Parker's chemistry works on every level. Ifans is a great villain, and he manages to add an air of sympathy to the villain, making his transformation into the Lizard very tragic and poignant. And Leary... Well, what can we say? Brilliant and funny as usual, he even ad libs a few lines, and you'll know which lines those are ('do I look like the mayor of Tokyo?!').In short, Webb, Stone, Garfield and Ifans have knocked one out of the park. An absolutely stellar effort thanks to great talent and I can assure you that I  will be seeing the movie again. And I can also assure you that this is a must see, with tons of action, intrigue, humour and dark tone as well. Do not miss it!",4,7,16,28 June 2012
Goon," Like its main character, Goon can't seem to get its head in the game
","I assume every Canadian knows the age-old joke by now: 'I went to a fight the other night, and a hockey game broke out.' I, myself, am not a fan of hockey, so I guess it's my own fault for going into movie thinking I'd like it, but I'll admit a Canadian film with Scott and Schreiber in it had me sold. I even paid the extra $8 to experience the most nauseating D-Box experience of my life. Ouch.Goon is supposedly based on a true story of a fighter who was trained to skate and be a hockey player, and was famous for sucking at hockey but beating the snot out of his opponents. Except, just replace the word 'fighter' with 'bouncer', and you have the 95 minute exercise in idiocy that is Goon, a comedy so depressingly boring. it's essentially Moneyball with tons of blood and gore, and without the classy charm.The first 20 minutes of the movie were gloriously entertaining. The opening fight scene on ice and the bloody tooth falling on the ice. That was brilliant. When we're introduced to the Main character is where the film starts getting slightly weak, however. So, you're telling me this guy is all adorkable and awkward, yet he has no problem beating people to a bloody pulp? Well, even then I was enjoying the film.However, when we meet his love interest, the film falls flat on his face. People considered the relationship between the hobo and the hooker in Hobo With A Shotgun to be unbelievable, but this makes it look like a tabloid story. In fact, the love aspect reminded me of Twilight at times (take a wild guess as to whether or not that's a compliment). Then we get clichéd 'gets the girl' ending? Frack right off. I've dropped turds more believable than that.Ultimately, the protagonist is just boring. He's given very few funny lines to work with, he has little to no personality whatsoever, and we're supposed to love him based on mere fighting skills alone. The most interesting character, Liev Schreiber's is only in it for five minutes. And the fight at the end isn't even redeeming at all either. But the worst problem with the film? It's BORING. the first 20 minutes are the funniest (not a good sign), the villain is interesting yet boring, the film doesn't use fight content to its full potential, there's no restraint at all whatsoever in the film... It's all just one big mess.If you like being beat over the head with BS, I guess see Goon, but for the rest of us, Goon is a disposable comedy to stock video store shelves with, and a huge disappointment considering the potential it all had.",3,9,22,1 March 2012
Quantum of Solace," Did I watch the same movie as everyone else?
","Wow, you guys like to complain! 46 years, and who would have thought James Bond would have made it this far? We've gone through 6 different actors- Sean Connery, George Lazenby, Roger Moore, Timothy Dalton, Pierce Brosnan, and Daniel Craig.Casino Royale was one of my favorite 007 movies- Daniel Craig sure puts Brosnan to shame. He definitely gives the darker feel to 007. He did so in Casino Royale, and does the same here. Sure he ain't Sean Connery, but he definitely is a great Bond.Now this one starts an hour after Casino Royale's ending. Bond is Vengeful, despite Vesper having betrayed him in the last film. He is not himself and has yet his biggest challenge- Dominic Greene, an eco-power enviromentalist, who's planning to drain all of Bolivia's water supply. Along the way he meets a hot Russian chick named Camille, who is the only one who contains information about GREENE and the company QUANTUM, requiring him to put himself ahead of MI6, M, and everything else to unravel Greene's secret sinister plan and stop it... even if it means his life.The fight scenes weren't as bad as everyone was saying, the quick cuts and shaky camera made it seem more raw to me. It fit the 'Action' style very well and I personally loved the action scenes.THis film is amazing. Sure it's a bit slower than Casino Royale but it still does have great action in it, and even a cool opening credits scene. I must admit I LOVE the opening scene! Oh, and the action scene towards the ending with the hotel and the collapsing floors was AWESOME!!!! This currently my favorite Bond movie at the moment, and it's really good. ANd YES I have seen the 21 other ones.Anyways, if you're a Bond fan, DO see this. Lower your expectations and have a blast!",10,5,12,26 March 2009
Insidious," A return to what horror really is, and should be, about!
","Insidious... wow, what can I say.It starts with the title... what does it mean? It rings through your head. Insidious... insidious... it's a fascinating word. It means 'Proceeding in a gradual, subtle way, but with harmful effects'. One should wonder, 'why is it called Insidious?' I was excited about this film from the moment James Wan announced it. I am a fan of him and Leigh Whannell, and have been since Saw. Dead Silence was scary as hell and Death Sentence was pure fun. When I saw the trailer, I was so excited, and anticipated opening day.This film will grab you right from the opening shots and its opening titles. James Wan knows how to set the mood for an experience that will fill you with fear and dread, and Insidious is proof. The cinematography is excellent and atmospheric... boasting a mostly muted and gray look, Wan's visual style sure is eye-catching and creepy.The film's plot revolves around a family of five- A married couple, Josh and Renai, a teacher and musician and their children. Having just moved into a new home, they seem to have a perfect sense of belonging. However, one night, the eldest child, Dalton, bumps his head after falling off the ladder and is soon in a comatose state.Three months later, creepy stuff begins to happen. Ghosts can be seen. Break-ins occur. They move to Josh's mother's place, but even that doesn't help. Soon, they find out it's Dalton that's haunted- not the house, as he is stuck in a realm called The Further!!! Insidious is creepy and good fun. If you're expecting jump scares every 5 minutes, you will be disappointed. This movie is largely tension based, and jump scares are minimal. Wan brings back what horror is about- being SCARED. To feel fear... to dread what's coming next.The performances are great too- Wilson is excellent, and so is Rose Byrne. Also turning in a good performance is Leigh Whannell- undoubtedly the show stealer- as the geeky and hilarious Specs. He and his buddy Tucker provide the comic relief (the flashlight scene was hilarious!!!).In short, Insidious is a success. Wan and Whannell clearly love being scared as much as we do, and it shows. To James Wan: Touche. Thanks so much for showing what horror is about!!!",10,19,39,1 April 2011
Across the Universe," Gorgeous visuals, fascinating concept, VERY poorly executed.
","I, for one, am a Beatle-head. They are one of the best bands out there, hands down. I own all the albums and have seen all the movies. I am also a pure 100% thespian- I'm a huge fan of musical theatre and have taken part in several productions, the most fond experience to me being Pippin.When I heard that there was a going to be a Beatle musical, I was excited. Sturgess, Wood, Plenty of Beatles music, I was sold before I saw anything. And then I saw the trailer... the moment Sturgess sung the opening line of 'Girl', my jaw dropped. Then I saw it down in Ontario...Not good.This movie had TONS of potential. I really do think so. I mean, it has gorgeous and arty visuals. It has a hella talented cast behind it (to an extent), music by one of the best rock bands ever, and an amazing concept to boot.Now, I can go on all day about how amazing the visuals and concept. But simply, what a bad movie.The plot is very juvenile. I dunno what the hell was going on- I know this movie is supposed to be artistic, and I applaud that. But the plot basically went nowhere. If you rely on a bunch of Beatles songs to create a good story, that's not good. The Beatles rock, indeed. But The Beatles wrote songs with their own meanings, not to comprise a story of a certain kind. The plot seems to plod its way through without much of a clue as to what it wants to do- Musical-Rom-Com? War Movie? Music Drama? Romance? Another thing wrong is that the movie is simply way too long. I mean, at least 20 minutes could have been cut from the movie, it simply dragged. Real pacing issues ensue, with the amount of material in it- this is one strangely paced movie. It's too long, but yet too short for what's in it. Scenes end before they begin a lot of the time- that really grates on my nerves. As for length, it seems as if the director was too lazy to choose scenes to be edited out so he just said 'Hey, no need to edit things out! It's a Beatle musical, everything I touch turns to gold!'.The cast is talented, undoubtedly. But the problem is though- their acting seemed to outweigh their singing talent. While My Guitar Gently Weeps made my jaw drop, it's that great. Martin Luther's voice is tearjerkingly amazing. Sturgess seems to be a rather minor praise for me though... he has a technically great voice, but that's the problem. But on a lot of the songs he seems to take you out of the whole experience. Revolution was laughably bad... he hits several foul notes during the verses then slides to correct them. He was great acting wise, but singing wise was just... bad.The songs are a really missed opportunity. It seems as if the writer took the songs too literally here. Jude looks at strawberries, and then... *dramatic music* Strawberry Fields Forever!!!! Helter Skelter, which is usually a adrenaline fueled song, is well sung but poorly composed. Because is gorgeous visually and musically, as are a few others. But most of the time my eyes were rolling. Also, there's LOTS missing here; where's songs like 'You've Got to Hide Your Love Away'? Or 'Another Girl'? Or 'Tomorrow Never Knows'? That song would have fit the trippy mood.I'm not saying this movie sucked. It's a GORGEOUS movie. It's very trippy, it's visually amazing, it has good songs, and a good concept. But I simply couldn't enjoy it. Several flaws got into in the way of it. I enjoyed some songs, I loved Bono's clever little cameo (Bono can do no wrong), the acting was good 'All you Need is Love' was the best part of it, etc. But it's not very good, and in the end, I could have used those hours to have watched something that was more suited to my liking. And I don't not like Taymor- she did a FANTASTIC rendition of Titus Andronicus, and others, but this movie disappointed me greatly.",4,4,6,7 January 2010
Cars 2," Even a mechanic can't fix this broken car
","Last year, Pixar hit gold with Toy Story 3, which may be their crowning moment of glory. One particularly raved about scene (and understandably why) showed the toys being thrust face first into an inferno, trying their hardest to escape, but ultimately holding hands and coming to the realization that they are going to die. That scene became the most talked about scene in 2010's lists of summer blockbusters, on par with the brilliant fight scene in Inception where Arthur fights a man in a hotel hallway with shifting gravity. Because of that, Pixar thought it would be cool to thrust High Octane Nightmare Fuel in their next (supposed) family oriented movie, including a rather gnarly fight between cars in a lube station, cars being destroyed with a laser type machine with the fuel in them, cars being tied up and begging for their lives, a pair of cars being tied to the gears of Big Ben and many others.Aside from that general bit of unpleasantness in this bafflingly G rated movie, nothing happens.No, seriously, nothing happens. Mater essentially drives around blabbering. On sense for essentially 75% of the movie. There is some bullcrap about Mater and an Italian race car and something about British intelligence. But the problem is, both of those sub stories go NOWHERE. One should sincerely hope that Pixar was simply trolling us with even the idea of a Cars 2. Cars had a very mixed reaction from Pixar's overall fan base. It got the lowest rating prior to this movie on Rotten Tomatoes with 74%. And it's box office numbers were just barely average, even by Pixar standards. So with low expectations in place, one could expect a disappointment, and that said, that person is correct.Just avoid this movie. Pixar, hang your heads in shame.",2,3,6,12 July 2011
Kick-Ass," Too dark, too violent, too brutal... yet totally hilarious!
","I gotta say that going to see Kick-Ass last night was one of the most surprising movie-going experiences in a long time. The trailer made it look like your typical action comedy. That said the trailers still piqued my interest. When I went to go see it, I was totally unprepared for the dark, disturbing and violent, yet extremely hilarious ride that is Kick-Ass. So as you may see, the trailers were totally misleading... in a good way. It is a bit of a shame that this was a rather underwhelming box office result; but maybe it'll boost next weekend due to all the good word of mouth.Kick-Ass is NOT your typical action comedy. It is NOT this year's Pineapple Express or Inglourious Basterds. Kick-Ass is a dark, twisted, violent and and brutal fun ride through a wannabe superhero, his love interest, a superhero who's dad is part of the Mob, a superhero daddy and his daughter, and a twisted plot involving the mob. It is also totally hilarious and has the usual teen movie formula with the love interest and the protagonist's geeky friends. Those mixed together form quite possibly the best movie I've seen this year! Dave is a geeky, young, teen boy. He has two geeky best friends he hangs with and is totally invisible to the girls. He always has wondered what it is like to be a superhero. But moreso, the question becomes: what is a superhero without superpowers? Batman doesn't have superpowers. One day, he finds a superhero costume online and orders it, and with it soon becomes the first actual superhero: Kick-Ass. One day after getting stabbed by a hoodlum, he gets tons of metal plates installed and now he has the chops to be a superhero! Meanwhile, Mindy (performed wonderfully by Chloe Meritz) and her daddy Damon (played by Nicolas Cage) live together and live in danger. He teaches Mindy to grow up early if the time comes where he dies and she has nobody to go to. However, they become superheroes themselves when hearing of Kick-Ass's fighting with gang members in a parking lot. As for the kid who's dad is in the mob, Chris? He becomes one too, Red Mist. But when the mob believe that Kick-Ass is killing all their members off, a war wages between the bunch and the mob, strapping the audience to their seats for one brutal and hilarious ride! As mentioned, Kick-Ass is just that: KICK-ASS!!!!! A stellar cast is combined with a great script and tons of brutal violence. Aaron Johnson does a great job as Dav, and does a great job at hiding his British accent. Nic Cage, someone I usually do not like is hilarious as well, his Adam West mannerisms are pure epic win in every sense. But the show stealer: Chloe Meritz!!!! She turns in a performance as tough-as-nails 12 year old Hit Girl. As for the violence, it's definitely not for the squeamish. There's a load of gore, and when the gory bits come you'll be shocked for sure. The torture scene is probably one of the most disturbing scenes I've seen in a long time too. Also you may find it shocking that a 12 year old is doing most of the killing! This movie is definitely not for kids under 15. It is indeed very violent and disturbing and they will probably find it disturbing too. But aside from that, this is an excellent movie that is a must-see this year! You'll NOT regret it.",10,5,15,17 April 2010
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," The Godawful Case of Conflict Avoidance, and at almost 3 hours long too
","Ouch. I never thought I'd be giving a David FINCHER movie a rating under 6 stars. As it turns out... you really never should say 'never'.Like I said, I love Fincher. I watched this movie primarily for the fact that he directed it. That, AND the fact that Cate Blanchett is in it. Had Blanchett not been in it, it would have been a zero star rating, if I could give it that!!! The movie was bad right from the start. First off, the old lady was so over-acted and WAY over exaggerated. I have NEVER heard an old woman talk like that before, and I was there when my Grandmother (on my mom's side) was sick in the hospital. Add the obligatory Hurricane Katrina reference to that and, yep, it was clear this was going to be one VERY bad movie. Should you encounter a start as bad as this, I ask that you eject the disc from the player, drop it in a bucket of ice-cold water, and call the poison control, as you have something very toxic on your hands! The plot was rubbish for two reasons: One being that it was just a remake of Forrest Gump. Ferchrissake, it was written by the same screen writer! Another being that it was just nonsensical, despite it sounding interesting. For starters, he is a FREAK. He was born an old man. He was adopted. He should have had a rough life but no, he has it all wonderful and what not. There were several parts where I just fell on the ground and flailed around laughing because it was just so hokey and over-the-top.The BIGGEST problem with the plot was that there was not enough conflict. I mean, come on, this movie is almost three hours long, and whatever conflict there is, it gets resolved in 2 minutes. This got on my nerves. Come on, with the whole 'Midnight lover with Tilda Swinton' and 'Pursuing Daisy' story, there should be a conflict. Simply put, there isn't. It got on my nerves.The movie is simply WAY TOO LONG too. Come on, it runs 167 minutes. The same story could have been told in about TWO hours or less! But no, Fincher had to overflow it with so much unnecessary crap (like the Tilda Swinton plot) and 5 minute shots.Oh the ending was lame too. Come on you drag the plot out for THAT LONG and then suddenly try to end with the *GROOOOAAAANNN* inducing 'Some are mothers, some dance, some get struck by lightning' lameness. Way to rush the ending to a very unnecessarily long and slow paced movie. Can someone also tell me why the humming bird was important??? I was just face-palming when it appeared at the end.By the time the movie was over, I just left the theatre feeling depressed and sick. Come on, too much lame-ness and bleakness, it wasn't even uplifting-depressing, it was just plain draining and depressing.Overall, this movie is a total plagiarism and a very overlong and unorganized mess of a film, and I love Davind Fincher. Let's hope his Dragon Tattoo adaptation turns out good. As for this, AVOID!!!!",2,7,13,6 July 2010
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," One of those rare movie experiences...
","The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo is, all at once, a taut and suspenseful action thriller, and an interesting study of human nature.A writer for Sweden's number one magazine, Mikael Blomkvist of Millennium, is facing a hefty fee of 150,000 kronor and a sentence to time in jail for slander and libel. Before his jail time is to happen, he gets a letter from Henrik Vanger, the head of a wealthy family. A man of 80, his niece had disappeared 40 years ago and was never found. He writes to Mikael asking him to help solve her mystery, and in turn, will help him out with the pickle he's in. So he moves to Hedestad, an island 3 hours away from Stockholm to get started on his work.A tattooed and pierced computer hacker named Lisbeth Salander has been following Mikael's case for quite some time. Lisbeth has Aspergers (or some sort of autism). She's sexy, but she's troubled- she's had a troubled childhood being in and out of behavioural centres. However, fate, or so it seems, leads Mikael to Lisbeth, where they both work together to solve this amazing case.This very film is why we go to the movies. At 152 minutes, your interest is held. It is a long movie, but the length is the last thing on your mind when watching it. Dragon Tattoo manages to keep you entertained, it immerses you in these awesome characters. They become your friends for 2 and a half hours, and the whole time you feel like you're solving the mystery with them.This film is full of suspense, and for its entire duration I was on the edge of my seat. Michael Nyqvist is just GREAT as Mikael, and everyone else is great, but the real highlight is Noomi Rapace. She is one of the most gorgeous and talented actresses out there right now. It struck me how so different she is in real life too- in this movie, she just IS Lisbeth. She is more than just a pretty face, she is an amazing actress, and it's such a shame that there aren't many actresses like her nowadays.In short, do not miss this flick. Even if you don't like foreign movies, do see this film. It is one of the greatest movies I've had the good fortune to see at the cinema, and a film that just improves with repeat viewings.",10,3,6,9 November 2010
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," 'Funny, you like samurai swords. I like baseball.'
","KB1 and 2 are PERFECT. But this review is for Kill Bill 1.Plot: The Bride (apparently named '*bleep*' in this) is a woman who is getting married. On her wedding day, she gets a bullet put in her head by a partner in her assassin squad named Bill. She goes into a 4 year coma and when she wakes up, she is not ready to make nice. She has a hit list, which consists of the DVAS (Deadly Viper Assassination squad). She goes to Japan, gets Hattori Hanzo sword, and is ready to begin the slicing and dicing.This is an AWESOME movie. Great Cast (Sonny Chiba? AWESOME!!!!), and great music. Uma Thurman is brilliant in her role as '*bleep*' A.K.A. The Bride. She is a total badass. She can play The Bride like nobody else can. I was also surprised to see Chiaki Kuriyama as GoGo, the sexy, schoolgirl-dressed Crazy 88 who is also strong in her performance.And not to mention the blood and gore. Over the top, yet in a good way. Whenever a limb gets amputated, blood sprays out in an over the top fashion. Love it! And this is a great film overall, so see it!",10,1,4,3 February 2008
Saw II," It's even better the second time around...
","I attended a 3:30 PM screening of this on opening day with my friends. The result... gory and amazing! We were jumping, cringing, and we loved it. A chick passed out in the audience! Tonight I watched it on DVD with my dad. He liked it! The movie begins with Michael, a middle aged man waking up in the basement of a steel-making building, where he fails to reach the key to disarm the death mask around his neck. Then, we follow the live of Eric Matthews and his son, where his son got into trouble for stealing. When Eric is called down to the crime scene for the death of Michael, he goes over to the same building and finds an old man dying of cancer named John, the man behind the Jigsaw mask.Meanwhile, 8 people are trapped in a shelter filled with deadly nerve gas, one of the people is Daniel, Eric's son. They have 2 hours to get the antidote(s), or they die. Can they get it before they breathe too much? SAW 2 is WAY better than the first. It is everything that horror movies should be, and the ending has a big twist.See it!",10,4,7,29 September 2006
The Hangover Part II," Hungover from the Hangover
","This month, two hotly anticipated sequels were released- Pirates 4 and Hangover 2. For me, this should have been an awesome movie month. Well, OK, Bridesmaids and Thor were awesome movies- however the thing is, these aren't sequels, they're original concepts (OK, well not really original- I'm talking original as in 'The start of something').OK, now Pirates wasn't a bad movie, it had its share of entertaining scenes, but felt undercooked for the most part, and sadly, Hangover 2 suffers from exactly the same problem... except Pirates 4 was unfortunately much better.Now, I LOVED The Hangover. I remember when it came out back in 2009 and I loved it so much, I saw it twice. Every viewing was just as entertaining as the first. When I heard a Hangover 2 was being made, I was excited. I figured the first movie was good enough to have a solid sequel, and Todd Phillips knew what he was doing was good. So I patiently anticipated this movie, and when it got released, I was one of the first people in line.Unfortunately, this is no sequel. It is essentially a remake of the first movie. Why is that a problem? Because the first movie was way funnier.The plot is essentially exatly the same... except this time it's set in Thailand. This time, Stu is getting married to a beautiful Thai woman, and Allan is not invited- he has even been rendered Catatonic for that reason. Yet after a bit of convincing, Allan is suddenly invited along, and alredy having problems with the chosen best man- Teddy, Stu's wife-to-be's brother. After a rather disconcerting celebratory dinner at the resort, the gang, with teddy, go down to the resort's beach and have a few drinks... and then the first movie happens... again.I'm sure I don't need to tell you the rest, because I'm assuming you have seen the first movie already, and if you have, you've seen this movie too. The problem with Hangover 2 is that it's just plain not original AT ALL. While it did have a few belly laughs, in particular a scene involving Stu discovering he had sex with a transvestite stripper, they felt forced, and I had felt like I saw it already two years ago. Plenty of people I know, my girlfriend and manager at work included, asked 'Why didn't you like it? It's exactly the same as the first.' The latter sentence is exactly why I was disappointed- I felt that with this being a sequel, they could have introduced something new. Sadly this wasn't the case- everything came from the first movie, and by the end of the movie, I just wanted it to be over. Because I saw it two years ago already, but much funnier. In my opinion, only one movie got away with being a carbon copy of its predecessor- Escape from LA.That being said, maybe if you haven't seen the first movie, you will love this. But if you have, well, hoo boy, prepare yourself for a mega disappointment. They practically REMADE the first movie, all the way down to Stu singing a song about the crap they're in and then some. If you must see it, rent it on blu-ray- it is not worth the $15.75 UltraAVX price I paid to see it. OVERALL: 4/10PROS: -Some great laughs -The cast is great -They did the 'Photo during the end credits' thing againCONS: -A remake, not a sequel -Way too familiar -Familiarity even drives the film to the maddening point of predictability -None of the jokes seem natural at all- forced at best, really.",4,3,6,30 May 2011
Prisoners," A very good first half before the film sadly degenerates into a messy and over-complicated, convoluted second half
","Prisoners is the latest in a long line of critically revered movies- the type of film that gets revered to death by critics and makes it into a number of 'best of the year' lists that has me wondering if I somehow got conned into seeing a fraudulent copy of the movie, or if the critics have either temporarily or permanently lost their minds. No doubt a lot of films have left me with that feeling this year (Gravity being another example), but Prisoners may be the worst example. And there's also no doubt in my mind that this film is widely loved by those film school students who only seem to love 'film' and not mainstream movies, probably out of sheer fear that they'll probably enjoy one. And what makes it so bizarre that I'm saying this is that Prisoners isn't a bad movie at all. Sure, bizarre, pretentious and way in over its head at times? Maybe. But for the first half at least, the audience can assure themselves that they're about to watch a quality suspense-drama about what a parent does when their kid inexplicably goes missing.No doubt, the first half of this film is incredibly solid and for a while, I was positive that I was wrong about any misgivings I had. It's well filmed, even. Then again, anything shot by Roger Deakins will look really pretty. The film's slow and meditative pace was also a big factor in keeping the film grounded, because it almost made it feel as if everything was happening in real time. When the parents find out their kids have gone missing, their desperation feels incredibly real. Hell, I didn't mind when they brought in Paul Dano in as a suspect as soon as they did, because it did make for some interesting brain work. In particular, the scene where Hugh Jackman encounters him in the parking lot and Dano distinctly whispers, 'They only cried when I left them...' was brilliantly executed. However, it's when a second suspect named Bob (yeah, it's not like I haven't seen films about kids gone missing where the kidnapper/pedophile is named Bob... get real) is brought in, where the film takes a turn for the worst. This is where the film degenerates into a mess of subplots that go nowhere, over-wrought symbolism and a conclusion that is utterly ridiculous and insulting. There are some problems early on in the film and moments where the film comes off as weak, but at least it has the performances and cinematography to fall back on. But it's here where the problems become obvious.Alright, let's ignore all the plot holes, big or small, but no matter how big or small the holes hare, it's hard to deny the second half of the movie is full of them. Let's ignore the fact that the film pretty much only happens because of a ridiculous amount of coincidences (so this kid was molested but so was this kid and this one other guy is a suspect because he was molested by this priest guy who trapped this guy for molesting kids who may or may not have been trying to turn kids into molesters and so forth...). Let's ignore the fact that there's enough red herrings in the film to make Dan Brown wince.The second half of the film pretty much is aggressively poorly written and goes out of its way to be as stupid as it possibly can, while trying to pass off as smart- which, if the reviews here are any indication, seems to have worked for the most part. Detective Loki, played by Jake Gyllenhaal, is set up to be this oh-so-perfect and excellent detective who apparently is infallible and has never left a case unsolved. Perhaps they named him Detective Loki because Marty Stu was too revealing. And strangely, we never get any evidence of this and we often see him making dumb decisions (like going twice into people's houses unattended, opening suspicious looking tote boxes that could be filled with something harmful- venomous snakes in this case). The aforementioned paedophile corpse found in the paedophile priest's basement has a bit where he discovers a maze necklace on said corpse (it's never explained why the priest tortured the kid rapist and murderer because HE HIMSELF IS A PAEDOPHILE) and passes it off as just something he wears, but then it takes a drawing just conveniently falling off his desk to make the connection? Oh, and what is it with this film's obsession with mazes? Bob draws them a lot and there's a bunch crudely etched on his wall, and Dano's character keeps repeating something like 'There's a maze...' over and over. Then there's the scene during the ultra- lame twist where Melissa Leo, who apparently kidnapped the kids, forces Jackman to hide in a hole covered by a car... great! This must be the maze! But nope, it's just some hole. Oh, and what is this connection between Leo and Dano, and this Bob guy??? He buys kids clothes and splatters them with pigs blood and hides venomous snakes in his home as a ploy to trick the detectives and the families, but their connection is never revealed.Perhaps why this is such a killer is because there's evidence that there's a great movie bursting to get out of here in this 152-minute mess. There's great acting by Hugh Jackman and Terrence Howard, there's some every pretty cinematography, Villenueve's direction is as tight as ever. I had high hopes for this film, especially being from Canada, where the director is from, however I doubt that it'll be as much of a hit with the audiences as Incendies was, because the film simply thinks it's being clever. But it isn't. And it's about as obvious as a light show at a Muse concert, to make matters worse.",5,19,37,3 December 2013
Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix," Cliffs Notes' adaptation of the novel
","I was so excited when this came out. I had high hopes, I read all 7 books, I had seen the previous movies. Even further, I went with a friend to the IMAX when this movie came out. I thought that nobody could screw up Harry Potter. Well, to this day, I'm still kicking myself for thinking that. To David Yates: Who are you and what have you done with Harry? This is the perfect example of when someone rushes a movie adaptation of a book. There were SO MANY things missing from the book, or tampered with, it's ridiculous. For one, let's begin with the length. 138 minutes???? Are you kidding me? The other movies were in the 150 area and this gets only a measly 138 minutes? The book is 870 pages and this movie gets a stinkin' 138 minute length? Well, thankfully that warned me for what I was about to see:The Cliffs Notes version of the book.Whittle the longest book in the series to the shortest movie and you get this. Now let's start on what was either screwed up or missing:-The Cho Chang/Harry Potter arc. What a missed opportunity. And Cho being an evil snitch? WTF PEOPLE. SHe betrays Harry in the movie. Wow. -No Hospital scenes -No Neville's Parents -No Snape's Wretched Memory -The Department of Mysteries. It was multiple rooms in the book, here it's one room. -Voldemort possessing Harry... WTF? I don't remember reading that in the book. -Mrs. Figg was terrible. I can't even mention her... in the book she was this quirky and fun character, here she's just this evil and deceptive hag that we couldn't care less whether or not she dies. -Sirius' death. I got really depressed when reading that moment in the book. It was one of the most powerful scenes ever written in literature. Here, instead of shedding tears, I was thinking 'Ugh, thank God. At least that means the movie is close to the end.'There's more I could name. This movie is so awful it's not even funny. It had a stellar cast, a great source for material, excellent effects... but then it took a book as complicated as a plate of spaghetti and made it into... a plate of spaghetti.If you read the book, watch this movie, but prepare for disappointment. Had it not been for the IMAX 3D at the finale, I'd have had a day ruined.",2,0,0,1 July 2009
Grindhouse," Tarantino and Rodriguez, you both have created a movie-going experience I will NEVER forget.
","On the day it came out, I went to see Grindhouse and when I walked in, it was a middle aged type audience, with me being the only teenager there with my parents. When the movie had stated, everyone loved the trailers for Hobo with a Shot Gun and Machete.But really, I loved Grindhouse! Grindhouse is the most unique movie-going experience I have ever had.The movie is broken into 2 movies with fake trailers before each movie, done in the style of a real Grindhouse movie. The film has scratches and other stuff, also in the style of a real Grindhouse movie. Here is a breakdown of all the segments: (fake trailer) HOBO WITH A SHOT GUN: This is only available in the Canadian version of Grindhouse. It is a hilarious fake trailer about a hobo who will collect rob lots of people until he has enough for a shot gun. Really hilarious stuff. 10/10 (fake trailer) MACHETE: 'They F**ked with the wrong Mexican.' Directed by Robert Rodriguez, this is a sort-of take on the character from Spy Kids, another movie of Rodriguez's. Machete is a Mexican hit-man who has had wrong done on him by another gang. He will not rest until he has found them. Hilarious and gory, I love it! 10/10 Robert Rodriguez's PLANET TERROR: 'I'll ask you one more time. Where's...the...s**t?' The first full-length movie of them. A military group has unleashed a weapon with a chemical that turns people into nuclear zombies. Cherry Darling (Rose McGowan) is walking home one night and stops at a tavern/restaurant. She has quit her job as a stripper at the club she once danced at, and is now planning on being a stand-up comedian. She hitches a ride with someone she once knew, and while on the way home, gets her leg eaten off. At the hospital, there are reports of zombified humans checking in, and Cherry darling gets a wooden stick as a leg, later, when she is among one of the survivors, she gets a machine gun as a leg, and goes around blowing zombies up with it. A very solid effort from Rodriguez. Gross, action packed, brutal, and brilliant! 10/10 (fake trailer) WEREWOLF WOMEN OF THE S.S.: 'What do lucky wolves like these get?' A fake trailer from Rob Zombie, about women turned into werewolves at the time of Hitler. Hip, hilarious, and includes a cameo from Nicholas Cage! 10/10 (fake trailer) DON'T: 'If you're going to see this movie alone...Don't.' A fake scary movie trailer from the director of Shawn of the Dead and Hot Fuzz. Includes a cameo from Katie Melua. Awesome! 10/10 (fake trailer) THANKSGIVING: '...It's Blood.' the final fake trailer, this one from Eli Roth. A hilarious one! Eli Roth has surprised me. I guess his sins are cleansed now, for making me laugh to the point of tears. 10/10 Quentin Tarantino's DEATH PROOF: 'This car is 100% Death Proof.' A man named Stuntman Mike (Kurt Russel) stalks girls for a living. He stalks a group of romantic ladies looking for love. While at a bar stalking the group, he offers one of them a ride. While on the ride, he mentions that his car is '100% death proof', meaning: death in his car is deflected by the car itself! He offs the lady he gives a ride, and offs the others. Then we find out about another group, and stalks them, but these ladies are not gonna let him stand a chance! Tarantino's misunderstood classic is hilarious, brutal, and fun! 10/10 So if you love Tarantino and Rodriguez, see this movie. I couldn't help but start applause in the audience!",8,1,5,13 April 2007
Saw," The best horror movie ever...
","So first off, what is all there is to know about 'Saw'? Well, firstly, it's a horror movie from the mind of Director James Wan. It is one of the best known movies in the Horror genre to date. It stars some big names like Cary Elwes, Danny Glover, Shawnee Smith, Monica Potter, and Dina Meyer. Before this there was a 10 minute short with the same name, this time Leigh Whannell as the reverse bear trap victim. It also has 2 popular sequels.There's loads more to know, but that's not really important right now. As much as I am honored to parade 'Saw' as my all-time favorite movie, I am also honored to parade it as the Best Horror Movie I've ever seen, as the title explains.The film begins with a man named Adam (Leigh Whannell) asleep in a bathtub while a light is floating around his head and the water is draining. The light goes down the drain, and he wakes up. He finds out that he is in a bathroom, but it's too dark with the lights off. As soon as he gets out of the bathtub, he finds out that his leg is chained to a pipe. He yells and screams and a low voice responds. When the lights turn on, there is another man, his leg is also chained to a pipe. His name is Gordon, and he is a doctor. There is a dead body in a pool of blood in the middle of the floor, with a tape recorder and gun in his hands. They grab the tape recorder, and they each find out about the fact that they each have a tape.They play the tapes, and based on one of them, Gordon's test is to kill Adam to save his family. His family has been trapped. There is a limit as to when he has to kill Adam, which is 6:00. Along the way, we learn about someone named Amanda, who's a junkie. We learn that she was tested too. The test? She wakes up with a strange device around her head. A video comes on, with a creepy puppet. The puppet is based on a serial killer named Jigsaw, and he created the puppet. The puppet tells Amanda that she must find the key in the body of her 'Dead' cell mate. If she dosen't, her jaw is permanently ripped open. She cuts open the stomach of the cell mate, and sifts through the organs and locates the key in his heart. She successfully takes the trap off and the puppet comes out, congratulating her.'Most people are so ungrateful to be alive. But not you, not anymore.' Meanwhile, we discover about other people, including detectives who enter Jiggy's lair, and many other traps.Saw is a truly great masterpiece. Great blood s/fx, and great plot line with a twist that you don't see coming.So If you like horror films, this is a must see.",10,1,3,22 April 2007
Super 8," Super 8, or 'The Epic Abrams/Spielberg Masterpiece of Beautiful Cinematography and Not Much Else' (also known as Goonies 2: Extra-Terrestrial Boogaloo!)
","I have never been so disappointed in my entire life. I was stoked, Even staying up until 10 PM on opening night just to catch the last showing of it after the Cappies Gala here in my city. And what a waste of $12.75. there's a limit on how many words this review can be, and the things wrong with it are too much to fit into a small, confined space. So I'll try something different. I saw someone use this format on their review of Transformers 3, and felt like this would be the appropriate format, because there's so much wrong with this pile of horseshit I don't even know where to begin.So let's start at 10/10, shall we? I mean someone here has to provide a bit of balance with all the people who are so easily pleased. 10/10 You know, I admire Abrams for going for broke and using mostly unknowns, with the inly big actor being Kyle Chandler. But these actors were so bland and boring it's beyond belief. The main kid actor says all his lines as if he was in a hypnotic trance of some sort. How Abrams let these slip past him I don't know. The fat kid replaces good acting with LOUD YELLING AND SWEARING, with the occasional whispered confused jargon. Kyle Chandler was the one good actor in this tripe... and even he wasn't that good, but I didn't expect this boring mishmash to have made him care. And Elle Fanning was cute, but being cute just isn't enough.9/10 You know, an homage to Speilerg may sound like a great idea on paper. In fact, I'm a fan of his early films. But doesn't mean it would be good on film, nor does it mean you have to blatantly steal from Spielberg. Watching this film was like a Spielberg greatest hits reel- every shot is from a Spelberg movie. And not in a good way. The two biggest tippers in the movie are Goonies and Close Encounters. Every one of the kids is like one of the Goonies. And the events are essentially Close Encounters. Truth be told, nobody should let homage fraís keep them from making their own movie.8/10 The monster's design is terrible. It's essentially like some giant spider-turtle-lion. We rarely get good views of the monster at all, and when we do, it is enough to drag the film down. Seriously, the design made me laugh several times. It's freaking awful. 7/10 Logic. Look, I know this is a movie, and I can suspend my disbelief to great lengths, but come the frak on!!! First why would a train just carry plenty of weird magnetic cubes? Where is the government in all of this, and would they know what it's for? Why do the military act completely dumbfounded when they see the cubes? How can someone survive A DIRECT IMPACT OF A TRAIN HITTING THEM?!!!!!! How does the dad just easily escape a military base that was heavily secured? How was the monster rampant and the stoner dude didn't get captured?6/10 Wow, the logic failures are so bad they require another point. Actually, I'm about to get into a huge rant here: HOW THE HELL DID THE MONSTER CREATE A PORTAL THROUGH THE FRAKKING GARAGE WITHOUT DESTROYING IT?! And how do people survive being captured in the monster's material?! This is as stupid as Cowboys and aliens!5/10 Again, it seems like Abrams can't go without shining obnoxiously bright lights in our face every 5 seconds. It worked for Star Trek and here's why: it gave the movie a documentary feel. The hand-held camera and lens flares made it seem like we were watching a documentary about a group of ambitious scientists on the enterprise, and I loved it. The problem is here: this is a freaking homage movie, and is just annoying. Considering he apologized for the ST lens flares.4/10 The score by Giacchino. I love him but he just recycled cues from Star Trek and Mission Impossible 3. And not that the music was particularly bad but I expected so much more from a man who is extremely skilled and musically articulate. Here he just recycles cues from previous scores. 3/10 Let's not forget the ever so brilliant scene at the end where the protagonist is being held by the monster and sweet talks it into Not destroying the city. Somehow it understands English and follows his instructions. So it causes a bunch of metal objects (including a bike) to fly to the water tower, which turns into a spaceship (face palm city) and takes off. Wow, there's so much wrong with this ending I don't even know what to say. How did people not face palm at this? It was as stupid as the scene in the Dark Knight where the Cell Phone technology was introduced.2/10 Wow, this will take two entire points off! Holy crap, what horrible writing. Almost every line is the dialogue saying the plot out loud. Laaaame...But what do I know. The special effects were great, so I give it 2/10.",1,1,2,21 November 2011
"Salò, or the 120 Days of Sodom"," ...and the point is?
","Ever since I rented this film on VHS a couple years ago, I've been wondering what was so disturbing about this movie. But then again I'm the kind of guy who watches crappy horror movies they show on the SPACE network, so you best not trust my judgment ;P.But really folks. This movie is ridiculous. It's so over the top it's almost like a parody of torture flicks. I heard about it back in 2006 when someone mentioned a scene from it on an IMDb message board. Going on the film's message board, I looked at a few of the boards and read some of the 'Most Disturbing Scene?' posts. Me being the curious soul I am, I decided to hunt down this movie. When I found a VHS copy, I rented it, and the whole time I was excited to watch it... and then I watched it.No denying the torture scenes are well done. But other than that, this film is complete garbage. Apparently this movie was based on a book, and I have no plan to read it after feeling I had wasted money on this trash. The movie tries to spread across a political message and ends up totally failing.Now I'm a sucker for disturbing stuff. But honestly, this movie almost made me fall asleep. Not only did the movie sit on its ass and rely on the torture scenes to get somewhere, the characters were flat and dull, I did NOT sympathize for any of the teens, and I actually found myself rooting for the bad guys, which is NOT a good sign. If that was the point of the film, it was not well done. The only film ever to get that rule right was Cannibal Holocaust.Speaking of which, the reason Cannibal Holocaust was brilliant is because of the irony. The cannibals weren't the villains. The main characters were. They caused the problems. This movie caused the problems by not being interesting at all. And how this got over 90 5 star reviews gets to me.I don't mind the dark tone. I love dark things. I love gore. I don't have a problem with that.Seriously don't waste your money and time on this like I did.",6,1,4,21 May 2009
Pulp Fiction," You hear that, hillbilly boy??? I'm gonna get Medieval on yo' ass!
","Quentin Tarantino's second movie, Pulp Fiction is easily his best, without any question. It has Samuel L. Jackson, John Travolta, Uma Thurman, Bruce Willis, Ving Rhames, Rosanna Arquette, and many of Hollywood's most memorable names.Now there are 3 story lines, so here they are: 1. MARCELLUS WALLACE AND HIS WIFE: Centered around Vincent Vega and Jules Winnfield, Marcellus Wallace is away in Florida, leaving Vincent to take his sexy wife Mia out on a date. Mia and Vincent go out on a date, and a few minutes after arriving at home, Mia overdoses with hilarious results! 2. THE GOLD WATCH: After Butch Coolidge wakes up from dreaming about a gold watch that his dad's friend gave him, he is ready for a fight. After killing his opponent, Butch rides in a cab to a motel, where his beautiful French girlfriend Fabienne sleeps. The next day, he discovers that the gold watch is gone, and goes back to the apartment, but ends up killing someone we were introduced to in the process (he gets the watch, nonetheless). On his way back, he encounters a sticky situation with Marcellus...3. THE BONNIE SITUATION: Whilst at an apartment getting the briefcase, Vincent and Jules are shot at... but the bullets don't hit him! They call this as a 'Miracle', and leave. But in the car, Vincent accidentally blows Marv's head off, with hilarious results! After getting yelled at by Jimmie Dimmick for bringing the body in, and having a problem solver named Winston Wolf come in, they clean the car, get rid of the body at a Monster truck place, and encounter a sticky situation at the Diner in the opening scene of the film, where two robbers will execute anyone if they move.Pulp Fiction is an unforgettable film. At 155 minutes running time, it keeps us entertained for the entire duration. If you haven't seen this, see it now!",10,0,2,27 August 2007
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," Philosopher's flick is a respectable start, but feels half baked compared with the rest of the lot (blu-ray review)
","Since the novel's 1997 release, the buzz about a film adaptation of Philosopher's Stone was abounds. It wasn't until 2001 when Potterheads' dreams came true, and the book's film adaptation came out, sending fans to the cinemas in droves. Since the film's release and foretold box office success, the series has gone on to have the whole book series adapted, including the most successful adaptation, the newest one, Deathly Hallows Part 2. Since all the movies are out, I figured it would be nice to let my inner Potterhead put the nostalgia to the test. Let me start off by that Harry Potter has played a big part in my life. I've been a fan since 1999, when my aunt sent me the first book for Christmas. I had no idea what Harry Potter was at the time, and furthermore, the book was my first big read, so as you could imagine, opening the pages and reading the first few sentences, I was immediately hooked. Every time a book came out, I was frantic to get it. I saw every movie on their respective opening day, and own every movie on DVD, and recently rebought them on blu-ray. As of a recent rewatching, this movie, I will say, is a solid adaptation that, at the time, was considered the 'Watchmen' of fantasy novels, in the fact that it was unfilmable. For the most part, Columbus did a solid job with the source material. However, if one thing holds the movie back, it seems as if he was trying too hard to make it perfect. I think anyone who hasn't read the book will be lost on what's happening, as a result. Dint get me wrong, this movie is indeed very good in terms of being a solid adaptation. I think, however, Columbus could have done a better job at making it a bit more cinematic.The acting, for a mostly kid anchored cast, is excellent. Daniel Radcliffe was a little kid back when this was going on, nobody thought he'd go on to be the little actor who stole audiences hearts worldwide. He really did a fantastic job with the role. He essentially leaped from the pages of the book, he's that good. The supporting cast do as good a job as said Radcliffe. Rupert Grint was probably the cutest member of the cast! He was just charming and quirky as the dimwitted but ever so funny Ron. Emma Watson was extremely cute as Hermione, and man, her performance is almost like she really is Hermione in real life! Let's not forget to mention Tom Felton who apparently didn't read the book, yet excelled as Draco, and Matthew Lewis as the naive but charming Neville Lonottom. Speaking of which, it's worth it to mention how he's grown up so much. I'm not gay, but seriously, LOOK AT MATTHEW LEWIS NOW. He is GORGEOUS. Honestly, I'm not gay at all, but it's so hard to believe he went from being a pudgy kid to an extremely handsome grown adult. In fact, the entire cast have grown up so much, it's unbelievable. In addition, the cinematography in the film is brilliant. From the films gorgeous opening shots of Privet Drive to the vibrant colour of Hogwarts, this is one of the most visually gorgeous shots ever.While watching the blu-ray, one word rang through the back of my head, 'soft'. The image quality is simply not what it could have been. Mind you, this was shot on a considerably lower budget than the rest of the lot. And this is the best looking the movie will be. Some shots looked fantastic, others looked like Sharon Osbourne did the transfer. Also, either it's just me or there was a major adjust in F-stop in the Quidditch scene. The Audio is a nice mix, though, as there is a lot of oomph in John Williams' score, as well as the sound effects simply sound more epic. The special features, though, are exactly the same as the DVD. You'd think they'd have brought some more features in for the blu-ray, but come on.In short, apparently at the time, in 2007 WB didn't screen this blu ray for blu ray review sites. It's not hard to see why. As for the movie, it's a good start, but there was a lot more to come. Still, a must see nonetheless.",7,0,1,21 August 2011
Thor," A Thunderously fun movie!!! Reminds us THOR-oughly of why we go to the movies!!!
","Honestly... just WOW. I saw this a few weeks ago and I'm still shaking from what an incredible movie it was. I tried many times to review it but I gave up each time because I was afraid words wouldn't do the film justice... and now that I've had a bit of time to digest the movie, I guess I can write a review now. I was stoked about this movie right from the get go. I am a fan of The Avengers, and have seen pretty much every movie that has led up to the upcoming Avengers movie. OK, The Incredible Hulk was tedious and forgettable, but looking past that, I enjoyed Iron man I and II, and when I heard Thor was being made, my excitement level was turned up to 11. Not to mention Captain America is coming this summer, and I am extremely stoked for that movie. Thor is more of an origin movie than anything else, really- we learn of Thor's past on Asgard, and how he was cast out for disrespecting Odin's Honour, and relieved of his powers with the Hammer. We then go to earth, where a group of scientists have found him, study him, and in a way, try to protect him from a rival research group, who have set up an expedition centre surrounding the hammer. Furthermore, Odin is dying, and in this respect, Thor's brother Loki has been handed the throne, thus creating a potential conflict between Earth and Asgard. Not many people knew of Thor- Thor was a b-list hero in his day, as was Iron Man. But I feel that thanks to this movie, Thor will become the new Iron Man, and it will develop a cult following of its own someday. Kenneth Branagh takes the director's chair here, and manages to produce a very theatrical, Shakespearian production. There's even tilted camera shots in this, which gives it a cool 90s Flash vibe. Chris Hemsworth is brilliant as Thor, and has adapted his humorous and quirky mannerisms well. Anthony Hopkins is brilliant as Odin as well, and Natalie Portman hams it up- in a good way of course, Portman is an incredible actress and really knows how to carry a film. If I had one complaint, it's the 3D. I would strongly advise against seeing it in 3D- it wasn't filmed in 3D to begin with, it was converted in post. There are a few pretty Asgard shots worthy of the 3D treatment but just a handful of shots isn't enough. It looked flat, and darkened the look of the film. That being said, this movie is a clear reminder of why we go to the cinema. Branagh has given us a fantastic adaptation of Thor, and has gotten me excited for Captain America and The Avengers. Oh, there's a Jeremy Renner cameo as Hawkeye, and stay through the credits for a great teaser for The Avengers!!! OVERALL: 10/10 PROS: -Great acting -One of the best scripts of 2011 -Awesome cinematography -Thrilling Action -Movie is appropriately paced, allowing equal amounts of action and character development CONS: -See it in 2D. 98% of the film's shots are unworthy of 3D. There is no depth in the 3D and it looks terribly dull.",8,7,14,26 May 2011
Zombieland," DUmb and uninformed reviewers, it's time to 'nut up or shut up'
","Now first off I'm going to address a certain subject. To J. Ryan: First off, 28 Days Later is NOT a zombie movie. It's a BIOHAZARD movie. The biohazard was called 'The Rage', which caused people to turn into zombies. Come into contact with blood from the infected and you become one. Notice how nobody died when infected in either movie? Because THE VIRUS KILLS THEM. They are still living when turned into zombies, but when they're fully zombies they are dead and The Rage takes over them.Today I went to go see Zombieland, and I must say I really enjoyed it. With a talented cast like Woody Harrelson and Jesse Eisenberg, this film uses less and ends up with more- something I wish most comedies did nowadays. We've had brainless, unfunny flicks like those countless Date Epic Disaster Spartan Teen Movies from Failburg and Seltzerwater, I Love You Beth Cooper, and several more. But three movies- Observe and Report (Dark, Depressing, Violent, but Hilarious), THe Hangover (Good old drunken comedy), and now this.A virus has infected the United States of America, leaving but 6 people alive. Columbus Ohio, played brilliantly by Jesse Eisenberg, is but one of them, and considers the only reason he survived is because he followed his own rules. One day he meets Tallahassee, played by Woody Harrelson. He's a tough guy who has an addiction to twinkies and only one rule when it comes to Zombie fighting- 'Nut up or shut up'. ALong the way they meet Little Rock and Witchita, two sisters who are con girls. After an incident, they meet up again, only to have them gyp them again. As they make their way across the country, they do one thing and one thing only- fight zombies.This is an amazingly hilarious movie, I kid you not. It has a ton of WTF moments and LOL moments, and even a hilarious cameo from *SPOILER ALERT* Bill Murray *END SPOILER*. Yes the cameo lives up to the hype- it's the surprise cameo of the year! Eisenberg is already a better actor than Cera, no doubt about it. Abigail Breslin sure has grown up, as she is not only hilarious but an amazing actress too- she really shines.My only complaint is that I did not get some of the jokes- like the vacuum joke. I get it, it was a Ghostbusters riff, but I still didn't get it. Other than that this movie is damn hilarious, and definitely a must see this year.",7,6,12,10 November 2009
The Wolf of Wall Street," Certainly NOT all bark and no bite
","I can't remember the last time I've had as much fun at a movie as The Wolf of Wall Street since The Departed. In recent memory, only The Avengers comes to mind. But what makes The Wolf of Wall Street such a success is that it shows Martin Scorsese doing what he does best. He takes the tale of Jordan Belfort, an intelligent yet mischievous stockbroker who was very skilled at swindling stocks, manipulating the stockmmarket, and turns it into the cinematic equivalent of an injection of coke, meth, heroin, codeine, aderall and a number of uppers and downers- all at once. In other words, it's a crazy, wild ride. And if this were any other filmmaker, it wouldn't have turned out as well as it did, nor would I have been able to sit through it for two hours, let alone the three hours that The Wolf of Wall Street runs. But this is Scorsese, folks. His films are famous for effectively blending in substance and style in equal parts, and this film is no different at all.Perhaps the most memorable thing about The Wolf of Wall Street is, and face it, you saw this coming, Leo DiCaprio's performance. You probably already knew DiCaprio would give an amazing performance, but here he gives his best yet. He completely snaps into character and gives a bravura performance that's completely real. From the opening scenes alone, where he gives an almost Patrick Batemanesque introspective into his life and career, his cars, his home, his past time pleasures such as excessive drug use and drugged out chaos, sex with hookers and what have you, you're in the palm of his hand. The scenes where he talks to the camera about certain subjects is where you can see the amount of confidence he has bursting at the scenes. His David Tennant style delivery of his speeches to his staff at Stratton Oakmont just shows he was born to play this role. It's a tricky role to take on too, as his character is involved in tons of debauchrous situations; but the aforementioned confidence of DiCaprio is what keeps it believable.And in general, just how well the essence of the story is captured is unbelievable. The film runs a mammoth 3 hours, and is a lot to take in. However, it's so entertaining that you could sit and watch and be entertained if it ran an hour longer. In fact, I'm pretty amazed that they even fit this all in in three hours. A lot of things happen in the story, and they're all tremendous. In fact, direction wise, Scorsese's DNA is splashed all over this film too. The scene where Belfort is caught for his crimes mid-commercial filming is absolutely hilarious; the slow motion shots with narration about things such as how certain drugs work are charming, in a sort of filthy and debauchrous way too. There's funny scenes a- plenty, such as a long gag involving a high from an extreme drug made with lemon extract (how DiCaprio and Hill managed to hold it together in the face during these scenes is amazing, even). And the trademark 'Scorsese timing', where scenes are swiftly paced and smartly blocked is on full display as well. So it goes to say that Scorsese has made yet another substantial and directorial masterpiece.In short, The Wolf of Wall Street is without a doubt a late must-see and contender for 'best of the year'. Of the last batch of movies to be released this year, this sure drew the year to a satisfying close, and we can only hope that this will get the academy awards it deserves. Do yourselves a favour too and see this on the big screen, with a packed audience. I saw it this afternoon, and the packed crowd was one of the best audiences I've experienced- much like my first time seeing The Departed. It certainly benefits from the big screen experience. And just one more thing: Academy, if you're reading this review, do us all a favour and give Leo his Oscar NOW! He's truly earned it with this film.",10,9,22,28 December 2013
Inception," My new favorite movie
","I've said that about so many movies but the euphoria passes about some time after it's done. So I figured I'd wait 24 hours to see if this euphoria has passed... looks like it hasn't. V For Vendetta was my favorite movie, I now have to reconsider.Inception is an AMAZING movie. For one, it has one of the most interesting plots I've ever had the good fortune to witness. Look at it. Stealing/planting ideas through dreams. Entering others' dreams. Completing tasks in dreams. This stuff is what I like. The plot was very complex and multi-layered, and therefore there was so much to offer in the plot. Not a single moment went by where I wasn't interested.The visuals are AMAZING. I was blown away when Cobb was showing Ellen Page how the dream world worked, with the folding city. As well as the scenery in the Arctic. The sets looked vivid and gorgeous. They complemented the film's great plot and IMO, were very creepy and brooding too.Another reason the movie is so great is because it uses ambiguity THE RIGHT WAY. A lot of filmmakers (*ahem* Michael Haneke, I'm looking at you!!!!) think that senseless manipulation equals a great movie (to a lot of people nowadays think it does and because of it, they rave about it like it's second coming of Jesus), and this one doesn't senselessly manipulate the viewer. It challenges the viewer to piece together the puzzle and find out the answer. Yet it has plenty of exciting action and suspense to offer, and it doesn't beat you over the head with the theme. You're getting your adrenaline up during the action while simultaneously piecing the puzzle together.The ending. WOW. I'll be thinking about this one for at least a month. It uses ambiguity the right way too- I am personally leaning towards the 'he's still dreaming' side, but I definitely like the ending a lot because he could be in the real world too. My friend and I both decided last night that he's lost his mind and is in limbo, but that's what makes the ending so powerful. You interpret it your own way. See this is what I wish a lot of the pretentious directors who go for the 'open to interpretation' approach did more often- end it AFTER the resolution of the conflict and then leave the one element up to the viewer to decide. It can be interpreted many ways.The movie is VERY long. 2 hours 28 minutes. But it didn't feel long at all!! I seriously thought it was only 1 hour 45 minutes. That's the thing, when you're so into a movie, when your attention is drawn to it for that long, when you're trying to piece together the puzzle, time flies so fast. I didn't even get up from my seat once and mind you I'm VERY bad for having to go to the bathroom.Last night I lay wide in bed thinking about the movie. I tried to sleep but I couldn't. The movie was very powerful, it made me think about it. I was thinking about it on the way home from the IMAX. My friend and I were talking about it the whole way (and ruining it for people on the bus lol). It goes to show you how powerful a movie can be. It leaves you thinking, and I'm STILL thinking about it as I type this. I am really glad I saw it.As over the top as I may sound, I am not trying to sound over the top. I really loved it. WAY more than the Dark Knight. I'm seeing it again on Wednesday, and I cannot wait. This movie is the best movie I've seen this year and maybe the best I've seen in general (I do not make that up, and have seen several movies in a lifetime alone).",10,7,15,17 July 2010
Sherlock Holmes," You used to think that it was so easy, you used to say that it was so easy, but you're trying, you're trying now
","I never thought I would have to use Gerry Rafferty song lyrics to describe my utter disappointment for a movie, but by god, the movie was so disappointing that I could just imagine the late Rafferty pointing down towards Guy Ritchie from heaven and saying 'Haw haw!', knowing that his song was quite fitting for this stinker of a film.Here's a fun fact: I was in London earlier this year, and I visited the Sherlock Holmes museum. One thing I noticed was that they did not have any of this movie featured in the house, nor did they have the movie for sale in the gift shop, and it's obvious why: they don't want this wankery of Doyle's classic in 22IB Baker Street.Basically, if you were to to take the characters and place them in a dumb action movie, you'd get this movie in a nutshell. Furthermore, the performances are AWFUL. Sorry, but Tony Stark as Sherlock was not convincing as Sherlock. Watson was maybe OK, but that's all the compliments I have for the acting.Furthermore, the script is bloody awful. It's as if Guy Ritchie read a Sherlock fan fiction and thought 'hey, this would be a GOLDEN film!'. There's hardly any memorable dialogue in the film, and the wooden attempts at humour are just embarrassing.Honestly, just avoid this stinker at all cost.",2,2,4,31 July 2011
Prometheus," Alien prequel, you don't say?
","Wow, it's like it's 1999 again and I'm back at the cinema, watching The Phantom Menace, hating it when I should be loving it... After all I do love the subject material.Yet I couldn't love it. No matter how much I loved Alien it just downright sucked! I'll admit the first 10 minutes were good but then it solely went downhill. Fassbender was so bloody fantastic, even creepy as David. Oh and it looked pretty too. It was shot on the RED EPIC and the special effects are pretty looking. But the script is so full of holes that would put a block of Swiss cheese to shame. Including, but not limited to:-So they find a painting in the Scottish mountains that tells of a planet that may have held humanity's beginnings... But how did the cave dwellers know of the planet had they not evolved in that time?-How Were they able to breathe inside cave without their helmets?-On that note why was the planet so earth like, with breathable air and earth like terrain?<ul><li>it's never fully explained what the alien species of white, gay looking Palpatines on the planet are. I get that there will be a sequel but lazy world-building.</li></ul>-Speaking if which, the idea of humans evolving from an alien species was a cool idea but never explored further.-How did they land 1) so closely to the temple and 2) so smoothly to the planet?-the black goo- it seemed to do so many things; from contaminating one guy with viruses, to create wormy aliens, etc. What did it really do? Pick a story and stick to it.-If they knew that reviving the head could be dangerous why did they do it in the first place? And why did it explode?-How does Shaw walk after the surgery? If the abdominal muscle is cut you can't walk. It has to be sewn together and let to cure, but no, a few staples and she's fine.-If Weyland was that old don't you think Hypersleep would have killed him?-So Shaw had the baby and suddenly forgets it?-how did everyone know that Holloway would become an alien-zombie thing?-Why did the scientist try to touch the cobra alien THREE TIMES?!-If David is an android why did he infect Holloway's drink to get to Shaw?! -How could David feel love?!-If the boss was paid for the expedition, why did he fake his death and hide on the ship?!-The obligatory 'Empire Strikes Back' moment with the 'father' line. People actually LAUGHED OUT LOUD at that scene.<ul><li>And of course, they had to include the obligatory religious subplot, who created us, etc.</li></ul>Ugh, I could go on but I'm just steaming mad thinking about it. Avoid at all costs.",3,3,6,10 June 2012
X-Men: First Class," The movie we should have gotten after X2
","I grew up with the X Men cartoons- ah, the childhood memories. I remember reading the comics and wishing I was as cool as Magneto, Wolverine, Beast, etc. I remember when X Men 1 came out... and oh man it was F'ing cool. I wanted to be like Wolverine. I loved that Cyclops' name was Scott. I got it on VHS for Christmas and I was 9 years old. I think I nearly wore out the tape!!! X2 was probably the best of the original trilogy, in my opinion. It was the perfect mix of fanservice and crowd pleasing. When X3 came out, I was excited... but was so disappointed when I went and saw it. What happened? Who were all these random mutants??? What purpose did they serve? Why was all this story crammed in? And X Men Origins ran the franchise even further into the ground. Quite frankly I was done with the X Men franchise by then.And then, ANOTHER X Men movie gets made. Oh dear. A PREQUEL???? George Lucas made 3 tragedies that were prequels. But wait... Michael Fassbender is in it, as is James MacAvoy!!! And it's directed by Matthew Vaughn. That's when I decided, OK, I'll start taking this movie seriously now. And then I saw the trailer... I was excited... This is the X Men I want to see.And believe me. This movie ROCKED. Me being the geek I am, I went and saw it today. And trust me, it does NOT disappoint! X2 was my favorite of the series, but it looks like I have to reconsider. I'm not kidding, this movie is what I wanted to see after X2. This is, as I stated, a prequel. The first half may disorient you a little- it focuses mainly on Erik and Charles. We learn of Erik's childhood in Nazi-occupied Poland, and how he came to terms with his magnetic powers. Whereas Charles, the man with clearly the better childhood, comes to terms with his mind reading abilities. We follow them through thick and thin- Charles' academic ventures and relationship with Raven and Erik's vengeful outings. We do see them meet, one night when Erik unsuccessfully tries to stop Sebastian Shaw, the film's villain, and his crew.This leads to the meetings with a few Youth with mutant powers. Raven, who can turn into another person easily is automatically in, we have a scientist with feet that can grab, a woman with firefly wings, A man with a sonar, a man who can adapt, another man who can wreak havoc with some destructive powers. This leads to Charles' creation of a school for these people, so they can prepare for their part in the Cuban Missile Crisis- a crisis fronted by Shaw.Honestly... wow. I can't believe I actually liked a new X Men movie for once. At 132 minutes, not a single moment is wasted. The movie moves at an effective enough pace- equal amounts of action and character are to be found. There is a lot of great humour too, and the climax in Cuba is one intense nail biter. And they managed not to screw up the character arcs- except the fact that Charles loses his walking ability in the 60s yet at the beginning of X3 he can be seen standing. But that movie fracked lots of arcs up anyways, so I don't count it.The acting is PHENOMENAL. Fassbender gives quite possibly the performance of a lifetime. His controlled rage and mannerisms are just... BRILLIANT. He manages to nail the role completely and carry the film in the palm of his hand. MacAvoy surprised me big time here as well and excelled as Charles. And Kevin Bacon was fantastic as Shaw. Honestly I can't think of a single bad performance, all were great.In short, this film is the movie that defines 'Awesome summer movie'. It is the perfect mix of fanservice and crowd-pleasing. Even if you don't like X-Men you will still love this movie. By far the best movie of 2011!!!OVERALL: 10/10PROS: -Awesome script -Lots of action -Amazing performances -Great pacing -Not a second wastedCONS: -...uuuuuuuuuuhhhhhhhhhhhh...",6,4,8,3 June 2011
The Dark Knight Rises," I feel like a kid again
","It's been 4 years since The Dark Knight came out, and while only time will tell if this movie will live up to the ridiculously high standards set by fans of the franchise, one thing that is indeed for Sure is that The Dark Knight Rises is seriously awesome. A long time fan of Batman, I haven't missed a single opening day of Btman, and last night I decided not to break that tradition. The minute the tickets went on sale a month ago, I frantically pulled out my Blackberry and opened the cineplex app, frantically hitting the 'reload' button nonstop and finally got ahold of IMAX midnight premiere tickets, and while the wait for the midnight show was long and torturous, it was worth every single hour of the wait.Now I consider myself to be a rare breed, one of the few who prefer Batman Begins to The Dark Knight. Don't get me wrong, I love The Dark Knight to pieces, but it's always been about the comic book feel and how Batman and Bruce Wayne continue their inner battle against himself for me. I mean, while I love TDK, there's too much Bruce Wayne for me, and it's more of a Christopher Nolan action thriller than Batman. So I hoped that TDKR would deliver... in short, it did.Eight years have passed since Batman took the blame for Harvey Dent's horrible crimes. Bruce Wayne is disgraced, shamed, and living in reclusion, with exceptionally poor health. Since Harvey Dent died, an Anti-crime act named after his belief in cleaning up the streets has been put in place, and a Harvey Dent day has been put in place to honor his beliefs.  However, that can't last; a sexy but mysterious jewel thief named Selina Kyle, with feline tendencies, has been wreaking havoc in Gotham and even worse, a terrorist named Bane has arrived in Gotham, and has an underground army who are planning a tyrannical nightmare of a plan that will turn Gotham into gangland territory. This means Bruce Wayne has to come out ofnhiding and return as Gotham's caped crusader for once and for all!Man, I couldn't have asked for a better finale to the series. This film pulls the blockbuster out of its comfort zone and gives us something that feels so intimate, yet so grand scale. The action is big, epic, and bombastic, yet the drama is intimate, up close and personal. And another part that made it so great: comic book Batman is back! While the dark and grim tone is still there, the tongue in cheek, quirky comic book feel is in the air, specifically during Batman and Catwoman's scenes. Mind you, Heath Ledger's Joker isn't around, and Bane is the villain but up to 11 with the brutality and minus the wit and comic charm, so we're relying on Catwoman for those sparks of verbal wit, and it does work... Way better than it should, even! And the villain. Bane. He is one scary mofo. He can snap someone's spine in half like a lobster without even any effort. The mask he wears is terrifying and as a result, your heart fills with fear and dread every time he shows up.Another reason to see this movie is the IMAX cinematography. It's an ultimate sin to miss this in IMAX. 72 minutes of the movie were shot with IMAX cameras, and it helps enhance it much more. They're not just for big set pieces like TDK, they help enhance the narrative of the film. Without a doubt the most interesting use of the IMAX cameras is the fight scene in the sewer between Bane and Batman. No music, violent and brutal, and a few shots where Bane's all, terrifying image fills the 8 story screen just make for one of the most memorable scenes in recent memory.Never has Batman been done this much justice, and thank Nolan for finally getting Batman exactly right. I felt like a kid during several scenes, like Bat riding his batpod through the tunnel, the Batjet scenes, well practically the whole film,  and overall I was overwhelmed with that childlike happiness and joy- the batman I always wanted to see had finally unfolded before my eyes.Do not miss this film... You will regret missing it!",10,5,11,20 July 2012
Casino Royale," They finally got it EXACTLY right!
","Reading some of the negative reviews here, it breaks my heart plenty of the supposed Bond fans here who say Bond lacks charm and wit, and that this doesn't feel like a Bond movie.If you've read the books, then you'd know that Bond, in the books, really was a nihilistic, cold hearted punk who constantly got into trouble left and right, screwed up nearly plan he had, risked his- and his allies'- lives for no reason and furthermore, asked carelessly and constantly annoyed MI6 with his careless actions. He isn't the suave playboy the movies make him out to be. Then again though, I guess it's no surprise considering there are more people familiar with the books. But if you say that Bond should be like the films, then you have no business really saying that you're a true Bond fan.Alright, now I got that off my chest, this is an amazing movie.Sure Bond being blonde was a bit of a bafflement. But he did indeed have blue eyes like the book said he did. Before this the closest we got to a REAL Bond was Timothy Dalton, who looked exactly like Bond, and was very tough too. But no, Craig IS Bond. Craig plays Bond exactly how he should be played. He brings out the toughness in Bond, as well as the naivety and the slight idiocy. If Fleming were still alive, he'd cry tears of joy knowing his wish for a TRUE Bond had come true.Anyways. The plot is almost exactly like the book. Sure there are a few Changes, particularly in the poker subplot, but all around this is exactly like the book. As for the other things... Well, the opening theme is just AWESOME. I love Chris Cornell's theme. He achieves what many didn't do with their themes. He doesn't try to be too much like the old themes, but he gives it his own spin, a reserved and natural approach, and it works. I love the opening titles too, its like an animated story of how James became Bond.In short, excellent movie. One you CANNOT miss.",9,3,6,12 January 2012
Toy Story 3," Pixar makes me cry over giant hunks of plastic now???
","Wow.This film has some serious BALLS.That's right. This kids film is some ballsy stuff. Ballsier than Apocalypse Now. OK, you may eviscerate me now!! Being a fan of Toy Story 1 and 2 when I was a kid, I knew I was in for a serious ride when I went to the 4 PM IMAX screening on opening day. As I walked into the the theater, I had to tell myself that this is it, this is the last Toy Story movie ever, that I will never see another Toy Story movie again. So as the movie began playing, I prepared myself to say goodbye to my favourite walking talking toys.This movie is simply a gem. I had anticipated it all the way back when I saw the trailer with Up. The whole theatre went 'Oh COME ON!!!!' when they found out they had to wait a year to see it.Toy Story shows that Andy has grown up now, is going to college. The toys have been donated to a local daycare, which may seem like a happy place to all the other toys, but Woody can't shake the fact that the person he grew up with, Andy, is away from him now. Sunnyside Daycare has rowdy kids though, who do nothing but destroy the toys. Even worse, Lotso Huggin Bear, Ken, all the others seem nice, but are evil and cruel bastards. Furthermore, Buzz has been reprogrammed to be on Lotso's side. Oh no! The toys must reprogram him, and furthermore, get the HELL out of Sunnyside!!! The film is, in a word, spectacular. I was expecting it to suck, but surprise surprise!!! I loved this film. Great voice acting, great direction, animation is spectacular, and the best thing of the film? The darkness. One incredible scene is where the toys face death as they find themselves in the furnace near the end of the film. That scene had me on the edge of my seat, and hit me like a big bag of bricks. Just powerful, incredible stuff. And BOY did I cry like a baby at the end!!! Overall, it's time to say goodbye to Woody and Co, and TS3 is the perfect opportunity to do so.",10,0,0,6 December 2010
Vicky Cristina Barcelona," I wish I had seen it in the theater...
","...so then I wouldn't have had to have wasted money renting the Blu-Ray! There comes a time in one's film-making career when he becomes bland and overused to the point where he needs to stop. Well, that's basically Woody Allen in a nutshell- his movies have gotten more and more boring (I would say 'Boringer and Boringer' but that's bad grammar) as he's gone on. Joke's on me, I guess? I dunno. I'm only a mortal, not a god like Woody.Vicky Christina Barcelona is a movie that's every bit as annoying and 'gritting-teeth-to-sit-through' as it's title. Well, title first- why not just 'Vicky and Christina Go to Barcelona'? Oh right, I forgot. Allen has gotten so old that he's decided to combine words now.Basically, Vicky and Christina go to Barcelona on a vacation, they meet this guy who Christina finds attractive, they follow him to this one place outside of Barcelona, Vicky likes him, Christina likes him, he likes Christina more, Vicky gets married, etc. etc. etc. Oh! I forgot! Penelope Cruz is in this movie!!!! Except she plays an unlikeable bitchy character who Bardem was married to in the past. Oh, and a love triangle begins... are you able to follow this at all? Because I'm not.Thank God I rented this. I gave it 2 out of 3 stars mainly for Penelope Cruz's awesome performance (although her character was an unlikeable headcase) and the other star being for the gorgeously hot Scarlett Johansson. I think Javier Bardem is a great actor and I loved his performance as Anton Chigurh in the spectacular 'No Country For Old Men', which remains to this day as the best movie I've ever seen in a theater. However, not even he could save this movie. His performance is a very bored and tired one, he goes through the motions and never changes his expression on his face.I am also going to have to tear the narrator to shreds too. The moment the narrator's voice came on, I began laughing. He sounds like a spokesperson for Mac!!!!! What kind of drugs was he taking when he decided to hire the narrator? I am also going to tear down the 'tension building' argument too. What tension was there? Were sentences like 'They had lunch' or '2 Days later, she apologized' supposed to be tension builders???? In short, I have not seen Whatever Works yet, but I currently have no plans to. This movie was a severely missed opportunity, and proof that Allen's clearly getting too old to be doing this kind of cinema, let alone any cinema.",3,3,6,9 November 2009
Beowulf," Beowulf is the hands-down best animated film of 2007! Might even be the best 3D film ever created...
","I just got back from seeing BEOWULF and I wanted to see it again the instant it was over!!!!!Beowulf is gorgeous eye-candy. It begins with a BANG and doesn't let up! The 3D is awesome too! I saw it in IMAX today and boy, I was stunned.You already know the story of Beowulf: Man slays monster, man slays monster's mother, man slays a dragon and another man. Since you already know that, I'm gonna break down the film: ANIMATION: 10/10: Incredible! Looks gorgeous, and breathtaking. It has Polar Express graphics, the facial expressions are priceless. Even Grendel looked awesome.NUDITY? Yes. Beowulf's behind gets shown (ugh) and everything obscures it. Angelina is nude, but obscured by gold. Sorry, fanboys.BLOOD? GORE? Yes. Lots of ripping in half, and blood!!!!! YUMMEH.SCRIPT: 10/10: Great Dialogue.Great movie!!!!!!! As for the 3D: The 3D is incredible. It's not like that corny stuff that pops out of the screen at you, it adds depth. Only a few things come out of the screen, which is someone's Spearhead. Otherwise, it looks GORGEOUS, it brings the movie to life. I saw it in IMAX, so that could be part of the reason... it was beautiful.Anyways, the 3D is the way to go, and I highly recommend this. See it!",6,7,16,18 November 2007
RED," Dull moments? Code RED.
","October 2010. If movies about social networking sites and mishmashes are what passes for 'A truly cinematic experience' nowadays, I guess you could count me out. That is, until I noticed that a movie I never saw any trailers for, and full of stars, called RED was out. Easily taken in before I read anything about its plot, I went and saw it. That blind watch I'm definitely proud of! RED is clichéd in terms of story- a retired agent has his house destroyed by a secret agency and makes for the next state, picking up some friends along the way in an all-out, over-the-top action adventure. But as cliché as it is, RED is also just fun. We have Morgan Freeman, Bruce Willis (in the tough guy role as usual), the chick from Weeds, Helen Mirren- all are fantastic. There's plenty of over-the-top action that's fun, it's hilarious, and overall it's a fun movie if all you ask for is just some pure escapist fun.In the end, RED is definitely not art or Oscar material, but it is one of the most fun movies of 2010, and recommended for some pure entertainment!",9,2,3,12 January 2011
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2," I needed time to digest this movie's awesomeness before I could write a review... and now that I have...
","...I can safely say this is the movie of the year.As a die-hard Potter fan, the midnight screening of this film will forever go down as the greatest experience I've had at the cinema. Just being in the cinema with people just like me, who lived through their childhoods with these amazing characters, who became our friends we wish existed... A truly phenomenal experience. I had never felt such a sense of togetherness in my life. So to join these diehards in staying up till the very beginning of Friday, July 16th to witness this finale... I must say that experience changed my life.And I do not exaggerate when I call this film the best movie of 2011. Believe me, this film has it all. Action, comedy, suspense, drama, emotional connectivity, amazing performances. Understandably this is the shortest of all the Potter flicks- the previous movie covered 75% of the book, and so this film covers 25%... Which is a good thing because it shows Yates put effort into making this movie a big, grand finale. The movie moves at a fast pace, and boy, is that a good thing. One would worry that it would come off as rushed, but believe me, Yates did a hell of a job here. Sure some things were left out and/or changed, but obviously for pacing purposes. I am aware of the changes, but honestly, as a fan of the book, I'm glad they were made.The acting is what helps make this movie amazing. You could tell the actors were in a 'alright, it's the last movie, let's live it up more than we can' mood. Everyone hams it up beautifully. The full power of the actors' performances is used. In my opinion, Matthew Lewis was the highlight of the movie! He always was the highlight of the other films, and this movie is no exception. He manages to ham it up as Neville Longbottom, and here he is in full badass mode. Really, I am still speechless as to how awesome this movie was. I mean, I knew it was going to be one emotional experience, and thank god it turned out to be that. As the movie's ending credits began rolling, I got incredibly emotional. I did not want to say goodbye to the phenomenon that helped shape my childhood. And you could feel that emotion running through the cinema, when John Williams' score rang through the speakers.In short, Deathly Hallows 2 is phenomenal, the best of the series, and the best film of 2011. Rarely have I connected with a movie as emotionally as I did with DH2, and that said, this was the right way for me to say goodbye to my childhood properly.OVERALL: 10/10Pros: DH2 is the perfect balance of crowd pleasing and fan service, allowing everyone to have a blast. It is a stellar finale that demands to be watched, you have no choice!Cons: ........uuuuuuuuuuuhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh.....",10,0,0,10 August 2011
Godzilla," History shows again and again how nature points up at the folly of men
","This film is the closest to perfection any Godzilla movie has been since 1954. That's a bold statement, but it's true. It's everything you want in a Godzilla movie, and everything you don't know you want, too. I've seen the movie twice as of writing, and I can tell you it's stayed with me since.The film is already impressive off the bat with the opening titles. The opening titles are similar to the 1998 movie, with the titles being shown over footage of nuclear tests, but they're done way better here. We're shown old newsreel footage, and every credit is shown in paragraphs, designed to look like they're ripped straight from scientific reports. The non-credit parts are suddenly whited-out to show the 'DIRECTED BY GARETH EDWARDS' type stuff. Alexandre Desplat's score is just magnificent. In fact, the score is very nostalgic throughout, with some influence taken from classic blockbusters and even Bernard Herrman's Hitchcock scores, with even a dash of Cliff Martinez. The bulk of the film follows Ford Brody. Much of the first half deals with his complicated relationship with his father Joe (Bryan Cranston)- near the beginning of the film, we see the tragedy that has estranged them both- they lived in Japan in 1999, when Ford 12 years old. At the Janjira power plant in Janjira, something of a large earthquake happens which causes a radiation burst, causing Joe to lose his wife (Juliette Binoche) in the disaster. Fifteen years later, Ford is an EOD in the American military. the very night he arrives home from service, he gets a call from officials, telling him that Joe was arrested. So he heads to Japan to sort things out with his dad, who reveals that he was in the area where their house was, to get floppy discs containing data about the disaster. The conflict: the MUTO (massive unidentified terrestrial organism). A pair of researchers named Ishiro Serizawa (Ken Watanabe) and Vivenne Graham (Sally Hawkins), notice what he's talking about and realize he is indeed correct. The nest looks about ready to hatch, and officials order the workers to kill it- but they fail, and we get our first glimpse of the MUTO. These things look like a cross between tarantulas and bats- they're absolutely TERRIFYING. After an attack at the plant, the military is ordered to follow the MUTO wherever it goes.Ford is brought into a room where they show him footage of supposed nuclear tests on 1954 that weren't, in fact, tests. They were attempts to kill the creature they call, 'Gojira'. It is revealed that Gojira is on the move too, but they don't know where. In Hawaii, the MUTO from earlier in the movie and a wing-less MUTO attack. One has knocked a submarine into the rainforest and another is attacking the airport. At the airport is where we see the titular creature. After a tsunami, he appears, and stomps over to the airport in what might be one of the coolest reveals I've ever seen. A full pan up his body to his face revealing a horrifying sinister grin, before he lets out his infamous roar that has made him such a household name.It's true that Godzilla's screen time is mostly limited to the final act, but the thing is, that is hardly a problem because the rest of the film surrounding his appearance is so good. There's tons of suspense and intrigue. One thing the film really does good is show how substantial the damage is- not by showing the attacks outright but showing the aftermath- the presence of the MUTO attacks is felt through those shots, which only makes the actual attack that much more horrifying. The film does a good job at making us care for the characters too, and you also really hope that Ford will make it home on time too. The cinematography in the film is just magnificent. Gareth Edwards' direction is magnificent and he has an eye for detail. Whereas most monster/disaster movies show the attacks and what not outright, he chooses to limit your perspective of the attacks and what not to small doses. This is incredibly effective so then you won't feel tired of the film by the time the final battle swings around. It's just a few minutes over two hours, and it goes by very quickly. By the time Godzilla shows up for the final battle, you've gone for so long without him that you don't even care he's been out of the movie for so long, and that is because the scenes with the MUTOs are satisfying, the drama is satisfying, and the characters work. The final battle is spectacular. We see a whole battle in full when the HALO Jump bit as seen in the trailers begins. The battle itself is just wicked, if you're like me and you took great joy in watching a guy in a ridiculous rubber suit battling another guy in a rubber suit, the battle feels almost like an updated version of that. Gareth's attention to detail also shows here- when we finally see his atomic breath, his spines light up one by one, only making it more exciting. Oh, and the final minute of the movie is amazing too. I won't give it away, but it's chilling. Synced with Desplat's score, it's just beautiful.Overall, I give the film a 9/10. Not since The Avengers has the summer season started off so satisfyingly. If I had one gripe, it's a small one at that, it's that there is a bit too much MUTO screen time, but that doesn't take away too much. I for sure look forward to seeing it a third time, and eventually owning the movie when it comes out on blu-ray!",9,3,8,18 May 2014
Looper," Here we go with the 10/10 again!
","Wow, SLOW DOWN HERE, PEOPLE! 8.1? you guys REALLY think this is worthy of that high of a rating? Don't get me wrong. It's not a terrible movie and it certainly is better than most of the crap littering cinemas nowadays but there's no way this could be rated 8.1, with a straight face either. Now I enjoyed the movie. I won't lie. It was fun to watch and it has an interesting premise. However, that doesn't stop it from being crap. As fun as it is to watch, it's very poorly written. Having done a bit of research on the director, Johnson made a previous film, Brick, which has a cult status. I can ultimately see this movie having the same fate, and it's very ambitious. And in a way, it deserves a cult status. That doesn't stop the film from being insanely flawed though.WARNING: TONS OF RANTING1. If the future is THAT poor, how are they suddenly rich again in the further future? Their currency is silver bars, do they just suddenly make counterfeit bars or do they hire some company to make silver? This isn't really thought out well and just seems like an excuse to find some way of explaining how the characters get paid2. Do they need to use just the blunderbusses? Can't they use their own weapons? The bodies are disposed of immediately in some inferno anyways. And if the shells are left behind, well, there's ways of using untraceable bullets. Blunderbusses aren't that conspicuous of weapons anyways, there seems to be no reason for it at all.3. Huge plot hole- Time travel isn't legal, neither is the job of looping. At one point in the film, the protagonist goes so far as to explain in detail why it isn't legal too. But then, when he can't kill his own character, the cops are suddenly looking for him too because he couldn't close his own loop.4. At one point in the film, we get some ridiculous plot about the 'Rainmaker', which goes nowhere and exists only so that Bruce Willis can  kill some little kid.5. Why oh WHY did they have to turn the movie into a ripoff of X-Men at the end? With how the kid can eviscerate people with his mind alone... They never give an explanation except for some silly story about the kid accidentally killing his grandma. 6. That really stupid cliché of 'I'm all bitter because they took the love of my life!' people actually laughed out loud at the cinema because of that that subplot. In fact, how they managed to have Bruce Willis say that with a straight face is mind-blowing.7. The kid is strong enough to control 3 people at the end? But they say somewhere in the movie that HIS POWER HASN'T FULLY DEVELOPED YET!!!!!! 8. That whole ending with how he shoots himself to prevent the future self from wreaking havoc, total copout. Couldn't he have just shot his future self so he could have lived with the pretty girl and gone to France? I do like downer endings but it seemed like here they were building up all this tension between the two then suddenly got lazy and killed him off for no good reason.Okay, so the film realistically would be a 7/10 from me. However, I'm giving it a 4/10 because people seem to be hopelessly jumping on the 10/10 bandwagon, and they seem to be oblivious to the poor writing. I'd recommend it, but by god, this site really needs to help keep things in perspective.",4,5,12,22 December 2012
Get Him to the Greek," 6.5/10- Very funny but...
","Don't you remember those days when you'd hear your favorite singer on the radio, and would think 'I want to work for him!'? Then as you older, find out the easy way (that is, by reading the news and such) that it's not such a glamorous life after all? Well, unfortunately, Aaron Green, a Record Company assistant who is a big fan of Alodus 'Infant Sorrow' Snow, has to find it out the hard way... that is, actually work for him. And so begins the hilarious spin off of 'Forgetting Sarah Marshall'.Aaron Green is working for a dying record company. His manager Sergio, played in a hilarious performance from P. Diddy, needs ideas quick. However, Aaron comes up with one quick idea: the 10th anniversary of Infant Sorrow's legendary show at the Greek in Los Angeles is coming up, and the perfect way to celebrate is to have an anniversary concert at the exact venue. Sergio approves of the deal, so he is given three days to fly to London, get Alodus Snow to New York City for an interview and performance on 'The Today Show', then back to Los Angeles for the concert. So it sounds simple, right? Actually, wrong. The moment Green meets Snow in London, a nightmare begins. Snow is a drugged out and alcoholic man who lives with his mom after his breakup with female pop sensation Jackie Q and the flop (and mass criticism of his apparently horrible record 'African Child', oft regarded 'The worst thing to happen to Africa since Apartheid'. Crazy parties including absinthe consumption, ugly sex, and unexpected detours begin. Just pray to god that they'll get to Los Angeles on time, okay? Now enough of the babbling about the plot, let's get to the bottom of it. Personally, I enjoyed the movie. I mean, I knew what it was gonna be- a rude and crude comedy from Apatow. His movies are often that, and this is no different. The movie has excellent performances from Russell Brand and P. Diddy, and especially a different direction for Jona Hill. There's plenty of gags and laughs, plenty of grossout moments and WTF scenes.However, there's something missing from the movie I can't seem to find. I don't know what it is. Maybe it's because of the fact that some scenes, including the 'Jeffery' scene, go on for too long, and as a result, beat the audience to death with the joke because they feel that the audience isn't laughing, its almost Stoller's way of saying 'laugh, dammit, laugh!'. Also, I found some scenes to be a bit too dark (granted I love dark things). About 10 minutes before the concert, some scenes are just downright depressing. Not to mention the heroin scene at the Vegas hotel. Also, the movie is a tad too long, and at least 10 minutes could have been removed.In short, it's good laugh fare if you just want a nice little comedy with crude jokes and Brand, but just don't expect too much. I personally find Forgetting Sarah Marshall to be a lot better.",7,0,3,10 June 2010
300," EXACTLY what I hoped for
","I just got back from seeing a 7:15 screening of this movie, and I must say- It was the best movie I ever saw.I wonder why the snore-fests 'Troy' and 'Alexander' couldn't be more like this movie. It's everything that a mythology-based movie should be like. This movie will inevitably blow any other historical crap off the map.The movie begins with the history of King Leonidas. Ever since he was a child, he was exposed to such unusual cruelty. Now, he is a king, and is bringing an army of 300 Spartans against Persians. He climbs to a mountaintop, and finds a woman, who does a dance for him, and foretells that an army amongst them is ready to attack. Now, it's up to him and his army of 300 brave men.This is ultimately an epic story told on a SWEEPING scale. The visuals are cool, the cinematography is amazing, and the story is apocryphal with an ending with King Leonidas' self-sacrifice that had me hanging on the edge of my seat.Now I would NOT recommend this for the young ones, as it is INCREDIBLY violent and gory. What it does do is recreate a violent country in a violent mythological time.Check it out!",7,3,7,9 March 2007
Fast Five," The best in the series since the first
","I remember seeing the first one and being wowed by it. I was just a kid, so of course it was something for me. I was 10 and saw it with a few friends and loved it. However I can't recall being impressed with a single sequel since then. Especially the puke fest that was 'Tokyo Drift'. 2 Fast was boring as hell and FAF seemed very slow and unfocused.So I didn't expect much from this movie... and all I can say is WOW.This movie was actually not bad for once. I can't believe for the first time I am able to say I enjoyed a TFATF sequel.The plot isn't anything original or groundbreaking- but the movie is well aware of it, and just piled on the action. That said, even the unoriginality was entertaining- the setting of Rio, a mob boss' money, the robbery of the money, etc.The action is intense and involving- I hated the shaky camera and quick cutting in movies 2-4, so this was much needed. Furthermore, the finale, where two cars transport a bank vault (not ridiculous enough for you?) was incredibly fun, as was the shootout and roof-jumping scene.The humour was evident- the script was like Aaron Sorkin wrote an action movie. I loved the scene where the bomb goes off in the toilet pipes, causing a rain of poop in all the stalls, as was the police car racing scene, etc. Great balance of humour and action.The cast was great too- Vin was his usual cool self, but gotta say, Tyrese Gibson stole the show!!! I loved how he said 'Say What?' at every impossible situation. The Rock was fantastic as well- I was looking forward to seeing him in it, and he did a fantastic job.My one complaint was that the movie was a smidge too long- maybe 10 minutes should have been trimmed, but ah, what the hell I had fun.You know what... give the crew a cookie, they did a good job with this movie, they made it fun and entertaining, and therefore even if you hate the franchise, it's still good as a standalone movie. Definitely a solid start to the summer movie season!",7,0,1,2 May 2011
Transformers: Dark of the Moon," Great action, awesome special effects, hot chick, but messy storyline
","I will start this review by stating that I was not a fan if the previous entry in the series. OK let's be honest here: I hated it. And I really really hated it. Hated it so much at it left me wondering how a movie about gigantic Robots fighting could be so boring. Hell, you know a movie really sucks when even the director himself admits it sucks. So with that said, I was nervous when the announcement of a third Trannys movie had occurred. Well for the most part, this review is full of compliments, but unfortunately, those compliments are for the technical stuff, and the acting.The storyline is not as confusing as ROTF, but it still is quite messy. 2 years after the events that took place in Revenge of the Fallen, Sam has a new girlfriend, a smoking hit British gal Named Carly, who used to work for the British embassy and now works at a Vintage car dealership with a creepy and obsessive boss (played cleverly by Patrick Dempsey). Sam gets a job at an office building, and his parents have came to DC to visit.Meanwhile, the Autobots find new enemies at hand: Soundwave, and Laserbeak, and even more so- a piece from a deception has been found while they were on mission in the Ukraine. This leads to the discovery of the fact that the 1969 Space Race was in response to the crashing of an Autobot on the dark side of the moon, Sentinel Prime (voiced by Leonard Nimoy). Suddenly, things get out of hand when Optimus unknowingly sets off a war, causing Sentinel to betray Optimus by working for the Decepticons and begin t use Earth as a source of renewal for Cybertron, making our future look bleak.Is your head hurting from reading the above two paragraphs? Don't worry, mine is hurting just from typing them (and on my iPad to boot).The action is simply stellar. I hated the shaky camera and quick cutting in the second movie, and so therefore a stationery camera and longer shots made it more easy to take. The finale lasts an hour long and boy does it rule. Some of the most spectacular action I have ever seen is in that hour, specifically the scene where they slide down the building. It is worth it to see the movie in 3D, specifically for one scene: The wing suit scene. I got vertigo from that scene because I am TERRIFIED of heights! Admit it, you thought it would suck without Megan Fox. Well it actually is BETTER without that trashy gal. Rosie Huntington Whitely is so much hotter and way better at acting than Megan Fox. She can actually carry an emotion, unlike Fox. Furthermore Shia actually is great for once here, and he really shines. And boy, Leonard Nimoy stole the show! Live long and prosper, Sentinel! \\\\////Now for the bad. The story. 'But that story doesn't sound messy!' It might not, but watch the movie. I found myself asking who was on whose side. Furthermore, the movie simply is too long. They dragged it out for longer than they needed to, and the film could have had maybe 20 minutes trimmed from it. As well as Sam's parents UGGGGGHHHHHH. Also, is it just me or did the decepticons look all the same? It was hard to tell who was who because they looked too similar to each other. And Megatron should have had a bigger role. He literally is only in the movie for 5 minutes.In short, this movie is better than it's predecessor but still flawed and not as good as Tranny 1. I would recommend it solely on the strength of the action.and do go see in 3D too.",6,0,2,10 July 2011
The Social Network," 120 minutes of patches
","I'll admit I quite enjoyed this film while watching at the theatre, but however on the walk to the LRT station after, the novelty was soon wearing off, as all I could think about was the major missed opportunities. Minus the Benjamin Button adaptation (which sucked), I'd never have thought that this would happen with a Fincher flick. And furthermore, I was quite baffled to log on and see all the glowing reviews of this film. Really? an 8.7?? This isn't a bad film strictly speaking, but it isn't a good one either. It's dialogue is great, as is the music by Trent Reznor (I loved the funky Hall Of The Mountain King in the race scene, and as is the acting and directing, so I really can't come down on it hard on the fact that it's, for the most part, a well made film.Of course there's going to be award buzz for this film, it was directed by David Fincher. The acting is really great, in fact it's PHENOMENAL. The best thing about the acting (and the entire film) is Andrew Garfield's performance, as I will be baffled if he doesn't get nominated.Now like I said, I enjoyed it while I was watching it. But lately I've been thinking about it and I can't say it's a very good film.The film skips back and forth between the trial and the events which surrounded the making of The Facebook. This works in the first half, hut then once Sean Parker comes in, it gets annoying, as the cutting back and forth becomes increasingly constant. Why can't you just show the whole unadulterated scene? Is it really that important to show Eduardo saying it as opposed to the words come out of Sean Parker's mouth, or to show Eduardo saying 'Then he said' then cut to Sean Parker? If you're gonna cut back and forth and ruin the suspense of a scene, why even include it at all? This is an example of the 'patches'.I mentioned in the title. The film is patched together as opposed to having a seamless story being told. 75% of the film takes place in the office during the lawsuits and depositions. At this point the suspense is ruined for us because we already know Eduardo is suing mark. So why give it away early in the if you *want* to give the audience a reason to care about the characters? Another thing wrong with the film is that the theme isn't easily made across very easily. The most glaring example is a powerful scene near the end where Eduardo, the jealous soul, gives Mark, a jerk, hell for offering him a below-cost check. It's powerful, it's well acted, even hard to watch. But it's missing the most important thing: The overall theme. We don't get anything about jealousy and/or greed. At the end, We see Mark add his former girlfriend add her as a friend on facebook. Does this say anything about the asshole he really is? About how shitty of a boyfriend he is and even furthermore, how shitty of a businessman he is, that he became the youngest billionaire in the world for the wrong reasons? No. It doesn't say anything about being an asshole. Like I said, the theme is missing.In short, this isn't a bad film. Like I said it's well shot, acted, and directed, but it's not a good film either- when it's good it's good, when it's bad, it's bad. I think IMDb needs to overhaul its rating system, as how this has a rating of 8.7 baffles me.",5,43,80,4 October 2010
