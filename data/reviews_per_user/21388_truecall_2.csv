Blade Runner 2049," High end CHUTIYAPA
","RIDICULOUSLY DISGUSTING AND A BORING MELODRAMA, ONLY THING GOOD IS THE CGI BUT IT GETS ON THE NERVES SINCE THIS PLOTLESS FIASCO IS SUCH A DAMP SQUIB.",1,3,6,25 January 2018
Joker," Boring like hell
","Not sure why so much hype about an ever so boring movie. Over implying the obvious is what is going on in this nonsense called Joker. Moves at a snails pace and ultimately one loses all empathy towards the main character. The whole boring drama tries to drive in the fact that the Joker is lunatic and it just never moves on. Joaquin is wasted in this over dramatic saga. Each to their own, some people love it coz they cud probably relate to it, but I hated it.",1,31,65,19 November 2019
