Your Name.," MY FAVORITE MOVIE !
","Makoto shinkai did an amazing job animating this movie , the hand drawn animation is simply put breath taking .
In addition to that , the story is very well rounded , the characters are all well depicted , enough not to leave the viewers imagination roaming . 
Thanks love story that occurs between the two main characters with some elements of body swap is not an original idea , but adding in some other elements ( no spoilers) makes it a hall different story .
In summary your name , with it's beautiful animation , relatable characters , and heartwarming love story became my favorite movie",10,2,2,21 July 2018
Forrest Gump," A heartfelt story !
","The reason why I liked this movie so much is because the main character ( Forrest Gump ) is very appealing , his humanness is rid of all the small complications that we see in normal people today ! Making you enjoy the movie even more . The rest of characters are all well constructed , the writers did an amazing job in giving them each an adequate backstory , or they included them enough in the movie for you to get to know them better . 
Forrest Gump is defenetly a movie everyone should watch , as it is a heartfelt story of hope and happiness",10,1,1,21 July 2018
Creed II," The best boxing movie and overall a fantastic film
","I absolutely enjoyed every second of it , the movie has only two boxing scenes , but it's filled with emotions , it's charged , and the amazing soundtrack only enhances that , the cinematography has an emmersive effect , you feel like you're actually witnessing the fights , and I found myself cheering and yelling multiple time .
I rate movies based on how much fun I had watching them , and how they left me feeling after , and I must say this film rose up to my top ten best movies I ever watched , definitely recommend it , preferably watch it with your family , it's an amazing experience !",10,2,2,23 May 2019
Gladiator," Breathtaking experience
","What An amazing movie , the hardships the main character had to go through to not only survive but seek revenge transmit to us his pain and suffering , 
The movie is beautifully shot and the dialogues well written . 
But truly what elevated this movie for me was the score by Hanz Zimmer , im truly speechless at how amazing not only 'now we are free ' is . But all the soundtracks in the movie really gives you the feel of grief when you need to feel sad , of heroism when you need to feel brave , but post importantly of hope when you know the end is near ! 
All around amazing movie , with the best soundtrack I've heard to date !",10,0,0,21 July 2018
