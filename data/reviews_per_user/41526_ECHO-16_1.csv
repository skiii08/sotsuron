The Rock," ONE OF THE BEST AMERICAN ACTION MOVIE!
",It's rare when I like action movies. So I was not very enthusiastic for spending my money in a film you can watch on video. But this one must be watched in front of a huge screen and you won't be disappointed. You can't leave your seat! You won't be more intelligent but you will enjoy a good time with Sean Connery and Nicolas Cage.,9,1,1,16 May 1999
