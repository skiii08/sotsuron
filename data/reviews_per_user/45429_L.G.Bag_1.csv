Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," A swipe at George Lucas for not fulfilling his potential
","I don't think George Lucas realised what a huge responsibility was weighed upon his (now sloping) shoulders when he took on the task of creating prequels.Lucas is starting to make excuses already claiming  `This film is for 12 year olds!' I was 11 back in 1977 and at that time Star Wars was by far the greatest movie ever made. Like all fans I now own the original trilogy on tape & find it as entertaining now as I did then.So why did he feel the formula needed changing?Does he think kids now days are too thick to understand a plot?How many kids will still be talking about this film in 20 years time? Kids will drop Lucas & his Phantom Flop like a Jar-Jar Binks action figure with flat batteries as soon as the next 90% computerised film hits the screen.George you already had a huge fan base, you had the money the special effects & talent to give the world something really special. Instead I felt I was watching an advert for what will no doubt be a mountainous amount of official merchandise.Final Verdict :- Samurai garbed wooden actors in a computerised Flash Gordon rip off !How did Lucas manage to make the great Samuel L Jackson look like he as well as Yoda were being operated by one of Frank Oz's rectally inserted arms!!!!!P.S.  BINKS STINKS !P.P.S. Sorry if these comments are a bit close to the `guidelines' but to coin a phrase `Do not underestimate the... level of disappointment, & hey honest reviews are sometimes like that !",Null,0,1,24 July 1999
