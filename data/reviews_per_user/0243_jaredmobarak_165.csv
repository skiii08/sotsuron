"Run, Fat Boy, Run"," A son? Did you know he had a son?!Run Fatboy Run
","Do not let the Hollywood marketing machine fool you. Yes Simon Pegg stars in Run Fatboy Run and yes he has co-writer credit on it, however, this is not a Pegg/Wright/Park production like Hot Fuzz, Shaun of the Dead, and 'Spaced.' No this is a story from the warped mind of Michael Ian Black, he of 'The State' fame. It appears from the 'story by' credit to Black that maybe Pegg came in late with some tweaks and rewrites after he was cast. There is a bit of him on displaysome British humor and the use of cyclical stunts to add some funny as an incident hearkens back to earlier in the filmat the end, though, this is a different kind of comedy. While I won't go as far as some reviews I've read that being a fan of Fuzz and Shaun means you will hate this, I can see where they are coming from. Not quite complete physical humor nor subtle rhetoric; this falls in a niche of most generic comedies coming down the pipeline. It has some fantastic parts, though, and I am a fan of Black's work, so I will admit to having a smile for most of the duration. As long as you don't expect genius, (or a cameo from Nick Frost), you should still have a fun time despite your comedic predilections.The synopsis is that a common Joe, with low self-esteem, let the love of his life go due to a fit of nerves and self-loathing. Five years later and his life is at an all-time low, getting his son arrested, watching a successful American make the moves with his ex, having money problems, and just going through the motions of a life he has resigned himself to living. With all odds against him, Dennis, (Pegg), signs up for a Nike marathon to show that he's not a quitter. Don't let that tried and true gimmick to win back his love fool you; the race is actually a somewhat small part of the whole and serves as a springboard for more situations in which he can get into trouble with during training. I'll admit that the broad comedy got old and was way too obvious, making me yearn for the humor I know Pegg is used to delivering, but I kept reminding myself that 'Friend' Ross Gellar himself had the reins, so I took it for what it was. Sometimes a little crassness can be fun when used sparingly.I would say that the film had heart, but those moments are too sentimental to really praise. The music has a tendency to swell and the script starts to pull at the heart-strings before fading back as a new joke emerges. If handled a bit more deftly this could have been a much better film because the makings are definitely there. Story threads like that of the son and his first crush during the time his mother is dating a new man are glossed over too easily, used for dramatic emphasis in the life of our lead rather than a way to flesh out the characters around him. With so many supporting roles, I wish we'd have been given more of a complete story instead of using them as props to have Pegg bounce off of. That said, the other actors are really good with the one-way story arcs they are given.I have always been a Hank Azaria fan. The guy is so likable that he can play the jerk to perfection. I felt bad for him at times being reduced to acting some of the situations scripted, (the lazily written locker room scene comes to mind), but he is perfect for the role, laying some sharp jabs at the right time and always being genuinely happy to see someone willing to go through a marathon, an obsession of his own, while inwardly laughing at the absurdity of Pegg finishing it. Thandie Newton does well as the woman caught between these two men. With not much to really do, she is still effective in showing the emotional back and forth happening. We also get Harish Patel as Pegg's Indian landlord and friend, but the role comes off too much as a caricature to really praise, other then a good word for the man playing it. The saving grace to everything, though, is Dylan Moran. Maybe it is because I have begun to watch his fantastic British series 'Black Books,' but he warrants a laugh each time he is on screen. From his relationship with Newton (cousin) and Pegg (best friend), to his gambling lifestyle, to his self-hiring as fitness coach, Moran is absolutely priceless. His dialogue and actions at his cousin's birthday party are worth seeing the movie by itself.Run Fatboy Run end sup being more for the Farrelly Brothers crowd than the British humor ones. That may actually hurt it being that so many Americans hate English accents and find them hard to understand. Hopefully it will find its audience, though, because despite its watered-down execution, any way to get UK faces like Pegg and Moran some time in the Hollywood limelight is a good thing. I just wish they'd market it for what it is, a comedy by David Schwimmer, not a new masterpiece from the people that brought us a couple of modern-day classics. It's funny and it's entertaining for an evening out, but it's not necessarily something I'd seek out to see againwell except the race at the end, some real good stuff does go on there.",6,2,5,21 March 2008
National Treasure: Book of Secrets," Oh look, a little golden manNational Treasure: Book of Secrets
","National Treasure: Book of Secrets will always be known as the film that prevented Helen Mirren from meeting Queen Elizabeth after the success of The Queen. I mean really, I would have made the same choice, because this film is truly high art. Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed the first installment for its poor-man's Indiana Jones feel mixed with glossy effects and convoluted plot lines (Bruckheimerisms as I like to call them) and for the most part had fun with this one. Well that is until the discovery was complete, then the film just dragged on and on for what seemed like hours. This is a Disney film people, you know they will find the treasure and all will be well with the world. Therefore, all the intrigue and the discoveries to find the location of their desire, complete with massively annoying cross cuts between four different locales and ten different characters every five minutes, was totally subverted by the ending's adventure nonsense with no stakes because we all know how it would turn out. There were two things going for it though, I became real nostalgic for 'Legends of the Hidden Temple' and found out that yes, Lyle Lovett is still alive.I give director Jon Turteltaub and screenwriters The Wibberleys credit for coming up with some real interesting set pieces and situations for our adventurers to partake in. Weaving the Lincoln assassination with ancient Native American lore and United States historical mythology and rumor is quite a feat and it is successfully handled in my opinion. What goes wrong here is the whole mentality that sequels need to be bigger and better. The first film achieved a sort of balance with its amount of characters, but this one just goes too far. We have to now work in the President and our hero's mother, who just happens to be one of a handful of people that can decipher the language needed to complete their quest, not to mention throwing Harvey Keitel a bone by giving him five minutes of screen time just so we have continuity with a friendship from the previous story. Honestly, while I enjoyed National Treasure, I never asked for a part two, and I don't think too many people did. Unfortunately, however, it appears we will probably be seeing a part three in the future if the setup here means anything.The movie is if nothing else a good time. I admit to being a big Nicolas Cage fan and enjoy his over-the-top shenanigansthey are in full force here and I loved the scene at Buckingham Palace that showcased them. Also, Justin Bartha is priceless as the hapless and under-appreciated partner. His expressions and one-liners really add a much-needed dimension here. The rest of the cast is adequate if very underused. There are a lot of familiar faces with thankless roles and many famous ones with little to do. Diane Kruger looks gorgeous as usual, but her role is more female in distress than really adding anything necessary to finding the treasure, unless you count watering rocks.So, in the end, this film is going to be huge regardless of quality. If you liked the first, you will have a good time. It is not an Oscar winner or any Nobel Prize winning commentary, it's just a good old-fashioned mindless romp. As far as action/adventure goes, you could do much worse. With some great laughs and some really fascinating connections from history, you may actually learn something on the journey. Never preaching its intelligence, you are allowed to glean nuggets of truth at the same time as the characters that are still in the dark do. Fun is fun, and as far as that goes this one succeeds, despite the fact that it doesn't in any other cinematic category.",5,113,210,23 December 2007
Angels & Demons," Faith is a gift I've yet to receive  Angels and Demons
","Author Dan Brown has a writing style that suits mainstream America. The guy is a consummate fixture on bestseller lists and frankly he deserves it. I read The Da Vinci Code and it was a page-turner; I remember not being able to put it down as new discoveries were made and the intricate plot unraveled. However, when the movie version came out, I was very under-whelmed by what Ron Howard did. He took all the excitement out of the novel by painting a film by the numbers, literally taking the page to screen. Unfortunately, what works internally by reading doesn't usually work visually. As a result, I decided to go into the prequel novel adaptation—made into film sequel—Angels and Demons without prior knowledge to the story at hand. It definitely gave me a more pleasurable experience, allowing me to enjoy it for what it was, a summer blockbuster thriller and nothing more.At its core, this is simple storytelling. You have a man at the top of his field, Robert Langdon, who can literally walk into a room and see everything symbolic and its historical meaning within seconds. As a result, any minute detail needed to progress the plot can be made feasible in the context that Langdon knows everything about anything. His never-ceasing-to-amaze mind allows the impossible to be done. That said, I felt preached to and talked down to a lot less here than with Da Vinci. Howard decides to go forward without any exposition, (if you saw the first film you know Langdon's backstory, no need to rehash again), and delve right into the action. Within ten minutes, Tom Hanks' symbologist is in the Vatican, up to speed, and seemingly more invested than the Papal police with the case. The incident concerns the kidnapping—with threat of murder—of the top four candidates for the Pope, a position vacated by the dying Vatican leader fourteen days previous. Oh, and there's a little something about some stolen antimatter that poses the chance of destroying the Vatican and part of Rome with a cataclysmic explosion.I'll tell the truth and say that the outcome is pretty obvious, especially when Howard and the filmmakers make so many people out to seem like the bad guys, causing you to know that it must not be them, but instead the ones you would never guess. Angels and Demons is the kind of film you check your brain at the door with, going along for the ride and potentially learning something on the way. Langdon's wealth of knowledge not only remarkably makes him the one man on Earth that can decipher the mystery at hand, but also allows the audience to possibly absorb some religious and cultural history. It all happens at breakneck speed, the viewer never able to take a breath and think about people's motivations. The pace is so fast that you are whisked away, following one step behind the characters as they go from one church to the other. Does Langdon speaking his thoughts out loud constantly, coming across as a pompous know-it-all, get old? You betcha. But what other way could we see how he solves things? There isn't; and that is why literary adaptations aren't always great. They are two separate mediums that utilize different facets of your brain. You can't expect a direct translation to work; one needs to reinterpret with the vehicle's attributes in mind. Filmmakers must take the story and make it their own, not just copy, shoot, and print. Howard isn't a bad director, it's just a shame he mostly takes 'for hire' type jobs.The film is not without its merits, however. The special effects are nice, especially the antimatter climax, and the blood and gore adequate to get the audience going—there is nothing like an eyeball sitting on the floor to get you into a story. Hanks is good as Langdon, working his brain and acting smart. It's perfect casting; I just wonder if it's a character that has any redeeming qualities other than the fact he knows everything and can save the world from crazy conspiracies that occur randomly in the world. My favorites, though, were McGregor and Armin Mueller-Stahl as Cardinal Strauss. Mueller-Stahl has a very intriguing role, tricking us into believing he has nefarious ideas and interest in stealing the Papacy in one moment and appearing to be the most righteous and pious of the bunch the next. He is a wild card that keeps you guessing, becoming the one enigma that I couldn't quite pin down throughout. As for McGregor, you can figure out early on what his motivations are, but he plays the part so well. His monologue about church and science being at war is brilliant and his twists and turns during the film always completed skillfully.In the end, though, Angels and Demons is your standard summer film—mindless entertainment with a pseudo-intellectual bent that seeks to titillate more than stimulate the mind. There is some humor as well as some likable characters all on the trail to prevent a bomb like none we've seen; an event that would all but wipe out the entire Catholic Church in one fell swoop. There may be few surprises and occurrences that make you shake your head at the contrived absurdity of it all, but Howard and company also give us a puzzle's solution through deductive reasoning and research. Perhaps the Robert Langdon saga will teach kids that it is okay to be booksmart, its OK to devote your life to academia, because maybe, just maybe, you will write a book that the government gets wind of, about a topic that is exactly like the one which a current unsolved case is built around, allowing you to work side by side with a beautiful woman and show that you can kick ass and play the hero despite your pale complexion and aversion from leaving the indoors. Us nerds can all dream  right?",6,6,9,14 May 2009
Frost_Nixon," I let them down  Frost/Nixon
","Now if you want a film to show the problems of drinking and how it can ruin your life, Frost/Nixon could be it. I jest somewhat here because, of course, that is not what this story is about. However, if what is shown is to be believed, a drunken night of nerves and fear on behalf of Richard Nixon might have been his ultimate demise. After what had been a steamrolling of his interviewer, David Frost, basically reshaping his image and making he, recently disgraced and resigned, seem presidential, soon became the nail that finished his political career forever. One phone call turned the tide, one moment of weakness and hubris lit a fire under a playboy performer and created a journalist with a mission to uncover the truth and save his very life from absolute collapse. Nixon was correct in what he screams through the phoneonly one of them can come out on top. All he had to do was stay quiet and let the chips fall, but a man that never had it easy, never had the looks or natural charisma for life in the public eye had to take one last shot, one last ditch attempt to instill the fear he felt into the man across the table. It's a misstep that he doesn't even remember, so whether it happened is up to the memory of Frost himself, but witnessing that unbelievable turn of momentum can only be explained by it. If this film did anything for me, it has given me the passion to seek out the actual interview to watch that close-up, that moment where television molds reality into exactly what it wants, with the ex-President himself.This film, based upon Peter Morgan's own stage play, is the bread and butter for a guy like Ron Howard. He is the kind of director that makes solid films, but never that masterpiece that may show off his unique style as an auteur. He is a hired handand I mean that in the best waythat excels at non-fiction tales, getting great performances from his cast, keeping the camera on them to drive the story without the need for flash. When he attempts an adaptation of fiction, like he did with The Da Vinci Code, his static style just makes the fantastical boring, and those moments of visual splendor become forced and out-of-place. Give him reality, though, something like Apollo 13 and A Beautiful Mind, and he can direct it with the best of them. Frost/Nixon, being a play that involves pretty much two central characters is just that type. It becomes a boxing match, (Kevin Bacon's Jack Brennan's metaphor is uncanny), between these two personalities, clashing and jabbing and trying to keep the other off-balance. Frost becomes Muhammad Ali, taking the punches, taking the abuse, until the last possible second where he counters with an uppercut of his own. That punch connects and the staggering giant finally relents to give the public what it had been begging for.Now I don't want to call the filmic style static, because that word has a negative connotation. In fact, that very structured, composed style is exactly what is needed here. While Howard never makes the movie feel staged, there is no theatrical feel or stilted movements, it is just a wonderful use of minimal angles and panning. The camera stays focused on the performers, allowing them to become the people they are portraying, enveloping us in the story, tricks and effects unnecessary. And with the bravado of a guy like Frank Langella playing Richard Nixon, that is all you need. This performance is superb, he transforms into the fallen leader absolutelyplaying mindgames, constantly smiling his sly grin, working the crowd, and reinvigorating his image. That scene with the phone call, as spoken of before, is fantastic. A star-making monologue if there ever was one; I would have loved to have seen this play because Langella is a formidable creature on the screen, I can't imagine the power he'd exude on stage.But don't count out the rest of the cast. Michael Sheen is a favorite of mine and he doesn't let me down. His transformation, from ladies man talk show host to a driven, serious, journalist is on par with Langella's from confident trickster to beaten and ragged man, if not as front and center. Sheen shows Frost's ego, so huge and successful abroad, yet so fragile in the states, something he desperately wants to change, unfortunately thinking his charade with the President might not have been the best idea to do so. Without funding, without distribution, without faith from even his closest advisors and friends, Frost went out on a limb and he sacrificed everything for just one shot at giving Nixon the trial he'd never have.And the supporting players, a who's who of character greats, bolster these two giants and allow them to do their thing. Toby Jones is a complete surprise as Swifty Lazar. Between the baldhead, the tough accent, and the hard demeanor, I couldn't believe this little man, who usually plays nerdy intellectuals, (Truman Capote anyone?), was taking charge. Rebecca Hall adds to her great performance in Vicky Cristina Barcelona, Sam Rockwell does nice work as the crack reporter with more than fame invested in his work, and Oliver Platt excels, especially with his own Nixon impersonation. I also enjoyed the complete transformation of Matthew Macfadyen as John Birt. This guy played Mr. Darcy in Pride and Prejudice, and here he is a bookish producer that no one would say is getting by on his good looks. These players are firing on all cylinders, mirroring the film itself as a whole. It's a story made all the more intriguing knowing it's true, and, as a film, very entertaining and a showcase for some of the best acting of the year.",8,1,4,24 December 2008
Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," JagshemashÂ…Borat
","About every year a movie comes out that is hyped to the extreme. Buzz around the world causes electricity that you know will fizzle out or not come to fruition in the first place. Snakes on a Plane caused a stir earlier this summer with internet chatter, but never really became a phenomenon nor seemed to strike with the 'so bad its good' moniker. Well this week saw the opening of the movie that really started being talked about around festival season with its' raucous debut at Cannes and star Sacha Baron Cohen's strutting around France in his man-kini. Yes that movie is the long-winded-title 'documentary' Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan. And unbelievably it not only lived up to expectations, but also surpassed them to be the funniest movie I've seen in years.Cohen is a genius as far as I am concerned and must have schizophrenia or multiple personality disorder because he so encapsulates this character of Borat that he is Borat. There is not one instance of coming close to cracking up or breaking character throughout the entire film. The accent and deadpan answers come quick and timely; this is really a foreigner in a strange land. While coming in, I was thinking the film would be reliant on his interviewing of unsuspecting personalities and him getting them to show their bigotry through the false security of thinking he himself was a bigot. Amazingly there are few of these moments as we really are shown a sense of history for our narrator: scripted and hilarious moments of his background in Kazakhstan and his attempts at adjusting to American culture. Yes the moments when he is let loose upon the country are funny, but there is also a story being told and used as a structure for the interviews to work effectively in.Every detail has been carefully preserved to keep an amazing amount of realism to this work of pure fiction. The low-quality Kazakhstani visuals used for the opening and closing credits could be authentic, I'm not completely sure but from the uniformity of the title's font I would guess that they have been created by the filmmakers. At every instance of a caption or credit we are given words in Russian over-captioned by English to keep the feel of a foreign film being shown in the United States. Yes there is the fact that if it was being made for the Kazakhstani people, they wouldn't have filmed all the cut scenes in English, but I'm willing to overlook it. However, it would have been fantastic if every English speaking part had Russian subtitles to make it as authentic as possible; none of the words need be correct, as I'm guessing the Russian uttered by the film's characters wasn't, but the look would have been great. Besides the aesthetics, all continuity seemed to be carried through perfectly as well. Instances like the gobble when he slams his bag to the ground and the subtle showing of what really happened to the pet bear add to the reality being fabricated and help keep the audience involved with the film.Of course the movie would not have been possible without the eclectic cast of bigots, kooks, and occasional human being shown on screen with impossibly received consent. Every one of them are frank and honest and so offensively funny that there are moments when you can't believe you haven't heard news of lawsuits being filed even if their lawyers told them they had no case. We are treated to an exotic array ranging from the evangelical (comic genius), the feminist, the secessionist, and the college frat variety. Sure some it might have been staged, but even so, each encounter is priceless. The naked romp/wrestling match with his producer, played by character actor Ken Davitian, is perhaps the most disgusting yet hysterical moment I've seen in a theater, and their intruding on a business meeting it is absolutely priceless. I would like to believe each time they are accosted by security guards it is real, but I really don't know. Hopefully even if the people they abuse are planted, the security is kept out of the loop for authenticity sake. Especially the encounter with Pamela Anderson, the holy grail of the story who is friends with Cohen and most certainly knew what would happen, I will continue to think the security thought she was in real danger.",8,1,6,5 November 2006
The Incredible Hulk," Days since last incidentThe Incredible Hulk
","Leave it to this drama lover to think that the new film The Incredible Hulk is more boring than Ang Lee's Hulk from 2003, despite the fact that the entire world hated that version because they said it was too slow. Maybe it was the departure in genre tone that Lee brought to the movie, making it a psychological tale of humanity rather than an action, comic-book romp, but I was pleasantly surprised after thinking it would just be Hulk-Smash over and over again. The funny thing is that knowing this new variation, from Transporter director Louis Leterrier, would be action packed, destruction heavy chaos, I was all for it. I liked the original film and wasn't quite sure this reboot was totally necessary, but I have to admit I was excited to see some fights, especially after hearing the end battle lives up to the hype, something that lacked in Iron Man and Batman Begins. Unfortunately, while the scuffles were pretty hectic and a lot of fun, everything else, most noticeably the middle third, dragged. It could be that the extremes were too far apart, leaving the testosterone-laden mini-warzones to go to scientific computer speak or blatant sexual tension between the past loves of Bruce Banner and Betty Ross, but I think it was just that those slow moments were too long and not the forte of the filmmakers. Leterrier handled the mix of drama and action much better in Danny the Dog, possibly due to the writing from auteur Luc Besson. Maybe it was Zak Penn's script, possibly it was the extreme highs of the fights creating even more extreme lows, either way, to me, Hulk was more consistent and a better film. That's not saying this new installment is bad; it has a lot going for it and if nothing else shows that the subject mater is still viable for a third film featuring The Leader as a villain.The credit sequence shows how Banner infects himself with gamma radiation and what happens to make him leave the country as Betty and her General father recover from the aftereffects. Nothing about the past army base history of Banner's parents or Nick Nolte's electricity love is alluded to or acknowledged from Hulk. This film is a reboot through and through, just pretend the first never existed, it's what the filmmakers do. Basically, the exposition is glossed overhis experiment causing the infection, his inability to survive with it while amongst the ones he loves, and his self-imposed exile to Brazil in order to look for a cureall relayed in the first twenty or so minutes. The action really starts once General Ross catches up with his former employee and love of his daughter as he attempts to extract him back to the US. This mission expedites Banner's return for a cure and his crossing paths with Betty once again, as well as an encounter with the Russian-born Brit military man Emil Blonsky, whose craving for a fight and infatuation with the power he sees coming from the Hulk makes him decide to do whatever it takes to acquire that strength for himself. So, this film is really just an extended attempt to capture Banner as he tries to cure himself, (oh and the fact that we believe he might be cured for only ten seconds before they completely disregard that whole plot line in order for a war to break out is just one of the many failures of plot lines that could have been very interesting). At the end, we really find that we are in the exact same situation we were in at the startexcept now Betty knows her Bruce is alive.While the story may be lacking, the action is not. Tim Roth, as Blonsky, has a wild fire raging behind his eyes. The guy will not give up, despite any odds piled against him. When he takes a taste of the gamma poisoning in order to even the playing field versus the Hulk, you just know that small sample will never satiate his lust for blood. Super-Roth goes against the green giant and it is pretty exciting, even the sonar cannon effects are cool to watch as they attempt to stop the monster. The final battle is a lot of fun with destruction, but it is the chase scene in Brazil that sticks to mind after leaving the theatre. Brazil's cityscape is ripe for an extended sequence with its housing and factories all jammed packed together on a hillside with barely room for a street between them. Banner and Blonsky run after each other while extras from Bruce's job crop up with a bad attitude. The first transformation finally occurs, yet most of it is seen from the shadows. A brilliant use of deflection helps make the chase more exhilarating than the computer generated fight at the finaleno matter how much fun that still ends up being.The boring, drawn out exchanges between action set pieces may ruin the pacing and enjoyment, but to me it is really the new cast at fault. Whether you liked Lee's version or not, you shouldn't be able to question the actors involved. All those on screen here pale in comparison and probably cause the mediocrity of those scenes. Liv Tyler's whisper doesn't have the same panache as the strong-willed Jennifer Connolly, William Hurt's overacting to be the hardass can't touch Sam Elliot's natural born proclivity to that demeanor, and, no matter how much I like Ed Norton, Eric Bana hit the conflicted internal struggle emotive quality out of the park in Hulk. Maybe if the old cast was brought into this film, the parts that fail could have worked and rather then bring down the smash and grab moments, could have enhanced their success, making the enjoyment level higher and the film better as a result.",6,3,6,15 June 2008
Mission: Impossible III," 'Always assume the AntiGod'
","'There is a point where bold becomes stupid.' Ving Rhames's character Luthor speaks these words and couldn't be more right. Just by looking at the evolution of the Mission Impossible series, one can see a bold example of cerebral storytelling shot by virtuoso Brian De Palma and a cold, mechanical showing, of a really stupid haircut, filmed by John Woo, who still hasn't matched the brilliance of his final Hong Kong piece Hard Boiled stateside. Mission Impossible III definitely could have fallen in either campmy thoughts leaned towards stupid however, thanks, I'm sure in no small part to J.J. Abrams, we are given an enjoyable piece of popcorn action infused with just the right amount of heart.Unlike the first film incarnation, which had multiple characters backseat-bound to the intricate story, and the second, a vanity project with everything on the periphery of Tom Cruise as an expendable device, we are now given a look into what makes the characters who they are and allow us to have an emotional tie to them, while still being treated with some high-powered eye-candy. There is a definite comparison to Abrams's TV show 'Lost' as the story is shot with a few flashbacks to help show the audience exposition. We aren't treated like babies and fed with an update on where the characters have been at the beginning. Instead we are thrown right into the struggle before being jarred into the past to see how we arrived at that point. Abrams seems a master at character development in as few words as possible. He needs only one sentence to explain the past life of Michelle Monaghan's Jules at an early engagement party scene. We don't even need to be told what she does for a living because Ethan will visit her at the hospital. Is she a doctor or nurse? It doesn't matter, she helps people and that itself adds to her character.Superb acting is shown along with the elaborate, non-stop action. Besides Cruise, who does all he is asked, everyone is given a secondary role that they run with. No one seems on the fringe and all are integral to the plot. Monaghan does a good job of being the love interest who is not frail and defenselessknown by the basejumping she was doing when she met Hunt, this fearlessness helps the audience accept what her character is asked to do towards the endand builds upon her resume after a nice turn in last year's grossly overlooked Kiss, Kiss, Bang, Bang; Jonathan Rhys Meyers, Maggie Q, and Rhames play the action heroes to perfection, exuding kidlike glee upon accomplishing an impossible task; Billy Crupup gives a nice understated performance as Ethan's contact at the agency; and Laurence Fishburne infuses some welcome straightfaced sarcasm. Not surprisingly, Philip Seymour Hoffman is also fantastic as the villain, adding credibility to a film that needed it after the debacle that was MI:II. The best, however, is scenestealing Simon Pegg, who is so funny he reminded me of how much I loved Shaun of the Dead and am anticipating the forthcoming Hot Fuzz.Overall, Mission Impossible III delivers on the action as promised, but also shows heart. Everything is done for love and that really does help us follow the journey and feel for these people as they try to juggle saving the world along with saving their home.",7,0,0,22 July 2006
3:10 to Yuma," Even bad men love they mommas3:10 to Yuma
","It is interesting how having an Oscar nominated director and actor, along with an Oscar winning actor can make a film garner award season buzz rather than the backlash of being a remake. The stigma of remake usually spells the kiss of death for most films, but it seems almost an afterthought with James Mangold's 3:10 to Yuma. Based on an Elmore Leonard short story, the original is somewhat highly touted, so it is not as though people don't know of it to have forgotten. Either way, I believe a film should be looked upon individually and not necessarily compared to what came before it. Sure, that will never happen, as comparisons are too easy to not be made, but if a remake works, it works on its own. As far as this one goes, hot on the heels of two remakes I did not enjoyThe Invasion and Halloweenwe finally have a winner. I have not seen its predecessor, however, the Western genre has been seeing somewhat of a revival lately. As far as those go, this does not quite match the brilliance of The Proposition from last year, it does ultimately warrant a look.By far, it's the acting that really shines. Between the Oscar winner in Russell Crowe and Christian Bale, (no he isn't the nominated actor here, that's Peter Fonda, Bale still surprisingly hasn't been so honored), you have an acting clinic. These two are phenomenal as the outlaw being taken to his death and the rancher who volunteers to do it. Bale has shown that he is fantastic as the honest, hardworking, moral figure trying to do right by his family, but rarely have we seen Crowe as a complete villain. Even his L.A. Confidential badass was at heart a good guy that was working for bad men. Here he is great as the cocky, fast-talking, charismatic, psychopathic killer. Bale's character's son says, he is not all bad, when actually, Crowe says, he is. No matter how affable he can appear, it is always for his own devices in order to get close and pull the trigger. While this aspect is wonderful on the whole, it is also the one main flaw of the film. We are shown this dark side of Crowe for the entire duration, and, as a result, the evolution of the relationship between he and Bale becomes implausible. I just truly didn't believe that they would have opened up to each other as they do.Those two leads are by far the reasons to check out the film. It's like the buzz surrounding Righteous Kill which all culminates to the fact that we will be able to see DeNiro and Pacino on screen together; these two have that same dynamic and possibly are a tad better at that. There are more good actors here tooAlan Tudyk plays a rendition of his usual persona, Gretchen Mol is a welcome sight having been away from the scene for awhile, and Ben Foster again shows why he is the actor of choice for crazed lunatics. The one bad casting call is Luke Wilson in a bit part. Being Luke Wilson is a detriment because all the audience does is laugh at him trying to be serious. He might have been spot-on in the performance, but I'll never know; you really can't get past who he is to actually find out.There is a plot involved here too, and it isn't that bad of one. The tension and wonder at whether they will make the train weighs heavy throughout the film and the interactions between the characters help create the interest. Aesthetically, the filmmakers do a good job showing the grime and filth of the time period as well as the carnage and selfishness that was prevalent. Were it two lesser actors, however, I have to believe I might have been bored by the length of the journey. It is Bale and Crowe chewing scenery that keeps the film from falling into a slow, plodding pace. The finale saves everything with the action amped up fully, the shootout is orchestrated to perfection. Again, though, I didn't quite believe why Crowe does what he does during it. I understand his ego and him thinking he had the ability to help Bale's psyche while still not hurting himself, but it was a bit too convenient. The bittersweet ending did help save any problems I had with it and in the end I will say I had a real good time.",8,2,5,8 September 2007
The Hangover," Couldn't find a meter, but here's four bucks  The Hangover
","The success of Old School pretty much vaulted Todd Phillips onto the A-list for comedy directors. We waited and waited for his second hit, but only got the mediocre Starsky and Hutch and, what I can only imagine as disappointing, School for Scoundrels. The Hangover lives up to the exorbitant amount of praise being tossed around everywhere; the buzz is running rampant online and rumors of a sequel have already started months before the film is even released. Movies pertaining to the alcohol induced shenanigans that can occur at a bachelor party two days before the wedding—in Vegas no less—always bring something funny to the table. The Hangover, however, trumps them all on sheer absurdity, craziness, and all-around hilarity.Doug is about to marry the girl of his dreams, a woman with wealth, but also a family that seems grounded in reality. It is a couple days before the nuptials and Doug is on his way to Vegas for a night of fun with his two best friends and soon-to-be brother-in-law. This foursome is such a mixed bag that you believe them to all be real friends. Doug is the successful, who knows what, (we sadly learn very little about his character as he is a mere pawn for the evening to occur); Phil is the married teacher that hates his life, marriage, and children in general; and Stu is the nerdy doctor—sorry, dentist—without a backbone, but who you know can be wild when a few drinks have been imbibed. As for Alan, the bride-to-be's brother, he is the wild card of the bunch. Only having met Phil and Stu a few times and a bit off in the head—he is not a 'rah-tard' though—you never know how he may interact with the others, nor what he may do or say about his wolfpack brothers.The evening starts with the four going to the hotel's roof to take a shot of Jager and toast the groom on one last night of partying. It is right after this exchange that Phillips brings us to the next morning: Stu minus a tooth, Alan without pants and in the company of a tiger, and Phil with no recollection that he was in the hospital sometime during the night. Well, I don't want to knock Phil too much; no one remembers anything of what happened, nor can they find Doug. In fact, rather than their friend, they find a baby crying in the closet. Amidst the strewn-about debris, smoking chair, and random chicken, the boys realize that they have less than 48 hours to find the groom and get him to his wedding. The adventure that commences takes them on a journey through the many locations they visited the night before, compiling a timeline while allowing the audience to enjoy the laughs that come with the evidence of what happened and the reactions to it all from the threesome. Throw in a newly married stripper; a gay Asian with crimeworld pull, angry and naked from being trapped in the trunk of a car; a kidnapping; a stolen police car; and yes, Mike Tyson singing Phil Collins, and you can only imagine the uproarious laughter that will be emitting from your body.But it is Galifianakis who surprises the most and completely shines as the off-kilter Alan. I'll admit to mostly being turned off by his brand of humor, generally jokes that run on too long and are too dry for their own good, (although he is the best thing in Out Cold). Here, however, it all works beautifully. Even when he risks going too far, like with his wolfpack speech at the beginning, Phillips seems to have been able to cut him to the perfect length in order to maintain the joke and not destroy it. He is a little child—'don't let the beard fool you'—and his innocence and ambivalence to what is going on around him is priceless. His emotions get the better of him, he wants nothing more than to be Cooper's best friend or carbon copy, his delivery of absurd lines is so straight-faced you become as dumbfounded as Stu and Phil, and his props add even more to the character. His satchel, his Blackjack book, and his roofies, among other things, enhance the jokes and the plot. A moment with him and Cooper mimicking Rain Man brings the laughs as does a slo-mo sequence between he and a little boy on a field trip to a police station. When Galifianakis is on screen, you truly have no idea what will happen next.I know I have spoken little about the plot, but really, besides pertaining to three guys trying to remember what happened to them the night before, and where their best friend went, there isn't much else to say. The Hangover could have easily fallen prey to the 'SNL' syndrome of just being skit after skit, loosely connected into a story, yet too disjointed to really enjoy, but the cast and crew never let this happen. Bringing in actors like Heather Graham, Rachael Harris, and a scene-stealing performance from Ken Jeong only expand the story rather than derail it. The jokes come so quick and successfully that you have little time to question what is happening, and you are laughing so hard that you are probably missing dialogue anyways. And don't even get me started on Mike Tyson's lisp; he deserves a high-five for sure. The only thing I can say is that you will laugh, because, honestly, who wouldn't enjoy watching a night of excess that went so overboard it's participants can only recall what happened through the X-rated photos on their digital camera? Yes, you do get to see those gems in all their glory during the end credits.",8,1,3,20 June 2009
Marie Antoinette," Let them eat cakeMarie Antoinette
","Sofia Coppola has risen in Hollywood to A-list status after her magnificent debut, The Virgin Suicides, and the over-long, funny at times, critical darling Lost in Translation. Due to the enormous success of Translation, she was able to rework the production, with a bigger budget, on her passion project Marie Antoinette. While trying to stick to historical accuracies when able, she crafted a loose interpretation of the young Queen's life from leaving Austria for marriage until the fateful storming of the Bastille. Coppola's father had success with directing a period piece in his adaptation of Bram Stoker's Dracula, but I must say Sophia has outdone him on style. The scenery and costumes are straight out of Versailles circa the late 1700's and really are beautiful to behold. To counteract this look of the past, we are treated to a soundtrack of contemporary music: loud, hard-hitting rock nicely juxtaposed with the life of excess on screen. While it worked to great effect, it is a shame that it worked better as a way to keep me awake during the long and boring tale, which contained not a shred of plot. This was perhaps the most luscious film I've seen as far as the senses go; it's just too bad there was no substance behind it.If you have kept up with the hoopla surrounding its release at Cannes, you will know about the booing that the French people gave it upon completion. Then we had the obligatory retorts by its' creator and actors explaining how this was a vision of her life and not a history lesson. Unfortunately I can't give that statement credit due to the fact that the movie played like a history lesson. We have long takes of the royalty's activities, small vignettes of life cut together without any progression besides the passing of time. There is no struggle, there is no reason to care for these spoiled children as they play; we as an audience are voyeurs, looking through a window at the life of the Queen, not emotionally involved in anything happening. Now I thought Lost in Translation had a too thin a script and plot to warrant an Oscar nomination let alone the victory it achieved, Marie Antoinette, however, has even less. Coppola can write perfect dialogue for these people as they live their lives in the limelight and under archane rules and regulations, but dialogue is not enough. We need a story to be interested in, complete with problems and suspense where one can make a decision about what they hope will happen next. Instead we are given a reenactment of life, a history lesson written and then made alive.It is hard to really hate this film, though, as even though there was no story whatsoever to warrant a running time of two hours, the visuals and acting are superb. Kirsten Dunst is so calm and infectious to watch, that it seems she might have just been ad-libbing the entire time and saying what she herself would say in that situation. The comfort level is great and really adds to the believability of the character. Coppola's cousin Jason Schwartzman is brilliantly shy and unconfident as the young heir to the throne before his gradual evolution into a man with principles and a real love for his wife and children. Most of the other big names have small roles that they excel in; nothing too memorable, but nothing glaringly out of place. The radiant Rose Byrne is comically perpetually inebriated, Asia Argento has a nicely complex role that never is built upon to maybe spice the story up a little with, and Rip Torn, although his usual loud and obnoxious self, is rather subdued and effective. Credit is given to Steve Coogan, who is almost unrecognizable as straight man unlike previous comedic roles, and to Danny Huston, who leaves his mark on a part that lasts maybe five total minutes.Coppola has talentthere is no questionand at times here shows us some gorgeous moments. The composition of shots early on to show Antoinette's isolation are superb, a slow-motion action shot of a soldier on horseback at the end is exactly what's needed for the emotional resonance at that time, and a quick shot of Dunst in the fields at Versailles with a ladybug taking flight from her fingertip show a keen eye for detail. Another thing she has going for her is the use of music. Throughout all three of her movies, the soundtrack has been a great enhancer, here especially during the second half, right about when I Want Candy plays. I just feel she needs to work on her writing a bit more. Lost in Translation was a sprawling tale that could have used some fine-tuning to create interest in the characters rather than relying on Bill Murray's natural charisma, and with this film she desperately needed a script doctor to help her construct an interesting beginning to go with the magnificent final fifteen minutes. The end of this film is some of the best film-making I've seen all year, the emotions displayed by both Dunst and Schwartzman are heartfelt and real. To see the results of the evolution into honor and responsibility that they took is astonishing, as well as the pitch-perfect final frame. It is just a shame that the first two hours of the movie did nothing to show that process. I still hold out hope that Sophia will make the masterpiece that is buried inside her. Also, maybe her brother Roman, who was Assistant Director here, will recover the directing bug and finally film a sophomore effort to go along with, one of my favorite films, CQ. Hopefully after such a well-written and produced debut he won't lose his way like his sister seems to have thus far.",5,1,3,27 October 2006
Stop-Loss," Read the cards ShortyStop-Loss
","Kimberly Peirce's Stop-Loss is the perfect example of a film that can show whether you like the medium or the stories. I think I can tell myself that I am a true film fanatic after watching this because I thought it was a great piece of work. I've come to this conclusion because while I would see it again and recommend it to friends, I cannot condone one iota of it. It is blatantly anti-war, anti-American, and probably the worst thing that can happen in the US right now. Moral in the war and the troops cannot be helped at all with this very message-driven story. Despite all that, though, I really enjoyed my time with these characters despite how vain and selfish they are. The emotions are real and Peirce shows once again how authentic she can make the South look and feel with a nice rendering of Texas.Despite all those personal reservations and the fact that this film could damage people's outlooks on a war they already don't agree with, as an entry to the world of cinema, it is very effective. I would compare it to The Deer Hunter in its portrayal of wartime clichés without making them feel forced or stereotypical, (not for being even close to the masterpiece that Vietnam movie is, but I could call this an MTV generation's version). We have the newly weds rejoining after a tour of duty and the hardships that entails, we have the injured soldier banished to a wheelchair and a life of blindness, the soldier so taken out of reality that being a soldier is all he knows, and the entire group suffering from mild to extreme Gulf War Syndrome on full display. Credit Peirce for showing it all realistically and somewhat sympathetically, never wholly to manipulate the audience, but instead to just tell the story she wanted to tell. Her directing style is effective as well, from the hand-held look and feel of the alley ambush at the start, the grainy home-film of the troops letting off steam during downtime, to the dark close-ups following the group around back in America. For those intense scenes of violence she deftly cuts in footage from Iraq with what is happening on screen. The sequence with Phillippe and the thieves who stole Abbie Cornish's purse is very memorable. Both from the choreography and brutality as well as the reverting back to his Sergeant self, engaging an enemy that is manifested in his mind. Peirce's only misstep is with the concealing of an event back in Iraq upon Phillippe saving Channing Tatum. To show this scene towards the end of the movie, a scene so out of the blue because it was never alluded to before, was blatant manipulation. She was doing so well at allowing everything to happen on course, until she spliced that harrowing moment to make us hate the war even more. The whole movie could be seen as manipulating the truth, but that instance was the one that made me angry.A big part of my enjoyment, though, is in the fantastic acting by a strong troupe of young thespians. Emotions run high throughout, from extreme happiness to the depths of utter pain and sorrow. The two characters we spend the most time with are Phillippe and Cornish. He is really amazing in his portrayal of the leader in the field and off it. His ability to diffuse the situations cropping up with his friends and soldiers is well played. The slow devolution of his façade that everything is all right is also great. He is the one with his head on straight, but when pushed against a wall, the psyche shows its imperfections. Kudos to Victor Rasuk as Rico. His outlook on the life he must lead from now on was an interesting thing to see. The juxtaposition of his injuries to the smile and disposition talking with his friend is tough to assimilate. War is most definitely hell, and I liked the lingering shot of him as his two visitors leave the room; his realization and snap back to the reality of being in that bed alone with only his memories of a full life that was there for the taking.My favorites, however, are Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Channing Tatum. Gordon-Levitt has made a name for himself playing the troubled young adult dealing with inner demons. There is a lot of his character from Manic here as he attempts to reconcile his feelings of relief and happiness to be home with those of hatred and revenge in wanting to go back to the Middle East to cause havoc. Tatum, on the other hand, was a big surprise. I guess when given a role that doesn't entail dancing or pretending to be an athlete, the guy can bring some talent to the table. As the one who sees a future for himself in the army, unsure whether to pursue it or to stay with the people he promised five years prior, he shows the conflict and inability to be the person he wants to be and the one they want at the same time. All his feelings towards Phillippe for his abandonment are true and I feel the only thing that is at all times real. This character is what kept me from completely writing the film off as anti-war propaganda. He knew his job and saw what fighting the law could do to those close to him. He must watch the world implode while his best friend leaves him to clean up his mess. It's a turn that I wasn't quite sure he had in him and maybe will make me buy into some of his hype.",8,4,10,29 March 2008
Deja Vu," U can save herDéjà Vu
","It's a real shame that everything I had read about Déjà Vu concerned the high-powered explosions and loud clatter of guru/producer Jerry Bruckheimer. No mention, except maybe as a footnote, was given to A-list director Tony Scott and the magic he has woven in his past three films. The man who brought us Top Gun has seen a sort of revival in style lately with the entertaining Spy Game, the amazing Man on Fire, and the kinetic Domino. Scott has taken the quick cuts of music videos and has infused them into his shooting style. His editor better be making some good money as these films fly by with filters, jump-cuts, grain, and camera angles swiveling at every turn. Greatly overshadowed by brother Ridley Scott and his more serious, award-winning epics, Tony has been pumping out some of the most solid and entertaining films of the past couple decades. With a reuniting of semi-regular star Denzel Washington, Déjà Vu proves that when Bruckheimer is paired with a like mind, his usual drivel can become great. Scott shows us how to hone the explosions, noise, and clutter to an effective level and gives us a helluva ride.Déjà Vu could have easily reduced itself to timetravel farce, going by the books to show a time warp in order to solve a crime. The far-fetched premise of being able to see the past as it happens four and a half days later should seem crazy and by watching the previews you are given the idea that it will be just a series of do-overs. Fortunately the trailers these days show a totally different movie than what has been crafted. Scott and his screenwriters have not only developed a sci-fi tale seeped in enough reality to at least be looked upon as plausible for the sake of the story, but they nicely tidy up any chance of their being a plothole. Our story begins with a devastating domestic terrorist act upon a ferry carrying over 500 people, Navy and family. Washington's ATF agent is brought in and discovers that it was no accident. Intrigued by the efficiency he displays, an FBI agent, played with nicely effective restraint by Val Kilmer, calls him in to check out a new toy they have to find who the perpetrator is. During the use of this screen of the past, Denzel acquires a feeling of obligation to do all he can to prevent what he sees from occurring in the present, no matter what consequences that might entail for the future. The quest to stop the violence begins with an attractive young woman who unknowingly has become an integral part in what will ultimately transpire.The beauty of this film is that with multiple timelines being shown parallel to each other, there are many questions that desperately need answering. To credit all involved, they appear to have put themselves in the audience's shoes and piece-by-piece wrote in a reason for everything. Anything that is seen either in the past, present, or future has a reason for being there and will be intelligently explained. Also, the performances are stellar, Denzel and Kilmer as well as a quietly maniacal Jim Caviezel and the emotionally exasperated Paula Patton, and the visuals unique. While Scott has toned down the ultra-kinetic cuts and filters for the main action, his style is still stamped on the graphics of their screen showing the past. The motion trails and speed scans lend a stylized digital editing program feel and are gorgeous to watch. Déjà Vu's best sequence, however, is the crazy car chase during the present in pursuit of a vehicle in the past, definitely a rush and orchestrated almost flawlessly. Even though Ridley gets the accolades and Tony gets the hack/overproduced label, I must say, while they are the best directing duo in Hollywood, I might have to give the edge on pure cinematic entertainment to the younger Tony. He is on a roll and doesn't seem to be stopping anytime soon.",9,265,366,24 November 2006
In Bruges," You got to stick with your principlesIn Bruges
","I think that I will shortly be purchasing the Oscar winning short film Six Shooter from 2004. I've got an iTunes gift card for just the job. The thought occurred to me after seeing the wonderful debut from director Martin McDonagh, In Bruges. After seeing the trailer, which really worked for me, many times and wondering at how it is from an Oscar winning director yet never hearing of the name, I did some research. While he already has more little gold men than Alfred Hitchcock, his actual feature premiere is what has opened this weekend. It is Irish, most definitely, and if you have trouble with the accent, maybe you should steer clear until in comes out on DVD, however, if you can cope, this is a smart pitch black comedy. When I say pitch black, I mean black hole expanse of darkness. The trailer leads you to believe it will be an uproarious time, and while it is very funny and very smart, there is a tragic event that is held over the proceedings, lending a somber shadow over all that occurs. In the end though, it is consistent with its wit and drama, telling an intriguing story and never relying on the laughs to hide any plot point that the creators may not have wanted to work out to completion.If I am to gripe about anything, it will be the ending. Not the very end, however, as that is absolutely perfect. The camera-work, voice-over, and final shot cannot be argued, it is the climax that happens just before that rings false. It is the only moment like that, though, so I don't hold it against the film. McDonagh needed a way to get his characters to their arc's conclusions and if that means turning one of the roles, at first seeming to be there for jokes, into a pawn for a symmetrical kind of convenience, I'll give him that reprieve. As far as fitting with the story, yeah it works; it has to because the incident is alluded to unknowingly at many times during the course of the sightseeing romp. I guess I think it fits too well and wish McDonagh could have come up with another way to do it.Besides that, though, In Bruges is a great time at the theatre. Colin Farrell is steadily becoming a favorite of mine with his precise comic timing and broad facial expressions. I may be one of the few people on earth that loved his comedic turn in Woody Allen's Cassandra's Dream, (yes I truly believe the comedy was intentional), and here he shows it was not a fluke. Kind of similar to his scene-stealing role in Intermission, he is a punk with a lousy disposition and disregard for tact. Here, however, he also has a conscience. This tug-of-war is ripe for laughs as he is a sweet guy, he just doesn't know how to keep his mouth shut. One-liners are in abundance and you will be laughing continuously. Brendan Gleeson helps this fact by being an effective straightman to play off of. He knows the score and tries to enjoy the 'fairytale' city while his cohort sulks and puts on 'moods like a five year old' because, honestly, unless you grew up on a farm and were slightly retarded, Bruges is really just hell on earth. (Actually, the city looks pretty great and I wouldn't mind checking it out once in my lifetime.) The periphery roles, and there are many, also add depth and interest to the film. Small characters like Eric Godon's alcove loving gun dealer, Jordan Prentice as a horse-tranquilizer taking midget actor (he played Howard the Duck, that is awesome), and Clémence Poésy as the love interest and enigma Cholë all are fun and never quite feel just thrown in as jokes, but instead integral parts to the story. Of course, the great Ralph Fiennes is involved too. His accent and vocabulary rivals Ben Kingsley in Sexy Beast and unfortunately is a much smaller part than anticipated from the trailer. Well maybe not unfortunately, because if he was in more it might have become a gimmick. I also couldn't help stop thinking of Harry Potter with Mad-Eye Moody, Lord Voldemort, and Fleur Delacour all involved.I highly recommend this film for anyone looking to see a good drama with comic overtones. Don't go in thinking this is to be a total good time, with laughs a minute, there is so much more to the tale that you may not expect or necessarily be hoping for. At times it is very dark and drains every molecule of happiness out of your heads, but thankfully a good joke or line will be coming shortly to alleviate the depression.",8,199,262,23 February 2008
Kung Fu Panda," Can you handle the crazy feet?Kung Fu Panda
","Pixar is where it is at for me animation-wise in Hollywood. Maybe that makes me a snob, but something about their films resonant on a level that the others can't even begin to touch. Sure Shrek and Madagascar are funny, but besides the off-belly laugh, they are kind of shallow and hollow. With that said, I went to check out Dreamworks new foray into computer graphic cinema, Kung Fu Panda. Admittedly, I knew very little about this thing other than the fact that Jack Black and Angelina Jolie voiced characters. It could possibly be due to the fact that I don't watch much TV, but I've seen sparse promotion at best until walking into the theatre and seeing a giant 3D panda in the lobby. On the whole, the film plays out much like you'd want a family/kid friendly picture to. We are given examples of friendship, belief in oneself, and humilityall life lessons we hope to inspire our youth with. With a good backbone such as that, along with some humorous bits and stunning action choreography, this panda definitely packs a punch doing his job: entertaining the audience right until the final frame.Credit the producers for compiling a top-notch roster of vocal talent to enhance the somewhat ho-hum script. These types of movies are never very original, so it takes a bit of extra panache to really draw me in. Black is actually quite good in the role and Po the panda plays right into his schtick. When arriving at the hall of warriors, he goes to every artifact and does his thing, screaming his excitement at all the cool stuff like it's his JB character from Tenacious D eying Jimi Hendrix's first guitar. The Kung Fu arm mannerisms even recall his air guitar/rock n' roll motions. Black is somewhat restrained and his manic energy is reigned in to be effective on the comedic and dramatic levels. This guy is, after all, our entrance into the story and the character we are supposed to relate to. An outcast and an original, we all can see a bit of ourselves, always dreaming but never taking the leap to achieve those goals. We watch his evolution and start to believe that it could happen to us too.It is a fine line for the supporting roles. A Panda with historical knowledge of the ancient art yet without any actual experience has been proclaimed the savior of the valley against a monster of a foe. He is truly the ugly duckling and all those around him must straddle the division of chiding him and the absurdity of the situation, but not be too meanthere are kids watching. In order to keep a good grasp on this tenuous situation, the filmmakers cast a group of affable people with the ability to work in serious moments, but never relinquish the humorous edge to their voice. Guys like David Cross, Seth Rogen, and Jackie Chan are perfect for the roles of the true warriors attempting to reconcile their preconceptions of this screw-up swooping in and taking their thunder. Moments like the acupuncture scene really show this to be true. Jolie is good as Tigress, another fighter and prize student, but the role ends up being pretty forgettable and by the books. She never really gets the range to go crazy. Neither does Dustin Hoffman as the master and teacher to them all, yet he is a still a success. My favorite supporter was the great Ian McShane as Tai Lung, the villain of the tale. No one has a better voice for nefarious deeds than this guy and he delivers continuously.As far as the story goes, it is a nice tale to teach the kids about faith and comradery. For us older folk, however, we are treated with some spectacular action/battle sequences to satisfy our want for more than just preaching. The chopstick fight between Hoffman and Black is fantastic, having comedy and tenacity with some nice artwork and fast paced movement. The battle on a rope bridge towards the end, as well as the final confrontation, is also highly enjoyable. Credit the entertainment to the acting and a gimmick that at first made me cringe. Throughout the film we are treated with slow-motion insertions during the action. A nod to old Kung Fu films and the satirical spoofs created as a result, I was thinking I'd grow tired of the maneuver very fast. Fortunately, as the movie continues on, the moments become sprinkled in with perfect timing. The escape from Rhino prison wouldn't have been half as fun without the speed changes in the action and the slow-mo facial expressions of those getting thrown around. Even towards the end, the filmmakers began to use it as an original comedic device. Capturing Po's reaction to a charging Tai Lung is absolutely priceless.Kung Fu Panda is by no means a masterpiece, but for a cartoon that really flew under my radar, I had a lot of fun taking part in the experience. Right from the beginning, with a stylized 2D rendered sequence as an introduction, I saw that this wouldn't be quite the run-of-the-mill work I was anticipating. Always staying fresh and funny I can fully endorse anyone wanting to check it out as a nice appetizer to what could be a fantastic main course in Pixar's Wall-E come this summer.",7,14,29,31 May 2008
I'm Not There," Tangled Up In BlueI'm Not There
","Todd Haynes has used the life and music of singer Bob Dylan in order to composite a tale of his many selves in I'm Not There. I know little about the director, besides the names and accolades thrown towards his previous two theatrical works, and besides liking Dylan's songs, I'm not privy to a huge wealth of information on him. There were some rudimentary tidbits, which I found hidden in my head during the film from my Rock'N'Roll Music History class in college, but I think if I knew more I would not have enjoyed the surrealistic journey close to as much as I did. This is not a masterpiece in the complete sense of the word. As an experiment, however, it is a fascinating look into the life of a man that changed his image so often and never conformed to be the person that his fans wanted him to be. Having six characters play him at different periods of his creative journey shows the inventiveness put on display. There is nothing mainstream about the film, and that is a good thing. If I were to have one complaint, it would be the fact that it almost was not surreal enough. It was the overlapping that intrigued methe versions of his life through a young boy's love of Woody Guthrie and the anonymity of an older man's Billy the Kid. No disrespect to the four other personas, but they were just a tad too much impersonation, not enough creative representation.Haynes is definitely a gifted filmmaker. The compositions and transitions are remarkable and never static or boring. He keeps the tone consistent and never goes off track with the underlying theme he is conveying. Whereas a film like Across the Universe derailed at times, Haynes harnesses this one by always keeping us off-balance and not knowing what might happen next. The music didn't tell the story; it enhanced it. Showing more the time period of our current Dylan stand-in, the music never took the lead to overshadow the actors on screen. However, there are still some beautiful moments, like the funeral scene during the Billy the Kid thread. Although I liked the fact that the music didn't taken control in order to manipulate the audience, it is still the sequence that does which sticks with me the most.Our four major representations of Dylan are played by Christian Bale, Cate Blanchett, Ben Whishaw, and Heath Ledger. All do an amazing job, but their portrayals just seem too obvious. Maybe it was the technique used to show us their storiesI just wasn't as interested in them as the final two variations. Whishaw is my favorite impression, a talking head narrating, as though in an interview, enhancing the other segments with background information. Bale's section is the least successful, showing us his life as a Behind the Music segment, mostly from the mouth of Julianne Moore. It is too cold and calculated, with little to say except to give us the person for whom Ledger's Robbie acts as in a film, leading him to meet his wife played by Charlotte Gainsbourg. His section is nice, showing us the transformation that fame and wealth and social relevance wrought on his soul. Gainsbourg shines and really it is her reactions to Ledger that resonate. As for Blanchett, her piece is the iconic Dylanthe badass who went electric and left all his fans behind him. She is great as the worked up, most likely drugged up, Jude Quinn telling the world that his music only needs to be relevant to him. He will not be a puppet for the world; if you hate his stuff, don't listen to it.What got me drawn in were the more expressionistic moments. Marcus Carl Franklin is quite a find here as a young drifter, wandering the world with his music. Innocent and pure, copycatting his idol Guthrie, he is at the cusp of Dylan's first major transformation. With the death of the legend, he finally sees that it is time to become his own person and break through the barriers he has set up for himself. It was time to start singing about today's problems and help create change in society. He is also one of three instances to cross over into another version's story. Besides Ledger and Bale's roles existing simultaneously and Bruce Greenwood's oppressor manifesting in two separate stories, Franklin is seen entering Richard Gere's Dylan world, the other remarkable metaphor for the singer's life. As the real Billy the Kid, in hiding from the world and the authorities to live out his life in obscurity, he is brought back out to strike a change. One can't buckle to the pressures of outsiders and critics, but instead push through and continue to be innovative.These crossovers are great cinematic moments, helping bridge the gap between all six plot threads. Haynes made a bold move to tell the tale with fragmented personas overlapping and progressing. It is an idea that breeds surrealism and an ignoring of principles found in reality. I also loved his humor, bringing in the Beatles, Brian Jones, and a total mind-trip cameo by David Cross as Allen Ginsberg. I just wish Haynes would've gone full-bore into this parallel universe and not felt the need to every once in awhile bring us back to a realistic linear progression. The Bale/Ledger/Blanchett sequences do ground the story to be more comprehensible, but I almost would have rather been completely unaware of what I had just seen then leaving with the sense of understanding that I did. I caught a few references spiced in of song lyrics, and it's that stuff that I wanted more of. I hope Haynes continues to go in directions that are against the norm because when he does, he creates some marvelous scenes. He is on the right track, giving us a psychological insight into the timeline of one of America's greatest enigmas.",8,5,13,24 November 2007
Star Trek," You can whistle real loud  Star Trek
","Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman showed they could do serious action with Mission Impossible III, but the campiness of Transformers gave me trepidation that their reboot/prequel Star Trek might lose its way. However, with a guy like J.J. Abrams at the helm to steer the ship, I never should have lost faith. The origin story for all your favorites like Kirk and Spock is everything you'd hope it could be. The humor is great, the effects spectacular, the acting really good, (thank you for not making Chris Pine do a William Shatner caricature), and the story intricate in its own rite, being deeper than just a throwaway film to introduce people and set up a sequel. And who would have thought Karl Urban and Simon Pegg shouting out fan favorite lines as Bones and Scotty respectively could actually fit in and not seem forced or cheesy. Star Trek is back and better than ever; good job Paramount for giving the con to an admitted Trekkie novice who's outside perspective was just what the series needed.In any lesser hands, Star Trek could have fallen prey to the origin story syndrome of so many, spending too much time on characters that most know a lot about, leaving the plot and ultimate climax to suffer. How many times do you get a great story full of exposition only to see a beloved villain get wasted in the first film, with an epic battle becoming little more than a whimper? Orci and Kurtzman seem to understand this fact and therefore create a whole new creature to act as antagonist. Captain Nero is a Romulan who has accidentally been sent from the future through a black hole, looking for revenge on the man he holds responsible for the annihilation of his home world. He is a wild card unknown to the Federation, someone with a superior ship and weapons, a force for which no plans exist to confront him. He is the perfect adversary to help vault James Tiberius Kirk into the Captain's chair on the Starship Enterprise. Nero can't be reasoned with, he must be reacted to in kind, with as much improvisation as possible. No one is better at going into a fight undermanned and underpowered, yet still feeling as though he has the advantage, than Kirk.But even though he is an egomaniac, too smart for his own good and bad boy demeanor, he must learn to trust and rely on those around him, even if they disagree. Not having ever watched the original television series, but having seen a couple of the films, I always did found it interesting that someone so cavalier as Kirk could be so close of friends with a Vulcan like Spock, pretty much unemotional, by the books, and unrelenting in his logic. Here we get the answers. We learn about Spock's interspecies parents—Vulcan father and human mother—and how the two races have affected his internal structure and emotional gauge. We also see Kirk's hardnosed childhood without a father in backwoods Iowa, a chip perpetually on his shoulder. It is an adolescence brought on by the ripple through time Captain Nero has caused, coincidentally being the direct reason for Kirk's father's death in this alternate reality. Whereas 'Lost' posits that the past cannot be changed, Star Trek not only says in can, but also does so without warning. The crewmembers you know from old discover each other, find their way onto the Enterprise through aptitude or sheer dumb luck, and discover the strengths they each possess, forming the bonds and work ethic that will keep peace in the universe for years to come.The real success stories come from our trifecta of leads, Chris Pine's Kirk, Zachary Quinto's Spock, and Eric Bana's Nero. Bana brings some real malice to the role of the villain. He is an imposing figure, even more so with his introduction at the start, brooding in his chair while his right-hand man, played by Clifton Collins Jr., does the talking before he strikes. Quinto was a no-brainer choice to play Spock as his Sylar from 'Heroes' contains similar mechanics and streamlined actions. You do miss the sly smirk that that character brings, but the tumultuous conflict of emotions battling each other behind Spock's eyes show the fire inside—the human part of him unwilling to stay buried. Watching him be so matter-of-fact with lines such as 'I'm not familiar with humans' idea of the prank' elicits many laughs, but never at the character's expense. And Pine really shows what he is made of here. A badass, smart mouthed, punk hiding a mind and willingness to lead, his Kirk couldn't be better. With some great one-liners and perfect timing, you really start to like this kid and understand why he will become the great leader he does. You even see a little of Shatner in the role—and that's a good thing, especially since oddly timed verbal pauses weren't necessary to do so.Star Trek is everything it has been built up to be. A worthy addition to the series and possible frontrunner quality-wise to the rest, Abrams has restarted the franchise and I'm sure reinvigorated the public's want for the Federation. I hope the cast and crew continues to create more, as long as the professionalism and strong storytelling stays intact. If you want story, action, science fiction, or just some good ol' Trekkie fun, go out and see it now because it's all included. All the characters are present, each developing and honing the quirks and idiosyncrasies we've grown to love from them. Not to mention many a fanboy's dream in seeing Leonard Nimoy play opposite Quinto, passing the torch onto a new generation. Television be damned, Star Trek may have some legs to make many more films, keeping the tradition alive while earning new, younger fans. This world has some more life in it after all.",9,2,8,11 May 2009
Inglourious Basterds," F*ck a duck!  Inglourious Basterds
","Beautifully shot, meticulously orchestrated, and lyrically scripted, it is Tarantino's answer to friend Paul Thomas Anderson's There Will Be Blood; a statement that says 'anything you can do, I can do better'. Is it better? Now that is a tough question, one that numbers cannot truly define. Is it QT's self-proclaimed masterpiece as he so shamelessly alludes to with the last line of dialogue? I still say Pulp Fiction can't be beat, but this one definitely makes me take pause.What I love about Tarantino is his fresh, smart, and generally amusing as hell dialogue. Each film he has written bears his voice and excels as a result. However, as each entry to his oeuvre is made, the sequences seem to go longer and longer. It started with Kill Bill and continued to the extreme in Death Proof with overlong passages that, while not petering out towards the end, definitely contain some dead spaces. The 153-minute runtime here doesn't necessarily feel long, yet also doesn't hide itself. Rather than a feeling of boredom, I was anxious to get to the next scene, to see what would result from the previous instance of gravitas. Because this movie is chock full of tense plot points of huge importance. Not one second is wasted, (well, maybe the unnecessarily hokey titlecard to usher a quick film reel history of Hugo Stiglitz and the other Sam Jackson narrated vignette about nitrate film), and the weight of every word and pause is felt. Were scenes drawn out, needing a trim here or there? No. If anything they were just so tightly wound that I couldn't breathe or wait from the anticipation of what was to come. I'm not quite sure if that is praise or criticism because, while taking me out of the film, I don't think I'd have wanted it any other way.Oddities aside, (the Stiglitz freeze-frame wasn't the only instance of font overkill—did we really need to know the names of the men in the theatre suites?), this is vintage Tarantino pastiche. Right from the start, you aren't quite sure what is going on. Denis Menochet's Perrier LaPadite is shot with stoic strength, deliberately moving as he watches Nazi soldiers approach his house. Reminiscent of a Western standoff, the scene is accompanied by a reworked classical music piece I couldn't quite put my finger on, and the close-ups and camera angles made me look to see when Menochet and Christoph Waltz's Col. Hans Landa would inch their hands close to their gun holsters for a quick draw. Instead, we get a pipe juxtaposition showing the dearth of proximity their two classes are in—French milk farmer and German SS Colonel. The scene sets the stage for what is to come, showing the incident that ultimately leads to the revenge bent at the film's core while also showing us the cucumber cool and sarcastic wit of Waltz's Landa, by far the most interesting creature playing amongst the hyper-reality at hand.The trailers harp on the Basterds themselves far too much because they are, to me, the least interesting plot thread. Yes, Brad Pitt is fantastic—the coarse Southern accent, the ruggedness complete with horrific neck scar, and the blank-faced comedic timing with his atrocious Italian and matter-of-fact dialogue delivery; and yes, Eli Roth is so over-the-top you can't help but love 'The Bear Jew' without remorse. His lack of acting skill is quite obvious, but his exuberance and intensity more than make up for it. I also really enjoyed Til Schweiger's Stiglitz, the consummate badass out to kill the bad guys, no matter what side he is on. But, once the initial joy of their brutality and humor dissipates, you realize how thin their role really is. Bounty hunters sent on behalf of the American army, they are out to kill Nazis by maiming, branding, and butchering—mindless fun for sure; intelligent storytelling, not so much. No, that aspect is brought to form by Mélanie Laurent's Shosanna Dreyfus, once a Jewish girl in hiding, now a woman hiding in plain sight with fake name and papers and a movie theatre to run. By sheer coincidence, (dumb luck?), or divine intervention, the people responsible for her family's massacre not only come to her door, but the man who ordered the killing arrives himself, making it all too easy a decision on whether to host a propaganda premiere for 'Nation's Pride', a filmed reenactment of German hero Fredrick Zoller and the one against three hundred odds he overcame.The conspiracies that form around this premiere, whether between Shosanna and Daniel Brühl's smitten Zoller or with Diane Kruger's German actress traitor Bridget von Hammersmark and the Basterds, by way of British infiltrator Archie Hicox, a fun turn by Michael Fassbender, are what resonate. Remembering the scene at a French restaurant between Waltz and Laurent still gives me chills as this woman must control her emotions while sitting across from the man that killed her brother, (what a release at its conclusion), as does the tense basement bar rendezvous between Kruger, Fassbender, and a bunch of Germans on leave to celebrate one's newborn son. It all culminates with Chapter Five, an exercise in sheer cinematic brilliance, from its wondrous opening with Laurent set to David Bowie's 'Cat People', to its mix of drama and laughs from Waltz, to its intensity in Roth's malice, to the massacre of guns, fire, and bodies that ensues. It is poetry in blood and never ceases to amaze, right down to its blatant disregard for historical accuracy. Much like Tarantino's earlier work that took existing films and appropriated that which he needed to tell the messed up stories in his head, Inglourious Basterds starts with the French occupation background of WWII and springboards out to carnage, espionage, and fiction. The man has style and it is all his own. Welcome back QT and hopefully we can expect a new singular vision sooner rather than later.",9,1,6,26 August 2009
Coraline," Great, the village stalker  Coraline
","OK America, before you go blindly into an animated film with your young children, why don't you do a little research on what they are about to witness. A PG rating and stop-motion animated aesthetic do not always make a child-friendly adventure. Based upon the horror novella by acclaimed author Neil Gaiman, Henry Selick's Coraline is chockfull of heavy material, dark story threads, and bleak possibilities. For a guy like me, those things equal undivided success; for a child aged ten, those things equal nightmare filled evenings and parents writing angry letters to Focus Features for subjecting their children to lewd and horrific imagery. Well guess what parents? No one is to blame but you. I'm not saying keep all youngsters away, but do use some discretion on whether your son or daughter can handle the fantastical elements. This is very much Alice in Wonderland displayed in all its non-Disney possibilities. A cautionary tale on being careful what you wish for, our heroine must discover the difference between a world of people neglecting her and that of people doing all they can so that they may give her all she could ever want in the future. Life is not about getting it all right now, but instead a slow and steady climb built on love and trust, one whose benefits far outweigh the whirlwind romance that is never truly as it seems.Remember folks, this is a story that won the 2002 Bram Stoker Award for Best Work for Young Readers; it's not all sing-songy like Selick's masterpiece A Nightmare Before Christmas. With that said, however, it is very, very good in a very, very different way. Be prepared for a methodically and deliberately paced story. More psychological terror than jump out at you scares, the tale of Coraline escaping into a parallel world, perfectly mirrored of her own only inhabited by animated dolls, is one of enlightenment and discovery of what love truly means. Do we all want the parents that dote on us? The guardians that will do what we want and when we want it? Of course we do. But that idyllic utopia doesn't exist, especially in the times for which we live today. Children need to be raised and supported and that takes money and a lot of hard work. What may seem like neglect in the eyes of a child is really two people doing all they can, sacrificing their time, in order to give him/her a chance at success. Only when Coraline sees the manipulation and truth behind the 'kindness' her Other-Mother gives her does she realize what she has back at home.What we are shown is a world through a tiny door in the wall of an old triple-segmented home. There are stories about this door used to explain the disappearances of some local children, including the sister of loudmouthed and shy Wybie Lovat's grandmother. Only a weathered black cat appears to know what is going on, what the too good to be true farce beyond the door is actually masking behind it. This cat can travel between worlds and therefore knows it all, allowing him to warn Coraline by orchestrating events via those she encounters. A disgruntled child is easily malleable and fooled when doted upon and given sweets and a smile. The mantra 'never talk to strangers' is never more applicable than it is here. With something a tad off-kilter in the fantasy world, Coraline finds herself shaking it off and relishing the opportunity to experience all that she had dreamed of, not knowing that if her parents succeed with their new gardening catalog, those dreams will be fulfilled in reality. Patience is a virtue and youngsters unfortunately don't learn that fact until they are all grown up, finding ways to apologize to their parents for being such confused and naïve monsters.With some very nice voiceworkDakota Fanning shines as our titular heroine; Keith David's baritone brings the cat's mixture of foreboding and help to life and Robert Bailey Jr. gets the nervous tick and stammer on the nose for Wybie, (short for WhyBorn, now that's a name you hope your parents never considered)you do find yourself enveloped in this world. A rare thing for an animated film to begin with a cast listing, it thankfully doesn't detract from the escapism by making you think of the actor rather than the character. This fact works best with the mother, played by Teri Hatcher. I would never have been able to pick her voice out, but that just enhances it all the more, breathing life into the stop-motion clay form on screen, becoming the wolf in sheep's clothing villain necessary for it all to work.Definitely soak in the aesthetic and intelligent storytelling as Coraline is for a thoughtful audience willing to delve deep into metaphors and hidden meaning. There is no 'approved for your Attention Deficit Disorder child' stamp of approval here. In much the opposite direction, don't be surprised if your child hates you for making them sit through it. However, it is a tale that will resonate for a portion of the public, hitting on their own feelings of selfishness and wanting the spoils without the work. When your child is intellectually mature enough to handle a rich and deep story, you as a parent will know. When he or she can see a couple of big-bosomed, large older women dressed as mermaids with pasties and not laugh or get uncomfortable, that is when you should let them see Coraline. It is ultimately a film for all ages; one that shows you as adults how it all will get betterjunior will one day understand the sacrifices you are makingand you children a fantastical world to escape to with consequences that will shake you into the realization of what you have right in front of you at home.",8,231,306,6 February 2009
Forgetting Sarah Marshall," I'll equalize youForgetting Sarah Marshall
","Forgetting Sarah Marshall had all the potential to fall into one of two camps: unbridled raunchy fun a la 40 Year Old Virgin and Superbad or sentimentality masked as comedy like Knocked Up. I had all the fear that it would hit the latter taking the sensitive guy with the broken heart too far into romance territory, letting the laughs fall by the wayside once the conclusion comes along. Thankfully, though, while the train took some turns down that path, writer/star Jason Segel knew what he was doing and threw in a curveball joke to right the ship at each instance. Rather than attempt to be two kinds of films at once, I believe this was a true hybrid of the two sides of the Apatow machine. You will not be free from laughter for long stretches here as the balance between big laughs and sappy melodrama is always tempered by subtle jabs, fantastic one-liners, and a crew of really likable actors having fun.This film also shows society a lesson on human anatomy. It is quite interesting how different reactions nudity can elicit depending on the sex of the person exposed. If the audience sees breasts on screen they get quiet as they are watching what is probably a love scene. However, once you get male genitalia in frame, everyoneand I mean everyonecannot stop themselves from laughing. Let's just say there are a lot of laughs of this fashion, so if that may detract you from seeing the film, be warned, but really it is only used to add one more layer of absurdity to seemingly tired situations and in my opinion works brilliantly. One has to respect this clan of artists under Apatow's wing for pushing boundaries and being willing to go for the joke without a second thought. It's one thing to be sexual and explicit just to say you are, it's another to use it in order to enhance the plot and the scene, sticking to your vision and not straying unnecessarily.What really becomes apparent is how these guys have found a way to understand today's comedy and their ability to turn a common, simple plot structure into something fresh and entertaining. Guy loses girl, guy tries to get away only to find that his safe haven is also where she is with her new boyfriend (wow haven't seen that before), guy falls for new girl while old girl realizes how stupid she was, and the end is the end (not to spoil anything directly, but I'm sure you can figure it out). It is all in the details and the gaps between the lines where the true genius manifests itself. Segel has joined Apatow and Seth Rogen in their ability to make a laugh-a-minute riot with a complete story and not simply a string of gags loosely jumbled together. Don't get me wrong, there are many gags and I'm sure many moments that were thought of previously and added to the script where they fit, but that is the thing, they all fit like a glove. It can't be easy to weave together a Dracula rock opera, complete with huge payoff at the end; a pig roast, ('Don't make me do thisI'm sorry!'); a sexually inexperienced newly wed couple; the wonderful features on new Mac computers; and the secret to good surfing technique, ('No, too much movement, do nothingnow stand'), but Segel deftly does the job.As for the players, I will admit to knowing little to nothing about all the principals. Segel is great in this role, but that should be no surprise since he wrote the part for himself based on real-life experiences, (if it's true that the breakup scene while naked actually happened to him, kudos for letting a situation like that be permanently etched onto celluloid). As for the women, both Kristen Bell and Mila Kunis do well attempting to break free from their TV show pasts. I'm not a big fan of Bell at all, but she is perfect in this role as the somewhat bitchy celebrity unaware of how vain she is. Maybe my somewhat undeserved hostility towards her made it feel that much more real. As for Kunis, I was completely surprised by how likable she was. Even when she snaps at one point into a curse-laced tirade, she is still the cutest thing in the world. Also, her chemistry with Segel is completely believablethe attraction through minds and sensibilities as the two are kindred souls finding exactly what they need from each other. The real surprise, though, is Brit Russell Brand. This guy owns each of his scenes with a self-effacing role of utter rockstar stupidity, played absolutely straight. He portrays the cool guy swagger to perfection and mixes in the awkward doltish sensibilities most stereotype his kind with. Segel's interaction with him on the ocean is the best example of how out there this guy is, yet when it comes to music he really does know what he is doing (regardless of his laughable songs).It is not going to be a comedy classic like Virgin, but it also won't be thrown aside as a failed attempt to give a rom-com broad comedic appeal like Knocked Up is with me. Instead it walks the line with a few missteps crossing other both ways. Each time it goes astray, in either direction, it finds it's footing quickly to right the scale. With the help of cameos from Jonah Hill, Paul Rudd, and Davon McDonald, one can't languish in the sentimentality for too long because those crazy characters won't let you. Forgetting Sarah Marshall delivers on the Apatow name and shows that Jason Segel shouldn't be relegated to only standing in Seth Rogen's shadow; he may be able to cast his own soon enough.",7,6,15,18 April 2008
Shaun of the Dead," Don't forget to kill PhilipShaun of the Dead
","Anticipating the release of Hot Fuzz has made me want to see the Simon Pegg/Edgar Wright career works. Having heard how great the UK series 'Spaced' was, I bought an import from Britain and just recently finished it. The show was great, pop culture abounds, hilarity from start to finish, and much like 'The Office,' they knew when to stop and not let the show take a fall with filler and repetitioncoughUS 'The Office'cough. What better segway from those two seasons then to go right on to the crew's first feature film, Shaun of the Dead. Now, I own a lot of movies on DVD, and as a result don't get to watch them often, and in some instances have never seen them yet. However, I must have watched Shaun four or five times in the past three years. I find the humor great and the characters well fleshed out and just having a blast with each other. It never gets tiring for me.Director Edgar Wright shows the ability to appropriate camera shots from other films, like he did with the numerous homage moments in 'Spaced,' and also a deft handling of the medium, especially with the long one take of Shaun walking into the convenience store, (both times). The way he was able to recreate shots and moments from the beginning of the film, to later on is effective and funny. It's good to see that he has kept a working relationship with writer/actor Simon Pegg because the two go together brilliantly. Pegg co-wrote and starred in 'Spaced' with Jessica Stevenson, (included in Shaun with a small role). Pegg is naturally charismatic and has perfect comedic timing throughouthelped I'm sure by the fact he is usually playing against, best friend in real life, Nick Frost. The thing with Simon Pegg is that he isn't your usual comedian trying to show range; the guy really can act. He plays the serious moments with the right amount of emotion and reality, and his expressions are always true to the moment. Sure the physical comedy is there, but his characters always work so well without the gimmicks, that when the slapstick comes, it actually works.Wright and Pegg have definitely stamped themselves all over this film. Using their influences and love of the horror and comic genres, they have created a monster that stands all on its own. Equal parts spoof and real zombie scare-er, Shaun of the Dead is a genre masterpiece, breathing new life into a type of film which has been stale and redundant for the past decade or so, (besides the great 28 Days Later, which has a shot taken at it here). Besides the need for survival amongst the living dead, though, we also have Shaun's quest to become a man and sort out his priorities, the most important being getting his girlfriend Liz back. The fusion of this common romantic comedy plot device and its polar opposite, with horror, works surprisingly well both in the script and the acting. Whereas most horror films just make you bide time as each character is taken out one by one, we are treated here with a group of friends that truly care for each other and meet fate together rather than alone. These people know the genre and never stupidly go into a situation to conveniently be killed.The humor could never have been as successful as it was without some spectacular actors. Kate Ashfield, as Shaun's girlfriend Liz really adds depth to the film, playing the straight character to the many goofballs running around. I'm not familiar with anything else she has done, but I would assume it is mostly serious stuff as she is one of the few here not playing for laughs. Penelope Wilton is perfect as Shaun's mother and Peter Serafinowicz once again shows how he excels at playing pricks, (like his 'Spaced' character). Also, like so many films of this ilk, we need to have the token serious actor to give it some credibility. Bill Nighy is that person here and he definitely adds professionalism while fitting in naturally with the crazy cast.While this is Wright and Pegg's film, they never could have done it without the help of Nick Frost. For being a regular guy and best bud to Pegg while he was starting out in the industry, Frost landed an integral role in 'Spaced' on the behest of his friend. Pegg wrote into the series a character based on one of Frost's personas that he would do to get laughs. Knowing no one could do the role better, he got Nick into the show despite him having no acting background whatsoever. It was a fantastic move, because he is a natural and in Shaun shows the maturity and growth he has undergone. The guy is a full-fledged actor now and steals every scene he is in, while never being just a copy of his TV role. Frost has range and one of the best deliveries for comedic gems. The few times when the film started to lull, Frost was always there to save the day. Having a familiar rapport with Pegg also helps us believe their relationship and understand the two and where they are coming from. I can't wait to see what the Wright/Pegg/Frost trio can do to the buddy cop genre with this year's Hot Fuzz. If the trailers have anything to say about it, it should be on par with 'Spaced' and Shaun, if not exceed them both.",9,2,5,14 February 2007
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," Hide the rum
","Disney hit gold figuratively and literally in 2003 with a successful theme park ride adaptation. (While I loved the movie, please don't get me started on the whole adding Jack Sparrow to the attractions in Florida and California, thus ruining tradition and memories of childhoodit just hurts too much.) In the world of Hollywood today, we all knew that that success would lead to a franchise. It's a good thing that the filmmakers seemed to of had the same amount of fun as the audience because they are all back for more. People shouldn't be misinformed about this movie either, as it is the first part of a simultaneously shot two sequel setwhich one should know if they have turned on a television set these past two years, however, with the grumblings of 'I can't believe I paid 7 bucks for a trailer' by theatergoers after my screening, maybe reality TV really is ruining our youth. Anyways, the film does not have a clear-cut ending, but instead a fantastic cliffhanger for the next installment. Believe me now; if it's as fun and entertaining as this one, we are in for a fantastic trilogy.Johnny Depp is back embodying the pirate we love most. All his eccentricities are there along with the sharp wit and sarcasm. He plays off Orlando Bloom's Will and Keira Knightley's Elizabeth deftly and surely with amusing banter and bickering between the three. There are times when Bloom and Knightley falter, he not really impressing me in much other than the Lord of the Rings Trilogy and Kingdom of Heaven and her lapsing in parts where her reaction shots seem like she has broken character and is just slyly smiling at those speaking to her like it was a dead take. Depp however never breaks stride and proves once again to be the best character actor in Hollywood despite everyone's desire to make him a leading man. His search for the key to the 'Dead Man's Chest' again leads Jack along to save himself from revenge by those he's betrayed, while also leading him on a path to have an opportunity of redeeming himself and proving his friends' thin faith that his heart is true as warranted.The supporting players do a wonderful job throughout the film as well. Stellan Skarsgård is great as 'Bootstrap' Bill, Bloom's Will's father. Actors like him bring credibility to an adventure movie, as this performance proves. While brief, he plays an integral part to the plot and surely will have more screen time in the third film. Jack Davenport shows some range as a beaten man looking for redemption, a welcome contrast to his confident and regal Commodore Norrington from the Curse of the Black Pearl. It's a shame he isn't used more in US cinema as he always gives a good performance; we always have his British work like the seldom seen stateside, but quite good miniseries, 'Ultraviolet.' The fight scene between Depp, Davenport, and Bloom is a highlight of the film and never grows old, even when it appears like it should. Naomie Harris also does a nice job as the creepy, otherworldly mystic our band of pirates seek wisdom from. Our real-scenestealer, however, is Bill Nighy as the villain Davy Jones. Even under the massive amounts of CGI animation, we are still given a brilliant performance. All his facial ticks and expressions are apparent and even if one didn't recognize his voice, you could still tell who is playing him. Anyone who has seen him in Shaun of the Dead and especially Underworld, where he plays his vampire Viktor much the same way as Jones here, will know what I mean.As far as the effects go, the CGI is almost impeccable. The work done on the crew of the Flying Dutchman is amazing, with each actor having computer work mapped over their bodies. The sea-life textures are realistic and rival the effects work done on the cursed crew from the first film. Even the monstrous Kraken is rendered well. There are instances where it appears a tad cartoonish wrapping it's tentacles around ships, but the detail and sliminess of them close up is nice. One scene in particular is bad though, where a character towards the end faces the mouth of the monster. Our view is from behind the person looking at the gaping orifice, to see a flat wall. The feel is totally of a green screen as all sense of depth is dissolved. This instance is salvaged almost instantly, though, by the next cut, to a three- quarters view, where we are allowed to see the tentacles and teeth in defined planes of perspective in relation to the character, resulting in one of the best computer generated shots of the movie.Even though Dead Man's Chest does get darker and more gruesome than its' predecessor, director Gore Verbinski and his writing team retain everything from the original that worked and begin to build upon it. While one can't really judge this film quite yet without seeing the finale that awaits, it is still obvious that it delivers on all its promises. We are treated with an entertaining adventure film with all the trimmings: great acting, great writing, humor, romance, and superbly choreographed swashbucklin' action. It all culminates with an appropriately surprising cameo appearance, readying us and whetting our appetite for At World's End in May of next year.",8,1,5,22 July 2006
The English Patient," For the heart is an organ of fire  The English Patient
","The titular English patient is Count Laszlo de Almásy who we are introduced to as his plane is shot down in a fiery crash, leaving his entire body badly burned. It appears as though he has lost his memory too, except for an uncanny ability to name every song he hears. Almásy loves to sing, as he is told throughout the film, in both his past and present, so this trick is not too out of place. He is on his last leg, the crash left him close to death, and eventually the military caravan he is apart of goes on while he and his nurse stay holed up in an abandoned Italian Villa. The nurse, Hana, has seen her own bits of tragedy during the war as her love was killed and then her best friend, seconds after talking to her, is blown up by a land mine. Everyone she loves seems to be perishing around her, so to get away with her patient is an appealing answer to the grief and anger bottled inside. The two are very alike, especially after we hear Almásy speaking of his wife, who we can only assume was the woman in the plane with him when it crashes. We won't know the truth until we delve into the dreamstate memories of his past, the years leading up to the point he is at now. His days as a mapmaker in Africa and the affairs and dealings he participates in once the war breaks.There are a lot of timeline maneuvering, but it's always grounded through our lead character Almásy. Ralph Fiennes is either under burn victim prosthetics (the present) or shown whole in the desert (the past). The surrounding roles also help as we soon realize the instances with Kristen Scott Thomas delineate the past from those moments with Juliette Binoche's Hana, caring for our lead in Italy. The way Fiennes dreams all his flashbacks make it tough for we the audience to decide whether he has amnesia or is just faking it to try and forget the pastan idea set forth by Willem Dafoe's mysterious Caravaggio, a man that is not telling the complete truth, yet entrenching himself in the middle of the action. His past shows him in the deserts converting photographs into maps for the British army to use for the war that is brewing. It is a life of work amongst men and friends until a couple benefactors, one a photographer, come to visit. The arrival of Geoffrey and Katharine Clifton (Colin Firth and Scott Thomas respectively) turns the entire dynamic on its head. Fiennes' strict bachelor finds a woman who fascinates him. A strong, educated, and independent one that just might feel the same about him.This is not just any affair, though, but instead one with dire consequences. Those that Almásy and Katharine touch will all be affected because of the war and the sides that are forming. What was once a world of equality and kinship, with multiple ethnicities and nationalities all teaming up on the cartology project, becomes one of enemies and allies on opposite ends of a harsh brutal battle. The reverberations from their trysts are felt for years to come as grudges stay held and alliances are made. Why does Almásy keep referring to a wife when we know he never has one? What relationship does Caravaggio truly hold with him, if any? Why are he and Katharine flying in territory that risked them getting shot down and killed? There are so many questions for which hinge on Almásy remembering his past. We want him to remember because we want to know what happened to bring him to where he is, alone and disfigured, only wanting one more day in the rain before he dies.But it is not all about this journey. We also are treated to Binoche's Hana's evolution as a woman trying to survive a war that appears to kill everyone she holds dear. What was to be a retreat of isolation beside her patient becomes a boarding house for Dafoe's character as well as a team of bomb diffusers led by Naveen Andrews' Kip. Everyone's favorite Iraqi torturer from 'Lost' was billed higher than Firth in an Oscar winning film back in 1996. Where has he been since? I don't know, but I'm glad he has returned to the scene because he shows again here that he deserves to be. An Indian Sikh, he becomes the person that could show Hana she is not cursed. He can be a love that won't go away, one to break her from the shell she has hidden herself behind. Theirs becomes a relationship that mirrors Almásy's own with Katharine, allowing his thoughts to dwell on that happy time and eventually let spill what really happened.Six people's lives intertwine through over a decade in Europe and Africa, meeting accidentally and purposely with both large and small results. Each has a hand in the future of the other, whether they are aware of it or not. One move by any of them can be a life or death decision for the rest. As a result, this story could have become contrived to the point of absurdity in order to make it all happen. However, this fact is what makes the film so successful, because it never falls into that trap. The English Patient is natural and fluid throughout its lengthy duration with each coincidence and uncovered secret seeming to be as realistic as possible. I never once doubted the activities nor motives of any involved and while it may drag a bit around the hour and a half mark, the final 45 minutes or so make up for everything. Something can be said for the hidden truth being revealed after so much anticipation and buildup. Minghella took the novel and crafted a riveting piece of romantic drama, captivating its audience and delivering on every promise  absolutely.",9,3,5,26 October 2008
Hostel," Elite HuntingHostel
","I have to applaud writer/director Eli Roth for what he has created in Hostel. To me this film is not as much a horror flick as a thriller told with all the gruesome brutality intact. There are no scares, no haunting music crescendoing, and no jump in your seat moments that we expect from the genre. Yes, we get blood and gore and uncut severing of body parts, the film is definitely not for the squeamish, however, Roth tells it in such a way that we as an audience are involved and invested in these characters. We saw the torture in the previews and think this is what the movie will be in totality, when instead we are shown a couple of kids backpacking through Europe before grad school. These kids roam free until their better judgment lead them to their destruction.Jay Hernandez and Derek Richardson are perfectly cast. Hernandez's Paxton is ready for a good time, or as many as he can with as many different women possible; Richardson's Josh, on the other hand, has just broken up with his girlfriend and is reluctant to join in the fun. His nervousness is portrayed realistically and you can believe these two guys are old friends and have each other's backs. They even meet a horny Icelander Oli played with comic genius by Eythor Gudjonsson. He is a kindred spirit, although probably a decade older than the boys, and the three are having a blast in Europe when the suggestion of perfect, sex-crazed girls in Slovakia is dropped into their consciousness. They continue their trek east and all goes to plan, meeting two vixens, including the gorgeous, Monica Bellucci lookalike, Barbara Nedeljakova, who show them a good time. A good time, that is, until Oli goes missing and hell begins.Eli Roth has woven a suspenseful yarn that totally came out of left field. He shows us a more serious take on a premise like the comedy EuroTrip for the first forty or so minutes of a ninety-minute film. We know what is going to happen, and yet he teases us by giving the exact opposite to the gore we have come to see. This tactic allows us to settle in and get to know our protagonists, learn their backgrounds and motives. The attention to detail here makes what happens in the second and final act that much more visceral. These are innocents roped into an underground game of deception and profit. They don't deserve what is about to happen and we root for them that much more. Each small bit of exposition into their lives also pays dividends later on to help us cope with some of the things they do. Remember the memory shared by Jay Hernandez about a drowning girl from his past. This story helps setup why he does what he does towards the end. Old horror rules don't apply here, people don't act stupid and run towards the killers; they have distinct reasons for what they do and the entire film is carefully orchestrated as such.Other reasons to see the film include actor Jan Vlasák as the Dutch businessman our leads encounter on their journey east. He has the intellectual creepiness his character needs to be a success. The mannerisms and involuntary shake of the hands add substance and layers to a role that isn't explained as much as the others. Each action of his speaks louder than any words could. Also, the cinematography is worth watching on its own. We are treated viscerally by grimy, disease-infested scenery shrouded in darkness. Roth uses abstract angles throughout the film keeping the audience off-kilter and prone, so that the assault has the utmost impact. More than visuals, though, is the aural quality of many scenes. On multiple occasions we are stopped on static framing while the sounds of what's about to happen fill your ears. If you feel any fear during this movie it's in the anticipation perfectly laid forth by the sound preceding every act seen, as with thunder being followed by lightning.Hostel has everything you could want in a horror/thriller. The suspense is heavy and never overplayed to cause boredom from the waiting. I think this fact might actually hurt the planned sequel being written now by Roth. Hopefully the fact that he is continuing the story at the exact point the first ended will help in getting the audience involved right away; not having the same long period of setup before the payoff, making it essentially the same movie with different characters. Either way, count me in for part two. Any movie that includes great songs like the Sneakerpimps' How Do and pop culture cameos like horror-maestro Takashi Miike is good in my book.",8,5,8,23 July 2006
"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"," Once a king and queen of Narnia, always a king and queen of NarniaThe Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe
","I remember the Chronicles of Narnia by C.S. Lewis very fondly from my elementary school days. Never having read the Lord of Rings until college, once the films began to be made, Narnia was my one outlet into fantasy. Yes, there were a couple BBC productions that our librarian showed us while reading the epic saga, but being over a decade ago, having a reboot seemed like a perfect idea. Piggybacking on the fantasy train during the mid-2000's was a no-brainer and who better to direct than family friendly man Andrew Adamson? While, I guess there were probably a few that could come to mind considering he had never helmed a live action feature, (his two previous films were Shrek and Shrek 2). However, after viewing the filmtheatrical or extended as I viewed most recently for this reviewyou can't fault anything that goes on. The direction is great, the acting natural when dealing with leads of the age they are at here, special effects superb, and one can't fault the source material. Whether you take offense to the blatant Christian metaphors and Jesus-like events or not, don't let those preconceptions hold you back from watching the very well done piece of escapism cinema for the whole family that is The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe.The story is a tale of duty, courage, trust, and forgiveness. With World War II going on outside their house in Britain, the Pevensie children are escorted out of the city to the country home of Professor Kirke, (a wonderfully eclectic Jim Broadbent). While cooped up in his mansion, the kids decide to play games in order to stay sane, one of which is hide and seek. During the excursion, the youngest child, Lucy, discovers an old wardrobe, a perfect place to hide. Once inside, however, she discovers it is a pathway into a mythical land called Narnia. She meets a faun named Tumnus and learns about the White Witch who has taken over as Queen and shrouded the country in 100 years of winter. Only the true king, Aslan, can save them all from her medusa-like penchant to turn all enemies into stone and her utter disregard for anything good. As one would expect, upon her return, (hours in Narnian time, but only seconds in ours), the other children don't believe her tale at all. This dissension only adds to the rough relationships slowly burgeoning between the siblings, causing a rift in their solidarity and a way for the White Witch to work on young Edmund, (once all four kids arrive), he with the most anger and jealousy towards the others, to get the sons and daughters of Adam and Eve to be destroyed once and for all.Being a children's film above all else could hinder the emotional toll trying to be portrayed. Fortunately, this never becomes a problem. When there is battle and death, no blood is to be seenthis is not a Tolkien adaptation full of decapitations and gore. The warring sides contain talking forest creatures and mythical beings like dwarfs, centaurs, and phoenixes. Each is very well fleshed out and a true part of the proceedings, never appearing as more prop than character. They add to the immense accessibility for young children to find themselves drawn into the world and fight against the villains. The environment is handled deftly, winter is a luscious white and the transformation to spring is subtle and effective. Each detail is cared for, as there is not one instance for you to take a too close look and find yourself watching craft rather then story.Sure there is some great voice work from the likes of Liam Neeson and Ray Winstone, but it is the live actors that shine, whether in human form or fantastical. One of my favorite aspects of the film is Mr. Tumnus the faun played by James McAvoy. Not only is it mentioned for his real portrayal of all the emotions and inner wrestling with his heart and his fear, but also for the special effect work. Making his legs disappear into the hooves of a faun is very impressive and seamlessly done. Then you have Tilda Swinton as the White Witcha performance that I will admit could scare many a young child, and possibly a few adults too. She takes cold-blooded to new levels and her icy stare mixed with the false smile she uses to brainwash Edmund is great. Devious and purely evil, she carries each scene she is a part of.So, while Adamson has crafted winner, allowing all the pieces to fall together and be successful, he is not the last line in getting the rest of these books adapted to film. A lot must be put upon the four principal roles of the Pevensie children. If they are not believable, no one will take the time to see the rest that contain them, let alone the ones where people will have to be introduced to all new characters. Thankfully, these kids do the job and I can't wait to see how they handle the work in Prince Caspian, being that they will all be knowledgeable in the fact they were kings and queens, victorious in battle. This story is where they discover their heroism; the next is where they use it to battle evil once again. William Moseley and Anna Popplewell are the elder two, Peter and Susan, and while they can be a tad stiff at times, they do the job when needed. Skandar Keyne and Georgie Henley, as Edmund and Lucy, are the true finds. Both are natural and endearing, young children holding grudges and not thinking through their actions to their possible conclusions. They are fallible creatures and act as catalysts for much of the film. Never sticking out, nor showing their inexperience, these kids carry the film on their shoulders and prove that this franchise has only begun.",8,1,2,12 May 2008
Public Enemies," Bye-bye blackbird  Public Enemies
","I think Michael Mann is one of the good ones; even subpar fare like Miami Vice still seemed to contain what could have been a good film, hidden inside, just a few more edits away. So, when trailers for Public Enemies started dropping, with two stalwarts in Johnny Depp and Christian Bale, I was ready for a return to form. Unfortunately that is not what showed on screen. Instead, Mann once more seems to have overexerted himself by producing a bloated product with too many dead areas, virtually filming a vanity piece for Depp rather than a truly captivating tale. Comparisons to Ridley Scott's American Gangster kept entering the back of my mind, both derivative tales that try to be more than they are—perfectly adequate does not a classic make. John Dillinger is definitely an intriguing figure, a bank robber with a heart—sort of—but with a runtime over two hours, how often can we watch him rob a bank, risk his life, and get captured? The repetition becomes too much.It's a shame because, once again, there is a lot to like here. I feel Mann needs to step back and reevaluate his movies, taking a fresh look and seeing how he can excise all the superfluous fluff preventing the work from truly shining. The opening scene is fantastic. You assume it will begin with a bang, but in a bank, not at a jail during broad daylight. With the tone set and a rapid pace, I was ready for a thrill ride. However, the following scenes soon brought the speed down to the level it would stay for the duration. His chauvinism and unceasing confidence win over thieves everywhere as well as the heart of Frechette; it sadly did not win me over. Depp is great as Dillinger; the question becomes whether the character itself deserved such an epic tale. Giovanni Ribisi's crook arrives early on with a proposition of a big score for retirement, why must we have over an hour of filler before finally getting back to that plan? Maybe Mann felt we needed to see Dillinger's hubristic ways slowly destroy him, but starting the film without backstory and throwing us directly into the action is a measured choice, we as an audience expect to see his fall, we have no allusions that he will survive and ride out into the sunset. Starting so late in his 'career' tells us the end is nigh, there is no need to prolong it.And then there is Bale. Again, like Scott's longwinded opus of crime with Russell Crowe's detective role, while the character of Melvin Purvis may be the more interesting of the two, he is second fiddle at every turn. We all know the kind of badass Dillinger was, as well as his demise, but what about Purvis' conflicted mind when it came to killing rather than catching the criminals he hunted; what about the events that would ultimately lead to his own suicide? Bale is pushed to the background, utilized only as a villain to Depp's actual villainy. His shining moment comes with his ending Pretty Boy Floyd's, (I thought that was Channing Tatum, and it is), reign of crime—the first scene with him—a moment with absolutely nothing to do with Dillinger. The moments with he and Billy Crudup's J. Edgar Hoover fall flat, touching upon the bureaucracy that was letting these miscreants run free on the streets, but never approached the intrigue that the bad guys had. The jailbirds are just fun to watch as well as being a who's who of familiar faces.I guess my main gripe is in the title—Public Enemies. Well, where are the stories of everyone else? Okay, Floyd and Baby Face Nelson are included, but to what end? The first is shown only at his death and the other only as a loose cannon shooting anything in his path, (although I did enjoy Stephen Graham while eating dinner and being questioned in his hotel room). Mann should have called the film Dillinger and just made it into a biopic rather than pretending it was this huge crime drama about America's most wanted during the Great Depression. The film is at its best when Depp is on screen, especially opposite the wonderful Marion Cotillard who shows what got her the Oscar in 2008. It may be a thankless role, playing the waif, but she instills in Frechette strength of character, a longing for honesty even though she has involved herself with a bank robber. Depp shines in his relationships with cohorts and friends, never wanting to let any of them down  ever. Right from the start we see this, we see his eyes once a member of the jailbreak takes it upon himself to bludgeon a guard. There was not supposed to be any bloodshed and that incident ultimately leads to a friend's death, something unacceptable to him.Amidst the long-windedness and repetitive story structure lie some pretty impressive art direction and an aesthetic that portrays the 1930s to perfection. Depp's performance shows the notoriety he sought—it wasn't about killing or the rush of danger—he just really loved the spotlight of celebrity. His image was what mattered most, to the point where he allowed customers at the banks he robbed to keep their money. While not anywhere near a Robin Hood figure, he kept his spoils for himself; there really wasn't any malice in Dillinger, unless it was towards the police shooting bullets his way. Mann did a great job showing how America took to this man, not a murderer, but a showman, watching it all play out with wonderment rather than fear. Scenes of him holding a press conference upon his capture and seeing the awe in Emilie de Ravin's face when she is taken hostage express the glamour I believe Mann strived for. It's just a shame that the story surrounding that image was so dull to sit through otherwise.",6,1,2,10 July 2009
Bloody Sunday," It's just a nice Sunday strollBloody Sunday
","When Paul Greengrass was named as the new director in the Bourne series, people had no idea who he was. When he began filming United 93, people wondered what a Brit was doing telling the story of a plane full of American heroes. The answers to these questions always seemed to make mention of the film Bloody Sunday. That reasoning, upon seeing Greengrass's first major film, holds up strongly. What is now my favorite film of his, the story of that fateful day where a peaceful civil rights march ended in bloodshed and murder by the government, is portrayed as realistically and heart-wrenchingly as possible without it being actual documentary footage. It takes guts being English and deciding to take on a tale of injustice by his people over the Irish. When I saw United 93, I left the theatre thinking that no one could have done it any better; this film paved the way, ushering in a new artist able to put emotion and tragedy on screen without ever letting even one moment seem false.The hand-held filming technique that he has utilized so well in his subsequent films is on display throughout. Always inside the action, the camera follows Parliament member Ivan Cooper while he goes around Derry readying his constituents for their peace march to the civil rights rally. He is a man that is loved by all for both his charisma and his willingness to be among the people during their fight for the rights they deserve. The younger generation and high ranking members of the IRA know him and respect what he is doing, but they feel peace won't cause change, that they must fight fire with fire. Because of this, and some previous altercations that left British troops injured or killed, the English government has decided to go in and make an example of their power. What begins as a covert operation, to accompany their roadblocks and strong numbers around the town, with a mission to grab IRA members on their wanted list, soon escalates to a massacre of civilians at the hands of adrenaline pumping soldiers who had to wait too long to get out into the action.All the acting is phenomenal across the board. Young Gerry, played by Declan Duddy, has just gotten out of jail and decides to go with friends to the march, knowing he is risking getting caught again. Duddy does well portraying the love for his girlfriend and his desire to stay outside for her; he knows when he has gotten too close to the troops and tries to go with Cooper's group to the rally, but his mates won't let him. When his cousin is killed with a bullet from the troops, troops whom were supposed to be equipped only with rubber, all that goes away. The horror and shock of what has begun to transpire never leaves his face or actions and what eventually happens to his character is truly tragic and disgusting on the part of the British. On their side, both Nicholas Farrell and Gerard McSorley are great as the men behind the scenes, listening to what is happening on the streets. McSorley's police chief tries to tell Farrell that they should just let the march happen because the kids out there could be too dangerous otherwise. Farrell speaks of how they will use minimum force and throughout the course of events, he constantly tells his men to stand down while they take it upon themselves to move when they have the chance. He is powerless from his position and he knows what kind of tragedy has occurred and that it will end up being on his watch. Standing idle for too long made the soldiers antsy and when they had the opportunity they took it. After the incident, the conversations among the men are atrocious. Bragging about how many they got and the invigorating feeling of it all is appalling, however, not as bad as the one soldier among them who felt remorse at all points, even screaming about the ceasefire while his compatriots continued mowing down innocents. What he ends up doing could possibly be looked upon as worse than the men who actually killed people; his soldier that could have been a voice of truth ends up being a disgusting display of hiding ones' guilt.Shining above all, though, is James Nesbitt as Cooper. An actor that doesn't get enough recognition or work this side of the Atlantic, despite nice turns in Waking Ned Devine and Millions, he is fantastic. His modesty and compassion with the people is contagious at the beginning. He goes through the streets telling the troops that the march will be going, but it will be peaceful, and with every young hooligan he passes he goes to them and says to calm down and join their non-violent demonstration. He tries his hardest to use his political position to stop the riot that begins, but his idealism never prepares him for what happens. What began as Irishmen throwing rocks became two innocents shot down in cold blood. When the hooligans run away to the rally, all hell breaks loose with women and children needing to take cover from the gunfire. Nesbitt's reaction when his friend Barney tries to surrender is heart-breaking and when he goes to the hospital after it all, he is absolutely genuine in his grief. The glue that holds everything in the movie together, Nesbitt's concluding speech to the media is hard to watch. A man full of hope for freedom has finally had his eyes opened to the violence and physical tyranny at hand. He is correct when he says that the incident ended the civil rights movement, from that point on there could be no more peaceful marches. Bullets needed to be matched with bullets and young men on the fence of battle were finally swayed to join the war full steam ahead.",10,5,12,21 August 2007
Elizabeth," The Virgin QueenElizabeth
","With outstanding performances, lush settings and costumes, as well as a well-crafted story, this film does exactly what is needed for a biography to succeedand it sticks to a specific period of a legend's life, without trying to tell eighty years in two hours. Hers is a tale that many know, at least a trifle bit, about. From our introduction, writer Michael Hirst tells us exactly what is necessary to gage all our principal players. Elizabeth is a Protestant, thus a heretic to those in power. Her being an illegitimate heir, daughter of Ann Boleyn, those with aspirations to the crown, the Duke of Norfolk at the forefront, look to do all they can in order to remove her. Elizabeth is at first a child in love, given an opportunity to rule yet without the strength needed to make decisions based on her own sound judgment rather than those around her. While she is a woman, and even those who call themselves friends and allies can't shake that fact, in order to rule, she must be sure her mind is ruling and not her heart. Thus, we are shown the rise of a woman, whom no one thought able to survive a day on the job, who would soon vault her nation to be the wealthiest and most powerful in the world.Shekhar Kapur is blessed with a script from Hirst that gets everything right. We are taken through the journey of betrayals with little doubt or vagueness. All crossovers of allegiances, all attempts at deception in order to use her as a pawn for more power, and each action that slowly shows her what it means to be human and how even the most trusted of her peers can be bought and sold, are portrayed to the point. Everything in the world was stacked against the Queen whether it politics, religion, or love. While the script is devoid of excess, it is the direction that flourishes with style and radiance. From the castle interiors to the period dress, the film is precise in its recreation of the time. The words are perfect and the plot fast paced and exciting, but without the artistry to deliver it as such, no one would be talking about the end result nearly as much as they do. A good story may be enough for me, but it is the spectacle that allows it to succeed across the board.Besides the visuals, the main driving force at play is the career-defining performance from Cate Blanchett. It is this role that will always be synonymous with her name. To be able to show off the smile of a young woman attempting to keep her life together while it is swept away in the storm of responsibility for a nation is an amazing feat. Her virtue and faith in her own beliefs showed early on during her subjection to treason charges and almost execution at the hands of her half-sister, but they only fully show themselves at the end when she has finally excepted her duty above any earthly gains she might have otherwise. Only by secluding herself from the temptations of the flesh, or the heart of a woman, as some characters here would say, can she be strong enough to survive and protect her ward of England. The power that exudes from her being during the final chapter is immense. Some may say she became cold-hearted, but if you watch her performance carefully, you'll see that it is her love and that alone which enables her to do the things she does. Only love and faith could allow her to acquiesce to the deeds she knows must occur for her land to be safe from harm. I can't wait to see this strength of character throughout an entire film, as I can only imagine Elizabeth: The Golden Age will see her reign with that power prominently thrust forward.One can't stop with just Blanchett when speaking of the acting on display here. Geoffrey Rush is absolutely brilliant portraying the one man truly working on the Queen's side. It is his role as Sir Francis Walsingham that reminds Elizabeth of who she is. He speaks of what Princes must do to succeed and what dark deeds are necessary for the good of the whole. He treats the Queen as an intelligent being and not a woman in a man's job. Without his dedication and willingness to do the dirty work in order to propel her reputation as one to not take lightly, her reign would have been very short lived. Stoic throughout, besides a few gentle moments where the appearance of a smile can be seen, Rush is the epitome of a man taking his career seriously and the well being of those in his duty to protect ahead of any other.The rest of the cast is a who's who of European greats. Christopher Eccleston is spot-on as the villainous Norfolk just doing what he believes is best for his nation; Joseph Fiennes is good as Lord Robert, however at times seems a bit too theatric; Richard Attenborough brings a nice turn as the Queen's closest adviser, wrestling with his belief in her at the expense of his thoughts that she is just a woman; and then we have the numerous cameos from the likes of Emily Mortimer, Kelly MacDonald, Daniel Craig, James Frain (also starring in the Tudors), and a gem of comedy to lighten the mood from Vincent Cassel. It is these small roles that show the true strength of the film. By reining in the scope of a story about Elizabeth to that crucial time of her ascension to power, it allows for the filmmakers to make sure every detail is perfect. Credit to Hirst and Kapur for getting it all right.",8,1,1,15 October 2007
Ice Age: The Meltdown," Ice Age 2: The Meltdown
","Ice Age came out in 2002 giving me no real inspiration to go check it out. Of course I finally did and found it to be well voiced and scripted. So, when Ice Age 2: The Meltdown debuted, I had a bit more interest in seeing it, even though the idea of sequels usually doesn't hold much clout in my eyes. To my surprise the film kept most of what worked from the original. The performances from Ray Romano, John Leguizamo, and Denis Leary are all humorous and heartfelt. The addition of Queen Latifah as a lifeline for the continuation of mammoth-kind despite thinking she is a possumwas a good touch as she has the voice and attitude that is just right for a family animated film. Her character drives the story along and works well with the returning animals, one of which is the pesky, unable to catch a break, squirrel Scrat. The filmmakers saw that Scrat's mini scenes sprinkled throughout the first film were fan favorites and have brought him back for more. His small vignettes are a perfect parallel to our main plot and payoff with some of the best laughs. They weren't the biggest laughs, however, as those came from the great Will 'Job Bluth' Arnett as our friendly vulture. His sardonic speech is wonderful and his play on theme park/supermarket loud speakers is brilliant comedy.The heart remains from the first as well as the clean animation. However, overall the film doesn't quite match its predecessor as it falls into some lulls and the trap of a bit too much melodrama and sentimentality. Without the duplicity of a character like Diego in the first, the sense of danger is turned down. Whereas he could have turned on them in the herd while they were being chased, having the chase by itself in the sequel can't compete. Also, it would have been nice to have at least mentioned the human child they saved. As Manny says at the end of the original, 'We'll never forget you;' it appears as though they have. In the end though, Ice Age 2 is still well worth a look.",6,0,0,22 July 2006
The Fifth Element," Negative, I am a meat popsicleThe Fifth Element
","After making heavy movies like La Femme Nikita and Leon, it is somewhat of a departure for Luc Besson to do this comic, pulp, sci-fi film The Fifth Element. Looking at his work now, with such high-octane humor as the Transporter series, among others, (written by Besson, but not directed), it doesn't seem that out of place. He just must have decided to only direct his more serious fare and leave the fun stuff to others. However, The Fifth Element is by no means a slight film without a fan base. As far as sci-fi goes, this is a very capable installment. With its mythology, creatures, action, and special effects, the movie has everything going for it. The humor that's infused just makes it better, vaulting it through genres and making it accessible to almost everyone who gives it a try.Like most of its ilk, the story revolves around an evil force about to devour Earth and the rest of life itself as it increases in size and power with each influx of destruction and hate thrown at it. Every opportunity to blow it up only makes it stronger. Through a series of fortunate/ unfortunate happenings, (depending on who you are aligning with), we have the paths crossing of a priest who holds the answers for survival, an ex-military, cab driver bent on having some fun and excitement, a strange woman from another place at the center of it all, an evil mercenary out for money, and the government of the galaxy trying to save face in front of inevitable extermination. It is good versus evil traveling through space in order to either shed light or death out to the universe as victory.In what is a nice little introduction to the myth of the fifth element that will unite with the more common four to wipe out evil, we learn of those who keep the secret of its location. We don't quite know if these aliens are good or not until later, but we do find out the impetus for their coming to the temple on display. A cut forward in time introduces us to the president of the galaxies, (played in what would seem to be horrible casting, but ends up being pretty good with Tommy 'Tiny' Lister, Jr.), and our head priest in the guarding of the truth, Ian Holm. Holm explains what the dark force coming after them is and goes on the quest to find the fifth element and her four stones needed to combat it. This supreme being, played wonderfully by Milla Jovovich with a childlike glee and discovery, falls into the unwitting hands of cabbie Korben DallasBruce Willis at his sarcastic bad-ass best. Willis must join with Holm and Jovovich on a mission to recover the stones and find a way to save the world.A lot of the success lies with the man behind it all, Luc Besson. His script is made up of a pretty solid plot line as far as the world destruction goes. Everything makes sense and is explained in a way to not bore us, but instead in tidbits culled from the numerous characters running about it this singularly unique landscape. The art direction is spectacular and for being a decade old, still has some nice special effects that stand up. I've always been a proponent for prosthetics, when able, at the expense of computer graphics. Reactions are always better from actors who have something real to play off of and the lighting and environments just become more realistic. Even so, when computers are used, the effects are more subtle than flashy and never take away from the story that is being told. No matter what spectacle is on display, the script is what is important.All the personalities on display also lead to much of the greatness that The Fifth Element has to offer. Bruce Willis is the king of this kind of role. His quips and rapport with those around him are priceless. Other standouts are Chris Tucker, in an early role for him, and the great Gary Oldman. Tucker takes loud and obnoxious to a whole new level, but it works flawlessly. His radio DJ has no shame when it comes to working a crowd or chasing the ladies, but his utter fear of danger is hilarious. As for Oldman, I have to believe Besson just said create something fresh. This villain is a pastiche of so many crazy components. His futuristic hair, complete with plastic half shield, is plain weird; the southern accent and buck teeth look is just the right amount of hillbilly; and the disposition of greed and ambivalence is perfect for a bad guy. When he explains how destruction allows all the little machines that man created to finally have work cleaning up the mess, it's fantastic. The real beauty, though, is that no matter how many strong lead roles are here, the little guys steal scenes as well. Singer Tricky is great as Oldman's 'Right Arm' and Mathieu Kassovitz partakes in one of the best scenes in the film when he attempts to mug Willis at his apartment.Even with all its camp and fun, Besson keeps it all grounded in drama as any fantasy tale does. He has a real vision for aesthetics and has changed his scope often as he goes from film to film. From the mobster/corrupt cop world of New York, to the countryside of war with Joan of Arc, he never pigeonholes himself in a style. I am still holding out hope that his newest, Angel-A, with all its black and white, stylish noir feel, will hit the big screens here in Buffalo. It will be a real shame if the rumors are true and the completion of his children tale, Arthur and the Minimoys, will be the final work by him as a director.",8,94,124,2 August 2007
"I Love You, Man"," You sound like a leprechaun  I Love You, Man
","Hollywood comedy these days is just one giant extended family tree. Everyoneand I mean everyonehas a connection and brings their friends along wherever they go. The new film I Love You, Man is no exception. This is a very good thing, because if I were to go on writer Larry Levin's previous work, (scripting the Dr. Dolittle remake saga), I would have stayed far, far away. But instead I saw the Apatow flair with Jason Segel and regular Paul Rudd mixed with a little NBC love, ('The Office's' Rashida Jones, 'Earl's' Jaime Pressly, and 'SNL's' Andy Sambergwho does steal his scenes with facial expressions aloneand Jane Curtain), and just a who's who of supporting roles. Even director John Hamburg has done work with both Apatow and 'The State' gang, much like Rudd. How could it fail right? While it does ends up on par with lesser Judd, see Knocked Up, it is a lot of fun for the duration. Possibly delving too much in the sentimental/heart category, it definitely wears its contributors' multiple styles on its sleeve. And that's a very good thing.Okay, so here I am listening to The Duke Spirit and trying to think about what to say about the movie. I want to give some info on the plot, but singular moments of hilarity keep cropping up, pushing the story to the background. Really, though, a film like this does kind of use its script as a roadmap for gags. The story is obvious: guy asks girl to marry him, realizes he has no guy friends, goes on a journey looking for a best man, finds his plutonic soulmate as a result, and watches his world fall apart when finally living his life. Will it all work out? You'll have to watch to find out, unless of course you have gone to the movies at least once in the past decade  then I'm sure you can make a pretty educated guess. Instead of wasting time elaborating on the plot that you know completely if you've seen the trailer, I'll talk about the laughs and the actors causing them, (yes, a couple times the laughter drowned out the next line, but thankfully filmmakers these days realize this and usually follow the big jokes with filler space or unnecessary dialogue).You know it's all about having a good time when guys like Broken Lizard's Jay Chandraskhar or David Krumholtz appear for five seconds of face time. Heck, even Lou Ferrigno joins the crew for a fun role as himself. And what's this? He also was in an episode of 'Reno 911!'? The connections to these comedy cliques are staggering. Speaking of which, Thomas Lennon is great here as well. Sure the trailer gives away a lot of his role, but don't be disappointed, he returns later on with a priceless moment. It's not all about the glee at seeing familiar faces, though; the supporting cast really is utilized well and to the actors' strengths. J.K. Simmons will be the consummate father figure forever now after Juno, Curtain is somewhat wasted but enjoyable, and Samberg is even funnier when you get the full story on his character, that which the preview edits out to just being his father's best friend, along with Hank of course. Even Jon Favreau is classic as the prick husband to the bride Jones' best friend Denise. The guy's deadpan ambivalence and selfishness, complete with toothpick, really shine.The reason his attitude works so well is that it plays off of Paul Rudd's effeminate hero Pistol Pete. This isn't the jerk he portrayed in Role Models; Rudd is the classic 'nice guy' here. His love for Chocolat, gossiping with the girls at work, and penchant for getting hit on by gay men become the stereotypes that his character needs to break free of during his evolution. He tries so desperately hard to be cool that he slangs every word out of his mouth while in front of prospective 'bros', coming out as gibberish. Watching Segel's reactions to the verbal diarrhea spewing from Rudd makes you wonder if those moments were ad-libbed. If not, credit Segel's acting prowess, because each smile and laugh looked 100% genuine. With Jason's Sydney, you really do get a mirror image of Peter, just the confident version. The two have so much in common, (love the Rush moments, including the band's own cameo), that they also need each other to become more well-rounded. While Rudd needs to let loose and be a man sometimes, Segel needs to take notes as well, as far as growing up and realizing life comes with consequences.And once again, like most of these guys' comedies have been since The 40-Year Old Virgin, it is so self-referential to the industry. These characters have favorite bands and movies and actors. They impersonate 'The Hulk' and James Bond; they watch HBO and visit Legoland with the kids. In other words, these people are like us only placed on screen. I think that is what works so well for these films, the audience they are marketed towards can relate completely with what is going on. Yes the stakes are a bit heightened: puke becomes a plot point and the use of urinal cakes as a marketing tool is explained, but underneath it all is your life experiences  only played by pretty people. There is a lot to enjoy with I Love You, Man and if nothing else it just keeps the laughs going until Funny People arrives. But maybe that's rude of me to say. It's not like all these films are just warm-ups to Apatow's creations, they exist on their own with success. As long as they all continue to work together and migrate into each other's films, we the viewers can only rejoice at our good fortune.",7,2,5,10 March 2009
Superbad," Yeah, I learned about that in health classSuperbad
","The title says it all. This movie is superbadass. You know, in as far as movie standards go, Superbad is not a masterpiece, or even something to speak about with more than a chuckle. With that said, though, I had a great time with this flick. It is tough to be a hard-R without any nudity for a film of its kind these days. The shear abundance of cursing and innuendo make you feel dirty enough. How writers Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg came up with some of the situations shown, or the ridiculousness of what these characters say, is beyond me, but the genuine way in which it is all delivered is true to the spirit of that time on the cusp between high school and college. These kids are the dorks always being pushed to the background and they have one opportunity to turn that all around. The journey they take to finally get there, though, is a ride you won't believe.A lot is being said about this being a Judd Apatow film. A few of his regulars are on hand, Rogen, Jonah Hill, and Martin Starr; it has a more intellectual way of getting the laughs that usually come off as being funny with no transition to the story in lesser fare; and above all else, it is a story from the heart about the bond of friendship. The movie is not, however, directed by Apatow; instead, the man is Greg Mottola. Now I am not slighting him in the faintest here, but I don't think it would have mattered who directed it. There aren't any huge set pieces or inventive camera tricks. As far as these types of films go, it is the writing that supersedes all. The thing about 40 Year Old Virgin and Knocked Up is not that they were directed by Apatow, but that they were written by him. When it comes to Superbad, the script is just too funny to be able to be harmed by the man behind the camera. As long as he keeps the film rolling on these actors, the writing will carry it to the promise land. I give all the credit to Rogen and Goldberg for that, and hope their second feature, Pineapple Express, will be as goodI mean these two started writing both films in high schoolthat's impressive.If anything needs mentioning besides the screenplay, it is the wonderful acting. All the awkwardness of high school and sex come across with truth and candor. Michael Cera's delivery is just insane. His looks of innocence and ability to let the words come out as if they are of the moment and genuine reactions sell it every time. The chemistry with his character's best friend, played by Hill, comes across well and the two have a witty rapport. All the scenes you saw in the trailer were alternate versions, the real footage is much funnier and much dirtier; these two definitely enjoy playing off one another. Through the reality of all the anxiety of going to the one graduation party they have been invited to and the responsibility bestowed upon them to bring the alcohol, we are given some situations along the way that are more or less unreal. From the leg used as a tampon scene; the getting hit by a car, not once, but twice; the singing of 'These Eyes' with a bunch of cokeheads; the nice cameos from David Krumholtz and Kevin Corrigan at a messed up party; or anything that happens with the town's wonderful law enforcement, the laughs never stop. Unfortunately, it does feel long and drawn out overall, I can't remember a lull in the story, but the pacing just dragged a bit. By having it fire on all cylinders yet still feel a bit sluggish, I must put blame on the inexperienced Mottola. Maybe pointing the camera isn't all that needs to be done to make a great script pop.What stands out above all else, though, is the debut of Christopher Mintz-Plasse. The kid is total geekfrom nerdy glasses, boyish haircut, ghetto speak, and nasal voice, McLovin is total cool. He handles the role splendidly as he is trucked around town by the best cops ever, played by Rogen and Bill Hader. These three are priceless throughout their travels, right down to the wonderful finale of their story arc. Mintz-Plasse shows how even the dork can make it happen with a little confidence and a couple beers down the hatch. Hey, he did out Breathalyzer Rogen in the squad car. There was no stopping the laughs when these guys were in front of the camera, but then there were few breaks otherwise as well. While not as intelligent or lasting as Virgin, it was a better and raunchier time then the overly sappy and romantic Knocked Up. This film is not for your teenage kids, though, it is for you people in your twenties and thirties looking to remember back in the day when you were as awkward and helpless as these sad souls. All you can do is hope that when you look back at your past, you took the plunge and made a name for yourself as these kids did.",8,0,6,23 August 2007
Hot Fuzz," Decaffeinated?Hot Fuzz
","Simon Pegg and Edgar Wright are back, with a vengeance. Their send up to all those action filmsas they say containing names picked at random from two hats, one of verbs, the other of adjectivesis a fantastic melding of British humor, preposterous action sequences, gruesome horror, and a bit of romantic comedy thrown in for good measure. But then, what action flick doesn't have a little bit of romantic chemistry between its two macho lead actors? As with Shaun of the Dead, Hot Fuzz is not a spoof playing on the weaknesses of movies, deriding them as a result, but instead a send up to the films that they themselves love and adore. By playing on the clichés and lack of realism inherent in those types of movies, Pegg and Wright, in effect, create their own addition to the genre, knowing full well what they are doing because they know action films as fans and want to do them justice while also pointing out their absurdities.Not quite sure how this comedy powerhouse would hold up to their first masterpiece, I knew all was well once I saw staples Julia Deakin and Bill Bailey involved in the mayhem. Anytime the old 'Spaced' crew can come out to play, I'm ready to enjoy. The premise of the film is as ludicrous as most popcorn action movies, seeing London's top policeman, I mean officer, being reassigned to the country for doing his job too well and making the station look bad. Upon going to the reigning safest city in England, he sees the bumbling team he is to work with and the small town values subverting him from doing his job. Underage drinking? It's OK because we are keeping them off the streets, anything for the greater good of course. Only when our hero starts to see what the town calls accidents are really murders, does he begin to delve deeper into the motives of the town's elders to see what is going on behind the scenes.Credit Pegg and Wright for taking the time for some great exposition before we get to the all out gunfight of its conclusion. Viewers should be warned that this is a British comedy at heart, setting up the story intelligently and coherently so that the finale is that much more effective. Again, this is not a spoof of loosely tied together sequences just out for cheap laughs; it is a well-told, complete story that stands on its own without the need to catch every pop-culture reference included. That said though, the comedy is huge when it comes to the subtle hinting at appropriated images from past films. Pegg and Wright have shown with their show 'Spaced' that they are the kings at pop-culture comedy, think 'Family Guy' only less absurd in their integration to the story. Sure there are the blatant examples like Nick Frost pumping a clip of bullets into the air (Point Break) and the helicopter flying in slow motion above their heads (Bad Boys 2), and all the one liners culled from decades of actioners, however, there are also lesser known in-jokes like the fence scene mimicking their own Shaun of the Dead, and references to the Addams Family and He-Man among others. Even the Godzilla like fight in a model village, while already done in 'Arrested Development,' is orchestrated to perfection.Hot Fuzz is really all about the actors delivering the gem of a screenplay. The real action flicks are known for their special effects and explosions, but this film does not have the budget for all that. Instead we are treated with many close-up shots during big fight scenes in order to give the look of high-octane action yet keeping within financial constraints. It's the facial expressions of the cast that sell the scenes for realism purposes as well as for big laughs. Our lead is perfectly played by Simon Pegg himself. His dry sense of sarcasm and utter professionalism amongst the idiots of the nation make him the only person to save the town from destruction. As always, his sidekick is portrayed by, real-life best friend, Nick Frost. Frost's ability to be a child is superb and goes well with the relationship of student/ teacher evolving into one of equals. His asinine questions and giddy clapping and laughing are hilarious, but when the time comes to take care of business, he's ready for the big show. The supporting cast are all fantastic as well with their broad characters allowed to run wild, while honed in enough to suit the story. Timothy Dalton has some big laugh moments as the villainous supermarket owner, Jim Broadbent is having a blast as the easy going chief inspector, and Paddy Considine and Rafe Spall give us some of the funniest lines and reactions as the Andys.In the end, the story really proves to be a lot more intelligent than you might expect. Pegg and Wright not only had to come up with a setup to their big blast of gunfire, but in fact came up with two explanations in order for their reveal to be effective. When our villains laugh and say their motives were so much easier than thought, it's great.I'm sure many people will end up finding the film to be slow and unfunny, and that is all because of expectations we Americans have. We want our comedies to be broad and in your face, however, British humor is not as cut and dry as that. Hopefully the audiences here will give the film a chance for the great movie it is, or at least sit through it for the awesome payoff at the end. Elderly folk in an all out war with the police, having an unlimited amount of ammo? Only in England.",9,3,5,21 April 2007
Orphan," Look at the snow orphan—snorphan?  Orphan
","Surprise, surprise, Orphan actually isn't that bad. Who would have thought something that appeared to be a bad rehash of The Omen could truly entertain? I guess the ability to acquire the services of a couple on the cusp of A-list status actors in Peter Sarsgaard and Vera Farmiga should have raised an eyebrow, but honestly I still had many reservations. In fact, I knew the 'twist' before sitting down in the theatre—something that I believe enhanced my enjoyment rather than lessened it. Perhaps this knowledge made the proceedings appear more comical than they should have been and maybe took away from some of the horror aspects, however, it also invested me in the tale to see how the revelation would be discovered. The acting is impressive across the board and the visuals are enjoyable for the most part. I loved the opening sequence bridging reality and dream, as well as the utilization of black light, (hokily alluded to with the opening WB icon), but the fake scares—and there are many—started to anger me a bit.This is not the type of horror I enjoy normally; I tend to gravitate more towards the fantastical or supernatural. That said, though, I understand the gimmicks used and the techniques relied upon. Director Jaume Collet-Serra appeared to want to subvert some preconceptions by giving us multiple instances of slow tracking shots towards a blind spot with music swelling louder and louder only to reveal  nothing. I see what he was attempting—trying to get the audience off guard—but all it ended up doing was making me numb to the moments that actually delivered. Rather than be affected from the 'jump scares' I was more entertained by the brutal violence utilized. Not many films of this ilk are R-rated these days, so when you do get one, it is somewhat a breath of fresh air. There are some definite pedophilic elements at play, very strong language, (used often to comical effect), and the desire to make what few deaths there are as memorable as possible. I mean, come on, if you have a hammer and a body prone and ready for a whack, why not make sure the deed gets done by smashing away a few extra times? I really bought into the beginning due to the fantastic work on the part of Farmiga. The devastation wrought on her face after a stillbirth is unavoidable. Here is a mother of two that had so much love for her unborn child, she crawled into a shell of depression at the loss, needing an outlet for the pain and bottled up emotions never able to be showered on the child. Her detachment from the family, especially her husband, is evident, as is the pure joy at finding young Esther in the orphanage, thinking that her love could finally be released. Farmiga embodies the role so completely that, if I remember correctly, she instinctively signs 'thank you', (her daughter is deaf), when leaving the orphanage. The moment has no need for it as her hearing impaired child is at home, but it is definitely something that character would do unconsciously. She is also very good opposite Sarsgaard and his inability to stand by her when the truth about Esther begins to show through. At times it seems he is phoning the performance in, but ultimately he does a good job; maybe he is just overshadowed by his counterpart.Rounding out the acting are two brilliant turns from the youngsters. Aryana Engineer plays Max with professionalism and realism. Deaf in real life, she is amazingly able to portray the fear and anxiety that comes with knowing what her new sister is capable of. Unable to tell anyone, both due to her handicap and the threats on her and the family's lives, she must lie and say everything is okay. But her subtle cowering in fright at the sight of Esther in her door is quite palpable. Speaking of Esther, you can't deny the performance of twelve-year-old Isabelle Fuhrman. The most recent example of what parents are willing to allow their children to do for money, (Sacha Baron Cohen's Brüno would be proud), she is effectively creepy and dangerous in her lack of a moral compass and instinctual need to survive. More robotic and calculated at the start, it is the final act, where her true identity is revealed, that shines. The malice and rage buried beneath an angelic façade is finally out in the open; a master manipulator and seductress, Fuhrman will turn some heads and hopefully have a career before her without being typecast in the genre.Orphan begs to memory the slasher flicks of the 90s like Child's Play rather than the psychological terrors I relate to more. I won't let that deter me from recommending the film to those out for some blood because the talent involved cannot be denied. The script can be very generic at times, yet glimmers of surprise come through every once in awhile. With a 'twist' that may not be too well hidden, the carnage doesn't stay only with disposable roles like one would expect in a movie such as this. I'll just say that the stars aren't safe from knife work, nor a glimpse at their mortality. In the end, though, it is still nothing more than a good night out for some bloody fun. But, then, when did that become a bad thing?",6,2,3,8 August 2009
Terminator Salvation," So that's what death tastes like  Terminator Salvation
","You do not need to be aware of the television show 'The Sarah Connor Chronicles' at all, and frankly don't need to know too much about the original trilogy either. Salvation amps up the action, brings in some pretty good talent to perform, and gets the aesthetic of post-Judgment Day perfect. Unfortunately, for all that it succeeds to accomplish, there is one glaring problem—the story is very thin. With action scenes and explosions filling the screen at a rapid pace, story is pushed to the back, making the film very much an opening to a larger tale. When put alongside the future installments, (there is no way this tanks to the point the money isn't there for more), it may all work perfectly. Watching as a film on its own just shows a fantastic surface with a weak interior heart.I use the simile with the heart because of how important that muscle is for character Marcus Wright. The film opens with his lethal injection in 2003, allowing us to see him sign away his body to a very creepy, cancer-ridden Helena Bonham Carter. The blatant, ham-fisted script pushes its agenda of second chances right from the start and never stops. Nor does it let up on the fact that Marcus' heart is very strong, a pulsing that comforts Moon Bloodgood's Blair Williams as she rests her head against his chest in 2018. Wait  2018? I thought he died in prison fifteen years earlier? Well, what would a Terminator movie be without a Terminator? Salvation uses the character of Marcus Wright much to the same effect that 'Battlestar Galactica' used the skin-job cylons: a combination of machine and biology, one who's consciousness stills holds the humanity necessary to make choices in his actions. Because, of course, the true sign of what sets a human apart from machine is its heart.Besides Wright's awakening, the film concerns the evolution of John Connor and his place in the Resistance. A rogue voice commanding the masses, as people listen to him because of the rumors and speculation they have heard, Connor is not a general, nor is he universally loved. Many believe him to be a false prophet, not worth the time or effort, despite the eventual discovery of things that he had spoken of years before. One major plus in Salvation, though, is that his teacher and mother Sarah Connor didn't know everything; the future seems to have changed. A creature such as Marcus was never fathomed before. The fact that time travel has been occurring for the past three decades in attempts to eradicate John and to save him means that the timeline has been altered. Somewhere along the line the machines discovered their failures and advanced their AI to create the ultimate infiltrator—half man/half machine. However, this weapon is awakened before ready, an outcome caused by Connor's arrival on a mission to the Skynet laboratory, a mission that ends with the destruction of everything in sight, besides Connor and Wright, therefore setting them on a collision course.Wright goes on a journey to find the one person that might be able to explain why he is alive, Bonham Carter's Dr. Serena Kogan. On his way he meets the LA division of the Resistance in Anton Yelchin's Kyle Reese. Yelchin is great in the role, even making facial expressions that recall memories of Michael Biehn in the original film. With this and Star Trek, the kid is finally making it into the big time after a very successful early career. John Connor is also on the lookout for Reese, searching while hatching a plan to utilize a sound frequency that will shutdown the machines. Once Reese is captured, both Wright and Connor try to find a way to recover him.As exposition, Terminator Salvation is a success. It refreshes our memories on the relationship between characters, re-familiarizing viewers with the age gaps and ramifications time travel has done to them through the previous stories. There is a nice progression for Marcus Wright as we see him for what he was and who he becomes. Sam Worthington, a virtual unknown on this side of the Atlantic, but soon to hit it big after filming the lead in James Cameron's new Avatar, sinks his teeth into the role. Here is a Terminator that has a heart, has emotions and feelings, and has the ability to go against programming, even if he doesn't know he was programmed to begin with. It is something seeing a soul behind the eyes of a face half composed of metal. Wright's story is where the plot's strengths end, though. We are introduced to Bryce Dallas Howard as Connor's wife and to Common and Bloodgood as two of his soldiers, but we really know nothing about them. Even Christian Bale's John Connor falls a bit flat.Don't get me wrong, Bale plays the part to perfection, (I could have done with less growl), and the character lives up to the one we've seen before. There just isn't anything here to make us grow an attachment to him, to allow for the ending to resonate as much as the filmmakers would hope. Worthington's Wright is so complete a character, and even Yelchin's Reese is completely three-dimensional, that Connor is left by the wayside. Bale is asked to perform as someone more legend than man, someone making the tough decisions in order to save the world. I just wish the story allowed us to discover who he is and what he is to become; I guess maybe we'll get that in the next film. So, for now, just be happy to see a glorious landscape of charred, bleak destruction, inhabited by robotic vehicles of death wreaking havoc wherever they go. As an action flick it is great, but besides Marcus Wright's conflicted monster, there isn't much more than that. Truthfully, though, does there really need to be?",7,19,39,19 May 2009
500 Days of Summer," I think you know what I need  (500) Days of Summer
","This is a story of boy meets girl and it most definitely is not a love story  in the strictest sense of the word at least. Love is a major factor in (500) Days of Summer; just not in the way you may anticipate, thinking the film a romantic comedy. Instead, the tale shows us how love, or the lack therefore, can effect two young souls, lost and alone in the world. When Tom meets Summer his life is turned around to sunshine and rainbows—a full dance number, complete with Disney-fied bluebird, expresses this fact. What he doesn't know that first day is that when she tells him she isn't looking for anything serious, she means it. Tom's journey to salvation or damnation is one through the rough and tumble world of love and he is its punching bag. But one must realize that all things happen for a reason, we all need to find that love-struck puppy to show us it exists as more than a dream and we all need to find that cynical non-believer to help build up the skin and realize life isn't perfect.Tom's younger sister Rachel, played wonderfully by Chloe Moretz, is the voice of reason on all things relationship. She says the one thing that all people involved in a breakup need to hear. It wasn't always good; you can't remember the one that got away in love-rimmed glasses. You need to look again and see the bad, see the ways in which he or she let you down and realize that it wasn't meant to be. Maybe they left because what you felt wasn't in their heart and, truthfully, that is a good thing. You don't want to be in a relationship built on lies; sometimes you just aren't meant to be together. So many lines in this film resonate as nuggets of wisdom so true, yet ignored when it is you those words are trying to hit. Tom asks Summer what went wrong with all her previous boyfriends and she responds with, 'What always happens? Life'. It isn't always written in stone, nor is anything permanent. Each one of us needs to work as hard as he can to keep a relationship alive because love is not always enough. But when you find that person you are meant to be with, 'you'll just know'. You'll see that thing that you could not find in the ones before.That's enough of the pain for now, though. Despite this being a story about heartbreak and the love that caused it and that which heals it, there are a lot of laughs to go with the serious drama. What makes that drama hit so hard is not only the fact that the emotions are all laid out raw and unfiltered, but also because of the levity used to temper it all. The tone is set very early as the film begins with a disclaimer cautioning that any resemblances to real life are merely coincidental  even for the girl on whom Summer is based. This little touch, showing the audience how personal the tale is to the writers adds one more layer to its everyman disposition. We are experiencing something we have all seen in real life, whether to us or someone close—the pain of rejection, the confusion of utopia's demise. The humor is offbeat throughout and adds just the right amount of indie flair to make it endearing. How else could a full dance number work in the middle of a non-linear narrative about a breakup so devastating our lead spends almost half his 500 days without the girl, just reminiscing on what they had—or what he thought they had? And don't forget Geoffrey Arend's physical comedy, stealing scenes and standing out just as he did in Supertroopers and Garden State.However, it is watching Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Zooey Deschanel interact as Tom and Summer that is amazing. The chemistry is there, something Gordon-Levitt said was easy due to the fact he listened to her album with M.Ward—making up the duo She and Him—each morning. Having been love interests in the fantastic film Manic, although under very different circumstances in that heavy drama, surely helped too. Their rapport is honest and relatable; watching them have fun in Ikea, making it their own personal playhouse, is great. Comedic timing precise and possibly ad-libbed, lines like 'honey, don't look now but a Chinese family is in our bathroom' land direct hits. But those moments aren't only utilized for laughs; they also show the symmetry of life by using the line as an example of bliss for day 38, but also of distance and disinterest come day 191. Life definitely happens to this couple, making them stronger even if a year of pain and weakness is necessary to acquire that strength.Told out of order, we experience the 500 days of the title just as the writers want us to. Days are coupled to mirror each other for greater emotive force, they are shown in sequence quickly as a humorous device expressing days spent in bed depressed, and they are paired to prove how fickle dating is as one day Tom is in love and the next they are through, even though they never were a they to that point. Kudos to director Marc Webb for going all out: getting stellar performances from his cast and infusing unique style, a rockin' soundtrack, and even moments of animated sketches. Rarely can you put life in all its glorious blemishes and bruises on screen without the need to tack on a happy ending or contrived moment of explanation, sometimes there aren't any. But this is a story about a boy and girl who went through adolescence listening to sad, melancholy Brit-pop. We're lucky these kids aren't Goths as a result, just two souls looking for answers, unsure if the other can supply them.",9,2,4,8 July 2009
Juno," TIFF07, review: It all started with a chairJuno
","It's a good feeling when you can walk out of your very first Toronto Film Festival showing thinking, 'Wow, that was great.' The screening was for Juno, the sophomore effort from director Jason Reitman. Let's just say that the proverbial slump is nowhere to be seen. I enjoyed Thank You For Smoking immensely, however, the ending couldn't hold the tone he had set up from the start. With Juno, I kept waiting for the same pitfall, but thankfully it never showed face. As Reitman said in the post-show Q&A, when reading debut writer Diablo Cody's work, he too was anticipating the train to derail and couldn't believe it stayed solid through to the end. For a script that took her only two months to write, after a producer happening across her blog emailed her his compliments, she hit this one out of the park.The story is about a girl who just finds out she is pregnant by her best friend Paul Bleeker, played by the wonderful Ellen Page and Michael Cera respectively. Trying to come to grips with the situation, and dealing with issues 'way beyond her maturity level,' Page decides to give the child up to a family that will love him or her. On the journey that follows, some quirky relationships manifest between Juno and her baby's father, her own father and stepmother, and the family she is giving the baby to. Throughout it all is a strong display of comedy gold. As the screenwriter Cody said, while she was never pregnant, the relationships are surely autobiographical. She experienced life as a sixteen-year-old, and by adding the dynamic of childrearing, was able to hypothesize the antics that could ensue.While the subject matter is serious stuff, Reitman allows the screenplay to circumvent the weight with a big dose of levity. If nothing else, you will leave the film remembering some top-notch one-liners as Cody has a knack for sarcasm and witty retorts. The abundance of laughs helps get us through the heavier moments and never shortchanges or patronizes the situation at hand. All the credit here goes to Page for a powerhouse performance. She is coming into her own as a woman to look for in Hollywood. Her attitude is infectious while being slightly rude as far as social standards go. The character is fully believable as one who understands what is happening yet tries to play it off by disguising it with humor.That humor succeeds even more by support from the rest of the stellar cast. J.K. Simmons and Allison Janney have spot-on timing with their cynical yet loving affections for their daughter Juno. Everything Simmons says is classic and when Janney gets room to roam free; she delivers some of the biggest laughs. Michael Cera is hysterical as always with his innocent looks of naïveté and natural screen persona. Reitman did admit that he ad-libbed a few lines, and to enhance a script like this one at his age by going with the flow shows the talent he possesses. I just hope he breaks out of the mold a little bit more and soon, as he has played the same role in the last three enterprises I have seen him in. And, what better way to begin the film than with a spot-on cameo from an uncredited Rainn Wilson that brings the laughter strong straight away.As far as the heart to the story, it really is the relationship between Juno and the couple she is letting adopt her child played by Jason Bateman and Jennifer Garner. Their interactions are the core of the film. Each experience sets a new learning curve for the young girl and it is the evolution between the three that creates the film's payoff. Garner may be a tad overbearing in her presentation, however, if she toned it down, it might not have been as effective.Overall, this is the kind of small film that proves how good art can bring great people together. The rapport between Reitman, Page, and Cody post-viewing was very light and cheery as though they were longtime friends. It appears everyone involved had a blast and believed in the message they set out to show. Never moralizing or shoving an agenda down our throats, this comedy is here to entertain. The laughs are big to the point where you may miss the next line, but that's OK as its one I'd revisit anytime.Tidbits from the filmmakers:  On being willing to receive input from Cody during production, Reitman says, 'I've never been a sixteen-year-old girlalthough I tried.'  On the producers being American, Reitman says, 'Oh, no, this is Canadian, it was shot here.' Ellen Page replies, 'We'll just use their money.'  Props to Diablo Cody for not letting early fame get to her head and sporting a Superman t- shirt to the screening.",9,7,16,11 September 2007
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," Oooo, a peanutPirates of the Caribbean: At World's End
","Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End is the final part of a very cohesive trilogy. There are no recaps between the films; they consist of a single story that is to be followed part by part. You must watch the first movie to be introduced to our heroes and supporting players because it is their actions here that make them the people they are later on. I would recommend seeing at least the second installment again before viewing the finale, however, it is not necessary as being a fan I was able to compose myself very early on with where we had left off. Credit to the filmmakers for realizing that this was the second half of the long tale that makes up parts two and three and not a standalone entity. The fanbase is intact and if you didn't like the previous, why should they cater to your needs of refreshing when the film isn't made for you? With all that said, I believe this film to be on steady ground with the two it follows, rounding out what is a very successful trilogya tough thing to come by lately.We enter the film with a prologue showing the singular will of the pirate community, something that is strong and will come into play later on. The sequence is effective in giving the audience a chance to rejoin the dirt and atmosphere that these movies have so effectively portrayed. Our main action soon follows as our heroes continue their quest for Jack Sparrow and his Black Pearl. Some need the ship to free the bonds of servitude for loved ones, some need Jack to assuage their conscience, while others just want the ship back in order to fulfill a promise that brought them back from the dead. Each character's motives are held tightly to their chests and we are privy to numerous changes of allegiance and multiple double crossing, although not always crossing the ones we think. Alliances are struck and pirates join together in order to save their kind from the East India Company's tyranny and Davy Jones' renegade, murderous bent created from his sacrificing the one being that ever loved him. Don't worry, though, if you have been having fun and following along, all the twists and turns make perfect sense. Also, the intricacies of the plot really impressed me because whether or not originally planned as a trilogy, the attention to detail and past occurrences truly allow one to become totally wrapped up in the action.Once again the acting is top-notch. True it is oftentimes over-the-top, but that is what is expected here. This is a fantastical adventure story seeped in mythology, history, and romance. Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley have evolved into very serious people who have seen much pain and death. There is little humor with them as in previous installments, however, their love for each other still exists and whether they trust the other or not, they do what they have to do to keep that bond alive. Johnny Depp is again in top form and just adds to the Jack Sparrow role. The laughs still exist, but we also get to see a side of Jack that has been missing, a true drive to fight and a willingness to sacrifice himself for the victory.These three do see a bit of a push to the background as we are bombarded with characters from all sides, though. Barbossa is back, and this is a great thing. Geoffrey Rush was one of the best pieces that the original film had going for it, and to have him and Depp together again, this time on the same side, is a treat indeed. Naomie Harris returns with effectiveness and the ability to still look gorgeous even under her gypsy woman garb; Bill Nighy proves once more that no matter how much cgi is used, it is his skill as a performer that truly overcomes; Tom Hollander portrays his villain with the same amount of sleaze mixed with a false arrogance that he is covering all his bases as in the second, when in reality he is working with pirates, they swear allegiance to no one; and Chow Yun-Fat adds a nice air of professionalism in an intimidating role whose motives are never really known.Besides the writing being true to the franchise and the acting never missing a step, the real success again lies in the animation and visuals. Director Gore Verbinski has a superb eye and a creative streak shown at numerous moments. The visual effects are once more the best in the business and some sequences, such as Hollander's descent amidst an imploding ship or the final ship battle inside a giant maelstrom, are truly breathtaking to experience and wonder how long it could have taken to orchestrate to perfection. Some moments crossed the line a bit, like every time Depp's psyche brought out multiple versions of himself, whether in Davy Jones' locker or out. These instances showed some nice effect in superimposing many Jack Sparrows interacting with each other, but they were overly long and ultimately totally unnecessary to the story at hand.After it all, I can't think of a better way for this franchise to finish. There was no degradation in my opinion throughout the series and with a fully fleshed beginning and end, I hope that this will be all we see. Verbinski needs to continue on to other things, bringing his singular vision with him to create new and innovative films. As for the characters, I believe they have finished strong and whole, any more entries will only demean the integrity that has held thus far. Don't be surprised too if people die that you do not expect, Pirates does not cop out, and as a result succeeds that much more.",8,1,3,31 May 2007
Spider-Man 3," I'd give my life for themSpider-Man 3
","So here it is, the final piece to the Raimi/Maguire trilogy of superheroes and love conquering all. The first two installments in the franchise helped rejuvenate the comic book movie, making them be taken seriously and showing that a little imagination surrounded by the real world could create suspense, action, and heart. Spider-Man 3 had a lot of expectations to live up to, and not just to be cohesive and complete with three villains and a couple new faces on the side. I know I myself went into the film to see whether Sam Raimi and company could round the story out and keep true to what had come before. By the end, while not completely satisfied and somewhat letdown at times, I found that I could still come out with a smile. The arcs of our principal characters come to a close and the presentation is a sight to behold. Unfortunately, with all the spectacle, money, and talent going into it, I just wished it would have stayed truer in tone and brought a little more to the table.First off, the acting is fantastic as usual; if nothing else, the trio of films showed that comic book films didn't need to be campy. Tobey Maguire proves again why he was, and is, the only choice to play the titular role. If Sony backs up their statements that a fourth go is in store with or without him, I may join the masses in boycotting it and taking a stand for artistic credibility rather than financial gain. Even when Maguire needed to ham it up (more on this later), he is the perfect mixture of geek and cool to pull it off perfectly. Kirsten Dunst does well again, showing some emotion in what is more simply a damsel-in-distress role than the previous films and James Franco is good also. Franco needs to show some huge range going from villain to amnesiac happy-go-lucky kid, and while he goes a tad overboard on the giddiness, the part works. As for the newcomers, Raimi shows once again that he has some clout and Hollywood cred, assembling one of the biggest casts with people doing very little. Bryce Dallas Howard is little more than a pawn at the expense of the plot and James Cromwell is a blink and you'll miss him blip on the screen. Even our new villains are given much less screen time than anticipated, however, they step it up and really steal the show.Thomas Haden Church truly inhabits the inner conflicted soul of Sandman. Everything he does is for love and while he may not want to do some things, he has no problem doing them if it may bring him closer to his daughter. Church gives a layered and nuanced performance, never falling into the one-dimensional villain trap a character like this usually does. As for the long awaited arrival of Venom, Topher Grace shows why he deserves the big budget roles to go along with his more accomplished indie porfolio. The malice and manic hysteria that comes out of him is both fun and frightening and he becomes an enjoyable foe to our hero. Along with the superb acting, we are given some spectacular visual effects. While some set pieces and background animation at many times looks cartoony and unpolished, you cannot fault the sandwork or the alien symbiote creature. The amount of detail taken on these two villains definitely shows where the enormous budget went, and it is good to see it was used to great effect.Where the film ultimately falls apart, in my opinion, is with the story itself. This is the first of the trilogy not to have a comic book mythology veteran behind the script. With most coming from Raimi himself and his brother, it shows a bit of a lack of stakes that the previous two had. Instead we are given a complete tonal change and a ton of slapstick and comedic moments. Some sequences, like that of Maguire dancing through the streets, confidence oozing from him due to the symbiote, really slow the film down to a crawl. The movie tries at too many times to be cute and while this might work to offset the dark and suspenseful moments in other films, Spider-Man 3 doesn't really have many rough spots to counteract. Sure the fight scenes are spectacular, but they just lack the sense of urgency from the past installments, always keeping the viewer removed from what is happening, just waiting for the heroes to be victorious. What started as a dark tale of heroism and the battle of one's own demons, with the first two chapters, concludes in a very heavy-handed and sentimental way.By no means am I not recommending this film thoughI enjoyed it throughout and only in a few instances did I feel its length. It is just that with the second part upping the ante like it did from its already great predecessor, I was disappointed that this final chapter ended up being the least successful of the three. Maybe it was because so much was happening and it all had to be resolved in one film, maybe it was that this is possibly the last Spider-Man from Raimi and he needed to end it all on his terms, I don't know. What I do know, though, is that the writing is not as intelligent as it was and sappiness, along with unintentional laughs, sometimes made me cringe. However, when the fighting started and emotions ran high, you can't not be caught up in it allat least until the dust settles.",6,2,5,4 May 2007
Resident Evil: Extinction," Project Alice is onlineResident Evil Trilogy
","Paul WS Anderson has given us the newest trilogy of diminishing returns. I have never played the video game before and therefore went into the 2002 original Resident Evil containing little knowledge of the mythology. With that novice mentality, I found myself really enjoying the film. It gave me the background needed, the action and suspense expected, and a cliffhanger leaving me anticipating more. That continuation came but two years later with the subtitle Apocalypse. Here was a film that showed how the series' origin story was a huge part to the main plot of the first. This entry featured a bare-bones story, namely the extraction of a scientist's child from the infected Raccoon City, yet that was okay. The action was amped up, the characters more accessible, the acting vastly superior, and the ingenuity evolved. While lacking in plot, it excelled in action and effects, making it an equal, in my mind, to its predecessor. Its final twenty minutes was even devoted entirely to setting up the third piece to the puzzle. Here, though, is where the train derails hard. Extinction had a fantastic setup, yet instead of continuing right where we left off, we meet a caravan of survivors seeking gas and motoring cross-country. Nothing is progressed story-wise that we already did not know. Where the sparse plot didn't matter in the second, it stuck out like a sore thumb with the latest installment.It is Milla Jovovich's total blank slate in the first film, which makes it so endearing. We learn what the Umbrella Corporation is all about as she slowly remembers her role with them. It was a successful zombie movie, utilizing the jump scares and the hyperkinetic pace needed to keep you on the edge of your seat. All the characters were enjoyable to spend time with, we got zombified dogs, and a story that kept a bit of intrigue as to what everyone's motives were, while also being intelligent enough to keep my full, undivided attention throughout. The demise of all the people involved was interesting and to have a film end badly for all was a nice breath of fresh air. Alice does wakes up at the end, alone in a ravaged city, but she is definitely not in a position to rest up or smile at her good fortune.The transition into the second film is then seamless. We find that she didn't just wake up, but in fact is an experiment let loose on a city that cannot be saved. Our two survivors from the original are now pitted against each other to see which is the better soldier, and therefore the more effective military weapon. This fight is the entire story, though, as far as the main mythology goes. Otherwise, we have Alice and her new band of warriors on the lookout for the virus' creator's daughter. In effect, then, the whole story could have been told in about twenty minutesthey go in and get the child, Alice and Nemesis fight, boom, the film is over. However, the tale is padded with huge action sequences and gory zombie carnage. With the addition of Mike Epps to the cast, we are also treated with some nice comic relief, missing somewhat from the first besides Michelle Rodriguez's sarcastic quips. I never minded the simplicity of it all because it never tried to be more than what it was. I stuck with it until the conclusion and found myself even more excited for the third part. The setup had so much potential. Alice was fully formed, all her memory intact, and a new ability in telekinesis. With Nemesis gone and the zombies no match for her, we could finally get to see the showdown between her and the Corporation itself.And with that, we are treated to Extinction. It starts off pretty good with a cloned Alice being put through tests in a mock-up version of the mansion from the first film. It gets intriguing to hear what the scientists have been up to and to learn that Alice is outside trying to find survivors and keep herself off the grid. Then we get the first sign of trouble, an action scene that has nothing to do with the plot. Let's kill some hicks in the desert. If that wasn't enough, we also get a twenty-minute fight between our survivors and crowsyes those pesky black birds, newly infected. Sure the payoff is great, but really we are now halfway through the film and all that has happened is Alice found her old friends. We already knew she had powers and that her blood was special and could mean everything to the project. At the end of the film, that is the exact same knowledge we are left with. Besides many deaths and what could be the beginnings of a complete trainwreck of a sequel, starring no one else but Jovovich, (you'll understand when you see it), we learn absolutely nothing as far as mythology goes. I felt cheated and let down greatly because this film could have done so much more.In conclusion, the trilogy starts strong and ends with a disappointing whimper. The first had everything you could have wanted in a sci-fi/zombie/action flick. Scares, plot twists, and loads of violence and gore rounded out the successful entry. In came the second, lacking substance, but making up for it with flare. More characters, which never hurt the proceedings, more blood, more action, and more monsters can only mean non-stop enjoyment. And if the film doesn't deserve an extra point or two for Sienna Guillory's Jill Valentine, then you must have watched a different film from me. Next came the unfortunate failure of a third. What is less even than a bridge to the inevitable fourth, (will the box-office be enough to warrant it?), this last entry is a wasted opportunity to add to a nice little franchise.Resident Evil 7/10 RE: Apocalypse 7/10 RE: Extinction 3/10",3,8,19,21 September 2007
Zodiac," I am not AveryZodiac
","As much a real life story film as one can be, Zodiac goes through the years chronicling the hunt for the serial killer that got away. There isn't the graphic gore quality we've become accustomed to with Seven and Fight Club, but instead a taut thriller that keeps the viewer on edge, not knowing what bit of history would be coming at them next. Usually this type of film bores me, especially being one I know going in that the killer is never caught, yet Fincher really has control of the pacing and delivers one of the fastest three hour movies I've seen in awhile.Our main entry point into the story lies with cartoonist Robert Graysmith, the man whose books the film was based on, played perfectly by Jake Gyllenhaal. No one plays shy, boyish charm, naïveté like he does. What would seem strange casting for a man who ends up devoting his life to finding out who the Zodiac was, Gyllenhaal ends up being the only choice you can think of once we find that Graysmith's nickname, behind his back, is 'retard.' He truly portrays the socially awkward, outcast Boy Scout we need to follow. Only a guy with his likability and lack of ego could get as many people involved in the case to help him find the material he needed.Besides Gyllenhaal though, we have a stellar supporting cast. Every frame that passes brings us another cameo from a known actor. Sure comedies of late have been cameo vehicles, but this one seems to have had Hollywood knocking on Fincher's door to be included. From non- existent parts by Adam Goldberg, and recognizable faces Tom Verica and Jimmi Simpson, to small roles from Dermot Mulroney, Elias Koteas, and Brian Cox, we have a non-stop who's who of acting talent. Fincher must have been a big '24' fan as well casting Paul Schulze in a real bad wig as a witness for the cops' main suspect in the case, Arthur Leigh Allen, (played with scene-stealing ability by John Carroll Lynch). There are a couple nice meaty roles to go with the cameos led by the always fantastic Robert Downey Jr. It has been stated the Downey and Fincher butted heads a bit during filmingI mean this is Mr. Unpredictable Ad-lib working for Mr. Perfectionist shooting 25 takes of a one minute scenebut the result is great. Downey brings a comic relief that is needed amongst the violence and drama, yet also plays his descent into drugs and unreliability to perfection. In the end, the real star of the film, in my opinion, becomes Mark Ruffalo. He plays Inspector David Toschi who truly becomes embedded into the case and never able to break free of it. Ruffalo can always play the regular guy in irregular situations without making it seem like acting. His reactions to Downey's character's misstep in info leaking are real, as is his passion and emotion during the course of secretly working with Graysmith during the last act of the film. Toschi is the man that I feel the audience can relate to most during the manhunt and I wish he had been given more of a central role to the movie. Although the film is successful at telling the story of forty years of the Zodiac, the plethora of characters cause it to be a bit sprawling and unfocused. Graysmith wrote the story, and he is our lead, yet we lose him for a good hour of the film to follow the police/newspaper's efforts at finding the killer's identity. Sure Gyllenhaal is in the background often, but sometimes you wonder where he went and once you get comfortable with Ruffalo being in charge, back comes Jake to take the lead again. It almost feels like two films cut together as a whole. Not to say the editing is bad because in actuality the film is real smooth transitionally. We are given snippets that are pertinent to the eventually findings by Graysmith and Toschi, and never more than necessary. When it comes to movies on a strict timeline, this is one of the best.I feel that Fincher could have had another masterpiece, but just couldn't commit to one viewpoint. He definitely did his research into the case and jam packed details wherever he could. However, the tagline for the film is 'There's more than one way to lose your life to a killer' and yet it was never really taken to the next level. Sure we see the strain the case has on Ruffalo, Gyllenhaal, and Anthony Edward's family life, but on second thought, do we really? Edward's family is never shown and he eventually quits the case, Ruffalo's wife is supporting to the fullest and he remains balanced for perpetuity; even Gyllenhaal's Graysmith, so deep into his research that his family leaves him, never seems too upset about it. He is more, 'I'll take care of our problems once this is done,' and doesn't really seem to care that he has been left. So, basically in effect, rather than a character piece on how the case effects those involved, we get a strict thriller on the hunt for a killer. Yes, it is not Fincher's best, but as a film it is effective. We get some nice flourishes with the camera (the opening pan with stationary camera through car window, overhead/bird's eye following of cars, and a gorgeous sequence traveling over the fog engulfed bridge of the poster) and some great acting, just nothing really special, screaming out at us to see its importance. Also, where was the Fincher-staple creative credit sequence? All in all Zodiac ends up being an enjoyable ride, that, if nothing else, whets your appetite for more darkness to come from his singular mind.",8,7,13,29 March 2007
Milk," We gotta give 'em hope  Milk
","I have to admit that I forgot Gus Van Sant knew how to make films with a linear storyline. The man is a visionary with My Own Private Idaho standing as one of my personal favorites and, a little more recently, Elephant being a testament to craft succeeding beyond a need for dialogue. But of course, the film everyone loves is that Damon/Affleck darling Good Will Hunting, and I do too. Mix them all together, add some non-fiction, and you'll come close to Milk, the real life tale of Harvey Milk, the first openly gay person to be elected to public office. Here is a man that stood up for civil rights; stood up for humanity itself. A mountain of a man inside of a slight frame and genial disposition, Milk never forgot his roots or put himself ahead of the movement. The 'Mayor of Castro Street' didn't fight for issueshe fought for lives. It's a story people need to hear; a story, not about gay rights, but about what it means to be alive, to live and breathe freely, without fear of always looking behind you. It's about being accepted for you.Our hero is the narrator, orating a goodbye letter via cassette tape just in case one of the multiple death threats he receives happens to come true. Milk sits at his kitchen table remembering the good times and the bad, the fights won and lost, on his journey that changed history as we know it. This man single-handedly stood against the system for the gay community to finally shed their insecurities, to believe that someone was on their side. A New Yorker stuck in a dead-end job, hiding his real identity to keep work while cruising the streets and subways for sexual encounters, wakes up on his fortieth birthday to move cross-country and start it all over; this time making his life one of meaning and hopefully something to be proud of. That prophetic night in bed, with his new love and muse Scott, began a revolution that no one saw comingnot America, not the gay community of San Francisco, and definitely not Milk himself.Milk truly fires on all cylinders. The story is dynamite, one that I'm ashamed to admit I knew very little about  besides a cursory knowledge of who Milk was and an off-handed idea of 'the Twinkie defense' without actually knowing any details of it. I've heard a lot about the documentary The Times of Harvey Milk, and after checking out this film, I really want to see it to get more of the facts and see the actual people involved, moreso than the quick photos shown before the ending credits here. And the acting cannot be faulted at all  well maybe it can where Diego Luna is concerned, however, his role is meant to be over-the-top and not well liked, so in fact he might have done it perfectly. I've already mentioned Sean Penn, embodying this man completely, who will most definitely get a nomination, and, a nostalgic bid to give Mickey Rourke gold withstanding, probably a victory. The thing I love about Penn is that no matter how big he is in his celebrity or how recognizable his face is, when he portrays a role, it is always just the character on screen.A large cast of faces you know and love, mixed with some up-and-comers that may trigger a memory of seeing them before, fill out the film nicely. Guys like Joseph Cross and Denis O'Hare add some authenticity and Alison Pill holds her own as really the only front and center female role. Besides Franco, though, two more men demand special mention, and they are Emile Hirsch and Josh Brolin. Hirsch shines as Cleve Jones, a charismatic kid from Phoenix that, like the others around Harvey, takes to the political activism and begins to enjoy fighting for change. And then there is Brolin, continuing again in his career renaissance as the troubled Supervisor Dan White. Battling his own demons and his own identity in a community that expects certain things from him, White's story is just as heartbreaking as Milk's, even if he is the cause of everything tragic that occurs. It is a subtle performance that shines bright as a result.But it isn't all about the people, it is also very much about Van Sant's unique visual eye. He utilizes many tricks from his repertoire: the final walk by Brolin in City Hall calling to memory Elephant's long takes of character movement and the title cards for Milk's campaign bearing a resemblance to Idaho's similarly colored locale headings. However, it is the precise handling of the subject matter that shines. From the cut scenes of archival footage, real newsreels and interviews with people such as Anita Bryant, to the graphic stylings of voter punches falling through the air, to a magnificent shot mirrored off of the side of a whistlebeautiful to behold and meaningful due to the reason they were assembled for that scene to begin withit's all memorable. Even his use of static close-ups help tell the emotive workings of all that is going on. Whether it a moving phone call from Paul in Minnesota or an exchange with Scott during a sunrise at the end, Van Sant is at the top of his game and Milk will definitely stand as one of his finest works.",9,2,6,2 December 2008
The Prestige," Are you watching closely?The Prestige
","Well it appears Oscar season is upon us. The release of all the films studios have been hiding from projectors until they can be freshly ingrained in voters' minds has commenced. We had the obligatory Scorsese film a couple weeks ago and now we have the return of one of Hollywood's new favorite sons (who also began with intelligent and original indie visions like Marty) with Christopher Nolan's The Prestige. Known for uniquely dark and smart suspense thrillers, Nolan has crafted a tale of mysterious intrigue concerning two rival magicians vying to be the greatest to have ever lived. One is a performer of high esteem (Hugh Jackman), if not talented enough to create his own tricks, and the other a wizard with sleight of hand (Christian Bale) yet stoic and matter-of-fact with his audience. Obsession overcomes the humanity of each as they soon delve into the darkness of their core beings to prove themselves superior. If you truly wish to succeed, you must be willing to get your hands dirty.I must say that I usually hate figuring out a movie's secret before its' big reveal at the conclusion. To say that Nolan has laid his out for all to see purposely might not be far from the truth. I hope he has done so consciously as it adds immensely to the film's enjoyability. This is a film about illusion and tricks that can be explained if necessary. The beauty of magic, however, is the audience's unconscious desire to never find out what really happened. As one character says in the film, it becomes so obvious once the trick has been unraveled. What a movie like The Illusionist failed to do was accept the intelligence of its audience. They tried so hard to hide the telestrated finale that when it finally happened you felt cheated. Nolan understands what is so appealing about illusion, we want to figure out what happens ourselves, to see the obvious and apply it to the cloaked result. He tells the tale like a magic trick, showing his hand the entire way yet still being able to keep the film suspenseful and enjoyable right to the final frame as we wait to see what direction we are led.Bale and Jackman prove themselves to be the heavyweights that they are in the acting field. They embody their characters fully and are able to go from friendly comradery to bitter hatred throughout the course of this labyrinthine story bouncing from flashback to flashback. The rivalry is tautly told as they begin to discover a new layer of the other with each diary page turn, stolen from their counterpart. These are actors playing performers who have chosen a life for themselves, where they must act every single day. Their personas for stage and family are not the same, and this disparity helps to slowly destroy them both. Sacrifice and pain will always supercede love and happiness for a person driven to be the best at what they do.Surprising applause goes to Scarlett Johansson for a performance that doesn't try to be more than it is. She is not bad as a supporting character when there isn't much for her to destroy. The half-smile/pursed lips look runs rampant, but doesn't reek amateurism as it usually does when she attempts to carry a film herself. The true supporting roles, however, lie with Andy Serkis and David Bowie as assistant to and Nikola Tesla respectively. It is a real shame that Bowie doesn't act more, as I have never seen a bad performance from him thus far after now five films. He embodies the mysterious enigma that Tesla was: a mad-scientist of sorts trying to help the world with his often-irregular ideas. It is also a pleasure to see Serkis not being just a prop like he has been as Golem and King Kong in Peter Jackson's last two epics. The guy has some real screen presence and the ability to transform into whatever a director needs for his film.It is also good to see Nolan go back to the inventive storytelling that he became noticed for. While not as intricate as his debut Following (told in a story pattern consisting of three timeframes going a, b, c, a, b, c) and his masterpiece sophomore effort Memento (told backwards in small chunks), The Prestige is not a straight-forward story like his last film Batman Begins or the lone-blemish on his resume, the inferior remake to a great Norwegian suspenser, Insomnia. The use of flashback, while both characters read the diary of each other, is a nice device which never feels gimmicky. These are stories of intelligent men and who better to narrate for the audience then the leads themselves as they narrate for each other. Dark thrillers don't come better than this one very often and while the touches of science fiction and the supernatural may turn some realists off towards the film's conclusion, I believe they work well within the confines of the world we are being shown. Every sacrifice taken is the obvious conclusion to its' string of events, leading up to the final dénouement that will leave your minds in contemplation, not from confusion so much as an evaluation of your own ways of living and lengths you are willing to go, for hours to follow.",9,2,4,22 October 2006
Hellboy II: The Golden Army," Which Holocaust shall be chosen?  Hellboy 2: The Golden Army
","Guillermo del Toro goes behind the camera again to continue the saga of everyone's favorite demon on Earth, working for the government to fight evil, in Hellboy 2: The Golden Army. Having already worked on a sequel in his career with Blade II, I had high hopes for this work to improve upon the solid first installment. Being that he was the second director in as many films for that vampire series, he was able to come in with a fresh eye. Here, however, he may be too close to the material and thus been subjected to the sophomore curse of trying to be bigger and better, yet only making it stuffed with fluff rather anything with increasing value. By no means is the movie unentertaining or enjoyable, on the contrary it is a good action flick. My problems lie with the fact that del Toro decided to leave behind the simplicity of tone and plot that worked so well in the first. Instead he has brought to screen a bloated, highly comedic, and much lighter entry to the series. The transitions between laughs and borderline melodramatic moments are too abrupt and confusing without any time to recover from one before going to the other. With a few cringe-inducing scenes evened out by some stellar effects, creatures, and choreographed fights, Hellboy 2 ends up being a mixed bag whose whole isn't consistent enough to allow us to forget those times when it does derail.While not as bad as Spider-man 3, I can't help but think of comparing the two. The overly hammy nature of the two are somewhat similar with a scene here with Abe and Hellboy singing Barry Manilow while drinking Tecate recalling the horrid emo Peter Parker jazzing it up downtown in Spidey. What worked in the first film was the subtle infusion of wit to counteract the dark nature of the actual storyline. In the sequel, the comedy actually takes center stage during the first two-thirds of the duration. Ron Perlman plays it up wonderfully, but it just became overkill for me. Trying to fit in as many one-liners as possible, the jabs started to take away from the story being told. Every time something important seems to be explained, it gets turned on its head with a laugh, cute at first, but annoyingly counterproductive after numerous instances.I understand the fact that this is Hellboy trying to come out to the world, trying to become a celebrity and get the credit he feels he deserves. With that aspect he of course needs to play to the cameras and the rockstar sensibility they bring. In my opinion, they just took it too far, especially the Jeffrey Tambor role of Manning, the head of the government operation. He has been turned into a whiner and loses any respect he had from the first movie. I truly believe this is due to the fact that the filmmakers have decided to inject as much as they can into the film. There is just too much Tambor, watering down what works about his character and making him into a prop to be played with by Hellboy. This is not the only piece of the puzzle that has been given exponentially increased screen time. The sheer number of creatures is mind-boggling. Between the scene in the Troll Marketvery reminiscent of the Mos Eisley spaceport on Tatooine in Star Wars: A New Hopeand just the random baddies thrown in throughout, we are assaulted by monsters and costumes at every turn. Don't get me wrong, the effects work is impeccable and some of the races top-notch, it is just once again overkill. The elves are fantastically constructed, Johann Krauss's ectoplasmic self is entertaining, and The Angel of Death is the coolest thing about the entire film. Did we need the tumor-man, or cat-eating troll, or even the forest God? Not really. The first two could have been anything and the giant is he a villain or is he an endangered species of worldly creation could have been any big faceless monster and still have worked.One thing that was grown from the previous installment is the role of Abe Sapien, played once more by the great Doug Jones, (only this time he is allowed to use his own voice rather than a redub from David Hyde Pierce). One the best characters from the first, his increased screen time is welcome despite the hitches into lovey-dovey drivel and badly orchestrated 'drunk' sequence.' His extension might be at the demise of Selma Blair's role, which not only has been pushed to the background fro much of the film, but while being given a cool new fire 'suit' loses the very awesome blue inferno from part one.However, what may be lacking in dramatic weight and darkness is compensated with amazing fight scenes. One thing this once has going for it are moments of brilliance on the battlefields. Luke Goss steals the show with his acrobatics and really steps up in the final fight versus Hellboy. He shows what made him so perfect as the main villain in Blade II and why del Toro decided to bring him on board to recapture that magic. It is the hand-to-hand combat that dazzles and I wish there was more of it to showcase. Even when the titular Golden Army arrives, they fight in a human-like way with arms and legs stabbing with swords. Unfortunately, moreso than not, we are treated with battles of destructions, roads and walls being blown apart by creatures and gunfire, showing how much the American public loves to see explosions. I myself would rather partake in the amazing dance-like work of true professionals doing it all without computer help. Del Toro got a lot right here, but also fell victim to the Hollywood machine, getting a little too big than necessary, watering down the final result.",7,3,8,14 July 2008
Cloverfield," Good luck tonight TravisCloverfield
","Cloverfield is a damn good time at the moviessomething that one can't say very often in January, the month usually utilized to dump films while Oscar-bait from the previous year gets released. Seeing the first teaser attached to Transformers in July literally gave me goosebumps at the potential for what it could be. I will admit that while the hype was high, the past couple months saw it wane. The gimmick started getting a tad stale and the TV spots began to ruin the momentum it carried so well before anyone knew what it was. Producer J.J. Abrams knew what he was doing, though, as the end result exceeded expectations, taking the colossal monster genre as background dressing for the human tale of love and regret which came up front and center. I just feel bad for director Matt Reeves and writer Drew Goddard because it is their film yet everyone describes it as Abrams'. Whoever deserves credit, they are receiving a ton from me. Every detail was painstakingly considered, there were actually some genuine scares (usually hard to come by for me), and the story had some weight and meaning, allowing the fine performances to have something to play for, rather than just running for their lives with egos and self-preservation the only thing worth living for.My main fear was on whether we would see the monster and how that visual would ruin the movie. Stuff like this only truly works for me if the creature creating all the havoc is something foreboding and unseen, always lurking and able to attack at any moment. Here, though, we actually get a look at the behemoth pretty early. From its tale attack on the Brooklyn Bridge to its full visual on TV screens in a local electronics store, we know exactly what it is causing all the destruction. The beauty of the filmmakers is that they never needed the monster for the film to work. It is a secondary character used only as motivation for our lead Rob to hunt out his love Beth and a means to preventing him from reaching her easily. Maybe the world falling apart around them is the catalyst for their feelings to finally boil to the surface, however, the fight is always going on around them; it's not about defeating the enemy, it is about living for something bigger then yourself, doing what you can for the people you love in a time of desperate need.Cloverfield asks a lot of its actors throughout. Filmed on a first-person camera, there are many long takes and unbroken scenes to express the aesthetic choice of this being a real primary account of the invasion found later on after the smoke settles. Emotions run high, death takes a realistic toll on both body and mind, and adrenaline flows forth to keep these heroes on the run to get out of Manhattan alive and intact. Each holds his/her own to make it all seem real, injecting humor so that the bleak moments can break with levity. Death is starring them in the face and, like anyone of us would do in that situation, they try to mask their fear with laughter in order to release some of the tension building higher and higher inside of them. Michael Stahl-David, as Rob, is by far the best of the group. He needs to go from deeply in love to tragically scorned and angry, happily surprised by his friends to scared for his life, and confident to risk his own being for another to devastated as he must explain the death of someone close to him over the phone. His emotions run the gamut and he pulls them all off with grace. Lizzy Caplan, Jessica Lucas, and Odette Yustman hold their own with the immense pressure of their situation weighing down on them as well. When tragedy strikes, and it does often, they must react realistically to every situation. Special mention also goes to T.J. Miller as Hud Platt, our surrogate guide through the mayhem, acting as our camera operator, complete with commentary and comedic relief with every turn.With the strong performances and the taut, simple script from Goddard, I have to praise the work of Reeves at helming the piece. With little to work with in order to have the audience relate to and rally behind these characters, we are thrust into the action pretty early on. Goddard crafted a yarn that succeeds from getting the small things right. Rather than go big budget effects, he relies on the human interactions to portray the action. Reeves understands this and allows for a brilliant documentary feel. If you are susceptible to motion sickness, be warned that the camera is very shaky and possibly even handled by Miller while he chases after his friends. The askew angles and amateurish cropping of frame add to this completely, keeping all the action truncated on the edges because if it were real, the viewer would only look when something catches his eye. Turning to see what they think they saw shows off the end result, increasing the fear and anticipation for what might come next. All the monster effects are adequately rendered and the utilization of digital camera tricksfantastic use of nightvision in the subway, awesome instance of auto-focus confusion with Hud, and precise usage of the fact that this is all taping over a previously filmed event (Rob and Beth's day out in Coney Island) which shows through wonderfullyshown to full effect. Complete with an ending that truly encapsulates what went on this fateful day in NYC, Cloverfield delivers on all its promises and becomes so much more than just Blair Witch Project mainstream. Every moment is real and touches you in a very personal way. It is an experience, a spectacle; not to be confused with the monster movies that only show you what is happening, this one puts you in the action, making you feel it all yourself.",9,3,9,18 January 2008
Silent Hill," Sinners deserve to lose their spawnSilent Hill
","Silent Hill is a study in atmosphere and mood. While some may say it is style over substance, I'd have to agree a bit, but correct the statement to style with substance. Christophe Gans, the visionary director behind a great foreign film Brotherhood of the Wolf, has crafted a film that is visually astonishing while mind-bendingly layered. Credit writer Roger Avary, whom I have yet to be disappointed with anything I've seen containing his involvement, for adapting, not the story exactly, but the emotion and structure which has made the eponymous video game as successful as it has been. While one can look at numerous message boards yelling that this movie is trash compared to the game, the main character's sex has changed, monsters are in that shouldn't be, etc., as a film fan (who has never played nor seen the game played) I need to tell these people that film is a new medium. The transition, in my opinion has gone over practically without a hitch.The acting is superb throughout, a tough sell for a movie of this ilk. Amazingly, Gans was able to compile an on-the-cusp of A-list cast to do the material justice. This is not a hack- em up slasher flick, nor is it a horror of the kind churned out each week to make money. Silent Hill is a stylish art film whose atmosphere haunts. The multi-plane dimensions are reminiscent of the classic Hellraiser movies, along with the creatures that have been manifested from the minds of those being pursued. Each monster here has been created for a reason and does its' job. This is not the real world, but a nightmare come true. Radha Mitchell plays the desperate mother to perfection, showing fear for outside forces and fear for the wellbeing of her child. While under-used, Sean Bean also shows a subdued emotional palette as he searches for his wife and daughter. The always effective Deborah Kara Unger plays the outcast nicely. A mother herself, she must live with the mistake she has made; the devil reaping revenge won't allow her to die, maybe due to the love her daughter still holds, but more realistically because she must live with her sin for eternity. As far as the creepiness scale goes, praise should be awarded to Alice Krige as an overzealous cultist and to young Jodelle Ferland who plays some very disturbing scenes like a pro. Ferland is a credit to some liberal parenting I'm sure, as she is cast as some emotionally wrought children with many skeletons in her subconscious. She plays the layers great and I just can't wait any longer for the much overdue Tideland, directed by auteur Terry Gilliam and starring Jodelle.While the acting surpasses the genre that Hollywood has tried to pigeonhole the movie into, it is the visual style that really impresses. From the first moment in the town of Silent Hill, when the snow falls through the fog, a flake is caught by Radha Mitchell and turns black, the viewer gets an idea of the attention to detail. Each conversion between reality, Silent Hill grey, and menacing darkness is seamlessly orchestrated. Watching the structures of the grey burn to ash, in turn becoming creatures of the darkness after the air-raid siren ceases, is magical. It's even more so when the darkness has come to an end and the creatures turn back to ash and slowly materialize together into walls and doors. The cgi work is top-notch as well as the sound effects. Every industrial sound is placed with care and the use of a score does more for mood than any heavy-metal soundtrack couldwhat seems to be the horror choice of the past decade.Gans had a vision and he filmed it. The cinematography and visuals are a sight to behold and unfortunately for a horror film, not to be appreciated by the audience the studio has targeted. This is not a horror film more than a dark insight into the psychological mind of a scorned child; a child who hadn't developed her mind enough to go past atrocities she has seen and experienced. Because of this, her openness to a deal with the devil can have drastic results. Silent Hill is an intelligent thriller that calls for attention and thought. It is a shame that the filmmakers knew this wouldn't go over with the general audience and had to explain every detail during an extended flashback sequence towards the end of the film. If only Gans had been really creating an independent vision and was allowed to leave surrealism to itself a la David Lynch, I probably would have given this film a perfect score. Instead, money really does talk and when Hollywood wants accessibility, every action must be taken to make the backers happy.",9,1,3,6 September 2006
Once," Just playOnce
","Wow.That's it, one word reviewWow.This is the movie of the year for me right now, and quite possibly will stay that way until next January. With what has to be the simplest story I've seen on screen in a long time, it gets everything right. Once is a perfect little gem, both concise and powerful in a small but infinitely memorable package. Literally, a guy and a girl meet on a street corner in Dublin while he plays guitar for loose change. This chance encounter sets into motion a series of events that will bring kindred souls together with the strongest bond of love and friendship as they both try to reconcile with themselves and give their lost loves a second chance. You can't portray the unfathomable link love holds people together with better than this. These two are not lovers in the traditional sense, but neither will ever be able to forget the friendship they forged and how they helped pull each other out of their respective emotional ruts. They are lovers of the mind and soul.I'll admit that I am a huge sucker for brilliant music in film. Whether it be a musical like Moulin Rouge!, or a story that is enhanced by its soundtrack like The Royal Tenenbaums, or a visually stunning piece set to a haunting score as in The Fountain, I cannot get enough. The power that an assault on the eyes and ears simultaneously has can't be beat. This entire film is shot with hand-held camera, many times subversively, (for instance when our lead Guy and Girl go to a diner for lunch, the camera stays outside looking in, but you can tell the sound is coming from within by tape recorder as the background noise is very noticeable). The graininess and intimate quality shown by this style of film-making only makes you feel the realism that is pouring from each frame. These two actors are singers themselves and accomplished musicians. Glen Hansard and Markéta Irglová are truly and utterly remarkable. Their interactions are never forced or fabricated, this film feels like a behind the scenes documentary on the creation of an album.Once is definitely a musical above anything else. Half of this film takes place with songs either being sung in real time or being played over a montage sequence. Rather than use the words of the music to tell the story, writer/director John Carney uses them to set-up the emotional core and existence for our two leads. The words they sing are meaningful to their characters and how they react after uttering the lyrics can be both joyous and heartbreaking. He must be credited with having the guts to stage many musical moments in single takes, letting the performances and the music take over the scene. To go from the sheer happiness of laying down a track in the studio, to the sorrow-filled moment of Irglová unable to finish singing the song she wrote for her old love, back to the comradery of finishing their demo is a roller-coaster of emotions that sum up the whole film completely. There is not a misstep in sight. From the fateful meeting at our start to the bittersweet perfection that is the final scene, you don't get many opportunities to see original work like this in cinema anymore.",10,12,13,13 June 2007
Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid," For a gunman, you're one hell of a pessimist  Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid
","The Sting is one of my favorite films and so when the opportunity presented itself to see the first pairing of Hill, Newman, and Robert Redford on the big screen, I had to take advantage. Being the earliest success and having an image of one of the best westerns around, I must admit to being somewhat surprised at the humor tossed about at the start. Did I think this would be a serious film? Perhaps, but never did I anticipate it being a buddy comedy to the core with a witty, dynamic duo at the lead. While Newman and Redford definitely steal the show, Butch Cassidy is much more than just two outlaws having fun. Brilliant cinematography, directing, and a few impressive shootouts help prove why this film is held in such high regard.The film is dated, for sure, in many parts. A cheesy rendition of the Oscar winning song 'Raindrops Keep Fallin' on My Head' showing Newman and actress Katherine Ross riding a bike through a farm is one instance, (especially since they weren't even romantically involved), as are the silent time-progressing montages set to similar musical stylings. Heck, the movie even drags a bit due to the flimsy plot at its core. The crux of the story involves the end of robbing banks and trains on horse, and how these two men experience this truth. It is a dead artform and the police and hired hands have gotten too sophisticated to just let criminals getaway. Therefore, one can only witness so many robberies, no matter what country they occur in, without hoping for a little bit more. However, that said, you won't be bored because our anti-heroes refuse to let you. Whether thieving, escaping, going straight, or just laying low, Newman and Redford work together as though they have their entire life. The comedic timing is perfect, the facial expressions genuine, and the audience reaction nothing short of laughter upon laughter.Butch and Sundance, (Newman and Redford respectively), know they are a dying breed, even going so far as saying they may be over the hill in the business. Their return to the Hole in the Wall Gang Cassidy formed proves this with an attempt at usurping power by another member in lieu of a 'welcome back' party. The confidence, or perhaps insanity, in each keeps our leads from ever backing down or giving up. Butch always has a new great idea to make things better and Sundance always has his guns at the ready to make sure those plans can occur. It is a pairing of brains and brawn like any other, two friends living the high life by stealing and spending lavishly, looking for the next big score, the next slice of danger, or, if they're lucky, both. They've been at it for a long time at the point to which we are introduced, and they have a set system that has worked in the past. Sometimes people take things personally, however, and change the rules. You can only knock off the Union Pacific so often before its owner enlists a posse of hired hands to kill his enemies by paying more than they even steal from him. Now that is a grudge if I've ever heard one.You definitely can't discount the Oscar-winning cinematography from Conrad L. Hall either. His use of blocking and framing is pretty great and the ability to always have the leads in the foreground while still seeing the hunters on their trail in the distant desert is an impressive feat. Scenes like watching the torch lights split up in the nighttime distance, only to see them join up again in pursuit show the kind of planning that went into this production. And Hill also decided to be inventive in his process of editing and progression as well. The movie begins nicely with old silent film footage of the gang stealing from trains on a projection while the credits roll to its right, showing how the medium itself will be utilized to help tell the story. While there are more traditional montages, like the exploits of the Bandidos Yanquis with help from Ross's Etta Place in Bolivia, the most memorable sequence of time-lapse comes from a collage. Yes, the traveling from out west to New York to South America is told through sepia-toned photographs taken along the way. I can only guess that Roger Avary had this moment in mind when he chose to similarly show Victor's European vacation in Rules of Attraction.Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid is by far more buddy comedy than weighty Once Upon a Time in the West fare, but that is not a bad thing. There are definite themes of time passing and men attempting to grow old, yet, sometimes, seeing that the job just can't be left behind. You don't become career criminals expecting to live a long life; you do it for the adventure and the fun a quick fortune can bring. The film does get a tad serious towards the end, especially when the world begins to fall around them and Ross starts to put into action her promise of following them anywhere as long as she doesn't have to be there when they are killed, but at the same time never loses its comedic edge. These two affable bad guys smile in the face of fear and as a result give us a very memorable conclusion to the adventure. With a brilliant freeze-frame, letting the end occur in the minds of the viewers, Hill caps one heck of a ride with the best action and banter yet. There is nothing like saving one's best for last to leave an impression.",8,2,3,8 August 2009
Pan's Labyrinth," My mother told me to be wary of faunsPan's Labyrinth
","Finally Buffalo is able to see the phenomenon Pan's Labyrinth for itself. All the hype and the acclaim have definitely raised expectations for this film by visionary Guillermo del Toro. For myself, I really just wanted to see a del Toro film outside of the Hollywood realm. Sure I liked both Blade II and Hellboy, but it's the other Spanish language films, Cronos and The Devil's Backbone, that have been intriguing me for years. After watching his latest effort, I can say nothing less than that I can't wait to check those other two out even more. Pan's is an amazing feat of imagination and great storytelling put together as no one else could.The one aspect that lingers upon its completion is the fact that everything that occurred seemed so original, and each plot progression a surprise. Maybe this fact impresses me more because of the homage to other films. Many things here are so familiar and have been seen before, yet each instance seems fresh. The ability to make these activities his is astonishing. Also, the deft handling of the fairy-tale narrative with its real world war counterpart is expertly done. The film never delves completely into the mythical realm, (actually this fact disappointed me), and keeps its two paths running parallel while also enhancing each other. There are some very nice transitions between both environments as well as great editing montages showing glimpses of each at one time.In the end, this film is about war and fighting for what you believe is right. When the time comes to defeat an unjust tyrant, you need to be willing to sacrifice yourself for the cause of humanity. We are thrown into a civil war in Spain against the regime that has recently taken over. The rebels refuse to back down to a general, (Sergi López exuding his malicious intent at every turn), who is a brutal warlord that does not see all of Spain as equal. This monster is not just up against the people's guerilla rebellion, however, but also on the other side of his stepdaughter's quest for identity. Young Ofelia, played magnificently by Ivana Baquero in a role that normally plays in child-fare yet needs a greater sense of weight in an adult tale like this, (it is R-rated after all), sees her mother making the error of marrying this ruthless army man. Her mother is sick with child after the general made them travel late in her pregnancy in order to see his heir born. With utter disregard for all but his namesake, Ofelia must disappear into her imagination to find out what she is truly made of. With the death of her father and the slow detachment to her mother, the child puts herself into a fantasy story she has read about a girl from an underground world that came to the surface, allowing for her soul to remain forever. Ofelia takes the mantle of this princess and begins her quest to leave the atrocities happening around her for the royal life of a happier realm.I really like the fact that del Toro was not afraid to make this film for adults. The underlying morality is similar to Jim Henson's Labyrinth, yet here it does not cater to a young sensibility. This is not a girl renouncing her brother and needing to go on a quest to discover her love for others, this is a child trapped amongst the hell that earth can be. Death and pain surround her at all turns and she then must manifest that danger into her fantasies of survival. There are no cute and cuddly creatures on display here. The fairies guiding her are created from insects and have agendas of their own, the conduit between worlds, Pan, is an aging faun with a temper and disgust for humanity, and the evil entities are truly scary, (the toad and the Pale Man). There is blood, and lots of it, throughout the duration, whether during battle scenes or not. This is the world these characters are living in and rather than cop-out saying Ofelia is just a child who does not understand the gravity of what's happening, del Toro allows her to not only realize everything, but be the one that the audience watches battle through the hardships.All fantasy moments are beautifully orchestrated and gorgeous to look at. Whether at the portal to the underground world with Pan, to the majestic hallway of the Pale Man, you really get to see the director's imagination to full effect. I don't believe it could have been pulled off quite as effectively without Doug Jones becoming these mythical beings. Like he did as Abe Sapien in Hellboy, he truly creates these creatures and makes them real through motion. Maribel Verdú is also amazing as heart and soul to Ofelia while her mother lays sick in bed. The relationship these two strike up is necessary to counteract what is happening with the war, and her Verdú's involvement in that story thread is also effective.My only real problem with this film, a true visceral masterpiece otherwise, is the treatment of the mystical storyline. While it is executed to perfection, it is merely just an afterthought to what is happening. The fantasy aspect almost appears to only serve a purpose in keeping Ofelia away from the battles and never truly fleshes itself into its own unique identity. I wish for there to have been more fantastical elements rather than just being used as an escape. With that said, however, the conclusion truly is as effective as it can be in bringing the two worlds together. Del Toro surprises again, right to the end, unafraid to finish a fairytale against the genre's usual type.",9,2,4,21 January 2007
Knocked Up," I need to change chairsKnocked Up
","Can Seth Rogen and Judd Apatow strike gold twice in as many tries? Well I guess you can say they had success together with TV shows 'Freaks and Geeks' and 'Undeclared,' but then, despite what seemed to be universal love, both got cancelled. It wasn't until The 40 Year Old Virgin hit that they started becoming household names. With Apatow's follow-up, Knocked Up, he has brought his old friend out from the shadows and into the spotlight. Rogen definitely has the talent to hit it out of the park, but as far as the film itself striking gold as its predecessor did for me, I have to say it comes up a bit short. Let's just say it strikes silver.Our story is one that occurs probably too often in the real world, a one-night stand which produces offspring. We are of course privy to the obligatory abortion sequence, although short and never mentioned in lieu of 'smushmortion,' but the real impetus to the movie is these two finding each other and common ground to raise a child. Right from the get go, both leads want the baby and work hard in order to achieve their goal, slowly finding out that they may have real feelings for the other. After recently checking out the fantastic hijinks from the previous Steve Carell film, I expected to be laughing non-stop here. The plot is laced with seriousness, but ripe for satire and hilarity. What ends up happening, however, is that the jokes are merely window dressing for the tale of love conquering all. All the serious issues at play are very much in the forefront and Knocked Up ends up being an entertaining date movie first, uproarious comedy second. This is by no means a bad thing, it just wasn't exactly what I was anticipating going in. In the end it works to balance the two directions, although somewhat precariously because when the laughs arrive they are huge, only making the serious parts that much more sobering and ultimately a tad boring.Apatow again succeeds with flying colors as far as scripting a story with heart and realism. He pulls no punches at all and never goes into the realm of schtick or surrealism. You have to applaud the man for going so far as to showing the baby crowning during birth as well as actually giving the mother a slimy child rather than a cleaned off 'prop' instead. We are witnessing the relationship between two strangers as they are thrust into each other's lives. It is absolutely paramount that we see the reality of the situation and understand where each is coming from throughout all their activities and actions. Maybe the lack of Carell co-writing led to the somewhat more subdued end result, but even so, this film is very funny.Let's just say that I would pay to watch two hours of Seth Rogen and Paul Rudd in a room riffing with one another alone. Every time these two share screen time is the best moment of the film. Their film quote referencing, Back to the Future and Swingers being some of the best, are classic and the rapport they share is genuine, most is surely ad-libbed. As for the casting of Rogen's friends, what better way to do so than with his real friends? The foursome all play characters sharing their own first names and the comradery and insults are so spot- on it once again must be mostly improvised. Every sly jab at the one for being in a bet not allowing him to shave is priceless. For him to be the one they are grateful is not a Jew to eventually being thought of as one because of the facial hair is a great evolutionMatisyahu anyone?As for the rest of the cast, Katherine Heigl truly shines as the woman at the center of it all. Her life is flipped upside down and her emotions run high. I have not seen her in anything elseno I have not watched 'Grey's Anatomy' as of yetbut I have to say I was impressed by her performance. While talking of acting range I will also mention the phenomenal job Rogen did himself. Always being the funny guy coming into scenes, he really needed to step up here and carry the film. His character undergoes a huge transformation during the course of the movie and Rogen makes every moment of it believable. Other credit goes to the entire Apatow family. His wife Leslie Mann is finally given a role she can run with besides the usual ten-minute butt of the joke scenes I'm used to seeing her partake in. Also, their children, playing her children in the film, are immensely funny. Their interactions together in the car and the eldest's story of where babies come from are quite memorable. Oh and one needs to congratulate Ryan Seacrest with a wonderful bit of self-parody and the other friends popping up like Carell and James Franco.So, in the end, Apatow delivers a heartfelt tale of love mixed with a good amount of humor, both sweet and broad. While definitely an R-rated feature with many moments of hilarity due to graphic language and or actions, I would still say this is more for the date crowd than the group of friends going out for a Friday night. The laughs are there, and big in most instances, however, the end result is really a romantic comedy when you look closely. It may be the crudest rom-com you'll see, but it also is one of the more effective ones.",7,2,7,1 June 2007
Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street," May I have your attention, puh-lease!...Sweeney Todd
","Stephen Sondheim's musical Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street is not your run-of-the-mill Broadway spectacle. This thing is dark, gory, and bleak to the end with little in the way of joy and hope seeping through. I had seen the staged production featuring George Hearn and Angela Lansbury a couple years back, so I was familiar with the story before sitting down to experience Tim Burton's vision. I guess by knowing Sondheim's other musical Into the Woods, he is accustomed to darker, off-kilter works, however, this one is way out there. A story that involves a falsely imprisoned barber returning to London in order to seek revenge on the judge that put him there, and subsequently stole his wife and daughter, by slitting throats and hiding the bodies in the city's best meat pies is not winning any feel-good awards. More a cult phenomenon than a huge Broadway success, I think it may find a new audience in theatres, if for nothing else but the inclusion of Johnny Depp. He alone will draw some viewers in, especially those that the trailer fooled into thinking it isn't wall-to-wall singing. Oh, and so I don't mislead you, when I say musical and non-stop singing, don't think you'll be toe-tapping on the way home. These songs won't be sticking in your head.Aesthetically, Burton has knocked this one out of the park. The muted grays really help the bright red blood pop off the screen as well as make the 'fantasy' dream sequence even funnier than it is by itself, allowing it to have such vibrant colors. This is London at its dingiest, grime-filled in every shot. Cinematically, all the framing is unique and never boring, especially in scenes where our two leads share a duet and we see them in fore and background, even through reflections on the straightedge razor. As for the bloodbesides the hokey, watered-down red streams coming from bare necksit is handled well. It's more realistic once the initial spurts are concludedturning into thick ooze on the floorbut I guess the fakeness helps add a little necessary humor to the otherwise depressing tale.This film is by all accounts a Tim Burton enterprise. From the look and feel to the casting of his wife and Depp, this is a much-anticipated return to his earlier films for me. After his recent string of horrible remakes in Planet of the Apes and Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, I was almost ready to write him off. If not for the wonderful Big Fish in the middle of those, I might have been really apprehensive in going to see this, especially since it is pretty much a remake itself. Thankfully, besides it dragging a bit in the middle, (the play does too, though, so I don't fault Burton), and the storyline with Anthony and Joanna being so thin and almost thrown in haphazardly, the movie really surprised me with its humor and unabashed use of violence. I would have been very disappointed if he toned it down rather than amped it up as he does.All the acting is surprisingly great too. Depp is fantastic and subtle in his portrayal of Benjamin Barker turned Sweeney Todd, hiding the pent-up aggression as best he can before finally needing at outlet of murder. He could have gone over-the-top with it, as he unfortunately did in Charlie, but instead reined it in and probably came off funnier as a result, specifically with the facial expressions in the fantasy scene and throughout. While I don't think he could have done the play on stage, I still think vocally he did a superb job. The rasp and the deep baritone fit perfectly and his depressed state adds to the tragic end soon to come. Helena Bonham Carter, Alan Rickman, and Timothy Spall are all good in their roles, nothing special, but totally fitting the aestheticif anything Carter and Spall may be a bit too creepy. The real supporting standouts, though, are young Ed Sanders as Toby and the hilarious Sacha Baron Cohen as Signor Petrelli, a rival barber. Cohen is a master of priceless voices and adds a nice layer to the proceedings.Sweeney Todd is not a perfect film and definitely not one for the masses, but as far as a cult musical with gore, it does the job. If anything, I hope this means good things for Burton's cinematic future. He is at his best with dark tales like Beetlejuice, Edward Scissorhands, and Batman and should stay away from the remake machine. Always gorgeous to watch, this one has some substance to it as well. A perfect ending definitely helps make up for the missteps along the journey too.",8,2,5,28 December 2007
Blades of Glory," Sex on iceBlades of Glory
","It's a real shame that Hollywood churns out some utter crap passed off as entertainment. The new low-brow comedy Blades of Glory has a great premise: two old skating rivals team together, after being banned for life in competition, as the first all male pair to fight for gold at the World Championships. This was ripe for some social commentary, a little out of their element shtick, and a touch of big laugh action sequences. What we get instead are two lead actors doing what they do in every movie they are in and a whole lot of name actors being as effeminate as they possibly can because I guess gay men in the skating community equals a huge laugh riot. I will admit that this film had some funny moments and also some decent acting, but overall the production was shoddy and relied way too much on its stars to bring the fun amidst many redundant routines.Anyone who reads my reviews knows that I am not a big Will Ferrell fan. Sure I loved him in Stranger Than Fiction, and he can make me laugh hard at times (Old School), but in the end, his boorish, blowhard persona ends up coming into every comedic character he has. I guess if it cashes the checks why add nuance? He does much of the same here and if you like that, than you'll probably be entertained throughout. As far as Jon Heder, I won't go as far as some reviews I've heard, saying the kid can't act or cause laughs if his life depended on it, however, he doesn't really succeed in his role. I think he worked really well with his adopted father, played with a one-note performance by William Fichtner, but that only lasts about five minutes. When he is alone and with Ferrell he goes into a geeky tantrum trying to prove his manhood, and it just doesn't work.On the other hand, the husband and wife team of Will Arnett and Amy Poehler is humorous as the competition. Their schemes are enjoyable and Arnett's dimwittedness is a nice foil to Poehler's take-charge emotional blackmailing of their sister into doing their dirty work. That sister, played by Jenna Fischer, is the best part of this film. She plays the cute yet shy girl well and her naïveté mixed with her ability to look the part of a sex-fiend or wholesome woman works perfectly in the role. I also enjoyed Romany Malco. No matter how much I don't want to applaud one of the many 'acting gay' performances, I thought his reactions were spot on. Maybe it was because he is the total opposite on the brilliant show 'Weeds,' but when he just stares, shaking his head at what is set before him, I always chuckled.The thing I can't forgive is the horrible use of special effects on the skating sequences. All the cuts to extreme close-ups after long shots were annoying by themselves, (I know these actors can't do the moves themselvesat least don't go back and forth so much making it obvious), but when they tried digitally grafting Ferrell's and Heder's faces onto the faces of the real skaters I was literally cringing. The faces were stretched on and totally fake. Also, when the actors were participating in a difficult move, the movement became stilted and stop-motion-like from the amateurish wirework. When one was lifted into the air, the fast paced camera-work zoomed out and the actors slowly moved around until they touched back down to the ice. And then what do we get? Oh, yeah, a close-up of the actors to make sure we don't forget they are the ones doing the skating. One more thing, too, is the overuse of the TV background footage of how they got there. This movie is the king of using clichés and gimmicks til the very end instead of spicing things up with an original idea.Despite it all, though, I can't give Blades of Glory a totally dismal mark because of one priceless scene. When Will Arnett and Will Ferrell are in a chase to get to the stadium on skates, I couldn't stop laughing. Sure it was all normal and stupid when they put their skates on and race to the skating complex in the distance, but when they set foot onto pavement and the chase slows to a crawl as they try not to fall, I loved it. Granted, I would have liked them to do more with the escalator, (why show us their skates lodging in the grooves of the steps if they don't get stuck at the top?), however, once the crossbow comes into play all is redeemed. The scene reminded me a lot of the backstreet brawl in Anchorman, another film I abhorred, and wouldn't mind if I had the opportunity to see just that one scene again.",4,3,6,12 April 2007
Ocean's Thirteen," Are you watching Oprah?Â…Ocean's 13
","Many people I have heard from plain despised Ocean's 12 when they saw it. They complained of its weak plot and unreal goofiness. However, I found it to be very entertaining despite all of that. What the first film had as far as intelligence and wit, the second had in cool and fun. Sure the story was far-fetched and convoluted, but I'd pay to see these guys having fun on screen anytime. I don't go to a film like this to be intellectually stimulated, I go to be entertained. What all this really boils down to is that I was looking forward to the third installment, appropriately named Ocean's 13, to see where these characters would go. Steven Soderbergh does not disappoint and, in fact, creates a nice mix of the first two movies. We are given a smartly orchestrated heist along with the great one-liners and facial expressions that made the second such a good time. I may say it is the best of the three, but if not it is at least as good as the first.Once again revenge is paramount. Our crew's backer, wonderfully played by Elliot Gould per usual, has been double-crossed and bedridden by a heart attack as a result of another casino owner played by Al Pacino. George Clooney, Brad Pitt, and their cohorts offer Pacino a peace offering, but once that is thrown in their faces, the movie starts hitting its stride. Stylistically you can't argue about the structure used to show the viewers how the plan will work. While trying to speak about a problem that needs fixing to a friend, Clooney and Pitt go through how everything will go down while we are visually shown the progress in each. This maneuver is at first a tad distracting, but once you get used to it you find how effective it was in getting a whole lot of info out in a short amount of time. The rest of the film then just leaves the boys to make sure the job gets done. There are pitfalls and unforeseen alliances that come into play, and of course comedy follows them all.As with the first two films, especially the second, we have a lot of characters that just cannot get ample screen time to really be effective. It is not as noticeable here, though, because they are oftentimes on screen separately doing what they have to do rather than all together with only two of the group talking. Everyone gets a decent sized monologue or gimmick to show their stuff, and I'm sure all were satisfied as a result. You know these guys have to be having a ton of fun because with the sheer amount of talent involved, they can't be making too much money. Now with the addition of Pacino, who plays himself again like most films he has done in the past couple decades; Ellen Barkin, a tad over the top, but then she was drugged for most of it; David Paymer, in a funny bit part/running joke; and Eddie Izzard, somewhat underused here; the multitude of characters can be a bit overwhelming.Overall it all worked for me. The plot twists are never too out there that you shake your head, many times you actually smile thinking that that was how it would be anyways. The filmmakers don't go out to confuse you, they just tell it how it has to happen and let the pieces fall into place. All the acting ends up being real good, maybe due in part to everyone having shortened time to not risk screwing up. My favorite is still the sarcastic banter and education void between Casey Affleck and Scott Caan. These two really have a great rapport with each other and every line out of their mouths is hilarious. Just watching them running through the halls of the casino when they have multiple tasks to accomplish made me laugh out loud.",7,1,2,18 June 2007
Empire of the Sun," Like God taking a photographEmpire of the Sun
","Empire of the Sun is definitely a Steven Spielberg film. It has the epic scenery and action, the sentimental underlying tale of survival, and tragedy made the best of. Sure, like all Spielberg films, this one has the eventual happy ending, however, it really can be taken many ways. Most of his recent films have gone too far into the area of sap and/or ending happier than one would expect the context of the film to have gone tosee AI, Minority Report, and Catch me if You Can. Thankfully, like he went back to with Munich last year, Empire of the Sun has a conclusion that fits it perfectly, a mix of melancholy and hope for the future that never forgets the arduous path taken to finally get back home.Looking at the star Hollywood players today, you see Christian Bale as a chameleon that is the best leading man character actor out there. With the kind of history the film industry has, in that child stars never end up doing anything career-wise later on, it is amazing to see how good Bale was even as a kid. There is such a control over his facial expressions and emotions that you can't believe he is only 13 years old here. The internal workings and intelligence is there, as well as that infectious smile which lights up his face, the guy has not changed one bit. A couple times I actually thought he might go Patrick Bateman on someone or retort back, 'don't you know I'm Batman?' Bale carries this film completely as Jim, not only because it is his story of becoming a man during a time of war, where his aristocratic upbringing literally saves his life a few times, but because he outperforms the pros and entraps you fully into the tale on screen.During his journey through China, trying to stay alive amongst the Japanese troops and the other POWs of both British and American nationalism, he comes across a wonderful cast of characters. You have the great performances from Nigel Havers as the prison camp doctor and Miranda Richardson as a sickly British upper class woman, as the father and mother figures in Jim's life. Havers had seen to it to help keep up the boy's education and Richardson has given him a home with her husband and someone to care for him when everyone else really just looked after themselves. Another major role came from the great John Malkovich, playing the kind of character he does bestBasie, a man who survives and whose intelligence is higher than his social standing yet helps him keep his life of 'crime' successful. Malkovich definitely is a friend to Jim, but one who will never sacrifice his own wellbeing for the boy. He keeps close to the child when it is needed and has no trouble severing ties when necessary. It is a great showing of character development when Jim realizes who it was that really cared for him, staying with Richardson at the end instead of going to the next camp and finally being able to stand up to Basie. Notice must also be made for Takatoro Kataoka as the young kamikaze pilot. His relationship with Bale across the prison camp's barbwire fence showed a glimpse into humanity and the breaking of barriers that can happen when politics are thrown out. Theirs was a truly bonding friendship amongst the carnage and a nice contrast to it. I also can't finish speaking about the cast without mention of a very young Ben Stiller; talk about an amusing surprise in a bit role at the start of his career.Empire of the Sun reminded me of what Spielberg is capable of doing with the medium. Along with Saving Private Ryan, Schindler's List, and Munich, among others, he can really tell an emotional story that lends itself well to the historical context of what is happening in its environment. Yes, this is a story about the ruthlessness of the Japanese in China during WWII, but it is also a tale of a boy's survival by use of his kind heart, proper manners, and stunning smarts. While knowing what to do in situations by way of living in China his entire life, he is able to help those around him, but never seems unnatural as he delivers his advice like that of a child, almost as a game in many instances. He speaks a mile a minute and continues his life of making friends with everyone and never taking a break. The moment in which we find out why, when the doctor tells Jim to stop thinking for once and we finally get to see the emotion flow from him completely uninhibited, it is truly heartbreaking and at the same time a joy to see because that is exactly how a child in the same situation would have reacted. Phenomenal job all around and I really hope Spielberg has a few more of these left up his sleeve.",Null,0,2,4 February 2007
The Devil Wears Prada," I'm sure you have plenty more poly-blend where that came fromThe Devil Wears Prada
","I guess this is the sign of what America likes to read, being that The Devil Wears Prada was based off of a best-seller. People must enjoy their books light and fluffy, convenient and contrived. Well, it doesn't really surprise me, as most of America likes the escapism and ability to spend time with something that doesn't take too much brainpower to follow. Now, I could be totally off base here, but if I am, it doesn't excuse the fact that the movie adaptation is all the things mentioned above. Also, from experience, I know Americans definitely like their movies as low maintenance as possible, so it is no surprise this film did so well. It is a shame though, because there are some nice performances and some moments that truly work, too bad there were also many that did not.We have the fish-out-of-water tale of a young girl getting a job with the country's most esteemed and vicious fashion critics. Now I understand she was hired because the critic wanted to prove a point with her old assistant, but come on, there is no possible way this girl with no fashion sense and a bit of an attitude against authority could be hired for the job. However, sometimes it is good to have someone on board with a fresh look, so I can suspend disbelief here. Our girl slowly grows into her job, neglects the people that mean the most to her, and begins a journey down the path of a cutthroat career girl doing what is necessary to get ahead. Of course we will be given the obligatory 'a-ha' moment where she sees what has gone wrong with her life and how she has changed those around her for the better, but even with that knowledge, I still wanted to enjoy what I was watching. I wanted to have fun with the ride no matter how easy the plot was progressing and how obvious. Unfortunately the characters didn't keep up appearances and some moments were just laughable at how specifically simplistic they were.Give credit to Anne Hathaway for actually giving us what we expect from her role. It is pretty much a rehash of the exact same part from Princess Diaries, but hey, she does the ugly duckling to gorgeous success well. How Hollywood can continue to get away with casting an attractive girl in these cases and call them fat before the transformation, I have no idea. As for the rest of the cast, the real standout comes from Stanley Tucci who steals absolutely every second of screen time he has. The guy makes anything he is in better and no matter how bad the role, he finds a way to redeem it. As far as writing goes, he is given all the great one-liners and nails each and every one, (whether I should applaud the author or screenwriter, I don't know).Our other two leads, Emily Blunt and Meryl Streep, just did not work for me. I have heard all this great press for Blunt and how her breakthrough performance was top-notch. In my opinion, her character was underdeveloped and a pawn used for the sole purpose to help show Hathaway's rise up the ranks. When the tug of war is no longer needed, she completely disappears from the film because she wasn't needed for anything else. I'm not saying she was bad, I'm just saying the part was a throwaway one. Benecio Del Toro's small role in Swimming With Sharks was more fleshed out and it lasted maybe five minutes, (Sharks, by the way, is a similar talea lot darker and sadisticand much, much better). As for Meryl Streep, what can you say about the acting? The sweet monotone voice while she is turning the knife in the back of all those around her is spot-on, but again, the role just doesn't live up to the evilness necessary and expected. Until her final revelation of espionage, she really wasn't all that bad. Nobody really hated her, Tucci and Blunt continuously defended her and even Hathaway spoke about how she was just real good at her job, and if she were a man, no one would say a thing. Where was this monster I wanted to see?Now, when it comes to contrivances, you don't have to look far. A friend is trying to make a name for herself in the art world and Hathaway's lust-interest just happens to be there to show the burgeoning love triangle? I don't want to give anything away, but could the car crash have been any better timed as far as tough decisions go? What could have been a nice confrontation between assistants ends up taking place in a hospital without any of the fireworks that would have happened in real life. Also, how about Hathaway always meeting the precisely right person needed at every party/event? If there is a problem for her to solve, she just happened to have been introduced to the person that can solve it five minutes before. It was all just too easy; I couldn't stay bought in for too long before I was jarred back into the reality of it all. I will say, though, that the ending moments were well done and worked in the grand scheme of things. Through everything, the job did make a difference in our lead's life, and the quick moments with Streep and Blunt at the conclusion were nice to see.",5,0,0,29 July 2007
Gone Baby Gone," Be wise as a serpent and innocent as a doveGone Baby Gone
","Real life is not known for its happy endings. Author Dennis Lehane seems to understand this fact and is not afraid to tell his stories with that mentality. The last novel of his to be given the film treatment was Mystic River. A great movie from Clint Eastwood was the result, showing the deep bonds between family and friends in Boston amidst horrifying tragedy. While the story and acting were top-notch there, something about the recent adaptation of Gone Baby Gone takes it a step further. It is my guess that the impetus for this is adapter/director Ben Affleck. While I'm sure Lehane keeps his stories seeped in Boston lifeblood, the transition to screen can't always be exact, it takes a filmmaker from there to get it correct. As a directorial debut, you can't ask for more from Affleck. No matter what your feelings are about his acting skills (I'm a fan, mainly due to his comedic work) you cannot deny the talent behind the camera. He brings authenticity to the relationships on screen as well as being unafraid to show Boston as it is. The film is as much about the search for a missing girl as it is a lesson on what family means to those living in the city.For being a character-based tale, Affleck has allowed the story to hold itself up as the enthralling thriller it is. While there is a more action-oriented scene in the middle, it is the suspense of the unknowing that keeps us enraptured in the proceedings. Casey Affleck is a courageous take-no-crap from anyone hero inside a somewhat diminutive frame as compared to some of the heavies he comes across. He is a man who shows what he is made of on many occasions, including at a bar early on questioning witnesses, talking to the drug lord Cheese, and springing to action when his friends attempt a siege alone on a house later in the film. He's the Catholic Boston boy, raised on the streets along with those who took the other road to violence and crime. With a strict moral code, established in large part by his priest growing up, he is unable to accept the skewed mentality of those around him who allow themselves to do wrong as long as it gets a wrongdoer off the streets.Ben's use of the camera is great. He portrays Boston by the people that inhabit it. The little touches of montages showing real citizens on their bar stools and street corners help put everything in context. Then you have the grass roots word of mouth crusades going on to express how no matter what part of society you belong to, the community takes care of its own. From the bar regular that spills what he knows about the missing girl, (putting up flyers about her as she was their unofficial mascot being that the mother frequently brought her inside), to the other that yells at him to keep his mouth shut, (its one thing to lie to the cops, but another to tell the truth to someone you knowa reason Casey's character is enlisted to help gather intelligence), to the police officer at a funeral for a fallen cop walking up and congratulating Casey for a job well done killing a known pedophile, these people respect the protection of their own no matter what ugliness was used to get it. This is an underlying theme in Mystic River too, but something about this cast and the lead and director being from the city itself that rings so much more true. Besides that authenticity, Affleck does a nice job at adding his own flair to the proceedings and a superb eye for composition of frame and use of close-ups during character interaction. I can't wait to see what he does next.One must commend him also for his ability to get phenomenal performances from his cast. Many actors say that actors turned director get the most from them, and it shows here. Between this and Jesse James, it will be a crime if Casey Affleck is not recognized for his superior work this year. I can't think of anyone who has done a better job than him. The latent bad boy hiding behind his good exterior and moral disposition comes out to great effect, helping to show the interior conflict he battles through the story. Everyone else is fantastic too, but special mention needs to be made for some. Titus Welliver, (wonderful in Deadwood, it's good to see him doing films), stands out as the uncle of the missing girl hiding a few secrets himself, and the consummate professional Ed Harris bringing his A-game. Harris is a complicated man here with many hidden motivations. His role is very integral to the film and the way he can turn on the tough guy persona when necessary and the compassionate friend doing what he can to help another assuage his guilt is unmatched. The girl's mother, played by Amy Ryan, also sticks out for her genuine performance. You'd be hard-pressed to believe that she isn't a drug addicted drunk in real life, turning on the tears when appropriate, only to shut the faucet when life goes back to normal.While the journey is amazing, it is the ending that brings everything together. Our lead faces a dilemma that can cost him everything he holds dear. Does he make the right decision? That's for you as the viewer to decide. The final frame is lingered on to allow us time to wonder what would have happened if he chose the other option, but one can't live with regret, they must do what they must do. All those involved saw something in this story and they all honored it with their best, making this my new favorite of the year, by a long shot.",10,9,18,20 October 2007
The Bourne Ultimatum," He just drove off the roofThe Bourne Ultimatum
","I have never been one to shy away from saying that most action films just plain do nothing for me. Most times they are blatant vehicles to blow stuff up, show off sexy models, and throw any semblance of reality or intelligence out the window. With that said, the Bourne series has been fantastic. Doug Liman ushered in a new take on action by using a more cinema verite style, showing the fights in full force and making our super spy someone we can relate to emotionally as well as humanly. This is not the sci-fi absurdity that was Bond (before they did an overhaul in the style of this series no less). There was a lot to worry for when the Bourne Supremacy came out. With director Paul Greengrass taking over, what could have been a second-hand copy of the original ended up being an improvement in style and flair. The stakes were raised and the story was enhanced because of it. Greengrass needs to be given a ton of credit for being able to keep up appearances with the latest installment, The Bourne Ultimatum. In what is an amazing conclusion to a top-notch trilogy, the action is brought to a new level and story and performance are never compromised.Once again, Bourne is brought into the minds of the CIA by false pretenses. Someone has leaked information about the Treadstone upgrade called Blackbriar and once Bourne is located trying to converse with the newswriter who broke the story, he is assumed to be the mole. Only Pamela Landy, she who was on the case to find him in Supremacy, knows that he can't be the one. Bourne's motive has always been to stay clear of the government and live his life in peace. It has been the CIA who keeps bringing him back into the open to wreak havoc on them. What ends up transpiring is that Bourne wants to know the source as well to finally find out the truth of who he is and what made him into a killer. The film, then, becomes a chase against time and each other to find the source and see if the government can close the breach and tie off all loose ends, or if Bourne can get his revenge on those who took his life from him.In what is probably the simplest storyline of the series, with only one chase lasting the entirety of the story, it has possibly the biggest cast of characters and turning over of loyalties to expose the corruption that has been behind the full story progression. This is not a detriment at all, however, as it allows for more fights and car chases that work in full context to the plot. Admission to this film is worth it for the apartment fight, between Bourne and the CIA's second asset, alone. The chase jumping through windows in Madrid is cool on its own, but when they finally meet up, we get a ten minute or so fight that is as invigorating to watch as any scene you'll see. Also, rather than using a massive car chase as a climatic set piece like in the first two films, we instead get around three small scale road races, just as intense, but staggered enough to never bog the action down into monotony.After five years of waiting, we also find out the origin of our favorite operative with heart and feeling. By the end of the film we will find out what has been the cause of all the espionage and destruction that has taken place around him. No one could have done it better than Matt Damon. He has the physique and attitude to be believable in the action sequences, but also the range to pull off the moments of intelligence and cat and mouse correspondence with those against him. Joan Allen reprises her role with the same amount of dedication to her job, but also a bit more disenchantment for what is going on around her after how Brian Cox's character, from the first two films, took matters into his own hands. Needing a role in that mold, we are given a nice turn from David Strathairn. Like Cox, he is working at the top of the food chain and answers to no one when making a decision. With as much trying to cover up any connections to his bosses of the Blackbriar program as he is trying to do his duty to his country, you can never quite gauge what he will be capable of doing. Even the little guys do a wonderful job, like Paddy Considine as the reporter who starts the leak at the center of everything, Albert Finney as a man from Bourne's past and possibly key to his origin, and Edgar Ramirez as one of the CIA's operatives sent to take Bourne out. Ramirez is a nice addition to the role that has been successfully played by Clive Owen (Identity), Karl Urban, and Martin Csokas (Supremacy). He doesn't talk much, if at all, but he has the look and robotic efficiency down pat and hopefully will get more roles to show what he can do post a nice turn in Domino.In the end, one has to applaud Paul Greengrass for continuing to exceed expectations and bring this series to a conclusion that builds on the success of its predecessors rather than destroy them. His skill at the close-up hand-held look is astonishing and has the same kinetic energy as Tony Scott, but without quite the seizure-inducing cuts. Rather than feel like over- production, his use of hand-held enhances the environment and puts you directly into the action. Let's also credit cinematographer Oliver Wood, who shot all three Bourne films. He was able to work with both directors and work his style into a nice harmony with them.",8,206,279,4 August 2007
Burn After Reading," His optometrist has a sense of humorBurn After Reading
","Last year's No Country for Old Men showed the world that the Coen brothers could make a great film. After a pair of not-so-good flicks, no one really cared about them, two creative geniuses that crafted some of cinema's best black comedies of the 80s and 90s. Then came the Oscar winner, showing an attention to detail and precision pacing worthy of the accolades if not, in my opinion, the best film of the year. But it was so serious and unlike anything they had ever done; yes it had some very subtle laughs, however, it was a drama from start to finish. So, when the trailers for Burn After Reading hit the airwaves, I wasn't quite sure what I would get. It looked as though the Coens of yesteryear were truly back, mixing their quirky brand of wit with an underlying plot dealing with crime and blackmail. Did those thoughts come to fruition? You bet they did. This ranks with Miller's Crossing and Fargo as one of their best dark comedies. The runtime may drag a bit at times, but I think that may actually enhance the humor, feigning suspense and hitting us over the head with laughter.It's a very smart script with some really fantastic performances, many of which are somewhat against type for the actor. Richard Jenkins is possibly the most obvious, playing a gym manager with no backbone whatsoever. He exudes fear, curling up into a ball when the slightest inclination of danger rears its head; a definite departure for someone used to playing strong, intelligent men. There is also Brad Pitt as a gym employee and co-mastermind behind the insane blackmail plot that the film revolves around. The filmmakers do nothing to make him look any younger than his actual age, and yet they have him act as though he is a child. Constantly dancing and jumping and being absolutely giddy with excitement, he is a little boy doing rather than thinking. The little things like complaining when he must wear a suit, or his juvenile disappointment when his reward demands go unresolved, or even his contemptuous, pompous laugh when his bike is demeaned'You think that's a Schwinn?'only makes the role funnier because Pitt is almost always the calm collected one in films.Then there is George Clooney, who actually carries the film, something you wouldn't think from the trailers. When the credits began and he was first billed, I was a tad confused. I had thought he would be a small role compared to the trio of Pitt, Frances McDormand, and John Malkovich when in fact he is the common factor linking them all. Clooney is a mess of nerves, constantly paranoid, a security Marshall in the treasury department who seemingly does no work. If the CIA operatives that we cut to every now and then didn't mention his job, I would have believed he made it upthe guy just walks around with his gun, (never fired in 20 years on the jobhmmm, that's not a bit of foreshadowing is it?), has relations with multiple women, and spends his time welding something very intriguing in his basement. Watching him off-kilter and not fully composed is a welcome change of pace in his canon of work, while being par for the course here as no one really has it all together.It is the slight imbecility of each character that allows the story to push forward. As J.K. Simmons' CIA Chief constantly agrees with, everyone is confused about what's going on. These people are all out of their leagues, causing unnecessary trouble, bringing the Russians into the fold, and leaving dead bodies. One of the best lines is when he utters, 'well we learned something here, not to do that again  whatever it was we did.' Everything happens due to the random forgetfulness of a divorce lawyer's secretary. She accidentally leaves a disc at the gym containing the memoirs of her boss's client's husband, a former CIA analyst (Malkovich in a nicely dangerous and angry role). The utter stupidity of the morons working at Hardbodies cause a chain reaction that unravels the lies and deceit running rampant through everyone's sordid and sad lives. They are all self-absorbed in their own pursuits of happiness that everything becomes excellent fodder for intelligent comedy, not needing to rely on physical humor. Although those few instances of it, Malkovich punching Pitt for one, do succeed.To speak about the multiple intertwining of players would ruin some of the surprises that occur, but let's just say everyone ends up meeting the others at some point, either face to face or by reputation. A comedy of errors, the lack of smarts for most roles rivals that in Raising Arizona, but the plot here is so much more detailed. There are some surprises, Clooney's invention and of course his encounter with Pitt, but mostly it is the waiting to see how far the farce will go that keeps you in the seat. We as the audience know that it all depends on a disc with unimportant information, so the real fun comes from seeing if everyone in the film will realize it as well. David Rasche and Simmons' brief interludes, (I really love the CIA scenes with the echoing footsteps and stark white walls), are the glue that keeps everything sane. Those two trying to wrap their heads around what is happening may be read into as a commentary on the stupidity of our government, but to me, because they just can't fathom what is going on around themnot because they don't know the details, they just can't comprehend the ultimate goalit is more a comment on how stupid civilians are. Trying to grab cash anyway they can, people will do anything, especially things without any sound judgment at all.",8,1,4,20 September 2008
Watchmen," The end is nigh  Watchmen
","After twenty years the ultimate graphic novel, a tale many hold to be amongst the greatest stories ever written, illustrated or not, has finally been brought to cinematic life. Warner Bros. needs to be given a lot of credit for taking the chance, rolling the dice, and ultimately paying the price (Fox sucks) to allow it all to be told on screen as it should. With Zack Snyder at the helm and co-creator Dave Gibbons along for the ride, Watchmen becomes a visceral assault on our sensibilities, our morals, and our existence in just the same way the novel did with its dark and cynically written prose. Yes, there are changes, in both the details and the big events, but in the end it all comes down to the same question. What is an acceptable price to be paid for the continuation of humanity? It's a question that one hopes will never be alive to watch the results of, but in a time of aggression, paranoia, and fearnot knowing whether the enemy would strike first, but always ready to strike backwhere oblivion was an inevitability, it begs for an answer, no matter how atrocious the truth may be.The beauty of the novel lies in the details. With immense scope and mythology, each character was given a complete history, an origin to the man or woman each became. Snyder and company don't turn their backs on this fact, allowing the film to proceed with its disjointed narrative, going back and forth between the present and the past that came before. We catch glimpses of how each evolved into the people they've become, whether that be even more invested in his convictions, (Rorschach), living a lie that the best times of her life were forced upon her by a mother who's limelight was fading, (Silk Spectre), lazy and out of shape from the fear that replaced the confidence when the costume was shut away in the basement, (Nite Owl II), or a self-made millionaire with a grip on business and government, (Ozymandias). Everything shown leads up to the climax in which each member of Watchmen rejoin with the fate of the world on the table and the impossible choice to either be made or stopped.Unfortunately, the cinematic version is flawed because of the exact same issue. With so much detail and intricacy of plot and characterization, something has to be left on the cutting room floor. Personally, I believe the filmmakers made the perfect maneuvers to solve the problem of overkill. However, for someone to come in, without any knowledge of the story they are about to experience, it can be very daunting, very inaccessible, and ultimately unworthy of their time. What becomes a masterpiece of tone and literary adaptation for those familiar with the mythology ends up just a boring, bloated, action-less superhero saga that causes more laughter and headshaking then fervor or intrigue. As a result, Watchmen is more of a companion piece to the novel, something to view in conjunction with what is one of American literature's finest works.But enough of that small point of contention; there is just too much more to love. You cannot deny the sheer brilliance of the special effects work, from the glowing blue body of Manhattan to the flying Archie to the beauty of Mars. The fight choreography is superb, just the right mix of sharp cuts and extended sequences to show the actual hits and not just the contact. Action fans will not be disappointed with the quality here, just the quantity. And as for direction, Snyder uses the novel as a guideline/storyboard pre-destined for the Cineplex, breathing life into the two-dimensional page. So much is almost exact to Gibbons' drawings and so much is crammed into every frame. Just watching the opening credit sequence shows the care for detail that was taken, showing so much to make the fan cry for joy and the newcomer scratch his head in confusion. I don't even fault the decision to alter the ending, allowing the climax to be more relevant for the real world yet still maintaining the same ultimate end. To stick to the book here would have alienated even more people into dismissing the story as a misguided farce rather then the biting political/social commentary it is.The one thing I believe everyone can appreciate, though, is the stellar cast. With Malin Akerman being the only weak link, (sorry my dear, you look the part, but just don't quite have the acting chops yet to pull it off), there is little left to be desired. Billy Crudup's passive monotone is exactly what you'd imagine from Manhattan, Matthew Goode's affluent inflection and precise delivery of his words just the right amount of ego and genius Ozymandias contains, and Patrick Wilson's bumbling loner-geek brings Dan Dreiberg to life, showing all the insecurities that vanish when inside the Nite Owl suit. Where the true brilliance lies, however, is with Jeffrey Dean Morgan's Comedian and Jackie Earle Haley's Rorschach. Morgan's unceasing grin and amorality shows both the loathsome nature of his existence as well as the ultimate mirror showing the world its true face of greed, corruption, and selfishness. He truly is the embodiment of the American Dream. And Haley's Rorschach becomes our entry-point and guide to the tale. His skewed sense of reality and justice makes him a villain, a murdering criminal, yet you can't help but wish you could have his conviction and fearlessness to do whatever it takes. The ultimate badass, his Walter Kovacs might be the most flawed role of the bunch, but that just makes him even more likable and relatable because, in the end, we are all flawed creatures pretending to be righteous and good.",9,6,15,2 March 2009
28 Weeks Later," Code Red28 Weeks Later
","This was definitely a film that I didn't see any necessity for. 28 Days Later was a fantastic genre film whose main success was not really being the film people expected it to be. What worked there was that we were able to wake up into the world just as our main character did. We experience the disorientation and the horror right along with him, as well as the humanity still within him having missed the original outbreakunlike the disheartened and beaten comrades he meets along the way. When we enter the quarantined world of England, now seven months past infection, we see a country trying to rebuild, all the infected dead of starvation. It is inevitable that there will be some way in which the virus is released again, or else we would have no movie. The real question is, then, will the film work when we already know what will happen? I wasn't quite sure because we had exhausted the running for freedom motif with the first one, however, the filmmakers sure do surprise. What 28 Weeks Later may lack in originality and story depth, it more than makes up with suspense, emotion, and non-stop action.The original film was new and different because it wasn't about fighting the undead, but about surviving against mankind's brutality. Its one flaw was that it got away from this a bit towards the end as Cillian Murphy went on a one man killing spree, yet it worked because he was killing men and not infected beings. I expected this film to be that ending for two hours, but instead, it actually stayed consistent with the running and surviving. Whereas the first needed that shift in order to get its storied point across, this one already had it as a backdrop. Our only story here is trying to get two kids, who may hold a cure to the virus, out of England in the midst of total extermination. Therefore, the story needs the chase, and the film delivers to its utmost.Our opening scene, showing how Robert Carlyle loses his wife and stays alive to eventually reunite with his children sent away on a school trip, puts us right into the action. The jerky camera style remains, showing us the brutality without the graphic details. These people care for each other and there is as much fear on their faces as there is sorrow and helplessness in being unable to help. It is a great entry into a story that soon slows down a bit to catch us up with what has happened in the weeks since our last visit. Repopulation has begun and Carlyle's children have finally been allowed back in. Their reunion is short-lived on the happiness factor with him explaining how their mother died, and soon the children set off into forbidden territory to find a photo of her before the youngest forgets her face. To everyone's surprise, the children find their mother at the house, infected but not raging. The military take all back into District 1 and we soon have chaos back in action.What occurs as a result of the re-infection of society is a mass extermination by the hands of the US army overseeing the reopening of England. They have failed and must cover their tracks so the virus can't leave the island for mainland. Caught inside, though, are the two children, played effectively by Imogen Poots and Mackintosh Muggleton, an army doctor, (a favorite of mine, Rose Byrne), trying to keep them alive because a cure might be inside their blood, and a sniper who could no longer handle killing innocents, (Jeremy Renner doing a great job). It is their race to keep alive that drives the final three quarters of the film and it never gets tiring. With the infected and the military on their tails, attempting to do them in, only Harold Perrineau's pilot can get them off the island.Director Juan Carlos Fresnadillo does an admirable job in keeping the same tone and aesthetic as his predecessor. I have to believe that Danny Boyle staying on as producer helped keep the two films as consistent as possible. 28 Weeks Later never falls back on jump out of your seat moments and never takes the easy way out. The utter destruction of England at the hands of those trying to salvage it is a sight to behold and the death count of characters that you would think were untouchable, is astounding. You cannot blink once because you really have no idea what may be coming, and the brilliant industrial score keeps tension high throughout. Unfortunately, though, the filmmakers didn't quite trust their audience as they spell out what happens at the end in a short epilogue, possibly trying to segue into a third part. What could have been an ominous final shot of our young hero gets subverted by the unnecessary showing of what transpires as the survivors leave the island for France.Rarely do sequels live up to their predecessors, especially those that probably never need to be made. Much like Aliens and Underworld: Evolution live up to their originals, by upping the action and suspense in a story without the depth needed for a part one, 28 Weeks Later holds its own with Days. To sum it all up, if you enjoyed Boyle's vision of horror you will not be disappointed at how the story continues.",8,6,12,15 May 2007
21," Did that dazzle you?21
","I wasn't averse to checking out this new film. That is until I started hearing all the bad press going around the circuit. So, with low expectations I finally took the opportunity to try it out and while there are definite problems, 21 is not too bad. Obvious and generic as far as story structure goes with a concept well known in America about beating the game of Blackjack, my main gripes were with the small stuff. What I found really working was the fun/entertainment factor. Even though I could guess how it would all turn out, the ride was a joy to partake in.We have our genius student who did everything right throughout his school career to get into Harvard Medical. What does this kid have to complain about, besides maybe the lack of a stimulating social life? Well how about the $300,000 tuition necessary to actually attend the school itself. Thankfully for Ben, an opportunity presents itself very early on in the application process, for a full scholarship, that could solve all his troubles. A whiz at numbers and pretty much everything to do with analytical thinking, Professor Rosa sees a younger version of himself in Ben, the perfect choice to lead his team of card counters in wiping Vegas clean. Not only does this proposition play on Ben's need for money, but it also gives him an excuse to get away from the dweeby friends and drab school life. Las Vegas was calling and he was ready to live for the first time in his life. I mean, without any consequencescounting cards is not illegalwhat did he have to lose? It turns out everything. I'm sure if you've seen the trailers at all you understand the magnitude of what happens in the 'backrooms' of casinos, the place where those on the payroll inflict their own sort of justice. The thing about this film is that the moment when they experience what truly happens isn't until pretty much the end. We are allowed a nice exposition of how the team nurtures their new point-guard and gets him game ready. The relationships formed become stronger, the takes become bigger, and the theatrics more brazen. There is some nice movement in the shooting style, low angles, extreme close-ups of the signals, and nicely choreographed sequences with the cards flipping, giving a cursory introduction to the system being utilized. I really liked this aspect because it allowed me as the viewer to get a handle on what was going on. At first I was bored, hoping movie magic would gloss over the lesson, but in the end I am thankful for having watched it. All the process jargon is tempered with more humanistic moments to keep us grounded in the story too. Ben and Jill's friendship evolves; Ben begins to distance himself from the only two friends he had before his recruitment; Ben and ex-top dog on the team Fisher butt heads; and 'eye-in-the-sky' Cole Williams watches everything from behind the scenes, looking for a huge bust in order to save his job from being replaced by computer facial recognition software.It's all by the books, our hero faces the challenge of stepping out of the villain's shadow and then giving a little pain back himself. We watch to see how it all turns out, no matter how obvious it will be. The scholarship meeting bookmarks help frame the story nicely, showing what it was all for$300,000 and he was out; sometimes it's not that easy. And because of that fact, the cast needed to be a good mix of personalities, all who could pass for geniuses and miscreants. Jim Sturgess has the exact unassuming charm needed to pull off the transformation from bookworm 4.0 student to the high-rolling playboy Ben becomes. He has an everyman quality about him perfect for us to put ourselves in his shoes and think whether we would have been able to resist temptation. The rest of the team is great as well with Aaron Yoo and Liza Lapira adding some humor, Jacob Pitts showing what fame and jealousy can do to your soul if not held in check, Kate Bosworth is solid as the love interest, and Josh Gad exudes soon to be millionaire dork with grace. The real surprise had to be Kevin Spacey though. I would have thought he'd chew as much scenery as possible and while he does overpower at times, the humor he portrays as a quick-witted professor and the glee when he gets to Vegas in the middle of the action really rings true for Rosa, as well as the serious times when his darkside comes out.Besides the generic Hollywood quality on display, the small things are what bugged me. Should they have as much as they did? Probably not, but nonetheless they nagged at me the entire time. One is Sturgess' bad American accent. It is weird because when he plays the role, it's hardly noticeable; however, during every instance of voice-over narration, it was as if he was reciting dictation in a class where he was learning to hide the British. Another example is in the casting of Ben's friends. These guys are the epitome of geek and yet they are with Sturgess, a guy that can pass for geek if necessary, sure, but do they have to stick him with these two guys? The juxtaposition is so broad that it just stuck out like a sore thumb. Sometimes bashing the audience over the head isn't the best way to go about your business. Otherwise, a good effort for a brainless popcorn flick. One could do a lot worse.",6,1,1,8 June 2008
American Psycho," I was returning some videotapesAmerican Psycho
","Oh, the 1980's, such happy times. Excess in full force, younger upstart yuppies making money that they could only imagine as children while doing as little work as possible. When did going to lunch, out to dinner at restaurants booked for months in advance, and vying for the biggest ego constitute an occupation worth six figures? Only in America. Bret Easton Ellis' novel was looked upon as very demeaning to women in its portrayal of these masochistic males using their girls as trophies and toys, so who better to adapt and direct a feature of American Psycho than a woman such as Mary Harron. Her film version is a satire on society's fall to materialism and conformity, showing how along with the money and power comes a way of life that is unavoidable. Our lead, Patrick Bateman at one point tells his girlfriend that he is trying to fit in. He is catering to the image of masculinity and success despite his urges to break free into his own lifestyle of gratuitous sex and violence. He says early on that Patrick Bateman doesn't exist, he is an empty face hiding the darkness underneath, the scheming and desire to live on the fringe of society and be able to get away with it amongst the self-absorbed snobs running around blind to anything but themselves.The story hinges on the devolution of humanity for Bateman as the vapid existence he lives becomes too much to handle. Everything in his world is superficial, from his girlfriend, to his lithium-using mistress, to his meaningless job and his need to look and live better than his peers. One of the best scenes comes from a comparison of business cards and whose is more subtly beautiful due to the whiteness of stock and uniqueness of font. Each card is identical to the layperson, but to these men, obsessed with appearances, they couldn't be more different and inferior. It is such a cookie-cutter lifestyle that no one even knows whom each other is. They will call 'friends' by the wrong name and then proceed to talk about how much of a reject the person they are actually speaking to is, unknowing they are insulting them to their face. It is one thing to allow the mistakes to happen, it's another to revel in it and pretend to be that other person, because really, what is the difference? Both wear the same suits, have an affinity for the same glasses, and get their hair cut at the same salon.Because of this duality in identity, Bateman is given a carte blanche to live out his dark fantasies at night. If people think he is someone else when he is raping and murdering people, he is able to live without risk of being caught. Heck, he doesn't even need an alibi because his friends are 100% positive he was out with them the night he was committing heinous crimes. Between the drugs and carbon copy personas, no one knows who they are let alone who they are with. Therefore, Bateman can do whatever he wants, and does. He lives in his own world, waxing pontifically about asinine drivel before going in for the kill.I don't think anyone could have pulled this role off besides Christian Bale. His demeanor is so likable that no one would think twice about feeling safe with him. As a model he meets and later dispatches says, 'there is something good about you.' Even when in rage, he retains his smile and jovial attitude, praising Phil Collins' talent for bringing Genesis out of their arty funk and Whitney Houston for four of the greatest songs ever written on her album appropriately titled Whitney Houston. The way his delivery makes the most benign topics jump out at you is amazing and when the blood splatters onto his face, you can't help but laugh through the carnage. No other film will make you see the humor in serial killing for sport. All Bateman does is what we fantasize about everyday, breaking free from the monotony and acting on our impulses to punish the stupid and the weak. As he tells a homeless man before killing him, 'why don't you get a job?' It's the man's negative attitude and laziness that prevents him from succeeding in life. This is a time of self-pride and preservation, albeit an excess of said pride, that allows everyone to look at themselves as God. Even a diatribe about the troubles in South Africa and the US with poverty comes off as staged and humorous. Not because Bateman feels these subject are more relevant than Sri Lanka, but because he really doesn't care about any of it.Shot beautifully with many static frames focusing on the person's face in action rather than the activity happening around them, American Psycho is gorgeous to behold. The stark sanitation of everything: clean apartments, pristine bodies, and impeccable dressing style counters lovely with the chaos that Bateman brings from his bloodlust.It is Leto's disappearance that lends to the fact of whether what we see actually happens. Did Bateman kill him and continue with his atrocities afterwards or did Leto really go to London, where people had lunch with him, and the murder was just imagination? No one can ever really know since no character ever knows whom it is they are talking to. Perhaps those who saw Leto really saw others who pretended to be him mistakenly, or maybe he was there still alive and breathing. This is the confusion with insanity and chaos, one can't tell the difference between truth and fiction; the line blurs to infinity. American Psycho could be a tale of the psyche or a story of murderous rage left unchecked, it's really up to you to decide.",10,2,5,2 August 2008
Little Miss Sunshine," A little sweet sweetnessLittle Miss Sunshine
","Keeping up with the recent buzz-worthy films coming out of Sundance the past couple years, Little Miss Sunshine is a gem of a movie. After loving crowd favorites Primer (2004) and Hustle and Flow (2005), I wasn't quite sure if the hat trick would be made. Sunshine seemed to have the cast, and direction (the debut of husband/wife team Valerie Faris and Jonathan Dayton, who have helmed some of my favorite music videos including the Smashing Pumpkins' Tonight, Tonight and the Red Hot Chili Peppers' Otherside), but the big question would be if it had the laughs to sustain the quirky indie comedy from not being overwrought and boring. While the film definitely has a couple moments where I was about to be lost, everything ends up happening for a reason; emotions are on a roller coaster ride and the lows always come out with meaning and momentum for the highs. Do yourself a favor and see this sweet, subtle at times and gut-bustingly hilarious at others, perfectly pitched ensemble piece.The co-directors set us up for what is to come in a very nicely designed opening sequence by going character to character, showing us each person in a small vignette of their personalities. This is the quintessential messed-up family with good intentions. Mom and Dad are bickering on how to tell their young daughter about her uncle's attempted suicide, while he sits and stares in a strange melancholy next to the mute, troubled son, (on vow of silence in honor of nihilistic mind Nietzsche), while grandpa spews profanities about the lack of dinner variety. I mean this is the epitome of every family function I've ever been privy to. There is so much a viewer can relate to in each member, allowing for a certain amount of compassion for the views of all involved and seeing that each really does want the best for one another, even if they have a messed up way of showing it.Greg Kinnear and Toni Collette are wonderful as the patriarchs, proving as always that they are probably two of the most under-appreciated actors working today. Very rarely do you get to see them in a starring vehicle, and even though this is an ensemble through and through, they definitely carry it as the driving force. Alan Arkin does his kooky, quasi-angry, sarcastic yelling that he is known for, kind of his role from Edward Scissorhands but r-rated and un- pc. Everything he has done comes to a surprising result at the eponymous beauty pageant for the biggest laughs of the movie, really great stuff subverting the grotesque surrealism surrounding any pageant of this kind. Paul Dano is great as the troubled teen, trying to find a place in the world for himself, and coming to grips with the need for struggle in order to grow as a person, and Abigail Breslin is phenomenal as the happiest girl alive. Once she finds out she has won her regional on default, (those primary school children and their diet pills), she is on cloud nine as the family makes the road trip all for her. She has the acting range of a pro and actually does the Dakota Fanning, but better, as she can act while still being a young child and not an adult in a child's body. Her emotional reactions are spot-on and she has remarkable presence and a self-effacing nature that allows her to be who she is and not be ashamed about it, which is the main purpose of Olive Hoover.The real revelation to take from the antics on screen is a career-role for funnyman Steve Carrell. I've always liked his naïve, teddy-bear persona used to successfully in the Daily Show, The Office, and as the only funny part of Anchorman. Here however, he shows that he has the acting chops to not be pigeonholed and typecast in the over-the-top, lug roles his peer Will Ferrell will never be able to breakout of. Carrell has genuine talent and his suicidal, top Proust scholar in America, uncle is the shining moment of the film. He maintains the dejected quality throughout; even when doing something for the family, doing good, he is always a beaten man. That kind of character is what is needed for all his sharp, dry sarcastic retorts thrown about. He barely outshines the prop of the year, though, the family's yellow VW van. You will not see better prop-gags as the van takes a licking and keeps on ticking although the tick is faint and slowly fading away.Little Miss Sunshine lives up to the strong buzz that surrounds it. It is heartwarming and funny at every turn. There are some dark moments, though, as there are in life. This film is a slice of reality, heightened just the right amount, for all to enjoy. While definitely in the vein of films such as I Heart Huckabees, Thumbsucker, and any Wes Anderson filmit wears its indie cred on its sleeveit is still accessible and hopefully with the drawing power of Carrell will garner an audience that would not otherwise see it.",9,177,270,20 August 2006
Knowing," What about the uncircled numbers?  Knowing
","Thank you Alex Proyas for not making Rose Byrne into Nicolas Cage's love interest for your newest film Knowing. I'll admit, from the trailers, I thought that was exactly what would happen—pretty young woman somehow falling for the crazy-haired one. It is Hollywood, so it wasn't too far-fetched to believe. But that wasn't the only surprise in this sci-fi thriller. No, the biggest one has to be the fact that it was pretty good. For some reason, despite the pretty great early track record for Proyas, I keep getting worried with each new film before being won over by the final result. Sure, this and I, Robot aren't great films, but for genre fare, such as they are, you can do a lot worse.I remember seeing the trailer and thinking Knowing would be your run-of-the-mill prophecy-based plot, proving disaster after disaster until our hero can save the day. Then the second teaser came out showing some creepy, dark-clothed men in the woods—perhaps foreshadowing an intriguing alien aspect to it all. But it is with the poster that truly sets the stage for what is about to happen. Yes, the future predicting is there as the whole basis of the story is upon a two-sided piece of paper with dates, deaths, and coordinates, written by a young girl in 1959 and sealed in a time capsule for fifty years; and yes, don't be surprised to witness a spaceship or alien or two either. However, it is the seemingly misplaced image of the Earth at the center of the one-sheet, appearing to be starting on fire at the bottom that alludes to the apocalyptic theme running rampant throughout. There are just too many mentions of the sun or burning to just push them to the side as coincidence. Especially with a script so heavy in Determinism  Professor John Koestler would be so proud.Speaking of Koestler, at the center of it all is Nic Cage's performance as this MIT astrophysicist. Recently widowed, he is now raising his son alone, allowing his scientific predilections take over his strong religious background. With a pastor as a father and a devote mother and sister, it is Koestler's wife's death that shows him how random and meaningless life is. There is no grand plan; everything is just a sequence of chance chemical reactions, leading more to chaos than any methodical progression. That all changes with the discovery of young Lucinda's cryptic message in the capsule, the lone page devoid of an image of what the future will hold like the rest of the class drew. Her artifact ends up being a literal translation of the future, showing the exact dates and death counts for major disasters around the world. It cannot be a coincidence then that the page found its way into the hands of his son, who subsequently begins to hear whispers like those heard fifty years previous. What is first thought to be a malfunction of his hearing aid, you will soon begin to wonder if those whispers—the jumbled sounds reaching his mind—are the reason he has the aid to begin with.By no means is this thing a masterpiece. Besides the usual hammy performance we have learned to embrace from Cage, (and he was so good in Leaving Las Vegas, I guess they all become caricatures of themselves at some point), we have the very convenient story progressions needed to allow the tale to play out in a reasonable amount of time. The fact that a piece of paper has dates for five decades, yet the final three all happen within a week is a massive coincidence. But, rather than dismiss it as lazy writing, you could chalk it up to one more example of how everything happening is doing so for a reason. Everything, all the good, (marriage, a son), and the bad, (wife's death, a pretty impressive plane crash sequence), put Cage's Koestler on a collision course with his destiny, or at least onto a path in which he can help lead his boy to his. I actually enjoyed his role, for the most part, and for every cringe-worthy instance, there was a genuine showing of emotion. Chandler Canterbury does well as his son, expressing the rebellious nature of a boy his age, questioning his father's motivations and parenting skills, while also lending a mechanical aspect to instill some creepiness. If you want real oddity, though, look no further than Lara Robinson's blank stares as the young Lucinda and later on as her granddaughter Abby. Why have two actresses when you can have one play both in order to keep the familial resemblance in tact? Heck Rose Byrne does the same as Diana, the woman who believes Cage and helps him discover the true meaning of the numbers, as well as Lucinda's adult form in photos.Knowing is a fun ride that ends in a very effective manner: giving me the sad ending that I wanted and hoped the filmmakers didn't copout from doing as well as the happy one giving a sense of hope for the future. As a result, the story itself becomes quite strong with it's lecturing on the subject of fate as well as the allusions to God and creation itself. With some pretty good effects—besides the plane crash carnage, also enjoy the subway derailment, something about people being crushed against high-speed moving glass worked for me—you shouldn't be disappointed if you set out to be entertained by a decent action thriller. If, instead, you wanted an intelligent script that would blow you away in its originality  well, you've come to the wrong movie. Sit back, allow your brain to be stimulated ever so slightly, and just have a good time. I just hope those kids don't eat any apples, because we all know how that ended up the first time.",6,5,9,20 July 2009
The Orphanage," One, two, three, knock on the wallEl Orfanato
","There is something to the marketing of foreign films and the way Hollywood tries its hardest to fool the public into thinking it is an English language movie. By not allowing any characters to speak in the trailers, giving away their secret with subtitles, someone like me, knowing it's foreign, is able to get a glimpse at the style and tone without really learning anything about the plot to ruin my surprise upon sitting in the theatre. This aspect worked perfectly for Guillermo Del Toro's production of El Orfanato. I had very little idea of what I was getting into and this film ended up being the best atmospheric horror I have seen since Alejandro Amenábar's The Others, (I don't count Del Toro's own El Laberinto del fauno because that was more fantasy than anything else). I now ask what it is that all three of these films have in common? With thisJ.A. Bayona's feature debuteach is helmed by a Spanish director. I can't think of a better nation making movies right now; the Spanish are doing everything right and this film just adds to bolstering that argument.Bayona creates a mood and tone that keeps the viewer on the edge of their seats, anticipating the scares that they know will shortly be coming. I was actually surprised how slow the introduction was and how carefully laid out all the story pieces were. We are led into this world, discovering the relationships between our lead roles and the vague past of the orphanage that once housed our heroine and now is about to become her home for special needs children. Like The Others, the spirits involved here are not necessarily violent or demonic. They have an agenda, for sure, but what may at first glance seem malevolent could be nothing of the kind. The orphans now haunting the establishment are only trying to play a game. By taking something you love, a scavenger hunt is begun. Following the clues is the only way the game can end and if successful, the children will grant you one wish. The rules are simple, except the circumstances are far from easily accessible. One must believe that the game can happen before he/she can truly take part. Without the belief that the spirits are in control, success can never be achieved.The cast is led by a remarkable performance from Belén Ruedawho, as it turns out, had a wonderful turn in Amenábar's latest Mar adentro. Her composure and beauty is shattered as she finds her son has been lost. Trying to keep herself together, taking in what the police, her husband, and the mediums enlisted to help on the paranormal aspect tell her, she is given the task to figure out for herself how far she is willing to go to find her son. Always captivating and never out of her element, Rueda carries the story and never looks back. The supporting players around her are all portrayed nicely as well. Fernando Cayo plays the husband watching his wife deteriorate before him while unable to open his mind to the possibility that what she says could be true; Geraldine Chaplin is magnificent as the psychic medium whose trance brings out a puzzle piece necessary to continue the game; and young Roger Príncep plays the child Simón with the right amount of innocence mixed with the knowledge and comprehension of his fate to help keep the bond between he and his mother strong.Bayona never goes for the cheap thrills either as he builds up the tension with sounds and visuals. His use of the closing doors and the moving merry-go-round add a sense of foreboding that ends up being more important than you may initially guess. Stylistically too, the transition between the house's current state of duress with the way it shone by the glow of the adjacent lighthouse from the past is expertly handled. There were numerous instances where the film could have gone off the rails to tragic effect, but he holds it steady throughout. More psychological than visceral, the scares are few, but effective. Even when the grotesque rears its head, it is to enhance the story, not to shock for shock alone. The sound work is utilized to the fullest too. What seems to be jarring and loud for the purpose to scare our lead and us is actually very important to the tale at hand. Nothing is shown or heard here that doesn't have absolute relevance to the film as a whole.The final third of the film comes quick and fully envelopes you into the proceedings. You are right there with Rueda's character as she slowly uncovers the secrets hidden behind the years that have past since she last lived in the orphanage. Whereas a film from Hollywoodof late usually being a remake from a better horror film in Japanwould use this tension in order to hide the flimsy and lackluster conclusion it tacks on so as not to alienate those viewers who enjoy leaving the theatre with a smile, Bayona knows how to effectively end his tale the way it should. I was blown away by the handling of the final scene and the way he used the rules of the game to transition us from one reality to another. It is truly a remarkable feat that hits home hard emotionally, but I will actually say also succeeded in me leaving with a smile on my face. Whether you exit the theatre with your eyes moistened or not, you will not forget the beauty and perfection for which it concludes. The tagline is correct, for while it is a story of horror, it is above all else a tale of love.",9,20,27,12 January 2008
The Shining," A momentary loss of muscular coordinationThe Shining
","How can the pairing of Jack Nicholson and Stanley Kubrick, right after a decade of their best work in the movie industry, fail? With The Shining, we get one of the best thrillers to ever grace the silver screen. There is no need for special effects or gross-out gore like the so- called horror films currently being churned out. Instead we get an amazing lead performance from Nicholson, showing a descent into the hell of insanity, and the visual genius that was Kubrick behind the camera.The best literary adaptations are those that take the source material and make something unique out of it. Film is a totally separate medium and most novels can't be transferred word for word; books just aren't meant to be especially cinematic. With The Shining, we are given something that is no longer Stephen King's story. Sure the crux of the tale remains intact, but a singular mind like Kubrick allows himself to take the basics and craft them into a piece of art that lends itself to the medium being used to express it. Thus, rather than bore us with people talking to explain what is described to us in a booklike The Da Vinci Code amongst otherswe are able to join this family for their winter taking care of the Overlook Hotel. The visuals speak for themselves and it is the inner turmoil and setting in of cabin fever that really takes over the story to become a force in and of itself.There are so many moments and frames of imagery that will stick in your mind for the rest of your life. Between the twin sisters and the sharp cuts to them butchered on the floor, to the blood spilling out from an elevator, to the old woman in room 237, they bring chills just reminiscing. Not to mention the crazy, what the hell just happened moments, like that of the bear and butler alone in their room, whatever evil residing inside the hotel has a keen ability to unsettle and terrorize those that threaten its motives and enjoyment. There could also be no one better to shoot the film then Kubrick and his knack for cinematography and composition. With his visual style, I still can't believe he shot many of his movies in fullscreen format. Having the ability to shoot widescreen seems a natural fit, but something about the 1:1.33 ratio spoke to him. Along with the gorgeous angles and points of view, he orchestrates an amazing score and sound effects track. Being low to the ground as we follow young Danny Torrance on his big wheel not only puts us into the action, but the loud sounds of the wheels turning on the hardwood floor and being momentarily muffled by the area rugs along the way add a sense of foreboding and anxiousness that remains prevalent throughout.Besides the technical craft that went in to the film, we have some stellar acting performances. What can be said about Nicholson's portrayal of Jack Torrance? He always holds that touch of temper hiding behind his too gracious smile at the beginning, and once we hear his wife's tale about why he stopped drinking, you start to realize what he may be capable of. When the voices and visions projected onto him by the hotel finally seep into his head, the real fun begins. His facial expressions, tone of voice, and overall demeanor bring laughs to the audience, but they are just as much for comic reasons as they are for the viewers' unease, smirking out of fear for what this dangerous man might do. The role could have overshadowed everything else, but the success in this film lies in the fact that all fronts work cohesively. Even the abysmal Shelley Duvall doesn't seem too bad here. Her faces of fear are almost too real and her amateurish acting quality lends itself well to the naïve wife dutifully staying by the side of her husband. We are also treated by two wonderful turns from veteran Scatman Crothers and newbie Danny Lloyd. These two experience the titular 'shining' and are able to see what force lies inside the hotel. Almost used as a defensive mechanism to try and exorcise the evil, these two show the good and the bad of their gift. Lloyd is great as the young son experiencing the horrors and visions of past murder; you almost fear for his mental wellbeing. His parents must be credited for allowing their son to partake in such grueling and psychologically detrimental moments. Whether he changes his voice to become Tony or he convulses from what he sees in his head, I have to believe Kubrick shot his scenes in a way to not let him know the full extent of what was happening in the script. Either way, Lloyd has done only one more bit of acting in his life and seems to have called it quits. He still definitely made a lasting impression on the craft.As a final note to the perfection of this movie, it is fun to see how many moments have been used later on in new films. If you are going to steal, definitely steal from the best. A couple I noticed occur during the credit sequence and shortly thereafter. While the titles are fading in we are treated with the Torrance's car riding the mountainous roads to their eventual destination. Although Michael Haneke has put screaming music over his start in Funny Games, the resemblance is uncanny. The other moment that stuck out like a sore thumb was the psychiatric sequence with little Danny. Even with the tone of the scene and the questioning going on about his imaginary friend, it is not until Danny utters in a babyish voice that he doesn't want to talk about it anymore do I recall the similar moment in Donnie Darko pertaining to the rabbit Frank.",10,1,2,26 July 2007
Over the Hedge," Let's call it SteveOver the Hedge
","There are so many animated films coming out a year that it is tough to bring yourself to see any of them. Sure the Pixar brand means instant gold, however, the multitude of studios popping up with computer graphics are really watering down the quality. Especially with every studio releasing the same thing in competition, how many free from the zoo films did we sit through, it is a true surprise when one of these films surprises you. When I first saw the commercials for Dreamworks' Over the Hedge, I had very mixed feelings. I never quite bought the huge hype surrounding the Shrek franchise and Madagascar was a bit of a letdown, so I wasn't sure what to expect here. Although the story isn't anything original, the parallels to Toy Story are very prevalent as well as multiple callbacks to Indiana Jones, Citizen Kane, and A Streetcar Named Desire, etc., the all-star cast and comic relief do make the film a fun ride to sit through.I was a bit surprised at the dark beginning. Before the credits role, (don't get me started here, animated films should not have a prolonged credit sequence, we aren't watching these names act so don't try and sell us by name dropping when we are already seated and watching), there is a confrontation between our reluctant hero RJ and a bear named Vincent. While the quarrel does set up what is to happen, it was a bit edgy compared to the clips I had seen in the trailers. Fortunately, the film doesn't take too long to break the drama and go into the fun atmosphere of our setting, a small patch of green left behind by the suburban sprawl. RJ must recruit the woodland creatures to help him enter his alien world and find food to feed Vincent. Sure we will have the obligatory turning on the leader for the new guy, the antics to get the job done, and the change of heart to save what really matters most in life, but besides the cookie cutter plot line we are treated to some hilarious characters. Bruce Willis does a nice job as RJ the raccoon and has a good rapport with his equal in leadership abilities Verne, voiced by Gary Shandling. These two are the straight men throughout, doing what they can to rally the troops into succeeding at their tasks for the Spring. It's really the periphery roles that steal the show. I generally find Wanda Sykes to be abrasive and annoying, but she reins in her schtick for an effectively bitter skunk in one of the few family-orientated jobs she has done. William Shatner parodies himself as usual, doing the pause ridden speech patterns he is loved for and Eugene Levy is also great as the husband without a backbone, agreeing to whatever seems the right thing to do at the time. The best of all the lemmings, however, is Hammy the squirrel, voiced perfectly by Steve Carrell. Hammy's manic energy does wonders to create big laughs and allows for many of the best gimmicks. His fighting with himself in a mirrored bumper and the hunt to catch the laser pointer's red dot are priceless.A big reason for many of the new animated successes lies with how original the characters involved are, rather than how fresh the story is. Over the Hedge is a perfect example of this, and while a movie like Madagascar fails despite the crazy penguins, this one is a winner as a result of its quirky cast. By allowing ample screen time for the roles that work, one forgets how derivative the tale is because they are so caught up in the antics. Credit the filmmakers for getting the little things right here and not trying to bog down the fun with unnecessary drama. Even the GPS brought laughs as I wish the real ones would restructure their directions when off course by asking for illegal left turns.",7,0,0,24 December 2006
Wanted," Not me, fateWanted
","The trailers for Wanted show how this will be a visceral treat above all else, hopefully containing a great story too, but not necessarily needing one. There is definitely more story than you'd expect from the high action, quick cut trailer, and the performances help keep it grounded in some sense of reality, despite the otherworldly things done by them. Eye-candy for sure, the end result does manage to be more than just the effects, infusing a lot of humor into the action, culminating into a very entertaining experience.The opening sequences definitely set-up what will be expected for the duration. A very stylistically shot film, we are treated to an introduction of Wesley Gibson, our hero, at an office party complete with voice-over narration, changing film speeds, and cuts to events he is thinking of to help illustrate the mental state of ambivalence and docility he has slowly built up to numb himself to the world around him. Juxtaposed with this banal, cubicle life comes a battle scene atop a couple skyscrapers downtown. We have an assassin on the trail of a rogue member of the Fraternity, a group of killers with the ability to hone a massive amount of adrenaline to slow down time and enhance their actions to superhuman levels, looking to identify the bullet being used to out his partners. The fight sprawls into a shootout featuring an impossible leap over a city block through the air, window to window, in order to murder the men across the way, also shooting at him. These men were only decoys, however, as the rogue agent watches it all and finishes the job from miles away. This event begins the search for young Wesley, the son of a Fraternity elite, unknowing of the lion that dwells inside of his beat-down suburbanite façade; a force that will soon come out to play as he discovers his power and a bloodlust for the man that killed his father.Wesley slowly becomes a lethal machine, honing his adrenaline rushes for super sensory ability, the power to bend a bullet through space, and educating himself on the thousand year history of his new brotherhood, learning everything he needs to know to be the best assassin he can be. A guild of weavers to begin, this troupe still keeps up the work in a textile factory using the machinery as tools of training and also as the way to discover who is next on the list to kill. Fate and faith brings the names out through a secret code in the fabric of a giant loom, spelling out who must die next. The world itself deems who is to be taken; a power we can't understand or question makes the decisions because one dead might mean a hundred can continue living. Training with knives, guns, and fists; getting the crap beat out of him until his mind is clear to answer even the simplest questions with complete honesty; and bathing in a concoction of a waxy stimulant that speeds up the healing process by increasing white blood cell count, Wesley quickly becomes the professional he needs to be to take out Cross, the rogue agent that the group says killed his father. Gibson is the only man for the job and the fabric has spoken that Cross' life must be ended.The mythology is very involved and I believe well explained. We learn about the history of the Fraternity, what they do and why, while also getting a feel for the members and where they all come from. Helped immensely by the brilliant special effects, the sequences aren't so much unbelievable as they are just plain slick and cool. The world Bekmambetov has transported us to is such a heightened reality that you begin to accept what occurs for the simple fact that it does. Curving bullets through space, driving cars to flip over another so as to shoot through the sunroof, shooting guns from miles away and hitting the target, and leaping through glass as it slowly shatters are definite feats to behold. One thing this film cannot be faulted for is the flair for which it all happens.To enhance that style is a very prevalent sardonic wit. James McAvoy, who's American accented whine isn't as bad as I feared, is perfectly cast as the lemming breaking free from the constraints he has built around his life. The humor comes through his words and actions, bordering on overkill, (the keys spelling out profanities as he slams a keyboard into another character's face), but never becoming out of place. The aesthetic is set up early and therefore stays faithful throughout. Complete with a well-rounded supporting castKonstantin Khabensky having fun with the director that cast him as the star of his Russian vampire saga, Terence Stamp solid as always in a small role, Angelina Jolie just plain having fun on screen, and Morgan Freeman doing what he does best while also awkwardly yelling out profanities, (for some reason a surreal event), Wanted hits the mark. And Thomas Kretschmann, as Cross, the man being hunted down, is great. There is more to his role than one would initially anticipate and he handles the dramatic needs of the part in concert with the action fights.The film's story takes some very interesting twists and turns that could have ruined everything if not handled correctly. A realization is presented at the end, pitting characters against each other and surprisingly, the question at hand of what to do next, is solved precisely as it should be at the cost of many lives. Whether he goes back to corporate America or stays a vigilante, Gibson's life will be forever changed. The very end might be a tad too conveniently wrapped up with a bow, but it does help bookend the film as a package of pure adrenaline rush, satisfying on a cerebral level through all the bells and whistles exploding around each corner.",7,1,7,28 June 2008
Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story," The wrong kid diedWalk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story
","That quote above could not have been more correct, however, not in the way Pa Cox intended. I was thinking more along the lines of wishing young Dewey had cut me in half, because had I been unable to watch the rest of the hour and a half to come, it would have been a much better experience. Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story is easily the worst movie I have seen all year long. There have been some bad films, but this was the first that made me look at my watch numerous times, praying that the horror would be over soon. No disrespect to John C. ReillyI think he is pretty good as the titular characterthe main faults, instead, lie in the writing, and for that I can only blame Judd Apatow. You may say, but Jake Kasden co-wrote it too, and that is all well and good. The reason I blame Apatow is because his last three ventures (40-Year Old Virgin, Knocked-Up, and Superbad) have been good if not great. He should have known better with this and made it differently. I think I even liked this less than Anchorman, and anyone who knows me will understand how bad that is.This thing is poorly written throughout. From the need to use full names when addressing any character so the joke can be understood, to the blatantly obvious descriptions coming out leaving nothing to the imagination or intelligence a person with a sense of humor has, Walk Hard talks down to the audience at every turn and bores the hell out of them. Some gimmicks are funny the first time, but than by the fourth it is way too old, (sorry Tim Meadows), and how many different ways must we see Dewey and Darlene partake in masturbatory motions while courting each other? Even the playing with time and the fact that he is 15 with a hit single, wife, and five children stifles any laughter later on because the writers seem to just want to beat a dead horse over and over and over again. It is really a shame, because this thing had potential.Reilly is fantastic as the hapless singer/songwriter pushed into the life of a rockstar by shear dumb luck. All the other cast members are funny as well; it just takes so much out of you watching the same situation relive itself that when the good parts come you just feel too tired to laugh. I actually contemplated walking out of the theatre, but could not bring myself to do so because I really wanted to see the Beatles scene. When it finally came, I could only manage a chuckle and by that time I figured I might as well see if the ending could bring anything to the table. Sadly it did not. Besides a montage of what appear to be gag-reel footage playing during Cox's final song, there is nothing but gratitude that the train wreck is over.There is a lot of talent involved and I kind of feel sorry for them. Maybe they all had a lot more to do and I should be blaming Kasden for poor directing, using bits that aren't funny and throwing the rest out for deleted scenes on the DVD. What happened to Jack White's 'cut a man in two' line from the trailerthat was funny. Instead his Elvis is pretty stupid and only brings out a reaction from me when he pulls out a pocketknife in the aforementioned end scene gags. The goofy music wears out its welcome fast too unfortunately, because each scene is orchestrated well, the jokes just fall flat. Even when it seemed there'd be a winner with 'Duet' song's use of innuendo before each verse is completed, the sequence goes on too long. I yawned more than laughed throughout the duration.Big applause to Jenna Fischer for being absolutely stunning and for holding her own opposite Reilly, in his element at all times. Raymond J. Barry is good as the father without love in his heart and it was fun to see SNL's Chris Parnell and UCB's Matt Besser adding a little flavor. The highlight, though, and only genuinely funny part for melike the gang war in Anchormanwas The Beatles. Paul Rudd, Jack Black, Jason Schwartzman, and yes, even Jimmy Fallon, are fantastic. I guess that scene alone, before it became a cartoon, was worth the dollar I paid to watch it.",2,9,19,31 December 2007
Disturbia," Coffee and donutsDisturbia
","I understand that the new movie Disturbia is about a person who is unable to leave his room and must look out the window for entertainment. During his peeping sessions, he finds that his neighbor might be a killer and by doing so, tries to get everyone around him to help find out the truth. That premise, and that premise alone, is the ONLY thing that likens this movie to Alfred Hitchcock's masterpiece of tension and technical genius, Rear Window. Director D.J. Caruso has taken this script, no credit listed to the writers of that classic, and created a contemporary world around which he can create a cat and mouse chase from the small radius that our protagonist is allowed to travel within having a house arrest anklet affixed to his leg. If the critics are to be believed that this is a ripoff/remake, then every romantic comedy coming down the pipeline is one as well. Boy meets girl, boy must win girl, conflict causes relationship to stay strained, boy ultimately wins girl. Actually since every rom-com follows that exact plot sketch, they are more derivative than Disturbia to Rear Window because Caruso takes a premise, updates it, and makes it his own.Worried that this might end up as another lame duck attempt from the director, I didn't have too lofty of expectations. I am a fan of Shia LaBeouf, ever since his 'Even Stevens' days, and knew he could give it credibility. Fortunately, after the highly disappointing Taking Lives and the ho-hum Two for the Money, it seems Caruso has come back to the form he had with his brilliant debut Salton Sea. Maybe it was the recent work on 'The Shield,' but we have some nice grit, close-up composition, and stylish camera-work. The realism from Sea is back and Disturbia brings it all to make one of the most entertaining films I've seen this year. We have fantastic humorLaBeouf's delivery and everyman rapport lends to this wellas well as effective scares and edge of your seat suspense. This is a PG-13 movie that knows what it is and rather than titillate with coming as close to the line as possible, stays in check and deals out a healthy dose of mood and emotion rather than blood and sex. I'd even go as far as saying Sarah Roemer's girl-next-door is the most sensual role this year. It is all about her confidence and eyes, her body language makes it work, and you fall for her just as LaBeouf does, whereas the usual R-rated nudity and over the top craziness has been going so far as to numb audiences by doing what every film now does. Credit Caruso for showing restraint for everything and leading us along by uncovering pieces of the story only when we need to know them.Besides LaBeouf, Roemer, and a funny turn from Aaron Yoo, the main driving force here is David Morse. This gem of a character actor is at the top of his game as the villainous, did he or didn't he, neighborhood serial killer. He is good as the conflicted heavy who does wrong only when the world around him has forced him to, (like in Dancer in the Dark and Down in the Valley), but he is perfect as the all out creepy, sly-smiling force being accused of kidnapping and killing numerous women. Morse was allowed to run free and he took the opportunity and went even further with it. Where many suspense films like this would become laughable eventually, the realism brought out through LaBeouf and Morse keep the audience enthralled and interested in how everything will play out. I was never bored and at times actually wondering what would happen next because I was so caught up. When the climax comes, I actually was surprised thinking it was crazy that they would get us there so early, but I was just so into it that I didn't realize how much time had past.Disturbia is a genre film and won't be winning any awards any time soon. What it may lack in total originality it more than makes up for in mood and effective thrills. It had everything you could want from a movie without making you have to think too much. Sit down, go for the ride and walk out of the theatre with the knowledge that your time was well spent. D.J. Caruso, thank you for redeeming yourself.",8,122,224,13 April 2007
The White Ribbon," I gave God a chance to kill me  Das weiße Band (The White Ribbon)
","Admittedly, I was underwhelmed at its conclusion. I knew it was something great, especially in construction and visual prowess, yet I couldn't shake that feeling of clouded mediocrity. And then, after talking about it with my friend for an hour or two afterwards, it hit me. Haneke has intentionally filled our minds with detail upon detail, setting up conspiracies and unsolved mysterious, leading us to believe things only to plant clues that refute them. Looking back, I found that each second stuck in my head; I couldn't shake even the minutest detail because it might hold the key to solving this puzzle. Deaths, tragedies, and accidents are happening every day, possibly connected, but how? Our narrator, the town's schoolteacher played by Christian Friedel, is relaying the events that occurred before being sent off to fight once the Archduke Ferdinand is assassinated. He believes the strange attitude and mysterious activities all began with a freak accident of the doctor. Riding his horse back home, he is thrown off when its legs trip on a wire spanning two trees, causing a lengthy hospital stay to recover. Next come a death, a kidnapping, and a beating, all unsolved despite hunches and hypotheses going through the town. Something is in the air, but what it is and what will come of it is unknown.The children are the key to everything. They are the easiest to blame, as it seems they are always there by the tragedies. Definitely hiding something, the kids begin to stare authority in the eye and practice what has been preached. Haneke mentions in an interview attached to the press notes that he wanted to show the sort of 'black' education going on at the time, breeding Fascism and terror. Good and evil fall to strict black and white, every action has a reaction, a punishment to set things right. The children are of an age that they are beginning to understand that life is not eternal, there are consequences in their actions and the adults are not afraid to tell them so. When you don't follow the rules, you will be caned, (a brilliant scene showing the young siblings enter the room, but allowing the audience to only see the closed door during the abuse), and you will have to wear the white ribbon in order to show the world your transgressions and need to earn back the right to be free, (the precursor to the Jewish stars perhaps?).What about the adults? What about those practicing adultery, or abuse of power, or destruction of property, or sexual abuse with a child? Who has the right to punish them? When, after the second kidnapping and beating of a young boy, a note is found stating intentions, that the children of transgressors will be discipline for four to five generations, you start to see the severity of the actions—as well as allusions to the Holocaust and the mass genocide of an entire people, rooting out the 'evils' of the world by excising the entire population, killing the bloodline at the source. But it can't be the children, right? They are too young and innocent, unknowing of the world set before them. Yet with the upbringing in this town, treated as adults with responsibilities and accountability, anyone would grow up fast. Cause a raucous in class and be chastised; be the leader and stand in the corner. Forgiveness is a liability. When the oldest girl, and leader of the wolves if you believe the children are the monsters, Klara, (wonderfully portrayed by Maria-Victoria Dargus), is ready to accept Communion, her own father, the pastor, (a menacing man of authority realized by Burghart Klaussner), pauses, contemplating whether she deserves it. You know he doesn't want to give in, family bond means nothing.Haneke has woven a tapestry of intrigue that will keep you on edge throughout. The anticipation of a solution is palpable, and the fact it is never released makes this film so riveting and unforgettable. The payoff is that these children will grow up into the generation that becomes the Nazi party, making this sleepy rural town a breeding ground for young Fascists that will change the world. Retribution is being taught, atoning for ones sins practiced. World War II is after all an answer to the punishment inflicted on Germany after the first, isn't it? It's a cycle of getting back, proving one's pride, and seeking revenge upon the children of the enemy if the enemy itself is unavailable. God's will has to be upheld and that intrinsic fact is ingrained in the minds of the youth. When Martin, an effective Leonard Proxauf, is discovered walking along the railing of a high bridge, he responds to the yelling of the man that finds him with the line used to title this review. If what he was doing was wrong—we can only infer on his role in the incidents occurring around him—then God would have let him fall, paying for his sins. But the fact that he gets to the other side unscathed only proves his work is that of the creator of man. Haneke says he had another name for the film, God's Right Hand, and I think it would have been just as appropriate a title. A powerful film, sharing so much information without any answers; it takes our mind into overdrive, trying so hard to find a reason for it all. But sometimes there are none; sometimes bad things just happen. You can only speculate and hope to prevent them from ever happening again.",10,155,184,18 September 2009
The 40-Year-Old Virgin," You know how I know you're gay?The 40 Year Old Virgin
","I will preface this review by saying I have never been the biggest Steve Carell fan. I love his bit parts, but seeing him in a lead role after having a start on 'The Daily Show' rubbed me the wrong way. Believing that I would hate his writing/lead role debut as much as I do Will Ferrell's multiple attempts, I shied away from checking the film out. Being that director Judd Apatow's sophomore film Knocked Up is hitting theatres this Friday, I decided to bite the bullet and finally see if the hype was true. All I can say is that this is the funniest movie I have seen since Hot Fuzz, and that says a lot since most American comedies of this ilk are fart jokes and horrible. The 40 Year Old Virgin is definitely the funniest film of 2005 and deserves all the praise it gets. Everything worked and I was laughing out loud throughout its entire duration, from the opening sequence of Carell trying to urinate to the ending song and dance routine of 'Age of Aquarius'absolutely priceless.As everyone who owned a TV two years ago knows, this film revolves around Carell's Andy and his revelation to coworkers that he is a virgin. The film soon progresses with their attempts to give him advice and his journey to get laid and find love in the process. Usually a premise as flimsy as this would not be able to sustain my interest for two hours, especially a comedy because it would be filled with filler gross-out moments that are so random you have to roll your eyes instead of laugh. The Forty Year Old Virgin never has a moment like this at all. Every gag or set piece is true to the story and nothing seems contrived for cheap laughs at the expense of the real story going on. Andy is a dork who has given up hope and decides to play video games and collect vintage toys rather than join the club scene. Although a dork, his coworkers soon find out that he is a funny guy with a lot to offer and they become close during the crusade. The underlying theme of love over sex and the power of friendship are there for sure, but the jokes are what make it all work. The touching moments are never sappy and when the sentimentality reaches the line of cheese, a one-liner or gag is thrown in to keep the pace fast and the story moving forward without pause.Sure the writing is top-notch. Carell and Apatow have woven together a wonderful tale here. The jokes are continuous and smart. There are bodily fluid moments, but the film doesn't rely solely on them. Really, though, it isn't always the script that succeeds, but the actors delivering the words. I can't think of a better foursome than Carell, Paul Rudd, Romany Malco, and Seth Rogen. I have been a Rudd fan forever and he definitely lives up to the reputation; Malco, brilliant in 'Weeds,' comes in and uses that role with a bit more everyman insecurity and hits it out of the park. As for Rogen, I haven't really seen him in anything. Supposedly he was in Donnie Darko, but don't ask me where. He really shines here and by this performance alone I have made my decision that Knocked Up is my movie choice this weekend and not something more serious and dramatic. Rogen is pitch-perfect in delivery and timing and his facial expressions and body language is fantastic. Mention should also be made for Catherine Keener, an actress whom I am also a big fan of. Her role needs to show her insecurity about dating a 'good guy' when she has always gone in the opposite direction. There is the right amount of awkwardness between the two leads, but also a perfect dose of chemistry to make the relationship real.Every supporting role is great as well and there are too many to name. Let's just say that I couldn't believe how many bit-players were played by people I recognized from other TV shows and moviesCarell even gets his wife into the action. With the ensemble assembled and the writing as good as it is, I don't know why I waited two years to finally experience the phenomenon. Even the soundtrack was mindblowing. Using the songs that are, in the context here, is ingenious. The final song and dance moment had me on the verge of crying and will not be forgotten any time soon. Do yourself a favor and see this film if you have not already.",9,1,3,28 May 2007
Ratatouille," He calls it his Tiny ChefRatatouille
","Brad Bird is by far the best writer/director of animated films coming out of America in a long time. Besides a Hayao Miyazaki, there is no one else with the track record that this guy has. From The Iron Giant to the Incredibles to now Ratatouille, Bird just gets better and better with each new move. This new Pixar installment is definitely the most intellectually stimulating yet, but really which of his films haven't been intelligent first, kiddie-catering second? Ratatouille is by all means cinematic in scope and execution. There is nothing to this movie that screams animation besides the fact that it is a cartoon. The characters are all well fleshed out with emotions and inner struggle to survive the lives they want at the expense of that laid before them. Each frame is also composed with a sense of cinematography for real life. The expanses of Paris are breathtaking to behold and many camera movements stay within the constraints of a true machine there to capture the action. Bird's world on display is all encompassing and you will be fully immersed into the tale, no matter what age, because it never loses its integrity or ability to surprise with its never ceasing authenticity.Pixar will always be at the top of the computer graphic echelon because they have never catered to the increasing trend of dumbing down to the lowest common denominator. It appears that the current trend in America has been to try and make everything too equal, thus simplifying things in order for those less motivated souls to understand and laugh at, at the expense of the intellectuals which should be allowed some intellectual stimulation as well. Rather than go for the 'fart jokes' and clichéd old-hat humor, Disney's newly bought animation studio has proved time and again that story is paramount and that without it, no means of skill or effects can survive. Locking up a talent like Bird for his most recent two films shows the dedication they have in getting the right people involved in the creative process. The backbone impetus of this story is not at all truly original. It is very much an ugly- duckling type tale of someone who has decided to go along a path different then his people have for generations. While being slightly ostracized at home, he goes into the world in order to find meaning and a use for his extraordinary skill. Since that skill is a keen sense of smell, what better occupation than gourmet chef is there for mixing those flavors at his service in unique and wonderful ways? Unfortunately, our hero is a rat, and we all know that they don't go with hygienic kitchens very well. He must find a kind soul to help him do what he was born to do, and with that fateful meeting in Gusteau's restaurant, our tale unfolds. By going against the stealing mentality of his fellow rats and living amongst the humans, I was starting to think we would eventually get to a point where his clan speaks of how he has angered the rat Gods and their supply of garbage has been cleaned up by environmentalists around Europe. I quickly hit myself in the head, remembered that this wasn't Happy Feet with rats, and sat back to enjoy a real fairytale story that didn't try to shove an agenda down my throat. Fairy tales tell of morals and happiness and originality succeeding over prejudice and Disney/ Pixar still knows how to deliver.Animation-wise, Ratatouille is a sight to behold. The fur on each rat is as tactile as that on Sully from Monsters Inc. and the liquids on display are gorgeous. Whether sewer water, Parisian streams, or blood red wine, each fluid is rendered with amazing clarity and realism. Even the human characters, something not often attempted by Pixar, are caricatured enough to make them slightly abnormal so that instead of looking at their humanistic flaws, we see them as just other animated creatures in a world of their own. Also, the set pieces are elaborate and highly detailed. The restaurant dining room is fantastically displayed and each swoop through the double doors of the kitchen brings you into a new world beyond the sinks and utensils. Even the underbelly passages of the rats are highly detailed as we go through them fast and furiously while our hero Remy runs to get above ground, going past numerous rooms that are seen through cracksa comically French domestic dispute among them until we get our first glimpse at the grandeur of Paris.Despite the beautiful graphics and the unobtrusively effective voice-overswhen you find you aren't wondering who is who, you know the acting is successfully integrated into the wholeit is the story that really shines. Bird has culled his imagery from many sources, including a bit of what I feel is Tim Burton for the nemesis food critic Anton Ego who eerily reminded me of Christopher Lee, yet has made everything his own. Remy the rat must fight against his heritage and his very being in order to live his life the way he wants to. There is a lot of comedy involved in getting the human Linguini to become his friend and partner on the journey to culinary perfection, but there is even more heart behind it all. We are treated to some nicely quirky supporting roles, but none are ever put to the forefront in order to overshadow the real stars. While not the ensemble these types of films usually are, our leads are strong and never falter to the point you wish we had more of the others. I accepted the terms of the plot early on and never tired of the journey Brad Bird and company led me on. Pitch-perfect at every turn.",9,10,15,23 July 2007
The Fast and the Furious," I smell skanks  The Fast and the Furious
","Ah, The Fast and the Furious, the film that launched the careers of Vin Diesel, Paul Walker, Jordana Brewster, and, for all intents and purposes, Michelle Rodriguez, (yes she starred in Girlfight previously). This foursome was so hot after this movie that some of them couldn't demean themselves by starring in the sequel. Poor them as, just a short eight years later, they all jumped at the opportunity to reunite with fast cars in the fourth installment. Oh how the mighty fall, especially when they weren't too mighty in the first place. I had my own preconceptions about this popcorn flick, virtually making me never want to take a chance on it at all. I thought the acting would be amateurish and campy, the story ludicrously absurd, and the cheese factor too high to overcome. Well, after finally sitting down to check it out I realized that I was clairvoyant. I wanted to at least have fun, and for a couple moments I did, but overall this Rob Cohen disaster is a throwaway that only shows how influential teenage boys are in the Hollywood spectrum. How else could we have three theatrically released sequels to what could be a made-for-TV movie at best? I see the similarities to Point Break, as my friend told me existed. It even goes to the point where if I closed my eyes I could have believed Paul Walker was Keanu Reeves. Where this film goes wrong, though, is by having Brewster's character involved, taking Walker's love away from Diesel. What works so well in the before-mentioned Kathryn Bigelow film is that there is more than just allusions to a man-crush between Reeves and Patrick Swayze. That dynamic doesn't quite exist here. Walker's Spilner/O'Connor may respect Diesel's Toretto, but he never idolizes the man. He sees a misguided soul that watched as his father burned to death on the racetrack, he sees a man who is nothing without his sister and racing team—his own makeshift family. Whether it is Toretto who is behind the truck-jacking or not, Walker is only staying close to find out, and get with Brewster's Mia of course.Speaking of the truck-jacking, is it just me or is that opening scene completely out-of-place? The film begins with four Hondas harassing a trucker, taking the driver out and, I guess, stealing the shipment. The cut is so abrupt that you never do find out what they do with the cargo, if anything. In fact, having the next scene in daylight with Walker, I thought maybe he was involved already, waiting for the criminals to meet up with him. Instead, he just floors his car, swears, and is all of a sudden at Mia's diner. It is so discombobulating that I seriously wanted to just turn it off. Only when Walker goes back to work at Harry's do we find out why he swore driving, and it's even longer until we find out where the trucks come into play. But this isn't trying to win awards for storytelling, it's just doing its best to entertain and titillate. Unfortunately, it did very little of either.The acting is pretty horrid across the board with Rodriguez probably the best of the four in a limited role. I didn't mind Diesel too much, the guy has charisma, but Walker's Keanu-speak was distracting because I don't remember him ever talking like that in other films. And when the cast is rounded off by stilted delivery from Rick Yune, Ja Rule, and Matt Schulze—the moment when Brewster asks Walker out and Schulze elbows the wall in anger made me laugh—you know you shouldn't be expecting very much else. Although, Chad Lindberg, as the whiz-kid engine technician, showed a lot of promise. I guess even the most asinine of films has a diamond in the rough somewhere.If anyone reading this has wanted to see it, don't let me stop you. I'm the first to admit that I have never seen the appeal of cars, either in their speed or in their look. The Fast and the Furious is all about the cars, so it had a pretty large strike against it from the beginning. I also don't particularly care for action films devoid of a strong story. That said, however, I had a fun time with the trucker's revenge sequence at the end watching Diesel attempt to save Schulze. It all kind of gets ruined with Vin's 'anger' afterwards and his blind rage for payback against Yune's Johnny Tran, but at least one high-octane moment kept my interest. It's a good thing too because the ending is as abrupt as the start, answering all questions about where our two leads' relationship will go with wordless looks and nods. These two understand each other; they are kindred spirits who have opened their souls. One is a hardened criminal and the other an undercover cop, both with the streets to unite them. No loose ends are sealed and the fate of many is left unanswered. I'd love to see how Walker explains who was stealing the electronic equipment to his superiors. The filmmakers probably never thought a sequel would be imagined and felt pretending it didn't matter would be enough.",4,1,3,12 July 2009
Control," Love will tear us apart, againControl
","Anton Corbijn has finally joined the ranks of his contemporaries Spike Jonze, Michel Gondry, and Mark Romanek in directing his first full-length feature. No one could have been a better choice than this still photographer and music video director of cutting edge bands like Depeche Mode, Echo and the Bunnyman, and, of course, Joy Division themselves with the video for Atmosphere (albeit eight years after the death of frontman Ian Curtis). Corbijn has the sensibilities to craft a gorgeous study of a man on the cusp of greatness and the humanity of himself, which keeps him from taking that next leap. The cinematography is glorious in its stark, high contrast, black and white, the performance scenes feel realistic and genuine, and he gets some monster performances from every cast member. Just a few hours ago I was once again mentioning to a friend my apprehension and dislike for biopics, and then I am treated to Control. Not only a biography that seems to truly capture the subject at hand, but also a superb film to stand alongside any genre out there.Joy Division's lead singer, as portrayed hereI will admit to knowing next to nothing about the band before viewing, possibly enhancing my pleasure as there were no trace of annoyance when something didn't mesh to realitywas not your run-of-the-mill rockstar. Ian Curtis was an everyman like you and me, a fallible creature, both confused and naïve in his young age. Marrying so early in life, Curtis had a child, a day job, and a gig fronting one of the hottest bands of the time. What started as a way for expression, however, soon becomes another slice of trouble in his already crumbling life. When diagnosed with epilepsy, a condition for which he once tried to help afflicted gain employment, he begins a regiment of medication concoctions, hoping to find a combination to alleviate the suffering. Mixed with his late night shows and high alcohol consumption, both frowned upon by his doctor, Curtis maybe the only star I know to have fallen into his psychological descent from prescribed drug use. Ever more depressed as his love blossomed between his wife, child, and mistress, Curtis could never find the balance to deal with the fame and the fans. After all he gave in life and onstage, they just had one answer for himWe want more.Truthfully, Sam Riley is quite a find. Whether his talent is real or just catered perfectly to this roleI'd like to believe the formerhe is amazing. Totally embodying Curtis, Riley's face is never shown with a shred of 'acting' noticeable. His blank stares, the weak smiles, the crying, and the pain of his seizures all come across as though we are viewing a documentary. Complete with Curtis' unique dance style, it is like watching history as it happens. Credit the rest of his bandmates for adding to the realism in each performance sequence, as well as the supporting cast. I was a bit unimpressed at first with Samantha Morton as his wife Debbie, but that feeling quickly went away. What appeared juvenile and trying too hard to play 20 years old eventually came together as a pretty solid piece of work. Always great, Morton shines when the world begins dissolving around her, but her love for her husband never wavers behind the tears and anger. Besides her, mention also needs to be made for Toby Kebbell as manager Rob Gretton. Starting as comic relief, his character plays a tremendous role in Curtis' life. While the band seemed to be unable to deal with their singer's affliction, Kebbell stays by his side throughout, doing what he can to try and keep him together.Control is a remarkable achievement that succeeds by adhering to the one aspect I like in biopics, keeping it simple. We are only shown a few years in his life, the meeting of his wife and bandmates and the short-lived tenure of what was Joy Division. This capsule in time is allowed to evolve and flesh out all the emotions and turmoil that went on. From the highs to the lows, the comradery to the adultery, Curtis is always portrayed as the tragic hero he was. Everything his music did for its listeners, all the power and hope it instilled in the fans, came at a steep price. Draining himself of life and confidence and love, Curtis was never going to be able to keep the ride going into the US. Corbijn gets every moment correct, straight through to the inevitable conclusion. Never trying to shock us, he treats the ending with immense compassion and love. Subdued and heart-breaking, Curtis' demise is allowed to be as beautifully touching as the rest of his ever-so-short time on earth.",9,3,5,18 December 2007
Tropic Thunder," Welcome to the goodie roomTropic Thunder
","Despite my somewhat indifference, bordering on dislike, of Ben Stiller and most of what he does, Tropic Thunder has been on my much-anticipated list for some time now. The audacity of what he was attempting, spoofing the industry that was giving him the money to do so, blatantly and lovingly, was too great to ignore. And then there is the cast of stars with cameo after cameo of surprise faces joining in on the fun, not to mention the intense marketing strategy pushing it along. Websites for each fictional actor, a site with clips from the Rain of Madness making of documentary (a Heart of Darkness send up 'directed' by co-writer Justin Theroux), and even a faux E! True Hollywood Story to air the week before its premiere in theatres just add to the mythology and attention to detail that went into its making. Now, having finally seen the end result, I must say it didn't let me down. True, I was expecting more in the way of story and plot, especially with all that background info manufactured, but when you get down to it, the entertainment value is off the charts, the one-liners are going to be quoted for years to come, and the laughs come often and hard.To take on subject matter as lofty as a send-up to war films, mainly Apocalypse Now, needs a certain amount to bravery and confidence to not care if it all backfires. The production value and effects make this seem as though it is a certified blockbuster falling apart at the seams. Sure the characters are funny and the events on display hilarious, but by the look and feel of the aesthetic, this is a war film to the end. Between that realism and the love I have for meta-narrative, there was little chance Stiller would be bombing in my eyes. Something about movies within movies intrigue the heck out of me, and this one having actors within actors just played up my interest more. There was truly no better way to start this movie then how was done: the playing of Alpa Chino's rap music, consumerism selling commercial and trailers for our three leads' previous films. What better way to be introduced to our action star, our funnyman, and our award winning thespian? Knowing full well the extent of satire going on, each spot delivers, giving a little background into the work these men have done in the past.Directly connecting with the subsequent shot, a live scene from the film at hand, the egos finally come out and show face. Jack Black's Jeff Portney reins in his comedian schtick to portray a hardened solider, voice rasping as he shows his serious side; Stiller's Tugg Speedman attempts to revive the action cred he tried to leave behind with his Oscar-bait turn as a mentally handicapped man in Simple Jack, where he went 'full retarded, no one ever comes back from that'; and Robert Downey Jr.'s Kirk Lazarus, Australian genius at his craft, playing a black man like he was born one. The scene continues without a hitch, explosions everywhere, screams heard in the distance, and a heartfelt death about to be delivered, until the men show their true colors. Tugg can't make himself cry, (he's just not that good), and Kirk's blubbering and drooling is just so real that the two must partake in a pissing match while effects guru Cody, (the red hot of late Danny McBride), let's loose the one-take only scorched earth fire storm. It's all falling apart and script-writer/former soldier Four Leaf, (the always gruff Nick Nolte), gets the director, (Steve Coogan with one of the best film exits I've ever seen), to agree on guerilla filming, deep in the jungle of foreign lands. Here is where the fun begins and where the movie inside the movie becomes real, or, in effect, the actual moviekind of like 'the dude playing the dude, disguised as another dude'. The levels at play here are just too many to mention.Besides a weakly written role for Black, the rest of the men are given enough to work with for some truly great moments. Stiller has a few instances where he returns to his over-long annoying routinepouring 'fake' blood into his mouth for onebut for the most part did a real good job, especially with his tough guy poses shooting off his gun. Jay Baruchel shines as the only non-celebrity involved, the guy who went to boot camp, read the novel and the script, and idolizes the men he is working with. Good to see him get a more beefed up role as opposed to the side parts in Apatow films. And the back and forth between Downey Jr. and Brandon T. Jackson's Alpa never get old. The whole dynamic of real black man versus fake was unceasingly funny.There were plot points that irked me throughout, TiVo's cameo being the biggest culprit, but I found myself pushing the problems aside and just enjoying the ride. Downey Jr.'s facial expressions, voices, and presence may steal the show, but what really allowed me to forget my worries was an absolutely brilliant cameo from Tom Cruise. His studio executive, pompously crass, loud-mouth made me think of all the horror stories you hear about the Weinsteins, and his dance moves can not be equaled. Tropic Thunder is first and foremost a vehicle for a bunch of friends to have a blast poking fun at their craft and really at themselves. I'll be remembering quotes all night now, thinking that while the story itself doesn't necessitate me watching it again soon, the jokes just might make buying it a mustnot to mention the wealth of extras that DVD is sure to have.",8,298,489,6 August 2008
Enchanted," The steel beast is defeated peasants, you are freeEnchanted
","In honor of the Thanksgiving holiday, I will post a family film review. Who better to deliver in that genre than Disney with their new animated/live action hybrid Enchanted. This movie is very cute and quite good at being both wholesome for the kiddies and tongue-in-cheek for the adults. You need to appreciate a studio being able to poke fun at itself. By using the classic stories of Cinderella, Snow White, and Sleeping Beauty, all made famous in their own right by the Mouse House, we are given some big laughs. The acting is very self-referential and broad as far as the fairy tale roles that make the journey into our world's New York City go. Screenwriter Bill Kelly gives the cast some great lines and set pieces to play in, ultimately showing us that the storybooks aren't always right. True love does exist, but not necessarily with the one you first think. The message is good, the songs are good, the animation and acting are goodDisney came through with this one. Along with Meet the Robinsons, Mickey and friends may be turning the ship around into a new renaissance.We are ushered into the story with some 2D animation of Giselle, a pretty girl looking for her Prince Charming. That man is in fact Prince Edward, recently being led by his stepmother's henchman to battle ogres and partake in adventure to keep his mind off a wife. You see if he marries, Queen Narissa loses her crown and he becomes King. She is having none of that and will cross into evil stepmother/queen/hag territory to trick Giselle into falling through a portal to our world. Now a fish-out-of-water, she must find her way back to her love, that eventually comes looking for her along with her best friend Pip the squirrel and the evil witch's lackey Nathaniel. It is on this path that she runs into divorce lawyer Robert Philip and turns both his and her life upside down.I love how the fantasy world comes into ours so awkwardly. Giselle's ability to call on all the animals of her meadows allows her to do the same in NY, only the creatures she gets are rats, pigeons, cockroaches, and fliesyet they all do the work anywayit's priceless. Also, when she breaks into song, all the people on the streets join along and have a blast being part of the huge choreographed numbers. Her innocence is very precious and trying new things always gets her new lawyer friend in trouble, yet helps those in her wake. Patrick Dempsey plays that friend to great effect. He sees what she is doing and can't help but fall for her joyful, inability to see cruelty in the world. Playing the straight man to her craziness leads to wonderful moments of laughter as well as those full of poignancy and compassion, giving the kids in the audience something to think about and lessons to learn.While Dempsey's evolution as a man is something to appreciate, it is the transplants that shine. Amy Adams and James Marsden play Giselle and Prince Edward respectively. They bring the happy-go-lucky mentality of Andalasia to our disenchanted realm. The over-acting is great and the culture shock fantastic. Adams is gorgeous and has the chops to make the aloofness work, but also change later on into a human being that sees what reality brings. When she tells Edward that she was thinking instead of singing, his reaction really hits home on the vast void between storybook fantasy and the real world. As for Marsden, his childish actions are truly funny; a borderline simpleton, he believes in chivalry and when he is told a suspected villain is really a friend, he just flips a switch and is OK with it. His smile is infectious and his vacant expressions indispensable to the film working on the dual levels it does.Everything works here to bring a wonderful family-friendly story to life. Complete with its pop-up book bookends, Enchanted is truly magical. I don't know how it could ever have worked as a complete animated work, as I have read it originated as, so thankfully they took the plunge to expand it with live action. Crossing between the two worlds is seamless2D characters turned into humans or 3D computer generated animals. With many instances ripe for a wrong turn, the filmmakers seem to come to all the right decisions. Working in older Disney yarns and playing each story thread to its effective conclusion leaves us with a tale that could become a classic amongst the ones it appropriates. So, if you are looking for a way to spend a couple hours with the whole family, Enchanted is definitely a great way to go.",8,156,176,22 November 2007
The Duchess," Freedom in moderationThe Dutchess
","Keira Knightley's period drama for the year 2008 is a well-crafted one, but lacking in anything new and exciting. The Dutchess is your run-of-the-mill tale of unrequited love amidst the artifice of a marriage of utility. It all begins with a gathering of teenagers, playing their games in the yard while the adults talk inside, planning the futures for their children behind closed doors. When Georgiana's mother tells her how she will be the next Duchess of Devonshire, you are almost shocked at her reaction. So happy and excited that a man could love her after only two meetings, she cannot wait to leave and start her new life  seemingly forgetting all about that boy in the yard for whom she obviously has feelings for. This is a time of regimented rules, of lives orchestrated for success and not allowed to spontaneously evolve. A decision that I don't think she could have said no to anyways just set up her entire life's journey, one full of happiness, wealth, and eventual heartbreak.I wasn't quite sure what to expect going into the film. I had heard the stuff about how Georgiana was the Empress of Fashion and thought maybe this would tell about her designing sense while also her life. Maybe it was going to be a romance or a tale of deception and intrigue, a behind the scenes look at royalty. Instead of any of those, The Duchess ends up really being just a bio-pic disguised as an historical drama. At times it seems like some interest is about to show face as we learn early on about Her Grace's penchant for politics and desire for all people to be free. It actually seems like we're about to watch her fight for women's rights and equality, but instead the topic is glossed over and she becomes the face of the Whig Party, not a vocal piece to the puzzle. Even the fashion aspect is thrown to the side. The Duke mentions it once and she is introduced at some sort of fashion show later on, but after a funny speech, it is back to the pomp and circumstance of the royal way of life.Whether the film succeeds or not doesn't detract from the fact that the attention to detail is quite nice. Director Saul Dibb has gotten a crew to recreate the time period, actors to inhabit their roles, and an all-around authentic look. I love the moments looking through the windows towards the outside. The glass is fogged and warped as it was back then and the compositions frame the characters of importance with the clear portions, while the others are distorted in the imperfections. Pacing-wise, the film never really drags. It is all composed nicely, spanning the 6-8 years from marriage to the bearing of an heir. The film itself is not boring; it is the story that becomes mediocre and obvious while the cast still intrigues throughout it. Once the relationships and affairs all become public knowledge to the audience, it is just a matter of what will happen next? Unfortunately, that is a question that didn't interest me as much as what could have been looking at different aspects of Georgiana's life, rather than just the marriage itself.Knightley must be given credit for pulling off another turn in a corset, long dress, and numerous wigs. Almost appearing to be a glutton for punishment, she just seems to flock to this type of role. But with good reason, she is solid throughout, showing her youthful exuberance as well as her stubborn disgust at the injustices put upon a woman in that time period. Much smarter than one would expect from a girl sent off to become a Duchess for the sole purpose of conceiving a male heir, Georgiana is a fascinating woman.Her husband is played by the great Ralph Fiennes in a role that I am not used to seeing him in. The Duke of Devonshire is very much an automaton going through life fulfilling his duties. Unless with his beloved dogs, Fiennes gives off a cold dead persona, breathing as little life into the part as possibleand that is a compliment, not an insult. He is the kind of guy that just walks away from the group when he is done or bored, he doesn't have to explain himself. Fiennes makes this man sympathetic somehow, showing the audience that beneath the harshness lays a man trapped into a life he cannot leave. He looks out the window at his children and wonders at how free they are. Here is a man in charge of everyone, but alone living for the title. He has an image to uphold and unfortunately that means he must be strict and decisive when it comes to events that could tarnish his reputation and image, events that the Duchess throws his way often.Don't get me wrong, some of the love triangles are interesting to see fleshed out with the wonderful supporting cast, it's just that I wish there was more weight to the story with those moments only complementing. Dominic Cooper's Charles Grey, the boy from Georgiana's childhood, adds a layer with the inevitable affair, and the character of Bess Foster, played by Hayley Atwell, is perhaps the most interesting of them all. At first the Duchess' best friend, she becomes her husband's mistress and lover as well, creating a dynamic unused to in films like this. The three live together, all for their own needs. One for his title and heir, one for the power to have her children returned to her, and the other, trapped in her life now, to have some semblance of meaning. It's definitely the most off-the-wall aspect of the story, but unfortunately not enough to make The Duchess any more special than the next period drama to come, or the last before it.",6,35,59,2 October 2008
Resident Evil," Project Alice is onlineResident Evil Trilogy
","Paul WS Anderson has given us the newest trilogy of diminishing returns. I have never played the video game before and therefore went into the 2002 original Resident Evil containing little knowledge of the mythology. With that novice mentality, I found myself really enjoying the film. It gave me the background needed, the action and suspense expected, and a cliffhanger leaving me anticipating more. That continuation came but two years later with the subtitle Apocalypse. Here was a film that showed how the series' origin story was a huge part to the main plot of the first. This entry featured a bare-bones story, namely the extraction of a scientist's child from the infected Raccoon City, yet that was okay. The action was amped up, the characters more accessible, the acting vastly superior, and the ingenuity evolved. While lacking in plot, it excelled in action and effects, making it an equal, in my mind, to its predecessor. Its final twenty minutes was even devoted entirely to setting up the third piece to the puzzle. Here, though, is where the train derails hard. Extinction had a fantastic setup, yet instead of continuing right where we left off, we meet a caravan of survivors seeking gas and motoring cross-country. Nothing is progressed story-wise that we already did not know. Where the sparse plot didn't matter in the second, it stuck out like a sore thumb with the latest installment.It is Milla Jovovich's total blank slate in the first film, which makes it so endearing. We learn what the Umbrella Corporation is all about as she slowly remembers her role with them. It was a successful zombie movie, utilizing the jump scares and the hyperkinetic pace needed to keep you on the edge of your seat. All the characters were enjoyable to spend time with, we got zombified dogs, and a story that kept a bit of intrigue as to what everyone's motives were, while also being intelligent enough to keep my full, undivided attention throughout. The demise of all the people involved was interesting and to have a film end badly for all was a nice breath of fresh air. Alice does wakes up at the end, alone in a ravaged city, but she is definitely not in a position to rest up or smile at her good fortune.The transition into the second film is then seamless. We find that she didn't just wake up, but in fact is an experiment let loose on a city that cannot be saved. Our two survivors from the original are now pitted against each other to see which is the better soldier, and therefore the more effective military weapon. This fight is the entire story, though, as far as the main mythology goes. Otherwise, we have Alice and her new band of warriors on the lookout for the virus' creator's daughter. In effect, then, the whole story could have been told in about twenty minutesthey go in and get the child, Alice and Nemesis fight, boom, the film is over. However, the tale is padded with huge action sequences and gory zombie carnage. With the addition of Mike Epps to the cast, we are also treated with some nice comic relief, missing somewhat from the first besides Michelle Rodriguez's sarcastic quips. I never minded the simplicity of it all because it never tried to be more than what it was. I stuck with it until the conclusion and found myself even more excited for the third part. The setup had so much potential. Alice was fully formed, all her memory intact, and a new ability in telekinesis. With Nemesis gone and the zombies no match for her, we could finally get to see the showdown between her and the Corporation itself.And with that, we are treated to Extinction. It starts off pretty good with a cloned Alice being put through tests in a mock-up version of the mansion from the first film. It gets intriguing to hear what the scientists have been up to and to learn that Alice is outside trying to find survivors and keep herself off the grid. Then we get the first sign of trouble, an action scene that has nothing to do with the plot. Let's kill some hicks in the desert. If that wasn't enough, we also get a twenty-minute fight between our survivors and crowsyes those pesky black birds, newly infected. Sure the payoff is great, but really we are now halfway through the film and all that has happened is Alice found her old friends. We already knew she had powers and that her blood was special and could mean everything to the project. At the end of the film, that is the exact same knowledge we are left with. Besides many deaths and what could be the beginnings of a complete trainwreck of a sequel, starring no one else but Jovovich, (you'll understand when you see it), we learn absolutely nothing as far as mythology goes. I felt cheated and let down greatly because this film could have done so much more.In conclusion, the trilogy starts strong and ends with a disappointing whimper. The first had everything you could have wanted in a sci-fi/zombie/action flick. Scares, plot twists, and loads of violence and gore rounded out the successful entry. In came the second, lacking substance, but making up for it with flare. More characters, which never hurt the proceedings, more blood, more action, and more monsters can only mean non-stop enjoyment. And if the film doesn't deserve an extra point or two for Sienna Guillory's Jill Valentine, then you must have watched a different film from me. Next came the unfortunate failure of a third. What is less even than a bridge to the inevitable fourth, (will the box-office be enough to warrant it?), this last entry is a wasted opportunity to add to a nice little franchise.Resident Evil 7/10 RE: Apocalypse 7/10 RE: Extinction 3/10",7,2,3,21 September 2007
Quantum of Solace," You only need one shot  Quantum of Solace
","Wow, remember when Casino Royale came on the scene and gave the Bond franchise a shot of adrenaline that no one expected? How Daniel Craig brought grit and realism to a series slowly finding its way into parody and gadgetry, trying to make up for the fact its leading man was getting on in age? Not only was it a great Bond/action film, but a great film periodfull of quality performances, action, intrigue, intelligent scripting, and plenty of eye-candy for the men and ladies alike. To top all of that, the next installment, Quantum of Solace, brings in a high quality director, (in my opinion at least), in Marc Forster. A visual genius and master of tone and drama, I was very much excited. However, after viewing the finished work, I finally find myself agreeing with the many people perplexed and annoyed by the cryptic title. Granted, not because its obtuse, I actually dig it a lot for that reason, but because it wasn't as appropriate as Casino Royale Part 2. That is exactly what this film is, a short (106 minutes) story tying up loose ends from the previous one, allowing Bond to get revenge, to get information on Mr. White, to bolster his relationship with the Americans, and to progress him into the ladies man we know him to be, one who doesn't let lingering feelings get in the way of the job. Yes, the flash is fun, the explosions and running invigorating, but in the end, it all just leads us to the next segment in Craig's adventures  a bridge to what will hopefully be great and nothing more.Forster does a bang up job with a script that includes, for long stretches, sequences devoid of language. The choreography is very intricate and shot clearly despite the quick cuts and shaky-cam kinetic motion. I loved the fall from a roof top onto scaffolding, the depth and length that they fall with the camera following is impressive, and although it hitches, probably showing that it wasn't a real long take, it still put a smile on my face. Also, the giant fire set-piece during the climax has some great shots, especially those involving breaking glass, which is a common occurrence throughout and handled well each time. I just wish Paul Haggis and company gave him a little more to do with the story itself. It all becomes a way for Bond to get revenge on the man that put Vesper into the situation she was in, making her become a double agent, in effect working for the ever-elusive Mr. White. It's his story that I desired here, but unfortunately we'll have to wait a little longer for that one.So, basically we have a villain in Dominic Greene, (a nefariously good Mathieu Amalric, even though he is for the most part wasted in a thankless role), pretending to investors to be an environmentalist when in fact he is working with third world nations to put a stranglehold on oil  or is it another liquid he covets? Either way, it struck me that, with some snide remarks about the American dollar, the oil business being carved up by the US and China, and the overall 'green' theme of Greene's front, the writers were trying too hard to push a liberal agenda. Maybe they weren't, though; maybe I was just so bored with the lack of substance in Bond's search for revenge that what ended up sticking were all those ideas and political sentiments. Unfortunately that is what stuck. Instead of giving Amalric some backstory and structure, he becomes a pawn, a creation put in the middle of Mr. White and Vesper Lynd's ex-boyfriend who was 'kidnapped' in the previous film. He is a token shell of a baddie that gives Bond something to play against until he can move along to the big fish, his quest for blood soon quenched.Along the same lines comes Camille, the Bolivian Special Forces agent out for a little blood herself. Olga Kurylenko does a good job, balancing the sex appeal with the undercover agent well; being a Bond-girl by not being a Bond-girl. But again, she serves mainly to mirror Bond's own quest and be the foil to whether he will continue killing prospective captives for information without remorse or if his wits will again be restored. At least Giancarlo Giannini's Mathis and Jeffrey Wright's Felix Leiter bring some important plot-points to the forefront in their five minutes of combined return screen time; it's as though the small roles were more integral to the overall story than the ones we saw every second of the way.What Quantum of Solace truly brings to the table is action, action, action. Daniel Craig is James Bond; the guy is a machine and my new personal hero. Besides all the injuries and partially lost finger during filming, the film itself shows the scars and bruises he must have experienced. This guy is throwing his body against walls, through glass, and running like a mad man. You cannot fault the pace and abundance of chase scenes or the carnage they leave in their wake. It all begins with a high-powered car chase without any explanation at all  and none is needed. You can see the wheels turning behind Craig's eyes, the last glimpses of emotion and love draining from his consciousness as the job gradually takes over. So, while the film can't stand on its own, it is a very nice bookend to the tale from a couple years back, one that many thought too long and drawn out, things you won't be saying upon exiting the theatres this year. Hopefully it's not a sign of things to come, though, and the next chapter will bring us another stellar story on the journey to find out exactly who Mr. White is and what his organization is capable of.",5,2,4,13 November 2008
No Country for Old Men," Got some hard bark on that oneNo Country for Old Men
","While No Country for Old Men is not a perfect film, it is masterfully crafted and orchestrated to brilliant effect. My only reservation here is the lethargic pace in a few moments, but mostly the ending that seems to go on for about ten minutes too long. I will fault that with the brothers' adapting process of Cormac McCarthy's novel. We are able to drop so many characters throughout the proceedings without a second thought, that the necessity to go back to Sheriff Bell at the end was a bit too out of place, waxing poetic for pretension sake. Otherwise, there is very, very little not to like.Upon viewing the trailer, I was under the impression the story would be more than just about a man stumbling upon two million dollars and his attempt to elude capture by the enigmatic Anton Chigurth. However, much to my surprise, and ultimate approval, there was not. Every periphery character comes to the story for the sole purpose to enhance the central plot and give a bit more information on the cat and mouse chase. It truly is Josh Brolin's stoic Llewelyn Moss versus Javier Bardem's psychopathic Chigurh, and these two do not disappoint. I cannot believe Brolin almost wasn't in the film at all. He had done a test reel with Robert Rodriguez during Grindhouse filming and sent it in for review only to find that the Coen's wanted to know who lit it, not more about the actor included. With a little pressure from his agent, the brothers reluctantly took a meeting, pretty much when the audition process was over, and that was all she wrote. Who says some hard work and persistence can't get you anywhere? It may have gotten Brolin in an Oscar winning film.The leads are so good here, they don't even need to speakand believe me they don't for much of the movie. Sans score/soundtrack, the quiet foreboding atmosphere and the shear expression of exertion, mentally and physically, on either's face amps the tension and suspense to unforeseen levels. I was on the edge of my seat for practically the entire film, waiting anxiously to see what carnage Bardem would leave in his wake and if Brolin would once again escape, barely able to walk, for a freedom that probably wouldn't last too long. I can't think of any character more menacing them Bardem in recent memory, if ever. With his Dutch Boy haircut, sly smirk when speaking, and harsh deep accent, he would give even the most unfretted person shivers. And his air gun contraption always dragging behind him is a fantastic touch. With so few words emitted, the props do all the speaking for him.Every supporting role is magnificently handled as well. If the Coens know one thing, it is the small town, country bumpkin mentality. The old southern drawls and longwinded ways to say simple things, with just the right amount of flair to leave you shaking your head about how real people don't talk that way, are here in force. Kelly Macdonald plays the wife who knows what's happening but never lets on to perfection and Garret Dillahunt is a riot as the smarter than his words deputy. His description of the shootout is hilarious and his back and forth with the sheriff always entertaining. That sheriff, played by Tommy Lee Jones, is also spectacular. He is the stand-in for the old men of the title, a lawman from a bygone era trying to understand the cruelty and deceit running rampant. Brought up by men who did their duty without the need for a gun, now chasing around murder after murder with federal agents going over every gruesome detail ad infinitum, he knows he is outmatched, and realizes he just doesn't have the stomach to exist in this new world. We get all that from his character and his actions alone, we don't really need the epilogue of him visiting people from his past to discover it for himselfit is a bit of overkill. Oh, and don't forget the city-types in Woody Harrelson and Coen regular Stephen Root, both funny and effective in small roles.What really stands out, though, is the storytelling on display. The Coens are not afraid to go slow and make everything perfect. Each time I found myself questioning something about how Brolin's Moss was handling a situation; I soon got my answer with him waking late at night with an epiphany. Those two moments were a revelation, as though the filmmakers were reading mind. Every motivation was spot-on and each word carefully placed with minimalist precision, letting the audience know exactly what they need, no more/no less. The film is also beautifully shot and composed. There must have been some storyboarding going on because some of the set pieces and angles are breathtaking. You know exactly what is in store from the beginning as you see Bardem quietly getting free from his handcuffed position to kill his first victim, all while being blurred in the background. We need to see this blood and violence at the start to understand his malice and remorseless attitude, but the Coens know too much can be too much. Towards the end we only see the aftermaths and residuals from the killings. What was once shown to startle, with its brutality, eventually changes to become a device for us to now watch the killer's face as he commits his atrocities. He seems to have become slightly unglued; perhaps meeting a formidable foe for once, and we are forced to peer on his impatiencejust one more detail woven into the effective tapestry of this film. Welcome back Joel and Ethan; hopefully you will stay for the long haul.",9,2,9,21 November 2007
The Love Guru," Mariska HargitayThe Love Guru
","I've always been told that if you have nothing good to say, don't say anything at all. So, I have to tell you all the best parts of the new Michael Myers vehicle, The Love Guru. You've got one really funny joke about Guru Pitka's mom getting a job that kills even though it was in the trailer, Stephen Colbert finally hits one out of the park as a robot cyborg after failing three previous times to elicit any laughs, Jessica Alba is gorgeous as always if you overlook her atrocious acting abilities, and Justin Timberlake shows he has no shame and steals every single second of screen time he is given. If Jacques 'le coq' Grande had his own film, I'd pay to see it. Being that he is included in one that relies on physical humor, asinine wordplay, sexual innuendo, and Myers making a complete idiot of himself as he kills the funny out of every only slightly funny gag he does, Timberlake becomes the only reason I can say it was worth going to a free preview. The Love Guru is quite possibly the worst film I have ever seen and once I'm done writing this review I am going to crawl into bed and cry as I remember So I Married an Axe Murderer and the times when Myers could do no wrong (thanks for the Wayne's World callback Mike, you actually made me realize how inferior this film is more).There is truly no point in describing a plot because there isn't one. The film exists as a series of set-pieces allowing Myers to act up his schtick and try to cause uproarious laughter in the audience. Besides some faint giggles at the fact that Myers himself smiles and winks at the camera, telling us he just told a joke, there is not too much to go on here. Sure there is a ton of uncomfortable laughter and gasps of awe at the wordplay'can't face' said real fast to sound likeahemthat you are shocked to hear in a PG-13 film, but does that really make you think the this was a success? I mean, the main focus is supposed to be the idea that Pitka has been hired to get the star player on the Toronto Maple Leafs back with his ex-girlfriend so that his hockey skills will return and win his owner, the second generation of a cursed family, 'Stanley's Cup'. You almost believe this thread has some merit until the resolution is glossed over quickly and rectified without the bat of an eye. The thing is held together by concert interludes of Myers singing in his way over-the-top Indian accent for entire songs. Can you say filler? (Although I will admit, 'More Than Words' was fantastic, especially the visual nods to the actual Extreme video.) I might be wrapping this review up quickly to rest. My neck has some pain from too much shaking out of embarrassment for those collecting their paychecks on the screen. You could literally see the ca-ching dollar signs popping out of their eyeballs with every awkward moment. Some of the sight gags were funny, the first time they were used. I enjoyed the motorized magic carpet, the utter stupidity of Verne Troyer's office being half size, and the 'Kelestrator' of course, (I wonder why they didn't TM that one). Admittedly, though, this is not my kind of comedy. While I enjoy a good low-brow laughfest like the next guy, I still would rather have a somewhat decently constructed story, something this tale lacks completely. Had the gags been separated and shown on a TV skit show, I might be calling them genius, however, when you string them together with the only common denominator being that the same characters are used, it gets old fast. Unfortunately, this film will work for a good chuck of America, but I just can't condone the spending of millions of dollars on something so trite and unenjoyable as this packaged and sold mess.Now I don't want to leave Timberlake as the only good thing here. That would be doing a disservice to Manu Narayan who played Myers' assistant. With spot-on timing and perfect facial expressions, it was good to see someone having fun playing off of the grotesque guru. A nice companion, he actually makes Pitka better each time they are doing a skit together. I'm not really sure what to say about Myers himself. On one hand, he totally commits to this character and must be given credit for that fact. The problem is, though, that the role itself is paper-thin and very, very tiresome. As for Romany Malco, our second leadalthough he got the shaft of no top-billinghe does well for what he has been given. Come on man, you were in the amazing 40-Year Old Virgin and have a hit TV show 'Weeds' for which you are a big part of its success. Please take the time to do some work that has merit. I mean, wow, who'd have thought I'd be saying Get Smart might be your best movie option this weekend.Oh, and Ben Kingsleycan I have a word? I am going to have to take away your knighthood. Yes, I know how much you like it and how hard you worked to achieve the title, but I can't allow someone with as little self respect as you keep the 'Sir'. Why, oh why, would you continue to do drivel like this? You are an Academy Award winning thespian. I can only hope The Wackness is as good as it seems so you may redeem a little bit of that respect in my eyes.",1,101,183,17 June 2008
District 9," There's many secrets in  District 9
","Remember those great Mechwarrior-like short films that sprang up as a sort of resume reel when Jackson shone the light onto this South African filmmaker? No? Okay, well maybe I'm that much of a geek, but everything he did in those test shoots has been brought to the big leagues with the precision and handling of a seasoned professional. Taking place in the Johannesburg slum of District 9, the quartered off area housing our alien 'visitors' since 1982, the film is shot documentary style as the MNU, (Multi-National United), go through the process of relocating them to a safer place outside the city—safer for the South African citizens that is. The section of land has become a cesspool of these 'prawns' as they scavenge, fight, and barter with the local Nigerian crimelords, trading their highly sophisticated weaponry, (that can't be used by humans due to their biological components), for the delicacy that is cat food. Think Alien Nation meets Cloverfield in a story about race relations and you'll begin to comprehend the vision put forth. I'll just say the locale of Blomkamp's hometown for this tale is not coincidental  the Apartheid allusions are fairly obvious to see.Discovered malnourished and scared, the South African government brought them down to the surface and even learned their language. It was never to assimilate and educate, however, but only to understand, hope to steal their technology, and capture them for medical experiments. The MNU isn't only an establishment for the safe keeping of societal bliss over the fence; no, it is also one of the leading manufacturers of weaponry and military goods. Everyone has an ulterior motive; it's the name of the game.Caught in the middle of it all is Wikus Van De Merwe, played with poise and experience by Sharlto Copley. It is his only credited role for which I can see and man does it deliver. At first a simple pawn married to the MNU head's daughter, he can appear to be a bit on the dull end of sharp, yet his face is never without a smile, endearing him to his men. He is assigned to head up the eviction committee that will go door to door and serve each prawn its notice of relocation. Followed by a cameraman and accompanied by a new trainee, as well as a soldier he knows, the foursome start their rounds and discover hidden arms holdings, understanding aliens, hostile aliens, and new technology that can only be nefarious. The opening remarks by interviewees alludes to an incident involving Witkus, one that many can't believe he partook in, one that may or may not have resulted in his death due to the multiple uses of the past tense. It doesn't take long before the catalyst to these new feelings of hatred and sorrow for a man loved by all occurs, bringing him into a world of darkness, but also one of understanding—putting his differences aside to work with the aliens. For someone with a clear hatred of the prawn kind, he still sees them as more that just an animal. One can't deny their intelligence or the fact of their cognitive abilities, making them possibly more advanced than humanity itself.It is Copley that makes the film what it is through his evolution as a man. The transformation he takes from a weak idealist cowering from the army man who is technically in his control to the confident fighter willing to risk his life for the cause of moral righteousness is unavoidable. You won't believe at the end when cuts to his later self are juxtaposed with earlier footage before the relocation program that they are the same person. War can do funny things to a man, especially when the sides are blurred and the idea of what's right and wrong becomes flipped. As his counterpart, however, mention needs to be made for the amazing visual effects. The aliens he encounters are rendered beautifully and fit in their environments as though they are real flesh and blood. Blomkamp even finds room to include one of his Mechwarrior-esquire creations as an alien-made suit. These creatures show emotion and seamlessly integrate with the live actors to make the plausibility of everything happening real.District 9 asks the question of how far we as a race will go for power. If a technology is discovered that is so advanced it can only be used by the enemy, to what lengths can one be willing to live with in order to adopt its use for ourselves? What if one of us is inexplicably turned into a hybrid creature, one with the humanity necessary to fight for good but the biology to use those weapons that are destroying us? Would the government help that person and treat him with respect and worth, or would they look upon him as an abomination, valuable only as a control subject to be poked, prodded, and eventually dismembered in an effort to mass produce? You'd like to think that as a people we have evolved to the point where compassion and understanding can trump any fears and insecurities we may have, but history begs to tell a different story. Throughout time we have oppressed and experienced the drive for power and leadership. By using a legion from another far away planet, Blomkamp has put a mirror up to the world, showing it its true colors. Can a movie make a difference? Maybe, maybe not. Either way, the political undertones are there to make viewers think afterwards and the action packed journey of a man without a home keeps them in their seats with a riveting and thrilling tale told through a singular vision. See Hollywood? Sometimes fresh new ideas can not only push the limits of the medium, but also become huge critical and financial successes.",9,3,7,16 August 2009
The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford," Recapitulating the act of betrayalThe Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford
","In what could be my favorite film name of all-time, The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford is much more than its superfluous moniker. From its bloated runtime to its slow, methodical pace, Andrew Dominik's epic tale contains an inner beauty that allows for all the pretensions one seems to associate with it. Dominik is unrelenting on his quest to tell the story the way he wants it told, never compromising by cutting scenes or shortening the name so it will fit on theatre marquees. The film even seems to have been languishing in the doldrums for over a year before finally seeing the light of day. Maybe the time was spent because no one would distribute it without changes, and if that is so, I'm glad to have waited for its introduction. Had anything been compromised, I don't think I would have enjoyed my time nearly as much. Do not expect the wild west or gun fights at every corner. This is not a tale of excess or young guns, but instead one of paranoia, suspicion, friendship, and betrayal from all sides.I thought I would be seeing James during his heydays of robbery and murder, eventually meeting his demise at the hands of one of his crew. Instead, we are introduced to the legend just before his final night ride with brother Frank. It is the last train robbery he undertook, before attempting to retire home with his wife and kids, that he meets the Ford brothers and their ragtag degenerate friends. James is no longer as God-like as he might once have been. A shell of his former self, he is constantly uprooting his family, children who don't even know his real name, in fear of capture by the Pinkertons. Always paranoid and untrusting of those around him, after all his brother has retired and his normal crew all gone, jailed, or dead, James begins to fear for his safety. By riding to cleanse himself of those that may be conspiring against him, he begins a journey that will take him back into the friendship of Robert and Charlie Ford. Whether from depression caused by the memories of all he has done or an escalation of the malice and crazed disposition that allowed him to do it, this reunion for a series of planned bank robberies finally leads to his end.Dominik's film is filled to the brim with nuance and subtlety. At every turn we are even quiet moments of the landscape and metered prose of speech, slowly contemplated and released into conversation. Everything is orchestrated with great care and each frame a thing of beauty. The film must have been storyboarded like crazy because the compositions of each scene is balanced and gorgeous to behold. From the extreme close-ups, the smoke-laden atmosphere, and the visions from behind period-aged impure glass, Dominik has taken painstaking care in making sure each second is perfect. Even the narrated moments telling of James' past are vignetted and blurred to give a sense of age and dream-state. Everything is deliberately timed, both enhancing the period being portrayed and adding to the mood and almost nonexistent changes in mental disposition as the wheels turn inside each character's head.All the acting on screen is top-notch. Brad Pitt really shows how good he is as the man behind the stories. This is a time of instability for him as his state of mind causes uncontrollable outbursts of violence followed by fits of laughter at the lapse in control. He realizes that he is not himself anymore and it is this knowledge of his own fallibility that makes him even more cautious of what is happening all around him. Did he deserve the best actor award at Venice this year? I don't know. He is very good, possibly close to his best, however, he was overshadowed, to me, by costar Casey Affleck's Robert Ford. He truly shines as the young kid able to ride alongside his idol only to be shot down as strange and queer. His joy, expressed very openly to his hero, comes at a very bad time. Just as James starts to look at everyone more carefully, in comes this kid with a dangerous obsession. As Pitt says before sending Ford away, 'I can't tell if you want to be like me, or be me.' Affleck's performance is one of the years best. The times when he must try and hide the rage bottled up inside while his dreams of being the James Brother's sidekick shatter are tough to watch. From this showing, Ford was no coward, but a man tired of being kicked while he was down. Perhaps the act of murder itself was cowardly, but only because of the circumstances surrounding it. Ford was working for the sheriff in order to capture the criminal, but when the opportunity presented itself, when James finally realized what was to happen, you can't help feel sorry for the 20-year old has he wrestles with what is about to transpire.I applaud Dominik for having the courage to create something that is by no means a bankable commodity. For every person that goes to see Brad Pitt's new movie, there will be at least three that scoff at the almost three-hour duration and slow unfolding of plot. Either way, this film is a masterpiece to behold, a work of art encapsulating a moment of history. Even the epilogue, of what happens to Ford after the assassination, helps shape the motivations for all that transpired during the course of the film. It never feels boring and it never shies from the weight it carries on its shoulders. The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford is simply something that needs to be seen to understand the effect it has, and that experience should be at the theatre so its composition and visual splendor can be viewed in all its glory.",9,22,34,13 October 2007
Batman Begins," I warned you about compassionBatman Begins
","Starting with a nice sequence of flashbacks mixed within the natural progression of our entry point, we are treated to Bruce Wayne's life and struggle within it, which pushed him to go underground amongst those he wished to rid the world of. A criminal himself, practicing his fighting skills, Wayne soon becomes acquainted with Henri Ducard, the right hand man of the 'immortal' Ra's Al Ghul, leader of the League of Shadows. He trains and learns the ways of the ninja to conquer his fears and be the ultimate machine needed to go against the crumbling world, specifically the devolved cityscape of Gotham. Finding out the truth of the group, that they wish to destroy in order to have a rebirth, Wayne leaves the hostile situation to return home and do what he can as a symbol for hope. Back in Gotham, he must walk the tightrope of keeping his crime fighter persona as secret as possible, namely by being the hardest partying, biggest spending millionaire the city has ever seen. By showing the world his playboy ways, he is free to consume his real self in honing his skills and toys to making sure Batman has all he needs to succeed on the streets.There is of course an elaborate scheme at play, one to release a toxin in the air that makes people fear everything around them. Through this heightened sensory perception, they will turn on each other, killing and destroying everything in their wake for self-preservation. When a horse appears to breath fire in the mind of one's drugged eyes, how can he be blamed for wanting to take action against a monster? This plan is intertwined between the streets, the bought and sold government, and outside forces finding their way into the city. Manufactured by psychiatrist Jonathan Crane, this toxin is used to make people insane, thus locking them in his Arkham Asylum for experimentation and silencing of whatever nefarious information they may know. He works for the crime boss Carmine Falcone yet someone higher up on the food chain is really pulling the strings. And while all this is going on, Bruce must also battle the fact that he has returned home to a company slowly slipping through his fingers. The men he needs are being let go and those he can't trust are turning the business over to the public domain. In order to keep his split life complete with whatever he may need, at no risk from anyone asking questions, something must be done.While the villainy may be lacking in scope, you have to be able to forgive the film. It is chock full of so many characters and relationships that need to be fleshed out. You almost have to give it credit for the amount of time it allocates towards those means because of all the groundwork necessary to be laid out for the subsequent films. We are given the relationship between Bruce and his parents, the complicated bond between he and childhood sweetheart Rachel Dawes, he and Alfred his confidant, the introduction of policeman Jim Gordon and other allies such as Luscious Fox, not to mention the multiple villains molding the way for future evildoers to show faceThe Joker anyone? Credit must go to the stellar acting for making it all work. Christian Bale was inspired casting to perfection. He may scowl too much under the mask, but his charisma and physique help lend credibility to the dual role, showing how he can be successful at both lives without pause. Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman are true professionals and play their respective roles of Alfred and Fox to the letter; Gary Oldman is a chameleon given a bit less than hoped as Gordon, by the script, yet paving the way for the next installments; and even Katie Holmes as Dawes doesn't do as bad a job as I initially thought at first glance, although I won't be shedding any tears watching her replacement in The Dark Knight.The villains are also well portrayed for the most part. If you can get past Tom Wilkinson's horridly hammy accent, he gets the role down pretty good. Ken Wantanabe does well in a mysterious performance only enhancing the mystique behind his Ra's Al Ghul and Cillian Murphy is creepiness personified. When Murphy must go into his own insanity and don the Scarecrow mask, he is a force to be fearedparents be warned if bringing in small children. And lastly comes Liam Neeson. As he showed in The Phantom Menace, who better to be the sage teacher, bestowing education onto the minds of those that will sponge it up completely. When that voice is heard, you stop what you're doing and listen fully.Batman Begins gets everything it needs right, bringing up the slack of those moments when it doesn't quite succeed. I hope that in the next film we will be treated to some more choreographed fight sequences as opposed to the quick cut, chopped up ones here. The clarity is there and the action is intense, but it's all just flashes and movement. If you are going to instill this fantasy tale with realism, there should be some long take battles a la the Bourne Series, something to make those in the audience salivate at the craft and precision that went into it all. If the standalone tale is somewhat slight, the exposition and history is definitely not. Once the final credits role, you will know without a doubt who Bruce Wayne is and why he does what he does. Now that all the backstory is explained, we can be treated to the next chapter unencumbered by the need to learn. This time we can just go for the ride and see where Nolan decides to take us next. I for one can't wait.",9,2,2,7 July 2008
Twilight," I don't have the strength to stay away from you anymore  Twilight
","For some reason, vampires are making a huge comeback and while the youngsters can't watch the swearing and nudity featured with Sookie Stackhouse, they can swoon over Edward Cullen and wish to be Bella Swan. And unfortunately, (or maybe fortunately in a purely entertaining, surreal way), the girls at my screening did just that  shrieking as the title came on screen, clapping and whispering characters' names once they appeared, and actually having panic attacks when young Robert Pattinson finally graced us with his presence. How can one not enjoy experiencing a phenomenon such as this first-hand, especially when he didn't know it was part of our youth's lexicon, let alone this big a chunk? I honestly never heard of Stephenie Meyer's series until the marketing machine started churning out the trailer for the film. Well, while it is no southern belle macabre tale as I've grown to love every Sunday night on 'True Blood', Twilight definitely is something. What that something is, I can't quite grasp yet, however, I will say this  it wasn't that bad.One can definitely see why the tweeners love the vampire tales so much. It glorifies the life of an immortal, vaulting it to the status of godlike and virtuous. I mean, we are dealing with 'vegetarian' vamps herethey have stifled their thirst by drinking only the blood of animals, thus allowing them to integrate with society, playing human yet never revealing their true identities, (sound like manufactured Tru Blood for mainstreaming vamps? It does to me). Now don't get me wrong, I am sure these two literature sagas have nothing to do with each other, but it is an intriguing correlation considering they have come into the mainstream almost simultaneously. But Twilight has something on the scale of godlike itselflegions of adoring fans, young teen girls that will do anything in order to have their parents quench the bloodlust for a glimpse at this world, one they dream of living in, to find their own hottie vampire able to save their lives whenever necessary.No one would have been surprised if Hollywood, needing to market this thing to the greatest common denominator, took the tale and made it about good versus evil, the kind immortals against the evil ones. But that would have been too easy and above all else, unnecessary. The millions of people around the world, (yes, it's been translated in over 20 different languages), wouldn't have stood for anything less than the love story they have grown to adore. It is about Bella and Edward finding each other and becoming the perfect couple in Forks, Washington. Differences aside, catering predilections forgotten, these two kids truly love each other despite the reality knocking at the door telling them they should get as far from each other as possible. There is just enough conflict, just enough of a taste for the vampire feuds and dormant rivalry with the Native Americans in the regiona none to subtle foreshadowing of werewolvesto keep your interest and not hurt the romance holding it all together.I'll admit that I bought into the relationship completely. Kristen Stewart and Pattinson work together as a couple with all the awkwardness of teenagers. I acquiesced to the strange courtship and eccentricity of it all because here is a man afraid of what he might do to his love. It may come across as comical because of the slowness of it allthe overlong anticipation for that first kissbut it is actually completely serious. Edward needs to know for sure that the kiss won't turn into a bite, giving him the taste of blood that he won't be strong enough to fight against. With that said, there is a lot to chuckle about here. The romantic moments may play unintentionally funny, but the rest of the movie is very much intentionally unintentionally funny. That's correct; wrap your head around what I just said. It's not 'so bad it's good' it's 'we want you to laugh, but we are going to pretend we don't, so whether you think we did or not, your laughing or lack of will both be justified'. Yes, they pander to us, hoping that whatever our reaction is, that's the reaction we are supposed to have.But you know what? I loved the humor. What new kid in school gets the kind of welcome that Bella gets here? Most films will have stuff thrown at her, the cliques laughing and calling her names, only the geeks giving her the time of day because finally they aren't the butt of the jokes. Instead, Meyer has made these kids love Bella before they even know her. It was the most surreal thing in the world; I thought I was watching a 'Twilight Zone' episode, and maybe, (due to the name), that is exactly what I was supposed to feel. She becomes Miss Popular as soon as she steps foot on school grounds  fantastic. And with the clunky, clichéd one-liners like the title to this review, the lion and lamb metaphor, and Billy Black's 'I'm down with the kids', how can you not smile? As for those involved, an admirable job all-around. Hardwicke gets a bad rap sometimes, and it could be justified, but here she does what's needed. Nothing too flashy and because of the inherent campiness that appears to be wanted, the moments that seem cheesy actually work because they play that way. Even the parents, Sarah Clarke and Billy Burke, do well. And who doesn't love that Hardwicke found room for the girl that jumpstarted her career, Nikki Reed. Probably the most intriguing vamp of the bunch, she's not given much here, but hopefully the subsequent entries will beef up her somewhat jealous and spiteful mind. Yes, I believe I might actually see those sequels myself to discover if Edward and Bella can truly live happily ever after.",6,6,14,20 November 2008
Revolutionary Road," It takes real guts to see the hopelessness  Revolutionary Road
","Here it is, the start of suburban sprawl. So many people will look at it as successthe ability to survive and raise a family away from crime, in a neighborhood that thrives on wholesome love and friendship. But as anyone can tell you today, most of that is a complete façade, a mask hiding the troubles and anger and regret that everyone feelsthat need for more, and a way out of the rut of living without living. What Revolutionary Road does is peel back that layer where it concerns the Wheelers, a young couple that is looked up to by everyone in their social circle. Loving, two children, a supporting husband, and a beautiful wifethey're the idyllic white picket fence dream. Except for the inner struggles both Frank and April fight each day, looking at their present and only seeing a future full of mediocrity and safety; the excitement of young love full of hope, where the sky was the limit, all but gone. Once that first child is born, you need to begin living for someone else, putting yourself in the backseat. Sometimes that life just isn't for all of us.The novel for which this film is adapted from is also the material loosely utilized for the television show 'Mad Men'. While these two entities differ greatly, the underlying structural problems about marriage and the meaning of success couldn't be more similar. Sure Jon Hamm's Don Draper is a confident man that buried his past to become the man he thought he wanted to be and Leonardo DiCaprio is a beaten man stuck in a job he hates in order to be the husband he thinks he needs to be, but the end resultbreaking from their vows to add a little excitement and memory of life when all they had to worry about was themselvesis a mirror image of the other. Tightly wound and stressful to no end, Frank and April Wheeler are at a very dangerous crossroads. Finally getting on the other's nerves, beginning to think that maybe their marriage was rushed into after a chance encounter at a party, the relationship has escalated to shouting matches that attempt to get the other to snap first. It is only the hastily hatched plan of moving to Paris, starting anew with that fervor they both fell in love with from the other the first time, that gets them back on track with a glimmer of hope for the future.Business is booming, the computer generation is burgeoning, and money has become the driving force for life. With advertising and sales entrenching themselves into daily routine, people are finding themselves brainwashed to the idea that a perfect home life means having the big house, nice car, multiple children, and dinner on the table each night. If that dream means working a job you don't respect or pretending your life locked inside your house raising the kids who forced you to move to the suburbs in the first place, well, you make do. As my favorite character, and probably the most important voice in the entire film, says, 'most people know the emptiness, it takes real guts to see the hopelessness.' Michael Shannon's John Givings, a friend's son, recently admitted to an insane asylum, hits the nail on the head. Most couples going through the motions know the void they are filling with material goods and lies to themselves and each other, but very few understand the fact that once you find yourself in that world, it becomes a descent into quicksand, almost impossible to find that joy you once saw in front of you so long ago.This man's insanity also plays a huge role in the film due to the fact that, in my opinion, he is the sanest character here. He understands what it means to be free from the constraints of society, but for some reason humanity got lost on its journey, eventually deeming freedom to be an unattainable dream. To live without inhibitions is insanity while slaving away every last fiber of your being becomes the sane thing to do. This fact is shown completely naked through the eyes of DiCaprio's Frank and Kate Winslet's powerful turn as April. By discovering how much what she does hurts her, how much what her contemporaries say she should be doing destroys her will to go on, she slowly finds herself spiraling into depression, becoming vacant and hysterical. The final act, John Givings' last visit to the Wheeler house until the next morning's surreally off-kilter mood and action, is absolutely devastating to experience. You can't help but see yourself in their shoes, watching as the weight of conformity finally becomes too much to prop above the necessity to fly.And Sam Mendes really gets every bit right, even those heavily debated subjects some people might not want to face. At first, I began to think how much could have been improved if say Todd Field directed this story, but after further thought realized it wouldn't have been as effective. While it doesn't contain the amount of humor the audience I saw it with thought, there are a lot of laughs included, both adding to the awkwardness of some situations and deflecting from the sheer dramatic gravitas portrayed at many moments. I especially loved the moments where Mendes slowed the camera down, just a bit, and superimposed a beautiful orchestral score above while muting the sounds of the actions on screen. Utilized when April and Shep dance at a bar and later during Frank's heart-wrenching experience of being completely helpless, this effect is successful and never heavy-handed. Sometimes it takes tragedy to wake yourself from the nightmare of solitude that you thought was a dream of happiness, and Revolutionary Road puts that revelation in your face, hopefully to watch now so as not to allow it to occur to yourself in real life.",10,3,7,13 January 2009
28 Days Later...," That was longer than a heartbeat28 Days Later
","In anticipation for the sequel 28 Weeks Later, I decided to revisit the superb zombie entry 28 Days Later from director Danny Boyle. I remember back to when I first started hearing the buzz about this film and how surprised I was that it came from the guy who brought us Trainspotting and A Life Less Ordinary. However, because this was the guy who made those films, I decided to give it a try, as I am not the hugest fan of the zombie flick or even horror in general. As far as these films go, though, 28 Days Later has got to be my favorite entry to the genre. It could be that there is an actual story involved and an intelligence that is usually lacking in favor of gore and sex, or it could be that this film isn't really very much a zombie film per se at all. The movie is not about humanity surviving against a race of undead beings, but instead about man fighting man, as they always have. The only thing these infected beings bring to the forefront is that rage inside us all, on the surface and unable to be suppressed behind a falsely neutral façade.Our zombies here are not dead and living to kill. The victims have been infected by a virus, which makes pure rage takeover their bodies. One does not need to be dead in order to become a zombie; all that is needed is a drop of blood or saliva to enter the bloodstream. Whether through a cut, your mouth, your eye, or any other exposed orifice, one tiny drop is all it takes for you to crave murder and flesh. Thankfully some people have stayed behind in England to survive and try to find others who have luckily escaped exposure. Our heroes are than common people striving to get through the horror that is happening all around them. Cillian Murphy plays our lead protagonist, helping out his new cynical friend Selena (played realistically by Naomie Harris who has been seeing more and more roles since), yet holding on to his feelings of compassion and needing to help others. Selena is very in the open about her own survival and the fact that when push comes to shove, it is her neck she will save. Murphy's character Jim tries to bring a bit of humanity back to her, tries to subvert the carnage she has seen that has darkened her soul. I believe this is the true crux of the story right herewhat is the point of saving humanity from extinction if you can't see the invaluable worth of the life of those around you?You cannot survive alone. This moral comes up often in the film and really drives it during the numerous stretches without zombies. True, the action scenes are completely riveting throughout, the quick paced editing and sharp movements of blood and violence are harrowing to watch, and the chase scene in the tunnel while trying to change a flat tire gets the pulse running high. However, it's the quiet points really allow the story to mean something with the viewer. The relationship between Brendan Gleeson's father and Megan Burns' daughter are heartbreaking moments. They are only alive because they have each other, someone to love and survive with within the growing isolation and loneliness surrounding them. Their bond shows what living is about and helps break the harsh façade Harris' character has built up to cope. Each does their hardest to never give up hope and their emotions run high at times, but also have show lapses of joy and happiness to counteract it all. I love the scene at the supermarket when they go shopping for food. Gleeson's rant about good wine and his leaving the credit card at the end brought a much- needed smile to my face and totally entrenched my attention into what would soon happen afterwards.It is the end that brings up the political connotations of what has happened and the necessities of life. Whereas most zombie films end with the military coming in and saving everyone from death, here Boyle subverts that into a more telling truthcynical yes, but true nonetheless. These army men, led by a fantastic role of duality from Christopher Eccleston, have created a bunker to try and rebuild society with. Their answer to the zombies is to arm themselves and make a life inside their quarantined home. This is a military state, however, and a utilitarian one. In order to recreate society you need procreation to keep the generations going. With only two female characters in the movie, you can imagine where this goes.Sure the ending becomes a bit too much like your run of the mill actioner, but overall, one cannot ask for more from it. You learn what it is to survive and that you need to have a reason to live and someone to live with. Murphy and Harris deliver the goods during their fight to get out of their island prison. You see, as we later find out, the virus has been contained on the island. England has been quarantined from the rest of the world and sacrificed in order for society to continue on unfettered. The infected are dying of starvation, and salvation seems to have finally come. Now if that doesn't scream sequel, I don't know what does. Hopefully Boyle's producing credit on the follow-up will mean quality and a keeping of tone as well as meaning from this well-done original.",8,0,1,13 May 2007
Lawrence of Arabia," Nothing is writtenLawrence of Arabia
","Lawrence of Arabia is oftentimes listed as one of the greatest films of all time. Not only that, but many say Peter O'Toole's performance as T.E. Lawrence is the greatest piece of acting ever to be captured on screen as well. Being that the movie was made 45 years ago, I wasn't going into it thinking I would agree with either statement necessarily. Whether the four hour run time was too daunting to get my hopes up or not, I knew that no matter what, I needed to finally see this film. I was going to go for the ride from Cairo to the Middle East along with the band of Arab tribes trying to take back their land from the Turks.On a technical level, Lawrence of Arabia has few equals. Director David Lean has created something with true epic focus. There are no advanced computer graphics multiplying fake people into huge battle scenes, this had to be done with real extras, sweltering in the desert heat waiting for their opportunity to fight amongst the movie's stars. The scope is wide and Lean is never afraid to show the desert as a desolate wasteland because the shots are beautiful to behold. The British didn't understand what Lawrence saw in the sand, but viewing the landscape shots here, the audience can see the tranquility and beauty that it truly holds. This was a big-budget movie and it shows by the settings besides the desert. When we arrive in Cairo and see the excess with which the soldiers live; its affluence is on display. Not only by the material objects, but also by the soldiers' utter ambivalence to the fight while their Arab counterparts are trekking through the sun-ravaged desert to claim victory.It is this juxtaposition between the British forces and Arab fighters that backbone the film. Yes, T.E. Lawrence is the focal point and his journey from army outcast to Arab liberator is the story arc we follow, but it is the fact that he tries to live in both worlds which really defines the course of actions on display. Credit does have to go to Peter O'Toole for his ability to grow his character throughout and display the emotion and conflict living inside him. Lawrence saw an opportunity to help the Arab tribes regain control of their land despite Britain's refusal to give them artillery. Even at this early moment, he might have suspected this lack of true support as a sign of future motives, but he was so focused on his cause and the fact that he could do anything he set his mind to, he just didn't care. When he finally succeeds with his first mission, he returns a broken man, having killed and seen things he never wanted to see. He knew it was all for the best, though, and needed to stick by his word of setting his new friends into a free land. Only when the men at Cairo, who once laughed at his expense, praise him with accolades and promotions does Lawrence first start becoming a man without a clear purpose. A man that was accepted by no one now finds himself loved by two distinct cultures, and must somehow cope with the success or eventually fall as a result.Besides the excellent performance by O'Tooleintense, sarcastically humorous, and heartbreakingly real throughoutwe are also treated to an acting clinic from the supporting players. Omar Sharif is fantastic as the Arab Sheriff Ali who agrees to accompany Lawrence on his suicide mission to take a Turkish outpost. Sharif gives Ali a realistic progression from a man who cannot see a white man surviving anything in their future, to one who would follow Lawrence into Hell if asked. Anthony Quinn is also great as Auda abu Tayi, a leader of a tribe that can be bought by whoever offers most. His interactions with O'Toole are some of the best moments in the film because Lawrence always knows what to say to persuade Auda into doing something for his own interests and not for monetary gain, (although he still likes to take something as a souvenir for his troubles). Even Alec Guinness brings an effective performance despite playing an Arab Prince. There are many moments where the allusions to his later Obi-Wan Kenobi character come through making me smile, but the accent is hidden nicely into a British educated Arab speech that helps me forget he is as much an Englishmen as O'Toole is Irish.In the end, however, it is the story which truly leaves a mark. During the runtime, I was slowly seeing some redundancies and wondering if an hour could have easily been chopped off without a second glance. Disappointment was setting in and I was thinking I might have to give it a 7 or 8 rating as a whole. Once the final scenes play out though, you realize why we needed everything that came before. It is Lawrence's success in battle that both leave him broken but also ripe for persuasion into continuing on. The British were looking for a way to have Arabs do the work but eventually swoop in and take the Middle East for themselves, and with Lawrence, they had their man to rally the troops. Lawrence was neither British nor Arab, but instead a man beyond his dreams and ideals. The Arab tribes would never be able to live in harmony for a peaceful unity, and the British were just waiting for the implosion to occur. When all is said and done, Lawrence realizes he is not the God that people, and himself, saw him as, but a pawn that has been played from the beginning. His sanity and drive for good is sucked out of him because while it seemed he was accepted by both worlds, he really didn't belong to either.",9,4,7,23 March 2007
Cars," Cars
","I'm not quite sure why people are speaking of Cars as the worst Pixar movie to date, as being the one that had nothing original to bring to the table. I must totally disagree as I found the film to be highly enjoyable. Besides an overly sappy 'better-days' flashback scored to a James Taylor led song, the film was funny, smart, and amazing to behold graphically. The animation is the best Pixar and Disney has done. Reflections, glares, textures, and materials are as real as possible. Some overhead shots of scenery could have been reality shots with animation characters overlaid, they were that good.The acting was top-notch and the story, with few exceptions, was a winner. Contemporary pop-culture abounded with Larry the Cable Guy's Mater doing his catchphrase 'getter done' and a great cameo by Jeremy Piven doing his best impersonation of his own agent character Ari Gold from HBO's 'Entourage.' I do have to say, however, that the movie was more for the adult crowd than the children. Usually Pixar does a good job of making kid movies with an abundance of jokes that the adult crowd can take with it. With Cars, it was the other way around. While when first hearing of the project, I thought of Hot Wheels cars, we are actually given a real world of automobiles, both recreational and Nascar circuit. With a very poignant almost personal story, we are shown a heartfelt movie with an abundance of broad humor for the kids.Details are what shine in Cars. Besides the brilliant animation of the cars themselves, we are treated with living backgrounds. Little things like the headlight wave in the Nascar crowd and the mountains of classic cars in the desert, (by this I mean mounds in the shape of cars not abandoned cars in mounds), are great to behold. Even the flies shooting around near bright lights are little VW Bugs; everything was taken to the nth degree and that is why it succeeded for me. Other parts to look for are the scared SUV's who've never gone off-road before and the tongue-in-cheek sequence during the credits with John Ratzenberger's Mack Truck. Also, look during the opening sequence of the final race towards the end of the movie. I recall seeing two cars looking over the balcony in the nosebleeds when the camera is panning in to the stadium. The one strangely looked as though it emitted something over the rails, not sure if this was a joke of it spitting over the side, or what; it was definitely intriguing. Stay after the credits as well to see a nice progression in the plot of a couple brief side characters from the middle of the film.",8,0,0,22 July 2006
The Number 23," I think you knowThe Number 23
","Director Joel Schumacher can go from great (Tigerland), to very good (Falling Down), to classic nostalgia (The Lost Boys), to utter garbage (Batman & Robin). When I hear that he has directed something new, I usually begin with a cringe before checking out the new trailer. The Number 23, however, started its advertisement with an interesting premise, great cast, and finally the Schumacher stamp of unknowingness. I didn't care that much, thinking that this could definitely go in the great category and cement a change for the better in his oeuvre, starting with his trilogy of Colin Farrell films to 2004's rock-infused Phantom of the Opera. Unfortunately the film ended up falling flat in many instances. I'm not sure though, how much of that fault lies in the director's hands. The acting is top-notch, the visuals are stunning, and the change in mood from present, fiction, and reality is deftly handled. Maybe the trouble is the average script used, which includes the oldest twist in the book, that couldn't be saved even is Kubrick came back from the dead to take a stab at it.The Number 23 is about a man that becomes obsessed with a book about a detective and his descent into the world of coincidence the number creates. Walter Sparrow, (Jim Carrey), is confused by the many parallels to his own life that the nightcrawler Fingerling has, soon believing the novel was written specifically about him. Sparrow falls deeper and deeper into the number's grasp until he must find out who the author is and see how the story really ends before he becomes Fingerling himself. Schumacher tells the story through three intertwining plot lines: Sparrow's life and reading of the novel, Fingerling's journey through the starkly contrasted film noir world, and the reality of what these two paths crossing means. The transformations our three principle actors make between the environments are stunning and well constructed. Carrey and Virginia Madsen are completely two different people when playing Walter/Fingerling and Agatha/Fabrizia respectively. Besides the lighting and filtering of the film stock (the film noir world is stunning to look at with its over-exposed aesthetic and hard-boiled detective undertones), the performances are complete opposites of each other. Whereas Walter and Agatha live a perfect suburban life, normal jobs and good parenting, Fingerling and Fabrizia are creatures of debauchery and self-confidence, slithering through a land of crime and darkness with one another's sexual company as an escape from it all. Madsen's entrance to a She Wants Revenge song (which I learned was picked by music connoisseur Carrey) is remarkably bold and sets the tone for how different the two worlds really are.While the film had this darkness to it, and you wanted there to be a tragic ending fitting to the mood that had been built up to, you end up getting an exposition scene explaining all the events that transpired along with the most obvious plot twist Hollywood uses almost once a month. It is a real shame that the ending had to be such a whimper compared to the fast-paced, paranoia-infused beginning and middle. The script just didn't seem polished enough or smart enough to take a chance on a conclusion that stuck to what the film as a whole was trying to accomplish, in my opinion at least. You also had the character of Isaac French, (the great Danny Huston), become wasted space. There was so much that could have been done with him to create more tension between the Sparrows with his 'is he cheating with the wife or isn't he?' thread. The alter ego Dr. Phoenix was, however, a delight, no matter how brief he was actually on screen. With a little more time and fine-tuning, this film could have been very enjoyable, but instead it ultimately ends up being a nicely acted and shot, mediocre thriller.",6,1,4,25 February 2007
The Lives of Others," The 40th Anniversary PlayThe Lives of Others
","Many people were startled by the fact that Pan's Labyrinth lost the Best Foreign Film Oscar to its fellow nominee The Lives of Others. Granted, many hadn't seen the German film yet, however, I think the push that the Spanish fantasy had, while also taking a few technical Oscars in the process, surprised a lot of people. The shock led to numerous movie folk on the internet describing the voting process for that award, how a select group, not the entire Academy, screens the foreign films. Therefore many thought that this more dramatic and adult story was chosen because that group was probably a very pretentious bunch and couldn't in their right mind vote a fantasy film as a winner above it. Whether this is true or not, Buffalo now has the opportunity to see the award winning film for itself, to decide if it was deserving or not. I must say, while I don't think it was better than Pan's I am totally fine with the fact that it won. The Lives of Others is an expertly told thriller, tense throughout, as we never quite know what our protagonist or antagonist will do, or even if they are on opposite sides of the movie's coin to begin with.We begin the movie with an introduction to Hauptmann Wiesler, (played perfectly by Ulrich Mühe, who you might know from Haneke's original Funny Games), a member of the Stasi who is teaching a class on the tactics of an interrogation, and how you must show no remorse when trying to find out enemies to the State. An old friend of his, who has since risen in the ranks of the government faction more for greed than actually wanting to do right by his superiors, tells him about a new surveillance job that has come up straight from the Minister himself. Wiesler, always a man willing to do what is necessary for the cause he believes in, takes the job and begins watching the accused man's every move. Soon, though, he realizes that this man, while having friends of those with Western loyalties, keeps clean himself when it comes to politics of that persuasion. Instead Wiesler finds that his subject's live-in girlfriend is having an affair, with the Minister no less. This is not a stakeout to find an enemy; his assignment is one to get rid of a man so that his superior may have a woman all to himself. Disillusionment sets in and Wiesler begins to put a series of events into place that only he knows what he wants the result to be. Does he want to punish the Minister for using his power for selfish gains? Or does he want to prove to everyone that he knows what his job is and will show everyone the power he himself wields.There are some really fantastic moments throughout the film showing the eventually demise of the GDR. Mühe is fantastic as Wiesler and shows his changing opinions and confusion in what it is he is does for the Stasi. What was once a job for the continuation of socialism in East Germany has become a tool of the leaders to use against their people. When Wiesler and his boss friend go to lunch and he sits at a table of lesser rank than his own, his friend says how the captains sit in the back. Wiesler's response of how socialism must start somewhere is so true and biting that his friend can only smirk. These leaders no longer work for the common good of all men, they have received power and they now intend to keep it. From this point on you never can tell which side Wiesler is truly working on.Mühe is not the only great performance of the film, although his calm stoicism and hidden emotion truly carry it. The subject of his mission, Georg Dreyman, a playwright, is wonderfully done by Sebastian Koch. This role is of a man who has seen his politically outspoken friends be punished for voicing their opinions, and has, as a result, decided to not follow suit. Only when his mentor commits suicide does Dreyman finally decide to do something about the stifling regime in power and help the West see the growing dissent in the East. His girlfriend, actress Christa-Maria Sieland, is also portrayed with raw emotion by Martina Gedeck. She is caught between love and survival and has gotten herself too deep in both to be able to leave one for the other. Her part is hard to watch because she tries so hard to keep both halves of her life living in harmony, but being too tired and broken to keep the charade going.I will again say that I really enjoyed this film. The story was intelligently told and professionally acted and directed. I was on the edge of my seat throughout, waiting to see what Wiesler's true intentions were. If the film would have ended at its logical finishing mark, I may have put it in my top ten of 2007. However, what was a fascinating tale of two men slowly realizing their beliefs were incorrect and because of which decide to take the dangerous challenge of doing something about it, becomes a history lesson about the fall of the Berlin Wall. It was the concentrated focus that enthralled me, and once a series of epilogues (2 years later, etc) were tacked on the end, I was totally taken out of the intimacy of the movie. The final shot ends up being so clichéd and safe that, while appropriate, it ends up subverting the rest of the movie's keep-you-guessing mentality. Some things are best left up to the audience's imagination, and a final crossing of paths between the watcher and the subject need not be spelled out.",8,5,8,18 March 2007
Hellboy," She took his picture  Hellboy
","You gotta love Guillermo del Toro. The man knows how to play the system, staggering his Spanish language tales of wonderment with the oft-Hollywood big-budget action flick. The beauty of it is, however, that del Toro never compromises his vision when tackling a comic book adaptation. Looking at a film like Blade II shows that he carries his style with him wherever he goes, improving on a pretty solid first installment and showing that he can handle the work. That film helped land him the duties of helming HellboyI'm surea film with flair, humor, action, and style. Anyone else could have phoned a film like this in for the paycheck, biding time until his next passion project came down the pipeline, but with del Toro, this adaptation was just as important in his oeuvre as any other, and it shows.With an almost perfect mix of exposition, character development, and plot, this tale of a demon coming to Earth from a portal to Hell, only to be raised by a scientist into the ultimate fighter against evil, fires on all cylinders. Concise in its originnot quite a flashback since it's the first thing we seewe learn where the titular character comes from, who brings him here, and for what purpose. This is the all-encompassing larger plot line that will inevitably be carried on throughout the series, a demon fighting for good against the powers that spawned him. The ultimate cautionary tale of nature vs. nurture, Hellboy may be sarcastic, cranky, and abrasive, but he knows his role and revels in the fact that he saves lives on a daily basis. I always seem to connect more with the heroes that don't necessarily have powers. True he does, but only those abilities common to his kind. He is a demon and thus does demon things, much like Superman who is Kryptonian, (he doesn't have superhuman abilities, he isn't human), and Batman, who uses inventions and skill to battle villainy. These heroes use what God gave them and nothing else; no mutations or radiations make them different, life does, and they are doing the best they can, attempting to assimilate and be seen as normal.What really works here is the way that character relationships are developed as the plot continues on. Rather than everyone have a set bond that we must become privy to, they all kind of start apart from one another. Hellboy and his father Prof. Broom are at odds, he and his friend Liz are separated by a sanitarium, Abe Sapien is detached by his glass water tank, and newcomer John Myers has only just met them all. Connections are repaired and newly created before our eyes while the fights rage on. It is the fieldwork by this secretive government group against evil that brings them all together. Unfortunately, as a result, this also means that the plot to save Earth is a tad undercooked. Sure the action scenes are great, especially involving our Nazi timeclock, knife-welding friend, but the overall story really just shows whether Hellboy will stay good or go to the dark side. The only true peril Earth faces is in the off-chance he decides to follow his destiny as ruler of our dimension, a simple no could pretty much quash all the trouble faced here. But this was always to be the first of at least a trilogy, setting up motivations and tone, and for that you can't fault the film one iota.To complement it all is some fine acting from the large cast. John Hurt has made a living in his later life playing the sage mentors and he does so again here; Selma Blair stays true to her filmography as well playing the troubled youth trying to find herself while also helping her friends discover themselves; and Jeffrey Tambor adds wonderful jabs of wit and humor every time he graces the screen. Even Karel Roden as the evil Rasputin continues in the type of villainy he is recognized for. A stalwart at playing the stone-faced maniac, he is truly terrifying as he just carries on, back from the dead after 50 years, as though it's the next day and another opportunity to make Herr Hitler proud. The true star, though, is unquestionably Ron Perlman as our red hero. He excels at the sardonic rhetoric, chomping on his cigar as he cuts down those around him with words. A truly troubled soul, Perlman has full range of his facial features under the massive amount of makeup and portrays every emotion needed to realize the role. Credit the filmmakers for utilizing costumes that never hindered any performances.And one couldn't end without talking of del Toro's vision. Straight off we are graced with a vortex opening out into space and the Seven Gods of Hell awaiting their rebirth. The Sammael creatures are well-fleshed out, and the multitudes of squid-like monsters also. The art direction is superb with only a couple blemishes of illusion showing through, (Hellboy's crunching of a Red Bull can and numerous instances of bodies being thrown about, among others). It is with the fire from Blair's character that I was most impressed with. The blue flames encompassing her entire body and all that surrounds her was very realistic and cool to boot. Just viewing the trailers for the sequel Hellboy II: The Golden Army shows that del Toro has upped the ante on fantastical beings. I can't wait to see what happens now that we can delve into the story from start to finish and check out whether the world can be saved from outside forces rather than the fragile psyche of our hero, although I'm sure that will play into it as well.",7,1,2,10 July 2008
Across the Universe," TIFF07, review 2: Either learn French or dieAcross the Universe
","Julie Taymor's film Across the Universe has been high up on my most anticipated list for a year now. Taking classic and lesser-known Beatles' tunes, she has crafted a contemporary musical about a group of young adults at the turning point of life during the start of the Vietnam War. While highly ambitious and oftentimes gorgeous to behold, the film ultimately ends up being a failed attempt at genius. Visually stunning, almost every sequence assaults your eyes with beauty and unique splendor. Unfortunately, Taymor may have fallen victim to excess. Trying to jampack every character ever used in their music becomes overkill, adding scenes that add nothing to the story but a way to add more songs.By gleaning each name she could use as a character, Taymor finishes with mixed results. While it worked for Lucy, an effective Evan Rachel Wood; Jude, relative newcomer Jim Sturgess in a great turn as our lead; and Max, Joe Anderson with the best performance of the film, it was too strained for others like Mr. Kite and Dr. Roberts. Sure Bono is fantastic as the psychedelic Roberts, but his sole purpose in the movie is to get the crew over to Kite, who, while played nicely by Eddie Izzard, is totally unnecessary in the grand scheme of things. Along with these moments is a scene that introduces Martin Luther McCoy as JoJo, a guitar player getting away from the tragedies at home. A perfect example of how uneven the film is, this sequence involves a pimp and his whores singing along to 'Come Together.' Sure the choreography is great, but the pimp is just plain awkward staring into the camera with a stoic face as JoJo keeps walking away. It isn't all a waste, though, because the moment when he walks down the street, through a mob of clone-like worker bees, is fantastic to behold. How she could ruin moments of shear brilliance with those of gaudy frivolities is beyond me. Even when taking the lyrics literally with 'I Want You (She's so Heavy)' comes a number that is truly stunning. Having Uncle Sam hijack Max's life, culminating into the troops carrying the Statue of Liberty is somewhat breathtaking if not entirely heavy-handed.It is also this anti-war imagery that causes a bit of a problem. If Taymor kept with the strict stance throughout, I wouldn't have minded so much. A film can go against my beliefs on subjects as long as it is honest with it's own motives. What goes wrong here is the fact that we are allowed a glimpse into a single moment with Lucy and her reactionary boss that completely subverts the peace over violence mantra. By allowing such an easy scene just squeeze in so that the story can smoothly transition into the eventual climax is both lazy and hypocritical. The emotions and viewpoints that Lucy and Jude hold so close to their hearts are too easily changed, but I guess all you need is love.Right from the start we experience what is in store. After our entry-point with Jude on the beach, introducing Lucy's charactervery reminiscent of Ewan MacGregor's opening from Moulin Rouge!comes a lovely collaged montage of waves rumbling over scenes to occur later on in the film. These waves are layered with newspaper clippings helping to give an overview of the political barometer of the time period. After this is a nice juxtaposition of Lucy, Jude, and Prudence's lives as they start their journey in their hometowns, ultimately bringing them together in New York City. It is the event that begins JoJo's trek that solidified my enthrallment into the film and eased me into a wondering at what could happen next. Unfortunately, the scene of prostitutes follows and jarred me out of my trance, making me conscious of the horrible along with the beautiful.All the acting is above average, if not superb, and the set pieces meticulously orchestrated. Despite the seemingly shoddy CGI work at times, especially during an underwater/above the water sequence, the visuals are spectacular. Julie Taymor needs credit for the imagination and fearless mentality to even attempt what she has. Before the film, she spoke about how Evan Rachel Wood was 17 at the time they filmed. Turning 20 a few days ago, the movie finally sees the light of day. A lot of work went into the final project and it shows. It is just a shame that the film's ambitions outweigh what actually shows up on screena whole that doesn't succeed past the sum of its parts. In the end, even though a disappointment in overall execution, those parts that work are a sight to behold and highly worth experiencing on the big screen, especially having the opportunity to see the world premiere at the Toronto Film Festival.",7,10,24,13 September 2007
The Mist," You're all right Big BillThe Mist
","I always say to people that Frank Darabont is the only man who can truly make a great Stephen King adaptation. I'm not so sure I have the credentials to state that as fact, but I do anyways. I love The Shawshank Redemption, but never read Rita Hayworth and I read The Green Mile, but still have yet to watch the film. So, I can't quite compare his work with that of the author, however, that did little to temper my anticipation for his first based on a supernatural story, with The Mist. Early buzz was that he completed the hat trick; even with some unavoidable clichés inherent to the genre, he was able to create something unique and terrifying. I have to say that I agree whole-heartedly. The tale that he has spun and the performances that he has wrenched from his actors are nothing short of spectacular. With the amount of tension built up, you hardly have time to notice the somewhat mediocre effects work and token moments of horror tradition. Whereas someone less capable would have tried to tell the tale of humanity versus the otherworldly beasts outside their grocery store cage, Darabont tells it how it really isfear of the unknown turning man against man. There is no scarier monster than the one hidden inside us all.We aren't given very much background at all. Thrown into the plot by a huge storm knocking power out and leaving destruction in its wake, we don't have much time before we are taken to the grocery store that becomes our setting for almost the entire duration. These are not two-dimensional characters, though, and through their conversations with each other, we glean a lot about who they are. It helps that this is a small town where everyone knows everyone, and they all make sure each other knows it. You have to love the old retired teacher calling you an underachiever right before you go out to risk your life against creatures straight from another dimension. The occupations of everyone plays into the plot course too, from a movie poster artist trying to tell the group that he saw tentacles attempting to take them out into the mist, to a lawyer doing his best to see the practicality of the situation and necessity of evidence before being convinced. They all have one thing in common, though, and that is the need for protection, the need for a herd to follow. As Armageddon plays out on the other side of the glass windows, fear takes hold, pitting faith against rationality, morality opposite ceremonial sacrifice.Darabont has his cinematographer stay in very close throughout the movie. With extremely tight compositions, we are able to see the emotions and the chaos reflected by each actor's eyes. Everyone handles the pressure differently and the filmmakers don't cop-out from showing us each. The feeling leads to some claustrophobic moments, but also some wonderful action pieces, showing us the brutality and violence up close with no question or ambiguity to what happened. Towards the end, we are given a witch-hunt sequence between the zealots and the pragmatists. It is just a breathtaking piece of cinematic splendor, beautifully orchestrated despite its cruel subject matter and unabashed frankness. If you want to see grotesque, remorseless creatures, just take a glimpse at your neighbor. I'm sure it is there just below the surface, waiting for an opportunity to come up for air and latch onto the coattails of the nearest person crazy enough to think they know the answers and that they alone can lead the rest to salvation.The acting is simply phenomenal. An ensemble of so many recognizable faces has been compiled and no one misses a step. Thomas Jane is devastating as the father of a young boy doing his best to keep everyone calm while taking stock of the situation in an attempt to find a way out; Toby Jones gives a nice turn as the slightly nerdy store assistant manager who is constantly walked on until his true worth is shown; and Andre Braugher is effective as the foil to Jane, their rocky relationship evolving and devolving as each minute goes by. While everyone is fantastic, it is Marica Gay Harden that becomes the real tour de force. I have never been a huge fan of hers; she is solid for sure, but usually comes off as annoying to me. Here, though, she is the most frightening character on screen. Channeling God's wishes through her demented skull leads to the separation into two factions of the survivors. If this wasn't a genre flick I'd say she had a pretty decent shot at getting her second supporting actress Oscar.Every note is played to perfection. Overcoming any crutches that the nature of horror/thrillers bring with them, Darabont has crafted an emotionally draining piece of cinema that leaves the audience gasping for air as though they have been kicked in the stomach. While the fights with the bug-like creatures are effective, they only play out as the first step to the battles within soon to come. I credit all involved for keeping the tone where it needed to be in order for success. This is an R-rated tale and it pulls no punches to that effect. Whereas most films of this ilk would take a simple route out of the carnage, we are allowed to watch all play out to its unavoidable end. Maybe the finale is obvious, but evenso, it is stripped down to the basic core of emotions. I knew it was coming yet it was still devastating to experience. Fear makes us all do that which we think we could never do and, if anything, The Mist is a cautionary tale to help us remember that one crucial and unbending fact of life.",8,239,408,23 November 2007
Stardust," Mind you don't wear out the wenchStardust
","A magical adventure is just what the summer needed to usher the season into its closing months, leading up to the award contenders' fall/winter releases. With all the sequels and over-the-top action and special effects heavy drivel, an intelligent story steeped in originality couldn't come at a better time. Neil Gaiman and Charles Vess's fantasy story Stardust is a tale ripe for cinematic translation. With the adventure, the surreal, the action, the romance, and the comedy, this film is a direct descendant of classics in the genre like The Princess Bride. After walking out of the theatre, I only had one regretthat I hadn't the opportunity to open up my newly purchased 2007 hardcover edition of the novel yet. If the film was this enjoyable throughout its entirety, I can't wait to check out the source material.I don't want to ruin any story/plot lines in this review. There is a lot going on and many characters to contend with. Rest assured, everyone's motives are clearly laid out and no one seems two-dimensional or a waste of space. Even the small parts, which crop up at many instances throughout, have fleshed out roles, integral to the story thread that they are a part of. Nothing happens without a reason or regard for some future event. Between the journey of a boy for a fallen star to win his love back at home, the quest for the ruby stone that will crown a prince king, the mission for eternal life by a sisterhood of witches, and the story of a boy becoming a man and finding the true meaning of love and sacrifice, Stardust literally has it all. Fate is a big factor with the progression of our characters as an incident that happened eighteen years previous started a chain reaction of events leading to where we begin our tale with young Tristran. All our heroes and villains continue down the same paths, hot on the heels of each other or narrowly missing confrontation at every turn. The magical land of Stormhold is very near our very own England. Only those with the courage to seek out adventure will dare cross over to see what the other side holds.We are treated to a plethora of quirky folk along the journey of Tristran and Yvaine. They soon find out what trouble lies in store for them and, with the help of others, attempt to stay alive so that they can each get back to their respective homes. Charlie Cox is fantastic as our hero with equal parts shyness and bravery. His transformation along the duration of the movie is realistic and he handles the romantic moments with the same poise as the action sequences. Always with a smile, his awkwardness to the world outside his reality leads to some very humorous moments with great comedic timing on his part. As for our falling star, Claire Danes continues to impress me this year. The girl I couldn't stand has been slowly finding a soft spot with me. She is radiant here, and her smile glows enough so that the filmmakers didn't even need to use the halo effect when she is happy.Fans of British film and television will enjoy seeing the numerous cameos included. No matter the name or the top billing, some of the big stars don't last very long. Either way, though, each does his job fully to create the world we are in. We are given nice turns from Ricky Gervais, Peter O'Toole, and Jason Flemyng along with wonderful brief moments from the likes of Rupert Everett and Mark Heap. Michelle Pfeiffer is fantastic as our main villain, yes, but it is Robert De Niro who truly steals the show. You have no idea what to expect from him in the trailers, and you still don't upon his introduction. However, when his true self comes out, it is absolutely priceless.I never would have thought Matthew Vaughn could create such a lush world of comedy and swashbuckling amongst so many fantastical elements, complete with some very nice computer generated work. This is the guy who produced Guy Ritchie's high violence capers and directed his own harsh crime story in the film Layer Cake. To go from almost directing X-Men 3 to than begin work on a Gaiman fantasy story is quite the leap, but he handles it beautifully. I read that Gaiman actually approached Vaughn because he knew him as an entertainment industry guy that he could trust. Not wanting his words to be altered and disrespected, he met with Vaughn and the two came up with a way to make the film true to the novel while also being palatable for Hollywood to embrace. This is truly a story with a lot of heart and I can't wait to watch it again.",9,3,4,11 August 2007
I Am Legend," Daddy look, a butterflyI Am Legend
","Francis Lawrence had impressed me with his very under-appreciated Constantine and I was somewhat psyched to see what he could do with this material. Based on the novel of same name by Richard Matheson, I Am Legend has the potential to be a great psychological thriller, commenting on man's quest to be God, while instilling some nice scares and monster work. For the most part, Lawrence succeeds on all counts.I will admit to being drawn in completely right from the start. In a film that potentially follows Smith around, alone, for two hours, I was completely taken aback by the introduction. We are shown a television interview between an uncredited Emma Thompson and Ms. Klue from 'Lost'I was not expecting that. Soon enough, though, we are vaulted right into the action, three years later, to the deserted and overgrown city, ground zero for infection/home to our hero Robert Neville. The filmmakers really handle the exposition brilliantly, showing us the day to day routine for our immune scientist spliced together with memories of the final minutes before quarantine with his family. You really do become quite engrossed with the environment and on edge from the subtle hinting of the Dark Seekers (don't you dare call them vampires).Will Smith is a powerhouse here. I don't care what your feelings are towards the man, he truly is good at his craft. As far as making one film a year, he knows how to pick a role that will challenge him into giving his all, whether or not the work itself succeeds. His emotions are always realistic, the relationship with his dog Sam is heartwarming, and the moments showing how cabin fever has set in (talking to mannequins that he has set up strategically throughout the city) help explore the fractured soul he now must carry alone, while also lending some nice comic relief. It was all working so well, everything was methodical and relevant, his quest for finding a cure vastly important. And then, of course, it all fell apart.Showing the enemy, completely made from computer graphics, is one thing, showing them for extended periods of time is another. When shrouded in darkness, the creatures are very effective, when they all of a sudden become conscious and intelligent, they become utterly laughable. Why does the leader have to hold such a dorky smile the whole time? Just be menacing and non-committal; I wanted monsters devoid of humanity. Sure Smith's Neville says they have finally lost all human qualities, but he is wrong. The fact that they have learned to fight back smartly and risk exposure to sunlight in order to catch a glimpse at him shows they have become more human. They are no longer roaming wild for blood lust, now they want to have some fun with personal vendettas. What's more human than that? Even then, the film could have been forgiven, but alas, it tries to tidy everything up with a nice bow on top. Much like Signs, where the minutia of the first three-thirds of the film all of a sudden gain mystical meaning to the point of scripturerectifying allI Am Legend takes its slow burn and turns it into a race for the finish. It is all too quick and way too easily done. If only it was all hinted on throughout, it wouldn't have felt so tacked on. This disappointment, however, makes me want to read my copy of the 1954 novel to see how much was changed. The credits say based on the 1971 screenplay for The Omega Man before they say based on Matheson's book. I won't be surprised if the ending is what was taken from the old film version, the effective character study being what was gleaned from the original source.",6,3,8,14 December 2007
Gran Torino," Why does everyone want my car?  Gran Torino
","Don't get me wrong, I'm a big Clint Eastwood, the director, fan. However, Gran Torino is getting buzz like crazy. It hasn't even opened wide yet and already ranks #184 of all time on IMDb. I'll agree that it is a very good movie, well composed and paced with a fantastic final act; I just can't quite allow myself to call it a masterpiece. As I said, I'm a fan of Eastwood the director, not necessarily Eastwood the actor, and, with his performance here as Walt, I won't be changing that mindset. I found myself laughing more often at his growls and scowls than feeling fear or menace. He isn't the only one at fault, though; I think everyone falls pretty flat acting-wise here. I'll give the Hmong characters some slack being that they aren't trained actors, but instead authentic people from that culture, and kudos to the filmmakers for going that route. As for our lead, the priest (a very uninspired Christopher Carley), and even a couple good actors as Walt's sons in very limited roles, I found their performances detracting from a solid story.What I liked about Gran Torino was its humor. You may be thinking: what is this guy talking about? But honestly, I laughed a lot, and I think it was intentional. The first three-quarters set up the climax to be powerfully dramatic with much deserved weight and as a result needs to have an infusion of levity to keep us off-guard when the bottom finally falls out. I wouldn't be surprised if Clint decided to act as Walt rather than find a better actor because he just wanted to have fun with racial epithetsboy there are plenty. His utter disregard for the opinions of those he insults and his overly tough exterior just make the words funny to me. Many times he is saying these things because that is 'how men talk' with friends. His comradery with folks allow him the freedom to act like a bigot without recourse, (my favorite character in the film being one of these men, John Carroll Lynch's barber, who is involved in a priceless scene with Clint and Bee Vang as Thao), and that lightness makes his under-the-breath tirades become acceptable. Now, they aren't acceptable as far as societal right and wrong, but his character is built to be this Korean War vet, an old and bitter man, so you almost have to give him the benefit of the doubt. In his mind, the country he fought for is now being over-run by those he was ordered to kill. Seeing the denigration of his neighborhood and the utter lack of respect on behalf of the youth, he paints the simple picture that it's all a result of the turning tides of immigration.This humor, I believe, is what makes the ending so effective. Eastwood goes through a transformation from old man that wants to be left alone, to old man that finally has someone he can be a father to. Does it change his attitude or demeanor? Absolutely not. Does Eastwood have the acting range to make that evolution apparent on screen if necessary? Probably not, so let's say it was good that while he softened to the Asians living next door, he never let his guard down  that would have just come off as inauthentic and manipulative. By getting to understand Walt Kowalski's character, however, allows us to believe he would do what he does. Never clicking with his own sons, never being able to be a father to them and listened to for his experiences made him distant to them. Coming into the life of a traditional Hmong family, on-the-other-hand, allows him to finally feel that patriarchal duty. Ahney Her's Sue tells Walt that she wishes her own father were more like him because he was too old-school for a boy like Thao. Walt is confused thinking that he is set in the old ways too, but Sue shows the cultural disparity by saying, 'but you're American'. The customs and way of life are different, and after all these years blaming the Orient for making him into a killer, a sinner, Walt can open his eyes to the humanity they all share.While the gang backdrop really just stands as a way to give Walt a measure of redemption, it is the main catalyst for all that happens in the film. He never would have gotten to know the Lor family if Thao wasn't made to steal his Gran Torino as a gang initiation, and the conclusion never would have happened if the bond between he and Sue and Thao hadn't sprung out from that event. The film is not about the opposition and violence of those street thugs, though, it is about the relationship of Walt and Thao. While the script does wonders at making that friendship work, the acting just doesn't do it justice. Again, I found myself laughing each time Clint scowled at the boyit was just too over the top. And unfortunately for Bee Vang, his delivery came across as staged and reading from a prompter. He is young, though, and inexperienced in acting, so I can't blame him too much. Instead I blame Eastwood, especially in one instance when Vang is locked in the old man's basement, screaming at Clint to let him out. The anger and frustration is so forced that the director should have known when to cut. Yet Eastwood not only shows us the pounding on the door once, but a second time after he comes back into frame to explain what it feels like to kill a man, this time lingering on the boy even longer. It's a moment like this that brings an amateur quality to an otherwise stellar tale, making the sub-par performances overshadow the tightly constructed plot.",7,0,4,3 January 2009
The Hurt Locker," Spoken like a true wild man ... The Hurt Locker
","I was always under the impression that it would be another liberal propaganda-driven message movie like all the others coming out recently. To my great surprise, it was not. Rather than use the war to tell people already against it to protest, Bigelow and screenwriter Mark Boal decide to use Iraq purely as a backdrop to the real subject matter at hand—war itself. Plain and simple, war is hell, but it is also a drug each soldier feeds on, an adrenaline rush that makes him wake every morning to see what may happen. We are thrown into the action as Bravo Company's bomb team has just 38 days left in rotation. Let's just say the day doesn't end well and the final month has its ups and downs showing the world what is going on over there—the pressure, the friendships, the duty, and the loss.The authenticity is astounding throughout. I know people will gripe about the shaky camera style, but that lends itself to the realism and puts you into the action of this bomb squad under the cowboy antics of leader William James, played by Jeremy Renner. He is a recent addition, replacing the team's last technician after a tragic accident involving a bomb and an Iraqi cell phone. It would appear that he has a death wish, going into situations without recon and letting his emotions get the better of him every step of the way. He does have a girlfriend and son back home, though, and the compassion a father has comes out at times, especially when dealing with a young Middle Eastern boy named Beckham selling DVDs and playing soccer. James uses his sense of humor strangely, telling people he'll chop their heads off or some other such nonsense with a straight face before smiling, saying he's just kidding, and rubbing their head. His carefree attitude may seem cavalier, but by the end of the film we will realize what makes him tick. He is doing this for his country, filling a job in high demand with the US army, a job he's damn good at.The other two members of his team don't necessarily share his laidback demeanor. As another soldier says later on in the film, this team is wired tight. Anthony Mackie's JT Sanborn is a by-the-books guy, holding the safety of his men above all else. He is willing to have a good time and can drink, punch, and joke with the best of them, but when it comes to a live bomb out in the middle of a street, he wants you with your radio on, listening to what he has to say. When a surrounding area has been evacuated and he asks James to pull back, letting the engineers take over, he wants to be listened to. Renner's technician is not that kind of guy, though. He sees a puzzle and he wants to solve it, almost admiring the bomb creator whose work he is dismantling. Unafraid to give his Sergeant the finger and continue with his work, headphones and bomb suit off—Specialist Eldridge right next to him in the blast zone being told to fall back by Sanborn but having to stay since James is the commanding officer—he lives for the excitement at the edge of life and death.As for Eldridge, played by Brian Geraghty, who is used to the desert having been in Jarhead, he is a young novice on the team, never having seen a dead body, never having been in a firefight, and yet here he is putting himself in the way of active bombs that could blow him to pieces. A boy that isn't quite able to shake the fear of death, nor the thought that being in Iraq means he already is dead, Eldridge is visited often by a Colonel, who is also a psychiatrist of some sort, helping him through the war. Their relationship ends with devastating effect that resonates from Geraghty's performance despite being an obvious result when watching the sequence leading up to the event. It really is the performance by each of these three leads—Renner, Mackie, and Geraghty—that makes The Hurt Locker as effective a tale as it is. Eldridge may keep his demons on his sleeve throughout, but both James and Sanborn keep theirs hidden until they can no longer. Both do brilliant work at expressing the inner fears and desires, especially those dreams they aren't sure they'll ever be able to fulfill.A lot of credit must be given to Bigelow for getting all the pieces together and crafting a very effective war film. It is character-driven throughout, hinging on the audience believing that these men are in life or death situations each and every day. She opens the film through the eyes of an Army bot, calling to memory the first person filming in—what is my favorite film of hers—Strange Days. And while many will label Bigelow as a man's director, doing action and testosterone-induced work, you can't deny her delicate care in expressing the human psyche. It isn't even just the fight scenes or the high-pressure anticipation of a bomb going off; no my favorite moment is when Renner goes off camp to seek revenge for something he believes occurred. He is alone, without his uniform or equipment and only a sidearm at his disposal, wandering the streets of Iraq. Just the matter in which he has to return to base shows how on edge everyone is. This isn't a video game played by faceless automatons, no, war is most definitely hell. It's being fought, win or lose, by people just like us, full of aspirations and dreams we just hope we'll live long enough to see come to fruition.",9,55,87,30 June 2009
The Illusionist," Where the dark arts still hold swayThe Illusionist
","There is a lot of buzz going around movie circles about this being the year of magic. With Christopher Nolan's The Prestige garnering much anticipation, the lesser-known The Illusionist, by director Neil Burger, hits screens first. Trailers show that while it appears to be the more accurate movie in terms of period and realism, it doesn't seem to have the flash or grave consequence as Nolan's film. While The Prestige is a movie about rivalry and mysticism, The Illusionist is a love story shrouded in trickery and class distinction. We are treated with realistic performances from all the principles, gorgeous cinematography and sleight of hand illusions, yet ultimately are shown a slight story that plods along while entertaining. It is a good film, well worth seeing, yet I have to say it just makes my interest in Nolan's new movie heighten.Edward Norton is a son of a carpenter who worked on the house of a dignitary. This nobleman had a daughter, Sophie, who became smitten with Norton's character. The two want to run away, but their plans are thwarted, as usual in these types of plot lines, by the class disparity; no peasant can be with a noblewoman. We flash forward 15 or so years to Norton's return from exile as Eisenheim the Illusionist in Vienna. His tricks are top-notch and garner the attention of Chief Inspector Uhl, played nicely by Paul Giamatti as a peasant trying to make a name for himself, yet who still knows his role in society. He tells the Prince who comes to see it for himself. Of course the Prince's girlfriend is Sophie, all grown up, and she rediscovers the love that was taken from her once she sees her childhood friend on stage. The film then plays out to show the struggles between the prince and the pauper to see the strength of true love.Norton and Giamatti are both stalwarts of their craft and here is no exception. I think the two actors to mention are Jessica Biel and Rufus Sewell. Biel radiates beauty, yet hasn't really shown anything to warrant top-bill status as far as ability over stardom. As Sophie, she has an innocence and lack of class status that really proves her love for Norton. This isn't your normal wealthy woman who plays with those under her, she truly loves Eisenheim and has during all the years she lost living without him by her side. I was pleasantly surprised by her understated performance, she did what was needed, and maybe took a step in the right direction from fare like her role in the Texas Chainsaw Massacre remake. Sewell on the other hand, shows once more that he is vastly underrated. He plays villainous slime to perfection. The cold stare and palpable malice on his face at times creates true fear. Hopefully one day he will get a chance to shine like he did as the lead in the great Dark City.The real beauty of small films like this is the ensemble casts and overall craftsmanship. Craft almost supersedes acting here, as good as that is itself. Visually, the opening titles are the best I can remember of those seen this year. The focus changing of the old silent film script font is a sight that really immerses the audience into the story. They create a mindframe that we are being transported into a time that has past, a time of real artistry and imagination. Even the early flashback is vignetted in a feathered-edge oval. The magic tricks also are shown realistically with few moments of fake cgi to take you out of the reality. I'm sure the consulting by magician Ricky Jay, a David Mamet stalwart and former castmember of Deadwood, has something to lend to this. It's just a shame that he couldn't crack the cast- list here to as he did with The Prestige.It's too bad that with all of these great things, The Illusionist just didn't have it all. The story is at its core a simple love triangle with magic thrown in. Its almost two hour length seems a bit bloated during the middle portion and unfortunately brings the intrigue down with it. The ending is also obvious, yet because it is pushed so far back from view you almost second- guess the shear necessity of it until it finally happens. Although you know it's coming a mile away, the filmmakers so wanted it to surprise the audience that they wait until the last possible moment to spring it on you. Sadly, this tactic doesn't promote a sense of awe, but instead just makes it feel tacked on as though they couldn't find a way to seamlessly have it happen, so they just unraveled it all at once. It just left me with an empty feeling on an otherwise technically beautiful film.",6,2,5,3 September 2006
Transformers," More than meets the eyeTransformers
","Michael Bay is by no means a director for whom I anticipate each movie of his. The man doesn't do subtlety and he doesn't do intelligent storytelling either. However, you cannot say he doesn't have both artistic vision and deft skill at shooting a film. Sure the guy likes to blow things up, but being able to consistently make work with the amount of preparation and choreography that is necessary, the guy needs some credit. When the idea of a live action Transformers movie was being bandied about with Steven Spielberg's name attached, I will admit I was intrigued while also perplexed by the directing choice. It was only when Spielberg went to the producing side and brought Bay on to helm the action that I finally started to get excited. I knew absolutely nothing about the mythology besides remembering that the toys were cool, but something about Bay, whom I will admit to not being the biggest fan of, just seemed the right fit. After finally experiencing the phenomenon, I will say that I don't think anyone could have done it better, even if the film itself could have been elevated a tad higher.Truthfully, no one is going to see this movie with the hopes of watching a wonderfully written script and emotional progression leading to a top-notch conclusion that both satisfies and ignites conversation. Come on, this is a story about aliens coming to Earth for their 'lifespark' in order to take over the universe. You've got the Decepticons led by Megatron looking to destroy and you have Optimus Prime's Autobots attempting to thwart their attempts. This is all about the effects and the carnage with the slight story playing second fiddle only to allow for more explosions. On this level, the film is very successful and a great time at the theatre. You can't ask for better special effects or fight scenes. The 'transforming' is just awesome to behold and never gets tired as the film goes on, the integration of robots with humans is quite flawless, and the animation bringing the two worlds together is pop art at its best.The real stars here are the Transformers themselves and you really can't fault anything about them. With that said, this movie doesn't happen without its multitude of humans to play off of. For the most part they do an admirable job in keeping the audience's interest enough to not mind waiting until the next big effects sequence happens. Shia LaBeouf uses his sarcastic, nice guy persona to good use like always. I believe he just plays himself in most things, but even if he does, it works. Surprisingly I was impressed by Josh Duhamel who I really look upon as not an actor, but his small role is effectively played, as well as his army compatriot portrayed by the underrated Tyrese Gibson. Heck even Megan Fox manages to be a little more than just eye candy and Jon Voight entertains once you get past the horrid Southern accent.Where the film fails for me is in the campy overtones and corny jokes sprinkled in everywhere. I understand the fight scenes are so big and serious that Bay and company felt they needed some levity to counteract them, but really now. Some of these jokes are so bad and some of these characters are so one-dimensionally hammy that I was shaking my head hoping they would be crushed during the fights. I love both Anthony Anderson and John Turturro, but here they are utterly terrible. The facial reactions are so broad you'd think they are doing silent film and the words and actions of their characters are literally cringe-worthy. People have told me that the camp was prevalent in the original cartoons, so I will cut it some slack. I just think it was so heavy-handed and against the rest of the film that it stuck out like a sore thumb. The quips from LaBeouf worked as did the ones from Amaury Nolasco playing off the army 'heavys' he is with. Bay needs to stick to explosions and realize that he doesn't have the chops to try and make a comedy as well. His pacing in some 'funny' scenes is unforgivable. When the Autobots are destroying LaBeouf's yard, it was laughable the first five minutes. By minute twenty-five you just start yawning.Despite this shortcoming, though, I will say that Transformers is a great experience. You will be blown away by the special effects and computer animation. There is no way you can't be. The live action integration is effective and even the story manages to root itself in enough reality to be somewhat plausible working in a world where alien invaders have come to Earth. A popcorn summer flick through and through, you won't go wrong checking this one out for either a good time or to hop on the nostalgia train of that amazing decade of the 80's.",7,1,6,4 July 2007
Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs," A film by a lot of people  Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs
","I knew right after the above review title quote flashed across the screen that Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs was going to be a fun time. Sony Pictures Animation did not let me down, keeping me enthralled and smiling for the entire duration. Based on a children's book from 1978, the film follows the exploits of a young scientist and his dreams of changing the world with his inventions. Up to adulthood, however, he has achieved little more that a 'menace to society' label from everyone in his small island town of Swallow Falls, where the staple of sardines has become there only source of food now that the world has realized they're gross. Small and subtle jokes such as this statement as a newspaper headline are sprinkled throughout to keep the audience's sense of humor on its toes while the feel-good story in the background continues on, reaching forward to the inevitable nerd-to-hero transformation wherein Flint Lockwood grows up and into his full potential.The invention that becomes the final straw for Flint's disturbing the peace shenanigans is a machine that converts water into food, giving the people of his hometown something to eat besides the overabundance of sardines. Its baptism to the world is a disaster, ruining the mayor's asinine use of government money on a new theme park, soon becoming a happy accident of epic proportions. A malfunction due to too much power—I guess connecting the machine to an electrical tower wasn't the best of ideas—sends it into the atmosphere where it hovers above, taking in the cloud moisture and raining down hamburgers for all to enjoy. Let's not get into details about how that burger will be hot enough to be appetizing because there is a lot more to worry about, such as newfound fame in the community and the world. Flint is the toast of the town and fresh face of newly renamed Chew and Swallow, usurping the monopoly 'Baby' Brent had on the market after posing for sardine tins many years before. Even the cute weather girl intern sent to broadcast it all seems to be falling for him, she herself hiding nerd tendencies and a strong grasp of the scientific beneath her flighty, blonde facade.Mutations are never an exact science and soon the food falling from the sky becomes too large and dangerous to contain. It becomes up to Flint and his friends to risk it all and save the town before the invention—named with a crazy acronym that has about six consonants and one vowel—takes over the world. The mayor wants nothing to change, except his ever-expanding waistband, and in an accidentally villainous role makes things even worse, using the 'like a son' card with the lad, made more meaningful by the lack in ability to express love from his real Dad. So, amidst the chaos, we meet a plethora of kooky characters all voiced by some great comedic actors as they try and help our lead regain control over the one invention that actually works. Well, that statement is a bit harsh considering that everything he's created—from a young elementary student until now—has worked. It's just that they all had minor problems turning that success into hazard or worse. Spray-on shoes is a great concept if you can ever remove them; monkey thought converters would be groundbreaking if a monkey ever could string together more than one loud word at a time, (great Neil Patrick Harris as Steve); and rat-birds would solve  wait, what was he thinking with that one? I did like when one swooped down and snatched a child to which his friends screamed, 'Just play dead!' The animation is really crisp and vibrant, utilizing a cartoony feel rather than a need for realism. Each character is an elongated caricature of a human, adding a sense of style that allows an audience to enter a new world and bask in the creativity. I do kind of wish I had seen it in 3D, though, because multiple instances appear to play to that technology's strengths. There are a few chase sequences that have us following the leads as they run and jump through obstacles flying out at our faces. But, the biggest compliment I can pay to the film is the fact that I enjoyed myself thoroughly without the gimmick. Every joke hits and the story is fun enough to succeed on its own merits. There is definitely something to be said about absurd comedic set pieces existing for the sole purpose to make you laugh. Oneliners abound, sometimes said in the distance so keep your ears open, and sight gags enhance the hilarity, oftentimes reminding me of the humor found in 'Family Guy', only much cleaner for the young audience targeted here.Bill Hader is great as Flint, with a sort of crazed innocence coming across, so sure of himself in the scientific world, yet completely unconfident in the realm of real-life relationships. Both James Caan and Anna Faris, as his father and love interest Sam Sparks respectively, are casting perfection. Faris is a riot; using that bimbo voice she pulls off so well to great use, especially when she has to talk about something brainy and genius-caliber smart. Samberg is a hoot as Brent and Bruce Campbell is channeling a bit of William Shatner in his portrayal of Mayor Shelbourne, but it is the venerable Mr. T as Officer Earl Devereaux that shines in the supporting category. It is such a treat to hear his voice—a wonderful complement to the overzealously athletic policeman. Everything is working within Phil Lord and Chris Miller's film, from the heart to the jokes to the visuals. It may not stand a chance against Up for awards glory, but it definitely sets itself apart as a film to be seen.",8,1,2,30 December 2009
Children of Men," Very odd, what happens in a world without children's voicesChildren of Men
","Although I have been waiting months to see the film based on its trailer, I couldn't help but be disappointed by how much that tease gave away. I remember that no matter how engrossing the visuals and music were in that two-minute clip, I could not shake the feeling I had just seen the entire film condensed. Thankfully, after finally seeing it (hopefully it will make it to Buffalo soon so I can catch the amazing cinematography on the big screen), I can say that the trailer really just shows the tip of the iceberg for what will happen. Not only does it deceive in a good way, it hides the real emotional journey that the movie takes. In twenty years our world will be on a steady road to manmade Armageddon. For the last eighteen years, women have been unable to conceive a child and this horror has allowed countries to go on a rampage to try and preserve their own ideals, as every day is a day closer to extinction. Wars are raging everywhere and it seems only Britain has been able to fortify itself to try and sustain what life is left for the small hope of survival. Refugees from all around the globe have tried to seek asylum in England, but are turned away or housed in detention camps until they can be disposed of. A group of insurgents, the Fishes, are trying to combat with the government's harsh policies of immigration, however, their war just begins a more rapid extermination of humanity as bombs and bullets fly throughout the streets. Maybe the bombs are acts of terrorism by the rebels, maybe they are set by the government to instill fear in the against the insurgents, either way the world has been shattered behind recognition.Clive Owen plays a former activist named Theo who has lost faith in the causes he used to live to defend. He works a menial job and longs for the visits to the countryside with an old friend Jasper, (played wonderfully out-of-character by Michael Caine), to hold onto a small sliver of what life used to be. When kidnapped by the Fishes, led by his ex-wife (the stalwart Julianne Moore) whose own faith in the cause has multiplied since the same event which dissolved Owen's, he becomes a part of what could be the miracle that will save the world. His involvement in this mission doesn't as much reinvigorate his belief in doing what he thinks is right as instead shake him from the meaningless life he's lived these past years, awakening him from his debilitating self-loathing. He is able to see first-hand the atrocities being committed and decides to put his life at risk for this young woman who's miraculous pregnancy could save the world. Theo doesn't do it for mankind, he keeps his goals closer to home. In saving this woman's life, so her baby can live, he might be able to forgive himself for the life chance has created.Owen is superb and he needs to be. Theo is in practically every scene as Cuarón has decided on using a cinema verite style staying close by in a fly-on-the-wall capacity. As an audience, we are thrust into the action as it happens all around our hero and ourselves. The singular vision Cuarón has successfully attempted here is unfathomable. There are multiple instances where we are treated to long takes lasting from five to ten minutes at a time. (I read an article that these shots are in fact digital composites bridged together to appear seamless; even so, the accomplishment is astonishing) One sequence towards the middle of the film has us inside a car with four characters. We spin 360 degrees around the interior in order to stay up on the conversation throughout and once the car comes under attack by savages, the view still doesn't break until after the car finally stops and the camera gets out to view the roadside. Whether you end up liking the movie or not, you must appreciate the technical achievement that went into it.Along with the fantastic visual flair and top-notch performances is the simple yet profound story structure. Like Cuarón did with Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, (having almost everything from the novel somewhere in the background), he gives the audience the benefit of the doubt. He understands that the medium of film is not the same as a book. With film we can see the descriptions and events occurring as though we are a part of the action; there is nothing more I hate then a character explaining something to someone that already knows for the sake of us, the viewers, being totally aware in case we missed extrapolating it for ourselves in the scene before. Does it matter where the troops are coming from? Does it matter what scientists are doing to find a cure? Why are babies no longer able to be born? None of these questions need to be systematically answered as the true story is of a man finding a reason to live again and his quest to save his young friend and her child. Less is definitely more and Cuarón truly understands how to mold cinema into giving us the answers we need without spoon-feeding. The brilliant performances by Chiwetel Ejiofor and Claire- Hope Ashitey are enhanced by the fact we know little of their past. We know just as much as Theo and therefore can relate to his actions rather than second-guessing everyone's motives because we know more than the protagonist. We experience it all along with the characters on screen. Cuarón is not telling a story that has happened, but instead allowing us to be a part of what's happening right now.",10,7,12,2 January 2007
Resident Evil: Apocalypse," Project Alice is onlineResident Evil Trilogy
","Paul WS Anderson has given us the newest trilogy of diminishing returns. I have never played the video game before and therefore went into the 2002 original Resident Evil containing little knowledge of the mythology. With that novice mentality, I found myself really enjoying the film. It gave me the background needed, the action and suspense expected, and a cliffhanger leaving me anticipating more. That continuation came but two years later with the subtitle Apocalypse. Here was a film that showed how the series' origin story was a huge part to the main plot of the first. This entry featured a bare-bones story, namely the extraction of a scientist's child from the infected Raccoon City, yet that was okay. The action was amped up, the characters more accessible, the acting vastly superior, and the ingenuity evolved. While lacking in plot, it excelled in action and effects, making it an equal, in my mind, to its predecessor. Its final twenty minutes was even devoted entirely to setting up the third piece to the puzzle. Here, though, is where the train derails hard. Extinction had a fantastic setup, yet instead of continuing right where we left off, we meet a caravan of survivors seeking gas and motoring cross-country. Nothing is progressed story-wise that we already did not know. Where the sparse plot didn't matter in the second, it stuck out like a sore thumb with the latest installment.It is Milla Jovovich's total blank slate in the first film, which makes it so endearing. We learn what the Umbrella Corporation is all about as she slowly remembers her role with them. It was a successful zombie movie, utilizing the jump scares and the hyperkinetic pace needed to keep you on the edge of your seat. All the characters were enjoyable to spend time with, we got zombified dogs, and a story that kept a bit of intrigue as to what everyone's motives were, while also being intelligent enough to keep my full, undivided attention throughout. The demise of all the people involved was interesting and to have a film end badly for all was a nice breath of fresh air. Alice does wakes up at the end, alone in a ravaged city, but she is definitely not in a position to rest up or smile at her good fortune.The transition into the second film is then seamless. We find that she didn't just wake up, but in fact is an experiment let loose on a city that cannot be saved. Our two survivors from the original are now pitted against each other to see which is the better soldier, and therefore the more effective military weapon. This fight is the entire story, though, as far as the main mythology goes. Otherwise, we have Alice and her new band of warriors on the lookout for the virus' creator's daughter. In effect, then, the whole story could have been told in about twenty minutesthey go in and get the child, Alice and Nemesis fight, boom, the film is over. However, the tale is padded with huge action sequences and gory zombie carnage. With the addition of Mike Epps to the cast, we are also treated with some nice comic relief, missing somewhat from the first besides Michelle Rodriguez's sarcastic quips. I never minded the simplicity of it all because it never tried to be more than what it was. I stuck with it until the conclusion and found myself even more excited for the third part. The setup had so much potential. Alice was fully formed, all her memory intact, and a new ability in telekinesis. With Nemesis gone and the zombies no match for her, we could finally get to see the showdown between her and the Corporation itself.And with that, we are treated to Extinction. It starts off pretty good with a cloned Alice being put through tests in a mock-up version of the mansion from the first film. It gets intriguing to hear what the scientists have been up to and to learn that Alice is outside trying to find survivors and keep herself off the grid. Then we get the first sign of trouble, an action scene that has nothing to do with the plot. Let's kill some hicks in the desert. If that wasn't enough, we also get a twenty-minute fight between our survivors and crowsyes those pesky black birds, newly infected. Sure the payoff is great, but really we are now halfway through the film and all that has happened is Alice found her old friends. We already knew she had powers and that her blood was special and could mean everything to the project. At the end of the film, that is the exact same knowledge we are left with. Besides many deaths and what could be the beginnings of a complete trainwreck of a sequel, starring no one else but Jovovich, (you'll understand when you see it), we learn absolutely nothing as far as mythology goes. I felt cheated and let down greatly because this film could have done so much more.In conclusion, the trilogy starts strong and ends with a disappointing whimper. The first had everything you could have wanted in a sci-fi/zombie/action flick. Scares, plot twists, and loads of violence and gore rounded out the successful entry. In came the second, lacking substance, but making up for it with flare. More characters, which never hurt the proceedings, more blood, more action, and more monsters can only mean non-stop enjoyment. And if the film doesn't deserve an extra point or two for Sienna Guillory's Jill Valentine, then you must have watched a different film from me. Next came the unfortunate failure of a third. What is less even than a bridge to the inevitable fourth, (will the box-office be enough to warrant it?), this last entry is a wasted opportunity to add to a nice little franchise.Resident Evil 7/10 RE: Apocalypse 7/10 RE: Extinction 3/10",7,0,1,21 September 2007
The Boy in the Striped Pajamas," Does the uniform still make you feel special?  The Boy in the Striped Pajamas
","It appears that filmmakers have an appetite for Holocaust films these days. I don't know if it has to do with the political strife occurring all over the world, America's involvement in the Middle East, Republicans comparing Obama to Hitler, or what, but the constant influx almost has dulled me to the point of avoiding them. How many different versions of the tale can be told before you become numb? So, I will admit to entering The Boy in the Striped Pajamas with much trepidation. It is adapted from a novel and the trailer makes it look like your run-of-the-mill tearjerker of luck and overcoming the greatest tragedy in recent history, if not ever. Oh was I mistaken. This film is the boldest, most ballsy take on the Holocaust I have seen yet  but maybe I say that only for its powerful ending.This story never shies away from the emotional toll that the Germans' decision to kill their prisoners takes on all involved. Characters are constantly having their eyes opened to the truth of the matter or shielded from it by lies and deceit. Right from the get-go, you know you're in store for something unexpected. When the Commandant throws a party for his promotion and subsequent move to outside a concentration camp, you assume it will be all 'Heil Hitler' and that nonsense. Yes, that is there, but it is not unchecked. Instead we are given a glimpse of heart and compassion from the Commandant's own mother, a staunch and vocal detractor to the cause. She gets in her jabs to head shaking of all those around her, as well as the confused looks of her grandchildren, unaware of what is really happening around them.One of the best characters is Vera Farmiga's wife to the Commandant and mother to his children. She is aligned with the cause and the call for a return of brilliance for the Fatherland  that is until her world is turned upside-down by the gigantic slip of the tongue from Lieutenant Kotler about what that smell actually is. The drape is released from before her face and she finally sees through the lies of it all; at once disgusted by her own naïveté as well as the realization of how her husband has become a monster. It truly is a devastating scene watching her breakdown in front of her husband, played with stoic perfection by David Thewlis, made all the more powerful that their son witnesses it through the open door. Her reaction is exactly what I believe this film is striving to bring out of the audience. We are to look at these monsters with contempt and disgust, wanting revenge and blood for what they are doingan emotional state you will need to feel when experiencing the unforgettable finale, needing to decide whether that bloodlust is just as bad once it's fulfillment is at hand.With all these thoughts of politics and German hubris running amok, there is also the tale of the little boy, oblivious to it all, being dragged in both directions at the same time. There is the duty to his father and love of family in direct conflict with what he sees with his own eyes at the camp. He knows in his mind that these 'farmers' are not living the life his father's propaganda film portrays, but his unquestioning love for that man makes his heart play tricks on the truth. Young Bruno never is quite certain about what is happening. All those he loves tells him of the Jewish evil and inhuman ways while he watches those same people commit those same acts on those they accuse of it. How can his friend Shmuel be such a bad person? He hasn't done anything. Someone must be mistaken about the whole ordeal; it can't be as bad as Shmuel makes it to be, but it obviously isn't as good as the soldiers say either. Therefore, what harm can come of going inside to help his friend find his missing father? The Boy in the Striped Pajamas quickly becomes a blindsided assault on our own sensibilities. What begins as a diatribe of Nazi ignorance and brutality, not told by the Allies, but instead seen through the actions of the German people themselves, soon becomes a journey to redemption of the 'eye for an eye' sort. Yes the hypocritical moments strike home, (Thewlis is quick to reprimand Rupert Friend's misguided soldier for protecting his sympathetic father's escape to Switzerland yet will not disclose his own mother's opposition to the cause), but it really all comes down to the two eight year olds playing as friends, hoping to meet in the future once 'everyone is getting along again'. Asa Butterfield is great as Bruno, the conflicted boy trying to juggle both worlds, but it is Jack Scanlon's Shmuel that will truly break your heart. His Jewish boy, with truths being withheld by the adults, afraid of what may happen if he plays catch or is caught eating contraband food, is completely authentic. His performance is so natural and true that you must wonder how much these young actors actually know about what they are portraying. If I was their parent, I don't think I could let them be involved in a film as strong as this, especially with the imagery at its conclusion. I really didn't think they'd have the guts to go through with it, but I applaud them for it absolutely. There really isn't any other way to end it; the devastation and retribution by the hand of fate was the only way to stay true to the tale. It is one you will not shake soon afterwards.",8,7,13,17 November 2008
From Dusk Till Dawn," I'm Sex Machine, pleased to meet yaFrom Dusk Till Dawn
","This year's Grindhouse was not the first of such collaborations between Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino. One could argue that their production of From Dusk Till Dawn laid the seeds for that schlock-fest extravaganza. I remember while watching Planet Terror thinking how overboard Rodriguez was going, and loving every minute of it. Revisiting this film, however, showed how he didn't stray too far from where he had already been. Sure Tarantino's dialogue is at the forefront for much of the film's duration, but when the action amps up and the vampire gore starts splattering, one can see the connection with Rodriguez's later film. Overall, this movie delivers big time. The laughs are many, the pop culture references are sprinkled throughout, the characters are all fully fleshed no matter how little screen time they are given, and the action is great to watch.The story is a simple one. The Gecko brothers have pulled off a heist and need to get to Mexico in order to pay off their partner. They kill and steal along the way until meeting up with a pastor who has lost faith and his two children in an RV. Taking the family hostage, they make their way south to a sleazy topless bar awaiting said partner's arrival. This specific bar, however, is inhabited by vampires who feed on its customers once the sun goes down. What is first a crime tale of men on the run soon turns into a fight for survival against the supernatural.While Rodriguez handles the directing well, showcasing some nice special effects and make-up work, it really is the script that shines. Tarantino has crafted a tale with just enough realism to keep it from going too far overboard. The dialogue is sharp and with himself and George Clooney starring, the delivery is spot-on. Quentin's Richard is a lunatic, pedophile/rapist who recently broke his brother Seth out of jail so they could complete this job. Seth is the brains of the operation and understands all the angles. His temper leads to many great one-liners and his release of tension when they cross the border successfully gives us even more. The relationship between the two is classic and I don't see Tarantino giving a better performance ever. His low-key psychopath is effective and I love his soft delivery of lines when his brother is not in the room to hear him.Our entry point into the film opens the action perfectly with what on the surface appears to be a generic scene between a sheriff and a gas station proprietor. When the officer goes to the bathroom we are finally able to meet the Gecko boys and understand what is really happening. Richard goes crazy, Seth shows his vindictive side, and John Hawkes is brilliant as the man stuck in the middle, doing what he is told, but subverted at all times by Richard's bloodlust. The rest of the film, until they meet the family that sticks with them to the end is full quality dialogue and acting. That family consists of Harvey Keitel, great in a role that is uncommon for himthe good guy, Ernest Liu as the son, with a nice realistic turn, and Juliette Lewis as the daughter, giving many memorable moments, especially opposite Tarantino.It's when they arrive at the Mexican bar and the vampires show themselves that the film really picks up. The script remains witty, but the supernatural flair infused with it brings a freshness that keeps the film from ever hitting a rut. Cameos are plenty, Cheech Marin, Salma Hayek, Tom Savini, and Fred Williamson among others, blood and guts are everywhere, and the violence rises to a crescendo. Clooney is allowed to run free, to great effect, with Keitel there at all times injecting a bit of calm wisdom whenever possible. From Dusk Till Dawn is far from a masterpiece, but it is fantastic entertainment and can be played with Grindhouse to create a highly enjoyable night of carnage.",8,1,2,7 October 2007
Black Snake Moan," This little light of mineBlack Snake Moan
","Craig Brewer is now officially a writer/director for whom I will see any film by, no matter how bad it may look. His debut, Hustle and Flow, was one of my favorites from that year, with its emotionally charged storyline and realistic, fallible characters. I wasn't quite sure what I would end up thinking after seeing this sophomore effort. The cast seemed great, the trailer used music effectively, however, it seemed like there was a good chance it would cross into absurdity, and fast. Fortunately, Black Snake Moan hits all its marks dead-on. The acting is astonishing, the writing superb, and the editing style, as well as juxtaposed music, riveting the whole way. Brewer seems to be a master at getting his characters to have the right mix of both compassion and malice as they set forward on their paths toward redemption.The first moment I knew I was in for a treat was during the abbreviated credit sequence at the beginning. Like he did with Hustle and Flow, Brewer lays the music over the widescreen shots perfectly with simply titled fonts coming up statically. The 70's aesthetic was welcome and helped show that this would be another great character piece in the vain of those from that decade of some of cinema's best. From here we continued on with the short snippets into the lives of both Lazarus and Rae, each vignette mirroring the other while they journey to the fateful moment their paths finally cross. The editing between them was fluid and relevant rather than abruptly cutting before the scene felt finished with its purpose. Rae's boyfriend leaves for duty in the service and Laz's wife leaves him for his brother. Each feels the loneliness and reverts to what they know in that situationRae to sex and Laz to the bottle. Only when Rae is left for dead at the side of the road and her savior comes from his farm to take her in does the reasoning for their actions finally start to become clear.Samuel L. Jackson is fantastic as the older bluesman farmer trying to reconcile his life with God and that of the flesh and the pain it has brought him. There are the moments of stoic sternness as well as those of kindheartedness with his captive/patient. You never really look at the setup as comical or unrealistic because he sells what he is doing so well. Also, the character of Rae is not chained up for very long, despite what the trailers would have you believe. The situation starts a bit awkward until we see that the chaining was for her own good and is actually used for only a day or two. As for that chained girl, Christina Ricci really shines. I never really saw her as anything special, but this role is a true breakthrough for her. This girl is so troubled that her past sexual abuse has scarred her very deep down. Any time she is away from her love she starts seeing flashes of the man who took her childhood innocence away and itches to be touched by any man available to let the image go away. Her nymphomania is not for pleasure, but rather for survival from the haunting nightmares always hiding behind her eyelids. Ricci fully inhabits the role and shows all the emotional trauma to great effect and realism. Mention must also be made of Justin Timberlake, again showing some real acting talent. Where this guy came from I have no clue, but hopefully he will continue taking more films and steer away from the mostly crap music he churns out.While not as solid and consistent as Hustle and Flow, Moan still ranks equally to it, in my mind, because when it is on, it is spectacular. Towards the end we have a truly enthralling sequence with 'This Little Light of Mine' singing out, and earlier, the interaction between captive and captor, when the chain is first introduced, shows some top-notch work. The truly magical moment, though, is when Jackson sings (yes that is him throughout, like it was Terrence Howard in Hustle) the titular song while a thunderstorm roars and the lights flicker. If I don't see a more beautifully shot sequence all year, I won't be surprised. What these two people do for each other is wonderful and shows what humanity is capable of. One thing I think I really enjoy with Brewer's work is the fact that he doesn't show sinners becoming redeemed heroes. Instead he shows us that no matter how bad you have been, or how bad life has been, everyone can strive for redemption and to be better people. We don't have saints here, but fallible people looking to right their ship. If the course stays true or if it falls back into darkness, no one really knows, but at least they can say that they tried as hard as they could.",9,64,86,10 March 2007
A Bug's Life," Flaming Death!A Bug's Life
","When watching A Bug's Life for the first time in a long while, I couldn't help but see the comparisons with last year's Happy Feet. As far as the main storyline goes, they are very similar, an outcast doing what he can to fit in while also attempting to be special. It just goes to show you how much better that film could have been without its liberal diatribe conclusion. A lot of people disagree with me when I say that I really like Pixar's sophomore effort. Sure it doesn't manage to capture the splendor of Toy Story, nor is the animation out of this world. However, the story is top-notch and the characters are wonderful to spend time with. With plenty of laughs and a moral center to boot, I could watch this one just as much as the studio's other classics.There is a lot about finding strength from within to conquer all odds here. Between our lead Flick needing to keep his self-esteem up to save his colony, the colony needing to open their eyes onto a new way of living for the future, and the circus bugs finding that they are more than just untalented sideshow freaks, everyone evolves into a better bug by the end of the story. Even the villain Hopper is fully fleshed and menacing for the right reasons. He is not doing it to be mean, but instead understands the fact that the ants outnumber him 100 to 1. He needs them to fear him in order to not have to worry about them finding out the truth. It is very much a circle of life, but not one that can't evolve with the ages.When thinking about the animation, it is actually quite good. Compared to Antz, the rival film of the time, this is much more realistic and less cartoony. The water is rendered nicely, as is the foliage. You don't have to look much further than the ants' eyes to see how much detail went into the production. The reflections and moistness, despite the smooth exterior, shows the realism. All the bugs are finely crafted too. The flies in the city and the crazy mix of creatures recruited to save the ants are never skimped on, whether for a small role or a more expanded one. It is also in the city that we see the workmanship on the environments. While Ant Island is nice, it is just the outdoors. Bug City contains plenty of garbage doubling as buildings and clubs. It is a great showing of humor and inventiveness to see what the animators used for everything. From the ice cube trays as circus stands, the animal crackers box as circus wagoncomplete with full nutrition guide on the sideand crazy compilation of boxes to create a Times Square of billboards and facades, everything is done right.As far as much of the humor, you have to credit the acting talent for wonderful delivery and inspired role choices. No one could do a male ladybug better than Dennis Leary with his acerbic wit. I dare you to think of someone better. Our leads are great too with Dave Foley as Flick and Julia Louis-Dreyfus as Princess Atta, as well as the always-fantastic Kevin Spacey as Hopper. Spacey not only steals many scenes from the movie, but also takes center stage in the bloopers during the credits. Yes, A Bug's Life was the originator of animated outtakes from Pixar, a tradition that has continued on. With many tongue-in-cheek bug jokes laced throughout, you also have to give props to the huge supporting cast. Full of 'those guy actors,' it is people like Richard Kind, Brad Garrett, and the late Joe Ranft as Heimlich the worm who bring the biggest laughs.Overall, it may be the simplest story brought to screen by Pixar, one that has been told in one form or the other numerous times over the years, but it is inspired enough and fresh enough to deliver an enjoyable experience. There are joyous moments, sad times, and even action packed scenes of suspense with birds coming in to join the fun. Complete with a couple of my favorite Pixar characters, Tuck and Roll, there isn't too much bad that I can think of saying about it.",7,9,10,25 November 2007
The Dark Knight," Sometimes the truth isn't good enoughThe Dark Knight
","The Gotham crime syndicates are afraid of the caped crusader to the point where their employees cower in the shadows at the sight of the Bat-signal and the mob bosses hold their meetings during the day. Worried that their finances are about to be seized by Lt. Gordon's strike force, (Gary Oldman once more showing his greatness in even the straightforward roles he takes when on hiatus from the crazed villains he is used to playing), they pool it all together and hand over control to an Asian corporation, naively thinking it is safe from Gotham and new DA Harvey Dent's jurisdiction. Only the demented nihilist The Joker understands that Batman has no bounds when it comes to what he is capable of. A vigilante himself, the superhero can go where he pleases and extract Lau from China, the man with every penny owned by the city's underbelly in his seemingly safe hands. This fact isn't a question of could happen, but instead one of will happen. It is the first step in The Joker's elaborate plan to take control of the city and prove to all that even the pure of heart can be and will be corruptible. Human nature is flawed and he wants to show the world just how much. Money is inconsequential; all he wants is the power and control.While first seen as a fly sticking out of a bee swarm, Batman and Gordon don't take any real heed of The Joker's threat. It is the mob they are after and, with the help of Dent, are almost to the point where they can take them down for good. But as Harvey says, it is always darker before the dawn and this crazed maniac is blotting out the sun. Devoid of morals and seriously insane'do you want to know how I got these scars?'he takes no prisoners and consistently plays with everyone on his trail. A master of the human psyche, he is always two steps ahead of Batman and Gotham's finest, pulling the strings on who is to live and who is to die. With the finding of his polar opposite in the form of Bruce Wayne's alter-ego, The Joker is ready to have fun. Knowing how Batman's one rule is the inability to kill, he pushes his buttons and places the blame of those he kills onto Wayne's consciousness. Having a man like Dent there to stand for justice, face accessible to the world and not hidden behind a mask, Wayne's guilt drives him to the edge of finally letting his identity be known. The Joker is a wild card in the poker match of life, orchestrator of anarchy, turning the world on each other and soon doesn't even need to actually do any of the killings himself. Those he toys with find themselves falling to the darkness of revenge and greed, doing his bidding without even having to be asked.No one is safe in this pitch-black world of violence and crime, almost completely shrouded in shadow once the small glint of light that seemed about to break through is snuffed out. Nolan throws conventions out the window with his plotting and willingness to take a chance on letting those we may find to be untouchable become expendable. He also has honed his action skills by giving us a bit more of a wide angle view on fights, letting them happen before our eyes and not be constructed later with quick cuts that don't meld together. And the special effects, all I can say is bravo. From the new gadgets, (sonar systems and a kickass bat-cycle whose introduction is only upstaged by its ability to flip 90 degrees by riding up a building wall), to the make-up work, (The Joker is unsettling to view without Heath Ledger's superb acting work), to the computer graphics, (not to ruin anything, but Two-Face is a sight to see), The Dark Knight pulls no punches.With solid acting all around, Christian Bale and company carry over the success from the first film without fail. However, it is the newcomers that bring the standard for comic book performances up to a level that may never be eclipsed. Aaron Eckhart is great as Dent with his pretty boy looks and affable charm. Unable to be bullied or scared, Eckhart embodies the good that Gotham has in its future and the subtle hinting to the darkness always hiding behind the façade of someone that pure of heart. He himself said it best, 'you either die the hero or live long enough to see yourself become the villain.' Foreshadowing at its best.But of course, the true amazement is with Ledger's Joker. When cast, many had their doubts, yet I remember always standing by the choice, knowing he could hit it out of the park if given the chance. Wow, this is the best villain ever put to screen. His vocal work and laugh are chilling and the facial ticks and licking of the lips just show the detail Ledger put in. The back-and-forths between him and Bale are always intriguing and exciting as the two powerhouses just put on a clinic and how about the introduction to his character at the start robbing the bank, what an entrance. The only part of this film that left me sad was the fact that we won't be able to see Ledger reprise the role in the next installment. Kudos to Nolan for already saying that they will not recast; it is an honor to the job Heath did and to the audience so as not to pull a switch, ruining the character and movie because no one could ever even attempt to match the craft that went into the role here. A fantastic performance in a fantastic filmwhatever you have heard, believe it.",9,4,9,20 July 2008
Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix," Naughty children deserve to be punishedHarry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix
","For starters, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix was by far my least favorite book in the series. Not much happens until the end, which is actually pretty good, there is a lot of repetition through the beginning of the story, and Harry's adolescent anger and temper just get plain annoying. After enjoying how the fourth book was adapted onto film, I was hoping we'd get more of the same here with a distilled version where main plot is paramount and the detentions and acting out cut down immensely. At first I thought I was going to be very happy. The film starts off great with Dudley and Harry in the London playground where the Dementors attack. Just having a sequence in a Potter film outdoors and not at Hogwarts was a welcome sight and everything pretty much went as planned. There were some exclusions when the boys arrived back home, most noticeably the absence of Mundungus, but I was willing to look past them. Even in the early time at Hogwarts, Potter has one outburst of anger and it seems that would be it. I was ready to ease into the tale and enjoy the ride, but that comfortability never occurred. I will say that the acting was par for the course. We have a few new characters and as a result see less of those we have come to love. McGonagall is almost nonexistentwhich means her attack is not used hereand she was the one person who stood up against new teacher Dolores Umbridge; Draco is a blink and you'll miss him role; and the Order itself are hardly seen until the climatic ending and that's a lot of decent paychecks for little work. Even Hermione and Ron have their roles shrunk in order to keep a big spotlight on newcomer Imelda Staunton's Umbridge. She is the main antagonist of the story so I understood the large focus on her, and Staunton is wonderful in the role. My problem was that she was made into an evil witch. In the book, although misguided in her thought process, she was not a vicious psychopath as she is shown to be here. Umbridge always did what she thought was right and allowed by the Ministry of Magic, however, her cinematic counterpart turns about halfway in, once her power is increased at the school. She becomes a monster doing anything she wants, at one point physically abusing a child, and even about to use the Cruciatus Curse on a minor, (I don't quite remember that one happening in the book, although I could be wrong). Maybe the reason I disliked the book was because she wasn't evil enough and Potter couldn't necessarily justify his anger, and in that regard, maybe the filmmakers needed to up the ante. However, by seeing this new incarnation, I have to say her wrong decisions in the novel were more believable because at least she thought she had her mind in the right place and wasn't just being a vindictive crazy woman.Besides this tonal change with Umbridge, I was disappointed in all the differences from the novel. **If you haven't read the story there are spoilers in this paragraph** This film was by far the least like the book, and that should have been a good thing, but unfortunately for me it was not. Besides things happening out of order, Trelawney's run in with the High Inquisitor occurring way too early, (and where was Firenze?), and Hagrid being gone way too long, many things were just changed all together. Cho Chang is used as a scapegoat when it was her friend in the book that blew in 'Dumbledore's Army.' This fact makes the relationship with Harry awkward and needing some extra work in film six to iron things out. Hermione never enchanted the sign-up list, nor used the magic coins as a meeting signal (something used again in book six). We never find out who is giving the Weasley twins money for their jokeshop, we don't get to see Neville's parents or Lockhart at the mental hospital, Harry doesn't end up being the only one cutting lines into his skin which subverts the extra abuse he receives above the others, and there is no Quidditch so Ron never became a goalkeeper. Also, Sirius does not get the chance to give Harry his magic mirror, which has to play into book seven or why would it even have been mentioned, and in fact dies from a curse not just falling through the curtained archway. The most egregious error, though, is the treatment of the centaurs. We never learn that they are ready for war and no longer care if it is children they hurt in the forest. This fact causes their capture of Umbridge to not have the meaning as it does in the novel, thus setting up their role for the following story. As far as that goes too, we never hear of Hagrid's work with the giants and whether they will join Dumbledore against the Dark Lord. **Spoilers finished**If I need to blame anyone, it will have to be first time Potter scribe Michael Goldenberg. It seems as though he didn't read the sixth book and decided to adapt this one without care for what he was leaving out that may be important later, not to mention how he treats some of the characters he keeps in. What was my least favorite book has now become my least favorite cinematic entry as well. Even when Chris Columbus gave us two mediocre paint-by- numbers films at the start, they at least stayed true to the books. With this newest one, the tone has shifted, most of the good parts were missing, and now the next film will probably need extra explaining to fix the mistakes made here in continuity.",6,1,2,21 July 2007
Into the Wild," TIFF07, review 3: Facing the blind deaf stone aloneInto the Wild
","Sean Penn's new movie Into the Wild arrives on the wave of a well-regarded novel about a college graduate who decides that the anger and violence in civilized society is too much to handle and commences a journey through nature in order to truly live life as it was meant to be. This film is a wonderful glimpse into the life of a kid, wise beyond his years, and the bonds that he creates with people along the way. A victim of excess in wealth and a shortage of love, Christopher McCandless hid inside his mind behind knowledge and philosophy, building up his intellectual strength, as well as the physical, in order to complete his trek, ultimately leading him to Alaska. Penn never falls into the trap of showing too much heartbreak on the side of McCandless's parents, because he doesn't want the audience to second-guess the decision he made. There is no debate to be had here, our protagonist has no alternative but to get out and live off the land. Only being completely self-sufficient can he grasp a meaning for his life and one day perhaps go back with that knowledge fully learned.Emile Hirsch is absolutely brilliant with his good-natured attitude and affable charm. His character believes that human contact is not necessary for happiness and never seeks out relationships. However, his character is so likable that they find him and latch on, not to change his mind, but to experience his level of being and hopefully learn something from him and help enlarge his vocabulary on life. The people he meets help him to fully grasp the decision of life in the wild and be able to survive it. Never coming off condescendingly to those he crosses paths with, Hirsch always holds a smile on his face. One scene, where he meets up with a couple of people from Europe, proves how contagious a clear outlook on life without the troubles of societal restraints can be. These three kids have a blast, if only for a few minuteswith Hirsch being chased by the police for rafting with no licenseand it makes one wonder if maybe we all should take a journey into nature and feel the freedom and full warmth of heart that a lack of stress to succeed in the business world can give.All the supporting players are magnificent at helping show the side to McCandless that Penn needs on display to succeed. Hal Holbrook, Brian Dierker, and Catherine Keener are by far the best of these side characters with Vince Vaughn and Kirsten Stewart adding some charm too. Dierker, Keener, and Stewart play hippie, flower-child type roles and allow Hirsch to show off how modest and unselfish he is. This is the family he deserved to have from birth and he is the son they wished their lives had earned them. At their best, all four together give some of the most emotionally charged moments in the film. Holbrook, on-the-other-hand, helps give insight into the philosophy that Hirsch needs to live with in order to survive the loneliness, looking him in the face, to come in Alaska. It is truly fascinating to see how every person adds something to his overall experience and to the tools he needs.Hirsch deserves a lot of credit because he truly outshines the film itself with his dedication and sacrifice to the role. The length of time needed to allow him the ability to lose the weight necessary for a main plot point in the movie is crazy. If the time wasn't that long and Hirsch did it all rapidly, I'm even more impressed. With all that, there are many instances free of dialogue that he needs to carry with body language and actions alone. True, much of this is enhanced by a wonderful soundtrack from Eddie Vedder, but evenso it is a remarkable performance. Kudos to Sean Penn for a gorgeous filming job also. He captures the countryside with grace, while infusing many moments of visual style by slow-motioning glimpses, knowing when to show the family left behind, utilizing informative and essential voice-over, and even breaking the fourth wall. When Hirsch first looks into the camera, at the audience, it does not seem unnatural in the slightest, but instead an amazing link for the viewers to take a look into his soul like those that crossed his path have. McCandless is so pure that it almost feels like glimpsing the calm protectiveness of God.",9,430,590,16 September 2007
Blood Diamond," Bling, BangBlood Diamond
","Here we have Hollywood's newest addition to the agenda driven film, trying to get people's attention to the plight of Africa. The trailers had me intrigued, but the press stemmed much of that anticipation as most I heard talked about how preachy the movie was, with its only concern being to show Americans the death and destruction that went into their precious engagement ring. I am a big fan of the three principal actors, however, and I tried to leave all the critic's words home when going out to see Edward Zwick's Blood Diamond. Thankfully I did, because if I listened to the hype, while some being true about its' purposes, I would have missed one of the best directed and acted films of the year.Similar to last year's The Constant Gardener, Zwick has given us a story about family and sacrifice to mask the underlying theme of exposing the inhumane activities going on inside, in this case, Sierra Leone. While I felt the former film succeeded immensely in veiling its true purpose with a heart-wrenchingly emotional tale of love and faith, the latter tries to do the same, but at certain moments fails. Between the middle of the film, when the main characters discuss what they know about diamond smugglingall generalities they both know already but speak aloud for the sake of letting us the audience in on the atrocitiesand the tacked on epiloguewhich subverts much of the beauty the final scenes before it brought, and serves as what looks like just a means to get Michael Sheen some dialogueI did find myself shaking my head at how heavy-handed the film was at times. I think these moments stuck out most because the rest of the film, the telling of Solomon Vandy's search for his refugee family, was so effective that it overshadowed all the message delivery devices. You really feel for the plight of Vandy and for both Maddy Bowen and Danny Archer as they try to put their professional lives on hold long enough to try and do good for their new friend and for themselves.Leonardo DiCaprio, as Archer, continues to get better and better with each role he gets. An actor that has always impressed me, much of his past work, while effective, has given off an air of boy in man's shoes. DiCaprio looks younger than most characters that he portrays and as a result comes off as unbelievable no matter how well he encompasses the role. An example of this would be The Departed from earlier this year. True I have Tony Leung's spectacular performance in the original film to compare it to, but Leo just seems out of his element at times, not quite yet realistic as a seasoned tough guy. His portrayal of Danny Archer, however, blows the doors off that generality because he truly embodies this character and feels like the 31 year old that has served in the military, been kicked around for years, and recently held in prison for smuggling. Between his first scene trying to see the main guy in charge to sell his guns and the powerful speech with Vandy about baboon hunting among other things, I was completely riveted by the job he did. Also, the accent stays solid throughout and seems natural enough to suspend disbelief that this is an American playing an Afrikaner.There must also be mention of the two other leads that successfully embody their roles. Jennifer Connelly is always solid and one of the best character women working in Hollywood today. Her facially expressions and body language are perfect as the strong reporter looking for the story to break the blood diamond case wide open. I credit Zwick as well for his directing the relationship between her and Archer. The sexual tension is there as well as the comradery needed between them. Their characters never break from who they are in order to enjoy a quick tryst amongst the carnage, they are totally creatures of their past. Our third lead, Djimon Hounsou, carries the emotional barometer here as he usually does. Like DiCaprio, Hounsou continues to grow as an actor and is steadily becoming one of the best in the business. After his debut in Amistad, without yet really knowing English, he had his true breakthrough in In America. He is so real and true in his performances, that you cannot help but pull for him to get through all that the world throws at him.It is true that the moments of preaching took a little away from the film and at times halted the brisk pace in order to give exposition into the diamond trade; exposition that is ultimately unnecessary in the larger story being told. The film is about civil war and three people caught up in the middle of it trying to find a way out that serves each of their needs. It is their survival that the audience gets caught up in, and not the reason the war started in the first place. Zwick shows a deft hand at filming wartime explosions and chaos. I have not yet seen Glory, but there are many moments here that bring to mind his last film, The Last Samurai. Besides the jarring camera-work and brutality that he is unafraid to show, there is also a parallel arc between our hero there and of Danny Archer here. Both films are about a man who has endured a tough life and learned to build a wall around his heart. As a character in Blood Diamond says though, all men may or may not be evil or good, however, they are all people. It may only take one moment to finally live the life they have always wanted, and the path to that moment doesn't always end up being nice.",8,2,2,24 December 2006
Pride & Prejudice," You have bewitched me body and soulPride and Prejudice
","Joe Wright's Pride and Prejudice is a truly solid bit of film-making. I can't say whether it is a good adaptation or not, being I have not read the novel nor seen the other film treatments, however, as a piece of work in its own right, it succeeds on all accounts. Gorgeous to look at, this debut shows all the signs of the greatness he was to achieve with this year's Atonement. From multiple long takes, sweeping through the scenery, choreographed to perfection in order to allow the characters to flow in and out of frame, to wonderfully shot dance sequences at the two balls, the craft is unreal. I don't want to knock the story, though, as it is quite good. Never having really taken the time to acquaint myself with the Jane Austen canon, I am pleasantly surprised with how good the tale of love and premature judgments of character is. Firing on all cylinders, I accept all the praise that was lauded on it upon its release fully.Wright seems to have the period drama down to perfection and it will be interesting to see what he does with his new film The Soloist, very much a departure from his two previous works. What we can expect, however, is a precise attention to detail and composition. Throughout this film we are given frames resembling works of art, (not to mention the actual artworks depictedI absolutely loved the marble statue of the veiled woman, breathtaking), with light and atmosphere filling every available space. The little things, like when Elizabeth Bennet is in search of her soldier friend at the ball and we see Mr. Darcy look at her from behind as she continues to walk away, add so much depth with no dialogue necessary. He knows what he wants to show at all times and is never afraid to allow what's on screen do the talking for him through emotions and actions. For a director to trust the craft and the medium at such an early stage of his career, so unabashedly, is a rare trait. Most would rely on his actors to pull out greatness, but instead he relies on no one but himself, and the vision he wanted to put to celluloid.If I were to fault Wright and the film at all, it would be with the handling of some performances, although I'm not sure how much I can really blame. The Bennet family is supposed to come across as loud and obnoxious, a family ill-suited to the status for which they are trying to marry into. They do this in spades, but I may have wanted it to be toned down just a tad. Jena Malone's role as the youngest sister is just plain annoying, but her crassness and lack of subtlety do help in a dinner scene later in the film in order to give her reason to slip and tell her sister a secret. Brenda Blethyn, as the Bennet matriarch, is also very over-the-top. The performance could be a bit grating at times, but thankfully we are given lengthy reprieves without her to allow us to handle those moments when she is in full force.The rest of the cast is absolutely fantastic. Keira Knightley, as she did in Atonement, really surprised me again with her starring role as Elizabeth. She is an actress that finally has deemed herself to deserve the accolades she receives in my mind. I understood people's fascinations with her looks (although maybe not in total agreement), but never the skill at her craft. Now, though, I am on the bandwagon. Mr. Darcy, our second lead, is brilliantly portrayed by Matthew Macfadyen as well. His transformation from stuffy aristocrat to enraptured slave to love is believable at every turn. Despite his burgeoning love, he was still trying to be true to himself and his friends when he gave advice on matters such as marriage. It takes the events between he and Elizabeth for both to realize their own fallibilities and stubborn pride. Only when they finally open up to each other and tell of what the other doesn't really know do they see that what they thought were good intentions were in actuality poor judgments. A good supporting cast bolsters these two stars too, with acknowledgements going to Rosamund Pike, Donald Sutherland (a wonderful final scene), Simon Woods, and the always-great Tom Hollander.For all those that decide to pass by Pride and Prejudice because it is a romantic fluff piece, I only have to say give it a chance. As far as drama goes, the story is well told, and as far as cinematic excellence, it delivers at every moment. I won't go on record and say that it must be the best version of the classic taleI'm always told the Colin Firth piece is betterbut I will say that this is one heck of a film. See it for the grandeur and the spectacle, but also become engrossed in the tale and the journey that love takes these two very different people on showing them and us how very much the same they are.",9,2,5,10 February 2008
Taken," Good luck  Taken
","Mr. Peter Morel, you have picked an express train to latch on togood for you. Something about Luc Besson just works every single time. I'm sad that his declaration of being finished with the director's chair may be true, however, his scripts are mounting and churning out entertaining action flicks. If you can get the Transporter series to make money from its wit and smart action, you know you are doing something right. I've yet to see these two guys' first collaboration, District B13, but as far as the sophomore effort goes, Taken, I have one more reason to finally seek it out. Released in Europe last year and finally making its way stateside at the end of January, the tale pits a retired US government 'preventer' with the Albanian captors that stole his daughter in Paris. His job ruined his marriage, strained the relationship he had with his child, yet gave him the specific skill set to get it all back. All he has to do is kick some butt, kill numerous baddies without a glimpse of remorse, and call in a few favors, while burning some old bridges in the process. Liam Neeson shows the physicality that George Lucas must have seen when casting him as a Jedi warrior, but didn't utilize. Well, Morel sure opened the floodgates and Neeson does not disappoint.The European flair shows face right at the start with the film's opening credits. Sure the star gets top billing, but who do you ask gets second and third? That's right, the director and writers, then followed by the title. Someone understands the true creativity behind a feature film. Well, not just someone, a continent. Whereas we in the states only care about who we see'doesn't that new Brad Pitt film look awesome?' 'Oh, I don't know, I kind of wanted to check out the latest from Paul Thomas Anderson.' 'Who?'cinephiles abroad know the creators, the orchestrators, and the people for whom there'd be no words for Pitt to speak. It's a shame that the name Luc Besson won't fill the seats by itself here in America, because I'm sure if you mention a lot of his filmography to a film fan and ask what they all have in common, the answer would be, 'all films I really enjoy'. And yet the person answering probably has no idea what the common factor is allowing them to be such.Shot with a kinetic pace, not quite Tony Scott speed as my friend suggested, more Bourne Supremacy, but even a bit clearer than that, the action excites at every turn. Neeson is a man on a mission; a man with everything on the line to find and save his daughter before the estimated 96 hours are up and she is lost forever, sold on the black market to be used, abused, and most likely disposed. Friends, enemies, strangers, you name it; they are all potential targets to be shot at. Neeson's Bryan Mills is the ultimate badass working from his heartusing his head, but only to survive, not to censor his actions so as to stay out of trouble. He gave it all up to rekindle a relationship with his seventeen year old, yet I'm sure never thought that the only way to do so would be to use all that training. The flip remark from Leland Orser, calling him Rambo, is more appropriate than you may think.The supporting cast is definitely a necessity to keep the plot moving, but, in the end, it's all about Neeson moving forward and bull-rushing his way through extras. Maggie Grace can sadly get very tired, but I don't fault her as much as casting. She is a 26-year old playing 17, so her overly annoying, girlish tendencies are overblown because she is overcompensating for the age difference. Famke Janssen and Xander Berkler, two favorite character actors of mine, are solid in small roles, while my favorite supporter is Olivier Rabourdin's Jean-Claude. Playing a French Internal Government agent, an ex-associate of Neeson, he portrays the duality of wanting to help his friend while still keeping his job and financial influx intact. He knows that whatever is uncovered in the one-man vigilante escapade could potentially harm his paycheck by exposing illegal dealings with criminals on the part of the police force, so he is never completely open. And that guardedness leads to a fantastic dinner scene.Taken is action-packed and a great showcase of Liam Neeson's ability to break out of the mild-mannered Brit he sometimes gets relegated into playing. No one is safe from his wrath and no obstacle will get in his way; in fact, those obstructions actually help him hide and kill with even more accuracy and safety. Besson also keeps his streak going of highly entertaining scripts helping to launch the careers of FrenchmenLouis Letterier going from Danny the Dog to Hollywood's The Incredible Hulk anyone? If this, and the high praise for District B13, is any indication, the name Peter Morel may soon be one on billboards stateside as well. As I said, he hitched his trailer to the right perpetually moving train.",8,1,2,30 January 2009
Grindhouse," These guys got the devil in themGrindhouse
","Overall the film was technically perfect. Each segment was aged in post-production to make it look as though the film was thrown around and lost for the past thirty years, slowly decomposing in unsafe archiving conditions. The scratches and the film speed errors are a work of art in themselves as they never get distracting or go overboard, but instead look like normal decay for a no-budget, B-movie of this sort. Each had its moments, but I will give the edge to Rodriguez on effectiveness and seamless integration. While Tarantino succeeded with his moments of hitches/rewinded replayed seconds, his use of the 'missing reel' ended up feeling like a gimmick rather than a reality. It was just a way for him to not show us a moment that had been building up for a while with the scene previous ending smoothly and the scene after starting right up. Rodriguez, on-the-other-hand, played it cool by burning the filmstock right before the moment of lost material. Rather than the reel being missing, it made it seem destroyed; the cut from the card to a burning building brings laughter at missing a key plot point instead of disappointment from being unable to watch what could have been a crucial motivating factor for what the killer does next in Tarantino's half.As for the films themselves, we are treated to two distinct genres, the zombie/horror and the slasher/thriller. Rodriguez's Planet Terror truly brought back the spirit and look of an old camp-infused shocker. We have a government-involved release of a toxin, which kills and then brings back to life those exposed, making them hunger live flesh. We have the hard- edged sheriff (played to perfection by the underused Michael Biehn), the token victims (Nicky Katt is hilarious as the hospital's first exposure to the epidemic), the supporting players (a nice intercut storyline with the gorgeous Marley Shelton and her husband Josh Brolin who really got the mood of his character and hit it out of the parkloved the thermometer), and our protagonists doing whatever it takes in the name of love to survive (a rediscovered Rose McGowanwho is great both here and in Tarantino's part, showing some real emotion in the midst of absurd character evolutionand probably the best acting in the whole piece from Freddy Rodriguez). We get blood and goo, face-melting, limb-chopping, flesh-eating, blood filled balloon people splattering against windshields and survivors as they are mowed down, and a genital obsessed Naveen Andrews with the best comic relief of the night. There is gore, there is sex, and there are scares mixed with laugh-out-loud craziness. Robert Rodriguez knew what he was doing and he upped the ante wherever he could, making Planet Terror a flawless piece of cinema trash.As for Tarantino's Death Proof, I was ready to be amazed. The credit sequence was fabulous as the titles overlaid static motion shots, looking out the windshield of a car, a woman's feet on the dashboard. This was looking to be pure 70's and I couldn't wait to get going. We are introduced to a trio of women out cruising the bar scene, talking about sex and love and whatever else, naturally and realistically, when we get the foreboding glimpse of the deathproof car, complete with skull and crossbones. The tension rises when the killer is finally introduced and the dialogue is sharp, witty, and twisted in just the right way. Credit Tarantino for giving us one of the best driving sequences ever as the car holding the girls (playing air-drums to a classic rock diamond in the rough) rapidly moves into a confrontation with the killer's vehicular weapon. My adrenaline was up, carnage was fresh on the screen, and it was time for act two to bring the level up even more. Unfortunately this is where Death Proof falls apart. All the build up we just experienced ends up resetting as we go through the motions again: a new group of women driving and talking, eventually to meet up with our killer. This sequence might have been better than the first, except it never got the chance because all I could think was 'didn't I just sit through this a moment ago?' Granted, the final car chase is amazing, two cars playing out the roles of killer and victim running from each other, and losing each other along the way, like any of the best slasher films, however, I was bored to tears by the monotonous set-up, having to sit through another set of women being introduced. How can it be effective if after finally seeing some action from an amazing Russell performance, we don't get to see him for the next thirty minutes? All the suspense is gone by the time he comes back, and I found myself not quite caring anymore (Although Russell does up the camp, when the tables are turned, at the finish for some brilliant laughs).So, overall, the experience at the Grindhouse was fantastic. Rodriguez was on fire with both Planet Terror and his faux trailer Machete and Tarantino knew the score if he didn't quite know how to pace his piece correctly. I even loved the fact that characters reoccurred throughout, even if that gimmick went a bit too far having Biehn's and Jordan Ladd's roles reprised in the trailers as well. As for those trailers: pure unadulterated fun. Rob Zombie and Eli Roth did fantastic jobs at putting the craziest ideas they had on screen knowing they didn't have to coherently put them together, as trailers just show disparate glimpses anyways. Biggest laughs of the night, though, go to Edgar Wright and his trailer for Don't. It was hilarious and I loved the cameo by Wright regular Nick Frost, priceless. These guys have whet my appetite for more double-bill goodness, and hopefully Rodriguez and Tarantino will live up to the speculation and do a Grindhouse every few years or so.",9,1,6,7 April 2007
Up," A land lost in time  Up
","Over the years, the studio has gone from heartfelt children's fare to more heady dramas—still with a youthful touch, but deeper and more resonate than your standard 'stick the kid in front of the screen and have quiet for a couple hours'. It began with Ratatouille, a tale so layered that you couldn't remember how vague and almost unappealing the trailer looked, followed by Wall-E, with its power of visuals and emotions overcoming the need for dialogue to tell a heartfelt love story. And now, in 2009, Disney/Pixar brings us one of their best yet with Up. The trailer and studio pedigree may have gotten me in the seat, but the story, barely touched upon in the teaser, is what kept me enraptured and wanting more.Going in, I was truly unaware of what was in store. My minimal knowledge from the advertisements was that it would tell the story of an elderly, crotchety old gentleman named Carl Fredricksen and his adventures traveling the world in his house, elevated and transformed into a blimp by hundreds of helium-filled balloons. Oh, and about him warming up to the young Wilderness Scout Russell who finds himself on Carl's porch at the time of liftoff. However, right from the get-go, we see how much more Up is going to be. We are first introduced to a youngster in a movie theatre, watching newsreel footage of his hero Charles Muntz and the adventures he took to South America's Paradise Falls. This young boy pretends to be his idol and stumbles upon a kindred soul in Ellie, a little girl dreaming of adventure as well. Through a lovely montage, we watch as these two grow up and become Carl and Ellie: a couple in love, heart and soul.What I love about Pixar is its ability to throw easy out the window and put the hardships and rough times of life on screen. Life is dirty and full of tragedy, but without those difficulties, the wondrous moments wouldn't be so worthwhile and memorable. Carl spies the money jar, he and his wife now very late in age, and decides to finally get two tickets to Venezuela and live their dream of traveling to South America. As happens, though, the moment he was going to surprise Ellie is the moment where she breaks down, needing to be hospitalized, soon passing on to the next world. Carl, without his better half, becomes a shut-in, wanting to be left alone in the house—the last piece of Ellie that he has. But, when an incident occurs, leading to his arrest and subsequent ruling to move to a nursing home, Frederickson decides to bring the house itself to Paradise Falls and once and for all do the thing he's wanted to for over half a century. And all this happens in just the first 30 minutes or so. There is no one that does cartoon exposition better than Pixar, their stories so intricate and endearing, every character—whether human, animal, or inanimate object come to life—becomes a fully realized creature.When the actual adventure portion of the tale begins, you are already fully engrossed in the journey, feeling for Carl and his loss and subsequent need to flee. As any old person trying to be left alone does, he becomes short and unfriendly with young Russell once the boy is let inside the 'ship', and with future acquaintances such as Dug the dog and Kevin the bird, he attempts to be uncompassionate to and unwanting of them. Events in his past will show why he feels this way, but the love we see that he had for his wife and fervor for life previously tell us that he will soon warm up to those around him as Up is not only a journey of adventure, but also of rediscovering one's reason for living. Carl's passion and need to get out and travel is reinvigorated once he acquires someone else to give his heart to.Besides the wonderful story, Pixar once more shows how their studio is at the cutting edge of computer animation. They do not attempt to render realistic humans because they aren't trying to mimic live-action. Instead, they keep to a stylistic choice throughout, keeping a unique creativity while still holding a place in the real world. The filters used and authenticity to old photographs and scraps of newspaper in the Fredricksen's 'book of adventures' is astonishing in its believability. I loved the aesthetic of Paradise Falls, including Kevin and his almost dinosaur-like bone structure, but completely bird exterior. Even the voice acting is inspired in its choices and successful across the board. Bringing in Ed Asner to handle Carl was a perfect marriage, giving the role a hard-edged growl, yet still allowing the softhearted soul to show when necessary. And young Jordan Nagai, playing Russell, is by far the best part of the film. His childlike naivety is believable and his speech pattern and boyish mannerisms allow the character to leap off the screen.Disney's partnership with Pixar definitely kept alive one of the best film studios around. Whether Pixar would have survived to tell the stories it has on its own is a question we won't need to find an answer to. No one else would think to include dogs with collars that allow him or her to talk, let alone have it done in such a disjointed and easily distracted way. The constant train of thought changes when a squirrel or ball come into their view is priceless and the unorganized speech, calling to mind Yoda, really hits home as being exactly how I would have thought dogs would think. The filmmakers got every detail right and show once more why their studio is at the top of cinematic animation and very well could be at the top of cinema as a whole.",10,3,6,4 June 2009
The Wind that Shakes the Barley," I try to get out and can'tThe Wind That Shakes the Barley
","Finally a war film, a genre which I could do without due to the fact that few really need to be seen twice by me, has come along to give me reason to feel for the cause and the men fighting for it. Ken Loach's The Wind That Shakes the Barley is a truly moving portrait of a nation desperately wanting to be free from the clutches of the tyrant English. This is a small film and as a result relies immensely on its characters to drive the pace along rather than heavily orchestrated battle scenes, however, when we get gunshots, the moments do not disappoint. What could be the smallest scale war epic I've seenit could very well pack the biggest punch.This film is definitely about the IRA's fight for a free and autonomous Ireland, but at its heart it is about the Irish and how their lives and customs lead them forward into the battle. In order to get the audience engaged into the fight, we are given a pair of brothers to root for and care dearly about. Damien (Cillian Murphy) and Teddy (Padraic Delaney) are caught in the middle of the fight and join up to help free themselves. Teddy is a leader of sorts who rallies those around him for a brutal attack on the enemy. Damien, on the other hand, is a doctor ready to leave the country and pursue his dream of helping the sick. Only after he sees firsthand the brutality of the armed occupants running wild inside his country does he realize that he is needed at home more. Damien becomes his brother's second hand man and slowly watches his own soul disappear, turning into a shell of man with only victory and freedom on his mind. A man once living to help those in need, he soon finds that the cause calls for him to cross the line into territory he can never cross out of again until the victory is complete and final.What really hit home while watching the movie was the brilliant acting by both Murphy and Delaney. The two are strong individuals who have the confidence to watch out for one another but also to question the validity of what they are doing. As the film evolves, we soon find that the two brothers slowly change, almost into how the other began the story. Our early look into this is when, after a court decision finds a man guilty, Teddy takes the man out of the bailiff's hands and out into the street. He says that the man is needed to bankroll their weaponry and prolong the fight for freedom. His brother Damien is quick to call him out, though, saying how by not upholding the court they would be no better than the British. It is then OK to have ideals to fight for, but during the course of the war they don't necessarily need to uphold them to battle for them. This scene is an integral turning point as we are finally shown the strength of mind Damien has built up, the fight his sibling started needed to be fought the right way and the reasons for his fight could not be compromised. On the flip side of the coin, though, Teddy shows that compromise is not something he is adversely opposed to. Small victories seem to be enough for him, but you can't watch your kinsmen die around you for less than what you set out to accomplish.The beauty here is in the dialogue heavy sequences between the IRA as they contemplate what to do next. Scenes like those in the jail cell once turned in by one of their own, or discussing whether a treaty with the British should be ratified, or the editorializing from their priest during Sunday mass tell more with words than any battle scene could. At its core, the fight for Irish freedom was one of politics and idealism, the war and death was only an accompaniment. The war of words showed more direct hits than the ambushes planned as a result to send their messages. I also must credit writer Paul Laverty and his fantastic cyclical story. The allusions at the end to moments from the start really weigh on a viewer's conscience, slowly uncovering the true motives behind these men we have been rooting for throughout. When Delaney's Teddy finds himself in the exact same position as his brother having to deal with a traitor at the start, it is truly heartbreaking to watch his face as he realizes what he must do. This is truly a war that turns from driving out a common enemy to civil unrest, as the man who fought by your side soon becomes a proxy for the entity you battled to rid yourself of. One can't expect a soldier that is told victory is the only option to be happy with anything short of it. Sometimes you train those you love a little too well.The way these men fought, for a goal as important as freedom, while never losing their faith or conviction, is truly inspiring. Each man, no matter how brutal or unapologetic for the actions they must take, never forgets himself or the God he cherishes. Before any execution, the victim is allowed to write his goodbyes to those he loves and they are given to God as men. After each death, the sign of the cross is given in prayer for the fallen. The Irish are big Catholics and it is this attention to detail that gives the story its heart and emotional resonance. Loach never shows us robots fighting because they are told tono, these are men fighting for what they believe in and if not for themselves, then their children who will one day live as all humanity should, completely free and accountable to no one.",10,3,10,8 May 2007
The Descent," Love every dayThe Descent
","I am not a big fan of the horror genre. Many of them are just too campy or schlocky to be terrifying, too derivative of each other, or too slow and drawn out while trying to be suspenseful. Besides the first two masterpieces of the Hellraiser series and the original, read only good, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, I could do without the genre completely. I don't mention Hostel here, because as I've said in my review for that film, it isn't as much a horror as a thriller told brutally. A horror film needs to have genuine jump out of your seat moments as well as creepy, dark visuals. Fortunately the buzz surrounding Neil Marshall's 2005 film The Descent is warranted, because going to see this movie allowed for the best time I've had seeing a horror flick in a dark theatre since the final fifteen minutes of The Blair Witch Project.Marshall is definitely a storyteller. He allows time for the audience to get to know each character and facilitate a connection to them so we care about what will eventually happen, much in the vain of Ridley Scott's opus Alien, which many compare this to. Sarah, played with a real range of emotion by Shauna Macdonald, has suffered a great loss. Her mind wanders often to visions of her manifested grief, (these moments are very effective on the scare level as well as a psychological one). Sarah's friends decide to continue with their yearly extreme outdoor excursions, this time to a cave system, hoping to get her mind off of the darker areas of thought and into one of companionship and hope for the future. Yes, the cast of characters are pretty much the ones you'd expect: the hotshot, brash adventurer Holly; the vocal leader Juno; the English teacher, self deprecating and looking to the wellbeing of her friends Beth; the young med-student, who you know will eventually need to use her expertise for the cause, Sam; and Sam's big sister Rebecca, who goes through the entire movie cautious until she must show her strength. All the women do a phenomenal job in their parts making them fully fleshed and real. The beauty of the film is the reality it is steeped in, this isn't a fantasy with myth and magic; it is just a heightened world where what happens could actually have some possibility to it, as far as evolution and science play a role. Unfortunately, the realism, which caused the most suspense, knowing that maybe this could happen, eventually gives way to blood and gore. It is a shame because the abundance of blood almost took me out of the taut story; it wasn't necessary at all as it's not the gore causing the frights, but the conflicts shown. Subtlety works best and thankfully there is more of it than the small bursts of excess later on.The beginning half of the movie sets up a wonderful sense of foreboding and intrigue for what is to occur. We are shown a story, an almost buddy orientated tale, with mishaps and light moments as well. While the visions Sarah sees are the main focuses for thrills, there are also many instances from nature. Thankfully we are allowed this period before the real horror is revealed, because it builds up the suspense to finally be released. The handling of the second half is for the most part just as effective as the first. Adding in the crawlers ups the stakes for sure, but Marshall doesn't fall into any traps of the genre where he makes everyone into a hero. Each character pulls from within herself and does what she would do in that situation. What Juno does during her first foray against the creatures is uncommonly genuine. Natalie Jackson Mendoza plays the emotional range like a pro, from fear to anger to hatred to remorse. Her actions are all reactionary and I applaud the writer/director for taking it as far as he did. Mendoza is the star that I will remember most, her character was at the crux of the story; she brought them out there and her reasons for this, as revealed during its course, were not so much selfish, but apologetic. Macdonald also shines as the distraught widow trying to prove to her friends that she won't be the adventurer that backs off first. She needs to prove to herself that she can be normal again after her tragedy. The visions allow for some mystery as to what she is seeing and hearing in the cave, and whether anything is real. There are many homages, especially with the Sarah role, including a nice Martin Sheen in Apocalypse Now, rising from beneath a liquid pool, and multiple mirroring of her face and hair to that of the final scream in Tobe Hooper's Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Also, the final frame is highly effective; that's a vision I'm sure she will be seeing for the rest of her life.In order for The Descent to be successful, one needs to have successful acting, emotions amped, and as many light, humorous parts to offset the brutal shocks following. Marshall seems to be one to watch in the horror rebirth happening of late. Hopefully he won't shy away into the PG13 crap and instead stay the course to tell the story as it needs to be told. Unfortunately there did seem to be some compromise with the US release, as the ending is not the original one. Hopefully this was a decision on his part and not the producers strong- arming him. I will also definitely be seeking out his previous movie Dog Soldiers, to see whether this one was an aberration or a sign of things to come.",8,2,6,12 August 2006
Some Like It Hot," Where did you get that phony accent? Nobody 'talks loike thet!'Some Like It Hot
","I was finally able to catch up with what many people call the funniest movie ever made, Some Like It Hot. This is now the first and only film I have seen with Marilyn Monroe as well as directed by Billy Wilder. The hype on these two seem to be correct and I look forward to checking out more from both. However, the real success of the film is the portrayal of our two leads by Jack Lemmon and Tony Curtis. Both bring a fantastic comedic element to the story and play their roles to perfection. So many films afterwards have taken the general plot linetwo people see a gang shooting and run away/change identities to not get killed only to end up running into the mobsters coincidentally in the city they have relocated to, and remade it. None of them come close to the level of achievement that this one has, way back in 1959.Right from the get-go, seeing the thug/big-nosed Italians hiding in the back of a hearse in order to smuggle whiskey during Prohibition, we know exactly what we are in for. Wilder allows the story to play out on both a dramatic and comedic level, never straying too far into one to let the other fall away. Sure there are some laughs at the start, especially between Lemmon and Curtis in the funeral bar and a couple moments poking fun at the 'coffee' code language, but only after the two go on the lam as women instrument players in Florida do the big laughs come. The two men are just so manly that looking at them in drag brings a smile to your face, let alone when they actually talk. Lemmon is brilliant as Daphne, the loquacious girl that likes to talk too much and have fun, slowly getting so good at being a female he starts to believe he is one. 'Just keep telling yourself you're a boy.' As for Curtis, he shines as three separate roles. He must be believable as the gambling, womanizing, sax player Joe; the millionaire, yacht-owning Shell Oil tycoon; and the best friend, Conservatory-trained musician Josephine. Each character is created and used to enhance all the others as he tries to con Marilyn Monroe's Sugar into falling in love with him.Monroe plays the flighty blonde to great success. She continually calls herself dumb and the words that come out of her mouth, as well as the believing of all the drivel that comes from Curtis' tycoon (some real funny lines), prove that fact. Being that I had always heard she wasn't too bad an actress, I wasn't quite sure what to expect since my impression of her was more model used to sell seats, not any skill at the craft. While she is definitely radiantly beautiful here, I have to believe she isn't just being the pretty face. Yes, she gets top-billing, but although she isn't in the movie for that much compared to her co-stars, she does well with the time she is given. I'm not sure how successful the movie would have been without her to have the boys play off of. The glowing smile and sex appeal are one thing, but her scene of depression upon being dumped shows a vulnerability and strength through tears, yet keeping a calm, collected voice, show that maybe there really was something there.Where the film really works is with the situations brought about by the duality of our leads. Their fighting with themselves and each other, sometimes forgetting what sex they are at the moment, let alone truly are, is priceless. Lemmon's fast-talking naïveté gets him to bring the biggest laughs, thanks in part to a wonderful supporting role from Joe E. Brown as Osgood Fielding III, but Curtis is right there behind him. His machismo, used to put Lemmon in line, contrasted to his gentility, when with Monroe, is spot-on, as is the accent of affluence used to win her heart. Credit goes to Wilder for one of the best scenes from the film involving all four characters. The transitional cuts between Curtis and Monroe, attempting to let him feel love again, with Fielding and Lemmon, cutting up the tango dance floor, are absolutely hilarious. The juxtaposition of Daphne's tall, muscular frameat times leading the dancewith the small, thin, elderly Brown can't be viewed without some amount of giggling.It may not be the funniest film I have ever seen, but I can totally see where people are coming from when making that statement. Released just before the 1960's, this film can be seen as incredibly influential to the comedy genre and cinema in general. One-liners are present throughout and the acting is professionally handled at all times, bringing the laughs, but also staying grounded for those moments of seriousness when relationships are failing and death seems awfully close at hand. I hope to catch up with more work from all four principals here, to view some movies of an era I am not very proficient in, and to hopefully enjoy myself as much as I did here.",8,4,6,6 January 2008
The Da Vinci Code," 'O' Draconian Devil'
","Finally I can cross The Da Vinci Code off my list of movies to see. While I thoroughly enjoyed the novel, I was on the fence when the prospect of going to the movie came up. In the end, I realized it needed to be seen on the big screen, and I'm glad that was the decision. It, of course, paled in comparison to the book, but all in all was still a successful adaptation, staying true for its entirety. Unfortunately, because it stayed so true is why it wasn't a masterpiece.I give full credit to the actors, each did their role justiceeven Tom Hanks as our hero Robert Langdon, the one character I went in not thinking was perfectly cast. Jean Reno and Ian McKellen were brilliant as Captain Fache and Sir Teabing respectively, Audrey Tautou and Alfred Molina brought credibility to their parts, and Paul Bettany encompassed the albino Silas perfectly. Bettany truly stole the show and it's a shame many of his scenes were cut in the adapting process, leading him to just be a villain with only small shades of the misguided, lost soul he really was. I am also thankful that the filmmakers made the Hanks/ Tautou dynamic more of a friendship then budding love affair as it was in the book. The age gap of the actors was just too much for it to work and by thinning that relationship; it made the characters more believable in the scope of things. Ron Howard made a good directorial choice in guiding his cast this way; it's too bad he didn't alter anything else.Howard fell into the Chris Columbus rut with The Da Vinci Code. As Columbus showed with his first two installments in the Harry Potter saga, staying word for word to the source material does not a great movie make. Text and film are two separate mediums that must be molded unto themselves for complete success. Howard seems to have been so preoccupied with pleasing the Dan Brown fanatics with a faithful adaptation that he forgot this movie was his baby to do with as he pleased. Yes, the direction has some very nice visual flair evidenced with the fading of current action to past happenings, beautifully done on the crossing of the street towards the end where buses are going through swarms of walking pedestriansbut overall the text from the book has been lifted to the screen, more as a book on film then a piece of cinema. What this movie needed was a shot in the arm like the resurrection Alfonso Cuarón created with his Potter rendition. While still true to the Prisoner of Azkaban's essence, Cuarón was able to put his stamp on the film by adding atmosphere and a sense of foreboding visually rather than falling back to what worked on the page.Critics complained upon release that The Da Vinci Code preached rather than revealed, which I must agree with in part. It's not that there is more exposition in the movie than was in the novel, in fact there is less. Because of the need to shorten the text to allow for a two-hour movie, scenes must be sacrificed. However, here they were too afraid to do any cutting, instead the filmmakers condensed. Whereas while reading we are brought into the hunt, listening to each character's ruminations spanning chapters as they slowly crack the newest puzzle, on screen we are given solutions practically in the next breath as the question itself. This lack of methodical pacing makes it seem as though we are being taught because we don't get to be a part of the unraveling. So, this isn't a bad adaptation at all, it is actually near perfect. The real truth ends up being that the novel just was not a good candidate for the cinematic conversion. Sometimes engrossing prose works because of its medium and unless a director comes in to capture the essence and create a film out of it, rather than of it, we are left unsatisfied with a result that never truly takes form to stand by itself as a movie.",6,0,2,22 July 2006
Rocky III," Predictions? PainRocky III
","After all these years, I finally had the opportunity to watch my least favorite of the Rocky series, Rocky III, again. With the new installment, Rocky Balboa, having just reinvigorated my enjoyment in the saga, I couldn't wait to see a true tragedy with this one. I'll say that it did not end up that way entirely. I actually had a real good time watching it. Upon completion, I turned to my friends and said, 'that wasn't as bad as I remembered.' They replied by saying, 'yeah, but I'm sure we didn't laugh that much the first time we saw it either.' So, I am not going to declaring this a masterpiece by any means. Truthfully, the score I gave it from the memory of years back will stay the same. Maybe I would have increased it if the film's goal was to be a comedy, but since it tried to be a drama, it did ultimately fail.I give full credit to Sylvester Stallone. He wrote the original and ended up starring in it on more accident than anything else. He took that classic and turned it into a franchise beloved by many. This entry just has too much of its era on displaythe 80's are in full force. I understand what he tried, showing how success and the Me-lifestyle of the decade turned a champ into a chump. Some really great stuff happens too: Mickey saying that he had been protecting him and keeping him out of contenders' grasps, Apollo Creed coming to his defense as a promoter, and Adrian stepping up and telling her husband how it is, despite her wanting him to retire. The bad just outweighs the good way too much. Between the circus in the hotel training facility, Hulk Hogan's embarrassing cameo, Mr, T's street version of Muhammad Ali trash-talk, Burt Young's ridiculous remarks at every turn, and Sly's new wardrobe, I shook my head in shame the whole time. The real travesty, though, is that Mickey had to go out in such an inferior product.Along with all the unintentional laughter, the re-training of Balboa at the hands of Creed and DukeCarl Weathers and Tony Burton carry the filmis fantastic stuff. The montages are cheesy and each scene drips melodrama, but the thought is what counts. Making a slugger become faster and graceful is an interesting spin and makes perfect sense. Maybe Sly just needed a script doctor to hone his good ideas into a more enjoyable whole. As is, though, while the underlying themes and progression of the series is worthwhile, the fluff just drags it all down into the gutter.",4,2,6,18 November 2007
The Happening," Cheese and crackersThe Happening
","The premise for The Happening is intriguing as hellMother Nature using its natural defense mechanisms to fight back against humanity. By releasing a neurotoxin, everything green has decided to show its true strength; earth will not rollover and watch itself get suffocated anymore. This synopsis alone shows the environmentalist bent being portrayed, but very unobtrusively. Sure the groundwork is there, ever prevalent, lurking below the surface, but credit Shyamalan for refusing to make it the centerpiece of the taleuntil the end of course. I wish he would have trusted us as an audience a bit more in that regard. The visuals are handled with deft precision, the wind and flowing foliage is gorgeous to experience, yet completely frightening at the same time. The detail and fluidity of realism is a feat to behold, but once you realize the intent of that motion, you want to turn and run yourself. If nothing else, Shymalan is a definite master of mood and enveloping his audience into the world he creates. Whereas a film like Signs shows his manipulation too strongly, leading us by the hand, step by step, to the end, Night has definitely honed this skill by putting us into the world in order for ourselves to end up where he wants us, thinking we got there all on our own. This is what makes The Village resonate with me so much, he never tried to trick me, he just let me wander in and uncover the secrets. He does much the same here with our fears of terrorism and closed-minded views when it comes to the far-fetched (Mother Nature fighting? Yeah right). By showing how each character reacts to what is happening, we are allowed to pick the one we agree with and see how he/she will fare and find out what is really going on.The problems come in with the uneven tempo and mood that's laid out. This is a dark story of death and destruction, containing moments that are not for the faint of heart. Believe me, when you see our leads travel with a certain age demographic you will get lulled into the sense of security that, oh, now nothing will happen. I'll just warn you that anything can and will occur, despite any preconceptions you may have. However, with that cynicism and unabashed freedom to carry the story to any end, Night decided he needed to temper it all with comedy and humor. While a little of this is a plus, he goes overboard here. Some moments are cringingly bad to watch and make you wonder how he didn't cut the scene completely, or why no one recommended that he do so. Yes, there was the unintentional humor brought to the forefront by the crowd I saw the film with, but some of the stuff was just too over the top that it must have been done on purpose. I truly believed Shymalan told his actors to ham it up for some end game, but when nothing resulted, (no Haunted Honeymoon sequence when you find that all the craziness and camp was a result of the entire film being a radio show), I only had to blame the cast for its amateur sensibilities and the director for his inability to get the performances needed.Before I go into detail, I just want to mention the one person who got it right. John Leguizamo is absolutely fantastic in a smaller role as a math teacher. He embodies the role and the responsibilities his family life carries with it to perfection. Start to finish, not a single false moment. This cannot be said for anyone else. Zooey Deschanel has instances of brilliance, but also way too many of her manic jittering and wide-eyed stares that work so well as the drugged out hippie in 'Weeds' but not so much as the emotionally troubled wife here. Mark Wahlberg is half great, half bad. When he has his moments of levity, pretending to be that cool teacher goofing around while subliminally still teaching something, he reminded me of his delivery from I Heart Huckabees. Where he fails is when he attempts to be a normal suburbanite. Truthfully, he can't pull it off. He is from the streets, his speech patterns are from the streets, and he should not be made to pretend to be Johnny Do Good. All he does is inflect words that make him appear to have a weird staccato and horrible grasp on the English languageit's too forced.So, while visually stunning and intriguingly plotted, the end result becomes too campy to hold the weight that Night sets out to have. The scientific stuff if interesting and handled well enough to be believable, never taking us out of the world we are transported too. I also loved the 'Twilight Zone'-esquire conclusion, showing the bigger picture of what really is happening. Whether it was just cast wrong or played wrong, the acting is too stilted at times, the script uneven and laughableDo you like hotdogs?and in the end disjointed enough to sometimes lose your footing on what is happening. Humor is necessary to allow the darkness to breathe, not to take us off course only to steer back sharply. There are the makings of a very good film here, I just think maybe a bit more work was needed to excise it from what finally hit the screen.",5,1,6,14 June 2008
The Fountain," Death breeds creationThe Fountain
","I never thought I would ever thank Brad Pitt for causing the utter failure of The Fountain launching principal photography three years ago. However, his leaving the production to do Troy may have resulted in the finest film-going experience I have ever had. Darren Aronofsky's masterpiece could only have been ruined by the doubled budget and lack of Hugh Jackman and Rachel Weisz's stellar performances. The epic scope this film has is that much better due to the small-scale effects honed and enlarged to full utilization. Much like this, Tom and Izzi's quest for eternal life spans mankind yet could be found inside themselves if they only looked hard enough. The Fountain is definitely a fantasy for adults and helps show the world the lengths we will go for love and how it can blind us to what truly matters in that most precious of unions.One can't truly explain this film; it is an experience that must be seen firsthand to even begin to fathom the effect it can have on the viewer. Aronofsky has crafted a tale of love through the pain of death. Hugh Jackman is a neurosurgeon desperately trying to discover a way to decrease the growth of tumors. While on a mission to help prevent death and disease in the world, he also must find a way to save his dying wife from the cancer that has begun taking its hold on her. The looming death set before Izzi, played with pure emotion by Rachel Weisz, has been accepted, yet can't be by her husband who knows he can cure her if he just had more time. Jackman is a shattered man on a quest which once started together, but now finishes alone. The futility of his situation cannot sink in and as a result he must continue on while his wife lays dying, trying her hardest to let him understand what is to come in the future. She shares her novel about a conquistador on a journey for Eden's Tree of Life, telling him that he needs to write the conclusion. The quest along the road to awe has been laid out for Tom and it is up to him to decide what he will do when he comes face to face with destiny. This surgeon will come to a choice where he will have to either choose finding the end of death, planting a tree to gather his wife's spirit for an afterlife through an ancient Mayan tale of Seebalba, or allow himself to accept that finality and hope for a continuing to life beyond it.While at first it may seem a bit convoluted and pretentious, this story is a simple one. Love binds us to each other and pulls a veil over the big picture when it does not concern the survival of our union. Instead of cherishing the time we have together on Earth, we would rather waste it all in desperate attempts to prolong our stay. Much like Adam and Eve being thrown from Eden for wanting more than each other, Tom and Izzi are at the point of their journey where they can eat the fruit and risk losing everything, or they can take a step back and live for the moment. We all face this challenge throughout our lives, and will continue to as the years go by. Darren Aronofsky shows us the problem as far back as the Spanish Inquisition, as far forward as the end of time being pulled into the nebular entrance to eternity, and at the present day, here and now. Izzi relates to the beauty of ancient Mayan tales of the afterlife and through her writings on a past life, sparks her husband's mind to imagine the journey through time and the road of disappointment it will lead him on. That road needs to be taken, however, for without the knowledge of pain and failure, one will never see that he must look inside himself for the answers that will bring him back to his love. When Jackman finally realizes what must happen, he expresses sheer joy and relief that his story has come to close, yet his life has been reborn for eternity.After his genius with previous films Pi and Requiem for a Dream, it is hard to believe that Aronofsky could enhance the medium of cinema even further. While others take from past visionaries and apply their findings to their own work, Aronofsky creates those new ways that will be adopted in the future. He is an innovator and with his work here takes another step closer, if not to totally justifying the call by some that he is the new Stanley Kubrick. Each step of The Fountain is orchestrated to the utmost detail and the symphony is one for the ages. Along with Clint Mansell's haunting score, Badalamenti to Darren's Lynch, this tale is one for all senses. The palpability and lushness of the effects in the future scenes are a feat to behold. Crossing between three time periods is daunting in itself, yet in the final minutes, going through each at breakneck speed leading to the tale's culmination is brilliant. No one else has the eye to make every banal, static shot seem magical and full of life. With seamless dissolves and gorgeous compositions, The Fountain is a feast for the eyes, intriguing at ever turn. However, the true magic lies in the story being told, one that will break your heart while simultaneously breathing a hope for everlasting love inside of you.",10,5,10,22 November 2006
It's a Wonderful Life," George lassos the moonIt's a Wonderful Life
","I don't know how I went 23 years of Christmas without having It's a Wonderful Life playing during the holiday season. Last year I saw the film for the first time on the big screen at the Screening Room in Amherst. Once again, as it seems to have become a yearly tradition there, I have found myself loving it just as much the second time this year. Frank Capra has put a masterpiece onto celluloid here, and that is quite a feat for a holiday niche film. Never dull, always heartwarming, funny, and true, It's a Wonderful Life is truly one of cinema's shining achievements.Sure there is the whole cliché of seeing the world as though you have never existed; the waking up to show how important life is to so many. It's a rendition of Dickens yet spun in a way that makes it its own. The entire film could have run with the gimmick and created a complete story from it, as numerous reinterpretations have doneMr. Destiny, The Family Man, etchowever, that would have been the cheap way out. Instead the filmmakers have started us at the end, a tragedy has occurred and a man's faith in life is waning. Prayers have been sent above and the Gods have decided to send down an angel to help our hero out of his predicament. Well this angel knows nothing about George Bailey, so for the first three quarters of the movie we go along for the ride to catch up on the life of this great man, just as our angel Clarence does the same. We are shown the life of a man who has given the whole of his being for those around him. With naught a selfish bone in his body, George continues to sacrifice his happiness for the joy to see his friends jubilant. Through his good deeds, he eventually wakes up to the treasures of life that have been in front of him the whole time and really takes a small town from the Depression to a close-knit, successful society. It is almost too difficult to think he could be in so much trouble that he would be contemplating suicide, but once again we see his caring nature come through in that trying, desperate moment. When the story finally catches up to itself we learn that the predicament he is in is actually one of another that he has taken responsibility for in order to see if he can't solve the town's problems again.James Stewart is a revelation here. The self-deprecating nature is prevalent at all times, and the intellect his character contains juxtaposes nicely with the humor and goodnaturedness. Stewart is George Bailey, as the role fully encompasses his being. Every nuance of emotion is etched to his face as he goes from wide-eyed explorer to smitten lover, responsible adult, compassionate son and brother, loving husband and father, beaten failure, and finally redeemed hero and friend to all men and women he has ever come across. Of course what hero can exist without a nemesis of equal power whose immense strength comes from evil? Here we have the loathed Mr. Potter played brilliantly by Lionel Barrymore. I don't think anyone who has ever seen this film can have any real compassion for this man who is truly a scrooge to all. People are numbers and figures to him, which need to be conquered and claimed as his own. Barrymore is despicably slimy and true to his character at all times. There must also be mention of the beautiful Donna Reed as our protagonist's love interest. Her striking beauty and self-assuredness shows why George Bailey could be so taken by her, always getting distracted away from his dreams of leaving Bedford Falls. The sexual tension between Reed and Stewart throughout begins humorously at a dance and after when drenched with water and culminates in a serious and real moment as the love takes over during a phone conversation with an old friend. The relationship is believable from start to finish, portrayed even by the young actors who played their roles as children.True there is a segmented population during Christmas time containing those who watch A Christmas Story, those with a love for Christmas Vacation, and those championing It's a Wonderful Life among many others. I must say that I have been converted to Capra's classic film and would have no problem watching it every Christmas for the rest of my life. The story means a lot of things to many people and has been remade countless times in many forms, (there are chunks of time here which show how even Back to the Future II is ripping it off completely). If you want a perfectly written and acted tale of the joy of giving and the strength of friendship to help show the true meaning of Christmas, look no further than this gem that has endured for 60 years. Yes, I will be purchasing the newly released 60th anniversary DVDsometimes waiting half a century has its benefits as the first copy I own will be the definitive package available.",10,1,5,16 December 2006
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," What if we leave and you're wrong?  Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen
","My screening of Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen ended around 10:00pm. What do we see in the lobby as we exit the theatre? That's right, a line already forming for the midnight show, less than two hours away, the premiere timeslot to expose the world to the ancient Decepticon Fallen. Those kids were ready for a good time, hoping that the sequel lived up to the surprisingly effective first installment. If any of them had asked me as I walked by what I thought, I would have told them the truth  it's not that bad. In hindsight, I think I gave the original too high a rating with an 8/10. It did entertain and the computer graphics were impeccable, but too often did it have me shaking my head at the clumsy script and abundance of cheese. It was a crapshoot on what to expect with a sequel from maestro of destruction Michael Bay. All I knew for sure was that he'd bring more robots, more explosions, and more carnage, because, frankly, that's how he rolls.Let's put this phenomenon in perspective here. Not only are all local theatres playing a midnight show—yes, even the drive-in—but tomorrow's 'first day' screenings begin at 10:00am. It's a Wednesday people. I understand it's the summer and most kids are off of school, but one can imagine how many people lining up in the morning are playing hooky from work too. This thing will be breaking the bank for sure, despite the early, mostly derisive, reviews. The people that will be pumping money into Hollywood's coffers aren't likely to be reading those critical analyses anyway. No, instead they are probably going to see it again. In all honesty, I don't blame them one bit. If I were a serious critic, looking at this thing in comparison with the great movies of all time, nitpicking every minute detail, I'd probably be hailing it as one of the worst motion pictures ever. But I am not, and I won't. Transformers 2 is a heck of a lot of fun and I can say with a straight face that, if you enjoyed the first, you will have a blast with the second.The movie brings what you'd expect from Bay—more of everything. There is a ton more action, mostly robot versus robot fighting, that intrigues immensely. I could have gone without the quips and stupid catchphrases as they throw each other, but that is a minor quibble. Even the comedic aspect is increased, and as someone who thought the first was too campy, this actually isn't a bad thing. The humor is shored up and more honed with less headshaking and more laughing. Even little inside jokes thrown in, like a Bad Boys II poster hanging in Sam's dorm room, sparks a chuckle. I was also beginning to think that John Turturro redeemed himself for a dismally weak performance in the first until they had to put him underneath a robot with two hanging metal orbs, to which he spoke over the radio, 'I'm beneath the robot scrotum'. It was a very poor error in judgment, but, of course, the audience ate it up, along with the twins Mudflap and Skids. I don't know what was more offensive, the ghetto-bots' blatant caricature boarding on racist or the fact that every time Tyrese Gibson was on screen he was saying 'that can't be good'.The true success here, however, is that the story revolves around the Transformers. If the first film was about Earth and humanity's discovery of this alien race, the sequel is about that race and what it is they are doing here. It is a time for them to prove themselves and show that the trust humanity has given is earned. As a result, we get a ton of computer-generated robotics to brilliant effect. The robots came to Earth to harvest its sun for energy, only to discover life, realizing they must find another sun because they will not destroy a civilization. Except that one Prime decided to stay and reap the power, forever being called Fallen, exiled by the other Primes and blocked from his takeover. That means the Harvester is buried, the matrix key guarded, and Fallen is in hiding awaiting a chance to return. Once Sam touches a remnant of the All-Spark, well, the map to destruction is embedded in his head and the search for Earth's survival is on. Yes, the mythology is convoluted, but if you buy into an alien race of robots coming to our world, well the plot will fall into place too.So, yeah, the faults of the first are shored up pretty well, but the story loses something in the process. For being over two hours, the end comes with the realization that not much had happened, leaving us with an Optimus Prime voice-over, making us wonder if we accidentally just watched the first film again. Who goes to a Michael Bay film for the strong story, though, right? You go for a good time, an escape from the challenges of our world to watch the little guy defeat an impossible foe and save the world. Bay is the master of escapism and Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen is one more feather in his cap. You know what to expect and it will be delivered, so just sit back, relax, and enjoy a new adventure, much like the previous, but this time full of robotic goodness from front to back.",5,2,8,23 June 2009
Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist," TIFF 08: Where's Fluffy? Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist
","What do you get when you cast Michael Cera as an awkward late-teen/quasi-geek; a sassy, smart, attractive girl who is a better catch then she thinks; a killer Indie soundtrack; and comedic side characters that deliver the goods? Juno? Not quite. What we get is Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist, which debuted at the Toronto International Film Festival. It is a real good time; maybe not as fresh or original as one would hope, the laughs are there and the story is enough to hold your attention. Taking place during the course of one night in New York City, searching for an elusive band's secret gig, two lost souls find each other and discover what love is despite the preconceptions they had before meeting. Reminiscent to me of Adventures in Babysittingthe journey's detours and mood, not the storySollett enhances the based-on-a-book script with songs on 'five star' rotation from his iPod, (he told us after the screening, it's true), and some great work with his actors to stay realistic and keep all that awkwardness of adolescence intact as these young kids open up and find out who they really are.It's an interesting twist on a common premiseguy gets dumped by girl and makes a series of 'break-up' mixes, leaving them at her door, complete with handmade packaging. The egotistical brat ex-girlfriend Tris is, each disc is carefully discarded only after showing how sad Nick is losing such a great girl as she. Enter fringe outcast Norah to scoop up the discs and discover how their maker has her exact taste in music and may be her soulmate, without even knowing who he is. That set-up can only lead to a chance encounter at said sadsack's next gig with his band, completed by his two gay friends on vocals and guitar. Norah sees Nick onstage, has a connection to him and eventually cons her way into using him as a fake boyfriend to prove she isn't a loser to Tris. Only she doesn't know that he is her Nickoh the battle is on as the trio discovers the relationship each has with the other and both girls embark on a journey to win the geek over. Wow, if only real life could be this good for the nerdy sadsacks  only in Hollywood.While Nick and Norah slowly open their eyes to each other and see how compatible they are and Tris journeys on her mission to grab her ex back, (no way can he go from her to Norah), we also follow Caroline's drunken stupor through the city. Known to have specific places to throw-up in, Norah enlists Nick's bandmates to help her find the lost and clueless friend while also hoping to uncover Where's Fluffy?'s concert location. Our cast of characters here meet up with some interesting creatures. Sollett spoke how he tried to get each locale to be that from the book, actual East Village/Lower East Side haunts he himself frequents. They all needed authenticity in detail and therefore needed waitresses of equal loathing and bands that would actual play there. The look and feel are definitely genuine and help give us, as an audience, the ability to believe it all despite the conveniently contrived plot progressions utilized.The supporting characters we meet are usually a lot of fun, especially cameos from Kevin Corrigan, (he does wonders without even uttering a word), and Andy Samberg, (a riot as a homeless man Cera's Nick stumbles upon at a church around 3am). Sollett spoke of Samberg's willingness to improv and the multiple takes filmed. His favorite alternate take was hilarious and probably better than what was used, but this is a film trying to get a PG-13 rating, so all you out there will have to wait for the DVD to hopefully see a gag reel. I really hope it gets on there because I'd love to see Cera's reaction to the raunchy exchange. The larger cameos, those of friends on screen often, are very effective as well. Aaron Yoo and Rafi Gavron are fantastic as Cera's bandmates/best friends, trying to show him that Norah is the girl he wants, not Tris, while also just having a good time being themselves  never pushing the gay comedy far enough into stereotypical drivel. Ari Graynor is wonderful as Caroline, inebriated throughout, she brings some big laughs and a few cringes, especially when playing off her wad of chewing gum, a character worthy of credit itself.The true winner of the film, though, besides the amazing soundtrack of people you will probably start hearing about with their next albums as the mainstream moves to include them, is Norah herself, Kat Dennings. This girl is perfect for the role. She is cute in a humble, 'I don't think I am' kind of way, with a biting wit and sarcastic defenses. She is the kind of girl you would fight for, but also the one that will not make it easy for you to win. Intellectual and unassuming, she shies away from her father's fameyou should figure out his job early on, but I don't want to be the one to ruin the revealand attempts to be original, much like Juno and even Jaye from TV-show 'Wonderfalls'. Her exchanges with Cera are always endearingly funny, if not laugh out loudlove when she drives his carand while the awkwardness gets overplayed, ruining some of the chemistry, you do want to see them get together in the end. Not because you know they probably will, but because you agree with Yoo and Gavron, she is the one for Nick and nothing should stand in the way. Oh, the power of music, Sollett has something with his idea to use breakup tapes as unknowing relationship builders. It may not be as good as those it tries to copy, but it definitely deserves a place snuggly next to them.",8,16,28,8 September 2008
30 Days of Night," Where's my phone?30 Days of Night
","Here is the next chapter in the graphic novels cum film movement that has been taking over the industry. The ingredients seem pretty foolproof: a revisionist vampire tale screenwritten by the novel's authors, a setting without the sun for thirty days, a hard-r rating, a good cast, and visionary music video director David Slade fresh off his debut feature Hard Candy. 30 Days of Night is a brutal look into a world where the monsters reign supreme with little in their way to slow them down. With stunning cinematography, a beautiful washed out/dark cool color palette, realistic gore with unflinching detail, and a dark empty void of happiness, this one looked like a winner all the way. That is, until the ending. It is a shame that a story as hardcore as this one would take the path it does at the conclusion. Something a bit more tongue-in-cheek or satirical could have easily gotten away with it, but this one deserved to be allowed to run its course of brutality without a convenient finish putting a bittersweet smile on our faces before the lights turned back on, releasing us from the hold of Alaska's darkest moments.I can't say anything bad about the directing. Slade has shown again that style can add a lot to a visionary tale such as this. He is given more room to move as opposed to the two leads, one venue he had for the brilliant Hard Candy, but still closed in enough to be able to create an aesthetic that didn't need to change. The entire film takes place in the town of Barrow, amongst the houses, stores, and streets with the everyone knows everyone cast of locals. The Stranger who treks into town cuts them off from civilization and keeps the director trapped inside as well to find inventive places to shoot. Complete with jerky, frame missing attack scenes, Slade does not disappoint when it comes to eye candy. Close-ups abound and his ability to keep the camera on the casualties while they are chalked up is a bold breath of fresh air. Very few moments are actual scary jolts. This film's true fear creator is in the unabashed view of all the carnage at work.Staying on course, visually speaking, you have never seen vampires depicted quite like this. Their faces are distorted and smooth without blemishes. I have not read the books, so I don't know how much these creatures are manifestations of the artwork, but I couldn't help see the similarities to the beasties in videos by music group Aphex Twin. While the beings I'm thinking of were in the promos by Chris Cunningham, Slade too directed some of the band's work. Not only were the facial structures otherworldlyvery fallen angelbut the blank stares and open mouths they possessed showed a detached side to them as they were only out for blood. This is a dying race not attempting to expand their legions, but instead to just survive. I loved the one bald creature with blood on its face throughout the film. He was so memorable because the blood almost created a five-o'clock shadow on his face.Credit all involved, and the actor himself, for getting Danny Huston into this film. He is amazing as the lead vampire Marlow. I thought the foreign language was a stroke of genius, but it is his mannerisms that really allow the part to succeed. The mouth breathing is foreboding and creepy, dried blood keeps adding upon his face, and his eyes are made up of a continuous blank stare. Someone as accomplished as he is in supporting roles should be commended for taking a role such as this and performing it seriously. This is no Bela Lugosi, as one character says, this is a malicious being out for survival amongst a race that he knows is inferior to his own.As for the other actors, it is a pretty good job across the board. Josh Hartnett is surprisingly competent. I attribute that to the fact that he is mostly shown with a stoic, contemplative face. If there is one thing he does well, that is it. It's usually when he smiles and tries to be mister cool that he falters, but thankfully he never really gets that chance here. Ben Foster shows again that no one can do what he doesno one, and Melissa George shows she is an interesting actress whom I have not been able to see yet. Not quite sure if I liked her completely, but she didn't do anything to make me think I shouldn't have. Also, it's a pleasure to see Mark Boone Junior take on a role that lasts. Too many only have like five minutes of screen time (Batman Begins) and he is better than that.Again, though, the ending just left me cold. Sure what happens as a result stays true to the event, it is just the event itself that made me cringe. Harnett's sheriff must make a decision before his whole town and all he cares about goes up in flames. Up until that point, the movie had been an edge of your seat thrill ride where it seemed that no one was too important to die. I was even starting to smile that I might be getting a fully tragic end devoid of survivors. Unfortunately, the sheriff makes a decision so out of left field that it elicited more chuckles than poignant tears as a more thought out sequence might have. It doesn't totally derail an otherwise solid genre flick, but it does leave just the right amount of bile in your throat to sully what comes before it with a faint bad taste.",7,2,6,23 October 2007
There Will Be Blood," I will bury you undergroundThere Will Be Blood
","There Will Be Blood is a staggering work of genius. Paul Thomas Anderson has, if he hadn't already, cemented himself as the director of the present and future. While his previous work compared to the great Robert Altman, this entry is by all accounts his Kubrick picture. At every turn I could think of nothing else but comparisons to Stanley Kubrick's body of work. The cold, detached artistry of it, the gorgeous visuals bolstered by powerhouse performances, and the patience with which to allow a story of this kind to ferment and show itself, are all characteristics fusing them. Here comes the shocker, thoughand it is not more of a shock to anyone but myselfI think it is his worst film as far as my emotive connection to it. Now, I'll add that even his worst is better than 99% of the films made in a year, but a disappointment is still just that. What really pains me, however, is the fact that it is an almost flawless piece of art. At every moment I can only think of perfection, yet a void to why it is so. It is an issue of brilliant parts whose sum just doesn't add up. If nothing else, this film may make me change the way I look at cinema. There has been no other film that effected me as much as this, no other that will stick with me longer after my viewing; it should earn movie of the year for just that alone. Hitting on so many levels it unfortunately leaves me in confusion at the end. Much like Kubrick's 'masterpiece' Barry Lyndonfor which I thought of more than once sitting there todaythis is a piece of work that will be studied and dissected and copied for years to come. Technically perfect, it has everything it needs except my adoration. Leaving me cold, I just can't wrap my head around it.Anderson has my undivided appreciation for what he has done. Visually stunning, I cannot think of one bad moment. Even with the audience I saw it with laughing at inappropriate moments there were no faults. Being able to touch people in that way, making them so uneasy and uncomfortable that it is necessary to release the built up tension with a laugh only strengthens the argument of its greatness. It actually makes me angry that I can't just say screw it, I loved it, best film I've ever seen.At its core, this is a tale of one man's complete and utter descent into hell. What once was a man of integrity and hard work becomes one filled with greed and hubris, flying too high and unable to feel the slow burn of his wings. Daniel Day-Lewis is allowed every reprieve thrown his way. The ability he has to embody so completely every character he portrays is astounding. Taking four years off between films is not only acceptable, it is necessary in order for the audience to recover from his brilliance, let alone his own needs to gain back the energy and life left on the celluloid. The devil is most definitely inside of Daniel Planview; unable to trust or love those closest to him, he sees the loneliness and solitude awaiting. Beginning on his own in 1898falling down a well and breaking his leg without help around for mileshe will eventually find that same detachment in 1927, although he is surrounded by wealth and creatures on the payroll. A family business for sure, it just takes a little while to notice that his family consists of only one member.The supporting roles are all superbly fleshed out, each plays his piece of the puzzle, helping build to the inevitable conclusion, bringing to mind another Kubrick classic The Shining. One person truly succeeds at attempting to match Day-Lewis's dedication to the work, though, and he is Paul Dano. Actually cast during production, after the letting go of the actor who had already begun filming as Eli Sunday, Dano is scary as the prophet for the Church of the Third Revelation. His sermons are difficult to watch and powerful beyond belief. When he and Day-Lewis share the screen, you can't even imagine what might happen next. The spite and hatred brewing beneath both exteriors is palpable, ready to spill over at any moment. Words cannot describe the effectiveness of their relationship, both very much similar in opposite ways, tasting evil and relishing its desserts.At almost three hours in length, I couldn't believe it when it had ended; the pace is break-neck. Even more remarkable is the fact that much of the film is told in silence, save for Jonny Greenwood's haunting and disjointed score, (reminiscent to an episode of 'Lost'), with just actions and scenery to progress the plot. With the first twenty or so minutes to be completely wordless and still create a complete background for the Plainview role, I can't comprehend the genius that is PT Anderson. Sure he owes plenty to the masters that came before him, but one can't doubt his skill and artistry here. He has my full respect and I will be seeing this film again, most likely multiple times, in the future because there is perfection at work. I give him full benefit of the doubt; it is me who is broken. Nothing this glorious can be any less than the best and if I can't see it now, it is I who needs to be shown where I have gone wrong.",8,0,3,16 January 2008
To Kill a Mockingbird," Stand up, your father's passingTo Kill a Mockingbird
","While enjoying many novels that I read during my stint in the public school system, Harper Lee's classic To Kill a Mockingbird was always one of the most memorable. The story was beautifully told and showed a great example of moral fiber. Atticus Finch is the epitome of class and trust. He sees past age, race, intelligence and instead views the soul. After watching this film you might start believing that people really are inherently good.Perusing through the list of films that director Robert Mulligan sat behind the camera on shows me that maybe this film was his masterpiece. I have never seen nor heard of the rest of his filmography, (not to say he doesn't have any other gems in that list, I just wouldn't be able to tell you their names). He seems to be a very capable director, however, as the movie is shot quite well. The contrast of the black and white during many night scenes is effective and he does a good job framing the actors as they do their thing. There aren't any effects shots or skewed angles; Mulligan allows his cast to carry the film and that is a good move. The story is strong and the words are what matter most.Gregory Peck is just as good as everyone says he is here. He embodies Atticus completely, as a strong willed man of the community, a shrewd and moral man of the law, and a caring, loving father. Peck displays the many facets of his character as he treats all with the same care. His children call him by his first name and wander around the town alone. To Atticus, they are just as independently responsible as himhow can he second-guess his own children? Speaking of those children, it is hard to believe that both Scout and Jem are played by first-time actors. The kids, Mary Badham and Phillip Alford, are amazing. They act well beyond their years, showing the teaching that goes on at home behind the scenes. Not only are they intelligent, but they can watch out for themselves. Scout is not afraid to pick a fight if she believes someone close to her has had his/her honor called into question, and no matter how much Jem chides his sister for being too much of a girl, he is always there to defuse hostile situations and make sure his sibling is unharmed. Both child actors are very effective in their line delivery and most noticeably in their facial expressions. It sometimes appears that their reactions are about to go over the top, but they have the ability to keep it all grounded to reality. The most fun is their stubborn fear of neighbor Boo Radley, whom they've never met. Although shown very briefly, and without a single line of dialogue, Robert Duvall, also making his film debut, (which surprised me as I thought his premiere was THX-1138 since it almost seemed like a collegiate film, but in fact was filmed nine years later), is very convincing as the troubled young man who has come out of seclusion to help resolve the incident which takes place at the movie's finale. Talk about speaking and emoting through only your body language; one knows exactly what Boo is thinking thanks to Duvall's performance.To Kill a Mockingbird never drags throughout its duration. Even for someone who has read the novel, everything occurs with suspense and spontaneity. While yes, the climax in the courthouse is the shining moment, all that bookends the sequence is just as enjoyable. Gregory Pecks' closing statement to the jury is magnificent however. His powerful performance almost made me want to stand with those watching on screen as he left through the door upon the verdict. Atticus Finch truly is the greatest screen hero of all time.",9,2,4,10 August 2006
The Last King of Scotland," Do you have monkeys in Scotland?The Last King of Scotland
","What happens when a precocious young doctor gets a feeling of claustrophobia at home and decides to travel the world to bring help while having fun in the process? Kevin Macdonald's The Last King of Scotland tries to show us the answers in the midst of Idi Amin's rise to power in Uganda. While not a biopic, the film is also not a narrative fiction of any real weight. Instead this is a tale of a monster through the eyes of someone whose innocence thought what was happening was for the good of all until it was too late to turn back. Idi Amin is not the star of the showalthough he does steal virtually every scene he's init's the young doctor's evolution at the hands of the viciousness he was sheltered from in his childhood that drives the plot. When one is not quite world weary and still under the impression that they are invincible to atrocity, they can easily be duped into following what they see up close rather than what is happening around them.James McAvoy does a wonderful job as the young doctor going to Uganda to lend his assistance and find some adventure along the way. He is rebelling against the life he should be leading in Scotland as a family doctor at the side of his father. That is not the life he wants to be living so soon in his career and thus spins the globe to find his next destination. While in the African country, he takes part in the hard job of being one of two doctors trying to help all the unfortunate poor of the nation. Upon a chance meeting with the new president, General Amin, he is given the opportunity to become the man's personal physician. McAvoy is fantastic at showing the utter happiness at being looked upon as someone who can help a nation by this seemingly great man. He begins to enjoy his post, lives with all perks available to him, (I loved the transition from utter squalor of the countryside to the wealth of urban areas in the capital, as I never expected to see that upper crust side to the African scenery here), and becomes the leader's closest adviser on all matters whether or not medically pertinent. It is his great job during the high times that really show how good of an actor he is once the lid is lifted to reveal all the atrocities that have been happening right under his nose. What once began as a job of missionary work becomes a trial to see if he can stay alive long enough to leave the country while his friend and boss becomes more and more unstable in his sightline, characteristics he hid so effectively during the courtship process of recruiting his skills.No matter how good McAvoy is, though, he is no match for Forest Whitaker's powerhouse performance as the larger-than-life Amin. Sure there is a lot of talk going around that the Scot is the real star here with the general a supporting player, (as far as awards go), however, Whitaker is on screen for a good three quarters of the film and definitely deserves to be considered in the Best Actor categories. Just because the film does not necessarily revolve around his character, he is still a co-star before being relegated a supporter. I have always been a Whitaker fan, from his small roles like that in Fast Times, to measured dramatic perfection in season 5 of 'The Shield,' to the more unique roles like Ghost Dog. Nothing he has done, though, can prepare you for the magic he brings to the screen here. You get every side of this monster from his compassion for the people of Ugandaalbeit those that are on his sidethe utter charm and charisma that was used to get not only those around him as friends but also the British government to support his coup of the nation, to the animosity that could brim to the surface without the slightest provocation. Watching him go from happy-go-lucky to a maniacal rants of insane paranoia, cutting short even those he just finished praising, is amazing. The smile could charm even the most skeptical cynic, but I think what someone says in the movie is true; he is a child and that is what makes him so scary.Sure these two performances make the movie a joy to watch, but the film itself somewhat lacks in substance. Through the middle of the film, we see the conflict bubbling to the surface many times; yet while being different, serve to give the same context to the viewers. All this monotony is eventually redeemed at the conclusion. I truly will say that I never expected what happened. Yes, I figured what transpired would, but I didn't think it would go down quite the way it did. I applaud Macdonald for never shying away from the true impetus of this film; he brought to the table a story of a monster disguised as a great man and showed how it all could unravel without flinching. His use of grainy camera-work adds to the documentary-like style and the close-ups of actors covered in the sweat and dirt of Africa showed the realism and truth of the place. He was also able to get great performances from all his supporting cast, from the extras playing regular townsfolk and army men, the Ugandans surrounding Amin, (especially David Oyelowo as another doctor), a nice show of talent from usual standard-fare actress Kerry Washington, and a surprisingly real and emotively bottled representation of a woman who trapped herself into the life she led by Gillian Anderson. All in all, this film is a must see for the actors alone, yet also has a riveting story to watch progress until its inevitable conclusion.",9,3,4,20 January 2007
August Rush," The music is all around us; all you have to do is listenAugust Rush
","This is a fairytale above anything else and one should overlook any eccentricities or impossibilities of real life, this is not meant to show truth. Instead we are shown a romantic tale of conquering all odds in order to reunite lost souls, whether that be a child and his parents, a man and a woman who shared a night long ago, a social worker and his belief in the power of love, or a homeless musical talent with the knowledge that there are still people out there listening, not just learning from books and how to imitate, but truly listening to the sounds around them and creating art for the love of music itself. Because as we all know, you must 'love music more than food, more than even yourself.' This film had great potential when I saw the trailer, but I never really thought it could ever live up to it. I saw it falling into the Hollywood pitfalls of convenience and laziness, making everything overly sentimental and dripping with saccharine. Now, there's a fair share of those moments, yet I never minded one bit because the heart was always at the forefront. Being so instilled with an otherworldly quality and fairytale mystic, nothing seems out of place. One needs those moments of coincidence and chance bringing paths together along the way. Sure it happens in real life, but in the stories told to us as children it occurs all the time. We as kids need those common tomes and roads intertwining in order to wrap our minds around the cause of all the inevitable happiness. Fate brings good things together in these types of tales and for that reason each moment rings absolutely truethat is if you let the story take you over and buy into its magic.Sheridan orchestrates the visual music to perfection. When our star, Evan Taylor/August Rush, played by Freddie Highmore, hears the world around him making their songs, it is stunning to behold. The quick cuts from shoes on the street, basketballs on the chain netting, steam emitted from smokestacks, etc, bring each symphony into reality. Even those moments when he sets his eyes on an instrument for the first time, intuitively knowing how to play it, make you believe his pure joy in the act and his genius in order to play what he does. Highmore is quite the talent and I'm not sure how to take what I have heard recently about him saying he will quit acting once he grows up. For one I have all the respect in the world for that decision, stop with the success now and make a life for yourself instead of fighting through the pressure and criticisms of never being as good older as you were in the past. However, I can't help but think he may have some greatness left in him that we may never be able to experience.As for the tale itself, we are treated with the union of two musicians lost on their way to adulthood. A rockstar unsure of the life he is being asked to live and a Julliard trained cellist attempting to reconcile her love for the craft with the hatred of her father forcing her into it. Their love brings forth a child that they will never know, yet who will never give up in the search to find them. With music as the canvas connecting them all together, they journey out of the safe lives they have lived, following the music eleven years later in order to see if the happiness they once knew could still be out there for the taking. It really is a gorgeous tale of love and hope, sprinkled with some visual panache and the unabashed confidence to let songs, both lyrical and instrumental, bolster the proceedings into a concert of vibrancy.Keri Russell and Jonathan Rhys Meyers both are wonderful as the torn lovers finding themselves and eventually the desire to find each other again. I was very surprised to see that Rhys Meyers actually sang his own songs being that the lip-synching was so horrible, but I don't want that to hamper my viewing of the use of music here. Every performance is believable and well done. Even the guitar slapping, something I have never seen before, is quite mesmerizing to behold. Terrence Howard brings a nice role to the story as well, playing the social worker trying to work as a liaison between all parties, always with the best interests of the child in mind. And of course there is Robin Williams. His role is a far cry from the one that is fleshed out in the trailer. While he does what he can to help the boy, his motives are not as wholesome as you may expect in the beginning. Attempting to live out the fantasy of success he must have always had in life, he begins to put the boy's best interests into the backseat. It leads to some powerful moments and he does a great job with the tough role.Through it all, though, everything that happens leads into the climax of the film. What a scene that is too. Starting with the concerts of both Russell and Rhys Meyers, on different sides of NYC, and Highmore underground awaiting his next move while his debut begins above him, we are led full circle through all the relationships that have been brought forth. Every character finally becomes that which they have been workings towardsmention should be made for Leon G. Thomas III as Arthur with some fantastic work. Yes, the conclusion is obvious, but it is also the perfect ending to the story. There are no epilogues or embraces of happiness, instead we get what we deserve, a final instance of music bringing the world together and helping lovers find their way.",8,1,2,17 March 2008
American Gangster," My manAmerican Gangster
","I've been hearing that American Gangster is just your run-of-the-mill cop vs. robber flick, again showing Ridley Scott's prevailing mediocrity. Hey, I love the cast and I find Scott almost as intriguing as his brother, so I was all for it. Generic gangsters with Denzel Washington and Russell Crowe should still be better than most. However, while finding it to be unoriginal, I didn't see it as a crime film. Instead it was one of my least favorite genres, the biopic. We are shown Frank Lucas go from driver of Harlem's bigshot to king of the drug world and Richie Roberts from beat cop/law student to drug investigator head/prosecuting lawyer. Rather than give us all conflict, we get sequence after sequence of how these two got where they get. Not only that, but I couldn't tell you at the end who was the good guy and who the bad. Both men are glorified and shown to have enemies that they vault over because of character, whether moral or not. They both beat the odds, and honestly, I liked Denzel's Lucas as a person more than Crowe's Roberts.There is just too much going on here. How many times do we need to see Robert's boyscout mentality and Lucas' calm demeanor and non-flashy appearance? Both men do what they should to be successful in their field, only while Crowe continuously gets punished for it in lifebut not career per seWashington just gets richer. Who should we strive to be then? Like the young man with a 95 mph fastball, who gives up his gravy train, says, 'I want to be like you Uncle Frank.' You don't see Robert's son looking up to dad, instead he seems to not even know he exists, pretty much because he doesn't to him.I don't want to slight the story though. This is a very intriguing premise, how a black man subverts the middleman, like local electronic stores, to buy his drugs from the source in Bangkok. This no name does what the Italians never could, sell superior product for half the price, and stay almost completely under the radar. Whether the expensive chinchilla coat from his wife truly was the cause of him appearing on enemy lists or notit is a bit convenientit was bound to happen sometime. Although, keeping a low profile and staying conservative is a novel idea that you'd think more criminals would want to adopt. The Frank Lucas story works, but I think it would truly succeed as its own tale. Just show us his life, or maybe just his heyday as a ruthless criminal, not as a kid from the streets that works hard and runs his city. Glorifying crime should not be what Hollywood wants to do.While the Lucas tale was good, the Roberts one was great. Now, the Richie Roberts Story is something I would definitely watch. Here is a guy that is married to his job and estranged from his wife and kid. Someone who finds a million dollars of drug money and doesn't take a penny; will not cover for his partner or friends if they do something illegal; and who will stop at nothing to actually put bad men behind bars. Even more unbelievable is how he not only takes down the most dangerous criminal in New York, but he also prosecutes him in court, getting him to cooperate in taking down corrupt cops. Then, the craziest revelation of all, he becomes Lucas' defense attorney and gets his term shortened by fifty years. It is too bad that rather than give two hour-and-a-half films on each guy separately, we get a bloated three hour parallel tale of the two at once. I only stayed invested in anticipation to finally see these two powerhouses on screen together.In that regard, Washington and Crowe deliver the goods like usual. Supporting them, however, is a big time cast of names. I can't believe all the people they got to be involved here with bit parts. Ejiofor, Hawkes, Brolin, Gugino, Common, Ortiz, Gooding Jr., Assante, and more vault the story to a higher level through their professionalism. Even RZA has a nice turn, but did we need the money shot of his tattooed name on his shoulder? Come on, cover that up, it was just stupid. I really hope John Ortiz will continue to get work because like in Miami Vice, he makes a small role his own.So, in the end, as with most biopics, this one just shows too much. It lulled me into a sense of cruise control, just watching and watching, waiting for something special to happen. There are moments, like the final shootout that works nicely and a good exchange at the end between Lucas and his mother, but they are few and very far between. Only in America can a man without conscience, a murderer and drug-lord, blow-in a few corrupt cops and skate out of jail time to once again roam the streets. I understand the utilitarianism of it all and that he might be a marked man now, but honestly, he turned in police officers not gang leaders. There won't be any hits put on his head; he'll be able to retire with no problem. Not to mention, I'm sure, that probably no ramifications were experienced by the military and their involvement in the smuggling of contraband into the country. It's like this all happened and we learned nothing from it.",6,4,6,18 November 2007
Stranger Than Fiction," Harold Crick and his wristwatchÂ…Stranger Than Fiction
","Marc Forster is one of those directors that over that past years have been on my film radar. After a strong debut, (I know he had a couple previous, but lets go with it), with Monster's Ball and a great follow-up of Finding Neverland, he really wowed me last year with the visual flair and emotion of Stay. This year sees the release of Stranger Than Fiction written by Zach Helm, whom people are hailing as one of the best new screenwriters, interesting since this is his first script made into a Hollywood feature. There were definite reservations on my part having the lead be cast to Will Ferrell, but I decided to go with my inclination to Forster movies and hope that we get Melinda and Melinda Ferrell, not watch me be an ass Ferrell. Thankfully Will gives possibly his greatest performance yet and really helps drive this intelligent, poignant allegory into a strong feature and a continuance to Forster's streak of winners.Many things could have gone wrong with Stranger Than Fiction. Ferrell could have pulled a Jim Carrey and highjacked the tale, it could have turned into slapstick comedy, or also could have become a Wonderful Life ripoff of sentimentality as all involved discovered an inner love and exuberance for doing good. Credit Helm and Forster for sticking to their guns and creating a true existential parable, showing how we are in control of our actions and we make choices in our lives either for worse or better. If you woke up tomorrow hearing a narration of your mundane activities, you have the ability to dismiss it as craziness, disregard it all together and except your fate, or wake up and decide to do something about it. Fate doesn't dictate your willingness to survive and that is exactly what Harold Crick wants to do. No matter how worthless his existence has been, all it takes is one wakeup call to turn it around and make something meaningful happen, to take a chance rather than cowardly take the easy way out.Yes the film has many laugh-out-loud moments, however, it is mostly a nuanced and subtle film. It takes itself very seriously and most of the laughs hit big because of the deadpan delivery and gravity of the situation at hand. These characters don't necessarily make light of the circumstances as much as go along with skepticism and a dash of possibility. Every instance is orchestrated to perfection and besides bringing up early on that a certain Wednesday event held the key to Crick's demise, days before our author even began to know how to go about killing him, complete without any real plot holes. Helm took his time with this tale of the meaning of life, (great reference to this by having Monty Python's movie of same name on screen briefly), and made every detail work throughout the evolution of a nobody into a literary hero.Besides Ferrell's revelation in acting ability, we are treated to numerous standout performances. The always wonderful Maggie Gyllenhaal shows how skilled she is in playing a bitter idealist while deftly balancing a budding interest in that she is against. Dustin Hoffman does spot-on work as an eccentric literary historian trying to help Crick, more out of educational curiosity than human compassion; a nice companion to his performance in the other recent great existential tale I Heart Huckabees. Emma Thompson steals the show, however, with her broken reclusive writer, so enthralled in finding ways to kill her characters she can't have a real connection with that of living people. The need she has to correspond with Hoffman's character, but her inability to do so as it might cloud her ability to write profound dark tales, is portrayed beautifully. Every emotion she goes through during her discovery about the novel is great to watch.Every minute of Stranger Than Fiction is measured and calculated to the utmost degree. Much like the film's fetish for numbers, (I loved the computer grids and diagrams superimposed throughout), Helm's script is a formula being solved. Every equation has one answer to even out both sides and while this film is no different, the filmmakers took a bit of liberty with its ultimate conclusion. The way it was going was perfect, the characters reactions to what was about to happen magnificent, and then the story took one last turn. While at first unfortunate, the final twist of the tale was redeemed by a profound statement from Thompson's Karen Eiffel, so true to form and relevant to the proceedings that I agree with her: I'm OK with just good. Just because the answer wasn't quite correct doesn't mean they can't get partial credit for the great work they did in the process.",9,0,1,18 November 2006
The Reader," Only one thing can make a soul completeand that one thing is love  The Reader
","What is guilt? I believe this is the central question behind Stephen Daldry's new film The Reader. Based on the novel by Bernhard Schlink, the story asks its audience what a true monster is. If you know a secret, one that could exonerate someone from being found guilty of murder, should you help her even though you know she's accepted her guilt despite being unable to stop it? What if that person was someone you loved? There is some heavy material thrown about in the second half of this film, emotions run high and people must make decisions concerning some very dire situations. One thing is for sure, though, once that decision is made, no matter which side of the fence you fall on, some shred of guilt, some feeling of remorse, is inevitably going to follow you around for the rest of your life. This is what we call being human, because as Bruno Ganz's Professor Rohl says, 'our justice is governed by laws, not morals.' It doesn't matter whether something was right or wrong, it's whether it was legal or illegal. Unfortunately our souls don't work that way.As said, these moral quandaries crop up in the brilliantly paced and constructed second half of the film. The power involved in the characters' actions all weigh heavy on those they touch. Perhaps the weight would not feel as palpable without the events of the first act, but either way, that portion of the film is too light and innocuous. We learn about young Michael Berg's, (a wonderful turn by David Kross, who is the true star of the film), affair with an older woman named Hanna Schmitz. This woman is very troubled and in a state of constant flux where her emotions are concerned. She loves Berg, but can never quite allow herself to fully commit to that feeling, her past continuously nagging at the back of her head, remembering what it was she used to do with those who read to her. Kate Winslet's performance as Hanna is quite good, but like the film itself, doesn't come into its own until the second act, when all the secrets finally become uncovered.It is a good beginning, the unabashed love of a young 15 year old and his first sexual partner. He becomes her orator of stories and partner in romance, but they both know it could never last. School would be commencing and Berg would see the young girls his age, ever comparing them to Hanna, and her manifesting his feelings with her own jealousy, knowing that she must let him go  this time sending herself away rather than those she 'befriended' of her past, those she sent off to whatever fate awaited them. Whether this violation became so deeply rooted in the boy, I'm not sure, but when he goes off to law school and crosses paths with his first love again, this time as she awaits charges of Nazi war crimes, he is torn on what is morally correct. It becomes his obligation to let the truth come out, despite the activities she partook in during the Holocaust. According to the law, he must divulge the information for justice, but his moral compass may not be able to do so.The story truly is wonderfully acted and directed, pulling at the audience's emotions and engaging them throughout. However, while the second half is the most intriguing and resonant, it also contains the one activity that I found abhorrent. Now older, Michael Berg is played by Ralph Fiennes, a lawyer, recently divorced and with a daughter. His journey back home, to his mother that has all but given up on him as a distant figure unable to open up to those that love him, becomes one of returning memories. Discovering the books he once read to Hanna almost two decades earlier, the guilt of what he didn't do makes him set upon a mission to right that wrong. But the way in which he does so is really quite wrong to me. He seems to condemn her for what she did still and only creates cassettes of stories to send her to assuage his own selfish need for forgiveness. He never appears to care about her, because if he did, he would have made different choices in that courtroom years before. Berg shows the selfishness that followed him the entire story and really got me thinking that maybe he was a worse human being than Hanna. It's an interesting dynamic to be sure, one that subverts the somewhat 'touching' conclusion the filmmakers seem to want to attempt.The Reader is an interesting look at German guilt and the people's need to place blame on others for the Holocaust in order to somehow absolve their own indifference of doing nothing when they themselves knew what was going on. One of Berg's classmates gets the whole issue correct in a little tirade about the absurdity of the trial. Here they all were, guilty themselves of knowing what went on in the thousands of camps, yet putting on trial only six women because a survivor, (interesting to see Lena Olin play a mother and daughterthe beauty of a film spanning decades), wrote a book fingering them. Just as Germany needed to place blame, so did Michael Berg. Rather than put it on his own shoulders though, like Hanna eventually selflessly does, he decides to side with the masses, sitting back silently and then trying in earnest to deal with his eventual guilt, not to apologize to the person he let down, but to somehow forgive himself. It is quite the despicable act and I'm not sure if that was the filmmakers' intent, however, that is the lasting impression it left on me.",7,16,16,24 January 2009
The Wrestler," TIFF 08: Sacrificial ramThe Wrestler
","It's a fascinating thought I had going into Darren Aronofsky's The Wrestler, screened at the Toronto International Film Festival. I began to worry that a straightforward tale may not be playing to the director's strengths. It wasn't until the end credits that I recalled Requiem For a Dream being an adaptation and his debut π being pretty grounded in reality despite its surrealistic tendencies. So in actuality, the guy had only made one non-straightforward film, and all to immense success, at least in my eyes. So, as of now, the guy is four for four. Not only does Mickey Rourke own the screen every second of the movie, but Aronofsky lends just the right amount of his stamp on the proceedings, creating a definite top ten inclusion for my end of year list and, by far, the best film I had seen at the festival.The story deals with an aging professional wrestler, a man that was a champion and idol in his heyday. Beaten and battered, Randy 'The Ram' Robinson finds himself doing small venues on the weekends, trying to relive past glory and entertain the fans still out there, while working at a grocery store during the week. Not having stopped with the working out, he also continues to take any drugs necessary to keep his physique as well as numb the pain of what ails him. Money is tight, the camps' landlord locks him out of his trailer; family is non-existent, his daughter wants nothing to do with him; and the only real human interaction he has is from a stripper (Marisa Tomei's Cassidy) he pays more for an ear to talk than for the lapdances. The Ram remembers the pastan old action figure of himself stands on his van's dashand does his best to keep it in the front of his mind. A wonderful example comes when he yells out his trailer to a neighborhood kid; asking if wants to play Nintendo. The two play a boxing game, Robinson of course as himself, while the boy talks about the new Call of Duty game coming out on Playstations, et al. This gap in culture and reality never hits him hard, though, as he loves the decade that built him too much.It is a heart attack that finally wakes Rourke's character from his long slumber of indifference and living without consequence. With a masterstroke of subtlety, Aronofsky begins to show his hand at this point. We begin to look around the locales The Ram visits. An autograph session is one example, rather than like the beginning, watching two enthusiastic fans get his signature and talk to each other about how nice a guy he is, we now watch a pan across the room at those selling their John Hancocks. Some of the wrestlers are older than he, and others not, however, they all have one thing in commona slow dismantling of their bodies from the hard, fast lifestyle they lived. We see canes, wheelchairs, sorrow, and pain etched in every face. The Ram finally realizes the risk he takes each time he steps in that ring and decides to retool his life for the future by attempting to rekindle a relationship with his daughter, a nice performance from Evan Rachel Wood; maybe start one with Cassidy, for real, not at the club; and take an invested interest at making a career out of the grocery store gig. It all helps establish a feeling that it could all be working out for him.The story is not that simple, though. What really hit home for me was the absolute frankness and unsentimental tone The Wrestler truly portrays. A great line comes with Rourke in the ring, about to fight, despite someone telling him he doesn't have to get hurt; he can stop. The Ram just looks back and says, 'I only get hurt out there,' pointing to the outside world. That ring is his safe haven, the one place he is loved unconditionally by fans and peers alike, the ropes serving as walls against the prejudices, looks, and pain awaiting him out in the real world. He is a wrestler to the bone, expressed earlier with a viciously orchestrated battle involving tables, staple guns, and barbed wire. The entire film is really just a slice of life following The Ram around as he figures out the path that works for him. Sometimes the costume is the real personjust ask Supermanand to go back to being Robin Randinski becomes too much to handle.It's a performance worthy of award and a tale succeeding on all counts. Aronofsky is not shy to work some magic, nor afraid to let the story take control when necessary. All the glamour and celebrity is there along with the flip side of the coin when gravity kicks in. An amazing experience to be sure, you won't want to get up at its conclusion, (the wonderful new Bruce Springsteen song definitely helps this fact), instead staying to contemplate what has happened and what might happen, as the filmmakers throw a question mark at you. Whether Randy 'The Ram' Robinson is content, we will never know, but one thing we do is that he lived without regret. It may not have all turned out the way he wanted, but in the end he a man that will not, that cannot, change. And he doesn't have to.",10,19,30,17 September 2008
Hancock," Tonight, He ComesHancock
","Hancock has the kind of premise that you wonder why it took so long for someone to put it on the big screen. With the plethora of comic book movies coming to cinemas this decade, it was only a matter of time before we were given a tale of a washed up superhero, drunk and lonely, being berated for his destruction rather than praised for his bravery. Alan Moore delved into this realm with his graphic novel Watchmen, (for which it seems Zach Snyder has not massacred turning it into a film itself), and Pixar's The Incredibles touched a bit on the subject with the disbanding of heroes by the government, however, here is something different. This guy doesn't hide his identity or pretend he is something he's not. No, he lets it all out on the line and most of it is unflattering and just plain rude. Jaded from the lack of respect he receives, John Hancock finds that he'd rather wallow away in solitude than try and make people like him. Sure he will still go out and help where he can, while making 9 billion dollars worth of damage, but when he's done, it's back to the bar and the bottle, his only friends in the world.All that changes with a chance meeting of a down-on-his-luck public relations man. Caught a second from death as a train barrels down on his car, Hancock swoops in and saves his life, while harming many others in the process. Seeing an opportunity to get back into the big leagues, Ray Embrey decides to make his hero his new client. By having this freak of nature turn himself into authorities for the warrant out for his arrest due to the multiple fines and disturbing the peace charges, Ray thinks that a little time away from the city will show the people how much they need him. While incarcerated, crime goes up 30% in just five days, people start to worry as the criminals begin to feel invincible, and, to top it all off, Hancock gets a little quiet time to himself so that he can rework his image. Dealing with anger issues and alcoholism on the inside, Ray also begins to work on his personality, turning him into a civil person, or at least as close as he can get, (when you see Hancock's smile for the camera, you'll understand what I mean). Once the city comes a calling, his rebirth will allow him to be ready to take control as someone the public can trust, rather than hate.Ripe for comedy, the fact that Ray is played by the immensely talented Jason Bateman and Hancock by Will Smith, the film delivers on the funny. I always assume when Bateman gets on a roll that a lot is improvised, and once again I wouldn't be surprised if that's the case here. The two build a fantastic rapport and the sarcastic wit flies back and forth. What is refreshing amidst this comic bent we expect is how good Smith is as the jerk. This guy has made a name for himself as the blockbuster hero, modest and heroic to a fault, never showing a selfish bone in his body. Here, however, he is egotistical, self-absorbed, and downright mean. It's like how I felt watching Russell Crowe chew the scenery in 3:10 to Yuma, watching a great actor play against type is like discovering them all over again. Smith is one of the best out there and he doesn't disappoint.As a whole, it really is just about these two guys, becoming business partners and friends as they ride the waves to success. I don't want to leave the rest of the cast behind, though, and must make mention of Charlize Theron. After reading an early synopsis, when the film was still titled Tonight, He Comes, I had her character pegged into a certain place. I was completely wrong and surprised to see where her role goes as she plays a very crucial part to the story. I will admit to never really getting all the hype around her, (no I have not seen Monster yet, it'll happen eventually), but she is very solid here as usual, I don't dislike her, I just don't see the unending praise. Also, like every Peter Berg film of late, this thing is chock full of cameos, (you'll even see the director himself, hearkening back to his 'Chicago Hope' days in a split second scene). I mean, when you get director pal Michael Mann and writer Akiva Goldsman to poke fun at themselves in a board meeting, you know this guy enjoys what he does and invites his friends along for the ride.Despite all that works for it, the film doesn't quite do its premise service. If the writers would have stuck to the comedy element and continued on that path, I think the story would have benefited. Instead, Hancock attempts to be bigger then it is. Without any real villain to root against, (the only bad guy is actually Hancock himself as he tries to turn his life around), there isn't really anything to create a worthwhile climax with weight. Instead we are shown a chance coincidence and how the stakes of that event hold the lives of two of our leads in the balance. The situation wants to be dramatichence the slow-mo visualsbut ultimately becomes a bit out of place if not obvious. It all works OK, though, mostly because the film itself is very slight and devoid of true plot. The evolution of Hancock is a rapid one and at barely an hour and a half, there's not much room for more depth. The laughs are big, however, and the film entertaining, so as a popcorn summer tent-pole, Smith will most definitely deliver some big numbers, even though he's going against that cute little Pixar robot.",6,10,23,26 June 2008
Shooter," I'm gonna see it throughShooter
","Director Antoine Fuqua has a style and filmography that I have enjoyed in the past. With Training Day and King Arthur, he delivered some action packed movies that had both story and popcorn pyrotechnics. I will say that after seeing the trailer for his new film Shooter, I was a bit underwhelmed, but until I went to one of his works and was not entertained, I would at least give it a shot. I'm glad I did as Shooter ended up being a well told, nicely paced actioner that knew what it wanted to do at all times and lived up to its goals. We are never led into a situation that may twist in a way that will bring us out of the reality of what is happening; our hero has been framed and he will do anything necessary to find justice. Fuqua tells us who the good guys and who the bad guys are at all times. There is never an opportunity for the audience to second guess someone's motives because the filmmaker is willing to appreciate our intelligence and spin a linear tale of revenge, trying to set things right against a corrupt government.A big part of the film's success lies in the performance by Mark Wahlberg. I have never been a real fan of his acting prowess, but I must give him credit for getting better each time he is in front of the camera. In my opinion, he was horrible early on in his career in movies like Fear. Sure he had a great turn in Boogie Nights, but I hold that true because he was basically playing himselfa young man new to the entertainment industry, trying to understand his role in it all. Only when he came out with possibly the best role in the phenomenal movie I Heart Huckabees did I finally say to myself, 'this guy may be able to do the job after all.' Wahlberg is wonderful as Bob Lee Swagger on his journey to find out who is behind the conspiracy that led to his being framed in a Presidential assassination plot. The role may not be very demanding as far as range goes, but that is OK, because he does all he is asked and is believable as the ex-army sniper. All the weaponry jargon that spews from his mouth may sound like gibberish, but he sells it that he knows what he's talking about.The supporting cast help prop up the film as well, allowing for some nice sequences. Michael Peña is great as the FBI agent who sees that something isn't right and becomes willing to help uncover what truly happened the night of the shooting. Ned Beatty has a nice turn as a corrupt Senator, and although I kept waiting for him to mumble 'yes sir, Mr. Luthor,' he did a nice job. Also, mention must be made for the fantastic Elias Koteas. When he is given a role that he can really run with he takes it over and is electric. He plays the villain perfectly and between the slimeball moves and the hilarious scene at the end, (I love that he takes his belt off in the background while on the ground trying to make a tourniquetmost actors would probably just squirm there after what happens, but even when not the focal point he tries to bring the role out), you got to love the guy.Besides the competent acting and some nice camera-work, (when Wahlberg enters what he knows is a trap, the camera composes each view of him in a way to show a vast space behind, making you think that someone will be turning up to take him out; the framing makes the suspense rise even higher), there are some problems. Sure the story is a convenient one, smart enough to get where it wants to go, taking the usual liberties action- flicks of this kind take, but it is effective and straight-forward. I don't mind this shortcoming because it is better than trying to be more than you are, ruining any credibility you might have had. What I do mind is bad acting. Upon viewing the trailer I thought I would be pulling my hair out listening to Kate Mara's fake hick accent, however, she wasn't that bad. The atrocity actually came from Danny Glover. Whether it was his decision or the director's, I don't know, but his mouthpiece-causing lisp was terrible. At first I was wondering if he got that old he was wearing dentures and they were falling out, but when looking closer you can see a clear mouthpiece on his bottom row of teeth causing a bad speech pattern. I cringed each time he opened his mouth.At the end of the day though, Fuqua delivers the action and his actors do the job at pulling it all off. Shooter is by no means a masterpiece, but who actually goes to these types of movies expecting one? If you have two hours to spare and want to be entertained with a minimal amount of brainwork to pull you through, I can think of many worse things to do instead of checking out Wahlberg's one-man fight against the tyranny of influential people in high places.",6,14,29,9 April 2007
Defiance," We should have killed the milkman  Defiance
","With Edward Zwick's newest wartime epicthe man is a pro at them ever since Glorytitled Defiance we get the unthinkable. Here is a ragtag group of Belarusian Jews running for their lives and hiding in the forest; pulled together into a community of survival by three brothers with the name Bielski. Say what you will about the Americans or the Brits or any other trained army that came in to fight against the tyranny and brutality of Hitler and his SS, these men and women, these intellectuals and poor working class people are true heroes. Looking at the person next to them, knowing it was they whom they fought for, these escapees of the slaughtered masses decided to stand up against evil, to take their lives in their own hands. The Bielskis had no formal training other than the will to not become animals like the Germans so desperately tried to make them. They fought for humanity and made their own survival each day their revenge.We are thrust into the story right from the get-go. Zus and Asael Bielski are out when they hear the SS on their capturing/murdering assignment. Rushing home, they soon discover the dead bodies of their father and neighbors. Inside their barn, hidden under wooden slats, lies their youngest brother Aron, shaken and muted from the atrocities he had witnessed, but he is alive and the brothers are thankful for that. The three go into the woods, a terrain they know well, a forest refuge the Germans know nothing about, and are stumbled upon the next day by eldest sibling Tuvia. It soon becomes a mission of survival, of finding food and weapons to stay safe and to protect the numerous refugees that eventually come their way. Tuvia knows that there is not enough food for everyone, but he can't turn his back on his own people, to send them to the ghettos for what was inevitably death. However, he and second oldest Zus soon take different sides on how to save their lives. Both men have a bloodlust for revengeretribution for what happened to their family, but also for what has happened to their peopleyet while one reconciles those feelings into survival, the other wants aggressive intervention, to fight on the front lines with the Russians and take out as many Germans as he can.This dynamic helps to add another layer to the tale besides just a Jewish versus Nazi opposition. Although they are on the same side, Daniel Craig's Tuvia is a realist knowing that revenge won't bring any of the dead back. He is too preoccupied with keeping the hundreds now under his care safe and alive and hidden from the enemy. Liev Schreiber's Zus, on-the-other-hand, cannot forget his need to destroy those men that destroyed his life. Some say that he cannot turn into them, he can't become a monster, but he may be correct in countering with the statement that he won't, yet that doesn't mean he can't kill like them. A father, a wife, a child  all taken from him by the Germans; you can't help but understand his point of view and want him to get whatever retribution he can. Because honestly, every German he kills means one less that can hurt the people his brother is now trying to protect.When there aren't Germans to fight there are greedy members of their own camp to put down. At one point Tuvia falls ill for a spell and it appears as though his power and platform of equality is in jeopardy. A hungry soldier attempts a coup, twice, and takes the usually understanding Bielski brother to his breaking point. Asael told him the first time that Zus would have stopped the dissenter without hesitation. It may take Tuvia longer to reach that mindset, throwing forgiveness out the window, but he is not afraid to. Along with this strife in the Otriad camp comes the anti-Semitism in the Russian Partisan camp, men fighting alongside one another, Zus being their strongest fighter, yet the Jews still get beaten up when using a Russian's latrine. Zus joined them to fight for their cause, for his cause, but even amongst allies he cannot escape the bigotry and racism that has brought their continent into such turmoil.Zwick knows how to shoot true stories in a way to capture interest. While he may not be flashy or stylish, he composes some solid films that help teach a little lesser-known history while also telling a story worth watching. There are a couple moments of beauty; a nicely edited sequence in the fluttering snow, juxtaposing Asael's wedding with an ambush by the Partisans for instance, (ruined only slightly by the heavy-handed score), but for the most part everything is shot in an economy of plot, showing what is necessary to continue the tale to its conclusion. The real strength here is in the casting. Many roles are inspired choices indeed. Jamie Bell goes through a transformation from scared and sad boy who's life is turned upside-down to a man fit to lead an army, one that can inspire even his older brother, a man who has been leading them all since the beginning. And as for Craig and Schreiber, it is a total mismatch of the usual roles they get. Whereas Craig generally plays the Bond-types, unsentimental killers with a stone face, Schreiber is most known for his intellectual, even-keeled characters. With Defiance, though, they defy those types and play what any other director would have had the other do. It is an interesting choice that definitely pays off, for both shine here and carry the film successfully on their shoulders.",8,4,11,3 January 2009
WALL·E," Define dancingWall-E
","Robots falling in love. There is a lot to like about the new Pixar film Wall-E. The animation goes without sayingbetter than anything out there. The glares, the environments, everything is rendered spectacularly, right down to the flame of a Zippo lighter. As for the story, leave it to these wizards for creating a tale that hits on a gut level, letting our simplest emotions come to the surface in order speak to our hearts and souls. With fewer words than Arnold Swartzenegger had to speak in Terminator 2, this movie relies on its visuals and on the movements and actions of the characters. It is appropriate that we are shown clips from older musicals to show humanity before Earth was abandoned. If we harken back to them for the joys of people, why not go to silent era style in order to portray communication between beings that cannot speak? Wall-E, his crush EVE, and all the other robots involved can say little than their name, however, we understand exactly what they mean throughout. The entire film speaks on a level that most people might have forgotten. In an age of Hollywood spoon-feeding the masses by having actors preach the obvious, Pixar has shown their originality again by getting an audience to partake in a film that makes them pay attention and work a little; something that the message of the piece is trying to have come across for humanity in general.I credit the filmmakers for showcasing a world that has been left unlivable due to pollution and excess, yet never stooping to the level of liberal propaganda to soapbox an environmental agenda. No, the idea of 'going green' or 'stop global warming' never comes out blatantly, but instead we are shown the message of how technology is making us gluttons and sloths, reliant for everything and unable to even see what is going on right in front of our faces. Humanity, drifting on a space station for 700 years being waited on hand and foot, has become a giant mass of inactive waste. Watching their awakening at the hands of a little waste removal machine, seeing love, life, and beauty as if for the first time ever is a wonderful thing. Sure the homage to 2001: A Space Odyssey is fantastic, but these moments work on another level altogetherthat of truth. Consumer culture and materialism has destroyed our society to the point that social status depends on the car you drive and the trinkets you can collect rather than the job you do and the work you put in. To see the Captain of the vessel, housing what has become of the human race, slowly open his eyes to what could be is mind-blowingly simple, yet also so necessary for children these days to see what burying their heads in the computer and cell phone is doing to the societal structure of the world. We need to stop being lemmings, droning along without purpose. There is a reason for life, things to strive for and love is one of them, something very prevalent here.The robots themselves become more human than the humans, showing the emotion and compassion that people have left by the wayside. Curiosity takes center stage as Wall-E finds treasures amongst the trash he has been programmed to clean up for a return of life to Earth. Stacking his compacted boxes of refuse into skyscrapers taller than those left behind, he finds shelter in an abandoned tractor where he keeps spare parts and objects to play with during his solitude. Never expecting a visitor, or the impact that finding a small sapling of greenery could cause, a sophisticated robot named EVE arrives and changes his world forever. Not only does she become the woman of his dreams, but she also causes him to leave Earth and discover the spaceship, which has been trying to find his home for way too long.Maybe it is funny to say, but the chemistry between these two machines is quite palpable and real, as they discover feelings that they shouldn't have due to programming and such, but they have evolved into sentient creatures. They fight for freedom against the spaceship's auto-pilot and take a stand to end the tyranny that has been subtly and effectively beating the humans into submission. Of course they may not be doing it for the humans per se, there is a matter of needing to go back for spare parts, but you'll understand once you see. Sure the Captain does his part to see the hero that Wall-E becomes to his stagnant race and being voiced by the hilarious Jeff Garlin definitely helps. When he starts viewing the history of Earth and just exudes wonderment and joy, you really enjoy the ride as he attempts to reverse his sloth and actually stand on his two legs for possibly the first time ever.Where I do have a problem with the film is the pacing. Yes, I know there is very little dialogueand I whole-heartedly praise the film for itbut the beginning does have a tendency to drag. Maybe some of that has to do with it being an extended version of the trailer, but it just gets a little tedious as we wait for EVE to arrive and end the cute monotony of Wall-E playing with his finds in ways they aren't supposed to be used for, we've seen it before in The Little Mermaid. Even once they are on the ship, the cat and mouse game gets a little prolonged to pad the runtime a bit. The story here isn't very complex and I just wish there had been more to it, or at least a bit faster paced of a plot progression. Otherwise, though, this is another solid film from Pixar, showing that they definitely have the creativity and storytelling ability to infuse heart back into cinema and try new things rather than regurgitate for a big paycheck.",8,94,142,25 June 2008
The Good Shepherd," The rest of you are just visitingThe Good Shepherd
","The Good Shepherd tells the story of Edward Wilson and his ascent in the ranks of the CIA's Counter-Intelligence division. This stoic Yale graduate found himself at the cusp of war with an offer to help serve his country, and, as is shown throughout, the call of country and brotherhood will always supercede that of God and family. Wilson's life becomes so caught up in his job, which was necessary to keep his country thriving throughout World War II and the Cold War that all his personal attachments slowly deteriorate. Wilson loves his son, but only with his heart left over from loving the values his country gives him. A true utilitarian, he doesn't have the ability to side with a single person when the whole of America's fate lies in the balance. He is a man of strong convictions and controlled actions, and although it seems his life has destroyed that of those close to him, it was in fact his own life he destroyed so many years ago.I give De Niro much credit for delving into a subject as ambitious as the start of the CIA in just his second feature film. Not only is this subject matter complicated and shrouded in mystery, the structure of the script is one of shifting years and flashbacks. We begin in 1961 as the Bay of Pigs Invasion fails miserably because of a breach in intelligence. The duration of the film shows us how Edward Wilson has gotten to the point of being lead on a failed mission, and to solving the question of who turned their back on the country. Wilson is played magnificently by Matt Damon, his emotions always held close and, while etched in his features, always bottled inside. This nuanced performance truly encompasses the character's conflicted nature between serving himself and serving his nation. His evolution from an ambitious college student playing women's roles in plays to the hardened man able to see the enemy as a statistic is heartbreaking, especially as we see those few people who tried to save him from his path of eventually solitude.Being such a long film, spanning three decades of history, there are many supporting players coming in and out of view. Most do an admirable job in keeping appearances up by playing against Damon at multiple points in his life. Michael Gambon deserves notice as a man who worked in the business yet knew what it could do in destroying any chance of love in one's life. He knew how life would end if he didn't give his all to the job, but didn't care about the consequences when the alternative was turning himself off to life's pleasures and beauty. Angelina Jolie surprised me in her role as Damon's wife. Her emotional range was vast and she played it nuanced enough for the audience to be able to feel for her plight. However, while Jolie did well, her female counterpart Tammy Blanchard truly stole the show. I had never heard of her before checking into people's reactions about the film. Many said how good Blanchard was, and after seeing for myself, I can't do anything but agree. She is the true love of Damon's character, a beautiful romantic who's deafness never stood in the way of how they felt for each other. Her innocence is a metaphor for the film and Edward Wilson's journey through it. Once she was removed from his life, humanity was lost forever.While the story was wonderfully constructed and perfectly revealed its motives, it was not a perfect film. I don't pin its failures on any one person, however, but instead on its epic scale. Maybe De Niro is to blame for not using different actors in portraying Damon and Jolie's characters in younger years, but the aging process used was not believable. As shown in 1960, they are done up nicely, wrinkled and etched with the pain of a long fifty years of life. The real trouble is in the early scenes. While Damon probably could have passed as a college student in the 30's, the filmmakers decide to use his natural look for the 40's and try to make him look younger with a badly done hairdo for the college years. As for Jolie, they decide to use her natural look for the 30's and end up making it look like a 35 year old is hitting on a 20 year old. I also think, while Billy Crudup is great casting as an intelligence agent, he is a horrible selection as a British intelligence agent. The accent is horrid and one of the few blemishes acting wise here. My main criticism, though, is the length. Yes, the time flew by as I became enthralled in the story, but it still could have been tightened up. There are many scenes that could have been excised without losing any insight into the proceedings. The most blatant moment was the five-minute scene that brought the great Joe Pesci out of retirement. Besides the final line by Damon, (which could have been put somewhere else, as it was a great line), the whole scene appears to be there only to show Pesci off and does little to advance the plot.Besides these minor squabbles, The Good Shepherd is a remarkable film. Many speak badly about it as the action is not there, there is little espionage and spy genre aspects, etc. This film is not a spy film, but instead a human portrait of a man who slowly watching himself go down a path that his father went down. In living his life for his country he never allowed himself to live his life for himself. While America was able to flourish his own love for life was stunted and he could do nothing but watch everything good in it slowly fade into the past.",9,3,6,6 January 2007
The Queen," Will someone please save these people from themselvesThe Queen
","I generally don't find many biopics to be great cinema. Most times you get a bloated story spanning what feels like millennia with only a charismatic mimic to guide your way. Thankfully every once in a while you'll get a biopic with a real story, an arc that has substance and meaning no matter who was involved. One of these films was last year's Capote, a brilliant cast of actors and an enthralling story of murder, compassion, and misguided affection. Much in this style comes Stephen Frears' The Queen. With but a short week of time to tell, screenwriter Peter Morgan is able to show us a slice of life in the government of England and how they react to heavy turmoil. With the death of Princess Diana, we are shown how a country mourns its loss and how they force their monarch to change the values of a nation.What is truly fact or fiction, I really don't know. If I am to hold what occurs in this film as truth, which I will for the sake of reviewing said film, it is heartbreaking to watch Queen Elizabeth II fall out of favor with her constituents for only doing what she was meant to do. England is not a democracy; its royalty live by a code of conduct and lead their people with unflinching devotion to their prosperity. When these people decide to worship the memory of a woman who left the family, threw back at them what was given to her, and instead used her celebrity to make a name for herself, they expect all to feel their grief. The Queen feels devastation in what happened to the mother of her grandchildren, and being that she no longer was a member of the royal family, allowed the departed's kin to set the rules. Diana's family wanted a private burial away from the media scruntity that all but murdered her. The Queen does everything she can to keep the wishes of those intimately involved in tact. Unfortunately the people have spoken and all must do their beckoning. It's as if England had become a democracy overnight, telling their elected official what she should be doing, canonizing the deceased while stringing up their leader. In order to save face, Elizabeth must bend to the people and give them what it is they want against all she has ever been taught. She must become a puppet for these men and women who have lost their dignity and instead turned to idol worship and celebrity stardom. The media made Diana who she was, killed her, and then nearly brought down the country as a result. Elizabeth didn't even bow down to a majority rule; no the democracy that formed around her was only at 25% for the dissolving of the monarchy. Credit Tony Blair for seeing the trouble happening and realizing his duty to the crown to try and get the Queen to acquiesce to the people's demands, no matter how unnecessary that action should have been.Helen Mirren and Michael Sheen are astonishing in their roles as Queen and Tony Blair respectively. They encompass their characters fully and show the inner struggle they each must deal with in order to come out of the media frenzy alive. While the Queen knows her place and did what she felt was called upon in her position, Blair knew the changing times and through utter respect for his Queen, while his coworkers wanted it out of contempt, tried his best to find a middle ground. The two great moments in this film come when Mirren first begins to crack emotionally and when Blair finally shows his respect for what his leader is doing. The reaction upon being asked to help the people grieve by Mirren is brilliant. Her finally saying that see has a grieving family to take care of first and foremost showed her motherly instincts and the fact that Diana was a person and not a figure or photo in a magazine worshipped by the masses. As for Sheen's shining moment, when his people begin berating the Queen for giving a speech to the people but not believing a word she is saying of it, he finally snaps and says that is why she is so great a leader. She was willing to go against herself in order to save the crippling effect her supposed mistakes had on the nation. Being able to put her job aside for a moment, a job she was raised to believe was given to her by God, showed real courage and strength. To express that humility must have taken a lot out of her, but she made the sacrifice.It is a real difficulty to side with the people of Britain when, during the many cut scenes of real footage, we see thousands of camera flashes amongst those crying. Yes people felt sad about the death, but unfortunately many people were just there for the spectacle, for bragging rights of saying they were there. How could they have the gaul to make The Queen put the flag standard at half mast above the palace when it wouldn't happen even if she herself died. I credit Frears for making both the Queen and Blair at opposition yet at each other's side. There is great impartiality shown here and those who view it can take what they will. To me it opened my eyes to the fact that the people of Britain made the monarchy change what it stood for because of a woman who was not a member of it. Unfortunately humanity has come to the point where a celebrity means more than those that are in power to lead and protect us. I'm sure just allowing me the opportunity to make a judgment on the proceedings, to see all sides of the incident, is all the filmmakers could have wished for. I applaud their success.",8,0,1,28 November 2006
1408," Let's 'Encyclopedia Brown' this1408
","It seems that the best Stephen King films are culled from his short stories (Shawshank Redemption and Stand By Me among them). However, those also tend to be the dramatic films with little supernatural scares. So, I wasn't quite sure what to expect from the new film 1408. It is a short story, so it would hopefully be concise and to the point, but it was also a thriller/horror which never quite make the jump from book to screen successfully. What works in words at creating imagery in your head doesn't pack the same punch when someone else shows you what it looks like to them. The film has been garnering good buzz though, and I'm a John Cusack apologist; the man can still be loved even in the drivel he associates with lately. So, the question becomes, was the film a successful thriller that keeps you on the edge of your seat throughout? My answer here is actually yes, but with numerous reservations. There was a lot to like with this movie, but unfortunately there was just as much to shake your head at.The real winner in all of this is Cusack. He gives a fantastic performance while being the center of attention throughout the entire duration. He must get through many emotions as we slowly find out the motives that led him to being a cynical occult writer, estranged from his wife. His story is a tragic one and Cusack delivers on the repressed anger and sadness he has tried to keep buried inside. Once he enters room 1408, however, all those feelings are used against him and brought to the surface, creating the most horrific hour of his life. Horrific in the psychological sense; he deals with his own demons in the film, not ghoulies and monsters. The way in which director Mikael Håfström deals with these manifestations of Cusack's soul is very effective.As far as the progression of what was happening to him in that hotel room, I couldn't have been more pleased. The set pieces were creative and the climate changes that transformed the room with every increase in the scale of terror were effective. Sure the jump scares were tried and true, (a crazed person with a knife that popped up every once in a while, the high tension of walking a building's ledgeCat's Eye anyone?and the dead man trapped in the ventilation system), but they were also paced right and less boring than just common. All the effects were good, the TV-like holograms of the dead walking around the room was handled well if also the norm in all horror films these days, and the room's destruction seemed real rather than computer-generated. I wouldn't be surprised if they actually destroyed the set rather than dressed it up to look that way.Where the film really fails is in the supporting characters and the misstep that occurs towards the end. For a movie that works when it is just Cusack in a hotel room, we are given too many outsiders and too many scenes outside of the room. Not to ruin anything, but there is a moment when our lead exits the hotel towards the conclusion of the film. This ends up derailing any suspense that had been building for me. Not only does it kill the claustrophobia that was settling in, but it kills the pacing and makes you think they are going in a specific direction which I just keep saying to myself, 'I really hope they don't do what I think,' instead of watching to see how it plays out. The use of twists these days is so common that when utilized correctly or not, the audience finds themselves thinking about the structure of the trick rather than letting it happen to them.As far as the supporting roles, I'm not saying they were poorly acted, they were poorly written and fleshed out. Besides Mary McCormack as Cusack's estranged wife, all the roles were made to seem more important than they are. The real failure, to me, is the Gerald Olin role, played by Sam Jackson. What begins as a setup character, someone to give us the hotel's history and create mood becomes something else completely by the end. If Jackson never came back on screen after Cusack goes into the room, I would have been happy. He soon becomes our lead's default person to blame for the crazy events happening, and that is OK. What isn't is that as the film goes on, we start to see Jackson some more, almost like he is really orchestrating it all. The truth is though, that it makes no sense because all that is happening is inside Cusack's head. It is the final scene with Jackson that put me over the top on hating his role. The moment takes place outside of the room and therefore is real, but it is so cryptic and unnecessary that it just makes you subvert all you were thinking for absolutely no payoff whatsoever.So, overall, the mood and atmosphere were effective, Cusack was amazing throughout, and the way the psychological horrors play out, right to the end scene with his tape recorder, is spot-on. Unfortunately, the actual scares were generic and the writing of the supporting roles weak. While it is definitely not a total loss, I wouldn't recommend seeing it in the theatres. A rental or TV-sitting is all that's needed here.",5,1,2,30 June 2007
The Iron Giant," Duck and coverThe Iron Giant
","I finally took the time to see writer/director Brad Bird's first foray into feature length film with The Iron Giant. Hearing how great of a film it was and the success of his Pixar debut The Incredibles, I've been seeing the movie on my shelf for a while now, just waiting to finally be viewed. If you thought his last movie had heart, you need to see this one. While being based on a book, I'm not sure if it is the original source material or Bird's vision on screen, but the parallels to King Kong are unmistakable. This creature from another world instills fear into all but one personone person who can see beneath the harsh exterior into the wealth of feelings and compassion bottled up within. Sure the beauty in a story like King Kong is the sacrifice he makes in order to keep his love safe at the unfortunate price of being a monster in the eyes of everyone else, but here we have a kid's story where happy endings aren't just a commonality but a necessity. Bird handles the subject matter nicely at the end in order to give the audience the same emotional attachment to the creature despite the fact that the general population does end up seeing him for what he truly is. Ala Superman/Spider-Man/ etc, the monster mystic soon dissolves as they begin saving human lives.A big part of The Iron Giant's success is the gorgeous animation. This may be one of the last great 2D animated films before CGI took over the field. The cinematic touches are great, including a depth of field composed of blurred images to give the audience a focal point. You forgive that the blurring effect renders the object even flatter than the medium does originally because the effect works as it would in a live-action film. Also, the lighting effects are wonderful, especially the flashlight sequences. When our young protagonist looks out his window into the woods, and the light flare goes from bright blind spot to illuminating band of vision, it looks very realistic. The power of the light even dissipates as the flash goes farther out into the distance. As with The Incredibles, though, the true heart of the film is in the fully fleshed out characters. There is not an overabundance of cluttered supporting roles, but instead a few main roles, which are allowed to evolve and grow an attachment from the viewers. The emotion etched into the movement and facial ticks of the Giant are spectacular at getting language across, much as would have been done in a silent film. Eli Marienthal does a great job as young Hogarth Hughes, the only one who believes that his new friend is more than a weapon. Christopher McDonald adds some nice comic relief as our only villainous role, albeit not a bad guy in the common use of the term, and Jennifer Aniston allows Mrs. Hughes to be both motherly and understanding of her son's adventures. The vocal star ends up being Harry Connick Jr., who is fantastic as Hogarth's friend and confidant when it comes to the new discovery of the Giant. I think the best compliment that a film like this can have is the fact that the vocal talent was so good I didn't recognize any as the people they are in real life. No one tried to infuse their own shtick into the part, but instead played the roles to enhance the story being told.Along with all that, we are treated to subtle commentary on the state of the government, both with the 'duck and cover' absurdity of atomic warfare and the references to gun control and war. These jabs are just that though, small moments that go along with the story, rather than take it over and hijack the film like what happened with Happy Feet this year. Weighty issues can be addressed in children films successfully, making the audience understand the problem yet not shoving it down their throats when the real issue at hand is the relationship between a child and his new otherworldly friend, giving him the confidence to stand up for himself and be a hero.So far Bird has really impressed me as an animation director. While the teaser for Pixar's new Ratatouille left me a bit indifferent, just the attachment of this autuer's name makes me that much more excited for the movie. Hopefully Bird can keep the track record intact and also, maybe prove that in order for these films to be successful, a good story is necessary. In an age where we get around ten animated films a year, there are many that are horrible cashcows to rip off unsuspecting parents into taking the children to a cartoon. Thankfully Brad Bird shows us that animated films can still hold up against live action ones for the pieces of art they should aspire to be.",8,4,6,4 March 2007
Iron Man," Don't waste itIron Man
","There was a big question mark looming over the theatrical adaptation of Marvel's Iron Man property. It was in the guise of director Jon Favreau. Now, don't get me wrong, I love the Favs, but when I heard he was helming a big budget comic book flicklet's just say I was a little worried. Once his cast was set and the fanboys started humming across the internet I started to ease into the decision with high anticipation. Thankfully, after finally seeing the finished product, I was not disappointed in the least. With a great mix of the professionalism and stakes seen in both Spider-Man and X-Men and the comic wit and sheer fun of Fantastic Four, Iron Man shows how a comic can be brought to the screen successfully without all the added drama and weight. We finally have a film with the essence of what makes these picture books so popular, the action and mythology along with a sense of adventure and humor. Favreau never bogs us down with overwrought emotions nor speaks down to us with gags and poorly written jokes. Instead he delivers on his promises and gives us a solid initiation into what could be a great trilogy or more.Favreau seems to have had an idea to get an origin story out while not boring us with long drawn out backstory. His ability to give us dual information at once is nicely orchestrated, showing Tony Stark in his basement creating while the TV in the background explains what is happening in the outside world of the Middle East and inside his own company. We as an audience are allowed to put the pieces together amidst the witty banter of Stark and the wonderful special effects. By the end of the film it is quite amazing how much information you will realize you now know, all culminating in a decent final battle, but more importantly a segue into the inevitable sequel. We are allowed entrance into the character evolution of Stark as he goes from war profiteer to man of action and cause, all while seeing the technology improve and advance before our eyes. Much like Batman, we have a hero here that needs help in fighting crime. He has no superhuman abilities besides his brain and being able to see his thoughts go from paper to reality is a feat of magic. Every stage is shown, every failure and success. It's quite the ride in and of itself, but when you add onto it the threat of global war and destruction, it can only get better.The real success here is in the bold move of casting an actor over-40 to be a superhero. This takes guts, because no matter how appropriate it is, most studios would have said, 'no, change the story and make him younger so we can churn out as many of these babies as we can.' I don't know how he did it, but Favreau got Marvel to get Robert Downey Jr. to play Stark, a sarcastic lothario with the brain capacity of Einstein. I truly can't think of anyone better suited to the role and he proves it by nailing every single scene. I'm sure there was some ad-libbing, but even if not, his comic delivery and ability to switch on a dime to a sincere seriousness at will shows his masterful craft.As for the rest of the cast, they all do well. Jeff Bridges plays the bombastic creature of villainy over-the-top, but appropriately so; Terrence Howard is nice as the friend and military liason, not given much to do, but definitely sowing seeds for the future; and Gwyneth Paltrow is good as the sweet assistant Pepper Potts who at times seems a little underwritten and more female prop than anything else, but comes through with some nice moments in a very comic sort of way. I also really liked Shaun Toub as Yinsen, Stark's savior, and Clark Gregg as the head of S.H.I.E.L.D. Good to see Favreau giving another actor turned director props, (Gregg's directorial debut comes out later this year in the form of Chuck Palahniuk's Choke). I just wish he would have shied away from putting himself in the film. It's one thing to be seen split-second, (like Stan Lee), but its another to give yourself a thankless role with multiple scenes, just adding fuel to the fire on people's opinions of egotism stemming from the drinking game created off of the TV show 'Dinner for Five' and how many references to Swingers was made each episode. I'll forgive, though, because, once again, I'm a big fan.One can't forget that this is an action film above all else, so we can't just praise the actors; every effect is also quite brilliant. Those scenes of Iron Man flying amongst fighter jets in the trailer seemed really lame, but when in context they deliver. The suit itself is amazing as well, through every mach stage right to the end. My main highlight, however, was with the computer systems that Stark utilizes. The multiple screens, instant holographic reproductions, and ability to actually interact with those 3D representations is stunning. We can create them in fantasy, but it's just too bad we can't yet in real life.Now Iron Man is not a perfect film, nor even a perfect comic book adaptation. What it is, though, is a fun, comic actioner that should light up the box office. The final showdown is a bit of a whimper in comparison to the backstory and machine creation; a crucial element is saved from destruction in the one contrived bit of screen writing, (not quite utilized in the way I thought, although still for the same means); and some moments seem a tad campy rather than witty, but otherwise this is some topnotch cinema that should definitely be seen on the big screen. I can't wait to see how the story progresses in a couple years.",8,293,414,29 April 2008
Casino Royale," Shaken or stirred?Casino Royale
","I am not a very big action movie fan. Explosions, violence, and sex don't make a good movie unless there is some semblance of a story involved. Therefore, I've never really had an interest in watching the twenty or so James Bond films. Hearing about the gadgets and the suave hit-man persona told me it wouldn't be too intellectually fulfilling, and if I didn't want to be challenged at the movies I'd see a comedy, not a film pretending to be sophisticated. My fears were made true after seeing Pierce Brosnan's last effort as the superspy, Die Another Day. With its' cloaked car, impossible set pieces, and if I remember correctly time travel? (maybe not that far-fetched, but pretty close to it) I really had no desire to delve into the back catalog. Until now that is. With Daniel Craig coming on as a Bond that bleeds, I really got caught up in the hype and needed to see if one of the most versatile actors today could not only interest me in the series, but breath life into the dying franchise. I must say he did that and more.Craig has been brilliant for years now. Mostly in supporting roles, a nice turn as a mental patient in The Jacket and a better than necessary job in Tomb Raider, he has seen some critical acclaim as a lead with The Mother and 2004's Layer Cake, which showed he could do the spy genre. Craig brings an image to this character of a man who, although unafraid of death, is fallible and willing to make mistakes in order to learn from them. He gives Bond a human quality that was lacking in the little Bond I've seen in the past. By rebooting the franchise, complete with impossible gadgets missing, we see an intellect in what he does. There are no toys to save his life; he must rely on his instincts and judgments to help get him out of the circumstances he finds himself in. You can see the wheels turning behind his eyes and the confidence that he will be able to do what is necessary to keep his Queen and country safe from harm.We are thrown into the action straight off as Bond receives his double-o status. This film is an evolution from reckless rookie to field experienced professional. Bond is rough around the edges throughout the course of the film, making the wrong moves, but always taking the next step to insure success. He realizes the mission and he knows the rules. Our first big action sequence sees him going into an embassy after a man who has evidence he needs. While inside, he realizes that killing someone would mean his country has to give him up as that area is basically a foreign land. The entire scene shows him do everything he can to extract his man, yet never kill anyone. Sure there are explosions and injuries, but he never takes anyone out. Something about this fact really helped me to enter the world on screen; the writers didn't take the easy way out by having him shoot all in his way, they saw the logistics of every situation and problem solved a way to get through them. I'm sure most credit should go to original novelist Ian Fleming, however, one must also applaud those involved with the film for keeping it grounded in realitypossibly Oscar winner Paul Haggis' surprise writing credit has something to do with this.For the first hour and a half you will be on the edge of your seat. The film doesn't take place completely at the titular Casino Royale, but instead on Bond's journey on his way to the top of a criminal organization. There is character development and a process to the top. Also, every supporting character does an amazing job in keeping up appearances of realism. Mads Mikkelsen is menacing as the main villain yet not treated as a cartoon madman. He is not impervious to all but our hero; on the contrary he is doing everything he is in order to cover up a lapse in judgment he made. Also impressive is Eva Green as Vesper Lynd. She is not the kind of woman one would initially think of when compiling a list of possible Bond girls. When one would generally think of supermodel looks and skimpy clothing, like that here of Caterina Murino, Green adds a sophistication and beauty all her own. I think she is at her most gorgeous in a bathroom scene getting ready for the poker match, sans makeup. Just having a Bond girl on screen without makeup is hard to fathom, but her natural beauty shines as a result. She is also a superb actress and hopefully this role will advance her career after critical success in the great Kingdom of Heaven and underrated The Dreamers.Much credit for the success of this film to me lies in the ability to have fantastic action scenes look believable, feel realistic, and progress an intriguing storyline. This isn't action for action's sake, but necessary sequences to show an evolution of character as Bond gets beaten but keeps coming back for more. Casino Royale was by no means a perfect film, however. The wasted role played by Isaach De Bankolé, similar to his in Miami Vice even though the man can act as evidenced in Manderlay and Ghost Dog, and the McGuffin by one of my favorites Jeffery Wright, were a bit out of place and one-dimensional. Also, the final thirty minutes or so fall into Return of the King status as the pace slows to a crawl and could have ended multiple times before finally picking up again at the conclusion. While these moments could have been tweaked at the screenplay level, they don't detract too much from an otherwise great time at the movies.",9,0,2,18 November 2006
La Vie En Rose," How long does a frog live?La Vie en rose
","Why did the American producers decide to rename a foreign film with a foreign title? Doesn't that kind of defeat the purpose? I guess I understand the decision to use one of Edith Piaf's more famous songs as the name of the film about her, but they could have gotten away with La Môme (The Kid). Either way La Vie en rose is a heartbreaking story about a woman finding success despite a horrid childhood. With problem after problem growing up, always being kicked to the gutter and taken from those who truly loved her, it might be this abandonment that made her overnight success so potent to her. The portrayal here of Piaf is not one of a great woman. She is actually quite unsympathetic at times, heavy on the ego with sparse flashes of the love that she never received. At times though, we can begin to see inside her head, when she begs to go back on stage after a collapse, she says she must sing one song in order to keep faith in herself. Her voice is the only thing that saved her from the life of solitude and prostitution that otherwise waited. That gift from Saint Theresa was a sacred one to her and she would guard it with her life, no matter how many people were hurt along the way.Here is a shy young woman, thrust into the limelight with a voice unlike any other. Lauded with praise at every turn, she becomes knowledgeable of her skill and it is a chore to break out of her bad habits when a true performer offers to help her leave the bar scene for the stage. Piaf becomes an international sensation, but it appears that her guardian angel needed something in return for her good fortune. At every turn for the better in her career, only a devastating setback in her personal life awaited. Left with her grandmothers while her parents pursued their dreams of failure, she found herself blinded from infection for a spell; taken from a motherly whorethe one person who truly loved her; stricken with arthritis; involved in a car crash; fingered as an accomplice in the murder of the man who got her off the streets; overcome by jaundice; losing the one man she ever saw as her equal in life; and a death too soon around the age of 50. As she sings in her final moment on screen, however, she lived with no regrets.Piaf, as seen here, is the godmother of rock and roll. Between the drugs, the alcohol, the men, the ego, and the Diva requests, she was a star. How much of this hard lifestyle helped in accelerating her deterioration or how much it helped her cope with the pain in order to go on when she couldn't, who knows? One thing is for certain, though, she had an iron-strong will to continue and never looked back. One pause, one break and she might find herself back on the streets. There was no way that would ever happen.The story on display is very intriguing and devastating in its mixture of extreme elation and utter suffering. My gripe is with the way the filmmakers decided to show it to us. We are thrown from 1918 to 1963 to 1936 to 1955 onto 1960 without any regard for keeping us, as the audience, grounded at all. I'm not saying it was confusing, in actuality a lot of the transitions made perfect sense. What ends up happening is that it feels like a puzzle hastily thrown together and jumbled up. People crop up that we haven't seen in forever and you have to really think, 'are we back in time or is that him in the present?' Only one instance truly angered me and that is with a hidden tragedy sprung on us right at the end of the film. Talk about probably the most devastating event to happen to her and we get it shown to us on her deathbed almost like the director saying, 'You thought she had it bad, listen to this one' I don't want to totally dismiss the direction, though, because there are some amazing sequences. The one that shoots to the front of my mind is of a long-take involving Piaf finding out she has been hallucinating and someone she holds dear has passed away. Her fear becomes devastation and complete loss of control as she continues down the hall of her house onto the stage of a theatre, seamlessly spun into a performance. It's just a gorgeous scene to behold.While the film itself is lacking, you still need to watch for the amazing performance by Marion Cotillard as Piaf. Say what you will about the Oscar winning makeup allowing her to embody different stages of her life, it is really the Oscar winning performance that sells each moment. The shaking in her crippling years, the drunkenness pretty much every year, the naivete as a young girl, and the slow degradation of her mind in middle age are all portrayed with precision and attention to detail. Sure she is not singing herself, but her actions pull off every performance. When she takes the stage for the first time after leaving the streets we are shown her debut as a true performer. We do not hear the words at all; just the orchestra's playing. Instead we are shown Cotillard fully transformed into Piaf, onstage, composed, and singing with her beautiful hands, touching each audience member to laughter, jubilation, and tears. A fantastic performance that outshines the film itself, Cotillard alone is why you should take a look at the tragic life of this French Sparrow.",7,2,5,25 February 2008
Vicky Cristina Barcelona," Counter-intuitive loveVicky Cristina Barcelona
","I really love the poster for this film. I had to get that out there. The composition and motion is just stunning. Artistry orchestrated for just the right emotion and aesthetic, something you could say about the movie itself. Vicky Cristina Barcelona is a gorgeous piece to view. Not to disregard Woody Allen at all, but I have to credit this look to cinematographer Javier Aguirresarobe. The man acted as DP on some of my favorite Spanish filmsHable con ella and Mar adentroand now has me anticipating John Hillcoat's forthcoming The Road even more. Truthfully, besides the obligatory serif font, white on black, utilized in the opening credits, you would be somewhat hard-pressed to even realize that this is an Allen film. Europe definitely inspired the man and I'm happy for it. Whether the likes of Gaudio worked as a muse to him like they did to his characters, I don't know. What I do, though, is that he could never have made this film anywhere but in Barcelona. The beauty, the intrigue, the exoticness; they all overpower the people moving through the story as well as us watching it all unfold.Let me say something right offI didn't really get this movie. I'm not even sure if there is something to get. On a purely aesthetic level, it is fantastic. The visuals, the art and culture on display, the use of language, and even a wonderfully successful third person narrator make this a creative and stimulating work. I don't want to belittle the writing or the story in any way; I just didn't quite get what we were being shown. Without ruining anything, not only do our characters finish at the same place from where they began, but also the narrator pretty much repeats his description from the start, at the close. Sure the events that occur shape their lives at that specific period of time, but neither really do anything about it. Maybe they learned something about themselves, maybe they experienced an intrinsic moment that will leave an indelible mark forever, but when all is said and done, both our leads, Vicky and Cristina, do not evolve. Whether it be a carefully planned out future or one filled with the knowledge of what she doesn't want, unknowing of what she does, our conclusion is so open-ended that it truly begs the question of if this story even needed to be told.Don't get me wrong, I really enjoyed my time, and there lies my quandary. How can I enjoy something I don't feel was a necessity to be seen? How can I recommend something that I myself deem as inconsequential without any progression in plot? The answer of course is the beauty of that which is art. Art is in the eye of the beholder. What you see doesn't have to make complete sense; it doesn't have to make you happy, it may, in fact, absolutely incense you. The sheer ability to touch you in some unquantifiable way, some level of consciousness that you can't even comprehend is enough. To know it touched you without the need for reason can be more powerful than anything else. The emotions on screen, the relationships on display, all hit you viscerally and physically. The raw power of the love triangles and quadrangles stimulate the mind more than any linear tale of young Americans finding their way in a foreign land. Life is messy and irrational; Allen sees this and paints his canvas like such.The mixture of intellectual conversation, the brilliance of Javier Bardem's Juan Antonio seducing these women, not with his looks, but with his soul, is a refreshing thing to behold. His brazen confidence laced with a passion and vigor for life is a powerful weapon. While all he needs is sexual power and exotic backgrounds to woo Cristina, (Scarlet Johansson's free spirited roaming soul), he can still entrance Vicky, (Rebecca Hall's amazing turn as the rationally sheltered woman unable to follow her feelings), with his rhetoric and intellect, stories of poets and love for simple music done well, even at twelve in the morning. Never confused about what he wants, Bardem is bluntly honest at all times. He does not shy from the fact he still loves his ex-wife, nor that he is attracted to both girls. Always truthful, he is a genuine lover of life, if something doesn't work out at least he had his time of happiness. One can't dwell in pain or loss, as no one knows what path the future holds. What might not have worked now doesn't necessarily have to be broken later on.Along with the visuals come these gem performances. Bardem is amazing as the puzzle piece linking everything together, stirring the pot while also being its most important ingredient. Johansson, I must say, was really good. She never annoyed me and effectively played the naïve American, thinking she is this open spirit without the knowledge of what practicing her thoughts could lead to. She may not be as open in love as she thought, but then without the experience how could she ever know? As for Hall, I have to say she was somewhat of a revelation. The one actor I was in the dark about outshone them all with her range of emotion, hiding behind her safe life and husband while torn inside about the passion she desires, but is too afraid to consume. And I must mention Penelope Cruz who comes in like a whirlwind and never stops. She is the wild card in this little game, acting as both the glue and volatile fire. None of these four could be removed from the machine and still achieve success. Allen has crafted a tight web of romance that, while it may not lead anywhere, still brings forth a journey worth taking. If nothing else it's a beast befitting a voyeuristic glance.",8,2,6,3 September 2008
Elizabeth: The Golden Age," I will live right until the endElizabeth: The Golden Age
","Whereas Elizabeth told a tale of royalty and the politics underlying every action to gain power, Elizabeth: The Golden Age weaves the story of how that strength survives. Michael Hirst gets help this time from the capable William Nicholson to explain what happens once the queen has proved her worth. The country has accepted her, yet many Catholic dissenters hide behind Mary Stuart, looking for an overthrow. Outside her kingdom sees Spain reviling her crown, standing against the God they hold dear. King Philip has a plan that will use Elizabeth's most trusted advisors' loyalty against her. This is a time where religion hangs over everything heavily. One cannot become a leader without God's acceptance and one cannot start a war without that permission either. As a result, the story starts off at a subtle pace, slowly unraveling the conspiracies at play, to later crank up the suspense for a war that will shape the world as we know it today.The years between the two films has seen director Shekhar Kapur hone his skills and develop an aesthetic much flashier here than its predecessor. Yes, he had the majesty of set and wardrobe in the first film, but here he takes it to the next level. Elizabeth begins in power; therefore she must show off her royal beauty. The movie can be seen as one of over-extravagance, but I don't think it ever goes too far. Kapur's attention to detail should be commended, and while the visuals are stunning and at times overwhelming, they never are at the detriment to the story being told. This can't quite be said about the cinematography. He appears to be a bit over his head on composition, giving us many instances that beg the question, why did he do that? One such moment, at the end, shows Geoffrey Rush (reprising his role of Walsingham to much the same accomplishment) lying on his bed through a pinhole gap in the ceiling. The screen is black besides the small opening with its blurred edges. Not only is it strange, but it lasts for only about five seconds before cutting back to a normal vantage point. Another example is of the queen standing to the left of the screen while a column fills the other five-sixths. She isn't even showed in full, but allows a bit of her dress to go behind the obstruction. Awkward moments like this seem out of place and take the viewer out of the worka little misguided auteurism.I can't fault him too much for these transgressions, as there are just as many instances of pure beauty. From Sir Walter Raleigh swimming underwater while ships burn above him to the execution of Mary Stuart, Kapur gives his share of emotionally stunning sequences. Give him a weighty score and the ability to film in slow motion and let him do his thing. Even the many times he portrays metaphors and allusions to faith and God are done so with a deft hand. The shadow of religion covering most of the proceedings help allow him to get away with it, as that was a standard of the time, but he never lets them become too heavy-handed or laughably easy. I also give him credit for knowing his limits and instead of showing horrid action/war scenes, he holds back to only shoot the destruction the war creates. Maybe it was his experience with battles on the critically panned Four Feathers (I can't weigh in here as I haven't seen the film), but his masking the fighting with only explosions and aftermath works effectively.Just as with Elizabeth, The Golden Age's aesthetic, great as it is, only equals the acting on display. With both Rush and Cate Blanchett returning, one could not ask for more. Blanchett shows her strength at all times while also letting a bit of her dreams for a normal life seep through. When she is with her favorite 'lady in waiting' Bess, a nice turn from Abbie Cornish, or alone with Raleigh, her true self shows through the façade of stoic leadership. She longs for a love affair, but not so much that she would sacrifice the people she rules. Her ability to hold to her word that she will protect everyone of England, no matter their religious preference and to even go to the front lines while they fight for her, (a nice scene even if the speech was a tad lackluster) shows her humanity and greatness.Kapur has assembled another dream cast of British stars to support his lead. Clive Owen, as Raleigh, is the perfect amount of charisma and self-assured defiance needed to make his role believable. In order to have the queen's full respect, he had to stand up for himself no matter what she might do as a result. Samantha Morton is fantastic as Mary Stuart. The role is somewhat of a MacGuffin, but effective nonetheless; hopefully she will take more roles as the villain in the future. She is a great actress and it's nice to see her branch out of the heroine mode. There are many other familiar faces, all doing an admirable job to keep appearances up for this wonderful period piece. One more of notice, however, is the almost unrecognizable Rhys Ifans. Completely gone is the goofiness I know him for from films such as Notting Hill and Human Nature. What a surprise he is playing the Jesuit priest on a mission from Spain that no one quite knows until it is too late.",8,3,7,16 October 2007
The Deer Hunter," One shot
","Michael Cimino's masterpiece The Deer Hunter is one of the greatest films ever made. Concerning a group of steel worker friends in Pennsylvania, the movie shows us the comradery and good natured fun they enjoy together leading up to their departure for Vietnam. We open on the day of Stevie's (John Savage) wedding, a joyous time before the hell that will soon swallow them whole. A very traditional Russian ceremony leads into a raucous reception at a friend's bar (George Dzundza), where at its conclusion Robert De Niro's Michael and Christopher Walken's Nick make a pact to not leave each other behind during the war. These two are best friends of the kind that nothing else matters. Michael says before their deer hunt, one last go before shipping off, that if it wasn't for Nick he'd go alone, the other guys are just idiots, he doesn't need them.There is an abrupt cut over to the jungles and helicopters of Vietnam. De Niro is killing with anger in his eyes; the hunt has higher stakes now that humans are involved. Who knows how much time has passed, but coming off the helicopter is Nick and Stevie, physically having to hit Michael out of his cold stare to acknowledge the reunion. It's short lived, however, as they are captured and taken to a hut to be used in a game of Russian Roulette for entertainment. Here is where we see the leadership Michael has had all his life come to the front. Only he has the courage to get them through the game for an escape. Once he and Nick carry Stevie off into the jungle and see a friendly aircraft to save them, we reach the moment of disconnection. Savage's Stevie is in no shape to board the chopper and after Nick goes in, De Niro jumps down to save his friend. This one action leads each character down a path they cannot turn away from. Michael knows his friend Nick is safely away and that he can bring Stevie to safety, Stevie realizes the utter futility of his situation and the lack of courage to have pulled through without Michael, and Nick knows nothing of his friends, but the abandonment of being saved and letting them be lost down in the trenches.Stevie's disillusion, Michael's strength of character, and Nick's sense of abandoning those he loved will drive them throughout the rest of the epic three-hour film. The acting is riveting and the emotion palpable. What of their travails can be spoken of upon returning home, shells of the men they were before? The war has scarred them to the point where they are distant to their friends who wish to shower them with love that they don't think they can share anymore. De Niro's second hunt towards the end of the film perfectly shows his evolution, once he stands face to face with his tracked buck and realizes what he must do. De Niro is entrancing throughout and gives one of the greatest performances of his career. He is the tough guy, older brother to his friends who must sacrifice his own happiness for those he loves.Besides the three main actors, the supporting cast holds true throughout. The late great John Cazale plays the friend whose attitude can be forgiven in the beginning, but not post-war, where he becomes childish and unlearned in the real value of life. A late confrontation with De Niro is a powerful scene showing the huge distance Vietnam has put between those who went and those who stayed. Dzundza is a giant teddy-bear of a man constantly shown with an infectious smile and good-natured life. Meryl Streep is top-notch, as always, playing the woman loved by both Nick and Michael. Her photo becomes the main crux of the film when De Niro's glimpse of it tells him he must go back home after he made sure his friends were out of the line of fire and Walken's glimpse just reminds him of those he thinks he left behind and seals his decision to never return to America. Christopher Walken is by far the showstopper. His slow and believable descent into hell is heartwrenching to watch. What once was a fun-loving man, looking to marriage upon return home, becomes a broken vessel with no reason to live. The climax of he and De Niro sitting across from each other in one last game of Russian Roulette will be ingrained in your mind forever.",10,0,0,22 July 2006
Beowulf," Sins of the fatherBeowulf
","Let's start this out with the fact that my College Professor of World Civ had us read The Epic of Gilgamesh rather than the one adapted here with Beowulf. So, I went into the film without really knowing anything of the story besides the monster Grendel and the obligatory pride as a curse, creating your own demons, etc. As shown on screen, it is obvious that the yarn is an ancient one. Besides the archaic traditionsQueens are inherited as the wife of all who take the crown?it just feels dated and plods along as a result. I like the whole idea of our hero being his own worst enemy, but I would have enjoyed seeing a bit more conflict. The fight with Grendel and the dragon are both magnificent to behold, it's a shame then that the true orchestrator of the chaos, stunningly played by Angelina Jolie, is ultimately lacking in depth and competition. It actually feels like how I'm sure most students do when reading the epic poemlong-winded, repetitive, and missing the nonstop action our MTV-cultured minds love.If I were to compare the animation to something, I would not go to 300, as most seem to be doing. Sure the whole 'I am BEOWULF!' thing is a direct rip-off, but the aesthetic and story is not. In my opinion, 300 blows this one out of the water, no question. To think of something similar, my mind goes to Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within, a great little gem from almost a decade ago. The technology has come far since then, most notably with the fluidity of character movement, detail of liquids/hair/textures, and emotive ability in those moments that succeed with it. However, as far as looks go for the humans, I have to declare Final Fantasy the winner still. The faces in Beowulf continue to keep a plastic/rubber feel, giving the impression everyone had a facelift. Besides the hair on each face, especially the noses, the pores and skin quality so lifelike years ago looks creepy here, as it did in Robert Zemeckis' Polar Express, (I don't fault Monster House because it was stylish and cartoony, not attempting to be realistic).Those faults withstanding, it was a pleasure to view the film in IMAX-3D. Zemeckis utilizes the technology well, giving us moments of true depth. Whether flying through the tree branches, having a spear frozen in front of our eyes, watching bodies fall and flip towards us, and seeing blood splattered in our faces, we are thrown smack dab in the middle of the action. Water and blood are realistic and, along with fire and smoke, shown with nice field of vision, never seeming like a flat plane placed on top of the layer beneath it. The effects are so good, it might have been the best film I've seen using the gimmick. Having seen only three others, however, I'm not so sure that is too bold of a statement.As far as the acting goes, I think most performances are a bit too over-the-top. I almost wish all the characters were devoid of any likenesses to their real-life counterparts like our lead. It is just too distracting, leading my mind to wander and think of how the cgi person differs from the actor. This is especially true with John Malkovich's Unferth. They try to make him different enough, but the face is still there and the horrible Danish accent is just too much. The only really good turns, to me, were Ray Winstone, Brendan Gleeson, and Crispin Glover. I would add Robin Wright Penn to the list, but her smooth/taut face didn't allow for any nuance to go with her voice's portrayal. Winstone, as Beowulf is the best. With very little likeness, he is allowed to create a full figure. The facial are expressions genuine and moving, especially when he realizes the pact he made with the devil and later on when he puts his life on the line for those he loves. Gleeson is a stalwart of the craft and comes across much like he would if it was really he on screen, and Glover proves to be a master of elasticity and quirky movement. No one else could have been the stand-in for Grendel.Artistically, the film is stunning to behold. Everything seems to have been lifted from the story correctly. Jolie's devil is a disgusting creature only shown as beautiful through the warped minds of menthe use of reflections to show this fact is great. Also, the fact that our original King's curse of an heir was his shame, manifested by a hideous creature made to hear every word spoken about him through super hearing, and Beowulf's was his vanity, displayed by an Adonis of an offspring, showed the detail that went into the artistic direction. Unfortunately, while it visually held true to the tale, it might have adhered to the source a bit too much script-wise. It is a morality tale that drives its point home too forcefully, repeating itself often, leaving the audience cold and annoyed. If you want to see this film, do yourself a favor and spend the extra cash on the IMAX-3D experience. Without the visuals to preoccupy you, the film doesn't quite deliver. Our hero says to his wife, 'Don't remember me as your King or a hero, but instead as a man, fallible and flawed.' He could have said it about the movie itself, but instead of being modest and touching for his character, it is ultimately a derogatory view for the work, something I'm sure the filmmakers hoped would be seen as glorious.",6,0,2,20 November 2007
Live Free or Die Hard," Is the circus in town?Live Free or Die Hard
","Since I don't consider watching movies on edited TV as really watching the movie, I have never seen an installment of the Die Hard series. As a result, the fourth film, Live Free or Die Hard has been my first foray into John McClane's one man against the world antics. Now this is actually somewhat ironic because in order to get the PG-13 rating that the producers wanted, there has been a lot of overdubbing of lines, and it's noticeable. So in effect, my first experience with this action series has been an edited theatre viewingI'm sure I'm not the only one to find that humorous. Despite the cleaning up of language, however, this film really delivers on all promises. We are given non-stop action, explosions galore, a somewhat intelligent screenplay, and terrific one-liners to lighten up any overwrought moments. Like Mission Impossible 3 last year, this film really opened my eyes to how entertainingly good action flicks can be.Now, what I know about the first three films is that it is always a European baddie terrorizing the US so that McClane can save the day. Here, though, we have an American leading the destruction in order to show how vulnerable our government is. I found this an intriguing way to freshen the concept while commentating on current events and the need to look on all sides for the enemy. Because we don't get the outsider foe, we in effect don't get a one-man show to pit against Bruce Willis' McClane. Sure we have Timothy Olyphant, doing what he does best as in films like Go and Girl Next Door, leading the crew, but as Willis cracks, he has many henchmen at his side doing all the dirty work. As a result, the enemy by committee doesn't quite succeed in holding terror over the audience. Instead it is the total annihilation of all computer and electronic devices in the country that is the true feared entity, although Maggie Q does do a nice job at showing some martial arts activity. The fight between her and Willis is at once awesome, funny, and brutal. (Is it just me though, or is it weird that all the computer geeks on the good side are nerds and those on the bad side are built for war once their keystrokes are complete?)Because of the high-tech storyline, Willis can't do it all by himself. He does try, very admirably, and shows that age is not a factor in him still being one of the best action stars around. His comedic delivery is right on and he just knows how to kill and destroy with brute force. John McClane is definitely a guy that punches first and asks questions later. But I guess if he's been on the other end of craziness like this for three past films, he has the right to do so. This old-school mentality can't succeed alone in a film of this era of electronics and because of this we get the Mac himself, Justin Long, to help out. I will admit that although a fan, I really didn't think any good could come of this casting. Thankfully I was wrong because he really does a good job at playing off Willis and getting it done as far as what is needed hacker-wise.Besides Willis stealing the movie with his charisma, the film's action sequences are fantastic. Len Wiseman, of Underworld fame, has really upped the ante and infused this movie with explosions left and right. Between a helicopter being killed by a car, an on-ramp bridge being destroyed by an F-18 at close range, and an elevator shaft sequence perfectly orchestrated, we also get Cyril Raffaelli doing acrobatic fighting and contorting in order to fall from huge heights and yet able to get right back up. The bells and whistles rarely interest me enough to keep from being bored, but I must say this one fired on all cylinders to great effect. Even Kevin Smith's small cameo brought a smile to my face. Again like MI3's Simon Pegg role, Smith delivers a gem of a comic relief part at just the right time to lead into our final car chase/utter destruction sequence. If this is the fourth installment and it is this enjoyable, I can't wait to finally visit the originals, because if they are better, I'm in for a fun time.",7,0,1,30 June 2007
Rear Window," Call it female intuitionRear Window
","After seeing Alfred Hitchcock's classic Rear Window for the second time, I am even more convinced that the broo-haha surrounding Disturbia and its ripping it off was uncalled for. Besides the premise of a person confined to their window, seeing what they think is a murder, the two could not be anymore different. This film is one that will never age, whether it story, acting, or sheer inventiveness in its execution. Only Hitchcock could build the suspense as high as he does for almost two hours never leaving one room the entire time. Our hero is in a full leg cast and a prisoner to his room and window. Besides that interior, everything else we see is from his vantage point across to the rest of the apartment complex and a sliver of space opening to the street beyond. A clinic or choreography and showing us only what we need to know, Rear Window leaves you guessing right up until the final scene, unaware of what the whole truth to the situation is.Technically, the film has no flaws. Its utilization of a pivoting camera that pans left to right out L.B. Jefferies apartment is one-of-a-kind. With only the zooms from his camera lens and binoculars, we are allowed to see everything he does, letting us as the audience come to our own conclusions as well as become a part of his. This is a slow burn of a story, revealing each new discovery as though the layers of an onion peeled away. The sheer amount of rehearsals must have been staggering. There are plenty of long takes that go from window to window, catching the precise moment of activity we need in order to continue the story. Each actor had to be able to hit their mark at the exact moment necessary; timed to perfection. It is a joy to think about the work that went into the film every time we are shown characters moving from room to room, stopping at each window for our benefit, yet never feeling unnatural. Full credit goes to the cinematographer for orchestrating it all.The premise and craft are not the only things going for it. Acting-wise, there is not one misstep. James Stewart truly was the greatest actor of his generation. His delivery is uncanny and he can go from serious drama to light comedy without a blink. There is a lot of heavy emotional tension between him and his girlfriend that is treated with the same amount of care every other plot thread is. His relationship with Lisa Fremont, the gorgeous Grace Kelly, is mirrored in that of the quarrels and love trysts happening all around him. Without the murder mystery and the peeping into the lives of other couples, they may end up breaking up forever. His middle-class upbringing and photojournalist lifestyle just doesn't match well with her patrician ways and necessity of wearing a dress only once to keep appearances up for her job. The two could not be anymore different except for the fact they are madly in love with the other.Kelly is not just a pretty face either. Her performance is realistic at all times, keeping up with Stewart's sarcastic wit and playing the girlfriend being spurned all while slowly becoming engrossed in the story of the Thorwalds across the way. She becomes a photojournalist herself in many ways, looking through the camera and coming to conclusions for what the story may entail. In opposition to this, Stewart morphs into that which he thinks can never change in his love, her ability to stay on the fringe while others do the hard labor. Many times towards the end, he is the one left to watch others risk their safety for his manifested theories. He himself is the helpless being unable to go into the trenches, but instead prepare everything for the others to carry out. Whether Thorwald killed his wife or she has taken a train to visit family, the hold the mystery has on them finally shows the two what the other goes through and their respect for the other blossoms to become as strong as their love.My favorite aspect of the complete achievement, however, is the levity infused at all times. Sure the subject matter is very seriousI wouldn't be surprised if it was at first created to be a commentary on the Red Scare and worrying about what your neighbors could be up tobut at every turn we get witty banter helping to alleviate the tension and give us viewers a breather. Stewart and Kelly are quite the team and they perform the words of John Michael Hayes' script with ease. The timing is superb and many of the best lines are mixed into the dramatic dialogue always breaking up the suspense. We aren't talking gags and jokes, but instead puns and sly shots taken as a result of the conversations at hand. This is one smart script and I find myself even more interested in seeing The Man Who Knew Too Muchthe second version Hitchcock directedto see how well the team does, joined together again.",10,1,3,1 December 2007
300," Sparta!300
","This is what film was destined to evolve to. After decades of directors making storyboards as reference before filming and the slow building trend to adapt comic book work, we finally have the ultimate fusion of both. Sure Sin City did amazing things with the medium and created frame-by-frame transfers from drawing to celluloid, however, it was still shot as a movie first and foremost. Zack Snyder has done something different with 300; he has created a true work of art. Frank Miller's story was one steeped in truth and history if not entirely non-fiction. The heightened reality came across in the stylized drawings of the graphic novel and the honor and respect held in such high regard by its characters. Snyder takes these aspects to another level with his film, creating some of the most brutal yet beautiful moments I've seen at the movies. The artistry is gorgeous to behold and the story and acting only enhance the quality with deeper meaning. What Picasso's Guernica is to painting, an epic portrayal of war and death and the hope that can come out of it all, 300 is to cinema.I am surprised how the huge success so far for this film needs to be footnoted with the fact that it has a starless cast. To me, this is a slap in the face of all the great talent involved. Gerard Butler, for one, has steadily risen in the acting ranks and just cements his talent with this role as Spartan King Leonidas. He has the rugged physique and harsh mentality of a true warrior, but also the compassion needed to lead a band of soldiers to their death and the love for not only land and country, but also wife and childtheir freedom being the reason he needs Sparta to stay safe from tyranny. Then you have the beautiful Lena Headey, the actress that was forced into Terry Gilliam's Brother's Grimm after producers refused to let Samantha Morton have the role. Knowing Gilliam's history with Hollywood and being forced to do so many things against his will, the words saying that Headey actually did the role justice to his vision means wonders. To be complimented for a part he had a singular vision for can only prove the worth she holds. I still want to see last year's Imagine Me and You, the kind of chick flick that looks like it could be a really good film. Lastly you have the up-and- coming David Wenham, one of the best performances, in my opinion, throughout the entire Lord of the Rings trilogy. After a fun role in the dreadful Van Helsing and a total metamorphosis in The Proposition, I believe he has some great things ahead of him. Even Dominic West as the treacherous Theron surprised me. After his laughable acting in The Forgotten, I couldn't believe this was the same guy. I have never seen 'The Wire,' but maybe the guy has some talent after all.Again, though, no matter how effective the acting was, the true strength of the film was in the overall aesthetic. Sure many scenes were culled perfectly from the comic, but Snyder also put his own flare to it. Not only was the role of Queen Gorgo expanded from a single drawn frame to integral role of the film, but it was done so successfully. When I heard of the expansion I sort of chuckled, thinking here is an infusion of femininity in an otherwise macho storyif for nothing else, but to add a reason to have some sexuality and nudity in this hard-R movie. Instead it is her character's drive back home in Sparta against the villainous Theron that makes the final moments as poignant as they are. While the comic gave us an insight into a warrior fighting for freedom of men, the addition of the Queen here gives us the story of a man fighting for the freedom of humanity and equality of all those living on earth. The softer side of the king makes his brutality that much more necessary and his love for his wife the reason he is so ready to give his life for the war. The only addition I disliked in the entire film was that of a grotesque creature/decapitating machine. The 'monsters' in the story are supposed to be elephants and inbred freaks of nature, (this is ancient Greece), not monstrosities fixed with blades as arms. I find myself forgiving it though because it was on screen for so short a time, and the only misstep I saw. Zack Snyder has outdone himself. I enjoyed his remake of Dawn of the Dead, but didn't quite understand the critics when they said he had an immense talent and hold on how to shoot and craft scenes. 300 definitely showed me this to be true. Whether light scenes of stunning visuals like the dance of the oracle or dark sequences of battle and splattering blood, he succeeds with them all. The first long take of Leonidas fighting through Persian after Persian with the speed slowed and increased while the zoom jumps forward and back is amazing and makes the hallway fight scene in Oldboy seem like child's play. This is truly the first great film of 2007, whether it stays atop my favorites at the end of the year remains to be seen, but right now it sits above all with quite a gap in between.",10,5,12,11 March 2007
The Ugly Truth," It's called a Stairmaster  The Ugly Truth
","Do you want to know the ugly truth about The Ugly Truth? Well, besides being obvious and banal cinematically, it made me laugh  a lot actually. Romantic comedies usually have one thing going for them and that is predictability. While this one has it in spades, what surprised me was how crude and crass the humor ended up being. And that's a very good thing because those instances brought on the biggest laughs of them all. One could guess there would be a few moments, especially after watching the trailer and seeing Gerard Butler's character being the epitome of alpha male, however, one would never anticipate a dinner party scene involving vibrating panties and a young child that loves objects resembling remote controls. But I'll tell you, set-ups like that were what kept me invested in the mediocre story, it definitely wasn't the manufactured chemistry between the leads.Everything revolves around our heroine Abby, played by Katherine Heigl. It is definitely a role that she has proved herself willing to portray, the strong-willed, professional beauty left by the wayside in regards to the other sex. She produces a successful morning show that just can't win in the ratings. Her cohorts are as conservative as she, willing to do a piece about the mayor to try and drive viewership back their way, shaking their heads when risqué ideas are batted around. Her boss, however, decides to hire 'shock-jock' of sorts Mike who has been cultivating a following on cable access with his insight into the truth about relationships. His callous nature and unwavering ability to say exactly what is on his mind breaths life back into Abby's show despite the trepidation of lowering herself to the kind of television she has always abhorred. She can be swayed, however, once Butler's Mike agrees to play Cyrano to her Christian in wooing her dating checklist approved neighbor Colin. Like that French film, though, and all its many copies, we all know who is really falling in love in the end.Legally Blonde's Robert Luketic is behind the camera for this one and I'll admit that he tries his best to use the script in order to keep the audience on their toes. With subtle silent tricks, (introducing Mike's nephew and sister in a way to make us completely believe they are his son and wife), as well as a fearless use of language and sexual innuendo, (bravo to the studio for letting them take the R-rating and run with it), definitely got this guy—as in me—to stay alert while awaiting the next comedic gag. And while I didn't quite believe the romantic chemistry between Butler and Heigl, their relationship as buddies worked swimmingly. The beginning of their pact—to get her Colin and he respect on the set—where Mike coaches her on how to recover from the desperate call for a date is paced perfectly and acted just right. His over-zealous confidence and her naivety to it all becomes a great one-two punch. One that works just as well when she turns the table by proving she can flirt after a very funny shopping sequence where Mike is the one approving her wardrobe.And it's that aspect that worked for me too, seeing the guy be the relationship guru for the girl. Sure you want to think that he is wrong, you want to take offense to things he is saying as a guy—willing yourself to believe that he isn't speaking about you—but the sad truth is, it's all probably not that far off. He is so right when he says he doesn't understand romance or love, but that he is a master at lust and manipulation. His methods work and they are foolproof, but as we realize towards the end, along with Abby, the bond they acquire is never lasting. If you have to be a generic type to win someone's heart, well, you will never be happy. The ugly truth, therefore, is that dating is hard and relationships take work, but if you aren't honest with yourself or your significant other, it is all a lie that will only end in heartbreak.I'd like to give some credit to the supporting cast, but, frankly, they aren't on screen very much. This is the Katherine and Gerard show through and through. John Michael Higgins and Cheryl Hines do their best to steal some thunder, yet, thinking back, their most successful moments are a result of reactions to what Butler and/or Heigl did. If there was one guy that I really enjoyed in the background, and he is very quietly effective here, it would be Jesse D. Goins. His brief seconds of screen time, with either a facial expression or quick quip, are gold. The rest of the movie does rely on the stars and I applaud them for doing an admirable job. Why Butler needed to fake an American accent is beyond me, (his face just looked weird as he tried so hard to hide the Scottish), and Heigl's smugness rubs me the wrong way every time, but I was able to look past those crutches. If I could give The Ugly Truth any words of encouragement, it would be that my girlfriend loved it. So, if it fires on all cylinders for the demographic it's marketed to, and kept me laughing enough to forget how mediocre the actual story was, I guess, when all is said and done, it does do a pretty darn good job.",5,33,55,21 July 2009
Moon," Dad, there's someone asking about Mom  Moon
","Moon is ostensibly a one-man show featuring Sam Rockwell as an astronaut sent to the moon on a three-year contract to maintain a mining station that harvests the sun's fusion energy from moonrocks. We are thrown into the mix with only two weeks left in his tenure, the desire to return to his wife and daughter, whom he has never seen in real life yet, strong and his psyche all but ready to break from the lack of human interaction. Sam Bell has been keeping busy by utilizing a treadmill, watching old Nick at Nite type sitcoms, whittling away at a wooden model of his hometown with an X-acto knife, and conversing with the station's artificial intelligence GERTY. The live feed to Earth has been disengaged for a while now, leaving this monotonous voice and bright yellow smiley face—complete with changing expressions—of Kevin Spacey his only friend. Sure he gets to record video packages for his wife and bosses at Lunar Industries, and they reply back to him, but the distance needed to travel is great and the time between too long.Cabin fever has definitely set in as Sam begins to zone out and manifest a woman, first sitting down in his chair and then out on the moon's surface while he is out for a routine check. Both instances cause him to forget what he was doing, causing great personal harm and injury. When the real trouble occurs, however, is the moment—as seen in the trailer—he brings back a body from the surface that appears, for all intents and purposes, to be him. This is the point where talking about Moon gets a little difficult so as to not ruin the mystery that should be unsolved when you sit down to watch the film. The trailer portrays a story that seems to beg the question of whether the second Sam is truly there or only in his imagination as he slowly goes insane. I won't divulge the answer, but instead say that it gets solved fairly quickly. So, instead of the film becoming a psychological thriller with a big reveal at its conclusion, Duncan Jones' story becomes complete science fiction, bringing in moral questions about technological advances we in 2009 are just beginning to wrestle with.This aspect, while at first threatening to ruin my experience as I entered thinking the question of whether Sam number two was real or not would be the backbone to the tale, became so important to my enjoyment. Rather than a look inside the psyche of this man, isolated for so long, we are given a tense race against time as Sam must discover what is happening and think of a way to get out from under it all before the ELIZA rescue team arrives from Earth, an event that could have very dire consequences. I don't want to ruin too much, but let me just say that the clock is counting down to his death, an ending that could be caused by many different factors, (failing health, execution by those coming, etc.), that also begs the question of whether he is in fact alive in the first place. I have to say that Jones and screenwriter Nathan Parker put together a taut thrill ride that will keep you on the edge of your seat. The pacing is deliberate and rapid all at the same time, the art direction pristine, and the camera tricks very impressive.Sam Rockwell is a major part of this as it is definitely the best work of his career. Not only is he on screen for the entire run time, about 80% of it is playing opposite a computer or himself. The pressures being put upon his shoulders, the fear of what may be happening, about his very own existence, weigh down his emotional strength and it shows. The outbursts, the sarcasm, the joking around to anger his doppelganger, and the heartbreaking realization of what is going on show through with perfection. This is his shining moment, proving his craft and ability to act above and beyond the 'funny guy' he is often relegated to play. Especially when pitted against such a stark background of clinical white futuristic rooms or the vacuum of space, the angst, joy, disbelief, and fortitude of his humanity are all that we are able to see, his performance is paramount to the film's success.I know that, as far as storyline goes, this review remains somewhat vague besides expressing the visceral tension and underlying mystery waiting to be solved, but I believe that is for your own viewing pleasure. While the trailer is not necessarily misleading, it posits a question that is answered early on as being the main crux of the entire film. That possibility of more than one Sam Bell or of a man who's hold of reality has been broken may be what you went into the film expecting to see. Well you will just see it sooner than expected and as a lead into the real story of survival, identity, and the idea of home. In that respect, having the trailer's mystery solved only means more time for unexpected story lines; it may have gotten you into the seats, but it is only the beginning of what this science fiction classic-in-waiting has to offer.",10,45,68,11 July 2009
Happy Feet," Happy Feet = Brainwashing Propaganda
","There will be spoilers, however, I highly recommend you not waste your money on this atrocity anyway, so please read on.Let me preface this rant with the fact that I am neither religious nor political. I could care less that liberal Hollywood treats their movies as agenda pushing media because I like a good story. The Constant Gardener really played with your sensibilities about what is happening in African countries and whatnot and how America is the cause, etc. However, the film was about love and the union between two people, and how one tries to honor the other after death. The political undertones were second fiddle to the touching story and beautiful construction, making it my favorite film of last year. Unfortunately not all films can use a strong story to thinly veil an underlying theme or moral, sometimes they must wear their politics on their sleeves. Once again I have no qualms with this as I'll see the trailer and decide not to bother. It is a despicable thing that has been done with the new animated children's film Happy Feet. Not only do they advertise it as an ugly-duckling type tale of redemption, but also completely target it to children. I equate this travesty of cinema to Camel Joe pitching smokes to kids; it is truly appalling.Through the first 45 minutes or so I was with this movie. I enjoyed the against all odds yarn, the animation was nice, the music fun and entertaining (not to mention the Moulin Rouge- like use of it to advance the story), and the reigned in absurdity of Robin Williams was hilarious. Sadly, the film took a huge dive to garbage very quickly after. All of a sudden the emperor penguins become an evil cultish Catholic Church banishing their young 'heretic' whose blasphemy has caused a shortage of sustenance. His evil ways have made their God take away their fish and livelihood and he must be excommunicated. I should have seen signs of this when, after deftly allowing us to tell our protagonist apart from the rest by his blue eyes, they grew the penguins up and made his fur stick out completely from the crowd; Mumbles the penguin was a disgrace, and an outsider who decides to use science and fact to prove his superiority over the simple creationists he was raised with. Now I hate the Catholic Church just as much as the next disgruntled Catholic, but come on here. Do little children need to be force-fed an anti-parable about the evils of the Right?The liberals behind this film don't stop at the allegory between penguins and humanity, however, no, they take it even further. Once Mumbles goes on his mission to prove humans are taking the fish and not God, he is eventually captured. Upon awakening, he finds, to his dismay, that he is in a zoo, surrounded by brainwashed penguinsslaves to fish feeding time and multitudes of human watchers that ignore his cries for help for his species back home. My gag-reflex was tested when the filmmakers cut sharply from Mumbles' face to the cityscape where the zoo resides, to Earth, and then to space. Oh for shame, what are we doing to these penguins? Only when a little girl sees his tap-dancing do the humans 'awaken' to the atrocities they are committing with nature and free him to go search for more penguins. Now we have a melding of real live actors with the animation, people traveling to Antarctica to see these wondrous tap-dancing creatures. After a crisis of faith is averted, the humans are tickled by the showmanship of these animals and start dancing themselves. What's worse are the cut scenes shown next of people in board rooms discussing how humanity is destroying this creature's ecosystem and what can we do to stop it? This is a children's film and the creators should be ashamed of themselves.When did America resort to brainwashing its youth and turning a prophet? Maybe it would be accurate to say a long time ago. I understand if you were to bill this as Green Peace sponsored, liberal approved rhetoric and allowed the parents the choice on whether to subject their children to it. Instead we are given the posters and trailers of a cute little penguin tap-dancing while trying to find his heart song. Now all the kids want to go and experience the fun. Well congratulations to the filmmakers, it seems to have worked making Happy Feet the number one movie in America for two weeks. Next time they start picketing a meat factory for herding cattle to their deaths they can take a look in the mirror and see a person who herded young minds into an ambush of political cajoling. Why let our youth grow old and become educated to the issues when we can get them now in elementary school? Have them come home crying, 'are we really killing the penguins Mommy?' (Yes there were many crying kids in my IMAX screening) and learn that they better vote Democrat when they reach voting age because if not then the furry creatures we pay to see at zoos will lose their homes. Happy Feet is a disgrace to cinema and a guerilla tactic by liberal supporters. What kind of world do we live in when our children aren't even safe to watch a cartoon about dancing penguins?",1,37,74,26 November 2006
Slumdog Millionaire," Dreams of so many, on the floor  Slumdog Millionaire
","With this new film, Slumdog Millionaire, the Boyle treats us to a touching love story, backdropped into a world of crime and poverty in Mumbai, India. It is such a simple tale, yet told in gorgeous flashback, peeling back layers when necessary and enhancing the relationships between our lead Jamal and those around him; those on his 'friends and family' plan. Here is a young man from the streets, a boy who witnessed his own mother's murder, living only to be reunited with the one person he truly loves, Latika. His bond to her leads him on an adventurous life full of violence and cruelty, events so harrowing that one would be hard-pressed to forget even the smallest detail about them. This is a great fact for Jamal as it will soon be shown how his life was lived with a destiny to be achieved. When he becomes a contestant on 'Who Wants to be a Millionaire', it's as though the questions were written especially for him.Accused of cheating and arrested by the police, (talk about rights violations, at least we have rights in America), he is tortured to discover how he was able to trick the system. Only when nothing yields results does the Inspector, (the great Irfan Khan), decide to hear Jamal out and find the truth. What transpires is the film we have come to watcha story told from a police chair, one of how the rough and tumble life of a slumdog gave him the exact right experiences to keep going towards a purse of twenty million rupees. Boyle, never one to go conventional, cuts between flashbacks of childhood, (the actual event being remembered), with Jamal in the hotseat on television, thinking of his past tragedies to continue the game as long as he can, in hopes that his love is watching, wherever she may be. With gorgeous cuts at the startflashes of memories jumbled together as he is submerged in water or electrocutedthe structured chaos soon calms down to a normal pathway of three converging timelines: childhood, the previous night's game show, and the present incarceration. We are shown exactly what we need at exactly the right time. The film couldn't have been shot any other way and be nearly as successful as it is.It all began in the slums with Jamal and his brother Salim. The two were inseparable no matter how much the older sibling would wreck the younger's joy for his own laughter. They always believed in each other, even though they took diverging paths in life, the bond was never broken. These two Musketeers did what they needed to survive, looking out for one another and also for their surrogate third 'brother' Lakita. Separated often, the three had a knack for finding one another through the years, until an event risks shattering any love between the brothers  an event that proves crucial to what characters do once the final trivia question is asked. Only when the bottom drops and one sees the monster they have become can he finally try to make amends. It's a journey through time that proves how strong love is. Money is meaningless unless there is a life to live spending it. Who knows, if you live your life correctly, without regret, good things can happen. One doesn't necessarily need to seek fortune in order to earn it and that fortune doesn't always have to be monetary.Boyle orchestrates it all with a steady hand, creating stunning visuals with composition, editing, (especially the numerous chase scenes on foot), and tempo changes; adding mood with a stellar soundtrack, (I'm enjoying it as I write); and allowing his actors to breathe free and give some powerfully natural performances. You have to give all those involved credit, for controlling three different actors as each of our three leads, all of which stay true to each other, never allowing you to believe they aren't the same person just at different stages of their lives. Straight across the board, Jamal, Salim, and Latika are three-dimensional people trying to survive, no matter what they must do. I really enjoyed the youngest Salim, Azharuddin Mohammed Ismail, with his infectious and mischievous smile when he tricks his brother, and also the middle incarnation by Ashutosh Lobo Gajiwala, a boy at the crossroads of a path towards salvation or a descent ending with an eternity in the slum. Freida Pinto's oldest Latika is wonderful as the troubled girl knowing only the kindness of one man, a man that she pushes away in fear of his death should they run away. However, it is Dev Patel's Jamal that steals the show. With his blank stare and unceasing drive to find his love, Patel pushes on through it all. Severing ties and mending others to get closer to his dream, this young man never strays from his quest and you can see the wheels turning behind his eyes, calculating his next step.A tale of destiny and striving to be good, Slumdog Millionaire is an uplifting parable showing how karma works. Everything happens for a reason, nothing is left to chance. Perhaps it is all written, but that doesn't make the journey any tougher to endure. Jamal could have, understandably, given up at many times in his life, but his drive would not allow him that convenience. Conquering all odds, coming from the streets, to the point he didn't even know Ghandi's face was on his own country's currency, Jamal gets the chance at a fortune and an opportunity to finally be free. I seriously found myself hoping he'd get the final question correct; it engrossed me that much. You'll have to watch yourself to find out.",10,1,3,9 December 2008
The Breakfast Club," You'll get the horns  The Breakfast Club
","It may not be the funniest film that John Hughes crafted, but The Breakfast Club is the one that I think made the biggest impression on me. Revisiting it—so many years after its creation, as well as many since I last sat down to watch its entirety—gave me an interesting experience. How the three friends with me had never seen it is beyond me, but that fact caused something I never expected. Each moment of weight, those moments when the kids explain the pressures of each high school 'social class' and why they are spending their Saturday in detention, still hit me as they did when I first watched it. However, my friends just laughed straight through, seeing the cheesiness and the way Andrew's 'buns-taping' incident played out in a homosexual-like nature, amongst other reasons. As a result, I began to wonder if the film only holds up to me because I had seen it when I was younger; it holds a place in my memory and heart. Maybe watching it for the first time today just can never have the same impact; it's time capsule sensibilities just too much for the contemporary young adult to relate to. Either way, I could never discount its poignancy or subtle humor and I'm sure it will still be my favorite Hughes film when I'm fifty.John Hughes is an enigma. The decade from 1980-1990 was as good as you can have in Hollywood for him. With films like Uncle Buck, Planes, Trains and Automobiles, and Vacation, this guy was the end all be all for comedy. After Home Alone, though, his golden touch disappeared and he's never been able to rekindle that magic. It's gotten so bad that he's resorted to a penname, giving his writing credit for Drillbit Taylor to a fictional Edmond Dantes, (Dumas is rolling in his grave with that one). But those early films are classics. I completely understand my friends' experience of The Breakfast Club, I could see those homoerotic connections and the idiocy of some lines and events, but I couldn't bring myself to laugh at them. If they weren't there, I might not have noticed at all, that is how high an affinity I have of the movie. Until someone points out the shortcomings, (if they even are, I mean this is almost 25 years old), I see it only as how it is.What really wowed me upon watching again was how effective this film is with just dialogue. Besides a couple journeys outside in the halls or Dick Vernon's escapades, the entire film takes place in the library, much of which includes the five stars sitting on the floor. When Estevez tells his story, it is made even more impressive by the fact that it was a single take. The camera moves horizontally as he speaks, allowing those in the foreground and desk legs to obstruct your view until the pan moves further. Yet he continues his monologue, voice breaking and tears streaking  it really is a powerful scene. Every kid that goes to high school experiences the trauma and drama and messed up social structures created, every kid can see a little bit of themselves in one, if not all, of the group. Call them clichés, call them stereotypes—these five kids are you and I.I think we should also acknowledge the accomplishment of Hughes with this film, more than others, and what it has done to Hollywood. Many of his successes came with buddy comedies or family oriented vacations, all of which had multiple environments and bigger budgets. However, The Breakfast Club was so much more with so much less. Without this film becoming a hit based on dialogue and character interaction, we may never have seen the likes of Kevin Smith's Clerks, (a self-proclaimed fan who references Hughes often in his films), or the independent insurgence that was a result. This was one of the films that showed people a smartly told story that is relevant to its audience could be better than one in the moneymaking system. You could have young upstarts like the 'Brat Pack' raking in the money. Estevez, Anthony Michael Hall, and Molly Ringwald got their start here along with other 80s fare. You could argue that Judd Nelson's peak was as John Bender, that scared criminally inclined kid acting out on the weak and naïve to have some semblance of power and worth, something all but absent in his home life. And my favorite, Ally Sheedy, shows that being an individual—being yourself—is all that matters. Everyone here caters to their friends and their clique except for her. She transcends it all and becomes an island to herself. By far the shining light of the film in what she represents, I am still almost hurt that she lets Ringwald 'doll' her up at the end. She is so much cuter when disheveled.I can't not mention Paul Gleason's stellar schoolteacher, who has seen the kids get cockier and himself more serious, or John Kapelos' Carl, the 'Man of the Year' turned janitor. They just go to show how well fleshed out every character is here. Sure they all embody those aspects we single out, distilled into one host for the purposes of showing us a projection of high school, but I don't care. There is just something about The Breakfast Club that can never be changed in my eyes, no matter how much I understand new viewers' trepidations on its quality. A nostalgia pick for sure, I'll still recommend it to everyone I meet. If they can't get past the datedness, it's their loss.",9,0,0,3 April 2009
The Wedding Singer," Kiss my gritsThe Wedding Singer
","No matter how big an Adam Sandler fan I am, I will admit that most of his films are crap. I don't mean the three 'serious' movies he's done, as I have liked or loved all of them, I am talking about the comedies he helps produce. After hitting the ball out of the park first time out with Billy Madison, one of my favorite stupid comedies ever, he has been hit or miss, with a lot of misses. Luckily most often than not, he follows a letdown with a winner. I'm not saying Happy Gilmore was a letdown per se, but it is not one of my favorites of his. However, right after came the 80's pop culture referencing The Wedding Singer. While not the funniest of his films, it balances the sentimentality, the heart, and the laughs better than any of his work. I could truly watch this movie anytime it is on TV; it never gets old.The story is not an original masterpiece as we have Sandler's character falling for a girl who is engaged to a jerk/adulterer. We all know how it will end up, so it is the exposition and the plot progression that needs to work in order to sell us what will ultimately happen. This one hits all its marks flawlessly. Between the crazy scenarios that our main characters end up intertwining themselves in, to the fantastic soundtrack, to the clothing and technological advances of the decade being sprinkled throughout, to the genuinely priceless singing scenes, it all works. The opening wedding helps start everything out on the right foot with a great cover song, a cameo by Steve Buscemi which is hysterical, an introduction to all our main players and where they are in their lives, and many big laughs. Counter this with Sandler's next gig, while depressed beyond belief, and you have two polar opposite situations that deliver the goods with equal success.All the performances work and it is the cameos that sometimes overshadow the leads. Adam Sandler is probably at his best here as far as comedic roles. Unlike his previous efforts, portraying dimwitted goons that speak like they are mentality deficient, here he shows some nuance as a character with fully fleshed out motives. His Robbie Hart is a guy that people can relate to; a nice guy trying to show that sometimes even they can finish first. Drew Barrymore is the weak link as usual. She is brimming with happiness and possesses a cheery disposition, but she just isn't a terribly good actress. For a role like this she is not too bad, especially in parts where she is allowed to just go with it. When Barrymore and Sandler are getting price quotes for wedding photos and pretend to be brother and sister, there is a real moment that almost makes her seem natural. Unfortunately, most times she just looks like she is trying to act and therefore coming off as unnatural and awkward.As said before though, it's the cameos that steal this film. The aforementioned Buscemi is top-notch as usual in Sandler-fare, Jon Lovitzwho generally annoys meis very funny, Billy Idol is classic, Christine Taylor effective, and Allen Covert shows why Sandler puts him in almost all his films. I don't quite know how these two met, but it seems that they are pretty good friends and it comes across on screen. He is the confidant, the ying to his yang, the comic relief, and the voice of reason at some point during the film. It is interesting that he has never had this prominent of a role in a Sandler-vehicle since, because he does a great job with this one.",7,0,1,15 July 2007
The Pursuit of Happyness," He must have had on some really nice pantsThe Pursuit of Happiness
","The genre of uplifting, against all odds type stories is probably the second most common behind the against all odds sports tale. Every once in awhile one will come out that just blows the other away, however, they are mostly all just carbon copies of each other. These types of films have a built in formula of acts to keep the audience emotionally attached. You see the happiness taken away, you see the trials and tribulations and failures along the way, and finally you see your protagonist redeemed. I hoped that The Pursuit of Happiness would strive above these preconceptions and become something more than its type. Unfortunately, besides the heartbreaking performances from Will and Jaden Smith, this film really just recycles all the genres' attributes and fills in the blanks with the details of Chris Gardner's life.Gardner is a very intelligent and ambitious man. He saw an opportunity to make some money for his wife and son, but didn't see the results of his investing in machines, that although state-of-the-art, were luxuries his clientele didn't see benefits in paying for. With all his money tied up in his machines, he never had the chance to find a career, as he needed to sell his products just to recoup the finances he used to pay for them. Finally, a job opportunity arises that would lend itself greatly to his high aptitude of mathematics. He sees a chance to make a living for his family so that they will no longer have to live paycheck to paycheck, but the decision itself would throw his world upside down. His wife can't handle taking another chance at something that may ultimately fail and leaves him, Gardner finds his internship is full-time without pay, the IRS is after them for back taxes, and they find themselves on the street without anyplace to live. The one thing that could turn his life around comes at the price of having just a one in twenty chance at getting out of the worst squalor his life has seen. Homeless and broke, he has no other choice.I don't know if it was the knowledge of this type of movie, that everything will work out, or the fact that our hero does many unsavory things along his journey, but I just couldn't quite be taken over by the story. You see his life falling apart all around him, but you know that everything will turn out right; you just wait and see to find out how. Sure that journey is a good ride and interesting to watch, it just doesn't resonate as much when you know that no matter how bad it gets, it won't get THAT bad. Unfortunately that fact is inherent in all these types of films, and you need something else to invest in. With Happiness, that something else are the wonderful performances. All the supporting players are fantastic, especially small roles like that of Kevin West's time machine obsessed crazy, and Thandie Newton's heartbreaking wife. Newton is just made up of pain and sorrow throughout, trying her best to believe in her husband. The stress is too much, and she is wonderful at showing every moment of hardship. Although you don't like the way she leaves, you have to almost understand her reasons. Also, young Jaden Smith is a natural on screen. Sure that could be a result of being so young and just reacting rather than acting, (especially having his real father to play off of), but either way it is a brilliant job. His innocence and lack of complete knowledge in what is happening to his life is some emotionally wrenching stuff. The real leader of the film, though, is Will Smith. He has been a fantastic actor for many years, and it is a joy to see him finally play a role, which allows him to show his skill. Sure we all love the action/comedy fare, but not since Ali have we seen what a professional he is. This is probably the best performance of his career thus far that I've seen and he deserves all the accolades being thrown his way. No matter how well he did though, I believe the character itself leaves a bit to be desired. In order to get where he is, he does a lot of lying, some stealing, (I mean he stays at these places until they throw him out; they will never see any money for the months they trusted him in), and some harsh reacting to characters he interacts with. For every moment Gardner really excels and shows the natural charisma and skill, which will land him a career, there is an instance that you look and feel he could have handled it much differently and better. There is also a lot of luck involved along the way, as every machine he loses miraculously is found, to the point he can run after someone and take it back to stay afloat financially for one more day. I wonder how much of the contrived moments necessary to keep him alive actually happened to the real Chris Gardner and how many were created for the story to advance cinematically.",7,0,0,13 January 2007
The Proposal," The witch is on her broom  The Proposal
","It is safe to say, my man-crush on Ryan Reynolds has remained intact after watching his new film The Proposal. It could have gotten ugly being a vehicle for Sandra Bullock, (Reynolds is in fact the 'romantic interest'), directed by Anne Fletcher, the woman behind the occasionally entertaining 27 Dresses. Would I have enjoyed myself as much as I did if Reynolds—a Canadian playing an American, opposite an American playing a Canadian—was not there? Probably not. That is what his sarcastic humor does for the romantic comedy, it makes it worth the time; he seriously makes this movie. But I don't want to disregard everything in the film, because I actually thought Bullock was good as the tough as nails, cutthroat boss. In fact, for an actress I don't generally enjoy, the last two I've seen including her have been surprisingly good. Yes, I enjoyed The Lake House.Peter Chiarelli's script is by no means original at all. Besides making it the woman that needs a sham marriage to stay in the country instead of the man, what we have here is a premise devoid of creativity. However, all these films contain that crutch; it's nothing new. One doesn't go to a date movie like this for intelligent storytelling, it's about being entertained for a couple hours, watching the antics of love do their worst on screen. And, frankly, The Proposal does exactly that. I laughed a lot during the course of this Alaskan adventure, knowing the outcome, but genuinely interested to see the path that would lead to it. This high-powered book-publishing editor-in-chief is at risk of losing her job for a whole year if she is deported to Canada. None of her employees would be crushed from this fact, as they are completely scared of her, computer messaging each other warnings when she is moving around the office.While they all would probably be better off emotionally, alleviated of a lot of stress, it is her assistant that would lose the most if she were sent away. Being her right-hand man, despite loathing her as well, he'd be the first to be fired in order to rid the office of anything Margaret Tate. Therefore, when confronted with the proposal of marriage, he decides to risk jail in order to blackmail his 'bride-to-be' into giving him a promotion to editor and the respect he knows he deserves and thinks she does as well. The reason this film is as funny as it is? Mainly because Reynolds' Andrew Paxton eventually realizes he has the upper hand, his fake doting charm is washed away and the biting, cruel longing for payback comes to the surface as it is his turn to make Margaret's life a living hell. Satan's mistress no longer holds the control in their relationship, as he is the only chance she has of keeping her job.So, it becomes a test of each person's mettle. He has to lie to his parents and Gammy, (it's her 90th birthday), about being in love with the woman he abhors most in this world, and she must pretend to not be the cold, frigid, soulless person she is. The course of events in the small Alaskan town—virtually owned by the Paxton's—becomes the true driving force of the film. The actual wedding and immigration fraud is in fact only a premise to splice together numerous comedic skits and opportunity for both Reynolds and Bullock to verbally spar. The quick wit is fun, especially in moments like the telling of how Andrew proposed. It is an ad-libbed discourse told by the back and forth of both New Yorkers, doing their best to make the other seem weak and powerless.Besides the scene stealing performance from Reynolds, (don't get me wrong, he won't be nominated for any Oscars here, but he does what he is supposed to and makes this thing worth watching), and the solid job from Bullock, you can't leave this film without a smile forming when thinking back to both Betty White and Oscar Nuñez. These two are hysterical. White is great as Gammy, never afraid to speak her mind or make the guest uncomfortable. Without shame, she is at her best opposite Bullock, definitely having a fun time with the role. She is also a main catalyst in the second of two 'musical numbers,' getting her soon-to-be granddaughter to chant and dance around an indigenous fire ceremony. That chanting becomes a wonderful rendition of 'Get Low' by Lil Jon. But you can't forget the brilliant falsetto from Reynolds doing Rob Base & DJ E-Z Rock's 'It Takes Two'. The scene begs you to recall 27 Dresses' best scene of 'Benny and the Jets'. Fletcher seems to like her sing-a-longs.And, of course, there's Nuñez. His first appearance made me laugh due to his comical Spanish accent. Seeing him as the straight man, (no joke intended), opposite the crazies in 'The Office,' gives you a certain typecast idea of what he'll be doing. Throw all those preconceptions out the window, though, because he is definitely not Oscar from television. No, he is Sitka's resident butler, country store manager, and exotic dancer amongst other occupations. The Spanish lisp gets funnier as the film goes on and his antics more absurd. It is supporting roles like his that prove the effectiveness of the film, making it more about the audience laughing and less about what may happen to Reynolds and Bullock. Sit back and enjoy a good time, because The Proposal has the potential of being a lasting hit at the box office, especially as reverse programming to summer blockbusters like Transformers 2. So girls, if your man drags you to see robotic carnage, don't feel bad returning the favor with this little gem. He may actually enjoy it, although he'll never tell you so.",7,0,3,27 June 2009
Valkyrie," Long live sacred Germany  Valkyrie
","Bryan Singer returns to a world that isn't inhabited with superheroes, joining an old friend in screenwriter Christopher McQuarrie, a partnership that last resulted in The Usual Suspects. The question then becomes whether lightning can strike twice and if Tom Cruise's thoughts that it would, by producing it as his second feature as head of United Artists, could be correct. With Valkyrie, a 'based on true events' tale of high Nazi officials with enough guts to risk their lives to stop Adolf Hitler's reign of terror and his sullying of Germany's good name, those questions will be answered. If I were to be bold enough to weigh in with my opinion I'd say all those involved should feel proud of their work. I won't say lightning struck again because, honestly, I was never that impressed by The Usual Suspects, it's good, but without the ending it wouldn't necessarily even approach great. Much are my thoughts on this historical wartime opusit tells a very intriguing story with the right amounts of action, espionage, and heroism, however, I don't see it as anything spectacular. It's a very well done film and it can be applauded for that fact.Valkyrie was set up to be the studio's tent-pole attraction, announcing the return of a movie-house. Unfortunately, after being pushed back a complete year, the release has become somewhat lackluster, a huge albatross of whether the backers didn't feel it would succeed then making us wonder if it will now. With some big names attached behind and in front of the camera, many believed this would be a contender for end of year awards. I don't think that will be the case. Solid yet unspectacular creates a piece that is worth seeing and recommending, but not an award-winning masterpiece. Singer does do a lot right, though, hopefully showing that he can branch out and distance himself from X-Men and Superman Returns to bring the humanity and character evolution that worked so well with his two mutant stories into a world grounded in reality.At the end of the day, this film is made to showcase the actors while trying to educate the public about these superheroes in their own way, some heroics from a country and time that saw only murder and hatred. While this fact is what I enjoyed about it, it is also what may cause some of its lackluster sheen. Knowing, (I hope I'm ruining nothing here and people realize that Hitler committed suicide when the Allies surrounded Berlin), that the attempt to kill and overthrow the Nazi regime fails, makes the first half exposition drag. One wants to see how the plan falls apart, not how it was shaped and put into motion. Let me correct myself, you do want to know these details, how these men banded together, how they duped Der Führer, it's just the anticipation to watch the plan go into effect that dulls the factual history from being as interesting as it should be. Once the day finally arrives to prove their worth, the tension and pace tighten up and drive steadily to the end, keeping you riveted as each step advances.I won't go into detail about the plans, which are the beauty of the operation; the ideas and execution of them are what keeps your interest. It is a pretty airtight mission, but as General Beck states, it's a military operation, they never go right. No one can ever anticipate what might happenvenue changes, a person's kindness to help carry something, the brief second-guessing of a man sacrificing precious seconds. One can never practice anything to perfection because life just isn't that exact. But therein lies the heart of this story, that there are people who dare to stand against the norm to fight for what is right. Despite their oath to Hitler, these men and women put their feet down and risk it all for the citizens, for their country. It was never about them, it was always about Germany.The one thing I feared was the fact that everyone spoke with their natural accents, no one made anyone attempt a horrid German tongue to possibly distract and distance us from the reality. While there is something to be said about realism, if handled right, there can be exceptions. Bryan Singer deftly maneuvers his way into the English translation by beginning in German and slowing superimposing our language atop the vocal track. It's a subtle trick that helps make us believe we have been brought into a state of translation; the characters are speaking German yet we can understand them. This also helps in allowing the actors to give it their all, without the clunky self-consciousness that follows speaking out of one's native speech patterns. I believe Tom Cruise does a wonderfully solid job as von Stauffenberg and the rest of the cast follows suit. The two that impressed me most, however, were Christian Berkel as von Quirnheim and Bill Nighy's Olbricht. Nighy exudes the inner conflict and struggle of humanity throughout the film, questioning everything and wanting to be absolutely sure of each step. When the time was right, though, he was able to compose himself and do his job, because deep down he knew he was doing what he believed in.Kudos to all involved for making this story and opening my eyes to it, as I'm sure it will for many others too. Everyone brings their A-game, it's all just too much a non-fiction film for me, stating the facts without surprise, lecturing rather than digging into our souls and touching us. The ending is magnificent, don't get me wrong, it shows the strength of character these 'traitors' had and it instills a legacy of heroism that they deserve. The journey to that point may be a little too paint-by-numbers for my liking.",8,12,24,18 December 2008
Up in the Air," I'm like my mother, I stereotype—it's faster  Up in the Air
","Based on the novel by Walter Kirn, George Clooney stars as corporate downsizing expert Ryan Bingham, who is hired to help ease the transition of long-term employees to the unemployment line across the country. Taking his job very seriously and loving the 290 days away from home—the only problem with that is the 70 days at home in his empty apartment—his world gets turned upside-down when a young upstart in the company threatens to ground the company to fire people via the internet. Not standing for a change in his life, nor the chance for his life goal of total airline miles to end, ('Let's just say I have a number and I haven't hit it yet'), he goes on a mission to prove how personal his job is and how key a face to face meeting can be to talk down an emotionally unstable person and really do the victim a service in an otherwise horrible moment in his life. Along the way, he and the recent college grad, of which the boss loves due to her budget slashing game-changing idea, Natalie, played by Anna Kendrick, both find out what has been lacking in their lives and how to become better people, opening up to love, heartbreak, and the need to grow up.Clooney's Bingham is the loner businessman whose only relationships exist from random meetings with attractive females at the multiple airports he frequents. His wallet of plastic has become his lifeblood—credit cards from airlines that accumulate his mileage, hotel status perk cards that let him cut the disgruntled travelers and go straight to the front, and numerous room keys that never seem to be thrown out, causing him to always use more than one before finally opening his hotel suite's door. Detached from his family for years as the brother that exists but cannot be counted on for anything, he contemplates whether he should, or really wants to, attend his sister's wedding—the little girl of the family and someone he should have been involved with after the passing of their father. A series of style cramping incidents for him begins with a phone call from his other sister and the request to take a cardboard cutout of the happy couple, (Melanie Lynskey and Danny McBride, in a role that might actually show some nuance for a guy that usually flies by the cuff), and photograph it in front of famous places he travels to for work 'like that French gnome movie,'—I love the Amélie reference. Then comes the threat of being taken out of the air, his home for decades, in order to impersonally let go more people more efficiently; the challenge of taking Natalie on his next schedule of jobs to prove to her why the new system won't work; and the addition of a love interest in Vera Farmiga's Alex, a woman who describes herself to him with 'just think of me as you with a vagina'—one of many great lines.There is a lot of subtlety and intricate weaving of plot lines throughout the story, details and sequences that need to be seen fresh to get the full benefit of the film. What you might initially think is a witty comedy about a jerk of a guy who not only thinks he's better than everyone else, but actually is, that either finds the error of his ways or gets dropped down a peg or two, eventually becomes a tale chock full of heart and emotion. The real success story of the film is a revelatory performance from Clooney who really knocks this on out of the park. He always showed the charisma and chops to play confident and successful, but here is allowed to also branch out and express the pent-up frustration that comes with isolated loneliness, the passion one can have for a job that seems horrible, yet, when treated carefully, is a job to take seriously, and the compassion for humanity on the whole, softening enough to realize that there are people around him that need help besides his laid off strangers, help that only he can provide. The evolution he undertakes is really pretty amazing and I credit Kirn, Reitman, and Clooney for pulling it off with grace and laughter.Every single actor is unforgettable—even the bit parts like Zach Galifianakis and especially J.K. Simmons as two corporate employees who's jobs have been eliminated. Jason Bateman is hilarious as Clooney's smug boss, fully embodying the take no crap nonchalance he made famous in 'Arrested Development'; Farmiga is gorgeous and competent to be able to go toe-to-toe with Clooney in the detachment and power-hungry attitude of flying in style for half a year or more; and, if George's reinvention of character is revelatory, then Kendrick's naïve Natalie is masterful. This girl was top in her class, able to get a job in her field wherever her heart desired, yet settled for this firm specializing in firing people so as to not dirty the workers' real superior's hands. Young and confused about life in the big world of adulthood—set on a plan for marriage and children to occur as though set times on a clock—her eyes are opened to the intimacy and fragility with which a person's mental state can be affected by mere words. When you put them all together, Up in the Air resonates on so many levels; deserving of any praise and accolades to be bestowed upon it. Hilariously funny every second of the way, it is still unafraid to dig into the dark moments of life and treat them with respect and relevancy, going places you wouldn't think it would have the guts to go. You really can't say too much about the film, a top ten of the year entry for sure. Reitman proving to be a force to reckon with and Clooney that he just keeps getting better with age.",9,273,388,19 September 2009
Atonement," No rhymes and no embellishmentsAtonement
","Ladies and gentlemen, a hand for director Joe Wright; he has crafted a masterpiece. With resemblances to films like Cold Mountain and A Very Long Engagement, Atonement is just so much more. Visually stunning, intellectually stimulating, and forever heartbreaking, Wright has made a movie like no other this year. Sure I have seen 'perfect' films this year, for lack of a better word, but even Gone Baby Gone winds up far down the list when compared to all 10/10 films I've seen and given that mark to. This is the first film all year that I can truly say is something I will buy and share with everyone I know. I can only imagine how much greater Ian McEwan's novel upon which this is based can be. From the start right on until the end, we are shown a glimpse into the lives of the Tallis family and those surrounding them. It is a time of social status and proper manners, an era led along by its rules and prejudices. For a young girltoo naïve and innocent to fully grasp what it is she seesthat world is a very dangerous playground.The backbone of the tale lies in the fact that everyone sees events and history through their own eyes. What is the truth anyway? Unless you are privy to every second of an occurrence, from its cause to its effect, you can never really comprehend if that which you saw was real, and even then it is a very fine line to walk. Atonement is at all times playing with this notion, showing us sequences from the eyes of the viewer and than again through those of the participants. Whereas the two lovers are afraid to let slip their social faux-pas of a relationship outside of classes, the accuser is so set in the warped truth she believes that to think about the situation objectively is not at the front of her mind.It is amazing how one moment in time can so utterly devastate the lives of all involved. The consequences of which can never be imagined until years later after they have already occurred. Between Robbie having to go to jail and than join the army in WWII for a crime he did not commit, (it is tough to watch his return to the house with the two young twins that he had been out trying to find, totally oblivious to the crime that transpired while he was gone), and his love Cecilia Tallis losing the one thing she didn't know she even had until a couple hours before, it is tough to believe the orchestrator of all that sorrow would have it even worse. Cecilia's sister Briony did what she thought was right, led into a lie by the victim herself, and she would have to live with that regret and guilt for the rest of her life, without any means to vindicate herself or make amends. I don't even know if what she did could honestly ever be forgiven; her sheltered aristocratic upbringing and wild storytelling imagination can be held accountable. The times are at fault too for holding the weak words of a 13-year-old as fact against an inferior servant boy, no matter how much a part of the family he had become or how educated he was.Despite all the support it is the lead characters that carry this film. Keira Knightley is amazing as Cecilia, growing out of her groomed lifestyle to be with the man she knows she has always loved. The pain she must express and the hurt her love causes herself is believable at every turn. I will admit to never seeing all the hype with her as an actress, but that opinion has totally been wiped away. As for Robbie, the man at the heart of it all, James McAvoy has really come into his own. Sure he has been great in previous work, even stealing scenes from Oscar winner Forest Whitaker in The Last King of Scotland, but it is his portrayal here that shows his true worth. Knowing his place in society, he accepts his fate. Only when he finds out a few years later that his love was not a tenuous one is he allowed to breakdown and fight to survive. The scene where he meets Briony again many years after that fateful night is powerful to experience as emotions run high and wild. All three actors in that scene deliver.Not to be overshadowed, director Joe Wright deserves a lot of praise and credit too. His handling of the material is impeccable and the end result glorious to behold. From the editing style, showing us all viewpoints of every situation, to the sweeping crane shots following characters, to the brilliant performances he gets out of all involved, Wright has a steady hand and complete control. The film would be a top ten candidate as a result of just two sequences, even if the rest were trash. When the war hits Briony's hospital, the montage of carnage, grief, and compassion is overwhelming, however, it is the arrival of Robbie and his two friends at Dunkirk that takes the prize. This elaborate long take is absolutely astonishing. It begins with their arguing to a superior about getting back home, going on to the slaughter of horses and automobiles, a group of men singing, some men on an amusement park ride, losing the three men to eventually join up with them again as they rejoin each other at the bar across the way, ending on an all encompassing view of the chaos on the beach. Stunning to behold, that scene sums up the whole film with its artistry and attention to detail. Complete with a startling revelation at its conclusion, I can't think of a better word than perfect for when I am ever asked what I thought of the film.",10,5,8,28 December 2007
Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby," Shake and BakeTalladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby
","If Talladega Nights did anything for me, it confirmed my previous bias that racecar driving is boring to watch. While filled with some great, random one-liners, and some really good performances, Ricky Bobby's ballad crawls along at a sluggish pace. What's weird about this outlook is that the slowest talking character, played hilariously by Sasha Baron Cohen, was actually a part that moved the scenes forward. It was flashy, fast-talking, yet ultimately uninteresting.I will admit to not being much of a Will Ferrell fan. I find his comedy loud and obnoxious, used correctly very rarely. He is usually good in ensemble pieces where he is not the star, Old School for instance, while using one-note performances extended way beyond their limits in his star vehicles like Anchorman, which I hated besides a nice absurdist back street brawl, and the film being discussed here. Ferrell's shtick seems to always go too long; he seems to revel in killing his jokes, which becomes even more annoying when everyone in America starts to say his lines verbatim in casual conversation. The film had some parts that really worked, however, mostly when it was at its most absurd. There was a subversive sense of comical surrealism at moments that succeeded; they showed that everyone was taking him/ herself with naught a shred of seriousness. Most of the slow parts, really the unsuccessful ones, are when we are suddenly spoon-fed sentimentality and new-found moral fiber that is so out of character, one wishes it was gone so as to see more funny instances. The film worked as a comedy and died quickly when it decided to take itself way too seriously.There were some real shining moments, however. John C. Reilly is amazing. He has always played the low-key, slightly naïve, schlub well, and here he takes low-IQ to another level. The comic timing and delivery is impeccable and I hope that he sticks to these character roles that suit his abilities perfectly rather then try his hand at superstardom as most other 'sidekicks' try and fail to do. One thing that he has going for him is that he is established already, (used brilliantly by autuers such as Paul Thomas Anderson), and won't fall prey to any lucrative deals for crap scripts. Gary Cole is spectacular as Ferrell's father. The sleazy, white-trash nature he brings is true to the character and provides most of the good laughs. Sasha Baron Cohen was also a revelation to me. I have not seen his Da Ali G Show, so I know very little about him, except for the very funny trailer for his movie starring the titular alter- ego Borat. By being very deliberate and always in character throughout, he has created a working caricature. The accent and effeminate, European tendencies are a great contrast to the boorish Bobby. Most other actors are ineffectively used, mostly because these films need to cram in as many cameos as possible, throwing in totally useless cut scenes that are so random they are more distracting than funny. Amy Adams is involved in possibly the best scene of the movie towards the end in a bar with Ferrell. She delivers a great monologue and Ferrell's vocal reactions after are priceless. Unfortunately she was abused earlier in the film, just being shot silent with mouth open, looking as though her talent would totally be wasted.In the end, the randomness and short bursts of real good comedy couldn't save the film. Its sluggish pace is definitely not helped by its infinite number of product placements at all. I mean, come on, when did Hollywood need to whore itself out that much? I see where some reviewers have a point saying it's a commentary on the plethora of advertising in the Nascar world, but I don't give the filmmakers that much credit. It was a low budget comedy that needed money to clear its licensing fees and car wrecks. I will admit that product placement caused the best laugh of the film; just watch for Applebees during the final race and prepare for absurdity at its best. Unfortunately we aren't treated with enough moments like that, where the creators trust the audience to go for the ride and laugh while the movie laughs at itself. Instead we get more moments where everything is spelled out for us. For instance, a great moment of hilarity when we arrive at Cohen's character's mansion and see Mos Def and Elvis Costello. The joke is priceless that they, for what possible reason, could be there. It's a real shame that Ferrell needs to bring attention to them, for no other reason than to ruin the inside joke for those who actually recognized the singers. Remember to stay and watch the few outtakes during the start of the end credits. At least reward yourself for sitting through the duration for some good, unorchestrated laughs.",4,1,4,6 August 2006
Semi-Pro," Softest hands in the worldSemi-Pro
","Will Ferrell has done it again. He got my butt in the seat based off a funny trailer and funnier spoof premise despite the fact I knew I would end up hating the film. Yes, I did not like it much at all. Probably more entertaining than its predecessors, I found myself laughing big at more scenes, rather than just laughs in one or two sequences. I credit this fact to it not trying to be a movie, but instead relying on its strung together skits as just that. Sure it is all loosely tied together for somewhat of an arc in the absurd fantasy world that the Flint Tropics would ever have a shot at becoming an NBA team, but for its own good, Semi-Pro never took itself seriously and I was able to enjoy that fact even though I would have no real interest in ever seeing it again.Barely making the 90 minutes mark, (if it does at all), this is a very short film. I would actually say that is a compliment because the jokes don't have quite the breathing room to get as stale as they could have easily become. What the length does detract from is the screen time of the multitude of side characters. When a joke prop played by Jackie Earle Haley, (the absolute best thing in this film), gets more face time than a tried and true actress like Maura Tierney, you know no one is going to get ample minutes to work with. Tierney is the romantic love interest here, usually that role would be given second billing, but the funny thing here is that she is the love interest for the right-hand man, not the star. Ferrell's Jackie Moon doesn't need a love interest because he is already too in love with himself.I do need to applaud Ferrell for not hijacking this as he customarily does. Yes he is on screen for almost 100% of the movie, but he allows those around him to run free and enhance rather than just be fodder for his own loud, obnoxious shenanigans. Some of the set pieces are perfect for the whole group to really shine at his expense, a very welcome change to the horrid string of 'everyman' bio-spoofs he has been churning out. Scenes like at the poker table, (Jive Turkey); the during commercial brawl on the court, (a priceless ending when they come back on air); and in full Broadway/Sesame Street costumes during a pivotal scene of a power shift, (when they all try to hide from what they are saying by covering their faces with giant foam hands you realize the absurdity of the situation was intentional for those expressions to payoff as funny), really stick out and bring enough laughs to overcome their randomness.We are still given the requisite moments of emotion as though what these players are going through is real life. When they make decisions for the better of the team instead of their own individual self, you think to yourself that a tear might come to your eye due to the excruciating pain of sitting through those moments. I know you need some weight in order to invest in the story, but really I just came to laugh; make me laugh and don't try to be like you're a serious film. They also rely on skits that have been done better before in previous comedies like Andrew Daly and the great Will Arnett doing their best impersonations of the Dodgeball commentators. You can't help think of that superior film and the fact that this is just a poor facsimile.There is still a lot to enjoy during the mess, however. André Benjamin is great as Clarence 'Coffee' Black. He has the comic chops to do some supporting role damage in the industry, but roles like he has had in 'The Shield' show that he could be doing so much better than this hokey fare. Woody Harrelson does well as the professional coming in to save the dayalthough his character's true payoff is with Rod Corddry being totally excited that his girlfriend was falling for Woody, his sports hero. There are a lot of cameos from 'Daily Show' (Steve Carrell is absent) and 'Upright Citizen Brigade' alums and each brings a smirk at some point.Is it great? Absolutely not. Does it have some big laughs? For sure. Would I recommend it? No. Saying that doesn't mean a thing, though, because if you are a fan of Ferrell's previous work in this 'genre' you will be going anyway. Besides that, I am a self-proclaimed detractor of his starring work, (I do enjoy him in smaller roles and more subdued ones), so no one will listen to my opinion. Either way, for what it's worth, I had more fun with this than his others. Maybe I was just in a better mood or maybe I just didn't take it as serious as the others because, thankfully, it didn't take itself that way either.",4,24,80,26 February 2008
