Hereditary," Completely different
","I am a great fan of horror movies and this one came with a lot of hype. Hype which for the first 20 mins it did not live up to. If you check out some of the reviews as I did before watching, it is either a complete waste of time or the best horror in years. It is neither .but after first 20 mins something happened that you don't see in many if any movies, and after that it becomes very creepy indeed. The performances from the lead actors are truly great and the story is actually quite good , the ending is not a cop out as some reviews say but a logical conclusion. In the end this is a brave film and I commend the director, writers and actors for trying something different.",7,1,2,27 August 2018
