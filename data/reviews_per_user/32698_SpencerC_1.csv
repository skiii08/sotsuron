Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Good, but not the best.
","If you haven't seen this yet, don't expect it to be as great as the other three. It is still a great movie, although they could have lived without Jar Jar. Most of the movie was done well. The special effects were good. The lightsaber battle was really cool.",7,0,0,31 August 1999
