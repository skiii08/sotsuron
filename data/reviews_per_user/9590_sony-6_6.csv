Scarface," It has its good parts..........
","I guess....But this movie is way to long! Al Pacino turns in a great performance (as usual) I hated the chainsaw scene...it was unbelievable....i mean in real life the guy would have just pulled out a gun! Not a chainsaw! That was messed up...Michelle Phieffer was excellent as Elvira. If you want a great movie this isnt it, but if you want an okay movie go w/ this!!!!3/10",Null,0,0,25 August 2000
American Pie," mad PHAT!
","I loved this movie! you could relate with the characters, and the movie ACTUALLY  had good acting. it was very funny, but that's not all it was. it focused on romantic scenes too. there are very few of them, BUT, they made the movie even better. one of the funniest movies i've ever seen. 8/10",Null,0,0,9 July 1999

","this movie RULED! i didnt think it would be that funny, i mean i have seen 'Billy madison' and 'Happy gilmore' but i wasnt sure about this one, then i got it off pay-per-view and laughed my @$$ off! adam sandler is the king of comedy! me and my friend always hang out and watch this and no matter how many times we've seen it, we still laugh like crazy!",Null,0,2,19 June 1999
Scream," Very good Movie follwed by poor sequals!!!!
","This is SUCH a good horror flick w/ a great cast and great acting. One of Wes Cravens best i would have to say. The beggining scene is the best! Drew Barrymore should have gotten a larger part......and YES i know she was offered but still, she shouldve taken up the offer. Anywayz the one character that i really hate is Randy. He is so retarded. My fave character is Stu. 8/10 PEACE!",Null,0,0,17 September 2000
