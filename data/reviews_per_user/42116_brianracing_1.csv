First Man," Love, love, loved this movie!
","I have never left a review on IMDB before or any other website for that matter in relation to a movie I have seen, but felt compelled to do so here especially in view of the amount of negative reviews I have read.
From the moment the movie started I was captivated. I'm not going to talk about cinematography or editing or anything else like that, I'm just going to speak about the way it made me feel.
Dark, moody, gloomy? Yes it had these overtones and why shouldn't it? Can you imagine being this guy with the space program in its infancy, watching rocket after rocket being tested for manned spaceflight keel over, collapse, spin and explode again and again, whilst you watch from the sidelines with a multitude of emotions running through your veins, but needing to keep it together because if you can't then you have no business being an astronaut?
The explosion after a fire that kills astronauts Virgil 'Gus' Grissom and Ed White in their command module during preflight testing no less, would be enough to make most people think again.
This movie allows you to see this whole process through the eyes of the man that might just be the most famous astronaut that ever lived, the first man on the moon. The seats on my local bus look better than the seat he sat in to travel to another body in our solar system, this was danger like you wouldn't believe and this movie captures the reality of that beautifully. There are truly somber moments during the movie where real people have to consider possible outcomes and ponder the consequences of those possible outcomes.
For those that claim the movie was unpatriotic, think again, acts of patriotism are witnessed again and again through the bravery and sacrifice that Armstrong and others like him made for the NASA program. They put it all on the line and then some, do we really need someone to stick a flag in some dirt, is that what the definition of patriotism is?
If your purely looking for an action movie this isn't a movie for you, but if you really want to get close to feeling how he must have felt and actually learn something then its a must!Oh and the soundtrack is amazing!",10,0,1,24 October 2018
