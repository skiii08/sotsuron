It," 'It' review, spoilers free
","I don't have much to say about 'It', because it's a perfect horror masterpiece. From effective jump scares (and i mean it, no other horror movie caused me to jump my chair), to, literally everything! If you are choosing between movies, just go on and buy a ticket to this creepy and beautifully crafted 'ride'. This heart-pounding soundtrack and effective chills WILL hold you on to your chair to the last second of this masterpiece. I only rated this 9/10 because i wanted to sit still with my eyes glued to the screen for much longer.'You'll float too'",9,9,17,16 September 2017
