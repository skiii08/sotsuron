Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Great, but I expected more...
","Star Wars was one of the most awaited films of 1999. There are 22 years between the first movie of the saga and this brand new one. Both of them (and all the Star Wars saga) are fantastic, but because of the new technologies and more director experience (and of course a bigger budget), 'Episode I' was supposed to be equal (or better) than the original 'Episode IV'. But, Is it better? In my opinion, I must say NOT. 'Episode I' does definitely not reach the level of richness that the first Star Wars film has. But, if you take the movie like a beginning of a new trilogy, 'The Phantom Menace' is a brilliant film, full of that romantic atmosphere of the first trilogy.What I've found in the film is the 'emptyness' of the characters. I'm not saying that Ewan McGregor, Liam Neeson, Natalie Portman, Jake Lloyd and the rest are bad actors. I think that in this new production, the special effects have been more worked on than the characters. The reason may be that in the first film, because not having the technology to produce incredible visual effects, Lucas had to focus on the characters: their life, their thoughts, their position in the story... In the 'Episode I' all the story goes too fast, without giving the opportunity to explain clearly what and how the things are.It's like Obi-Wan Kenobi. Alec Guiness did an outstanding job playing as the Jedi. Besides, Ewan McGregor does a great acting, but doesn't shine like the Obi-Wan of the first trilogy. We'll have to wait for the next two films to see how the character evolves.In the other hand, the visual effects are spectacular, and the lightsaber fights are awesome! Of course the most commercial character of the film is Darth Maul, who's got a tremendous ability with his double lightsaber. Don't miss the final battle scene between the Jedis and the Sith.Even though, the film does a great effort to keep alive one of the best movies ever made! Go for the Episode II! 8/10",5,0,1,20 July 2000
E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," The most charming story of friendship of all times
","One of the first movies I remember from my childhood, E.T. is a tender story about an alien and a boy who meet each other and start a great friendship, with a clear message to all humanity: love and comprehension has no barriers.Apart from the message and the story, we must say that Steven Spielberg did a fantastic job directing this film. And E.T. was the film that presented for first time in the screens a little cute 10-year-old angel called Drew Barrymore, who did (in my opinion) the performance of her life up to date.E.T. is one of the films that every mortal should watch.. 9/10",8,1,2,12 October 2000
Minority Report," Spielberg & Cruise: The perfect combination
","I consider myself as a true fan of the 7th art, so I get really excited when a new film comes out. And I become anxious to watch the movie. This happened to me with 'The Fellowship of the Ring', 'Matrix' and a huge list of productions; but with 'Minority Report', it was worse ^_^I heard a few weeks after watching 'A.I.' that Steven Spielberg, the most brilliant director of all time, was going to start a film based on a Philip K. Dick novel ('Blade Runner', 'Ubik') and Tom Cruise would be heading the acting crew. Those were good news, because the audience was a bit disappointed with 'A.I.' and wanted Spielberg to erase the flaws his last production had.'Minority Report' is about a 'real future world'. And I say real because Spielberg has tried to create a 2054 world that seemed real, not sci-fi future. He did lots of documentation to recreate a society that, in my opinion, gets quite close to how will it be in 50 years. The police department has reached a level of accuracy that a new division has been created: the Department of Precrime. Using the Precogs, they are able to arrest murderers before they commit the crime.Everything is perfect until the precogs predicts a murder done by John Anderton (Tom Cruise), detective leading the Precrime department. Then Anderton has to escape from the police and prove his innocence... I can't tell you more if you don't want me to spoil the movie!The plot, the special effects, the rythm, the action... Everything is brilliant and smart at the same time. Some parts should have been cut out from the film, but that's my point of view. But with no doubt, 'Minority Report' is a science-fiction film with an actual plot, about the true liberty about mankind and how much we are bond to the technology.Of course the film has the shadow of 'Blade Runner' above, and you'll surely find similarities between both films. But even 'Minority Report' is a masterpiece, Ridley Scott's film is far better!Anyway, a worth look! 10/10",9,0,0,7 November 2002
Se7en," David Fincher's best film & Best Thriller film
","Six years after seeing the film, 'Se7en' is considered, in my opinion, the best creation of one brilliant director: David Fincher. Starting his career with George Lucas in 'The Return of the Jedi' as camera assistant, now he's one of the most acclaimed film directors in the world.His first worldwide known production was 'Alien3', a sequel of the famous alien saga, the worst of all the saga, however. Then, in 1995, 'Se7en' was out, and became a total success.The film is a creepy, thriller production with a crew full of stars: Brad Pitt, Morgan Freeman, Gwyneth Palthrow and the awesome 72nd Academy Award Winner Kevin Spacey (as leading role in AMERICAN BEAUTY). And the film was also an innovation in using weird and strange openings. This style was followed by several films like 'Mimic', 'Arlington Road', 'Spawn', 'Fight Club', etc.Focusing on the film, 'Se7en' introduces us Detectives David Mills (Brad Pitt) and William Somerset (Morgan Freeman) that are investigating several crimes which at first glance with no connection between them. After a deep search, they will find that only one man is behind all the murderers and with a philosophy: the seven capital sins.With this plot, the film seems to be as other productions of the genre, but it's not. There are several points of 'Se7en' that should be mentioned:<ul><li>Brilliant atmosphere, one of the most weird and strange sets and places never seen in a film. The fat man's apartment is incredibly created. There are lots of details, like in the sloth victim's house, with hundreds of that fraganced pine trees (you know, that things for the cars) hanging from the ceiling to cover the smell of the body.</li></ul><ul><li>Excellent performance of the acting crew: every character is well performed by its respective actor/actress. Special mention to Brad Pitt.</li></ul>
The following films of Fincher ('The Game', 'Fight Club', etc.) carry on the style created in 'Se7en'. I must say that all the thrillers produced after 'Se7en' are just a rough copy of Fincher's masterpiece: they have just copied the atmosphere of the film but with no success. 'Se7en' is the best one nowadays, no matter the budget, no matter the crew.
David Fincher makes the difference. 'Se7en' is an example, a brilliant masterpiece. WORTH LOOK!!!!!!! 10/10One thing that I still think about is: why didn't 'Se7en' win any Academy Awards Oscar in 1995? I found it unfair and still think so.",10,0,0,2 March 2001
Unbreakable," M. Night Shyamalan 'breaks' the theaters with this film
","M. Night Shyamalant has reached another time the audience with 'Unbreakable', a thriller film which combines tension and brilliant performance in a brilliant production without any spectacular visual effect, because the film doesn't need it.Bruce Willis and Samuel L. Jackson combine perfectly in performance: both of them shine in front of the camera as David Dunn and Elijah Price. The photography and camera positions are another two strong points of the film; Eduardo Serra has done a brilliant job, giving to the film a strange atmosphere, like in a dream.And here's the magic of 'Unbreakable': there are several parts where nobody talk, but the film transmits everything without words.Good plot, good ambience, brilliant performance and fantastic director are the necessary things to create a fantastic film. Why are not common good films as this? Because only Shyamalan can do it! Sure a worth lookin' 9/10",8,0,0,14 January 2001
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," Fantastic, Incredible, Outstanding... A f***ing must see!
","'South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut' can be considered one of the most original movies I've ever seen. First, the 'technology' applied in the cartoons is unique, 'cause despite the drawing style isn't very artistic, all the characters have personality and have their specific role in the plot.But, there's one point of the movie which has been criticized for good and for bad: the amount of swear words, scatologic situations and so on. I mean, it's not normal now to hear a conversation in a movie without any 'fuck' or any 'common' word in the street language ^_^ 'South Park' has reached and passed the rate of 'insults per minute' in the cinema, more than any Tarantino production.And that's one of the funny points of the film. However, I think that the most interesting intention of the movie is the criticism to the MPAA (Motion Picture Association of America), which do the ratings of movies. I won't tell ya about what's this criticism about, but I will mention one quote said by Sheila Broflovsky in the action (don't remember exactly but more less): 'The Free-Violence and the sadism are correct while there's no swear sword between'.I've been following the madness called 'South Park' for two years, and I'm able to affirm that these are one of the most funny, awesome and original cartoons even made!GO RUN TO THE THEATRE AND WATCH THIS OUTSTANDING FILM RIGHT NA'! 10/10",8,0,0,2 July 2000
The Others," Amenábar and Shyamalan: two brilliant directors
","Alejandro Amenábar has created another masterpiece of film. 'The Others' is an incredible production with everything that a film needs: brilliant story, incredible creepy atmosphere, brilliant recreation of the '40s and outstanding performances of Nicole Kidman and the rest of the crew.I didn't find the film slow at all. I went to the theater thinking of what I heard from lots of people: 'The film is good, but it's incredibly slooooooow'. But in my opinion, 'The Others' needs a deep atmosphere, with dark scenarios and only with candle lights. That's how Alejandro Amenábar has included the tension that keeps you frightened from the start till the end of the film.Nicole Kidman is incredible (in all the meanings ^_^). She performs her character (Grace) with a lot of credibility. Also the two children, specially Alakina Mann, do incredible performances.A thing that surprised me is that there's no blood on the film. At any time. We don't find terror movies without blood&guts these days. Also, there're no CGI or modern special effects in 'The Others', a thing that must remind us that the special effects are an addition to a film, not the main event of the production.SPOILER AHEAD:'The Others' is pretty close to 'The Sixth Sense' in different points. The plot is quite similar and the end too. Also the kind of atmosphere is really similar to Shyamalan's film. Even though, I'm not saying 'The Others' is not original. It's a brilliant production from one of my favorite directors. Keep on Alejandro!!! We're waiting for your next masterpiece!!!Worth look! 10/10",8,0,0,12 September 2001
Terminator Salvation," I don't understand the bad reviews at all...
","I'm not going to talk about the movie in detail (there are plenty of reviews about that). Instead, enough to say that it's an action-packed, enjoyable ride in the Terminator universe, with an OK plot and average actor performances. Since I knew McG was behind the camera, it was obvious the movie would not turn out as shiny as we wanted, but I enjoyed my time through the two-hour length of the film. Not an academy award best motion picture winner, but really enjoyable in the end. Great photography, jaw-dropping special effects with a balanced mixture between real and CGI elements, eye-candy believable terminator machines (don't know what bashers were expecting) and some enjoyable characters which lead the movie with such small effort.It gets to my nerves that lately everybody is waiting for the GREATEST MOVIE EVER MADE every time they go to the theatres. You may think I am being too indulgent with McG, Christian 'tantrum' Bale and the whole crew, but I had a good time enjoying this piece of visual entertainment which is Terminator Salvation. So if you are planning to have a nice time at your local theatre, give it a try. If you are ticking your Academy Awards' nominees list, just draw a cross in this one and move along. Otherwise, buckle up and enjoy the ride! :) 8/10",8,3,4,7 June 2009
Aquaman," The most spectacular movie I have seen in theaters to date
","Not the best movie, though. It is cheesy here and there, the story has plenty of plotholes. However, the pace, the action, the dialogues, the overall experience that this movie provides is top notch. Probably the most entertaining movie of 2018 (sorry Infinity War).",8,1,3,22 December 2018
X-Men," At last, a comic-book adaptation that makes justice!
","Finally, we can say that a film has reached the level of the comic-book version. First was Superman, that in its first film started the comic adaptation pictures. The 4 sequels that followed it were poor and quite sad.Then the Batman saga came. Tim Burton did a great effort to create the creepy & dark atmosphere of the flying hero. And the first and second part were ok, kinda interesting film. But the third and forth, created by Joel Schumacher were as bad as hell.So the level was incredibly low, a perfect opportunity for Brian Singer to create a well-done, thrilling action with brilliant sfx production.And X-MEN combines these three things: action, incredible visual effects and good plot, setting the film like the best comic-book adaptation I've ever seen. In fact, THE FILM IS SO GREAT THAT IT'LL GO LIKE A FLASH IN FRONT OF YOU, and you will say: 'that's it? I want more!!!!'.It is a worth looking!!!!!!!! 10/10",8,0,0,21 August 2000
Scary Movie 2," Stay away of this movie if you care for your brain...
","Scary Movie was rubbish. Its sequel is even bad. Now the question is: will the 3rd part be worse? Is it possible to be worse than Scary Movie 2?I'm afraid THIS will be possible, because when you have Wayans directing, you don't know what to expect. Scary Movie 2 is a bunch of bad sexual jokes, trying to recreate the humor of 'American Pie' or the Farrelli Bros.' style. But the whole film stinks from the beginning till the end. I must admit some gags made me laugh, but they don't compensate the big fat error 'Scary Movie 2' is.Please don't rent, buy or even see this movie. You'll be doing a favour to the humanity.",4,0,1,10 June 2002
Doctor Strange," My favorite MCU movie to date, even more than Endgame...
","I was blown away back in 2016 when I saw this in theaters and with some perspective after the initial impression, I can truly say this is my favorite MCU film to date. The story, the characters, the visual effects, the score... It feels like a better version of Iron Man (2008), in terms of introducing Doctor Strange into the character roster, hoping that we can enjoy many future movies of the Master of the Mystic Arts.I am ready for the MULTIVERSE OF MADNESS.",10,0,1,22 July 2019
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Begun, this new trilogy, NOW has!
","In 1999, the awaited Episode I of the STAR WARS saga was a reality. But 'The Phantom Menace' didn't achieve the level that the fans were wanting for the next chapter of one of the most popular sagas in the film industry. Furthermore, people became quite sceptic with George Lucas and his Episode I, II and III project: was it necessary to continue the trilogy with a prequel?Well, after three years of doubts and criticisms, the fifth part of STARWARS, 'The attack of the clones', has taken off from Lucasfilm and landed in the theaters, generating more expectation than 'Episode I'. Now, two questions in the air: Will it be better than the menace? Will it be better or equal to the first trilogy? The general opinion admits that Episode II is much much better than Ep I, and most fans say it's on 2nd position after 'The Empire Strikes Back'.George Lucas has created a masterpiece of adventure, sci-fi, romance and jedi, combining all these elements with astonishing harmony. The film is the longest in the saga, but the most enjoyable. All the characters, all the aliens, the locations... Everything shine in this film, nothing is avoidable: each part fits in 'The attack of the clones', giving to the audience an extremely enjoyable creation.As the story carries on, we see how Anakin comes closer to the Dark Side, how the unclear parts of the plot in the Ep IV, V and VI are revealed... In other words, how the Empire is born. The film has got lots of scenes that are clearly inspired from other movies: for example, the arena battle in Geonosis remembers the roman gladiator films and the pursuit in Coruscant is like James Bond films.In AOTC, we know a lot more about the Force itself and the Jedi Order. And finally, we see why Yoda is the Master, because after this chapter, nobody will doubt about his Jedi skills . Also, a creepy dark atmosphere is beginning to cover the STAR WARS universe, preluding to the Empire age.Ewan McGregor, Hayden Christensen, Natalie Portman, Samuel L. Jackson... Everybody in the film perform incredibly good their characters. Special mention to Frank Oz and his performance with Yoda's voice, the best in the four films that our favorite Jedi master has appeared.Brilliant special effects (much better than Ep I or LOTR), incredible performances and perfect plot. What do you want more for a STARWARS film? Definitely a worth look! 10/10George Lucas has shown he can create brilliant films. He disappointed us with 'The Phantom Menace' (but I still enjoy the film, anyway! ^_^), but that didn't mean Ep II was supposed to be bad or worse: it's far better than I expected. I hope Episode III as good as AOTC, or even better!!!! May the Force be with us in order to wait for 3 years more! Episode III to come!",5,0,0,23 May 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," One movie to bring, rule and bind the audience in Tolkien's imagination
","It seems an eternity since I heard for first time about the film production of 'The Lord of The Rings' (LOTR), the adaptation of J.R.R. Tolkien's literary masterpiece. And when I knew Peter Jackson was behind all the party, I was quite surprised: the creator of 'Braindead' and 'The Frighteners' conducting one of the most awaited trilogies in the cinema history? A bit strange, I must say... Well, after 2 years of waiting, several teaser trailers, and lots of previous merchandising, the LOTR is now a reality. The first chapter, 'The Fellowship of the Ring' (FOTR), has arrived like a blessing for all the film industry, in all possible meanings of blessing.For anyone who has read the book, the first impression that you should get from the film is that Peter Jackson has created a pretty close adaptation of the novel. Everybody knows that the novel adaptations to the screen are often not as good as the original book. Just read The Lost World or Sphere and compare with the films. Then judge. :P But in the FOTR, the adaptation is incredible. And also creating all the landscapes and the different locations of the novel: lots of people say that it's exactly how they had imagined it.Thank god Peter Jackson has joined a cast crew of 'not so known' actors! ^_^ Just imagine, for example, Sean Connery playing as Gandalf, or Brad Pitt as Strider... That doesn't mean that Sir Ian McKellen, Elijah Wood, Sean Bean, Viggo Mortensen, Hugo Weaving and the rest of the actors aren't good! Just the opposite! All characters are incredibly performed. Probably everyone should find in each character little differences from what he/she was expecting, but we can affirm that it was the way Tolkien would have wanted it.Talking about the film: the landscapes, the crowded battles, the incredible special effects... Everything is joined in astonishing harmony to bring into life a totally new world of fantasy and adventure. Probably the weak point of the FOTR is the rythm of the action. And it's not a lack of tempo, is possibly an excessive speed of the story. It's like they have tried to condense all the book in a 3 hour movie, which is quite difficult.
Of course that there're some missing parts in the film (like Tom Bombadil), but I can imagine the producers saying 'Hurry! Hurry! We're in the 2nd hour of the film and we're still in the middle of the novel! 400 pages ahead!!' :DAnyway, the film is an incredible masterpiece that has reached Tolkien fans and people who have never heard about the novel. I recommend to read the book before watching the film, it'll help to understand what's all the fuss about.I will steal the ending from another IMDB user comment: 'Lucas and Spielberg, learn how to do cinema'. WORTH LOOK!!! 10/10",10,0,0,4 January 2002
The Matrix Revolutions," The end of all things...
","(Spoilers through all the review)After having the big disappointment with 'The Matrix Reloaded' (MRL), I 'freed my mind' and went to watch 'The Matrix Revolutions' (MRV)with hope. Because I really liked the first part of the trilogy, but despite I knew the other parts were conceived as a single movie, I couldn't let myself think that MRL was somehow incomplete and abruptly ended. So I thought: 'let's avoid any MRV trailer or spoiler or anything', so I went to the cinema without expectations. And it worked, because I rather enjoyed the movie, even I still think the first part is the best one.MRV begins exactly where MRL ended, with Neo and Bane lying in comma. The first movie was about 'birth', the second about 'life' and MRV about 'death'. 'Ergo' ^_^U, the third installment of the Matrix trilogy is the darkest one: the machines'imminent attack, Neo trapped between the real world and the matrix world, Smith growing stronger... I feel it's kinda climatic movie and it's obviously dumb to see it if you definitely hated MRL, because they're a single movie.The plot is quite good; however, the preparations for the Zion invasion are very long. It's quite interesting how dark the Matrix world becomes as Smith absorbs more people. I've read several opinions from other reviews about Hugo Weaving overacting... IMHO, I think his performance is great like Keanu's. They're opposites and Neo's to be very good and Smith very bad, in order to 'balance the equation'. Trinity's death was quite shocking... I couldn't believe she had died, I felt very sorry for Neo, after saving her in the Matrix world, it was a very sad moment. When everything seemed to be lost, Neo gets plugged into the Matrix to confront again his nemesis Smith. The scene between them is incredible, very influenced by Dragon Ball Z, but it rocks anyway.The special effects are better than MRL: the squid invasion into Zion, the APUs, the Machine City (aka. 01), the Neo vs Smith final scene (aka. Super Browl)...Don Davis' score is amazing, I really like the music theme of the whole trilogy, quite unique so when you listen to it you directly relate it to the Matrix without hesitating. Maybe I missed some non-instrumental songs in the score, but the 'Neodämmerung' song is breathtaking, perfect for the 'Super Browl' scene.To sum up, 'The Matrix Revolutions' concludes the Matrix trilogy with several unresolved plot holes, in order to continue earning money with the Matrix fever. Because this is what it's all about. Despite what the Wachowski bros. say, the Matrix should have had no second nor third part. But when you see money ahead... you go after it. Good for the directors and producers, but bad for the fans who wanted a fair continuation for the first film. Instead, we got 'The Matrix Reloaded & Revolutions'.Anyway, worth a looking. :) 7/10",7,1,1,19 April 2004
American Psycho," Brilliant film for a brilliant novel!!
","First, I saw 'American Psycho' at the cinema. I found the film weird but brilliant, because I liked the way the US society was criticized.
Then, I took the novel 'American Psycho' of Bret Easton Ellis and I read it in a few days, because I couldn't get away from that book. I really enjoyed reading the novel, so I decided to rent the film and watch it again, in order to compare between the movie and the book, looking for parts of the novel not included in the film. My big surprise when I realized that most of the dialogues in the movie were exactly the same words in the book (this explains that 'deja vu' sensation I had reading the book ^_^). And that's a thing that doesn't normally happen. Just read Michael Crichton's 'Lost World' and compare it with the film... You'll see what I mean...'American Psycho' shows to the audience the emptiness of the society, the wisdom's mask that everybody wear to hide our darkest side. But for Patrick Bateman, a 27 year-old handsome guy, it's getting really tough to keep that mask on... But Patrick Bateman is not a poor worker, or a homeless: he works at Wall Street and earns $200.000 a year. In a world of expensive restaurants, night parties, cocaine, top models and lots of money, Bateman realizes how empty his life is.The film is truely an exercise of style, a mixture of comedy, thriller and terror. Christian Bale is outstanding as Patrick Bateman, he steals all the interpretation in the film. Willem Dafoe and Jared Leto are also there, but they don't shine like Bale.All the Bateman's monologues are incredible, literally taken from the Bret Easton Ellis' book. And the soundtrack is brilliant too. If you like 80's-early 90's music, prepare to listen to Phil Collins, Huey Lewis and the News, Withney Houston and many more!Just an advice: read the book, then watch the money, you will enjoy it much more! 9 out of 10",9,1,2,29 August 2001
Resident Evil," I wanna be a zombie to meet Milla :P~~~... Besides, the movie rocks!
","'Resident Evil' is one of those films that I was expecting with great interest. When the first rumors begun, George A. Romero was in charge of the project. When he jumped out the film, the name of Paul W. Anderson appeared, and everybody thought 'That guy rings me a bell...'.After some research, you realize Anderson as the director of controversial films such as 'Mortal Kombat' or 'Event Horizon'. And I say controversial because Paul's films have always had such great success and criticism both at the same time. And 'Resident Evil' will be the next victim...'Mortal Kombat' was a decent project that came out the same time 'Street Fighter' did. I admit both films are not a perfection, but Anderson created a better film than Steven de Souza's one. So, and possibly because of the cheesy adaptation of CAPCOM's videogame, 'Mortal Kombat' succeed in the duel, with good special effects and a few kicks and punches.'Event Horizon' is one of my favourite movies, combining gore and horror in a very dark atmosphere, which makes this film unique in its genre. It went through the cinemas with little success, but now it's on my TOP10 list. Anderson did a fine job with this movie, helped with the cast crew that were incredible (Sam Neil and Laurence Fishburne).And now we have 'Resident Evil'. First, I quickly recognized the same dark atmosphere of 'Event Horizon' in 'RE'. This strange way of Anderson to use the colours and the flashbacks, and also some scenarios were exactly reproduced from the videogame saga. The zombie makeup was very good, using CGI to create more realistic details. The Licker... well, if you survived watching the 'Brotherhood of the Wolf''s monster, you'll manage this one :P.Also, the movie has got incredibly good soundtrack: hard rock from Marylin Manson, Fear Factory, Rammstein and many others; and it fits perfectly with the film. And in addition, the movie has got very good rythm of action, so it absorbs you inside.The good points of the film: Milla Jovovich (of course ^_^), Paul Anderson's peculiar style, tons of action, some good scares and brilliant rythm. The bad points: the cast crew doesn't give an incredible performance, the whole plot is quite messy and the ending is too unconcluded (Sequel needed right now!). And in several scenes you can see the microphone (Anderson check out the takes next time, please)!!! :-PWell, if you liked the other Paul Anderson productions (I haven't seen 'Soldier', though), you'll really enjoy this one. And if you're also a fan of the videogames, then you'll die for watching 'Resident Evil' again and again. Waiting for the RE2! Worth a look! 8/10",7,0,0,16 April 2002
The Butterfly Effect," Brilliant, outstanding and surprisingly effective movie
","(Spoilers throughout the whole review, be warned :P)I heard about 'The Butterfly Effect' (TBE) from a friend of mine and even he told me it was really impressive, I couldn't find the time to go and watch it... till last weekend, when I went to the cinema, expecting something worth the watch. And sure it was :). TBE is one of the most entertaining movies I've seen in a while; I knew some bits and pieces of what the movie was about, but I couldn't make it up in my mind: 'childhood trauma? time traveling using dairies? what the hell are they thinking!'. It's obvious that when handling such a theme like time travels, you gotta be open-minded and try not the spend the whole movie yelling 'oh look, there's a time travel paradox' or 'how could this happen if he's not in that timeline...' and this kind of rubbish, because if you do, you'll ruin the movie.You just have to get comfortable in your seat, grab your popcorn bucket and enjoy. Because that's why movies are made for: to entertain the audience. So, expecting a 2 hour enjoyable, well-spent time, I went to see TBE. After a prologue scene which at first glance seems to be forwarding future events, we get introduced to Evan as a child. The first couple of situations embraces Evan's blackout problem and shows how many tragic events he had suffered during his childhood. As a doctor's advice to help him with his blackouts, he starts writing a diary, in order to keep his day-by-day experiences. After several unfortunate events and a fast-paced intro to Evan's life, we meet Ashton Kutcher as Evan in his 20's, going at the university, having a normal life, with no blackouts at all. But then, and with no reason, he finds out that when reading his diaries he wrote years ago, he gets back in time and is able to change the events, which means changing the future. So he starts finding out what happened when he had the blackouts, realizing several traumas he did not remember. And while at it, he tries to change the course of the tragic events that involved the girl he fancied, her brother and a friend. The more times he try to mend the futures of his friends, the worst they get. And that's quite an interesting way to keep you at the edge of your seat through the whole movie, because you can't see a good ending. It's getting worse and worse, and sometimes stupidly worse, but effective. IMO, Ashton Kutcher delivers an splendid performance, having different personalities during the whole movie. We'll see whether he evolves as an actor or he remains in the teenage-movie star cliché. I believe he's got the talent to evolve towards something more serious than his previous performances.'The Butterfly Effect' has got an incredibly fast-paced action, so fast that I was overwhelmed after 45 minutes! There's no movie out there that creeps you with child abuse, murder and traumatic events in a short period of time and gets a good result. The story embraced me, some moments scared the crap out of me, some others made me laugh, but I was kept entertained from the title to the ending credits. And when the last scene faded out, I realized I had been entertained during 2 hour-ish in front of a theater screen, which unfortunately it's not a common thing between nowadays movies. At least, that's what I think it's the main purpose of film-making: to entertain. And believe me, 'The Butterfly Effect' is a perfect example of entertainment.Definitely worth a look! 10/10",7,0,1,16 June 2004
Batman Begins," Batman couldn't have come back in better shape!
",">Spoiler Warning< It's been a week since I saw 'Batman Begins' and after several days getting rid of the thrilling sensation that the film gave to me, I feel like pointing out my opinions about the movie itself.When I first heard about a new Batman installment, I was quite skeptical about it. When Christian Bale was chosen to portrait Batman and his alter ego Bruce Wayne, I felt excited for two main reasons: I'm quite a fan of Bale and at the same time it could be the first time for him to prove the great actor he is to a major audience. When names like Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman, Liam Neeson and the others began to appear in the cast, I had great expectation for the movie.And it hasn't disappointed me at all. Clearly influenced by Frank Miller's Batman graphic novels, we're introduced into a dark, creepy and real (but not Gothic) Gotham City, a place which could be related to many big US cities in terms of social structure and atmosphere.Bruce Wayne's character is very interesting because you feel sorry for him but at the same time you may be annoyed by his arrogance and superiority, and I think that this duality has the purpose of making the character real, with his pros and cons. There's no time for comic-esquire action in 'Batman Begins': Director Christopher Nolan worked hard with writer David S. Goyer to create a credible story, with real characters and real locations. All Batman's arsenal seems to be real and, apart from the huge Batmobile, every gadget fits quite well in this environment of reality.Probably that's why some hardcore Batman fans have gone pretty mad after watching the film, saying that it's a James Bond-type movie, but with a guy dressed up like Batman. Anyway, that's the essence (I think) of 'Batman Begins', to tell a story of a real man who wants to fight injustice and he uses a symbol to terrorize those who use fear for their own purposes.'Batman Begins' is worth a look and probably it's one of the most solid productions I've ever seen in a while. Furthermore, the soundtrack is amazing too, created by Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard, they have helped to create the return of the caped crusader, who needed some fresh air after the last installment, Batman & Robin... huh. However, I'm not thinking about 'Batman Begins' as 'Batman 5' because it's a new fresh start, like a new saga. So, let the saga begin! :)",9,0,0,26 June 2005
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," I cannot help watching this movie without wondering what the first trilogy could have been.
","And with that statement, I do not want to manage down the original Lord of The Rings trilogy, which most of us agree they are far superior than The Hobbit trilogy. However, the budget difference between both trilogies is mind boggling. The first trilogy had a budget of $300 million overall, all three movies combined. The Hobbit trilogy costed around $800 million dollars to make. This means that almost each Hobbit movie had all the budget of all LOTR movies combined. As I said, mind boggling. I sometimes wonder how the original trilogy would have turned out, with that budget. I any case, 'The Hobbit' is another example of spending tons of cash does not make a good movie.Despite this, the Hobbit trilogy is a spectacle to watch, the story drags too much across the three movies and probably one single installment would have made more sense. However, Jackson, Boyens and Walsh managed to complement the original novel with bits and pieces of the LOTR books and the Silmarillion, making the next installment of the cinematic Tolkien Universe.This movie was panned down by critics. Overall, the trilogy amassed around $3 billion, exactly what the first trilogy did. I think the world is ready for more movies set in the Tolkien world. Do you know there is a TV show coming up, right? I cannot wait.",8,1,1,10 November 2018
Saving Private Ryan," I will never forget this overwhelming film
","I don't like war films. Definitely. But I definitely think 'Saving Private Ryan' cannot be considered only like a war movie. I mean, films like 'Rambo', 'Commando' and that kind of productions have one point in common: the main character is a hero, 'the strongest man on Earth', 'the renegade who's escaped from the bad fellas' and 'the only one who can achieve this mission'.In 'Saving Private Ryan', the war vision goes one step... Not one, a bunch of steps far from the typical war film. It's not about the typical story of a 'how-strong-and-brave-I-am' mercenary. The plot introduces us in the feelings, the experiences that a soldier has in a battle field: fear, agony & pain. And this message reached deeply in the audience, because you feel somehow uncomfortable when watching the film. And there's the power of the film, the way with which focuses the sensations and fearings of the character is overwhelming.Steven Spielberg has done a masterpiece, demonstrating that he can do any kind of genre in the film industry. It's a must see. 10/10",9,1,1,20 July 2000
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Peter Jackson's LOTR, or how the purists will speak the hell out of him...
","After watching 'The Two Towers' (TTT) twice, I've realized that 'The Lord Of The Rings' (LOTR), apart from establishing itself as one of the pillars of the modern literature, it will achieve the same position in the 7th art world. Those sceptics that prophesied that the ambitious project of Peter Jackson would be a disaster, those guys should keep away from the theaters. Because they aren't obliged to watch Peter Jackson's interpretation of Tolkien's universe.I believe the 'purists' of the LOTR world won't agree with me when I say that Peter Jackson is leading an incredible job in conjunction with a huge number of people that forms the LOTR staff. Lots of fans complain about that Jackson has sort of invented some parts of the original story created by JRR Tolkien and they ironically say that the film should be titled 'Peter Jackson's The LOTR'...For God's sake, if you're so critic, go on: 'The Hobbit' and 'The Silmarillion' movies are still to be made. Look for a producer who gives you a millionaire budget and show me what you've got ^_^We must understand that Peter Jackson is just another Tolkien's fan who has had the guts to take on with one of the most ambitious projects in the film history and in the movie-adaptation-from-novel thing.TTT is the culmination of what 'The Fellowship Of The Ring' (FOTR) was. In the first chapter of the trilogy, everything is shown up but in fact you left the cinema with a bit of emptiness, like smelling the food but not eating it. In the TTT, which is the heart of the novel, it's where the story goes on and the action progresses.Let me talk about plot for a second. (beware: spoiler imminent :P). If you've read the book, then you'll have the same `deja vu' sensation you had in FOTR. But you could possibly complain about the bigger amount of parts which are not in or differ from the book. I think Peter Jackson has done well not including some parts of the novel and I will prove it with the ending of TTT: it's better to end the movie right in front of Mordor than inside Mordor, as the book ends. It's more... movie-like.Also, it's so astonishing how Jackson has achieved a level in the movie to keep up the story because, in my opinion (this is when the `purists' will hang me ^_^),  TTT novel is the most difficult to read, because of the plot, which is quite plain compared with the 1st and 3rd book.
Talking about the characters, there are new people around the plot, like Éowyn, Théoden, Gríma Wormtongue. but in my opinion the best one is Gollum, such an incredible and realistic CGI character (probably the best one up to date), who steals the acting from Sam and Frodo in some sequences (just don't miss the dialogue between his two personalities. Worth of an Oscar!).
Aragorn is probably less active in this sequel, probably because Legolas rocks with his acrobatic movements! Gimli has got a clown-like role, that I really hated through all the film, but however, he somehow fit in it.In conclusion, I'd like to say that `The Two Towers' is one of the most solid sequels I've ever seen. It's darker than the first one and the action is more intense. Peter Jackson is handling the situation with great success. I cannot wait to see `The Return Of The King'. Worth a look! 10/10
PD: BTW, c'mon Lucas! Don't spend 3 years to do a movie! Learn from Peter Jackson! ^_^",9,0,0,29 December 2002
Moulin Rouge!," 'The greatest thing you'll ever learn is just to love and be loved in return'
","When I saw the 'Moulin Rouge!' trailer, I became sceptic with the film. Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman teased the audience, two brilliant actors in a musical could be interesting. But when I knew the person behind all the production was Baz Luhrmann ('Romeo+Juliet'), I thought it would be a strange, surrealistic film, like his other movies.I became more interested with the film when I heard that the music in 'Moulin Rouge!' was including many greatest modern hits from U2, Nirvana, Elton John... That really surprised me, never expecting this twist in the film: 'Smell Like Teen Spirits' or 'All You Need Is Love' in the beginnings of the 20th century? It was sure a worth look.Finally, I saw the movie. And I must admit that 'Moulin Rouge!' has reached deep inside on me. It has captivated the audience with its strength, its colourful shots, its 'fairy tale' atmosphere, returning to the classical musical films, but with a cool modern look.Some people would say 'Moulin Rouge!' lacks in plot. Just think for a moment: since when do musical movies emphasize in the story? Like 'West Side Story' or 'The Wizard of Oz', the most important thing is the music! Ewan McGregor plays the role of Christian, who falls in love with Satine (Nicole Kidman), the most beautiful girl on the Moulin Rouge, in Paris. It will start a relationship full of obstacles, which will end tragically...I think that the important points of the film are the rythm of the movie and the music. From the end until the beginning you won't be able to get out of the film. It will absorb you until the end. And in order to catch all the details, you should buy or rent it when it hits the stores, because in the cinema you will be overwhelmed by its greatness.One thing that really reached me is the beautiful message that delivers the film to the watcher: 'The greatest thing you'll ever learn is just to love and be loved in return'. That's what all the people should keep in mind.Anyway, 'Moulin Rouge!' is really a worth look. Charming, outstanding, fascinating and brilliant. What can I say more? The soundtrack is great and the DVD too! Really really a worth look! 10/10",10,0,1,21 December 2001
Event Horizon," Don't waste your precious time with other terror-wannabe movies...
","Do you want a dark and gruesome movie to scare the crap out of you? Don't hesitate and watch 'Event Horizon', a breathtaking, deep film with awesome atmosphere, one of the best I've ever seen in the genre. Directed by Paul Anderson ('Mortal Kombat', 'Soldier' and in a short time 'Resident Evil'), recreates the typical haunted house story, but in the future and instead of a house, a spaceship.The plot is really interesting and creepy: a salvage expedition travels to Neptune to recover the 'Event Horizon', a gigantic spaceship that is supposed to travel faster than the light speed by using the blackholes power. In its first journey, it became lost mysteriously. 7 years later, it suddenly appeared in the Neptune orbit.(SPOILER AHEAD!!!)Captain Miller (Laurence Fishburne) and his salvage crew and Dr. Weir (Sam Neill) will find that the spaceship in these 7 years has visited another dimension, 'a dimension of pure chaos, of pure evil', as they realize that the ship is alive!(SPOILER ENDED) :)'Event Horizon' is a very frightening film. Not because of the gore only, but the story too. It's really deep and scary. I watched the movie on VHS, a pity because this movie must be incredible in the cinema! That reminds me my friends, that went to see the movie in the theaters. When they went out, they were pale! It's true. They found 'Event Horizon' weird and violent. Maybe they're right. What do you think? Go and see it! 9 out of 10",6,2,4,8 June 2001
Mission: Impossible II," Where's the Mission Impossible?
","I mean, where's the thrilling-intelligent-packed movie which was the first 'Mission:Impossible'? Brian De Palma made a fine conversion from the TV series, ya know, incredible 'James Bond'-type situations, suspense and elaborated plot... But this film isn't 'M:i-2', it's just 'How to be a pretty action hero, kill some bad folks & win a beauty girl'.I'm not saying that 'M:i-2' is crap. It's not. But I see it's nearer the HongKong-type films than the M:i TV series.Despite the result of the film like a Mission:impossible sequel, John Woo fans will love it. It has all the small things that make Woo's creations different: fantastic shooting scenes, incredible camera movements, spectacular one-to-one fights, awesome pursuits and, of course, a very good-smart-handsome hero and the bad-to-bone villain. And the pigeons, of course :)Just one thing: M:i-2 affirms that typical sentence: '2nd parts aren't good'. It's not as good the first one, but it's not a bad film. If you're looking for action, technology, incredible situations, beautiful women and a very cool Tom Cruise, you'll get it! 7/10",7,0,0,10 July 2000
Black Hawk Down," The US should have had a better strategy...
","'Black Hawk Down' can be considered as a successor of 'Saving Private Ryan', the Steven Spielberg production that changed the war genre movies. Following the 'Saving Private Ryan' path, 'Black Hawk Down' shows the audience the crude, non-heroical and believable war, and not the 'Rambo'-type vengeance.
Ridley Scott is the director of this incredible production. Some of his previous films have enchanted the audience (Alien, Gladiator, 1942), other productions from him have become not so brilliant (G.I. Jane, Hannibal). But 'Black Hawk Down' is that kind of films that absorb the audience deep in the action, incredibly recreating the US incursion that occured in Mogadiscio, 1993.The first thing you notice when watching the film is the hugeness of the action. I can't understand how they did it to create a city scale war zone: the helicopters flying above all the city, the landings of the aircrafts, the hundreds and hundreds of extras... It's like combining the majesty of 'Gladiator' and the action and drama of 'Saving Private Ryan', which creates a brilliant masterpiece.You'll find such veterans and rookie actors in the crew: Josh Harnett, Tom Sizemore (who seems to enjoy the war movies ^_^), Orlando Bloom (Legolas Greenleaf in the LOTR), Eric Bana and many more familiar faces. Plus also Ewan McGregor.The plot is quite simple. The Delta Force and Marines plan the attack and they completely fail. I like this movie because of that: it shows the bad strategy and the bad coordination that the american army had in that conflict, and everything because they understimated the somalian forces.The weak point of the film should be that in some parts, the patriotic and heroic vision of the war emerges from the reality which makes interesting 'Black Hawk Down', I mean, Ridley Scott's production is more 'holliwodish' than 'Saving Private Ryan', because you have your blond-hair blue-eye handsome good troops and the bad to the bone somalian army. But I like the way US is ridiculed.A great film that makes us remember the big mistake that the US forces did in Mogadiscio. Worth look! 10/10",8,0,0,24 February 2002
The Matrix Reloaded," The Matrix Refunded or 'The conception of an average flick, earning lots of money'
","(COULD CONTAIN SPOILERS THROUGH ALL THE TEXT, SO BEWARE)I saw 'The Matrix Reloaded' a month ago, and after assimilating the film, I've decided to expose my opinions, through this review. My first statement would be... WHAT A BIG DISAPPOINTMENT! :(Probably the most expected movie of last centuries, 'The Matrix Reloaded' begins a new chapter in a post-apocalyptic future world where humans are slaves of the machines, for energetic profits, prisoners in a virtual simulation called the 'matrix'. Zion, the last human city, is home of thousands of humans who have rejected the so called 'matrix' program or have been saved by the soldiers of the Resistance. The machines are about to strike Zion and eradicate all living form in the city. For that's why all the captains of Zion's fleet summon a meeting, in order to decide the best strategy against the attack.'The Matrix Reloaded' is the creation of the Wachowski Brothers, two young directors who love japanimotion, cyberpunk, videogames and Hong-Kong action movies. So, the film would be a combination of these 4 ingredients. If you dislike one of those 4 things, then I recommend you to be careful with this movie, because you'll find points that you will not be able to accept nor understand.First, you must keep that true topic in mind: '2nd parts are worse'. Well, 'The Matrix Reloaded' is indeed worse than the first chapter, probably because the expectation, the trailer galore uploaded on the Internet... You would find lots of cons in the movie, but the most important flaw is the plot, its lack of a solid plot I must say...Second, you should watch `The Matrix Reloaded' as the first `half-time' of the 5 hour movie that includes `Reloaded' and `Revolutions', so don't complain about the ending if it's rough and opened, because it's like watching a movie on the TV with ads.The film begins with a kickass action sequence with Trinity aka the first scene in the original film. Then the 'Trinity jumping out the building followed by an agent' scene, which is a demonstration of the new 'bullet-time' technology used in this chapter. Then it follows the captain's meeting scene that ends up in the first Neo's fight in the movie, which in fact it's short and with no pace at all. Neo flies out the place and does his 'superman' thing. At this point, lots of fans are cursing the directors...But the 'best' part hasn't arrived yet. After the Morpheus' Martin Luther King wanna be crappy speech, the rave/orgy party starts, with lots of nice chicks and guys dancing, all sweaty and sexy, like some kind of Christina Aguilera video. Question is: `what the hell they were thinking?!'.We will never know. Then after Neo & Oracle conversation, the Smith vs Neo round: I would compare this scene with the Yoda vs Dooku scene in Ep2, because both are risky scenes that need special effort to elaborate if they don't want to end it up stupid and false. I believe the Neo vs Smith scene is one of the best points in the movie. Despite the CGI is noticeable in several moments, the scene is enjoyable and eye candy.The Merovingian scenes are quite odd. He delivers a speech that seems to be out of the plot completely (which in fact it's not), then Persephone kissing Neo, then the great staircase fight scene. The freeway chase scene that follows would be the reason to watch the film, an incredible use of the cinematographic techniques, achieving one of the most spectacular chases ever made. The Architect speech scene... well, most part of the audience got lost, but if you listen carefully the wordiness of the speech, you'll realize that it's the result of using the synonyms dictionary to change every word into an understandable bunch of extremely large sentences.
The actors perform exactly the same way they did in `The Matrix', but that doesn't mean their performances are as good as in the first film. Laurence Fishburne continues his Morpheus performance with an annoying Shakespearian cadence that may be a bit excessive in several moments. Keanu Reeves is performing a boring Neo, with no emotions nor reactions at all, with the same flat expression through the entire movie. Agent Smith follows his desires of liberty, showing bad attitude and anger, free now that he's no more `plugged' to the system. Trinity is more active this time, leading the freeway chase scene with great presence and performance.
The new characters are quite strange. The Merovingian and Persephone are the bad guys of the film for sure, the white ghost twins are just an excuse to show how good the SFX crew is, and they haven't got any plot meaning.
As you can see, `The Matrix Reloaded' is made of bits & pieces, like a rough collage of talking heads, nonsense dialogues, cheap philosophy and spectacular (but sometimes cheesy) CGI. It's a crossover between the japan animation and the videogame, so don't expect a solid argument. The directors could have delivered a great plot with good story, but they have preferred the economic benefit rather than the good criticism.The truth is that the Wachowskis have created the largest and most intelligent merchandising movement around a movie in the 7th art history. If you want to catch everything in the movie or if you want to fill in the plot holes, you should have a look at the 9 animated short films called the ANIMATRIX and play the ENTER THE MATRIX videogame. Both ANIMATRIX and ENTER THE MATRIX come with very important information about the movie plot.
To sum up, `The Matrix Reloaded' is not the brilliant and imaginative film the first chapter was. It has got splendid breathtaking scenes, but in global the movie lacks of everything in every moment. The fans expected more from the Wachowski brothers, but in fact they gave us a film not easy to swallow, but with a clear tagline: FREE YOUR MIND. That's what you should do when watching `The Matrix Reloaded'.7/10",8,0,0,10 June 2003
Vanilla Sky," 'Vanilla Sky' or Crowe's 'Abre los ojos' own interpretation
","First of all, I'd like to point out that 'Vanilla Sky' should be not considered as a straight remake of 'Abre los ojos', but a film that teach us how to tell the same story in a different way. The Amenábar version was darker and more creepy than Crowe's one in all elements: the story hadn't the fairytale atmosphere that 'Vanilla Sky' has got, the characters were darker and more serious, the shots and lightning were more creepy and so on.That's where 'Vanilla Sky' had the mistake. People were expecting the dark thriller that was 'Abre los ojos', but instead of that, the audience recieves an 'americanized' version, more colorful and beautiful indeed, adding to the story the fairy-tale style that Crowe's has given to the film.
Tom Cruise, Penélope Cruz, Jason Lee, Kurt Russel and Cameron Diaz, all of them have incredible performances, better than I expected (I'd probably not say out loud Diaz did a good performance).I only do this comments for that kind of movies that surprise me, or make worth my money spent. So, 'Vanilla Sky' is worth the money and the surprise :) A must-see 9/10",9,0,0,3 October 2002
X2: X-Men United," Joins the small group of sequels that surpass the original movie...
","I trusted the young genius called Bryan Singer when he started 4 years ago what was going to be the best comic book adaptation saga of all time. X-MEN had been dwelling through years as an ambitious project, very difficult to recreate on the big screen and lots of fans easy to be disappointed... It was in 1999 when Bryan Singer, the director of the acclaimed 'The Usual Suspects' started the first chapter of the X-MEN. Everyone was quite skeptical about the success of the film, so FOX didn't risk into an astronomic budget production. Only $40 million were avaliable to create a movie which was supposed to be full of SFX, CGI and incredible action...
The director wasn't very popular, nor the acting crew: probably, the most known actor in all the crew was Patrick Stewart, whose popularity in 1999 was because of his role as Cpt. Jean-Luc Picard in the STAR TREK Universe... But that changed after perfoming as Professor Charles Xavier in the X-Men. James Mardsen (Cyclops), Hugh Jackman (Wolverine), Ian McKellen (Magneto), Halle Berry (Storm), Famke Janssen (Jean Grey), Anna Paquin (Rogue), Rebecca Romjin-Stamos (Mystique)... 'Who the hell are they?', people said. Well now, 4 years after the film, all the 'X-crew' is well known in the cinema industry, most of them performing in blockbuster movies such as 'The Lord of The Rings' (Ian McKellen as Gandalf), 'Swordfish' (Hugh Jackman) and 'Monster's Ball' (Halle Berry).'X-MEN 1' astonished the audience, not because the SFX: it's the humanity which is present through the movie. When Stan Lee created the X-Men in the '50s, his main purpose was to reflect the ideals of the afroamerican revolution which was happening in those years... Malcom X, Martin Luther King, they fought for their people in order to defend its rights against the oppression and rejection from the white people, only because they were different. Singer took this idea and put it in front of the audience. Instead of making a popcorn comic flick such as Spider-Man or Blade, he made a complex plot, worked characters and incredible stylish action.All the skeptics shut their mouths at once after watching the movie and the audience requested out loud a sequel. 3 years after the first movie, X2 is a reality. And what's the difference between the two movies?
First, the budget. This time, FOX let Bryan Singer spend about $150 million to create a decent sequel. In consequence, you have more special effects, more action and more style. But before thinking X2 as a popcorn-SFX only film, made only to make money (which in fact, it is :P), the plot is much better than the first movie, the characters are much more evolved and worked. Nobody is a second rank character. Even the school mutant kids have their part in the main plot. The 'main' character is still Wolverine, though.New characters? Well, you'll see Nightcrawler (Alan Cumming, great performance), whose first appearance is one of the best action sequences ever seen. Then there's Lady Deathstrike (Kelly Hu), a threat for Wolverine... Colossus, Banshee, Jubilee, Prof. Hank McCoy (Beast), the Mastermind... They all make their short appearances.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ BEWARE  SPOILER  BEWARE ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Don't read the spoiler if you haven't seen the movie. If you do, it will ruin you the end sequence... ^_^
Jean Grey gets more involved in the action and in her main comic book story. The X-MEN comic fans will know about the Dark Phoenix Jean Grey. Well I don't know how Singer will adapt this event of the comic book, but in the last take of the X2, when the camera pans down to the water where Jean Grey has died, you can see a blurry shape, a fire bird shape emerging from the water... Just before it's becoming clear and revealing, black screen with the letters 'Directed by Brian Singer' appears...
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~     END OF SPOILER    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
When the credits start to roll up, the X-MEN Fans will shout: 'F*CK!' lol If you hate the 'opened endings' or a 'Wait for the next movie' end type, leave the film before it ends. I saw the movie yesterday at night and right now I'm wandering how X3 will be.Great work, Bryan, great work, actors. If you keep on like this, the X-MEN saga will be remembered as the best comic adaptation films ever made.

The Sixth Sense," Awesome, spectacular...
","The Sixth Sense is one of the best films in the century. It's a fantastic story with incredible atmosphere and a tension that won't let you at all. It has everything you'd want in a perfect and brilliant film: very good plot, fine special effects and a good performance of all the actors/actresses in the film.I must admit that Bruce Willis does a great performance, but I think the best actor in the cast crew is Haley Joel Osment. In my opinion, he does the best performance I've ever seen from a young actor. The way he acts, transmitting the feelings of Cole Sear is amazing.  I think he'll win an OSCAR.So, everyone should go and see The Sixth Sense, because that is a good example how a film has to be done.",9,0,2,19 January 2000
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," The Best Trilogy Ever Conceived!
","After watching the three chapters of 'The Lord Of The Rings', I'm able to say out loud that Peter Jackson has created one of the best productions in history. His talent and how he has involved crafting the 3 movies have erased any possible doubts about his directing skills. Because back 3 years ago, there were lots of criticisms about letting Mr. Jackson direct what was one of the most ambitious projects in the movie world. And they also criticized the casting of known actors as Elijah Wood, Liv Tyler...IMO, I'm sure nobody will surpass for a long time what LOTR has achieved as a trilogy. His conception was somehow brilliant and risky at the same time filming the whole trilogy in one year and a half, nonstop, in New Zealand, away (luckily) from the Hollywood influences. But Peter Jackson knew exactly what he had to do. He knew what New Zealand's landscape could offer to recreate the Middle Earth, he took the most outstanding and skillful crew to assure that the movies will make justice to Tolkien's novel and satisfy the fans. Nobody knows how much work the LOTR crew has done for the sake of the trilogy, but watching the films, you get the idea: you usually don't step into the cinema and watch a movie that is as detailed as the Lord Of The Rings trilogy. Far away from being a Hollywood popcorn movie, all three movies evoke emotion, fear and worship.The first chapter, 'The Fellowship Of The Ring' was introductive, setting up the story and the characters. 'The Two Towers' was the transition between the beginning of the novel and the epic end that was told in 'The Return Of The King'. The last chapter of the trilogy, IMO, is the best one, for so many reasons.First of all, it's the book that I enjoyed the most. So, I was willing to see several parts from the novel translated into eye-candy. Also it's the end, the conclusion, so it has to be huge and epic. I've been astonished by 'The Return Of The King', the plot is brilliantly taken from the book, with several retouches for movie's sake. After watching the whole trilogy, you realize it was a good idea to leave the last TTT's chapters for the last movie. These changes are necessary for the movie, because being faithful to the book doesn't mean to copy everything on it.The cast is awesome in the whole trilogy, but I think they're superb in the last movie, because the characters are evolving and each one of them is unique and deep. The SFX are great and very authentic, plus the score is brilliant. Howard Shore has surprised me with his geniality.I'll probably say nothing new about The Lord Of The Rings' trilogy, but I've got a statement: we're so lucky to have lived the conception of one of the best trilogies ever made, and I think that it'll be remembered for a long time.Definitely worth a look! 10/10",10,1,2,25 January 2004
The Matrix," Let's ponder on the influence of 'The Matrix' to the whole industry...
","It is funny how it has been 15 years since 'The Matrix Revolutions', bringing the movie trilogy to a close. I wrote reviews for it and 'Reloaded' as well back in 2003 and I realized that I had never written a few lines for the first movie. Well, here I am.I will keep it short. We all know how good 'The Matrix' is. The plot, the visuals, the mythos, it all adds up to a movie experience that is timeless. Almost 20 years later, it now has a 'retro' vibe that makes it more interesting, with late 90s cars, rotary phones, Nokia cells and CRT monitors.Today sets the 4K HDR release of the trilogy. Coming back to 'The Matrix' after probably 10 years since my last viewing, it is a constant reminder of how the Wachowski's masterpiece shaped up the movie industry and its echos are still felt today.A true timeless piece of movie history.",10,14,19,31 October 2018
Evil Dead II," Bruce Campbell shines in the best terror movie of all times!!
","After the succeed with Evil Dead I, Sam Raimi had to prepare a sequel as soon as possible. Five years after 'The Evil Dead', 'Evil Dead II: Dead By Dawn' appeared with a great expectation.One curious point is that the film is not a continuation of the 'Evil Dead'. It's a remake of the story, quite changed but still the same base. Instead of being a pure frightening horror movie, Sam Raimi included the comical part of the action. And with the performance of Bruce 'The Master' Campbell, the movie became an incredible success.The combination of Bruce Campbell and Sam Raimi has created one of the best terror movies of all history. Evil Dead was the first and the best, Evil Dead II improved several things from the first of the saga, and the 'Army of Darkness' concluded the Evil Dead Trilogy with a film full of adventure and less horror.But, in my opinion, Evil Dead II is the best of the three, because it's frightening & funny at the same time, Campbell rocks in the film with his outstanding performance, and the effects are very original and well-done for a non-commercial production.Just say that Evil Dead II is a must see for everyone who likes the horror genre!! 10/10",9,1,1,14 September 2000
