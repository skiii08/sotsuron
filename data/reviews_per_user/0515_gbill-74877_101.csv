Blade Runner 2049," Gorgeous, but falls a little short
","'Blade Runner 2049' starts strong, with a clean, taut story, and stunning visuals from director Denis Villeneuve. This time the blade runner (Ryan Gosling), the officer responsible for 'retiring' the bioengineered humans referred to as replicants, is a replicant himself, but with a new design to make him more subservient. Early on he uncovers shocking evidence that a female replicant from the past actually gave birth, and is immediately at the center of a conflict between his boss (Robin Wright), who wants to find and kill the offspring, and an industrialist (Jared Leto), who wants to learn the secret of this miracle and build a massive labor force.As with the first Blade Runner, the film raises some interesting philosophical questions. What does it mean to be a sentient being? Can an engineered being deserve what we want as people - freedom, love, and happiness? And what are the ethics of humanity building such beings? The blade runner has a holographic girlfriend (Ana de Armas), and in one scene, she arranges a prostitute for him, since she herself is disembodied. It's pretty wild when one reflects it's a computer program arranging for sex for a robot. Unfortunately, the philosophical points don't deliver nearly as much as in the first film, where Rutger Hauer faced his mortality and wanted so desperately to meet his maker, those aspects of existence most profoundly human, culminating with that devastating scene in the rain.Like the first film, this one has a slow pace, but at 163 minutes, it's much longer, and probably too long. It does allow for the story to gradually unfold and all those gorgeous images, but it drags, and I was not a fan of how it played out. The story line muddles a bit, and then rather than being complete, sets itself up for sequels and presumably a franchise. That was a real shame, and on its own lowered by review score by half a tick. The performances are all strong, and it was nice to see Harrison Ford still getting it done at age 75. Overall it's a solid sequel, which is tough to do given the legendary film it follows, but it falls a little short.",7,0,0,8 July 2018
Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Entertaining, and completes the story
","Highlights:
<ul><li>Completes the story and fills out the characters.</li><li>Uma Thurman is perfect in the lead role. The scenes where she's training under the old master, Pai Mei (Gordon Parks) are fantastic.</li><li>The buried alive scene is horrifying and iconic.</li><li>The black mamba and ensuing fight between Daryl Hannah (Elle) and Thurman is also very satisfying.</li><li>The fish out of water analogy for life/death, and the comments about Superman/Clark Kent during an otherwise slow scene. It's an action film but Tarantino occasionally sprinkles in some wonderful bits of dialogue or monologue.</li><li>As usual with Tarantino, the homage to these genres and the sheer joy of filmgoing really comes through.</li></ul>Lowlights:
<ul><li>David Carradine as Bill. Far too old at 68, lisping through his dialogue-heavy scenes, and not nearly strong and menacing enough. The final chapter was pretty tepid.</li><li>Pacing was too slow, particularly early and late (starting with the weak scene with the pimp). It seems the right balance was not found between the two films, and it would have been much better tightened up and a single film, 2.5 to 3 hours long.</li><li>The two instances in this volume (to go with one in the first) of female characters intent on killing one another and immediately stopping because a child is present (in one case, in utero) gets a little ridiculous. After being shot in the face, raped over years in a hospital, sliced up and shot some more, buried alive, etc she's going to stop to make sandwiches and cuddle? It's an homage to strong women characters who can also be mothers which is great, but these bits ring false, culminating in that ultra-cheesy last line about the lioness rejoining her cub.</li></ul>Still though, despite all my gripes, it's a very fun film. Tarantino sets the bar higher with everything he puts into his films, and sometimes it's easy to forget that in critiquing them. While we can see where this one is going, we really have no idea what he's going to put on the screen next, and he's always entertaining.",8,1,2,26 September 2019
Vertigo," Wonderfully disturbing
","What a wonderful, creepy, beautiful, disturbing film this is. From the opening credits, Hitchcock makes us uneasy with spiraling patterns on the screen, which hints at the vertigo/acrophobia to follow, but what we find are so many other disturbances and twists of the mind: obsession, guilt, insanity, and manipulation. There is creepy sexual desire, and what self-abasing lengths a woman will go to do what 'does it' for a man. Jimmy Stewart turns in a great performance, but as a nitpick, he's twice the age of Kim Novak (50 and 25), and also looks too old to have gone to college with his sidekick Barbara Bel Geddes (who's great by the way). The film takes place in absolutely gorgeous scenery in San Francisco, Muir Woods and Mission San Juan Bautista, and it's at once both dream-like and nightmarish. It feels like a quiet movie with its pace and small cast, but there is tension and mystery throughout. There are several stunning moments, which I won't spoil, and the ending is absolutely brilliant. Hitchcock's delving into dark places of the mind, his storytelling, and his camera angles, are all superlative. Excellent film.",9,5,6,28 July 2017
Come and See," Masterpiece
","There's a moment in 'Come and See' when director Elem Klimov directly references Tarkovsky's classic 'Ivan's Childhood' - it's when the boy peers down into a well and sees his reflection in the water - and there are probably all sorts of other parallels as well, such as that beautiful scene when he's in the forest shaking the tall trees with the girl to make the water splash down. It really made me want to see the films back to back and compare them in their imagery, camera technique, and what they tell us about the Russian experience during the war. This film is certainly darker (much darker, my god), and a part of me thinks that Klimov was building on the great Tarkovsky's work and saying that this was Ivan's real childhood, a nightmare of apocalyptic proportions.I don't think anyone who watches the film can ever forget the horrifying images of the German army running amok over a Byelorussia village and burning its people alive. That it's accurate - and just one of 628 such atrocities - is truly mind-numbing. But Klimov also gives us indelible visuals earlier in the film, such as the when the boy and girl run down the muddy road in search of his family, and she looks back to see a pile of corpses against the house, or later when they wade through the muck of a bog that comes up to their chests and looks like it might drag them down to their deaths. The scene in the fog on the farm as they scavenge for food and steal a cow is memorable too. The German army is distant for much of the film, bombing from above in the forest scene (for which the audio effects are extraordinary), shooting from afar, and driving troop trucks by in the mist. They're distant, that is, until they're not, and then it's overwhelming.The Soviet Union made some tremendous films about the war ('The Ascent', a film from Klimov's wife, the great Larisa Shepitko, also comes to mind), and this is certainly one of the very best; it has to be on a short list for greatest war movies of all time. There is a patriotic feeling to the film in the stern look the partisan leader gives the Germans and a pride in the perseverance of the Russian people, but mostly this is a sorrowful film about the horror of war coupled with a desire to never let what happened be forgotten. It certainly succeeds in that, because that's what this film is - unforgettable.Quote, from Revelation 6:7-8:
'And when he had opened the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the fourth beast say, Come and see. And I looked, and behold a pale horse: and his name that sat on him was Death, and Hell followed with him. And power was given unto them over the fourth part of the earth, to kill with sword, and with hunger, and with death, and with the beasts of the earth.'",9,3,4,5 February 2020
It," Needed restraint
","A film that needed some subtlety, but then again I'm not into modern horror so take whatever I say with a grain of salt (or ignore this review entirely). I wasn't wild about the canned moments to induce shock, the CGI, and the gratuitous violence, and wish some restraint had been exercised (but I know I'm in the minority, and what the hell did I expect?-) I did like the underlying symbolism of the evil that besets this town and these kids. It's unleashed every 27 years, which I took to represent each new generation that comes along. Everyone has their demons while growing up, their fears, their nightmares. We see evil in the form of sadistic bullying, incestual rape, and in the apathy to kids who simply disappear - all of which are real life things. Adults are rarely to be seen, and when they are, it's certainly not to bring order to the chaos. It's clearly written through the lens of the adolescent and the hell of growing up. Standing up to one's fears and sticking together is the only hope of overcoming them, and it felt like it echoed some of the themes of 'Stand By Me' in that way. I think if it had been tightened up - edited down, less haphazard, less jump scenes, shorter - I think it would have been more powerful. I also wasn't a fan of the unabashed reference to a sequel at the end. If you're into the genre, I'm sure you'll like it better. Hey, I'm just a guy who thinks of the earlier 'It' movie - and no, not the 1990 version of the same Stephen King story, the 1927 lighthearted film starring Clara Bow. :p",4,0,2,7 November 2018
Hereditary," Solid horror film
","Solid throughout and I really appreciated the fact that it was a horror film with intelligence. This family has a ton of baggage and some of the best (and most horrifying) scenes are of them just trying to work through their emotions. Tony Colette is outstanding, and Milly Shapiro as the daughter has the perfect look for the film. Somehow though it didn't quite stick the landing, which just seemed simplistic and a bit of a letdown, especially based on the film's hype. Loved some of the visual touches, e.g. the camera descending vertically beneath the ground when a casket is lowered. I just wish it all could have tied together a little differently.",7,1,2,29 January 2020
Casablanca," Romantic, gritty, stoic, larger than life, and epic
","There's not really much one can add all of the comments about this film, a masterpiece that is truly deserving of being in the list of top movies of all time. The story is perfectly crafted, intersecting a love triangle with the crushing pressures of wartime, and It's perfectly told by Director Michael Curtiz, with a flashback, a few surprises, and not a single wasted shot. Most importantly, the film captures the feeling of those huge moments in life that we'll always remember, where everything in one's life pivots, as well as the pain of love lost. Bogart holding that note in the rain, the ink beginning to run down as he's urged to get on the train, is later mirrored by him watching the plane disappear into the fog, the signal light reducing to a pinprick, and both moments are incredibly poignant.The cast is also outstanding – Bogart and Bergman of course, but also almost all of the supporting characters. Claude Rains as the Vichy French captain whose loyalties sway in the wind is my personal favorite. In a sweeping story that could have easily been cloying or corny, there is great realism in characters who are morally ambivalent (Rains, Lorre, and Bogart himself) put next to those who are willing to sacrifice themselves for a good cause, and those bent on taking over the world. There are many wonderful scenes, and not just those between Bogart and Bergman. Paul Henreid is great with Bergman too, and the scene where he leads the French ex-pats in singing 'La Marseillaise' to drown out the German officers singing their own patriotic is rousing. And let's not forget Dooley Wilson, who is so smooth, singing among other things the iconic 'As Time Goes By'. This film is romantic, gritty, stoic, larger than life, and epic - and one that I never get tired of seeing.",10,2,2,29 November 2017
Minority Report," Entertaining blockbuster
","Great concept, one with themes of predeterminism vs. free will, as well as the use of advanced technology to fight crime with the drawbacks of loss of privacy and potential for abuse. There are some pretty cool moments, but overall it's flawed in execution; you'll have to suspend disbelief too many times, and there are lots of groan-inducing moments. Maybe the biggest one for me is Tom Cruise's character weepily saying 'I want him back so bad' in a scene about his son, and there are several others where Spielberg should have trusted his actors to deliver emotions nonverbally, instead of having them say cheesy lines.For my taste, the film would have been better pared down and darker both visually and in tone. Think of what it could have been if it had focused more on the weightier philosophical or police state aspects, as opposed to settling for the sentimentality of a personal story amidst an excessive number of plot twists. Think of the possibilities for an ending with either a skyrocketing murder rate or an injustice, something ambiguous or chilling. Think of what it might have been like delivered ala Blade Runner (1982), which was also based on a Philip K. Dick story.With that said, Spielberg targets a blockbuster popcorn movie and there's a certain appeal to that, and it's reasonably entertaining. I also loved seeing 73-year-old Max von Sydow.",7,1,1,4 April 2020
To Be or Not to Be," Ah, Lubitsch
","Only Ernst Lubitsch could have balanced all of the aspects of this film and had it come out right. He satirizes the Nazis without diminishing the evil they represented, delivers a comedy amidst the light drama of a resistance movement, and adds a little element of romance besides. The timing for the film was extraordinary; while it was being shot America had not yet entered the war, and before it was released, Carole Lombard had tragically died at age 33. The film opens a troupe of Polish actors rehearsing a play satirizing the Nazis in August, 1939, a month before the invasion, and it was highly topical at the time.Lombard is simply radiant in her last film, and finds the right restraint and touch between comedy and cooing out double entendres. Jack Benny is funny in the role of her husband, a ham actor whose wife begins talking to an ardent admirer in her dressing room when he begins Hamlet's soliloquy. The other man (Robert Stack) is a Polish airman who soon sweeps them up into an effort to stop a spy within the resistance's ranks.As always Lubitsch treats his viewers with such respect, letting us connect the dots without hitting us over the head with explanations or plodding along linearly. His humor is so clever, and varies between an actor raising an eyebrow which the audience will know the meaning of, and things like the repeated line 'So they call me Concentration Camp Ehrhardt?'. He also gets in a lot of jabs at the idiocy of the fascists, the most memorable being when two Nazis are told to jump out of a plan without parachutes and do so with a couple of Heil Hitler's and no questions asked. There are also moments that are quite touching, such as the Jewish member of the company quoting 'The Merchant of Venice' ('If you prick us do we not bleed? If you tickle us do we not laugh? If you poison us do we not die?').My favorite lines were the sly repartee from Carole Lombard to elude the Production Code:
Stanislav: You might not believe it, but I can drop three tons of dynamite in two minutes.
Maria: Really?
Stanislav: Does that interest you?
Maria: It certainly does.Siletsky: Shall we drink to a blitzkrieg?
Maria: I prefer a slow encirclement.",8,2,3,19 February 2019
Monty Python's Life of Brian," Razor sharp, and still holds up
","Marvelous satire of religion and its followers - how the message is distorted, how factions invariably form and fight one another, and how blind worship quickly replaces reason (and even kindness). After the Sermon on the Mount is delivered to a crowd who mostly can't hear Jesus and squabble among themselves, one guy walks off commenting 'What Jesus fails to appreciate is that it's the meek who are the problem,' in shades of the conservative view in 1979 and today. Mostly it's just good, sacrilegious fun, sometimes venturing into territory that's now frowned upon (like making fun of a speech impediment), but overall very creative and intelligent. Here's another funny bit:Brian: Look, you've got it all wrong! You don't need to follow me! You don't need to follow anybody! You've got to think for yourselves! You're all individuals!
Crowd, as one: Yes! We're all individuals!
Brian: You're all different!
Crowd, as one: Yes, we're all different!",8,1,5,16 May 2020
The Death of Stalin," Funny, but too dark in places
","You know you've touched a nerve and are on to something when the country your satire is set in bans the film. It's a great cast and there are lots of amusing moments, but I confess it was tough for me to truly love this one, probably because of the subject matter and its overall tone. Some aspects of the comedy are hilarious - the deference to the supreme leader in some scenes, and the various jockeying for power in others - but there is quite a bit that is not, e.g. the murder depictions and rape references. I would have liked it better as a farce without these elements because of just how horrifying the actual history is, or as a more factual historical drama.",7,0,0,30 July 2019
Citizen Kane," Brilliant - and devastating
","In this film we see the arc of a wealthy man's life from childhood memories to his aspirations after college, from wielding power in the middle of life to an end that, amidst vast wealth and opulence, simply looks back on childhood, and then goes up in smoke. Charles Foster Kane (Orson Welles) may have been based on William Randolph Hearst and the film a critique of the 'rich and powerful', but there are elements it that are also universal. It takes a piercing look into how people change over time, how power corrupts, and how all life is transient. Kane may have all of the benefits that money brings, but he's also a little broken inside, with perhaps a narcissistic or attachment disorder stemming from having been given up for adoption by his own biological parents when he was a boy (and that, in turn, hinted as being due to his father's abuse). He therefore has no real friends, or true love. He positions himself as a 'man of the people', but he's aloof and above them from all, using them to amplify his own power. He may collect all of the statues he can find in Europe for his castle in America, but ultimately dies like anyone else, without any real meaning, and his possessions disbursed. It's fascinating to watch Kane evolve over the film. His days as a young man are full of hubris and the desire to run a newspaper, mainly to push social messages. While he also has a knack for increasing circulation via sensationalism, he's also pure enough to pen a 'Declaration of Principles' that promises to publish truth, free of special interests. In a fantastic exchange, his friend Jedediah (Joseph Cotten) points out that his first two sentences have started with the word 'I', and as we'll see, the 'special interest group' that Kane sells out to is Kane himself. He gradually morphs to begin abusing the power he has as a publisher, swaying opinions on war, and flat out saying that the people will think what he tells them to think.Kane's relationships also evolve in interesting ways. Early on he seems so close with Jedediah, jovial and dancing at office parties, but he fires him without thinking twice about it when Jedediah dares to publish the truth in a review of his second wife's awful performance at the opera. In a parallel way, we see this second wife (Dorothy Comingore) go from a humble, nice, and honest woman he meets on the street one night to a spoiled and vindictive wife, then bitter alcoholic. She speaks about Kane over a drink in a two-bit club, and Jedediah speaks about him from an assisted living facility. The film has a rather dark view of the endgame that awaits us all.The transience of life is further emphasized by little moments in the supporting cast, such as Bernstein (Everett Sloane) saying of his own life these fantastic lines: 'A fellow will remember a lot of things you wouldn't think he'd remember. You take me. One day, back in 1896, I was crossing over to Jersey on the ferry, and as we pulled out, there was another ferry pulling in, and on it there was a girl waiting to get off. A white dress she had on. She was carrying a white parasol. I only saw her for one second. She didn't see me at all, but I'll bet a month hasn't gone by since that I haven't thought of that girl.'Orson Welles is excellent as both actor and director, and the way the story is told, via flashbacks from multiple perspectives and short jumps in time, is compelling. He also utilizes a number of innovative and interesting visual techniques that feel modern. If you're looking for a film with an uplifting message, one with action, or one that will leave you feeling warm, this is not your film. On the other hand, there is such honesty here about power and about life, the filmmaking is fantastic, and it has an ending that is absolutely devastating, in those plumes of smoke going up into the night sky.",9,3,3,9 October 2018
Memento," Creative story-telling
","Creative story-telling, interesting mystery, and I liked the payoff at the end. I thought it took a little too long to get there and was repetitive in its overlapping bits, so I got a little less caught up in the cleverness of it all than others. Part of me felt it was too contrived, and part of me wondered why the main character didn't just take copious notes rather than scrawl single lines on photos and tattoo himself, or better yet, shoot videos of himself. How could he be functional on his own, driving, etc in this state? How does he even remember that he has a memory problem? The reverse story-telling is intricate, maybe too much so, or maybe some of it was just lost on me. I just felt it was a decent film, with an average plot, performances, and cinematography, but told in a creative way.",7,1,2,10 February 2020
Au Revoir les Enfants," Brilliant
","'More than 40 years have passed, but I'll remember every second of that January morning until the day I die.'Part of what makes this autobiographical film from Louis Malle so powerful is that a big portion of its coming of age material is universal. In a Catholic boarding school we see hazing and random bullying while ineffectual headmasters look the other way, bedwetting, reading after hours, playground battles, curiosity about girls, and the kind of childhood events that get remembered for life, like getting lost in the woods. In other words, it's just boys trying to get through the difficulties of growing up, and really could be any group of boys, at any time.But of course this isn't just any period, it's occupied France during WWII, and while the school full of affluent kids seems mostly insulated from that, danger lurks. Three new boys who have been admitted and given new names are secretly Jews, a fact which gradually becomes known by Julien, one of the smarter students (Gaspard Manesse, playing the young Malle). He has a rivalry and a friendship with one of the new boys (played soulfully by Raphaël Fejtö), and the nuances of their relationship not only felt authentic, but it made it hard to know how the film would play out.I love the dimensions of the film, including the differing Catholic responses to the Jewish issue in Vichy France - some good, some bad. There is also an axis of rich/poor, and I loved the sermon where the priest shocks the visiting parents by criticizing the behavior of the wealthy. Lastly, the use of the Chaplin film 'The Immigrant' (1917) within the film is pitch perfect, and a masterful touch.",9,1,1,14 April 2019
Stripes," It was better in 1981
","A movie that starts off strong, with lots of little humor between Bill Murray and Harold Ramis in the way they talk to one another and see humor in the face of life's struggles, and then on a whim join the army. The early scenes in boot camp are good too, with help from John Candy and others in the supporting cast. Unfortunately the film descends from that point on, first via gratuitous nudity and objectifying scenes that go on for far too long. The way the female MP's behave is cringe-worthy, and not redeemed by their heroism towards the end. The second step down is in the rescue sequence from Czechoslovakia, most of which is silly and worse, it's not all that funny either. For all the talent of Murray and Ramis, two guys I love, I have to say, this one hasn't aged well.",6,4,6,9 July 2019
12 Angry Men," Outstanding
","A film whose action takes almost completely in the deliberation room of a jury may sound as if it's going to be awfully dry or uninteresting, but on the contrary, '12 Angry Men' is powerful and stirring, with real tension, fantastic characters, and great dialogue. It probes into the American judicial system, and in a larger sense, the human condition. I couldn't recommend it more highly.As a jury of twelve retire to reach a verdict in a murder trial on a sweltering day in New York, it's clear that most - in fact, eleven of them - believe the evidence against the accused is overwhelming. To me it's notable that early on, the lone holdout (Henry Fonda) isn't making all sorts of arguments as to why the defendant isn't guilty: he simply wants to make sure they proceed carefully and talk it through. He empathizes with the defendant's difficult upbringing not because he thinks it's relevant to the charges or a defense in and of itself, but because he's a decent guy who senses a rush to judgment, and perhaps most importantly, senses a bias in the room against one of 'those kinds of kids' from the slums. What follows from there is a tour de force in critical thinking, rational discourse, and civility - all of the best things about mankind, and which save us from injustice and the mob.While the film is taut and focused on this single trial - and only this aspect of the trial - it has a number of larger messages. First and foremost, it tells us that wisdom never needs to shout. Patience and silence are powerful. There are such lessons here in how to interact with others in calm, respectful, and yet assertive ways - even when tempers flare, things get personal, or when one has to stand up to a bully with a big mouth. In one of my favorite moments, when a bigoted juror (Ed Begley) is going on about 'those kind of people' in clearly prejudiced ways, his fellow jurors quietly get up and turn their backs on him to show their disdain, and even those who agree with his vote do not support him. In another great rebuke, when Begley asks the immigrant watchmaker (George Voskovec) why he's being so polite, he responds 'For the same reason you are not; it's the way I was brought up.'The film also affirms the importance of the American justice system, and by extension, other countries with trial by jury in one form or another. Flawed though it may be, the concept that one must be found guilty beyond a reasonable doubt by a jury of one's peers, and that the decision must be unanimous - that it's better to let a guilty man go free than to convict an innocent man - is fundamental to a functioning democracy. How fantastic it is when Fonda's character states these points so simply and clearly. However, with that said, the film shows that this system only works when it's 'run' (or participated in) properly. Justice and democracy require thoughtful participation, and are not things to be dismissed quickly so that we can resume our lives, and in the case of Jack Warden's character, get on to the baseball game. It's a wonderful moment when Voskovec, otherwise relatively quiet, chastises him for his backward priorities while another man's life hangs in the balance. From these moments we can infer that the film is a criticism of those who avoid jury duty by pretending to show bias or conflict, and though it may be a stretch, you can apply this to other important civic duties as well, such as voting.It's to the film's credit that while there are a few who spew bigotry and bully others, everyone makes valid points about the evidence they've heard, including the loudmouths, and that's part of what makes it so gripping. Sifting through these points and reaching consensus is a big part of the film. The flow of the discussion is intelligent, with the natural questions or responses to an argument vocalized by one character or another. There is such rawness and realism in the dialogue, and we wrestle with the facts ourselves, and feel the weight of it all. We see the importance of rational, careful thought, but also the importance of understanding others, and not just the defendant or witnesses in the case, but the jurors themselves, who all have their own backgrounds, and in some cases, their own baggage.If all of this sounds too heavy or moralistic, I apologize, because it really isn't. The performance are natural and brilliant across the board. There are powerful emotional moments, but there is also humor peppered throughout the film. When Fonda's character queries Marshall's own ability to recall events from past evenings, we hear Warden quip in the background 'When you get to New Year's Eve 1954, let me know.' Before the advertising man (Robert Webber) puts forth an idea, he says 'Let's throw it out and see if the cat licks it up.' These types of lines not only make the characters more interesting, but they also add realism. It's telling to me that while Lee J. Cobb comes across as the 'rival' to Henry Fonda, and he is quite bombastic in several emotional moments, it's really the cold, factual juror (E.G. Marshall) who really needs to be swayed at the end, and it's a discussion of reason against reason. Cobb is the last juror to change his mind, but the final discussion is really between Marshall and Fonda. Marshall admits that Fonda has 'made some excellent points', but then reminds him of the eyewitness testimony, and then says 'what do you think?' Civility and decency are triumphing, and it's a metaphor for the only hope for man.The ending is absolutely brilliant, with the jurors returning into the streets to head back to their twelve separate lives, having performed their civic duty. Director Sidney Lumet shows incredible restraint to not then cut to 'what actually happened' on the night in question, or to a plot twist, or to some outcome good or bad (e.g. some of type of feel-good fanfare with the young defendant weeping tears of relief, or a horrifying realization Fonda has when he somehow finds out that he's let a killer go free, etc). There's none of that, and quite simply because they've done what they're meant to do, and justice has been served.",10,0,1,1 October 2018
"Crazy, Stupid, Love"," Sexist and without charm
","I'll pretty much watch Steve Carrell in anything, but this was creepy in several ways, starting with the lounge lizard (Ryan Gosling) being the wise guru and effortlessly bedding woman after woman (sorry, I don't care what his abs look like). The script lacks charm, and it's a waste of a lot of interesting actors (Emma Stone, Julianne Moore, Marisa Tomei). There's also one crazy, stupid plot twist you might say. The 13 year old and 17 year old characters are in there in a way that's far more disturbing than authentic, especially that gift of the nude photos that was absolutely god awful. Overall the film was so sexist that I felt like I needed a shower afterwards.",4,5,11,21 November 2019
Knives Out," Fun and entertaining
","'I spoke in the car about the hole at the center of this donut. And yes, what you and Harlan did that fateful night seems at first glance to fill that hole perfectly. A donut hole in the donut's hole. But we must look a little closer. And when we do, we see that the donut hole has a hole in its center - it is not a donut hole at all, but a smaller donut with its own hole, and our donut is not a hole at all.'This is a fun and entertaining murder mystery, with a little dash of political subtext. Don't go in expecting grand sociopolitical commentary (go in ignorant, like me, haha), and I think you'll enjoy how these little elements were added. First and foremost, the focus of the film is on the unraveling of a mystery, which director Rian Johnson does in a skillful way. The pace is great and it's a strong cast, even if the film doesn't really allow any of them to stand out too much. Personally I loved seeing Ana de Armas, Jamie Lee Curtis, and Michael Shannon amidst all the many others (Daniel Craig and his southern accent notwithstanding). The house and its furnishings are gorgeous, and the dialogue is sharply drawn. Despite having lots of characters and motivations, it finds a balance between immersing us gradually enough where we can keep track of who's who, and keeping things lively.As for the subtext, it's easy to think that the children and grandchildren of this wealthy mystery author stand for all wealthy Americans born with silver spoons in their mouths, but it may go further than that: they may stand for all Americans who feel a sense of entitlement to their birthright, and who have been spoiled by the fortunate situation they were born into. In other words, don't think that it's necessarily just a critique of the 1%. Regardless, I loved the different forms this took in the characters, and how in the end, even the more liberal or cool ones were out for themselves. It was also nice that through Don Johnson's character, we hear the other side of the argument, e.g. make immigrants do it legally, even if it's one I disagree with, since the process for immigrating legally is also under such attack. Whoops, I've veered off-topic for a film review, haven't I? Or maybe this is right on topic. Anyway, see the film if you're in the mood for something fun, it's a good one.",8,1,5,29 February 2020
Oldboy," Dark entertainment
","Absolutely brilliant in its first few scenes (and a damn good first hour), which set the tone for a wild ride and showcase director Park Chan-wook's impressive visual flair. The mystery of what's happening to this guy is intriguing, and as he himself tries to figure out, we get a very creative fight scene in the corridor (among lots of other things, cough, octopus). It's no wonder Tarantino liked this film so much, as its main theme is revenge, it goes for those big, squirm-inducing shock moments, and it's quite stylish. For me it fizzled a bit in the second half, as I saw more of the nemesis character and the story was revealed. Much as I tried to suspend disbelief (and not think too much about the misogyny), several big moments in the plot seemed contrived, and it seemed kind of messy, wanting focus. Still entertaining though, if you're in the mood for something dark.",7,0,0,6 March 2020
The Great Dictator," Outstanding
","Only Chaplin could deliver such a high level of humor and scathing satire in the same film, which was a beacon of light in a very dark time, and obviously on the right side of history. I love his humanity, courage, and vision in delivering this message at a time when America was wavering about entering WWII. There were lots of highlights:<ul><li>The on-point Hitler impression. Aside from the vocalization, throughout the movie we see Chaplin poking at the dictator's lack of intelligence, deep insecurity, and insane whims. There is also a steady stream of mockery of the Nazi war machine: the exaggerated march, overly vertical salute, inventions like the bullet-proof uniform and compact parachute, and plays on names, e.g. The 'Phooey' instead of The Fuhrer, Herr Herring as Goring, Minister of War, Herr Garbitsch as Goebbels, Minister of Propaganda, etc.</li></ul><ul><li>Hitler/Hynkel getting this advice, with the relevance to today's ugly turn in politics: 'I thought your reference to the Jews might have been more violent. We've got to rouse the people's anger. At this time, violence against the Jews might take the public's mind off its stomach.' And later: 'You might go a little further with the Jews - burn down some of their houses. A spectacular assault on their ghettos, now that might prove diverting.'</li></ul><ul><li>The satire in the line 'Brunettes are trouble makers. They're worse than the Jews,' and as the fascists dream about a blonde world, Herr Garbitsch slipping in that it would have 'a brunette dictator', which of course was an irony of Hitler's Aryan ideal despite his own looks.</li></ul><ul><li>The physical comedy, an example of which early on is in dropping a grenade down his sleeve as he tries to throw it, and later his understated reaction to finding out they're flying upside-down and out of gas. Later we see Hitler/Hynkel doing silly things like a ballet leap across the floor, followed by climbing the curtain and imitating Garbo's 'I want to be alone,' and also knocking that balloon globe around with his behind.</li></ul><ul><li>The Jewish barber being a veteran of WWI, and then also walking down the street in persona of The Tramp, both of which were reminders of the humanity of the Jewish people.</li></ul><ul><li>Paulette Goddard's character saying 'Do you believe in God? I do! But, if there wasn't one, would you live any different? I wouldn't.'</li></ul><ul><li>The shave to the music of Brahms (where Chuck Jones got the idea for the Bugs Bunny 'Rabbit of Seville' bit ten years later).</li></ul><ul><li>Commander Schultz: 'Your cause is doomed to failure because it's built on the stupid, ruthless persecution of innocent people. Your policy is worse than a crime. It's a tragic blunder!'</li></ul><ul><li>My God, that speech near the end. Absolutely stirring. The beginning of it is:</li></ul>'I'm sorry, but I don't want to be an emperor. That's not my business. I don't want to rule or conquer anyone. I should like to help everyone if possible; Jew, Gentile, black man, white. We all want to help one another. Human beings are like that. We want to live by each other's happiness, not by each other's misery. We don't want to hate and despise one another. In this world there is room for everyone, and the good earth is rich and can provide for everyone. The way of life can be free and beautiful, but we have lost the way. Greed has poisoned men's souls, has barricaded the world with hate, has goose-stepped us into misery and bloodshed. We have developed speed, but we have shut ourselves in. Machinery that gives abundance has left us in want. Our knowledge has made us cynical; our cleverness, hard and unkind. We think too much and feel too little. More than machinery, we need humanity. More than cleverness, we need kindness and gentleness. Without these qualities, life will be violent and all will be lost. The airplane and the radio have brought us closer together. The very nature of these inventions cries out for the goodness in men; cries out for universal brotherhood; for the unity of us all. Even now my voice is reaching millions throughout the world, millions of despairing men, women, and little children, victims of a system that makes men torture and imprison innocent people. To those who can hear me, I say, do not despair. The misery that is now upon us is but the passing of greed, the bitterness of men who fear the way of human progress. The hate of men will pass, and dictators die, and the power they took from the people will return to the people. And so long as men die, liberty will never perish.'",9,3,3,30 May 2019
Ed Wood," An odd but touching couple
","I'm usually not a fan of films that celebrate incompetence and I don't think I'd like Ed Wood's actual films, but this movie about him was very well made and quite entertaining. Johnny Depp is brilliant as the 'worst director of all time,' and Martin Landau gives us a very touching portrait of Bela Lugosi in his final years, relegated to bad movies and addicted to drugs. This odd couple's chemistry together is special, and there is a charm to Wood assembling a cast out of other misfits and people he happens upon. The fact that he was openly a transvestite and explains that this doesn't equate to homosexuality was a great thing for 1994.Burton made a great decision by using black and white, and he keeps this thing moving along with a pace that matches Wood's frenetic style. I think he probably glamorizes Wood a little bit, maybe because he was a fan and saw a parallel to himself, but it's not overdone. Contrast Wood's enthusiasm with one of the low-budget producers he runs across early on, who says 'I make crap' and simply wants to make money - there are real comments about the motion picture business in all the fun and celebration of cult films. That rises to a crescendo when Orson Welles (Vincent D'Onofrio) improbably tells Wood 'Visions are worth fighting for. Why spend your life making someone else's dreams?' I would be more inspired if it was the story of someone with more talent, but I was touched by the man's optimism and spirit nonetheless.",8,0,0,22 April 2020
Juno," Smart, funny, and many positive messages
","Full disclosure, I would probably see Ellen Page and Jason Bateman in anything, I love them both so much. Page is of course in the starring role here, and delivers an outstanding performance as the quirky Juno, a high school who finds herself pregnant after spontaneous sex with her nerdy friend (Michael Cera). The film is very well made, with clever dialog and composed of countless little moments that are amusing, despite dealing with a serious subject. Juno resolves to give the baby up for adoption to a yuppie couple played by Jason Bateman and Jennifer Garner, but things get complicated with Bateman's character begins getting close to her because of their interests in rock music and slasher films, kindling long-standing desires on his part to do more in life before becoming a father.This is a very well-cast movie from top to bottom. J.K. Simmons plays Juno's father who is generally kind and supportive, but expresses his disappointment by saying 'I thought you were the kind of girl who knew when to say when'. Page's facial reaction, followed by her response, 'I don't really know what kind of girl I am' is priceless, and just one of many great scenes for her. Allison Janney plays her step-mom, and has a powerful moment telling off the ultrasound technician while sticking up for Juno, and then later quipping 'doctors are sadists who like to play God and watch lesser people scream'. Cera plays awkward teenage dorkiness naturally, and Olivia Thirlby turns in a solid performance as Juno's friend.This is a 'teenage film' that is smart, and has so many positive messages; it's accepting of unorthodox kids and difficult situations, which everyone deals with as Juno does, with humor and head up high. It's an empowering film, and a love story. The scene of Cera and Page strumming guitars and singing 'Anyone Else But You' (by The Moldy Peaches) is a sweet ending and caps off a nice alternative/indie soundtrack. Page really established herself with this film, and is well worthy of the Academy Award nomination she received.",8,4,4,27 May 2016
Midnight in Paris," Lovely
","Highlights:
<ul><li>Gorgeous shot of Paris, making the film practically a love letter to the city.</li><li>Whimsical story-telling of magically going back to the Années folles (and La Belle Époque).</li><li>The central message, that we're a little silly to look back on earlier eras as more preferable, that the present is 'a little unsatisfying because life is a little unsatisfying' ... and also, how history repeats itself in this regard, with each age looking back at the past. It's ironic that it's the annoying pedantic guy (Michael Sheens) who points out the fallacy of 'golden-age thinking' first.</li><li>All of the cultural references and characterization of artists, authors, filmmakers etc., which tickled me. Kathy Bates as Gertrude Stein stands out.</li><li>Beautiful soundtrack.</li><li>Sweet ending. Léa Seydoux is lovely.</li><li>This line: 'By the way, it's fine for your father and I to disagree. That's what a democracy is. Your father defends the right-wing of the Republican Party, and I happen to think you've almost got to be, like, a demented lunatic ... But it doesn't mean we don't respect each other's views, am I right?' ... which so perfectly skewers both the far right and polarization in politics.</li></ul>Lowlights:
<ul><li>Some of the characters, like the fiancé (Rachel McAdams) and Ernest Hemingway (Tom Hiddleston), are rather extreme.</li><li>Many shots in Paris seemed cast in a warmer than normal color tint, making them look unnatural.</li></ul>",9,0,0,13 September 2019
Zodiac," Solid dramatization
","A pretty compelling account of the Zodiac killer and ensuing investigation over decades. It's long, almost too long, but it matches just how drawn out the case was, and allows for all sorts of little details, the fleshing out of the people involved, and the eeriness of never really knowing to unfold. The names and places sometimes fly fast and furious, but the story is well told in many ways, starting with what the frustration does to the monomaniacal police and reporters looking into it. Mostly it feels like a mental thriller, but damn, that basement scene is truly scary. The circumstantial case against Arthur Leigh Allen is well laid out, and to me it was pretty surprising that he eluded more aggressive investigation and arrest, e.g. the amount of time between the testimony of Donald Cheney and the first search warrant, but of course, that's with the benefit of hindsight. Jake Gyllenhaal, Mark Ruffalo, Robert Downey Jr., and Anthony Edwards all do well here, and this a very solid dramatization.",8,1,2,16 March 2020
The Hateful Eight," Good but not great
","All of Quentin Tarantino movies are fun to watch, and I can always feel his appreciation of filmmaking as a craft as well as his joy in film as pure entertainment. The setup to 'Hateful Eight' is fantastic, with beautiful outdoor shots in snow country, and an interesting concept, characters being added one by one as a bounty hunter stops to pick up those imperiled by an oncoming blizzard. Tarentino assembles a fine cast with Kurt Russell, Samuel L. Jackson, Jennifer Jason Leigh among others, and Bruce Dern turns in a great performance. There are some deep moments amidst the violence, Jackson saying in one scene that 'The only time black folks are safe, is when white folks is disarmed', and Tim Roth's character expressing the thin line justice walks in a speech ending with the line 'For justice delivered without dispassion is always in danger of not being justice' in another. I liked how the stories behind each of the characters are gradually revealed, and how the story behind what happened earlier in the haberdashery that everyone is holed up in is told in a flashback chapter. In other words, there's a lot to like here. And yet. And yet. How the story plays out was somehow not completely satisfying, maybe because I felt like it lost focus, and fell back on extreme gore and graphic moments to try to carry the day. I was also not a huge fan of the ending. It's a good film for sure, but not great, or Tarantino's best.",7,1,3,11 January 2017
Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid," A fun film, and refreshing take on a Western
","Gorgeous scenery, big stars in Paul Newman and Robert Redford, and a different take on the Western genre all add up to an enjoyable film. I liked how the pair weren't mythologized and didn't have all the answers, which humanizes them. Between the mistakes they make (like using an excessive amount of dynamite to blow a safe) and their banter ('Think ya used enough dynamite there, Butch?'), there is quite a bit of comedic value from beginning to end. As they're pursued by a posse clearly smarter and tougher than they are through terrain they think can't leave tracks, Butch Cassidy repeatedly asks 'Who are those guys?' and I thought it was great that the megastars in the film play vulnerable characters on the run for so long. On top of that Butch Cassidy (Newman) admits he's never shot a man, and the Sundance Kid (Redford) admits he doesn't know how to swim. I don't think I've seen Redford give a better performance either. One thing that didn't work for me was the soundtrack from Burt Bacharach. While I think it was meant to go with the modern take on the Western, the 'Raindrops Keep Fallin' on my Head' tune played while Newman clowns around on a bike was shockingly bad to me. Katharine Ross is mostly wasted in the role of the lover the two seem to share, as not much is made with her character. Overall though, a fun film, and a good one for people who are less into traditional Westerns.",8,2,2,3 November 2019
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," Brilliant
","Marvelous satire from Kubrick, and one that clicks on all cylinders - visually beautiful, lots of funny moments, and sharp commentary on the military, cold war, and threat of nuclear annihilation. A perfect encapsulation of the period, and yet ahead of its time as well. Brilliant performances from Peter Sellers in his three roles, George C. Scott, and Slim Pickens. The imagery is so biting - that cowboy hat, 'peace is our profession', and the third reich salutes. The sexual overtones throughout the film add another layer of commentary, starting with the plane refueling and in many references to virility, signaling an aspect that has always been part of the military and those who would make war (perhaps the ultimate 'toxic masculinity' ... and making me think of the George Carlin bit about it not being manly to 'pull out' of Vietnam).We see the risk to humanity from our own selves in various 'big' ways - someone going rogue, the depraved indifference over 'only' 10-20 million dying, and the irrational fear of the other side being ahead, of there being any kind of 'gap.' We also see it in our little foibles, like pettiness, jealousy, and lust, and in the ignorant belief in conspiracy theories like that around fluoridation (which was a real thing). And interestingly, we also see the risk to humanity from automation and computers getting into an irreversible, destructive state, perhaps prefetching HAL in 2001, and the concerns of AI decades later. Mostly of all though, it points out the idiocy of the arms race, prompted by living in fear - messages which are still so important today - and it does this in way that is both delightfully over the top, but also includes the essence of truth.",9,4,5,19 April 2019
Pan's Labyrinth," Entertaining, but didn't quite live up to the hype
","Entertaining and has lots of visual pop, but didn't quite live up to everything I had heard about it (this was my first time watching it, and I had always been interested). It's kind of a strange intersection, with the fairytale elements put alongside brutal violence and torture, but I think that was part of the point, the innocence lost in war and for Spain under the Franco regime. In the blend of fantasy and reality, I thought the fantasy elements worked better, and I wish there had been more of them. I loved the dreamy feeling of the child from the 'other world' and my favorite part was the Pale Man; the visuals are fantastic in that scene and I loved the Goya reference. The other half of the movie with the resistance fighters is decent, but not as strong as it could have been. It needed more nuance; the captain is cartoonishly evil and the plot is suspect at key points (e.g. a moment when it defies logic for someone not to kill him). I think the weak link here is unfortunately in the writing, as the story and characters are pretty simple.",7,2,3,8 April 2019
Begin Again," It works in quiet ways
","Mark Ruffalo is great as a down and out music producer, a believer in independent music and co-founder of his own label, but who loses his job because of his excessive drinking. He's divorced with a teenage daughter, and feels her (and his ex-wife's) disrespect for him grow as he sinks to rock bottom. The scene where he stumbles across Keira Knightly, an aspiring young singer-songwriter performing solo in a small bar, and in his mind adds the music which could accompany it, is very nice; she thinks she's bombed based on the tepid reaction from the audience in the bar, whereas he sees her talent and begins pursuing her. Her boyfriend is Adam Levine, who has already become a successful artist, though they fight when he steals one of her songs for his album. It's a scene played quite well by both of them.The movie has a nice soundtrack, including 'Coming Up Roses' by Keira Knightly and 'Lost Stars' by Adam Levine. Knightly is good as a singer and Levine and CeeLo Green (in a smaller role) are good as actors, and Hailee Steinfeld, Ruffalo's character's daughter, is a solid young talent. The movie has an authentic feel to it, with shots in New York City's subways and streets that I enjoyed. It moves towards an ending which is mostly predictable I suppose, but in a heartfelt way, and with a few digs at the music industry along the way. It's not a masterpiece or anything, but it works in quiet ways.",8,0,0,1 May 2016
The Best Years of Our Lives," Harold Russell is a revelation
","America's love letter to servicemen returning from the war, speaking their truths, and hoping to earn them more appreciation, understanding, and patience. From the beginning we feel something is altered these guys (Frederic March, Dana Andrews, and Harold Russell), starting with Russell's dramatic reveal of missing his hands, and continuing on with all of their difficulties readjusting. In some sense they seem to be misfits in a country that they fought for and saved, and even though they are widely shown some level of respect, at times it feels like lip service, and that the country was ready to move on just a little too quickly.In ways that are not heavy-handed, the film touches on things that survivors of the war faced, like marital problems, having missed children grow up, alcoholism, night terrors, survivor's guilt, the difficulty of getting a job or a loan, and in one scene, putting up with a loudmouth who questions why they fought in the first place, and didn't just put America First.There are several touching moments: a father reading his son's commendation, the one the young man would just as soon throw away. March's sharp speech defending giving loans at risk to soldiers, cleverly pointing out the risks they took doing things like taking a hill during the war (they couldn't say 'no collateral, no hill'), and that the bank was betting on America's future. Andrews walking out into a graveyard of scrapped war planes, and climbing up into one. And lastly, Harold Russell showing his girlfriend his body and making sure she understood the limits of his situation.Russell is simply a revelation in this film and deserves special mention out of the strong cast - and I mean that because of his acting. He brings an earnestness and authenticity to the part across a full range - stoicism, dignity, friendly camaraderie, grief, and anger.Three of the female characters are absolute saints (Myrna Loy, Teresa Wright, and Cathy O'Donnell), and almost too saccharine sweet in their wholesomeness. When Andrews says to Wright, 'I think they oughtta put you in mass production,' he's probably got it right. Part of all this was undoubtedly the Production Code, and part of it was meant to impart a lesson in kindness and understanding of soldiers returning with physical or mental damage. They are offset a little by Virginia Mayo, the bad girl who shakes her hips while wrapping a scarf around her behind and soon tires of not living the high life on her husband's small salary. Per the morality of the Code he's expected to stick with her despite loving Wright, because as Myrna Loy's character articulates it to her daughter, in a marriage you go through trials and tribulations and even hating the other person, and are expected to just get through it. Of course all of the badness is assigned to Mayo's character, who conveniently exits the scene to ensure things will play out happily.While the film touches on the darker aspects of returning from war, it's also got that bright, squeaky-clean 1950's American feeling to it, and could certainly have been darker. At the same time, it initiated the conversation on these issues, and it almost certainly helped people heal, and for those things it deserves the credit it's received over the years.Lastly, I liked the foreboding touches that occurred early on, alluding to the horrifying new era mankind had entered. As a high school boy has learned from his physics teacher, 'We've reached a point where the whole human race has either got to find a way to live together, or else...' The point is later echoed by a piano player in the bar (Hoagy Carmichael), who is advocating patience to Russell's character because he's struggling. He softly says some of the best lines in the movie: 'You know your folks will get used to you, and you'll get used to them, then everything will settle down nicely. Unless we have another war. Then none of us have to worry because we'll all be blown to bits the first day. So cheer up, huh?'",9,1,1,29 April 2019
Battleship Potemkin," Worth watching, but suffers from being a propaganda film
","A lot of people note that director Sergei Eisenstein was ahead of his time with his 'film montage' technique, used so effectively in the massacre scene on the steps of Odessa, but it should also be noted that he captures brilliant images throughout this movie. It's certainly worth watching as a result, and is probably a must for students of film. However, what undoubtedly stirred emotions in 1925 – possibly sympathy for the communist movement, or fear of inciting revolutionary thoughts given the mutiny that takes place on the Potemkin, or squeamishness at the moments of violence (all of which contributed to the film being banned in many countries, including the Soviet Union!) – is less impactful ninety years later. It also suffers for being a propaganda film, with less nuance in its characters and plot.",7,0,1,1 December 2016
Taxi Driver," Disturbing
","Fantastic filmmaking, an outstanding cast, and cinematography that manages to be artistic and elevating, and yet also captures the grime and filth of New York City's seedier areas in the 1970's. Seriously, I felt like I needed a shower afterwards. That's also because the film is dark, and in several ways. It has an anti-hero who is a disturbed, pathetic loner. Child prostitution. Scenes that seem to glorify guns and violence. And an awful ending (and no, I'm not buying the dream theory). I believe it's all meant to be a brutal (and realistic) indictment of America, but it seems to me it also revels a bit in the mire of this grim world, and ironically glorifies some of the very things it's critiquing. I loved the shots of New York at night, and the effects with light, such as when they come through the back of the taxicab out of focus. I thought Jodie Foster at 14 was brilliant, and Robert De Niro ('You talkin' to me?') was as well. I admire Scorsese the artist, but this one was too disturbing for me to want to see again (though I said the same thing when I first saw it years ago). Poke around and see how many people view Travis Bickle as a hero, instead of seeing in him what isolation, failure, frustration, and mental illness inevitably lead to, and you may get an idea of what I mean.",7,1,2,28 March 2019
Lost in Translation," Lost in Transition
","Transitions in life are stressful, and it seems to me that what this film is really about is being 'Lost in Transition.' A middle-aged actor (Bill Murray at 53) is in Japan to do a whiskey commercial against his better judgment to do something more meaningful with his time, when he meets a young woman (Scarlett Johansson at 18) who is recently married to a photographer and involved with the glitzy world of show business. Johansson's character doesn't really know what she wants to do in life with her philosophy degree, and isn't really sure she fits in with the people her husband works with. Murray's is disillusioned with the choices he's made in life, and mostly just wants to score a big payday with the commercial and then get home, at least until he meets her.It's all a little strange with these two people so far apart in age, meeting in a cheesy hotel bar and somehow connecting, as they sense a genuine person on the other end of their initial awkwardness. Being in Japan, jet-lagged, and with all of the quirky cultural things surrounding them adds to the surreal bubble that the two find themselves in, and they know they're like ships passing in the night, both in where they're heading in life, and their ages. I love how director Sofia Coppola used restraint in what they do with their time, in particular, holding back on physical intimacy, and even holding back on letting us hear what he whispers into her ear in a big moment. Not only does it feel incredibly real, but it also heightens the magic they somehow have, and makes it all the more beautiful and tragic.Coppola also gives the viewer some fantastic shots in streets and clubs of Japan, evoking a sense of what it's like to be there as a foreigner. I truly wish she and Murray had not used the 'R' and 'L' crap as much as they did, as it's such an insulting stereotype and an unoriginal cliché besides, so unfortunately there are some bits that are problematic. Aside from that I loved the film because of the great performances from both lead actors, Coppola's direction, and that devastating ending.",9,0,0,21 August 2019
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," Entertaining, but flawed
","There is so much pent-up rage over the handling of rape, and police behavior in general, that I think Frances McDormand's character in this film really struck a chord with people. She's on a crusade for her daughter who was raped and killed, and yet no progress has been made in the investigation. She doesn't care who she offends, she won't be intimidated into silence, and she'll stand up for herself in some violent ways. In an interesting twist, the police chief (Woody Harrelson) has pancreatic cancer, so aside from being called out on his investigation, he's dealing with that. The scene McDormand and Harrelson have in an interrogation room, and a specific moment of that is easily the film's best. Harrelson provides a voice of wisdom in the film, and the three letters he pens are also quite touching. There is humor as well, in just how boneheaded one of the policemen (Sam Rockewell) is, and the gem of a moment when Peter Dinklage, otherwise largely wasted, utters the line 'Penelope said 'begets'?', in a subtle burn of the 19-year-old now dating McDormand's ex-husband.The film started strong, but along the way started losing me. It suffers artistically from a lack of restraint, and everything seems exaggerated. The profanity. The characters, who start becoming cartoonish. The level of violence. The coincidences. It seems to me that McDonagh's writing is a real issue here. Her last words to her daughter were 'I hope you get raped,' really? To leave that in the script is egregiously bad, and an insult to the viewer's intelligence. The Molotov cocktails, really? The guy being in the station to begin with, and of course wearing ear buds, really? A man thrown out of a window, and no arrest, really? And on and on, until an ending which is pretty awful if you think about it. It's just tough to appreciate the message of the film or its cast in light of all this. It was entertaining to watch, but in my humble opinion, not worthy of all the acclaim.",6,3,5,29 August 2018
The Passion of Joan of Arc," Watch it for Dreyer's craft and Falconetti's performance
","Director Carl Theodor Dreyer created a unique experience with this film, employing low camera angles, unique editing, and a ton of tight shots on his actors to get an intensity of emotion from them, Maria Falconetti (as Jeanne d'Arc) in particular. The story focuses on just her trial and execution, which has the advantage that it makes the film taut and Kafkaesque, but the disadvantage that additional context would have told a richer story. Do we really see Jeanne d'Arc here? I'm not so sure, historical transcript notwithstanding, though I did find it fascinating that she refused to change out of her men's clothing. While performances are strong and the film is ahead of its time, the content is dark, and not particularly uplifting, especially if you're a non-believer. There is of course a universal theme in a righteous person standing up to persecution - being mocked, threatened, and tortured - but at the end of the day, it's simple Jeanne, believing she was sent by God, standing up against the established clergy, who, threatened by her assertions, believe she was sent by the Devil. The film never ponders whether both may be deluded, and concludes with her soul being protected by the flames as it rises to heaven. Watch this one for Dreyer's craft and Falconetti's performance.",8,2,3,8 June 2018
Fargo," Brilliant
","Brilliant. The film's idiosyncratic characters, with their northern Minnesota accents and mannerisms, are truly memorable and infinitely quotable. Frances McDormand, William H. Macy, and Steve Buscemi are all in career roles, and the supporting cast (including the chilling Peter Stormare) are great too. The cinematography is excellent and I loved the shots on location, which brought back memories; it's striking and makes the film feel authentic. The pace of the film, it's story-telling, dry humor, little observations, and surprise moments all make it highly entertaining even after repeat watches. Gotta love Marge Gunderson (McDormand) too - in her simple and nice way, she's canny, persistent, sensitive, and brave. She does it all, pursuing killers, carrying a baby, tactfully fending off an old high school classmate's advances, and stroking her husband's ego in what is a lovely marriage. What a bright character she is for such a dark tale. Just beware that it's not a true story, despite what that silly opening title card says, which was one of the film's few mistakes.",9,0,0,6 July 2019
Notting Hill," Sweet and enchanting
","What a charming movie this is. This film and its pairing of Julia Roberts and Hugh Grant is right up there with the best romantic comedies of any time period, and it feels a bit like 'Roman Holiday'. Roberts turns in a fantastic performance, mixing the regal elements of her character with vulnerability, strength, and playfulness well. She hits all the right notes without overdoing it, keeping the feel of the movie light. Grant delivers perfect British witticisms and one-liners, and is highly lovable. His friends in the film, including his roommate (Rhys Ifans), are all brilliant and add humor and depth. There are also some nice scenes in the London itself. Certainly a target for cynics, but to me, sweet and enchanting.",9,0,1,27 December 2017
"Good Morning, Vietnam"," Williams is brilliant
","It's hard to imagine an actor more suited to a role than Robin Williams is to Adrian Cronauer in this film. He's wildly funny, subversive, and politically incorrect, but his humanity and heart really come through as well. My god, I miss him. Also funny is Bruno Kirby in his role as the not-funny Lieutenant who thinks he knows comedy. The film wisely avoided having Cronauer's relationship to the Vietnamese woman (Chintara Sukapatana) proceeding beyond friendship, which showed a level of maturity and respect in the script. More importantly, I loved how it managed to capture a sliver of the American experience in Vietnam, which gives the film a haunting, bittersweet feeling amidst all of Williams's electric improvisation. Great film.",9,1,1,4 July 2019
Baby Driver," Stylish, high octane, and fun
","Lots of action, cool moves, and kind of cute romantic thing between Ansel Elgort (The Fault in Our Stars) and Lily James (BBC version of War and Peace, which I absolutely loved). Eiza Gonzalez was pretty damn hot too. The soundtrack was hip and one to look up afterwards. It did get a little excessive with the violence towards the end, but all in all stylish, high octane, and fun.",8,2,5,28 July 2017
The Thing," Great setting, fantastic effects
","An intelligent and reasonably tight story set in a research outpost in Antarctica, where scientists have inadvertently dug up some form of parasitic, shapeshifting alien out of the ice. It quickly becomes a study in paranoia, where behavior amongst the men becomes a game as difficult as that chess match against the computer Kurt Russell has early on: if one of your colleagues may not be what he seems to be, what's the best move? Attempting to determine who it might be, and selectively isolating him? Destroying everyone so that you might survive? Attempting to use reason and science in a helter skelter, chaotic situation? I loved the setting and the very cool ways in which the thing manifests itself, which at the time seemed so excessive that it turned reviewers off, but which today appears highly creative and refreshing in light of modern CGI, at least for me. There may be a couple of moments when one wonders about character motivations and it's a pretty simple story, but the latter keeps it focused, and the pace of the film is good. Kurt Russell and Keith David stand out in the cast, which also includes A. Wilford Brimley and Donald Moffat.",8,3,5,3 January 2019
Split," Run of the mill suspense film
","James McAvoy turns in a strong performance here, adding some nice touches to the various personalities of his character(s), and is probably the best thing this film has going for it. Anya Taylor-Joy, Haley Lu Richardson, and Jessica Sula, the three teenage girls he abducts at the beginning of the film, are all reasonably good as well, and pretty besides. Maybe too pretty, as their casting and the plot feel a bit packaged. I liked the back-story of abuse and implication of going from one beast to another, and the line 'the broken are the more evolved', which will resonate with anyone who has suffered while growing up. M. Night Shyamalan is at least coherent in this movie, but in the end, he doesn't really add all that much to the genre. It all seems done before, and the one 'new' element, the 24th personality, wasn't all that interesting. I wasn't too jazzed about the concept of setting up the next film either. This is a run of the mill suspense film, which is a shame given McAvoy's performance.",6,1,3,9 February 2018
North by Northwest," Classic 'wrong man' film by Hitch at the height of his powers
","Classic Hitchcock tale of the 'wrong man'; a mild-mannered businessman (ultra-suave Cary Grant) is mistaken for a spy and kidnapped at the very beginning, and it's away we go from then on. There are so many great and iconic scenes in this film – the crop duster chase of course, and also those at the United Nations and Mount Rushmore. Hitchcock is brilliant and puts tension in scenes at each and every opportunity, as opposed to devolving a great script into silly chase scenes which lesser directors may have done. It feels like a more masterful 007 movie, and James Mason and Martin Landau are both outstanding as villains. I'm not wild about Eva Marie Saint and only feel real chemistry between her and Grant in the line 'Shall I climb up and tell you why?' in response to his wondering why she's so good to him, but the final shot of the train speeding into a tunnel was a nice bit of tongue in cheek symbolism from Hitchcock. Despite a long career he was still at the height of his powers, and in the following year would make Psycho.",9,2,4,30 March 2016
The Shining," Fantastic style
","I'm not sure why this one has never resonated with me quite as much as it does with so many others. I like it, and thought I might like it even more on what was probably my fifth viewing over the years, but it still didn't click to the next level. I love the stunning beginning sequence from the air with the car driving through beautiful mountain scenery, the brilliant dreamlike (or nightmare-like) ending sequence in the maze, the classic moments from Jack Nicholson ('Here's Johnny' and all that), and the horrifying moment when Shelley Duvall finds out that all he's been typing is 'All work and no play...' instead of cranking out the great American novel. Probably my favorite moment was when their boy has gone to the room to get a toy, and we see a shot of Nicholson both on the bed and in a mirror, calling him over. It's absolutely terrifying, because we know he's hurt the boy while drinking in the past, we know something evil is going on with this place, and we see him in that mirror, so perfectly placed in the shot. The style and the cinematography of the film are fantastic.I guess what holds me back a bit is either the original story from Stephen King, which seems a little overdone, or the direction from Stanley Kubrick, who gives us little nuance. I think it would have been better if it hadn't had all the backstory about the Indian burial site, the place being cursed, the former caretaker having axed his family, and the chef having a psychic connection with the little boy. He's really going to be out there in Florida, feel a disturbance in the Force or whatever, and then fly off to Colorado and drive out to what is supposed to be an inaccessible place? I know stripping all this out would have gutted the film and had King fans howling even more than they do as it is, but I wish it had just been the guy and his family out there for the winter, slowly going crazy, without all the other mumbo-jumbo. The twins are spooky, but the flood of blood from the elevator? I don't know. As it is, to fit all that in, or maybe because of the choices Kubrick made, the pace to insanity is awfully quick, too damn quick, whereas a slow path would have been more terrifyingly tense and real to me. On top of that, Nicholson's performance is memorable for sure, but jeez if only he would emote a little, you know? He should have dialed it down early, to tell the story of gradual descent into madness better, and to make the scenes towards the end more powerful.",7,1,1,27 August 2019
Judgment at Nuremberg," Fantastic acting, script, and direction in a thought-provoking movie
","Outstanding film. Star-studded with several fantastic performances. Highly emotional given the subject matter, but presented in a very intelligent, balanced way. I was struck at once by that, and by how well director Stanley Kramer gives us both sides of the argument – and avoids simply paying lip service to the defense of the German judges on trial. Maximilian Schell is brilliant as the defense attorney, well worthy of his Oscar, and is forceful and compelling in his arguments. There are also so many brilliant scenes. Spencer Tracy walking in the empty arena where the Nazi rallies were held, with Kramer focusing on the dais from which Hitler spoke. The testimony of Montgomery Clift and Judy Garland, both of whom are outstanding and should have gotten Oscars. Burt Lancaster in the role of one of the German judges, the one tortured by his complicity, knowing he and others are guilty. The devastating real film clips from the concentration camps, which are still spine tingling despite all we 'know' or have been exposed to. Marlene Dietrich as the German general's wife, haunted but expressing the German viewpoint, one time while people are singing over drinks. Her night stroll with Tracy, as she explains the words to one song, is touching. It just seemed like there was just one powerhouse scene after another, and the film did not seem long at all at three hours. Heck, you've even got Werner Klemperer and William Shatner before they would become Colonel Klink and Captain Kirk! In this film, the acting, the script, and the direction are all brilliant, and in harmony with one another.As for the trial itself, the defense argument was along these lines: they were judges (and therefore interpreters), not makers of law. They didn't know about the atrocities in the concentration camps. At least one of them saved or helped many by staying in their roles and doing the best they could under the heavy hand of the Third Reich. They were patriots, saw improvement in the country when Hitler took power, but did not know how far he would go. If you were going to convict these judges, you would have to convict many more Germans (and where would it stop?). The Americans themselves practiced Eugenics and killed thousands and thousands of innocents at Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The one small weakness I found was that the defense never makes the simple argument that these judges were forced to do what they did, just as countless others in Germany were, and would have been imprisoned or killed themselves had they not complied. Anyone who's lived under a totalitarian regime may understand, or at least empathize.I'm not saying I bought into these arguments or that one should be an apologist to Nazis, but the fact that the film presented such a strong defense was thought provoking. How fantastic is it that Spencer Tracy plays his character the way he does – simply pursuing the facts, and in a quiet, thoughtful way. It's the best of humanity. How heartbreaking is Burt Lancaster's character, admitting they knew, admitting their guilt, knowing that what happened was horrible and that they were wrong, and yet seeking Tracy's understanding in that scene in the jail cell at the end – intellectual to intellectual - and being rebuked. Even a single life taken unjustly was wrong. Had the Axis won the war, I don't know which Americans would have been on trial for war crimes for the fire bombings of Dresden and Tokyo, or for dropping the atomic bombs, but the film makes one think, even for a war when things were seemingly as black and white as they could ever be. The particulars of this trial were fictionalized, but it's representative of what really occurred, and it transports you into events 70 years ago which seem so unreal today – and yet are so vitally important to understand, and remember.",9,14,17,11 September 2017
Duck Soup," Great comedy, nice satire
","Lots of fun, great pace, and a nice satire of the lunacy of war. Groucho doles out wordplay and general zaniness, but it was Harpo that really cracked me up. If the brothers map to Freud's view of the parts of the human psyche, Harpo is definitely the id. His humor comes out of left field from a place of mayhem and anarchy (him taking scissors to pretty much anything he can get his hands on comes to mind), and the fact that he doesn't speak makes it all the more primal. Not all of the jokes in the script land, but many still do, and there is great range as well. At the suggestive end of the spectrum little is filtered because the film was pre-Code, and there's even a little jab at the unenforced guidelines when a horse is shown in bed with a couple. Through all of the craziness and despite Harpo saying years later that 'We were just four  trying to get a laugh,' there is a sophistication and a message to this humor.",8,0,0,3 November 2019
The Battle of Algiers," The grim reality of war - and colonialism
","A film that has a documentary feel to it, with extraordinary footage that was shot on location. The context - four years after Algerian independence had been won from the French and looking back on the war it took to get there, and at a time when the Vietnam war was being fought - puts it in stark contrast to the war movies from a couple of decades before. The film pulls few punches in showing violence and torture, so beware of its realism.What I found striking is that the leaders of the two sides seem upstanding, or at least living to some sort of rational code with moral values, and yet in the situation they're in, they choose to do some horrifying things. There is the leader of the French, who had been part of the (certainly noble) cause of the Resistance in WWII, explaining to reporters that if they want the French in Algiers, they have to accept the consequences. We then see the prisoners his men have captured being brutally tortured. There is the leader of the guerillas, explaining to his lieutenant in one scene how terrorism must segue to other forms of protest, and to reporters in another that if he had airplanes at his disposal, he wouldn't have to resort to it. And yet when we see baskets with bombs being left in public places with innocent civilians and children, it's hard to see the actions as necessary or honorable.The French military are in a difficult position, as when they strong-arm the population it naturally leads to more hatred of their presence, and when they're too lenient, letting Algerian women through security as a show of respect or because they've donned Western clothing, arms or bombs can slip through with devastating consequences. Meanwhile the insurgents adopt some nonviolent measure ala Gandhi, e.g. a worker's striker, but they believe that the French aren't just going to voluntarily give up their country without being forced (a reasonable view), and that violence in the form of terrorism is a big lever.It's hard to understand whether either side has to employ the tactics that they do, and it's in this fog of war, with violence leading to violence, that the film has devastating power. The underlying enemy is of course colonialism, which in this case lasted from 1830 to 1962, and whose inevitable outcome seems apparent - resentment, rebellion, bloodshed, and (eventual) independence, with variations on these themes all over the world. The film shows events as they happened in what I believe is a factual way, and it allows both sides to express their views, but its sympathies seem to be with the Algerians, or maybe it feels that way because we know in our hearts they should have a right to their country. And yet, it's tough to feel good about either side, or to be all that sanguine about mankind after watching it.",8,0,1,19 March 2019
Being John Malkovich," Fun and creative
","Lots to love about this one: the stunning puppet show, the absurdly low ceiling on floor 7Â½ , the surreal Malkovich being Malkovich scene, and the playing around with identity, gender, and sexuality. It's not deep or philosophical, but it's damn creative, unpredictable from beginning to end, and the script is peppered with wit. Great cast and some fun cameos too.Quote:
Schwartz: But the elderly have so much to offer, sir. They're our link with history.
Dr. Lester: I don't wanna be your goddamn link, damn ya. I want to feel Floris's naked thighs next to mine. I want my body to inspire lust in that beautiful, complex woman. I want her to shiver with a spasm of ecstasy, Schwartz, as I penetrate her wet...

The Machinist," Entertaining, though a little obvious
","Too predictable in where it was going, but I liked Christian Bale's commitment to the role, the Dostoevsky references, and that dark amusement park ride, Route 666. It was nice to see Jennifer Jason Leigh at 42 as well, since ageism applied to women is often so unfair, and the last scene she has with Bale radiates intensity from both of them. I like films that play with your mind and visually this film has a nice aesthetic; I just wish it was a little harder to figure out.",7,0,0,2 June 2020
Gandhi," Beautiful movie about a truly enlightened man
","As Einstein said about Gandhi, a quote included at the end of this movie, 'Generations to come will scarce believe that such a one as this ever, in flesh and blood, walked upon this earth.' Critics of this film will say that's in part because of the mythologizing of Gandhi, which director Richard Attenborough contributes to by not showing us questionable aspects of Gandhi's personal life, or some of the opinions he held. Just one example of the latter was his very naïve attitude towards Hitler, which I chalk up to the limits of his idealism more than anything else, not evil on his part – but that would have been 'fair ground' for a more accurate and balanced portrayal of the man. However, I have to say, those who focus on these omissions miss all that was absolutely accurate – and truly inspiring – in the film. This epic movie has beautiful shots of India and is beautiful in spirit. Who can possibly not be moved by this great man, whose simplicity and nonviolent approach to oppression and violence inspired Indians and the world? He endures beatings without raising a hand, and his moral rectitude and dignity never waver in dealing with the British, his countrymen, and his peers in the 'Home Rule' movement. He eschews pomp, embraces poverty, and demands authenticity. In testifying in his own defense while on trial, he says simply 'Non-cooperation with evil is a duty, and that British rule of India is evil.' In speaking with British officials, he says 'In the end you will walk out, because 100,000 Englishmen simply cannot control 350 million Indians, if those Indians refuse to cooperate – and that's what we intend to achieve – peaceful, nonviolent, non-cooperation, until you yourselves see the wisdom of leaving.' He tries desperately to hold Hindus and Muslims together in the aftermath, but is frail and then is of course assassinated.Perhaps the most difficult to watch or even fathom is the Jallianwala Bagh massacre in Amritsar, which Attenborough shows us right before the intermission. The brutality and cruelty of British Colonel Reginald Dyer is staggering, as was his callousness in the inquiries afterwards – and there is no exaggeration in the film. There are aspects that can be questioned about the film – why a white man was hired to play the part of Gandhi (even though Kingsley is fantastic), why Jinnah was portrayed in too negative a light (possibly due to the influence of the Indian government, who helped sponsor the film), and why Gandhi was overly idealized. It's not perfect, and neither was he. However, the truth is that the man was courageous, enlightened, and an awe-inspiring moral beacon to us all. His words were beautiful – and the film gets all of this right. For companion reading, try 'Mohandas Gandhi Essential Writings', which has a number of fantastic passages, and provides a more complete view of the man. In the meantime, I highly recommend this movie. Just one more quote, in his speech in front of a packed house, which threatens to become violent in the face of unfair new British Laws:'In this cause, I too am prepared to die; but my friends, there is no cause for which I am prepared to kill. Whatever they do to us, we will attack no one, kill no one, but we will not give our fingerprints, not one of us. They will imprison us, they will fine us, they will seize our possessions, but they cannot take away our self-respect if we will not give it to them.  I am asking you to fight. To fight against their anger, not to provoke it. We will not strike a blow, but we will receive them, and through our pain, we will make them see their injustice, and it will hurt, as all fighting hurts. But we cannot lose. We cannot. They may torture my body, break my bones, even kill me – then, they will have my dead body – not my obedience.'Hallelujah.",9,1,1,1 December 2016
Jackie," Awful
","Ugh. What a disappointing movie this was. The storytelling is awful. The script, which has Jackie and Bobby saying ridiculous and vain things shortly after the assassination, alternates between inauthenticity and cliché. The movie's scope is so narrow – it's titled 'Jackie' but we learn very little about her, since it focuses on her redecoration of the White House and the assassination and its aftermath. That's it! And even then, director Pablo Larrain somehow manages to botch it. He gets Jackie's spirit wrong, and manages to take one of the most dramatic events in American history and make it feel melodramatic. He doesn't give us anything about the larger context of her life, Kennedy's Presidency, or America at the time, and even in trying to tell us what he does, inexplicably leaves out the indelible image of JKF Jr. saluting his father at the funeral.As for the film's vaunted acting, I found Natalie Portman uninspired as Jackie, and Peter Sarsgaard insipid as Bobby. Neither comes close to pulling off what are admittedly difficult roles. The dialog between Jackie and the priest (John Hurt) is banal and cringe-inducing. The interview with reporter (Billy Crudup) is as well. I am loathe to write extreme reviews particularly when on this site you see maximum ratings for simply good or mediocre movies, or the reverse, decent films getting trashed. I am also into historical films such as this and frankly, normally adore Natalie Portman. And yet here I am, utterly annoyed and giving 'Jackie' an extremely low rating. This could (and should) have been a far, far better movie. How insulting to the Kennedys, and to history.",1,1,4,11 September 2017
Inside Out," Creating and touching
","Maybe the best animated movies I've ever seen, 'Inside Out' is very creative and touching at the same time. It makes you think about everything that could be going on inside the mind of a child when she's going through difficult adjustments in her life, and more generally, what goes on inside all of us. I'm not sure why the film has drawn such ire from some viewers, maybe it's just one of those love/hate movies, or maybe you (or a loved one) have to have gone through a serious struggle to have it resonate. I loved the poignant scenes of leaving childhood memories behind (wow! these were just stunning to me), and how the somewhat unlikely hero turned out to be little Sadness.",9,5,24,30 March 2016
Gone with the Wind," Compelling story, iconic moments, and fantastic production value - but in a toxic context
","A movie that's certainly worth watching, but it's hard not to be conflicted, and it's a tough one to rate.Positives:
<ul><li>Clark Gable and Vivien Leigh are outstanding in their roles of these two selfish people, who, while difficult to like, spiral around each other and deliver iconic Hollywood moments. He recognizes they're cut from the same cloth and loves her for it, she sees the same thing and hates him. A sexual current runs through their relationship from the first time he undresses her with his eyes, and she remarks 'He looks as if he knows what I look like without my shimmy.' Later he'll tell her 'You should be kissed, and often, and by someone who knows how,' and it's clear without saying it when he helps her what he wants in return (after all, he's 'not a marrying man'). Gable's character is perceptive throughout the movie, and he's an interesting mix of rogue, gallant, bemused observer, and doting father.</li></ul><ul><li>The filmmaking is extraordinary, particularly for 1939. There are exquisite scenes in glorious color, and the soundtrack is fantastic. War-time shots in the first half, like the horse and carriage escaping a massive fire, the one of all the wounded laid out, and the operation are memorable.</li></ul><ul><li>Hattie McDaniel is a delight to watch in the role of Mammy, the tough-minded servant who tries to keep a proper sense of decorum and the willful Scarlett in line. While some criticized her for taking a stereotypical role (similar to the criticism Anna May Wong suffered), this was the part available, and it was a step forward for her to take it, own it, and win an Oscar. Special favors had to be called in just to allow her to get her in to the Cocoanut Grove nightclub for the Oscars, and even then she had to sit in the back at a small table. I recently visited her simple grave in Angelus-Rosedale Cemetery, where she was buried instead of Hollywood Cemetery because she wasn't allowed in to the latter. She was discriminated against even in death, and it's important to remember that racism and segregation weren't just occurring in the past, or only in the Jim Crow South.</li></ul><ul><li>There is a feminist message in the strength of the two main female characters. Scarlett is manipulative and shallow, but she's also tough and a survivor. She makes it through bleak times, shoots a ravaging Union soldier in the face, and at one point while trying to run a business 'Great balls of fire! Don't bother me anymore, and don't call me sugar!' Similarly, while Melanie (Olivia de Havilland) can be almost maddeningly pure, seeing the good in everyone despite their obvious evil, she acts as an almost Christ-like role model.</li></ul>Negatives:
<ul><li>There is no point sugar-coating this: the movie, and the book it's based on, is racist. It perpetuates the horrifying myth of the loyal, docile, and simple slave. These smiling African-Americans have no interest in freedom, and in the few scenes they're in, they look simply like employees of Plantation, Inc. The character of Prissy is feeble-minded and helpless. The film tried to avoid controversy and be as neutral as possible, but what we see for the most part are essentially cartoons.</li></ul><ul><li>From its opening credits, the movie perpetuates a myth about an entire way of life, that the South was noble and filled with honorable people, and now sadly all of that is gone. Historically this is inaccurate, and morally it's outrageous. And yet, 70+ years after the war, this was the narrative, with a message diametrically opposed to that of 'Uncle Tom's Cabin'. The slaveholders are shown to be kind and thoughtful aristocrats, and it's instead the Yankee carpetbaggers who are portrayed as cruel and vicious. Deviations from the book are apparently rather modest, but one major one is Ashley Wilkes (Leslie Howard) and another character no longer being members of the KKK; instead they go off to a 'political meeting'. Before the war, Ashley says that 'Most of the miseries of the world were caused by wars, and when the wars were over, no one ever knew what they were about,' as if this particular war fit that case - being fought over for some vague reason. After the war, he says without a hint of irony 'I will not make money out of the enforced labor and misery of others.' Even Scarlett points out the hypocrisy, but it's as if this male voice, this Major in the Confederate Army can't bring himself to mention slavery or race issues. This is consistent with the shameful Southern apologia that has never truly been dissipated, recent statue removal notwithstanding.</li></ul><ul><li>In addition to my problems with his role, Leslie Howard does not fit here. He does not seem like a Southern gentleman from the period at all, and does not bring nearly the authenticity that Gable brings in his scenes of passion. In an otherwise fine cast, he is quite weak.</li></ul><ul><li>The second half of the movie is far too melodramatic, and practically a soap opera. To some this is faithful to the book, entertaining, and helpful to create an epic feel to it all, but to me it's overdone, and artistically sloppy. It also leads to a bloated four hour run time, and I think it would have been more powerful condensed. </li></ul>Summary:
The film is insidious because the story, its characters, and its production value are all so compelling, and yet the background context is so toxic. Can we mentally set aside those gigantic elephants in the room, and forgive it? Is this like a romantic Southern version of 'War and Peace', where we note that in his epic, Tolstoy didn't write of the ownership and oppression to serfs? Can we see it as the viewpoint of a defeated secessionist country, and understand what de Havilland would say in an interview years later - that 'All countries have experienced war and defeat. And survival. They can identify with that film for, I think, that reason.' It's tough. Very tough. I can neither love not despise this film.",7,5,10,2 October 2018
District 9," Solid science fiction with a message
","It's not hard to spot the commentary on the cruelty of mankind, and in how these aliens are treated, to recognize how we treat each other, be it during apartheid in South Africa, or more recently, refugee camps along the southern U.S. border. There is no sign of an attempt to understand the alien culture or what intelligence they have by scholars, it's all about making sure they're subordinated, their weapon technology harvested, and anything of value monetized. The speed with which this occurs is devastating, but the film is lightened up a little bit by the humor of the naïve agent (Sharlto Copley) who bumbles through rounding the aliens up for relocation. When he's accidentally sprayed with some form of alien fuel, he begins morphing into one of them, and in the absurdity of it all, I thought of Gregor Samsa waking up to find he was a bug. It's all madness, and yet, the militaristic, inhuman response of the earthlings has disturbing elements of truth. It's unfortunate that the back half of the film becomes increasingly filled with action film clichés and concentrates mostly on special effects, plot holes be damned, losing its way from what was such a strong start. It's entertaining for sure, but could have been a classic had it not targeted being a blockbuster.",7,1,1,25 February 2020
The Favourite," Well done
","The film takes liberties with history and spices things up considerably with ribald language, sex, and some poison tossed in as well, but the germ of the story is accurate, and the dramatization is very entertaining. The manipulation and struggle for power behind the scenes in the case of a weak absolute ruler certainly rings true from countless examples, and in the many whims of Queen Anne is a cautionary tale, on top of all the humor and intrigue. There were times when I thought all the fish-eye and wide angle lens shots from director Yorgos Lanthimos were overdone, but in some way they seem to go with this warped world with its opulence everywhere, and the film is gorgeous. Great performances from Emma Stone, Olivia Colman, and Rachel Weisz too. That look on Emma Stone's face at the end is perfect.",8,3,5,13 September 2019
Lawrence of Arabia," Magnificent
","Absolutely magnificent. There are so many awe-inspiring shots in this film, from the grand sweeping desert vistas, to the horseman emerging out of a mirage in that glorious long shot, to the three figures in the distance with a huge sun rising on the horizon, to Lawrence on his camel at the Red Sea after the Battle of Aqaba ... it just seems like I could go on and on. Also beautiful are the little shots that are so poetic, such as that moment when we see Lawrence's shadow as he leaps nimbly atop a Turkish train he's just derailed. The scope and grandeur of what director David Lean and cinematographer Freddie Young accomplished here can't be overstated.There are historical inaccuracies but it seems to me that the gist is reasonably correct, and I liked how the flaws of British politics, British racism, and Lawrence's personal issues which led up to the Tafas massacre were all exposed ... even as we are blown away by some aspects of his character (and certainly by his bravery, and his desire for Arab independence and self-rule). The fact that to take Aqaba from its unguarded side he really did go through 600 miles of desert by camel over a two month period with only 45 rebels, each carrying only water and a 45 pound sack of flour at the outset, is mind-boggling to say the least.Peter O'Toole leads an extraordinary cast, and perfectly looks the part (who cares about the height difference to the real Lawrence?). Robert Graves wrote that T.E. Lawrence's eyes 'immediately held me ... they were startlingly blue, even by artificial light' - and that's certainly true of O'Toole. More importantly, he delivers an inspired, nuanced, and ambiguous performance, one that's as elusive and tortured as the desert sand being whipped up into spirals by the wind. Alec Guinness is similarly striking as Faisal, future king of Greater Syria and then Iraq. As he stares into the prospect of the British and French divided up the Middle East for its oil per the Sykes-Picot Agreement, he says so wisely:'There's nothing further here for a warrior. We drive bargains. Old men's work. Young men make wars, and the virtues of war are the virtues of young men. Courage and hope for the future. Then old men make the peace. And the vices of peace are the vices of old men. Mistrust and caution. It must be so.'Great film, and truly worthy of being dubbed epic.",9,2,2,10 December 2019
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Entertaining throughout
","Highlights:
<ul><li>Tarantino's impeccable attention to detail for the period is everywhere.</li><li>Beautifully shot as always, with a highlight being the tracking shots alongside car and horse rides.</li><li>Character development took a precedence over excess action and violence as the story built up.</li><li>Leonardo DiCaprio and Brad Pitt are fantastic.</li><li>10-year-old Julia Butters as the precocious child actor is pretty great too.</li><li>Margaret Qualley leads a good cast for the Manson family; the scene on the ranch is suitably creepy.</li><li>Evokes the glamor of Hollywood but also the pathos of those on the edge, e.g. aging and B-actors.</li><li>Entertaining throughout a long run time, 161 minutes.</li></ul>Lowlights:
<ul><li>Oddly constructed story, with the Manson murder aspect somewhat appended on.</li><li>Along these lines, not nearly enough Margot Robbie / Sharon Tate.</li><li>What was up with the diss of Bruce Lee? Not a fan of that scene.</li><li>Revenge fantasy via alternate versions of history seems a little overdone by QT at this point.</li><li>Gruesome violence in the end scene. It felt a little like Tarantino feeding red meat to his base, and it was kinda tough to hear these scenes cheered when we're living in such a climate of violence. It's as if Tarantino is showing us what he would like to do to those who would link on-screen violence to real-life violence, which has been a touchy issue for him over his career. One of the brainwashed Manson women (Mikey Madison) says 'My idea is to kill the people who taught us to kill!' and then, well, we see what happens to her.</li></ul>",8,12,18,6 August 2019
Get Out," Fresh and intelligent thriller
","The less you know about this movie before you watch it, the better. It's a creepy, delicious thriller, and one where even when you think you know what might be going on, there's more to it than you realize. There are elements that feel derivative, but on the other hand, Director Jordan Peele tells this story well, and it feels fresh and intelligent. Daniel Kaluuya and Allison Williams turn in very nice performances, and the supporting cast is solid as well. I loved Lil Rel Howery, who plays the friend, a TSA agent who tries to help from afar. There are many great moments – the round of 'Bingo' led by the father, Kaluuya seeing the pictures of Williams and her expression on that last one, and the effects going to the 'sunken place'. It also puts a mirror up to how white people in real life, even well-meaning ones, sometimes talk to African-Americans in their attempts to relate to them or 'be cool' – stilted, with references that often bring up race, and at least sometimes subtly racist. How great it was to see a diverse cast, and to see this perspective, without it being delivered in a heavy-handed manner. It's not original enough to be in a list of greatest ever thrillers, but it's solid and enjoyable from beginning to end.",8,14,28,29 November 2017
A Quiet Place," A reasonably good thriller
","A bit of a cross between 'The Road', with its dystopian apocalyptic world made all the more scary by the presence of one's children, along with 'Predator', with alien creatures and their different sensory abilities preying on humans. I don't think there is anything terribly new here, but the story is well told by director John Krasinski who also stars, and the performances are all pretty good. You do have to suspend disbelief a bit on a few things, but it wasn't so much that it detracted me from enjoying the film. I do wish that there was more restraint in the ending, and that the shotgun hadn't been a part of the solution. The way it is, it's like if the bacteria in 'The War of the Worlds' had just made the aliens vulnerable, so that they could then be blown away by firearms.",7,2,5,12 May 2018
Dog Day Afternoon," Great portrait of New York in the 70's, and Pacino is captivating
","I love the wonderful sense of New York in the 1970's that this film gives us. The characters, dialog, and shots on location in Brooklyn are all highly authentic. It's Al Pacino who really makes the film though, with a performance that is captivating and endearing. He's bumbling and ill-prepared as the leader of this bank heist, yet he's cagey and street-wise as a New York rat. We first get a glimpse of how amateurish these criminals are when one of the three bails early on in the robbery, which is a comical moment. We also smile at Pacino's handling of the situation. He realizes the importance of the hostages he suddenly finds himself holding, but far from being heavy-handed, he tries to be decent with them. He whips the crowd up into an anti-establishment frenzy by shouting 'Attica!', throwing wads of money into the air, and paying for pizza delivery. He gets into a shouting match with a police sergeant (Charles Durning). He talks to his wife, mother, and transgender lover (Chris Sarandon), and each conversation is touched with pathos, and fantastic. To his mother he says 'I'm a fuck-up and I'm an outcast. If you get near me you're gonna get it. You're gonna get fucked over and fucked out.' It's the outcast underdog that we find ourselves rooting for.I love the simple acceptance of his sexuality, which is incidental and doesn't devolve into some type of stereotype - well ahead of its time. Director Sidney Lumet shows the seamy side of New York, but at the same time, its humanity. The characters are blunt, but understanding of one another when they simply say what they want. The relationships in this tense stand-off are fascinating. I also liked how Lumet gets us into the story immediately. We learn the backstories and characters of the criminals, including Pacino's henchman (John Cazale) gradually, and in little moments, such as finding out he fears their escape plan because he's never been on an airplane before. The film works as both a hostage drama and as a character study. It may be a teeny bit too long at 125 minutes, but has held up well over the years, and is definitely worth watching.",8,1,3,13 February 2018
Slap Shot," Love those Hanson brothers
","I love how they got Paul Newman for this part, and how great he looks out on the ice. The film parodies the violence in hockey, and it had some potentially interesting bits in the class aspects of a blue collar town facing a plant closing, as well as a mostly faceless owner who disdains the sport and simply looks forward to a tax write-off, but unfortunately these don't come to much. Worse is the cringe-inducing homophobia. The best part of the film are the hilarious Hanson brothers, and the film could have used a lot more of them.",7,1,1,29 September 2019
Mulholland Drive," Mind-blowing
","Marvelously clever and stylish. The first two hours require patience, as it's unclear what's going on and how all of the disparate threads tie together, but when they do in that last half hour, it's mind-blowing. I love how Lynch created a puzzle that's so sophisticated that even once you grasp the basic concept, your analysis with those around you will probably continue on for awhile, e.g. for what various things mean, and how all of the elements of reality are incorporated into the dream. The ambiguity is fantastic. It's an understatement to say that Lynch elevated a pretty simple story with the surreal, out of order way he told it, and the narrative device went very well with the dashed dream of stardom in tinseltown and the satirical elements of the industry he incorporates. Naomi Watts and Laura Elena Harring are amazing in it too.",10,6,10,1 January 2020
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," The kitchen sink of Star Wars movies
","It's far better than the retread 'The Force Awakens', but there's still something awkward about this latest trilogy in the Star Wars franchise. It's a bit of a 'kitchen sink', where writer and director Rian Johnson throws everything he can at us, whether it makes sense or not, and should have tightened it up. The plot requires contrived delays in time, such as when Finn (John Boyega) and Rose (Kelly Marie Tran) go off to look for the codebreaker. There are aspects which feel derivative, such as the aging master, Luke Skywalker, disillusioned and bitter - which also has Star Wars fanatics feeling disillusioned and bitter. And there are moments which feel just wrong, such as Yoda and Luke enjoying a nice bonfire of sacred Jedi texts (ugh). And yet, the movie is entertaining, and has some great scenes. The ambiguous chemistry between Ren (Daisy Ridley) and Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) is compelling, as is the moment they face Supreme Leader Snoke (Andy Serkis). The scene where Kylo Ren and Skywalker battle is fantastic. I love how the film wrong-foots on a couple of occasions, and for the diversity in its cast. It may be cruel with Carrie Fisher having passed away, but I was not a fan of her performance, though Mark Hammill is great. Ridley and Driver were great choices, and set the franchise up well for the future. There's a lot of polarizing passion out there but don't believe the extremes. It's enjoyable for what it is.",7,1,3,27 December 2017
The Evil Dead," Camp appeal only
","Nice effects, but no story, ridiculous characters, and godawful acting. This is more of a comedy than a horror movie because of how stupid everything is. There's camp appeal in what seems like a school project but no tension, and aside from occasionally laughing at it, it was boring. The rape by a demonized tree is pretty bad too.",4,1,1,4 April 2020
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Gogo!
","The presence of the daughter of Vernita Green (Vivica A. Fox) and the backstory of O-Ren Ishii (Lucy Liu) shows that revenge begets revenge begets revenge, and I loved that. I also loved Chiaki Kuriyama in the role of the sadistic teenage schoolgirl Gogo Yubari; she practically steals the movie, no offense to Uma Thurman. Otherwise the recipe for this Tarantino cocktail includes a blend of many things, all of which undoubtedly tickle the director personally - samurai, anime, and martial arts films, along with a generous amount of campy American cultural references, lots of creative dismemberment and blood spray, and some foot shots besides. I think it was a mistake to cut the film into two parts, but the first volume entertains on its own.",8,0,1,26 September 2019
Prisoners," Interesting, but could have been better
","An intricate plot keeps this drama interesting for a film that almost seems to be preying on every parent's worst fear, that their children will be abducted. It's tense, has several brutally tough moments, and it's tough to guess exactly where it's going. I liked the intensity of the performances as well as the filming location, which takes us to this small town, though I was surprised it was done in Georgia instead of Pennsylvania, where the story is set.My reservations were around the film feeling a little too Hollywood, if that makes any sense. The details in the setup invariably factoring in, the vigilante dad, the black neighbors present but subordinate, and the cop who repeatedly breaks the law in how he pursues the case leading up to the big, canned moments towards the end - it all feels a little produced. It was also hard for me to like the out of control behavior from the dad and cop (Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhaal) given all the things they do. That's of course one of the points, that anger and frustration can turn people into demons, but the film wants it both ways, with the cop being a hero and the father really being a good guy at heart, praying to God often, and just doing everything he can for his kids. It should have picked one side or the other, and probably should have been pared down as well. It's entertaining if you're looking for a wild ride and a good popcorn drama, but just kind of standard stuff, and could have been better.",7,0,0,31 March 2020
Into the Wild," Touching
","Stunning scenery, brilliant directing from Sean Penn, soulful songs from Eddie Vedder, and a remarkable, true story. Christopher McCandless (Emile Hirsch) is a college graduate from an affluent upbringing who decides to abandon his possessions and money and to live life out on the road, ala Jack London or Jack Kerouac during parts of their lives. He's a fascinating character because of his idealism and his nonconformity; he's intelligent and kind, and yet he doesn't value human relationships, preferring solitude and a deep connection to nature. Hirsch plays the part very well, displaying an easy, personable warmth but at the same time a determination to go his own way, damn the consequences. He also really looks the part, including scenes where he had to lose quite a bit of weight. His character is troubled from an upbringing that was riddled with strife, and in one moments says so simply (and sadly) 'Some people feel like they don't deserve love. They walk away quietly into empty spaces, trying to close the gaps of the past,' and yet we get the feeling that is just one aspect of a complicated and yet simple guy.I think some people are turned off by what they feel was a glorification, but I didn't feel that way at all. We see the trail of tears he leaves behind him, with his parents and sister devastated by not hearing from him, and him ignoring some of the kindly advice he receives along the way. He is also brutal to an old man (Hal Holbrook) who so very generously offers to adopt him, in what is a fantastic scene. Holbrook is also brilliant when he tells the young man 'when you forgive, you love.' We see him take risks which pay off (kayaking down a rampaging river), and of course others which do not (going into the true wild of Alaska without a map or enough preparation). For that he is sometimes vilified or mocked, but I admired him for not conforming like the rest of us, and for living life on his own terms. He certainly was not cheated. And in the end, he has his moment of realization, that 'happiness (is) only real when shared', which is a moment that is incredibly poignant.I loved the literary references in the film, starting with the title card quoting Byron, which seems so perfect: 'There is a pleasure in the pathless woods; / There is a rapture on the lonely shore; / There is society, where none intrudes, / By the deep sea, and music in its roar; / I love not man the less, but Nature more...'And at the end as I thought about McCandless's life, I thought that this passage from Thoreau was nowhere more suitable: 'Why should we be in such desperate haste to succeed, and in such desperate enterprises? If a man does not keep pace with his companions, perhaps it is because he hears a different drummer. Let him step to the music which he hears, however measured or far away.'",9,9,11,10 July 2019
Annie Hall," Brilliant
","Probably the best romantic comedy you'll ever see. Woody Allen plays Alvy Singer, an insecure, cerebral comedian living in Manhattan (hmm), who is trying to understand how his relationship with Annie Hall (Diane Keaton) ended. The script is fantastic, and Allen gives us a steady stream of jokes ranging from subtle, intellectual references to physical comedy, and while I only laughed out loud a few times, I was often smiling. He also uses a variety of creative techniques in this film - speaking directly to the camera, stepping directly into childhood memories, giving voice to inner thoughts, and including a brief animation, among other things. He explores love, sex, and relationships, but also the cultural differences between Jews and Gentiles, and New Yorkers and Californians in clever ways. His understated facial reaction as Keaton orders Pastrami on white bread with lettuce and tomatoes is priceless.The film is sweet, endearing, and sentimental about relationships, and yet it's also balanced, showing the bittersweet pitfalls with just the right touches, including a brilliant ending. On top of all that, it's great to see Paul Simon in a couple of scenes, Allen's references to the 1969 documentary 'The Sorrow and the Pity', and Diane Keaton's wonderful performance of 'Seems Like Old Times'. Great film, and very worthy of the Academy Awards it won.",10,0,1,20 May 2016
2001: A Space Odyssey," Masterpiece
","Absolutely brilliant.I'm probably not going to say anything that hasn't already been said a million times before, but I loved:<ul><li>HAL. What extraordinary moments and interactions these are - that voice, those tight shot on HAL's cold all-seeing 'eye', the slow realization that HAL is up to something. In an age that wonders about what robots and AI will lead to, this was well ahead of its time.</li></ul><ul><li>The special effects. With big moments and lots of little touches Kubrick transports us to space, whether it's spinning, floating, or drifting, and it all holds up very well 50 years later.</li></ul><ul><li>The symmetry of 'The Dawn of Man' bookended with 'Jupiter and Beyond the Infinite.' Early man reaching up to a mysterious monolith and take the first crude step in evolving; modern man reaching a distant monolith and seeing things far beyond his understanding, and maybe taking another step at evolving? There are other parallels; we go from early man using an animal femur as a club to kill early on, to Dave quietly killing HAL by unplugging him/it. We go from tight shots on HAL's eye to Dave's as he tries to fathom the psychedelic mind-blowing experience.</li></ul><ul><li>The score. So well chosen, starting with the epic sound of Strauss's 'Also sprach Zarathustra'.</li></ul><ul><li>The scope. Man reaches for the stars, into the unknown, so vulnerable in the vastness of the universe, and also vulnerable to his own technology. The scale is cosmic, and we see that the jump from early man to man in space really was as sudden as the jump in the film. It explores man's place and fate in the universe, but is wisely ambiguous and open to interpretation.</li></ul><ul><li>The aesthetic. It all goes so well together. The visual appeal, the use of grand music and silence, it's all very poetic, and there is great attention to detail. The all-black monolith, such a perfect symbol that there is greater knowledge out there, but hard to comprehend. There is such a unifying, artistic vision Kubrick brought to this film.</li></ul>I saw it when younger a few times, and was put off a little bit by its slow pace. I think it's perfect now.",10,0,2,21 February 2019
Midsommar," Beautiful film, and Pugh is a revelation
","Florence Pugh is tremendous from the very start, with that extraordinary first scene where she conveys so many emotions in her face while on the phone. It's a terrific performance and I can't wait to see more from her.I love how well Ari Aster writes/directs scenes with deep grief and emotions in both this film and Hereditary. The actors have to deliver of course and they do, but there is such honesty in the material and the amount of time he spends on it that it adds considerable depth to the horror that follows.This is also quite simply a gorgeous film. The colors, camera angles, ceremonies, nature scenery, those slightly off-kilter roofs on the buildings ... it's all so visually stunning. The soundtrack definitely keeps up with it too.It may go on a teeny bit too long especially since we see the gist of what's coming, but on the other hand, it allows for this culture to be rendered so completely in every disturbing little way, and I was engaged to the end.Quote:
'I'm trying to keep an open mind though. That's cultural, you know? We stick our elders in nursing homes; I'm sure they find that disturbing. I think we really need to just at least try to acclimate.'",8,10,16,29 January 2020
Singin' in the Rain," An absolute masterpiece
","An absolute masterpiece, and easily, easily the highest rating. Gene Kelly's performance of 'Singin' in the Rain' has to be the greatest dance numbers ever performed on film, and I could watch it over and over again. He's a genius throughout this movie as both actor and director. It's just one fantastic number after another, including Donald O'Connor's 'Make 'Em Laugh', the two gentlemen and a 19-year- old Debbie Reynolds performing 'Good Morning' which includes that beautiful sofa sequence at the end, and Kelly dancing with Cyd Charisse in a stunning 'imagined sequence within an imagined sequence', with beautiful modern art touches – and many others. This film works on all levels – a musical, of course, but also a romantic-comedy, and an ode to Hollywood's past. It makes you feel good not just because of the story, but because of the irrepressible joy in the performances, and because of you know you're seeing real artistry in the choreography and execution. They make it look smooth and easy, often making the most (so creatively!) out of an economy of space, but if you read the stories of the effort that went in, you'll appreciate it all the more. It's not for nothing that the cast of LaLaLand watched this movie every day on set for inspiration. Pure joy.",10,1,2,1 February 2017
Total Recall," Great premise, very entertaining
","A rollicking good science-fiction story, one with a great premise from Philip K. Dick, and well executed by director Paul Verhoeven. The elements of mind manipulation and layers of identity are fantastic, giving the film some nice twists to it to go with all the special effects. Arnold Schwarzenegger is fun to watch, and so are Rachel Ticotin and Sharon Stone (his love interests), as well as Ronny Cox and Michael Ironside (the bad guys). I like how the futuristic elements show creativity in dreaming up new technology, but also blend it with elements of human behavior that will never change, e.g. greed, lust, the crassness of the advertising, etc which will remind you of Verhoeven's Robocop. I could have done without some of the one-liners, e.g. when Arnie goes at someone with a giant drill and yells 'Screw you!' at the precise moment that films like this seem to work desperately hard to get a cheesy catch phrase in, which is so shlocky. The elements of mass slave labor exploitation, disinformation, and mind control give the film a gravitas underneath all of that though. It's a great popcorn movie, and clearly influential.",9,3,4,19 August 2019
Pulp Fiction," Masterpiece
","What an absolute blast and wild ride this film is. Everything about it screams joy and having fun at the movie theater. The cast is extraordinary, my god. Jackson, Travolta, Thurman, Rhames, Willis, Keitel, Stoltz, Arquette, Walken, Roth, Plummer, de Medeiros ... that's 12 fantastic actors playing 12 fantastic characters. If you think about it, each of them is given a moment to absolutely shine, and they literally all come through. The script is brilliant, with dialogue that crackles between philosophy, wry observations, and street talk that is as hilarious as it is earthy. There are so many great scenes, and you can just feel Tarantino reveling in the film's campiness, its soundtrack, and its (many) surprise moments. I also love how he told the story out of order, in a very creative way. Brilliant.",10,0,0,30 March 2019
Three Colors: Blue," Excellent for its craft
","A realistic, touching portrait of grieving, with Juliette Binoche shining in the lead role of a woman who's lost both her husband and young daughter in a car accident. Her wound is so deep that she initially rejects everything around her, but in her numbness and isolation the past creeps in, often in the form of an unfinished musical composition. This haunting by music and evolving over time to pick it up again and finish it fits in well with the process she's going through. The pace of the film is a little on the deliberate side, and unfortunately I didn't feel a cathartic connection while watching it, which made me like it more for the craft than emotionally. On the other hand, I did feel as though I should be more gentle and kind to people I run across in real life who may be acting out in their own unseen private worlds of grief. I also loved how director Krzysztof Kieslowski gave us some very nice effects with lights and reflections, including that marvelous shot of the little girl looking through the back window of the car early on. The various effects in blue over the course of the film do eventually start feeling a little forced though. Not bad, but not one I'd be rushing to watch again.",7,1,1,13 December 2019
The Disaster Artist," Stupidity immortalized
","I'm not really into the whole 'it's so bad it's good' thing, and am not one of the fans of the cult movie 'The Room' (2003), so I'm afraid this review is going to be counter to prevailing opinions. James Franco turns in a strong performance to be sure, and really does recreate the making of that awful film (as he's eager to show us in clips put side by side at the end), but I guess I have to wonder...why? I don't think the stupidity of Tommy Wiseau needed to be further immortalized. There are some very human moments - Franco saying 'you're the monster' to an audience who don't support his attempts at drama, and later him cringing at his premiere amidst the hooting and hollering of the crowd - but they are offset by everything else, which is just laughing at how idiotic this guy was. Regardless, I don't find the film (either the original or this 'documentary') all that funny, although Seth Rogen did rip off a few good lines. I admire Franco for the uniqueness of this film and for the tightness of his storytelling, but think he could apply his talents to far better things.",6,7,13,2 January 2018
Zombieland," Very entertaining
","There is some (probably requisite) violence in this zombie thriller, but it's also got humor, some nice touches in editing, and it's very entertaining. The cast is fantastic, with Woody Harrelson, Emma Stone, Jesse Eisenberg, and Abigail Breslin all turning in performances perfectly tuned to the genre. The scenes with Bill Murray are all very funny, and one part in particular is absolutely hilarious, but I won't spoil it. Eisenberg channels Woody Allen at times with his shy awkwardness. Trying to do both comedy and horror is difficult, but director Ruben Fleischer really pulls it off. This is a fun movie to watch.",8,11,16,1 April 2017
It's a Wonderful Life," It's a Wonderful Film
","Capra's masterpiece. It's easily the film I've seen the most times in my life, and still incredibly moving after all these years. The film is very well cast, with Lionel Barrymore and Jimmy Stewart especially turning in excellent performances, and Capra tells the story perfectly, delivering one five star scene after another. The development of the romance with Donna Reed's character is sweet and wonderful, as are the fantasy elements. It's a film that swells my heart with that rousing ending, and also along the way with so many powerful messages:<ul><li>What comes around goes around. It's telling that the first guy in line to give money to George at the end is the same one who demanded his full $242 when there was a run on the Building and Loan, and that even the taciturn bank examiner chips in. George treats people with decency and respect even when they're surly or flawed, and it all comes back to him.</li></ul><ul><li>Count your blessings. I think at some point in every life one looks back on dreams that weren't quite realized or compromises that were made along the way; George never getting out of Bedford Falls to see the world, go to college, or build thing is a symbol for that. The film shows real darkness when his frustrations about life boil over into raging like a lunatic in front of his family, and then considers suicide.</li></ul><ul><li>You matter. A cynic might say that the world would probably go on mostly the same if any one of us was here or not, and it's an exaggeration that early on young George (played well by Bobby Anderson) has already saved two lives, his brother's and whoever was going to take the medicine old man Gower accidentally laced with poison. But we do make a much bigger difference in the lives of those around us than we probably realize, and I think the story amplifies George's impact in Bedford Falls to make this point.</li></ul><ul><li>Stand up to the evil side of capitalism. The only hope of thwarting the Potters of the world is to stand up for what's right and to stick together. George bravely and selflessly sticks up for the immigrant 'garlic-eaters' and blue collar folks like Bert the cop and Ernie the taxi driver; by contrast Potter lives only to amass more wealth and power. What a nice little touch that little skull on his desk was. Stewart and Barrymore's scenes together are brilliant, and lines like this ring true just as much today as they did then (just replace Potter with Bezos, et al):</li></ul>'Do you know how long it takes a working man to save five thousand dollars? Just remember this, Mr. Potter, that this rabble you're talking about, they do most of the working and paying and living and dying in this community. Well, it is too much to have them work and pay and live and die in a couple of decent rooms and a bath? Anyway, my father didn't think so. People were human beings to him but to you, a warped, frustrated old man, they're cattle. Well, in my book, he died a much richer man than you'll ever be.'<ul><li>Most (but not all) people are good. There are obviously elements of religious faith in the film, with the angel (Henry Travers) and prayer playing big roles, but I think the more important faith Capra is showing us is that in our fellow man. Almost everyone is redeemed, which is sometimes shown in little ways, e.g. the teacher who maybe should have made sure Zuzu came home with her coat buttoned, being the same one quoted by Zuzu when she says 'Look, Daddy. Teacher says every time a bell rings, an angel gets his wings.' Everyone is redeemed, that is, except Potter, unlike the situation in Capra's 'You Can't Take It With You' from eight years earlier. Even in this idealistic film, the older and wiser Capra knew that there is always going to be some element of evil in the world which must be confronted.</li></ul>After the war Capra was especially determined to make his movies life affirming, saying 'My films must let every man, woman, and child know that God loves them, that I love them, and that peace and salvation will become a reality only when they all learn to love each other.' He achieves this with such artistry in 'It's a Wonderful Life' that it will always be one of my favorites.",10,0,0,27 December 2019
Psycho," Masterpiece
","A masterpiece, and for my money, one of the greatest films of all time. From the moment Hitchcock tells us it's 2:43 pm and Janet Leigh's character skipped even eating her sandwich to spend three hours in carnal bliss with John Gavin's, to that penultimate shot on Anthony Perkins with a twisted smile on his face, it's quite simply one five star scene after another.The tension never lets up, there is that extraordinary shift from one main character to another mid-film, and there is more than one misdirection that keeps the first-time viewer guessing. The voyeur scene, the abrupt killing of a main character, and the entire concept of the mental condition were all very original in 1960.The cast is fantastic, from Perkins (who should have gotten an Oscar) and Janet Leigh (easily my favorite Hitchcock lead actress) all the way down to that cop who stops for Leigh and then later stares at her so perfectly from across the street while she's with the used car dealer.There are so many other little moments of tension: Leigh's employer seeing her in her car when he thought she was going home, the car that doesn't sink into the swamp all that easily, and the searches into the ominous old house. There are also those big moments too, a couple of which need to be included in any discussion of the greatest scenes in film history. The other aspects of the film keep up too - the score is brilliant, and Hitchcock gets plenty of great shots, including the one from the underside of Perkins's face while his jaw twitches nervously and many others. It's hard to imagine a better executed film, and this is one that I never get tired of watching.",10,1,1,16 November 2019
Love Actually," Charming and inspiring
","What a charming movie this is. It's not perfect or anything, and probably gets a little too syrupy towards the end, but it's romantic, funny, and the star-studded cast is outstanding. Weaving through so many story lines could have left the viewer confused and unsatisfied with any of them, but director Richard Curtis pulls the right strings and keeps us entertained from beginning to end. There are just so many wonderful scenes and lines. Andrew Lincoln's card scene with Keira Knightley. Colin Firth watching Lúcia Moniz walk out of his life, and then later both of them learning each other's language. Thomas Sangster, the little boy, talking to Liam Neeson about the 'total agony of being in love'. Hugh Grant the Prime Minister going door to door to find the sweet and sometimes foul- mouthed Martine McCutcheon. And on and on.The movie is filled with all those little moments we can identify with – secret longings, flirtation, and first kisses – but also those that are bittersweet, and those that disappoint us. The overall theme of the movie, that 'love actually is all around', even though we often focus on the incidents of hate in the world, is inspiring. The shots in London are gorgeous, and the comic relief provided by the aging rocker Bill Nighy is funny. It is a feel- good movie and bound to be criticized, but it's OK to feel good once in awhile :), and this is certainly one of the better done romantic comedies.",9,1,2,20 June 2017
There Will Be Blood," Greed and fundamentalism
","A story which shows us a couple of the pillars America was founded on, unabashed greed and religious fundamentalism. Paul Thomas Anderson really transports us to the oil fields of the late 19th century, and the performance from Daniel Day Lewis is stellar, leading a very strong cast. The film reminded me of 'Citizen Kane' in its scope of an ambitious man's life, from the early days of finding his fortune to fighting and clawing his way to riches, and 'The Treasure of the Sierra Madre' in how greed perverts his soul. Its epic feel and high production quality certainly make it worthy of being discussed among such great old films.I found the relationship between the misanthropic oilman (Lewis) and a faith healer (Paul Dano) fascinating; both seem like flim flam men who manipulate the crowds around them, and their gamesmanship shows itself in a need to dominate and humiliate the other. The oilman is the apex predator in his world, but looming are the bigger fish of Standard Oil and the robber barons who threaten to snap him up. I'm not sure the story is quite as good or as well told as the beautiful cinematography and excellent acting, but the film was interesting for all of its 158 minutes. In the end, where does all of the battling and wealth accumulation lead in a man's life? And can one be successful in the capitalist world and remain a humanist? This film gives answers that are as dark as that pool of oil spewing out of the earth.",8,0,0,26 June 2020
The Bridge on the River Kwai," Entertaining and beautiful, but some real issues with tone and the portrayal
","Highlights:
<ul><li>Cinematography. Fantastic jungle scenes. The massive flock of birds scattering during a surprise encounter with the enemy was my favorite.</li></ul><ul><li>Dramatic climax. You have to suspend disbelief a bit, but it's gripping, suspenseful, and well-told.</li></ul><ul><li>Alec Guinness. Brilliant character, brilliant acting. His scene walking stiffly out of the hot box is fantastic.</li></ul><ul><li>The theme of maniacal devotion to duty blinding one to what's right. Obviously in Guinness's character, and in a minor key, the leader of the commando force (Jack Hawkins).</li></ul><ul><li>The whistling of the 'Colonel Bogey March.' A little crazy, but catchy. Also perfectly symbolic of the above two items.</li></ul><ul><li>Sessue Hayakawa. Just seeing the legend at age 71 was great and he has some nice early scenes, but it's too bad his character was so limited (part of the lowlights).</li></ul><ul><li>The context. It sits at an interesting crossroads between highly patriotic work of the 1940's, and deeper satire of military madness (e.g. Catch-22) and the disillusionment of the 1960's. Aside from the leaders being a bit off-kilter, one young solider says 'I suppose I find it hard to kid myself that killing isn't a crime,' and it's clear the escaped American (William Holden) wants no part of further battle.</li></ul>Lowlights:
<ul><li>Treatment of the Japanese. They're shown as incompetent at building bridges, and weak at controlling the prisoners. It's remarkable how little the Japanese are present in the film. Also remarkable is how much control the British commander has in his interactions with them, and in just strolling around. In one scene, Hayakawa privately weeps in frustration. These things are simply ludicrous and seem to me to stem from feelings of racial superiority.</li></ul><ul><li>Overall lightness of tone. After the opening scenes it's almost a cartoon, and I think it did the real-life POW's and civilians who worked under horrific conditions a real disservice.</li></ul><ul><li>William Holden's character. He's the cool American who enjoys seeing a woman after escaping, hanging out in loafers, and acting in ways that are decidedly un-military. On the trek through the jungle on the daring mission, he's soaped and shampooed in a natural pool by a lovely young Thai woman, one of several who are (of course!) helping carry the gear. It's ridiculous.</li></ul>",7,1,4,20 February 2019

Army of Darkness," Too silly
","I like how Sam Raimi didn't just trot out another cabin movie per the usual kind of horror film formula, and I also like how he wasn't afraid to retell the ending of the last movie when setting up this one. I really hoped to like this one more, given what I thought was a creative transition back to the year 1300. His special effect work is pretty cool as usual, and I think my favorite moments were when the false books attack. There are also all sorts of homages in here which were interesting to see, e.g. the stop motion animation work of Ray Harryhausen with skeletons in Jason and the Argonauts, Errol Flynn as Robin Hood, and the Three Stooges.For me though, it just wasn't my kind of film. It shifts the tone of the previous movies from horror/comedy, with emphasis on the horror, to action/comedy, with emphasis on the comedy - and the comedy is too damn silly for me to find funny. The film seems to go out of its way to be stupid, having the main character say cheesy lines like 'gimme some sugar baby' before having sex with a woman he's met, and all sorts of other bits that I groaned over. The story and action scenes end up being pretty standard too, certainly not keeping up with the special effects, though I have to say, I loved the ending.",4,1,1,16 April 2020
Kong: Skull Island," Nice monsters, weak script
","A passable enough action film if you just want to plug into some decent battles between giant monsters, but be forewarned, I think even an action junkie will have to overlook quite a bit to love this film. I'm open-minded about sequels and imagine that Merian C. Cooper and Ernest B. Schoedsack (directors of the outstanding 1933 original) would have loved to have the technology that went into this film available to them, but for me, ultimately 'Kong: Skull Island' wasn't all that satisfying. Unfortunately, far more effort was put into the CGI, battle scenes, and setting itself up for sequels than there was in the script, creating what are more than one-dimensional characters, and giving those characters motivations that made sense. It's too bad that the creativity used to create cool monsters wasn't used to avoid plot holes and clichés. Taken in the right spirit or with the right people (e.g. friends who can laugh at the silliness or maybe a young teen), there is some entertainment value here, but one can't help but wish the film was a complete package.",5,0,0,7 December 2017

Parasite," Powerful
","Such a powerful allegory for the increasing wealth gap in the world. The scenes in the basement were chilling, especially that first one. The poor scurrying like cockroaches when the lights come on, swimming in their own filth during that flood scene, and turning against one another ... it was all devastating commentary on the position they're in, and the struggle. The rich guy who seems nice enough, but just the mere smell of the poor, or them not staying in their place and crossing the line he has in his mind which makes him quickly remind them of their relative positions ... it's a fantastic characterization, and I loved how it all built up into a crescendo with the opulence of that kid's birthday party. This is a message film that works on both levels, as it's hard to know how it will play out, and while dark, it's entertaining. The ending is brilliant too.",9,3,7,3 December 2019
Wonder Woman," Hit and miss
","I know this is a little different from the popular view, but I thought 'Wonder Woman' was just OK, though a decent way to spend summer afternoon. I liked a woman superhero, the diversity in the movie, and the character of the God of War, and how he debated the nature of humanity with Wonder Woman towards the end. On the other hand, it was too long, had some corny parts that should have been cut, and was kind of standard action hero fare, which are getting so common these days. There was this really touching scene of her dancing in the snow at night with the spy, and then I thought Director Patty Jenkins spoiled it by not just leaving it as it was, and instead showed them going upstairs to make love. I just thought that was cliché and unnecessary, just like the double entendres when he's standing there naked with his watch ('you mean you let that little thing tell you what to do?'). I also thought it was ironic that this version of Wonder Woman is hailed as the non-objectified version, when she's wearing a skimpy skirt, still has big breasts on full display, and is always perfectly made up. It's hit and miss, and I would also note, not appropriate for little kids, much as we may want to show them a female superhero.",6,1,6,28 July 2017
Raging Bull," Fantastic acting and many memorable moments
","This is a great film on a number of levels – as a biography of former middleweight boxing champion Jake La Motta, yes, but also a fascinating character study, with stellar performances from Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci, and epic direction from Martin Scorsese. The opening sequence sets the stage for something special; De Niro is dancing in place alone in the ring in poetic slow motion, we see the film will be in black and white and there is a smoky haze in the background as the opening credits roll. We will soon see just how crazy this man is, as he turns over the dining table in a fight with his first wife over how long to cook his steak, yells down at his complaining neighbor that he's going to kill and eat his dog, and then goads his younger brother (Pesci) into punching him in the face as hard as he can. Throughout the movie, the dialog between De Niro and Pesci is loud, confrontational, argumentative, and fantastic. The times were certainly different, and La Motta was part blunt New Yorker and part Cro-Magnon. He makes out with his wife on the floor in front of his sister-in-law and their toddlers. He's insanely jealous, and accuses his brother of having had sex with his wife (lines I will never forget, and sometimes quote: 'I heard things Joey, I heard things'  'What things you heard?'  'I heard some things'). After confronting his wife, she 'confesses' out of frustration, so he marches over to his brother's house and beats him up, also punching his wife in the face in the process, all in front of his brother's stunned kids. La Motta met his second wife Vikki when she was just 15, and married her when she was 16. In the film she's played well by Cathy Moriarty, though she seems much older (she was only 20 at the time though). In another unforgettable scene, this one erotically charged, she kisses his body when he's not allowed to have sex before a fight, and then after he goes to the sink to pour ice water down his shorts to cool off, shows up in the mirror and begins kissing him some more. Scorsese uses a perfect amount of restraint here, however, and we never 'see' anything. Unfortunately, he doesn't apply this same restraint to violence in the right, overstating it considerably, even considering the type of fighter La Motta was. We see blood spraying as if it were out of a hose, and boxers enduring more punishment than humanly possible. Maybe this is how Scorsese the man saw boxing, having not been a fan beforehand, or Scorsese the artist preferred to paint the violence of the men involved in the sport. Regardless, it was not necessary. That said, seeing De Niro at the end of the last bout with Sugar Ray Robinson (Johnny Barnes), his face a meatloaf, eyes puffed over but grinning like a ghoul as he tottered over to Sugar Ray, taunting him despite the beating he just took, saying 'ya never got me down Ray', is another memorable moment.Cut to 6 years later, a fat La Motta is poolside in Florida smoking a cigar, having retired. The legend is that De Niro gained 60-70 pounds over 4 months by eating high-end food in France and Italy, and it's just another larger-than-life aspect of this movie. It's painful to watch his awkward stand-up act, his crude jokes, his philandering with women in the bar, and getting thrown into jail for having let young teenagers into his bar (they having 'proved' being of legal age by French kissing him). His beer belly hangs out of his shirt while he's in a pay phone. Like an idiot, he hammers the jewels out of his championship belt, looking to pawn them, and not understanding they're worth far more in the belt. He's estranged from his brother, and the scene with De Niro following Pesci out of a convenience store down the street is heart wrenching.The film ends with De Niro quoting Brando in 'On the Waterfront' as he practices his stand-up act in front of a mirror. He does it with just the right amount of poor delivery (he's acting as La Motta after all) and pathos, it's another great scene, but I have to say, the words themselves ring false - La Motta's brother WAS looking out for him, among other things beating the hell out of some guys in a nightclub when they were getting too close to his wife, and La Motta did NOT end up with a one-way ticket to Palookaville after throwing a fight for the mafia, he ended up with a title fight a couple of years later and won it. Scorsese may have included too much violence, but he does so many other brilliant things. Black and white was an excellent choice. He uses slow motion to create an epic feel to moments. He uses stills of some of the boxing victories, and footage altered to appear as if it's from old home movies to show events in some of the intervening years. He tells the story with brutal honesty. Most of all, he gives outstanding actors freedom, and they really delivered.",9,4,7,16 June 2016
Straight Outta Compton," Fantastic movie, whether you're a fan of the music or not
","This is a movie which will grip you even if you're not a big fan of rap pioneers NWA, Dr. Dre, Ice Cube, and Snoop Dogg. If you are a fan, you'll probably be in heaven. Either way, I highly recommend this movie, which has it all: great acting, a compelling story, riveting direction, and most importantly, honesty. It doesn't make excuses, but at the same time, you see the genesis for NWA's incendiary lyrics: blatant racism and brutality by the LAPD at the direction of Daryl Gates, vast economic disparity relative to other citizens of LA, and an environment of gang violence. Can you imagine being held at gunpoint by thugs entering your school bus because you had made a few gestures at them out your window? Being forced to the ground with hands behind your back by the police for no other reason than the color of your skin?You also see NWA's defense so eloquently put by Ice Cube (well, his son, O'Shea Jackson, Jr., who plays him brilliantly): they were simply reflecting their world, honestly, and were also protected by the First Amendment. There isn't a lot of visibility put into the misogynistic lyrics of the genre and these artists, but it is clear that they were young men acting out, and when we see the older Cube a family man, sagely reflecting back on a video he made was younger, we appreciate that. We tend to have barriers and stereotypes built up, demonizing others we don't understand particularly when they confront and challenge the status quo, and this movie really helps break those down. At the same time, the attitude and actions against women were the areas that I felt the artists got too much of a pass, and a perfectly honest movie would have included those elements.I liked seeing all of the personalities in what was a very special time in music history, similar to when McCartney met Lennon or Jagger met Richards. Fans of those bands, calm down, I'm not suggesting NWA reached the heights of the Beatles or Stones, but what an incredible influence they had on an entire genre from the crucible that was Compton in the 80's. You see the fiery lyrics of Ice Cube, the visionary genius of Dr. Dre, and the tragic story of Eazy-E. Corey Hawkins plays Dre and Jason Mitchell plays Eazy-E, and both are fantastic. You see great nuance in the character of the band's manager Paul Heller, played by Paul Giamatti, who advocates for them and advances them, but also ultimately screws them. You see the jealousies between the band members lead to a schism. You see Snoop Dogg (Keith Stanfield) arrive on the scene, and you see a real villain in Suge Knight (R. Marcos Taylor), who at first seems to be helping them get out of a situation in which they're being taken advantage of, but quickly does that himself, and in addition, exercise extreme violence in asserting his power. The quality of the acting is consistently high. The story itself is fascinating, and Director F. Gary Gray did a great job of figuring out what to leave in and what to leave out. Even though it's 147 minutes, which is long, you'll find it flies by and doesn't seem long, which is the sign of a great story-teller. It's quite surprising that none of these fine actors, the director, or the movie itself were even nominated for an Oscar, and quite right that that fact was widely protested. Definitely go see this movie.",9,16,43,28 February 2017
Mary and Max," Touching
","Because of some of the crass bits early on, I was a little worried that this was going to be a little too dark for my taste, but it turned out to be quite a touching portrait of loneliness and those with Asperger's. To feel isolated in the world, and yet to have an improbable friend in a pen-pal you've never met - just to know they're out there and to hear from them as you trundle through life - the connection is meaningful and beautiful. The film is also visually striking, and I loved the voices from Phillip Seymour Hoffman and Toni Colette.",8,0,0,5 May 2020
Jojo Rabbit," Heart in the right place, but falls flat
","A timely film, given the rise of populist leaders whispering vile things into the thoughts of the masses. It's set in Nazi Germany, but those who promote hatred and insanity over love and rationality in all generations - particularly this one - are probably the target here. It's a film about perseverance, showing us that all of these types of leaders will pass eventually, and for that it should get credit.The film is very ambitious in attempting both comedy and drama, and in such a highly sensitive context. For me, the comedy fell flat, and I didn't feel it was all that appropriate either. Its heart was in the right place and there were dark scenes to point out at least some of the atrocities which took place, but overall it felt just a little too glib. I was really squirming through the first half because I knew what it was going for, but didn't think it was adding anything insightful to the conversation. There are some nice moments in the back half, but by then it was too little, too late.The dancing quote from Scarlett Johansson's character was nice ('we have to dance to show God we are grateful to be alive'), but the dancing at the end - even with the Rilke quote - seemed way off in tone to me. It seems to forget that after such nightmarish horror and personal loss, there are long stages of bereavement before such joy can be expressed. It's hard for me to fathom what an audience in 1945 would have thought of it.",5,2,5,25 February 2020
Rear Window," Suspense all from the vantage point of a window
","Hitchcock's nod to voyeurism has a very simple premise: a photographer (Jimmy Stewart) is laid up with a broken leg, and finds entertainment in looking out his second floor window at his neighbors. The plot device is that during a heat wave, these neighbors leave their curtains drawn or shades up at all times, well, with the exception of a pair of newlyweds, whose implied activity (and its frequency) is a little joke Hitch gives us early on. He also dials up some eye candy circa 1954 with a dancer who regularly prances about her apartment. Stewart (slash Hitchcock) is a bit of perv, and he's kidded about that by his tough little nurse (Thelma Ritter) and glamorous girlfriend (Grace Kelly). Things get serious when he notices one of the neighbors (Raymond Burr) leaving his apartment multiple times in the wee hours of the night, and that the guy's wife has mysteriously disappeared.From then on, there is a tension to the film, as we're not sure what's going on, or if anything at all is going on, as Stewart's detective friend (Wendell Corey) is skeptical and provides some alternate explanations. You might say, c'mon, we're pretty sure something's going on, this is a Hitchcock film after all, but consider the uncomfortable light Stewart's character is placed in: spying on neighbors with binoculars and a gigantic zoom lens, suggesting that his friend break the law by searching the guy's apartment without a warrant, and even (gasp) having Kelly over for a little sleepover, despite only having a single bed. It would have been interesting had Stewart's character been darker, e.g. taking pictures of his neighbors, but that may be implied when he breaks out slides showing pictures of a flower garden in the courtyard to try to understand if anything has changed.Tension ratchets up considerably when Ritter and Kelly investigate on their own, but I won't spoil it. The fact that the action for the entire movies takes place in Stewart's apartment or from its vantage point is a pretty phenomenal achievement. Stewart turns in a strong performance, and Ritter's blunt speculations are effective in spurring our imaginations. I loved the scene which ends with Burr's cigarette glowing in the dark, one of the best moments in the film. The little stories playing out in the various apartments, including a woman who is lonely and depressed, provide interesting subplots. Overall the film is a little too constrained for me to consider it Hitchcock's best, and I could have used a little more darkness in the characters or the plot, but it's certainly very good, and a brilliant example of suspense not requiring fast-paced action or gore.",8,1,1,4 December 2017

Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," Landmark film
","How do you even review such a film? Hey, news flash, this was a great film, let me tell you all about it. One thing I'll say, it holds up over the years, and over repeat viewings. I loved how Lucas unfolded the story on the remote and arid planet of Tatooine, and the first half of the film is especially good, with all sorts of little things that add interest upon a re-watch.Some highlights overall:
<ul><li>The scene with Luke Skywalker looking out at the double sunset, contemplating his destiny, as we hear a soaring part of John Williams' soundtrack.</li></ul><ul><li>The band and all those aliens in the Mos Eisley space port.</li></ul><ul><li>The menace of Darth Vader, one of cinema's all-time great villains. One of the imperial guys is skeptical of the Force and says to him 'Don't try to frighten us with your sorcerer's ways, Lord Vader. Your sad devotion to that ancient religion has not helped you conjure up the stolen data tapes or given you clairvoyance enough to find the Rebel's hidden fort...' Vader responds 'I find your lack of faith disturbing,' and begins choking him from a distance. And how about James Earl Jones for the voice? Perfect.</li></ul><ul><li>That epic moment between Darth and Obi-Wan, with this line: 'You can't win, Darth. If you strike me down I will become more powerful than you could possibly imagine.' How all of this would tie into the sequels and prequels was also just brilliant.</li></ul><ul><li>Favorite bit of humor: C-3PO misinterpreting the cries of joy from the garbage compactor and saying 'Listen to them! They're dying, R2! Curse my metal body! I wasn't fast enough!'</li></ul>The second half of the film, starting with the bickering between Princess Leia and Han Solo during the rescue and from then on, gets to be a little cartoony and glossy for my taste, and to be honest I didn't think much of Hamill or Fisher's acting throughout the film ... but I feel as though I'm nitpicking, when I could have listed a lot more highlights that I almost take for granted now (the sand people, the whole concept of the Force, the character of Chewbacca, the amazing effects, Obi-Wan bamboozling the guards, the gravitas Alec Guiness and Peter Cushing bring to their parts, Luke swinging with Leia across that bridge ala true swashbuckling legends from Hollywood past, etc etc). Definitely a landmark film.",9,1,1,10 August 2019
Ran," Outstanding
","Glorious in its production value, devastating in its commentary on mankind. Greed, selfishness, cruelty, the will to power - these are the dominant traits in man, Kurosawa says, and it's statement about humanity in all ages, whether it be feudal Japan, the 1980's era cold war, or today. Peace and stability are short-lived, we live on a powder keg, and warfare and chaos are inevitable. It's a very dark work that's a joy to watch because of its outstanding visuals, haunting use of music, and excellent performances from a deep cast, including Tatsuya Nakadai (the elderly warlord), Mieko Harada (the wicked daughter-in-law), and Peter (the fool).The 5-6 minutes of chaotic warfare set to symphony music, followed abruptly by the audio cutting over to gunfire and the other sounds of war for another 5 minutes is some of the most moving battle footage I've ever watched. The battle scenes near the end are also magnificent, with the warlords assembling their forces on the plains and those fantastic shots of horseman and foot soldiers scampering forward like a swarm of army ants. Kurosawa is brilliant in using the landscape to show the green paradise we squander by killing one another, and the resulting hellscape of scorched ruins. The undulating hills and beautiful shots of clouds in the sky reflect a timelessness, almost as if they were gods looking down impassively on the madness below.We want to sympathize with the father who has been betrayed, but are told of the many acts of slaughter he committed in conquering his surrounding neighbors, and then in old age we see him make a serious of rash, irrational decisions, so instead we just watch in horror as he descends into senility and madness. While his first and second sons seem like the good, filial types and the third son scoffs and speaks a little too directly early on, note the little clue as to his better nature in the moment when the father has fallen asleep in the hot sun, and he cuts a few branches to erect a makeshift shade for him.There are very few such acts of kindness in the film, but Kurosawa does show us an alternative to all of the violence, and that's the way of peace taught by Buddha, who the other daughter-in-law (Yoshiko Miyazaki) is a disciple of. The scene at the end is a touch didactic and leaves no doubt as to Kurosawa's view on how enlightened we are, but what a lasting, fantastic image he creates.",9,1,3,10 January 2020
Annihilation," Great concept, but flawed
","Great concept, some great visuals, and it was nice to see women in the lead roles, but there are so many issues with tone, plot points, and the characters that it made it tough for me to like it. There were lots of groans in the first half from those I watched it with, and I don't think director Alex Garland helped himself with the way he told the story. It was pretty cool to contemplate an alien presence that interacts in such a fundamentally different and unexpected way, which was reminiscent of Lem/Tarkovsky's Solaris, and I also imagined a subtext of death being an annihilation of one's atoms, returning them to the universe, where they live on in myriad other forms. There's no poetry here though, just an Americanization of Solaris and Stalker, and I just wish it had been better executed.",5,2,3,12 December 2019

Y'know? Quentin Tarantino has made a lot of great films, and this one is right up there with his best. It has all of his trademarks - a fantastic cast, snappy dialogue, creative story-telling, excellent pace, a retro/cool soundtrack, and several 'big' moments. It also has a nearly perfect level of discipline and restraint, which make it that much better. Love Pam Grier, Samuel L. Jackson, Robert De Niro, Robert Forster, and Bridget Fonda in this. Tarantino the writer is as good as Tarantino the director, and his vision and aesthetic shine brightly, as they do in his other films. Very satisfying, fun, and entertaining.",9,2,2,2 March 2020
The Cabin in the Woods," For me, just another horror film
","I liked the homage to films like The Evil Dead and Ringu, but the premise to this film wasn't all that original, and I didn't think the attempt at satirizing the genre worked very well. It's a horror film that's self-aware, but too often it seemed to just become the thing itself, a dumb horror film. The human sacrifice to the Ancient Ones stuff was weird, and came at a point when the film had more than worn out its welcome.",4,0,3,16 November 2019
Moon," Lean, solid sci-fi
","Loved the premise of the story and the minimalism of its execution. The slow pace works for a film that has elements of isolation, paranoia, and uncertainty about reality. It's not perfect - I think Sam Rockwell was fine but at a couple of critical moments how he reacted didn't seem realistic. The main twist is revealed somewhat early as well, and GERTY is too close to HAL for me. Still though, the message of the film, relating to man's inhumanity, is devastating.",8,0,1,29 September 2019
Evil Dead II," Gory fun
","The moment that perfectly captures America in 2020: when the educated woman who can translate the ancient text to send the evil forces into the vortex is stopped by the good ol' boy in overalls with a shotgun who snarls 'I'm in charge now.'Lots of creative moments, cool effects, and gory fun. I preferred this one to the original, maybe because the story was tighter. The main drawback is the cast, none of whom can act to save their life. There is camp appeal to that though, and as the film never wants to be taken seriously, it allows itself to be zany and take chances out of sheer entertainment. I can see why true fans of the genre love it.",7,0,0,16 April 2020
High Fidelity," Quirky and well done
","This movie captures so perfectly the perspective of many who love music: to have such passion for a band, to take pride in knowing lesser known artists, their influences, and music trivia, and to snobbishly judge others for what they listen to, even though it's all of course personal and subjective. It's also a pretty good movie about the difficulty of relationships. John Cusack is talented, funny, and likable as a record store owner floundering his way through breakups, mainly because as much as he's an expert on music, he's a dunce about women. He often talks directly to the camera, drifting back to memories and musing over various 'top five' lists. The film also has a fantastic supporting cast, including Jack Black in his breakout role, Joan Cusack in some great scenes opposite her brother, Lisa Bonet, Catherine Zeta-Jones, and Tim Robbins among others. Quirky and well- done, this film has something for everyone.",8,2,2,1 April 2017
From Here to Eternity," Great film
","This is one of those films that seems perfect for the period. It has a few larger than life moments, starting with that iconic beach kissing scene, which is fabulous. It puts the lives of a group of soldiers, all far from perfect, as well as two love stories into the backdrop of the year leading up to the attack on Pearl Harbor. Lives are torn apart not only by conflicting desires, but by this big moment of history which looms for most of the film, giving it an epic feeling.The cast is fantastic, and very deep. Deborah Kerr, Donna Reed, Montgomery Clift, Burt Lancaster, Frank Sinatra, Ernest Borgnine, and several others in supporting roles, my god. Clift is the strongest actor in the group, such a natural, and in that first wave of method actors that included Marlon Brando and James Dean. Lancaster is perfectly cast, with that frame and jawline of his, and he delivers a very strong performance too. I also liked how Kerr and Reed were cast counter to their usual types.The film critiques the Army, and at a pretty surprising time - not so long after WWII, and during the period of McCarthyism and the Red Scare. The commanding officer has a new solder (Clift) hazed because he doesn't want to fight for the regiment's boxing team. The men carouse heavily, getting drunk and visiting hostess bars (a Code-required softening of the brothels that they actually are). A couple of them go AWOL, to their own peril. The sergeant in charge of the stockade (Borgnine) is sinister and administers cruel beatings in retribution for past arguments. The love interests that form - a sergeant (Lancaster) for his commanding officer's wife (Kerr), and a soldier (Clift) for a prostitute (Reed) - are far from innocent. And yet these are the people who will rally when the country is attacked.There is a vision of a generation being presented here, and at its heart is a scrappy toughness. Clift is mentally very strong as he takes the abuse, but sticks to his principles (he doesn't want to box anymore because he blinded someone in the ring once). We don't see this on the screen, but we're told that Sinatra takes repeated beatings and responds by spitting in Borgnine's face each time. Lancaster sticks up for his men in bar fights, and is the epitome of the perfect Army man - intelligent, resourceful, and managing upwards as well as commanding downwards. All of them drink heavily. Kerr calls her husband out for his adultery, sleeps separately from him, and goes out and has an affair of her own. Reed moved to Hawaii from Oregon on her own to make enough money to return and settle down, and even here we see shrewdness and courage. All of these characters have an edge to them. 'Gimme a nail,' Sinatra says, asking for a cigarette, referring to a nail in the coffin because of the dangers of smoking. 'Ain't you ever seen a dead man?' barks Lancaster to a group of his soldiers, and of course, to many of this generation, they had. In aggregate I think there is a sense of pride on display, even in the face of the flaws of the Army and these characters, but it seems on the whole honest to me. It was a time when heroes rose to the occasion, but the film does not sugar coat them as people.Unfortunately, the treatment of women isn't always exemplary, despite Kerr standing up to her husband. That famous beach scene segues to Lancaster jealously questioning her about her past lovers, and the double standard is soon on full display. In a smaller scene, the men ogle and comment about a waitress (Moana Gleason, who is one of very few Hawaiian actors in the cast, and even this role is teeny).Despite the production code, the film gives us plenty of edgy material, most notably the adultery and abuses of the military. At the same time, quite a bit of the original novel was excised: the abuse toned down, profanity removed, prostitutes being transformed into hostesses, and the real reason for the commanding officer's wife not being able to conceive again altered. I didn't really have a problem with any of that. The biggest issue was with changes made to the ultimate fate of the commanding officer, which was unfortunate but not something that derailed the film.The film may seem to wander a bit while director Fred Zinnemann advances the various story lines, but it never lags. There are lots of very good scenes and memorable moments. Clift dolefully playing taps to the company at night. The calendar being revealed in the background, when we may have lost track of or be unaware of what's coming (as I was, long ago, when I first saw the film). Sinatra rolling a pair of olives at the bar as if they were dice. And Lancaster and Kerr's comments to one another when they realize the limits of their affair, despite the passion they share: 'I have never been as miserable as I am since I met you, he says, and she replies, 'Neither have I.' 'I wouldn't trade a minute of it,' he says, and she agrees, 'Neither would I.'Great film, and as a side note, if you ever get a chance, I recommend venturing down to the beach at Halona Cove on Oahu. It's well worth re-imagining those moments from the film's most famous scene, and climbing on the rocks we see in the background.",9,0,0,21 January 2019
