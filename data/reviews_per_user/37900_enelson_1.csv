Casablanca," It doesn't get any better than this
","I first saw Casablanca when I was fifteen years old (after seeing it listed in a magazine as one of the greatest movies of all time) and consequently fell in love with the silver screen. It's plot is beautiful and intricate. The cinematography is wonderful and the acting, superb. To those who may believe that we live in cinema's golden age, I suggest you take a look at this hit of nearly 60 years ago.  You'll be pleasantly surprised.",10,1,1,15 April 2000
