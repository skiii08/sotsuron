Catch Me If You Can," The Cat and The Check-Forging Mouse
","Catch Me If You Can manages to reach the goal that most of the biographical films strive for. This film manages to captivate the viewer and present a dramatic retelling of the true events without sacrificing the important details that make the original story so appealing in the first place. Sure, it adds an additional historically inaccurate plotline, but these scenes don't take anything away from the experience and only enhance the events as the movie continues to unfold. I truly think that the quality of its screenplay is what makes it so memorable and charming.The main characters stand out and have just enough time to make an impactful impression on the viewer. From the naive mischievousness of Leonardo DiCaprio's portrayal of Frank Abagnale to the persistency and inspiring commitment of Carl Hanratty played by Tom Hanks. Both of the characters are almost perfectly suited for their roles in this long-running game of «cat and mouse» and the actors make sure that their impressive portrayal of Frank and Carl shows it. The performances also allow for every close call for Frank Abagnale and every small victory of Carl Hanratty to feel like the first one. Emotional hooks are already in you by the time Frank makes his first forged check and they aren't planning on letting you go until you're done with the movie.
Also, the original soundtrack is fantastic. Always nailing the tone of the scene, John Williams once again proves his talent as a composer throughout the film. From the beautifully animated intro sequence to the small, almost unnoticeable melodies that serve as wonderful background for this lighthearted story.Of course, you can probably guess how the story ends even if never knew the true story of Frank Abagnale. The film tries its best to leave you guessing up until the end whether or not will the story of the young check forger end on a high note, but it's obvious that the script never aimed to interpret original events as a complicated story about the morally gray nature of crime and/or a story with a strong focus on how your confidence and wit can help you find a way in and out of every situation in life. It's just a simply structures, feel-good movie with a cheeky tone that can be enjoyed by almost everyone and I'm all for that. It's a great watch and I'd highly recommend it to anyone who wants to see an engaging crime story and have fun. If that's what you're after, then Catch Me If You Can is the movie for you.",8,1,2,19 February 2019
