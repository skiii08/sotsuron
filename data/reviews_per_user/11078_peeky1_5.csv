The Incredible Hulk," a heart felt 3/10 for trying
","Back in 2003, filmmaker Ang Lee released 'Hulk,' the hugely budgeted adaptation of the Marvel comic book series created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby. Starring Eric Bana as Dr. Bruce Banner and Jennifer Connelly as his true love Betty Ross, the film was considered a box- office disappointment and mainstream audiences complained that the picture was too slow, ponderous and heady for their liking. Having just watched 'The Incredible Hulk' and then re- watched 'Hulk', the 2003 film now comes off as an astoundingly misunderstood achievement a complex, multilayered, visually extravagant, and ultimately quite moving operatic tragedy that transcends the norm of the genre. If all viewers really wanted was just a big, dumb, by- the-numbers action flick, then their wishes have been granted with 'The Incredible Hulk,' a creatively dull reinvisioning that pretends 'Hulk' never existed.Following an opening credit sequence explaining the backstory of how cellular biologist Bruce Banner (Edward Norton) was involved in a genetic accident that left him with the unstoppable ability to transform into a nine-foot-tall, green-skinned superhuman whenever his heart rate and rage level were raised, the plot proper picks up five years later, with Bruce in hiding in Brazil. As the hulk, he was responsible for multiple deaths and mass destruction, and General Thaddeus Ross (William Hurt)father of Bruce's now-estranged girlfriend Betty (Liv Tyler)has made it his life's mission to find and destroy him. When Bruce's whereabouts are finally located, he once again must go on the run, secretly returning to the U.S. in the hopes that the data he has collected will be enough to reverse his infection. With a reunited Betty once again by his side, they head for New York City to visit a scientist who may be able to help them. Hot on their trail is not only General Ross, but also cutthroat British soldier Emil Blonsky (Tim Roth), himself now injected with a strain of the same dangerous serum.Because 'Hulk' is only five years old, it is virtually impossible not to compare it to 'The Incredible Hulk,' particularly since the unwise decision was made to start the series over from scratch. 'Hulk,' as directed by Ang Lee, was rich in character work, narrative depth and a provocative subtlety that spoke louder than any words or explosions could have. At the same time, it was also gorgeous to look at, complete with comic book-inspired aesthetics and an overall sense of wonder and poeticism. 'The Incredible Hulk,' helmed by Louis Leterrier (2005's 'Unleashed'), hasn't any of those characteristics. The film is grittier, to be sure, but it is also emotionally wooden and visually forgettable, a CGI-heavy grab for the attention of teenage boys that has no concern for finding an identity of its own.The screenplay by Zak Penn (2006's 'X-Men: The Last Stand') is unimaginative and the story that is woven feels unnecessary, with little forward momentum taking place and none of the characters really growing any through the course of the running time. The special effects used to bring the Hulk to life are pretty good, and detail in body musculature and facial expressions are strong, but he really doesn't have much to do once the transformation occurs. The film lacks scope; the underwhelming action set-pieces have all been given away by the trailers and television ads, and they are all suffocating in their onslaught of CGI and dreary camera-work. The climactic battle on the streets of New York City between the Hulk and a now-monstrous Blonsky reminds of a poor-man's 'Cloverfield,' especially ironic since 'Cloverfield' was made for a fraction of the budget that 'The Incredible Hulk' had at its disposal. Watching two giant creatures face off, both whom are one step away from being invincible, just isn't very interesting, and director Louis Leterrier is additionally unsuccessful in bringing a grandeur to the proceedings or a rooting interest in how things turn out. Like 2007's 'Transformers,' it's just a lot of mindless chaos and freneticism lacking a heart or soul. Edward Norton (2006's 'The Illusionist') is a committed and passionate actor well-equipped to tackle the role of Bruce Banner, but the finished product does him no favours. It has been extensively documented in the press that Norton was battling the studio for final cut of the moviehe apparently had edited a 135-minute version that he much preferred to the 113- minute cut being releasedand all evidence points to him being valid in his opinions. As it is now, the film is dumbed-down and deficient in personality. As love interest Betty Ross, Liv Tyler (2008's 'The Strangers') shows a fiery flair in her reading of a character whose relationship with her father is strained and whose love for Bruce is the only thing to tame his out-of-control alter-ego. That Betty drops her current boyfriend (Ty Burrell) the second Bruce shows up without so much as a good-bye, however, seems awfully insensitive.'The Incredible Hulk' has a few effective scenes, such as a touching one between Bruce and Betty in a cave and a very funny one that makes a succinct comment on New York City cab drivers. What is so disappointing about the film, though, is how much of a lesser experience it is than 'Hulk.' From its uninspired writing to its plodding character interplay to its stock action to its horribly cheesy 'Hulk Smash' moment, the picture is mundane, predictable and empty. The title oversells the output. 'The Incredible Hulk' isn't incredible at all. In fact, he's discouragingly ordinary.The only high point came right at the end where a cameo appearance from Tony Stark (Iron man) propositions general Ross in regards of putting a 'team' together. So I guess in the coming summers we'll be sure to have a 'Captain America' and maybe a 'Thor' film building to an 'Avengers' movie. It put a smile on my face until I realised just how disappointing 'Iron Man' and 'The Incredible Hulk' have been.",3,9,17,28 June 2008
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Cringy
",Unfortunately a constant cringe fest from start to finish.,4,6,12,25 December 2019
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," And you thought Force Awakens was bad...
","Mum jokes??? 
If i'm cringing at a film in the first 5 minutes, then I have a very bad feeling about this. 
If i'm still cringing for 150mins then I should have left after 5 minutes.Never will I pay to watch a Disney film again!",1,5,6,23 January 2018
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Come back George, all is almost forgiven...
","Empty.That's how I feel inside.Like a part of me died in that theatre last night.So where to start?...I was unfortunate to see the Jurassic Park remake Jurassic World only a few weeks ago, and now I've been duped again but this time into watching A New Hope remake.A forgotten child on a sandy planet, finds a droid, droid contains plans to blow up giant death star, look for a pilot to help return droid, learn new powers, inserts weird family tie, blow up death star with x-wing, end.Only this time with a ton of pointless content, naff jokes and about 50 characters more than necessary, to sell more figurines.Even George Lucas' Episodes I, II and III had new content for us to digest and ponder over a beer.meh... I'm done! So a 2 year wait for Ep8 to find out Ray is also Leia and Han's kid, probably the good twin. Then Ep9 and the big reveal, Finn as a baby was taken from, wait for it, Bespin.....We've been Jedi mind raped on a global scale.",1,43,65,18 December 2015
Transformers: Dark of the Moon," a truly bad film
","All in all, a terrible movie which stinks due to no creativity, a lack of understanding of the laws of physics, woefully hammy acting, over use of close ups and shaky cam, a gimmicky sound track and some badly designed robots. I feel for all you parents out there who have just had to pay out ridiculous prices for tickets for your kids to go and watch this film, which in a nut shell is the exact same film as the last two. With few exceptions, a new love interest who looks oddly like a duck, acts like a duck and really has no place in this film, in fact most of the cast were just there as an after thought to try and salvage something from a badly written script. And an autobot that seemingly visited the SS Enterprise some time in the past, scanned and taking on the appearance of Spock. Bravo to the design team on that one..not! It seems like the industry are having one big laugh behind our backs. In fact, i'm going to terminate my post now as it's likely to become censored if I continue... if only we could rate stuff zero!..",Null,2,6,16 July 2011
