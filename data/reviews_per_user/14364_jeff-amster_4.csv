Sucker Punch," Girls and guns, what's not to like? But will it win an award?
","Some movies are destined to be Oscar winners being pinned to the walls of movie theaters across the country, while others are simply pinned up to the bedroom ceilings of teens. Sucker Punch definitely falls into the latter category, but with the depth of visuals and sound in this movie, even the most seasoned post-doctoral candidate can enjoy this film. Here's my take:* Tim Burton flick minus Danny Elfman? OK, so the film isn't done by Burton, but it still has the same dark imagery that you would expect from a classic Burton: dark plot (lobotomy ready for table #4)...jamstervision.blogspot.com/2011/07/sucker-punch-aka-13- year-old-geek-best",Null,1,2,14 July 2011
Public Enemies," Jamstervision: Tommy guns, dames, what's not to like?
",jamstervision.blogspot.comSo you're tired of 'The Man' and like it the way when the flappers were a flappin'? Wanna party like it's 1932? Public Enemies may be the trip you need to take you back to a time when Uncle Sam was getting their act together and the baddies were on top of the world! Here's my take:* You dirty rat... How relieved am I that everyone in this film didn't get into their 'I used to be a gangster for Halloween' stereotypical role! It was played off very cool and really brought me into the film that Johnny was a country boy gone bad and he held to his guns (literally) throughout the entire movie. This flick also really made me appreciate how poor the gangsters were at using guns back then...,Null,0,0,25 July 2011
Limitless," Limitless aka the 'Oh, that's what they meant by being a junkie' movie
","So, you're given a super drug that seemingly has no side-effects except for making you awesome. Sound crazy? Of course, but it's this type of escapism that allows people to take you on their journey and change their lives in Limitless! Here's my take:* Nancy Regan is rolling in her...oh she's still alive? Yo Holmes, just take this...everyone's doing it. At this point, normally you would 'Just Say No!', but of course if this happened, the movie would only be 5 minutes long! So for the sake of excitement, just put aside your goody-goody side and watch Eddie take on his roller-coaster of a life change including the fun with the Russian mob - gotta love the stereotyping...jamstervision.blogspot.com",Null,0,0,21 July 2011
Rango," Rango aka 'the don't cross me, I'm one badass chameleon' movie
","So you're a rough-and-tumble rustler, lookin' to establish some law and order down in this here parts of the Mojave? Fortunately, you got yourself a viewin' of Rango to keep you ahead of the herd, in this exciting tale of precipitation-challenged survival and the mystery that ensues! Here's my take:* Armadillo Roadkill = child-friendly entertainment? Though we have some fun looking, 3-D animated characters, please make sure to have your hands ready to cover your innocent daughter's eyes, because some scenes will probably surprise you (and at the same time give her...jamstervision.blogspot.com",Null,0,1,14 July 2011
