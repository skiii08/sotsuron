The Blair Witch Project," Good Movie..... but NOT Scary
","This is the best IDEA for a movie in a long time, but it never actually scared me.  Every part of the movie was amusing, very freaky, and convinced me that it was real while I watched it.  Yet, it was a good idea cause the creators exponential increased their profits in the first week alone, simply because millions of people saw it just because they didn't know what it was about! However I will admit that my friend left the theater shaking.",Null,0,1,25 August 1999
