Source Code," Brilliant Story, Brilliant Concept and Jake Gyllenhaal
","I watched this movie, not expecting some brilliant film. Rather I expected a typical Hollywood assembly line style movie. The concept seemed to similar to the likes of 'Inception' from the trailers I had seen. Now while at first the hook of this movie seems as though it will be one that drags... watching this 8 minute scene over and over. I believe the most exciting part was when Gyllenhaal's character (Colter Stevens or Sean) surprises his lady friend by predicting the future, (As he has relieved this moment in time over and over). I couldn't have been any more wrong about my assumptions with this movie. The idea itself behind the source code; being able to recreate the last 8 minutes of someones life as if it were a dwindling remnant of a light turned off, was a quite refreshing concept in itself. The movie's arc is Gyllenhaal's assignment to catch the man who planted the bomb, while we find multiple stories hanging off of this arc. We are given a few true touching moments throughout this flick that are all to relatable to each and everyone of us as well.Without spoiling to much of this movie i will simply say the stories concept with the 'Source Code' itself is the most refreshing part of this cinematic masterpiece. The Acting is superb, with no unintended humorous beats and it even may bring a tear to the light hearted. The ending of this movie is one that leaves your mind wondering. I would put this movie well above inception. It's definitely worth watching!",10,0,2,11 June 2011
