The Legend of Bagger Vance," Goofs
","Under goofs listed as incorrect it was suggested that the sun could be setting over the ocean. However, as this supposedly took place in Georgia, it hardly seems likely that the sun would be setting in the East. Also, among the many goofs that took place on the golf course, Jones and Hagen putted out before Junuh took his last putt. That never happened in the '30's and balls were likewise not marked -- which led to frequent stymies. I'm not sure why comments require 10 lines, but since they do I guess I'll have to add some filler. I liked the movie even though the outcome was pretty formulaic and the ending was obvious early.",8,0,1,2 July 2007
