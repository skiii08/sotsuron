Vertigo," Good organized
","I watched Alfred Hitchcock's films last year and studied about them. This summer, I wanted to watch some of them again so I chose this film. When I finished watching this film the first time, I could not understand its story and thesis so I watched it several times. While I watched several times, various ideas passed through my mind and some interrogative points were left. First of all, I found various interesting points in this film. It repeats the same story. Although sometimes lines are changed in the first and second halves, the same story is repeated twice. In spite of it, why do we lose interest? I think this is because of a good organization made by Alfred Hitchcock. While this is a suspenseful film, he reveals a secret in the middle of the story. The story is suspense told by Scottie at first, but it becomes a love story which is told by Judy in the latter of the story. I think because the similar story is written from a different viewpoint, we don't get tired of it. Finally, I totally recommend this film because it has a nice structure and we can study a lot of things from it. This film expresses various issues such as moral matter, fetishism, occultism and so on. These are complexly intertwined and formed a large spiral. If we watch it only one time, we don't understand its good point because, as you know, its theme is death and it's not comfortable. However, if we watch it several times and consider what Hitchcock wants to tell us and the meanings of each scene. This film is of course good not only for people who study films but also for general people who want to enjoy films.",8,2,4,16 September 2014
Taxi Driver," historical film
","When I finished watching Taxi Driver, I felt uncomfortable and I didn't understand this film. Firstly, I'm going to talk about the relationship between background and this film. This film was created in 1976 and at that time, there were the Vietnam War and the assassination. The main character, Travis Bickle, was a marine and he suffers from insomnia which is related to the seriousness of the war. Furthermore, his hair style is also the influence of the war. In 1972, Arthur Herman Bremer tried to assassinate George. C. Wallace and becomes the first and only one person who becomes a free man again. Mr. Bremer said at the time of his trial that his motive was to become a celebrity, and many observers have noted the pernicious, if unintended, effect that intense media attention has had, glamorizing assassins and inspiring copycats. Finally, I have some comments and questions. First, what did Martin Scorsese want to tell us? The meaning of this film is unclear and the ending story is really terrifying and annoying so I don't like it but I think he tells us that there are a lot of evils which is allowed in our society. On the other hand, it has some good points. I like camera works of Travis's sight which seems to a real world and a fantasy. The long mirror scene is also funny. In addition, I like the sticker on his cloth at the end. It is nice to watch this film and compare with history but sometimes you have to see brutal scenes.",7,0,3,16 September 2014
Psycho," surprising
","I cannot decide whether Psycho is good film or not. It is easy to understand the story of this film but a word and existence of psychopath has been spread by this film and it has made the world that allows to reduce a punishment because of psychopath. While I was watching this film, I was frightened because I felt as if I would be killed by someone. In other words, I feel realism when I watch this film. One thing which has us felt realism is camera-work and sound effects. For example, Hitchcock connected a lot of short scenes without a break, which is called montage. It relieves tension of frightening and also a monochrome relieves it too. While Hitchcock removes scares a little, he leaves some fright points. Another thing is angles. In this film, a main character is not decided, so the story is described by a few people' angle and our sympathies for the person who is described mainly then are switched immediately. Finally, I'll mention about the whole picture of this film. I think this film is composed of three parts. As I mentioned before, the main character is not set clearly so our sympathies change quickly. I think the main character is Norman. In the first part, Marion is described mainly, however, she is not the main character any more in the after parts. After that, the main is Norman. I don't know the meaning of the first part. I wonder Hitchcock can make it more surprising.",7,0,1,16 September 2014
