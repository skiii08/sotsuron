Captain Phillips," The poor ones on the bad side, again
","It's kinda racist movie. When you talk about people making bad thing you should ask yourself about reasons. Why a gang of human beings choose piracy against any other option? In the background exists a very deep social problem where everyone, European, American, and even us are guilty. If you told just the consequences, like they made here, then you have created another American superheroes movie and have told just a half of the human story. Just a half of the misery. Taking the bad side from the consequences of the poor policies against the humanity who lives in Africa, the land we all were coming from.",7,1,1,20 November 2017
Train to Busan," An individualist Broker running away from zombies
","A typical American movie from the Korean's point of view, that's enough to pay my ticket. Beyond the zombie cinematic, and great and atypical action scenes, Train to Busan contains some critics to the western culture. In one of them It makes a critic to the individuality through the role of a Broker, a Korean in an typical American job, who fights for his only life and that of his daughter, forgetting the life of anybody else. Every man for himself or a sense of community. American perspective or Asian fellowship culture.",7,1,2,25 April 2017
Mother!," What the hell is this movie about?
","I can say it, I understood many things the director tried to give us before I read about it. In the weirdest moments you should try to understand why all those things are happen. The metaphor is, at the end, less complex that you think. The point for this movie is to watch it knowing that a metaphor exists and all those moments are happening for a reason.",7,0,3,31 October 2017
Her," Showing us how important is a voice in our life
","It's wonderful when you watch a movie focused in a central story while parallel stories happen before your eyes, like the old fashion Hollywood movies. Theodore is the main role who interact with a sexy Operative System full of Artificial Intelligence, but his friends and all his society is being captivated at the same time. If you feel alone you can feel just like Theodore. If you have Siri but in disuse, you could feel the temptation to start talking more often with your personal assistant hoping to fall in love.",9,0,0,2 May 2017
