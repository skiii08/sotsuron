Sucker Punch," Sucker Punched!
","Although i'm not a huge fan of Zack Snyder's previous works (Watchmen,300, and Dawn of the Dead) i have to say i did enjoy the film. You have to know you are gonna find a film full of pop culture references. For example, Charlie's Angels, Moulin Rouge, scenes that seem to be taken from a Quentin Tarantino film(specially Kill Bill) or a Peter Jackson production(LOTR). For instance, the part were Baby Doll must escape from a dragon looks like a mix between Peter Jackson's LOTR and Mike Newell's Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire. The film is also very influenced by Japanese anime and manga. The most clear example is the costume of Baby Doll.Some people may find weird the way Zack Snyder combines the reality, sub-reality and the fantasy world of a 20 years old girl who leads a team that tries to run away from a psychiatric center in the early 60's. In the way they would have to travel through all kind of different worlds, and fight all kinds of creatures, from steampunk soldiers to futuristic robots!Even though the plot is pretty simple its impossible to predict whats gonna happen in the following sequence because all the time Snyder surprises you with even a craziest scene, helped by pretty realistic CGI animation.Maybe its not a film for everybody, but if you liked Snyder previous works you will enjoy this fantasy-action film that seems taken from a bizarre Japanese comic!What did i like most? The way the soundtrack(specially at the very beginning) complements the story.What did i hate most? Maybe its too long, probably i would cutoff some minutes, in particular some action parts.",7,4,11,24 March 2011
