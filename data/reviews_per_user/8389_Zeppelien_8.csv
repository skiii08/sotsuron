Scarface," This is what you call a 'Movie'
","This guy Al Pacino is a real legend,fits in every single kind of role.The best actor ever,I'm a big fan of clint eastwood & Leonardo dicaprio but this guy is beyond them.Showed you money isn't everything,yes it is but earn it through a respectable way,live your life without life threats all the time,nobody's out there in this world you could trust.'Don't talk to me about trust'.his dialogue delivery was superb,his acting was so awesome I can't express it in words here.Credit goes to the script writer,somebody go over him & give him Oscar.The movie was funny also,he made the dialogues look like he wrote them himself.Lessons in the end,& the jokes he made to his wife,I've been laughing all the time like an idiot.When he first met the girl in club & the comment he made on her was freaking funny,but after the movie finished,I forgot all the funny moments,in this line,you are never ever going to survive,you will die the other way.His comments 'what am I living for,drinking,eating,f'ing,sucking & the things he said to people in restaurant when he was drunk touched my heart.that's how the society is,this is how we all are.I'm gonna pay you 400000 more it'll make 800000 & you can buy the supreme court then.awesome dialogues in the end.awesome awesome movie,GTA Vice city was copied from this film I guess,first & last mission kind of thing in first & last scene.same setup.unbelievable,this guy is a real hero.nobody in this world is out there,whom you can trust,awesome",10,1,3,17 April 2014
Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid," One hell of a damn awesome movie
","I've watched many western movies & I find 6 out of 10 movies good to watch with a better story,some movies just waste your time,they try to make the running time longer & you end up watching a b grade movie.This movie had variations,special effects I'd say,the time when Butch tells Sundance I can't shoot,like he never killed anybody ,while they're trying to protect the money from Spanish bandits,when they fire & all the dust & slow motion effect blows your mind away,you know I watch movie,not thinking I'm in 2014 & these ppl should've had sniper rifles in their hands,where is the supersonic BMW etc.The chase was really good,learning process of Espanol & when they robbed the Spanish band,mistakes made by butch were quiet funny.While they were running from hired killers I was feeling like I'm running.& there's a spot,mountain where they climbed & went up top,that mountain is the same mountain from the 'The Naked Spur (1953)'s first scene.They used excessive dynamite,that part was funny too.Awesome worth watching movie,according to 1969's ERA,everything in this movie was at it's best.great story,good acting.Gives you a lesson,you can't run from the law,you'll end up running & dying later.",10,0,1,17 April 2014
Snatch," Amazing script
","By the time movie started,I was having problem understanding the movie,I had to get the subtitles for it,it wasn't easy to get what they were saying.Perfection!what an amazing story it was,the most funniest crime kind of movie I've ever seen.the accidents were awesome,what a fantastic thinking view of the director.Credit goes to the story writer also.I've been laughing throughout the movie.the accent was awesome.Though I had problems in listening but it was OK!The story writer gets the award & bullet dodger was awesome guy.awesome amazing fantastic funny crime movie.dog part was also awesome,worth watching the movie,didn't get bore for a second.throughout the whole movie,Jason was the man who wasn't even able to kill the villain or even threat him,I like this thinking by writer,every time hero is the guy who threatens the villain & there's always a bit of tension on both sides.loved the story,credit goes to director & writer.amazing.it was good to watch hero's hand cuffed.black guys were best,they made me laugh",9,2,5,19 April 2014
Cast Away," I don't have words
","Maybe I was never going to watch this movie,my brother had downloaded this movie & I was just checking hard where I found this movie,asked my friend about it & he said,it's a good movie,I asked who is hero,he replied,'Tom hanks' & I decided to watch the movie. When I started watching this movie it seemed quiet funny,I was smiling,laughing but I ended up crying.I watched same kind movie,that guy was also alone w/ his boat,& in the end he gave up himself but he saw a torch light searching him when he was drowning in depth of sea,like it,'127' hours was also good. But this movie gives you lesson at the end time of movie,that volleyball when left him & he was crying,I cried too,I love tom hanks,his acting is superb,wonder why this movie didn't win Oscar.why,why,why. The love to his wife was,it was awesome,when you love someone only in that case you'd be able to understand what lesson this movie is giving you.10/10.my eyes are hurting because I cried so much after so many days!",10,5,8,19 March 2014
Duck You Sucker," An Underrated Classic Western
","The movie was funny,it had action,emotions,laughter & dynamite.It was a classic,revolution came,a bandit becomes a hero for poor people.The concept given in the movie was so brilliant......Sacrifice is always for poor & those who study books come lately to poor ppl & they tell them 'hey,it's the time for revolution'.Who will die?the poor......'When the rich wage war,it's the poor who die,meanwhile the leader just talks away,Stuttering and mumbling for nightly news to replay,And the rest of the world watching at the end of the day,Both scared and angry like 'What did he say?' I was thinking the movie will be a gold rush kinda movie but you've my word,they movie had the most awesome story,no killing for money,for gold for nothing but revolution...........It was a classic,fantastic movie,wonder why it's so underrated.Excellent story 'For those who rated low 'DUCK YOU SUCKERS'",10,1,4,21 April 2014
Donnie Brasco," Excellent Movie With Excellent Cast
","AL PACINO has turned out to be the best actor till today,his acting is flawless.His acting was so real made me feel the movie.didn't bore me for even one second.He wasn't a boss this time but his acting showed he is boss in acting history...Johny deep's acting was also very awesome,he didn't get nervous,never let anyone smell he is an undercover FBI agent. At the end of the movie,I've forgotten all the funny scenes from the movie.it was the best by Pacino,he looks like real gangster in every movie,he was & he is the best actor.Insulting blue for that shirt was the most funniest scene from the movie,'That shirt,that's the shirt barber gives you to put over your shirt' & when he is freezing in room due to malfunction in A.C he says to donnie 'And I know you know I know you know'.Je was so damn brilliant in the movie,superb story,amazing guys,what a cast & what a finish.$500 reward & a medal,that's what you get in the end for the hard job,you left family,had quarrels with your wife,your life got messed up,your life was at stake several times,you had to punch a senior officer,many got killed because of you,you had to cut dead bodies,you broke the trust of a person who had even cooked for you.whenever he had even 100 bucks he gave you 50.& what you get for all this in the end?$500,000 open contract of your head?Salute to original F.B.I guy.& hats off to director,actors,I can spend night writing in favour of this movie.Excellent!!!",10,0,1,23 April 2014
All Quiet on the Western Front," An Ultimate Masterpiece
","Wars from the all over the world have a bad history.the movie showed how soldiers were treated,what was the value of a soldier at that time.'FEAR' is our greatest enemy.even trained officials get scared when they are paying duties on front.The movies showed the actual picture behind the war.You can judge the feelings of soldiers when they are eating,drinking & thinking only 'death'.Even those who say we aren't afraid of death get scared in war field.it's very easy to just say than do it practically.Government sends you to fight for your country,die for your country & they take your life's value as a chicken's life.The movie was very very awesome,10/10,emotions,fear,glory,sacrifice,death.You can only know the real pain if your leg gets cut in war zone,you die in war zone for your people.About the movie,it covered all the aspects of real life of a soldier.he went back home & saw that the world isn't changed,even he doesn't wanna die but he prefers to go back to the battlefield......World is hell,nobody will ever even care about your life sacrifice for your country & it's truth.awesome movie,can't believe the story was so powerful even in 1930s.Take it as a real story of people who sacrificed their lives for nothing but just wars for borders & boundaries,politics.Millions of lives get wasted so badly for nothing.Just two simple guys fighting each other,killing eacother for nothing........'I didn't want to kill you,we could be brothers if it wasn't a war,we'd just be friends' what an awesome movie.the best in it's own!!!",10,2,2,30 April 2014
The Silence of the Lambs," What a waste
","I was looking for some good thriller,action wasn't necessary but look at the story.Dr.lector or whoever his name was,gets a pin,screws 2 cops with a pin which came out of nowhere,highly trained cops get deceived,applause for both cops & rest of cops. Now what if one of those cops was a hero?mr.doctor'd never ever had a chance to break out,he calls the other cop to shut the damn cage & he is playing there,so sensitive that the money spent on his training was depending on just a door slam,why the hell you're in police department? why the hell'd you take a risk to place food near such a dangerous criminal,I mean he can go f*** his paintings & drawings,here's your food,2nd time you've asked for it,take it if you want to. & that mr genius serial killer,a brave FBI agent got deceived twice by him,breathing like untrained person,& that genius,never got caught,at the end used his brain to cut the power but forgot to load his gun,waow,genius,you're such a hero.he moves & instead of holding her breath,she's breathing like hell.oh come on,who'd give this movie so many points man.I've seen 1000s of movies,same story,2 turning points in the damn movie but not even a single one made sense.........waste",8,1,5,22 March 2014
