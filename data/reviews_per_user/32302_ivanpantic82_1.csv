Skyfall," On average, average.
","I'm going lower than the average here. Definitely not the best Bond movie; it's not even that great of a movie in general.The script was the most problematic part. Many plot points, especially to do with computers, make no sense. The bad guy is a standard movie hacker, who can use his hacking magic to do anything he wants. They go out of their way to portray the UK government as an underdog against this one 'terrorist' and his mercenaries (of course, the audience sympathies with the underdog, duh). It's ridiculous and makes no sense. They really need the Soviets back (retro/alternate history Bond, anyone?), or at least grow some balls and go after China. These lone terrorist plots are getting stale.Even if we disregard that as plot convenience, the script still sucks. The whole plot supposedly revolves around some kind of 'NOC list' (like in Mission Impossible), but this is forgotten halfway through the movie. It is hinted the bad guy is M's son, but not explained. Main contention between the two touched upon, but not fully developed. Bond's titular love interest features for about 20 minutes and is quickly disposed (no emotional reaction even hinted). What should have been the love interest is underdeveloped and ultimately pointless. Instead of her, for the culmination, we are introduced to a whole new character who hasn't even been hinted at and really serves no purpose. Outside of Bond and M, all side-characters are shallow and useless.Good parts of the movie revolve around Craig as Bond. He's good, no doubt there. The theme of the movie (the old ways VS the new ways) is ambitious enough, if poorly executed. Action scenes are OK within their PG-13 confines.Really, there's nothing fundamentally wrong with this movie, if we take it as a simple action blockbuster. I guess it kept me engaged enough in its dumb inept way. Craig and the overall theme maybe pushes it a point further, but no more. Critics' accolades are totally undeserved in this case.",6,1,17,3 February 2013
