It," I'm surprised how much I enjoyed this movie
","'It' actually feels like a real movie that just happens to be scary, which is how the best horror movies are. The writing, the acting, the thrills, and the cinematography are all very spot on. I'm especially impressed with how well all the child actors performed. As far as scariness goes, it's not necessarily super scary, but almost every scene manages to be thrilling in some way, so overall it's very intense and very fun. I would definitely recommend it",8,1,2,4 April 2019
