The Ring," Amazingly Horrifying
","When you switch your TV on and pop this DVD/cassette into the player, you could never imagine what things await you when you watch this film. Not only are the images extremely horrifying, the whole idea of the film sends shivers up your spine. In the film, a tape is featured that when watched, the victim dies in seven days. That right there is a skin crawling effect. Spookily good makeup artists bring the haunting character of Samara Morgan to life, and undead young girl gone bad. The whole affect of rotting flesh and the hair-in-front-of-the-face thing is creepy but extremely compelling. The Ring is just one of those Horror film prodigies you for sure won't want to miss.",10,0,1,7 March 2006
