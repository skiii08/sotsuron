Angels & Demons," Factchecking Aside, A Pretty Good Thriller
","Being neither a fan of conspiracy tales or particularly of the earlier novel 'The Davinci Code', I was less than optimistic that I would become a big fan of this new effort by Ron Howard and Tom Hanks. So it was a bit of a surprise to find 'Angels and Demons' is not a bad film at all. But it surely stretches credibility with its quasi- and at times pseudo-historic underpinnings. This is story-telling at warp speed; sometimes you want to have the film rewound for a few frames to verify what has been said by Tom Hanks' (as Roger Langdon).Langdon's frenetic pace to prevent killings of high priests in the Vatican is the meat of the story(s). Thrown in to crank up the action a little further is the theft of antimatter, of course of much interest to all. And there are outward and internal tensions caused by the Swiss guard, Vatican figures gathered to select a new pope also have in- and external issues. And then of course there arethe Illuminati.With all these characters embroiled in catching a serial killer (who focuses on highly-placed priests) working for who-knows-who, we have the makings of a pretty good thriller. And if you can decipher Langdon's rapid-fire explanations as to why the pursuit should be conducted his way, you are ahead of his law enforcement colleagues.There are two exceptions, naturally. Langdon's physics-oriented partner – involved initially with the theft of antimatter she had a hand in developing (Ayelet Zurer as Vittoria Vetra)- quickly demonstrates a remarkable knowledge of Church history. Ewan Mc Gregor, who is acting essentially as the acting Pope, also understands seems to understand what is going on.The fun is in listening to Langdon's rapid delivery of his analysis of the crime scenes and the criminal, and how and why it is all tied together. There are a number of so-called facts spouted that may or may not be true; but that is to be expected in both the novels of Dan Brown and the subsequent films.The opening shots of the film are right on the money, conveying a real sense of the inner workings of a lab specializing in quantum physics. Credit this work to the director; Ron Howard does know how to make a film.Three Stars.",8,2,5,5 June 2009
Kill Bill: Vol. 2," All Eyes On Darryl
","I have never seen Splash, nor can I even recall Darryl all that well in her early years.  But mama look at her now.  Uma Thurman in the same get up as Elle Driver wouldn't cut it; there aren't a handful of women, not discounting Hollywood actresses that could pull off what Darryl does here.  She is the best villainess we've seen, perhaps ever.  Never warmed by Uma, I am a fan of hers now.  She indeed shows us talent we never expected or frankly even demanded.  Usually the most wooden of actresses, she redeems all her career just speaking to us through the windshield of her car as the movie opens.  But she is never as riveting as her co-star; Ms. Hannah is a total showstopper in every frame in which she is visible, and that includes phone calls.  This by way of introducing THE FIGHT.  When Uma and Darryl have at it, as we hope they will, all girlfights ever recorded are left in Mohave trailer dust.  Even the superior opening fight of Vol. I pales in comparison to this frenetic kinetic combat.  We've never seen anything like this.  And so it goes for all of the film.  Interspersing humor, raw violence and quiet introspective minimalist dialog we get a stew of visual and aural greatness.  Of course this movie is all about style.  Why would you want or expect otherwise from a Tarantino flik?  None in the audience spoke, looked at their watch or even wiggled.  And what more can you say of the hypnotic powers of film?",9,1,2,21 May 2004
50 First Dates," Bad Start Tanks Effort
","There are some ridiculous scenes at the beginning of `50 First Dates' that for all intents and purposes tank any opportunity there might have been for us to love this movie.  Forever after we wince often for fear Adam Sandler will pull an over-the-top Jerry Lewis moment, disturbing our attempt to understand  or at least ponder - Drew Barrymore's problem.  And her problem, one of a permanent short term memory loss rendering her incapable of recalling her yesterdays, is pretty fascinating.   
	Lucy Whitmore's (Barrymore) father and brother have built a world for her that is as touching as it is odd  they preserve a particular day for her to relive every morning.  Since, like Guy Pearce in the phenomenal `Memento' of a few years back, she cannot create new memories and every day is a new day. Thus they go through tremendous effort to see that she is not made upset by essentially anything new in her life. 	Alas, this is not `Memento'.  Absolutely none of the gritty realism, sheer guts of the main character as he searches for truth, none of the mystery or in particular the drive on the part of the memory challenged person to compensate for their new-found handicap is ever presented.  Lucy just wafts along, borne on the breeze created by the fanning of the spectators in her life.	`50 First Dates' is a disappointment in that generally films not offered for wide release yet starring some really talented actors often have a chance to be very good.  So we suspected this might be a sleeper, perhaps in the vein of the very interesting 2002 Sandler effort `Punch Drunk Love'.  But no, Sander has reverted to form.Granted, he shows some real talent and even sensitivity in acting as a talented and caring young aquarist.  But when it comes to comedy Sandler has one dimension, and it is from the Jim Carey School of Goofiness.  So we get totally inappropriate outbursts, sort of juvenile and most definitely silly. Consider two particular examples of this in the film.  At the very beginning Henry (Sandler) concocts an enormously unbelievable tale designed to assist in brushing off a one-night stand.  Later in a restaurant he illustrates (in front of Lucy) the hammiest crying jag recorded by anyone in recent memory.      Drew Barrymore, on the other hand, is such a treat to watch.  She has a few energetically comic moments and plays her character very believably, given her opportunities.  But for the most part Sandler acts as a moth to her flame, which has the effect of diluting, not enhancing, her performance. Ms. Barrymore can equal the best work of any of the good young actors available today and can be admired for trying just about anything role. 
There are enough quality moments in `50 First Dates' to allow that it has some appeal.  But in no way is it of the caliber of `Memento', and it should be quickly forgotten. 	Rating: 2.5 Stars.",Null,0,2,28 June 2004
Finding Neverland," The Only Best Picture Contender That Is A Yawn
","Of the five nominated films for Best Picture this year, 'Finding Neverland' is in our view the weakest of the lot. And in fact we would argue it should not have been nominated at all. 'Kill Bill 2' or 'Hotel Rwanda' would have been better choices. But why might 'Finding Neverland' not meet our expectations?For one, this is a fairly boring tale. There is not one adult situation that hints of stress or personal conflict, or at least not in any normal human way. And we are beset with the New Age twist to how we should behave around kids; we hear an awful lot of 'quiet voices' and as is customary in tales embracing the adoration of all things child-like children are afforded the powers of observation and acumen of adults.Prior knowledge of the Peter Pan story is requisite. And while that tale has most undoubtedly been treated well in many of our lifetimes, the background of how J. M. Barrie came to render the original story is less than compelling, really. That Barrie subsumed himself in a child-like fantasy world is amusing, but no more than that. 'Finding Neverland' might be a far more interesting account of the principal's lives if it had been more true to real life and if we had been shown even a smidgen of chemistry between the real-life Sylvia Davies (Kate Winslet) and J. M. Barrie (Johnny Depp).Johnny Depp no doubt gives a seminar in acting, as he always does; he is one of our finest actors. In an interview (http://www.the-trades.com/column.php?columnid=2898) director Marc Forster describes Depp 'as a 'great creative collaborator'. 'The amazing thing is Johnny ultimately trusts the director,' Forster explains, 'and Johnny Depp trusting me is the highest compliment anyone could give me.'' Nonetheless Depp's carefully nuanced performance is no better than Kevin Kline's own in 'De-Lovely', and one could say they are even similar, with Kline getting the edge for the risks he takes and the passion he brings to the screen.Of the films nominated, these are the IMDb and Rotten Tomatoes ratings, respectively: Sideways (96%, 8.1/10), Million Dollar Baby (93%, 8.3/10), The Aviator (89%, 7.7/10), Finding Neverland (84%, 8.2/10) and Ray (82%, 7.9/10). In like manner, 'Kill Bill Vol. 2' checked in at 85%, 8.2/10 and 'Hotel Rwanda' garnered scores of 90% and 8.5/10. We leave it to you to make the final determination, but 'Finding Neverland' is exactly the type of film that will leave art film detractors delirious with delight; it is a yawn.Rating: Two and ¾ stars.",6,1,7,6 February 2005
Star Trek," Good Followup On The Original Premise
","Having never been a Trekkie, I approached the latest in the long line of films and television shows with no real love for the genre. I was hoping that at least the special effects might be good; they generally are nowadays. With a story of some interest and intriguing cinematography there's little wonder that is a box office hit.What we have for a plot is an almost bewildering blending of the past, the present and the future, all stitched together in a satisfying manner. But unlike the concurrently running 'Angels and Demons', this plot is actually believable, even though this is science fiction. The difference is the pacing and 'Stat Trek' has no trace of conspiracy; the enemy is well defined right from the beginning.What is definitely fun is that we meet the main characters of the film early on in their formative years; James Kirk, Spock, Scotty, Uhura, Sulu and even Dr. McCoy all reveal something of themselves. We now know a little more of how they came to be the crew of the Enterprise.The effects are quite remarkable, and any fan of space adventures will be satisfied with them. There is a plot point involving time travel that is the only blemish on the narrative; this seems to be like the use of magic in movies. Contrive a difficult situation and have characters saved by supernatural imposition. The artful dodge of movie making.This is probably the smartest of the summer blockbusters.Three stars.",7,2,10,25 May 2009
Coffee and Cigarettes," Seinfeld: The Movie
","`Coffee and Cigarettes' is an old tale, but until now only bits of this long-building fabrication have been available.  Begun in 1986 as a TV piece for Saturday Night Live, director Jim Jarmusch has stitched together a fabric of inter-related stories; remarkably coherent snippets as if Woody Allen has filmed Seinfeld episodes. 	Shot entirely in black and white, there could be no other way to get the gritty feel of most of the locations in color.  Since we intend to listen, the wardrobe doesn't particularly interest us, and what better way to envision a coffee shop than in B&W?  Thinking of it in reverse fashion, what would have been gained in filming in color?	'Ghost Dog; The Way Of The Samurai' has probably been the only movie that Jim Jarmusch has made that most might have heard of, but the current offering is more his trademark.  He certainly likes to use musicians as actors, for example; the cast of this film continues this tendency.  And certainly the use of black and white, as in Dead Man, seems an awfully comfortable medium for him as well. 	There are a total of eleven vignettes in the movie.  Each has its own title, and of course each has its own plot.  The best of the lot include Somewhere in California (starring Tom Waits and Iggy Pop), where these professed non-smokers sit in a booth and drink coffee, smoke and shoot the breeze.  The best idea in the entire film can be attributed to Steven Wright (Strange To Meet You) as he describes to Roberto Benigni why he likes to drink coffee before he goes to bed.	Perhaps watching Renée French (in Renée) reading magazines would be the hippest thing in the entire movie.  We need no explanation (and none is offered) why such a knockout would be casually thumbing through gun mags, but we love the notion that there might be a girl out there that does that.	The best faces in all the vignettes (No Problem) belong to Alex Descas and Isaach de Bankolé.  Their expressions are terrific as these friends wrestle with suspicion and disbelief, just as they might in real life.  Lastly, Steve Buscemi (Twins) apprises us of his suspicions about an unknown brother of Elvis and the real impact that purported surrogate had on myth surrounding the King.

Spider-Man 2," Spiderman II Will Beget III
","Sequels of successful movies (by definition box office receipts determine which films might be candidates) may or may not be up to the quality of the original work.  The same metric (ticket sales) determines, in the final analysis, whether subsequent releases might be in order. `Spiderman II' will certainly beget `III', but there are many of us that will not be in the theater the third time around.  	In the newest release we find that Spiderman has put aside his crime fighting compulsion to pursue a normal existence.  He has confronted real life and found his own progress  and he is a very young man, not an adult  unsatisfactory.  That is, unsatisfactory when measured against personal achievement (school and girls, primarily) and to a lesser extent the expectations of others.  Of course in true sub-adult behavior he has taken ownership of others problems as well, and unlike most of us is besieged by memories (his uncle, for example) of the sentimental persuasion.	But as always in the comic book kingdom there are forces at work beyond society's ability to deal with them.  A physicist (Doctor Octavius, played compellingly by Alfred Molina) has gotten completely out of control, and he himself does not know (nor do we) where the power of forces he has harnessed might lead.  It becomes necessary for our hero to come out of exile, as it were, and save The City (never been a superhero that saved an endangered species, parcel of BLM land or estuary). 	 	It might be helpful for a viewer to be a real comic book fan to appreciate this newest release.  The effects are, for all their hype, just okay.  More specifically, Spidey's flights through The City are cartoonish looking; certain aspects of Doctor Octavius' appearance are very nice, though.  But all in all comic book art is as real as that seen in the new CGI world. 
	What really enervates `Spiderman II', however, is the talking (mostly monologues) and extended action scenes.  In order to show us this more sensitive superhero we must suffer an awful lot of nonessential plot points (consider his aunt and her issues) and Kirsten Dunst's (playing Mary Jane) parallel search for happiness.  And by the way, the train sequence is WAY too long.   		Tobey Maguire (Peter Parker) certainly is one of the best choices ever made for the regular guy component of the Superhero/mortal man formula.  Thinking of The Hulk, Superman or Batman in film history we find there have been no more believable or likeable equivalents.  But Peter's humanness is exploited to the extent that future visits to this mine might yield very little in the way of additional sensitivity nuggets.    	Fans of a particular movie or movie genre are opinionated and, to their credit, informed, compelling us like them to find out for ourselves whether the sequel is equal or better.  In this case we should consider that the novelty of `Spiderman' has worn off, and we find in viewing `Spiderman II' that if some editing (approximately 30 minutes) had been done, the film would be far more likable.  And that Tobey Maguire is up to recreating his role in any number of sequels.  But this one is not better than the original.	Rating: Three Stars.",Null,0,0,4 July 2004
Finding Nemo," All About The Reef
","In `Finding Nemo' we have not only a movie designed for adults and children but a tour-de-force in computerized animation.  The obvious attention by the filmmakers to real environments is underscored by our constant study of the screen; there is, like on a real reef, frenetic activity in all of our view.	Following the adventures of a father fish (Marlin, voice of Albert Brooks) in pursuit of his kidnapped (by a diver to his aquarium) son (Nemo, voice of Alexander Gould) we meet a bevy of characters along the way.   In turn we have fish schools (both of an academic nature and the more easily imagined natural sea configuration), non-traditional sharks, turtles and a host of other ocean creatures anthropomorphically styled.  There is nearly no end to the pleasure received from each animated revelation.         The obvious care with which the undersea environment is depicted speaks volumes for the research done by the studio artists.  With nearly all contemporary eyes cast heavenwards, it still remains that the vitality of reef life forms serve as a perfect centerpiece for cartoon mayhem.      
	During one particular chase scene involving sharks we see at its best the dynamic plasticity of animated characters; that quality of animators to stretch the physical reality of any corporeal subject, i.e, the mashing of an impassively expressionless fishes' face as it strikes an object, encouraging empathetic discomfort on the part of the viewer.  This is abstraction at its finest, since it imbues the pratfall with fantasy. 		There is a scene involving Dory meeting a whale that is for our money the funniest one moment ever recorded in animated film.   Combined with the entire body of work Ellen Degeneres offers towards the success of `Nemo' we see her in an entirely new light.	That  `Nemo' is one of the best animated films ever made is in little doubt.  This is a true four-star effort; there is not one flaw evident.  Or to put it another way, what would you have done differently?",Null,0,1,3 June 2004
The Day After Tomorrow," So Serious
","The Day After Tomorrow is well worth the effort it might take to see it at the plex.  This is a film that recognizes the value of the big screen and is a treat to look at.  Not in the sense of cinematographic beauty but as a sensory wake-up call.  Unlike many action movies of recent years, I did not notice that the sound was so loud and insistent that it became annoying.  So the proper use of loud noise to underscore frightening moments was properly heightened.  Add to that the nice use of computer-enhanced graphics (except the wolves) and what we have is a perfectly fine summer adventure flik.  It is nice to see Jake Gyllenhaal and Dennis Quaid offered the opportunity to work a big-budget Hollywood extravaganza, and I hope they were well paid for it.  Both were up to the roles assigned.  It is too bad the character Quaid played (Dr. Hall) was so serious all the time.  This seems to be the requirement for important scientists in all of filmdom, so I don't hold him personally responsible.  Scientifically the premise of this film is one enormous stretch. Scientists to this day, like the Three Bears , cannot even agree on whether the Earth is cooling, warming or just right.  Type global warming and then type global cooling into a Search Engine; ponder the number of hits received on each.   In the adventure sense Day After Tomorrow is rather a larger fissure to jump, mountain to climb or river to swim.  The storyline regarding the trek undertaken by the distraught father (Quaid) to reach his son (Gyllenhaal) is peppered with unlikely issues.  In one case snowshoes are depended on to provide transportation and no Olympic athlete ever covered the distances cited in less than a hundredfold the time.  In any case the film is a fairly riveting action yarn with mild political overtones.  Even children can view it without fear of nightmares; they may laugh out loud at the stunts involving the aforementioned wolves, though, since they watch more cartoons than adults.",8,0,0,31 May 2004
Milk," Good Study Of A Maverick Character
","Sean Penn's interpretation of real-life politician Harvey Milk is spot on. His completely convincing role as a gay man, a politically active one at that, again shows the remarkable actor capable of seemingly anything. But there is a bit of a letdown, to me, about this new film. I say new because a documentary has already been about Milk (The Times of Harvey Milk, 1984), and that detracts a bit from the novelty of this work. And if you read a little about the earlier movie you will find that it was very good - 3 and a half stars from Roger Ebert alone (so you know it had to be at least pretty good!). If I would have known this story had already been covered, I would not have seen it. Remakes are almost always a bad idea. There are new ideas promulgated in Hollywood every week.This movie follows most closely Harvey Milk's years in San Francisco. He didn't arrive there until fairly late in life - he was 42. Within a short period of time he became totally immersed in city politics. His story is certainly unique in that he flaunted his gayness in a time when that was unheard of, and he tilted at seemingly every political windmill he saw. I leave it to you to follow his story, from local businessman - he bought a camera shop on Castro - to elected official, serving in City Hall. And we do see a bit of the personal side of Milk; he had a series of relationships over the years, and his last one was marked by tragedy.The movie does convey some of the energy of the times, and of Milk himself; late night sessions with his colleagues, making speeches on soapboxes, pressing City Hall on an unending stream of concerns. It is intriguing how the gay community grew in power in San Francisco, and Harvey Milk was part of that renaissance. It was at City Hall where he met his fate at the hands of fellow Supervisor Dan White - played well by Josh Brolin. Although I cannot see the reason for the Best Supporting Actor nomination Brolin received; his part is not particularly lengthy nor could it not have been done as well by another.This is a three star movie.",8,1,3,25 March 2009
Hotel Rwanda," Good On All Levels
","Don Cheadle has been operating just below the critical radar for many years. Known to many in supporting parts, his first starring role in a major film ('Hotel Rwanda') is incontrovertibly a tour de force. Much ado is made in the critical press of the likeness of 'Hotel' to 'Schindler's List'. Be that as it may this is a welcome addition to filmdom, a veritable eye-opener with a distinctive air.Filmed entirely in South Africa, director Terry George captures the feel of Kigali, a city in the center of a country in the center of Africa. Little of the veld, the jungle or desert is seen here; this is a country of hills savanna about the size of Maryland supporting nearly eight million people (http://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/rw.html); but that Rwanda lost upwards of one million in a widespread campaign of genocide in '94 clearly demonstrates the sheer horror of the 100 days between April and July that year.As events unfold, Paul Rusesabagina (Don Cheadle) is manager of a fine establishment (Hotel des Milles Collines) that is poised on the edge of an unbelievable maelstrom of events  the death of the President, calls for unconscionable murder of civilians of the wrong (Tutsi) alignment and civil war. Amid the escalating chaos and insanity of the situation stands a kind calm soul thrust into such responsibility as cannot be imagined.And imagination is the key. Throughout the story we find ourselves musing over the fact that we don't know such chaos; being pulled from your car to show your papers, seeming government endorsement of mass killing, neighbors ratting on neighbors, war within the city, displaced children, roving bands of thugs, the list of horrors goes on.Things never unfold that black and white decisions can be made in such madness. And so we can only imagine we would behave or react as does Paul- his solid and basic goodness is what saves him, his family and more than a thousand he touches while Rwanda implodes. As each new decision must be made  where to put some orphans, how to handle a desultory staff, how to continue the flow of supplies into the hotel, how to handle his family, how to react to demands of local political and law enforcement, we watch him spin, not on a downward but an upward spiral, rising above all those about him.Director George says that '...but I think what we set out to do is tell this modern day African hero story in a way that ordinary people will relate to him, and see that if they can tap into a moral courage, that they could possibly be Paul. He's not a superhero, he's not somebody outside the conceptualization of ordinary people. That was the primary objective, and also to show just the strength of his love story and the family unit, and then this thriller element of the whole story itself. And finally, the political quagmire and the intensity and enormity of the genocide itself. And I think on all those levels, we've done pretty good.' (http://movies.radiofree.com/interviews/hotelrwa_terry_george.shtml).Good indeed. After you've viewed this must-see film, view these sites to learn more: Radio Télévision Libre de Mille Collines (RTLM), which incited much of the trouble (http://www2.rnw.nl/rnw/en/features/media/dossiers/rwanda-h.html); a photo of Paul and his wife (http://www.filmstew.com/Content/Article.asp?ContentID=10480); and interview with Don Cheadle (http://www.cnn.com/2005/SHOWBIZ/Movies/01/06/don.cheadle/) the studio's site, which is quite a good source for background (http://www.mgm.com/ua/hotelrwanda/main.html) and a very nice interview with Don Cheadle and Paul Rusesabagina (http://filmforce.ign.com/articles/574/574554p3.html) that illustrates how some Hollywood touches were applied.

Ocean's Twelve," Nice Entertainment
","I am a bit exasperated and even a little disappointed at the mixed reviews for 'Ocean's Twelve'. The 60% score registered on RottenTomatoes' scale works as well as any to reflect the division within critics' ranks. Generally these are the films most worth viewing to determine how in the world such a large spread of opinion exists.Unless I am mistaken, the adult American moviegoer is a relatively well informed consumer. To that point, I cannot recall a single moment in any of the pre-release marketing blitz for 'Ocean's Twelve' that indicated we had Oscar-contending material, great emotive acting or social impact/political value here. And since this is essentially 'O.E. II' what major surprise might it be that what we have here is a great goof? Let's examine some facts.The plot: Terry Benedict (we are treated to another Andy Garcia portrayal), victimized Bellagio owner of the first movie, wants his money backwith interest. He leans, in succession, on all the original members of Danny Ocean's (George Clooney) eleven teammates. And of course the note is due in an impossible time frame. A lot of cash will need to be stolen, and fast. So the original 'O.E.' team needs to be reassembled to pull some more capers.What the team also finds out in short order is that not only are they being tailed by a resourceful (and strikingly  Katherine Zeta-Jones) international policeman but are also threatened by a master thief (Vincent Cassel as Francois) that wants to top them in every way. So our boys have to buck up and try and fend off all manner of adversity as they pursue their less than honorable  'does anyone have any moral issues about this?' is asked early on  goals.This is not a flick filled with Bond-like gadgets or even the usual heist-focused set ups. But there is just enough of that to whet the appetite. The elaborate set up in their first caper, beginning with a shot of a sailboat at anchor and then penetrating it's eerie appearance to see what is going on below gives just enough of a head scratching high-tech look (and isn't it all about 'the look'?) to satisfy.One-liners and quips are expected and by rights a necessity not overlooked in 'Ocean's Twelve'. And knowing glances. Lots of glances. Let's face it; this really is a hip collection of talented individuals. Most of us aren't, couldn't be and probably don't even know one. Well, here is a whole room full. I suspect most critics are jealous; always have. Listen to Elliot Gould's line when surprised at an interruption during his visit to a fortune teller. Watch K. Zeta-Jones turn in the only real emotional scene. It is actually quite touching. Having played the somewhat hard-bitten and driven law enforcement pro, she offers a bit of vulnerability for us to savor. See Brad Pitt grimace when he finds he's made a mistake.Check out two interviews (there are many available) to share the sheer fun these stars have and consider how lucky we are for their collaboration. See what George Clooney says (http://www.darkhorizons.com/news04/ocean1.php) about caper movies. Better yet, check out the ensemble interview at http://home.hamptonroads.com/stories/story.cfm?story=79148&ran=247675 in which we sense the fun this group had and continues to have.In all, we are offered what we expect  a smart caper film with some of the best in Hollywood delivering the goods. There is no political message here, no social axe ground nor remarkable signature or auteur offered; I trust you to relegate those criticisms for the art-house films and the annual launch of Oscar contenders as 2004 winds down. What we have here is a nice entertainment for the holiday season!Rating: 3-1/4 Stars.",8,6,15,14 December 2004
10 Things I Hate About You," Frame Your Mind to Mirth and Merriment¹
","`10 Things I Hate About You' begins as all teen movies should, with a tour around the high school, someone pointing out the various groups (i.e., stoners, geeks, athletes) for our amusement.  This may be the perfect set up; nearly everyone goes to high school and every school has cliques. Grounding us in the familiar is a fair way to prepare us, as high school didn't, for what is about to come.	Reconstituting the theme (and it could use a rewrite) developed by no less a teen story author than William Shakespeare in `Taming of the Shrew', we find that a father has two daughters of which the youngest cannot date until the elder one has done the same.  Since the older (Kat, played by Julia Stiles) is an asocial asexual head case, it seems unlikely any boys will get a shot at the far more desirable younger sister (Bianca, as portrayed by Larisa Oleynik).  And so the fun begins as a bevy of young men contrive to have school bad-boy legend Patrick (Heath Ledger) hook up with Kat.	As it plays out, no real surprises occur.  But the shenanigans and complications which arise as Pat woos Kat and Cameron (Joe Gordon) sets his sights on Bianca are more than pleasantly wrought.  In fact watching each rite of passage (house party, prom) is a treat, more than can be credited to most teen flicks.      	After a house party which both sisters attend, we see a dramatic thawing of Kat, but not such a change that she is willing to offer a good night kiss to Pat.  And so it goes that Pat, initially repulsed (strictly in it for the money) by Kat will move her; nonetheless, she does make it a hard road for him all along the way.	The film breaks down a bit when Pat croons to Kat at soccer practice and plumbs even lower depths when Kat springs Pat from detention.  But these are small departures from the overall dynamic.  Credit Director Gil Junger - this is his first feature film effort  with putting together a good script (not heavy on the Shakespeare, rapid fire comedic touches delivered with almost no letup) and the kind of actors that can carry off the pace and look good in the bargain.  Junger has been a fixture in television for years, having directed for no less than 17 series  as diverse a lot as `Dharma and Greg', `Nurses' and `The Jeff Foxworthy Show'.	As to the supporting cast, there really is no one to not like.  In particular Michael (played by veteran David Krumholtz) is great as kind of a sidekick-AV nerd to Joseph Gordon and just watching the former introduce Cameron around the new school as the movie begins is worth seeing.  And Michael delivers the set up to the best line in the movie in the lunch line (Pat's response is perfect).  	Since this is a comedy, and one that makes no bones about its intent, the acting is suitably droll, at times fleetingly clever but always a shade light.  But hearing Julia Stiles deliver the `10 Things' of the movie title is sufficient reward for those seeking some real acting.  In no other moment are the actors required to show anything of a serious nature.  But as has been mentioned, Shakespeare is the originator of the story, making one wonder:  Has there really been an onslaught of Shakespearian-themed movies more recently as critics suggest?	Let's look at some numbers.  Using only the key word Shakespeare in searching archival plot summaries, one comes up with the following:Rotten Tomatoes (# of Hits by Era) - 2000-04 (6) 90's (72) 80's (26) 70's (10) 60's (12) 50's (14)IMDB (# of Hits by Era) - 2000-04 (21) 90's (34) 80's (13) 70's (9) 60's (3) 50's (5)	However the plot summaries address (or don't address) Shakespearean themes, these searches suggest there are a lot more movies somehow tied to The Bard now than there were then, to put a loose term to it.Rating: Three Stars.	 ¹ - Taming of the Shrew - Induction  Line 135",Null,0,0,8 August 2004
The Aviator," American Originals
","It is hard to imagine there might be a film released in time for Oscar contention that will more perfectly fit the profile of a Best Picture candidate. In a time when Americans struggle to feel good about themselves and about what makes us distinctly who we are in the view of the world, we are offered 'The Aviator'.Howard Hughes (Leonardo DiCaprio) was a master juggler of interests; it is difficult to sort out whether passions, ingenuity, aggressiveness or private obsession drove him, and perhaps it was all those things. We have always viewed him from the later, more eccentric years, a recluse no longer able to deal with the world or even the smallest mote on a tie or milk bottle out of place. This is not fair, and director Martin Scorcese's decision to key on Hughes in his prime is brilliant.The studio Internet site (http://www.miramax.com/aviator/) is a nice one and I encourage you to visit it for background on some of Scorcese's vision. There is no doubt he attempted to bring realism and truth to the screen. For a thumbnail on Hughes check out Wikipedia's bio (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howard_Hughes) and if you doubt the severity or facts about his crash in Beverly Hills try http://www.check-six.com/Crash_Sites/XF-11_crash_site.htm for just how lucky and admittedly foolhardy Hughes was  throughout his life.Scorcese has assembled a fine, if not near perfect cast for 'The Aviator'. Grading out the roles of key figures; Gwen Stefani doesn't come close to capturing Jean Harlow's look and not much is required of her otherwise; so too Jude Law's inclusion as Errol Flynn is a cameo and he just may be there because he was available during a hot year for him; Kate Beckinsale is quite captivating as the captivating Ava Gardner and shows us a nice moment in the latter part of the movie; Alec Baldwin (portraying Pan Am visionary Juan Trippe) and Alan Alda (as Senator Brewster) nail their parts, and both should be applauded for adding real value to the final effort; John C. Reilly (whom we all love but only gets one opportunity to say something of importance) plays a fine sidekick (Noah Dietrich) and Kelli Garner is equal to the task of depicting Faith Domergue.But DiCaprio and Cate Blanchett really deliver the goods. In Leonardo's case we get the first opportunity of seeing him portray a real man. Flawed as Hughes may have been, he was an American original, the American dream, really, and we are never in doubt that we are really watching Howard Hughes. Leonardo will absolutely rivet you in his depiction of Hughes as he testifies (late in the film) before Senator Brewster's Committee; this is the best work DeCaprio has ever done.There has never been an actress, or any other woman, for that matter, that looked like Katherine Hepburn. Again Scorcese made the right decision, knowing full well Hepburn's look couldn't be duplicated, to use a terrific actress that convincingly delivers what Hepburn herself always delivered  a class act with signature singularity. No mean task, that, and Blanchett really adds the extra required.The only moments that did not ring true were fleeting, but the key unnecessary insertion was a childhood memory of Hughes revisited late in the film and is a little heavy handed; I immediately thought of 'Citizen Kane' and 'Rosebud' and did not appreciate the similarity. Secondarily, much ado is made of Hughes discovering the need for clouds to serve as a backdrop for air battles to emphasize speed, but William Wellman had actually discovered this (and is so credited in several books) a few years previously while filming the first Academy Award Best Picture ('Wings').Martin Scorcese's 'The Aviator' is so captivating that it is difficult to figure how any other film of '04 can possibly be a better candidate for Best Picture. We have, in fact, an American original (Scorcese) weaving a story about an equally compelling figure in our history. And it is all here: the stars, the acting, and the period feel, the cinematography and Leonardo DiCaprio doing his best work ever. This is one that will be watched again and again by the next generation. That is as good as Scorcese could have hoped for.Rating: Four Stars.",10,0,3,8 January 2005
Burn After Reading," The First of More To Come
","Hollywood's fall lineup has had as one of it's leadoff pictures 'Burn Without Reading'. Yes, film entertainment is just like the fashion industry, introducing the season's must-have (in the case of movies, must-see) items early on. Along with Spike Lee's 'Miracle at St. Anna' these are the best of September's offerings.The plot, as it were, primarily centers around the existence of a disk containing the writings of an ex-CIA agent (John Malkovich) and the attendant goings-on of nearly all the remaining cast. The departure here from the normal spy-chase cum thriller is that not any of the behaviour or antics of the characters matters one whit in the final analysis. But it does make for an amusing ride.George Clooney (cast as a Treasury agent, though that matters little) is the lover of Tilda Swinton, the wife of the aforementioned CIA agent. Brad Pitt and Frances McDormand are employees of a gym. How all these characters get involved with the disk and with each other I leave for you to enjoy.This is definitely a film that will satisfy all fans of Coen Brother's offerings.",8,1,4,10 October 2008
The Caine Mutiny," Some Angry Men
","'The Caine Mutiny' is one of those movies that is really noteworthy because - well, how many mutiny movies can you name? If you put mutiny as a plot keyword into IMDb, you get 110 hits. A great many of those are TV show episodes, and only a few of the movies are memorable.'Amistad', 'Mutiny on the Bounty', 'The Caine Mutiny', these are a few that come to the fore. And 'The Caine Mutiny' is in my view probably tied in quality with 'Mutiny on the Bounty' - the latter being the 1935 version with Clark Gable and Charles Laughton. I have not seen the critically acclaimed 'Amistad'.The cast of 'The Caine Mutiny' is really quite special. There is not a sour note in any of the performances we see. In particular Fred McMurray plays a turn as a bit of a rabble-rouser aboard the Caine. I think it is the best role he ever had. Van Johnson, as second in command, is equally well suited for his part, and it too may be his best work. Some think Bogart's interpretation of Queeg is extraordinary, but I think his role in 'The Treasure of the Sierra Madre' may be at least its equal.Seeds of doubt regarding the Captain (Humphrey Bogart) are sown early on. The crew of the Caine watches him perform some questionable actions, but I will leave it to you to determine if Captain Queeg is at any point unfit for duty. What some would call the crucial scene is directed superbly, with some character's lack of action as important as those in action.Nearly all of the elements of a great movie are here. The soundtrack is not very interesting but I don't think anyone cares in this case. And the look of the movie is right, in every regard - shipboard, the courtroom, the bit of San Francisco we see while the Caine is in port there. There is even a romance as a plot thread.The court martial, held of course towards the latter part of 'The Caine Mutiny' (1954), is in its own right worth seeing. Jose Ferrer and E.G. Marshall as lawyers are worthy adversaries. It rivals in its effect the somewhat contemporary Henry Fonda classic, 'Twelve Angry Men' (1957). The outcome of the trial presents we the viewers with some lingering questions, and rightly so. Mutiny is no small matter in the military, and discipline is certainly one of the cornerstones of an effective fighting force.This is a four star picture.",9,1,4,24 March 2009
The Village," 'The Island' Meets Scooby-Doo Meets Stephen King
","As atmospheric thrillers go, M. Night Shyamalan's 'TheVillage' is decidedly of the ho-hum variety. In fact, it actually is one of the more annoying films  among those that have a certain pedigree, some hint of promise  of 2004.Set in 1897 Pennsylvania, we are transported to a time and place of such improbable existence that we are forthwith un-amused by the setting. We learn that the community is isolated to a degree particularly unfathomable as close to the turn of the century as is depicted. The East had been long crisscrossed with roads and commerce; no community in Pennsylvania (perhaps in other parts of Appalachia this may have been the case) was so remote. But for the sake of the film, let's consider that they are that isolated.What comes to pass is that the town-folk have established a sort of truce with the horrifically-depicted denizens of the surrounding forest. A veritable wall has been built to demarcate the limits of the community; anything outside the line is certainly out-of-bounds. And the Elders have certainly taken great pains to point out that, basically, this is our turf and that is theirs, and as long as we respect that we are alright.And right here we have to say the most engaging character of the entire film is William Hurt (as Edward Walker, it seems the Senior Elder). He really does capture a soft-spoken self, offers some calm in the storm that the village confronts and seems the only logical one through all the film. What message might be gleaned is channeled through Hurt and Bryce Dallas Howard (Ivy Walker).The movie really is about those inside confronting the outside world. A swirl of events necessitates this. Rated an incredibly generous 6.5/10 on IMDb and a more appropriate 44% on the Tomatometer, M. Night Shyamalan himself notes in an interview (http://www.cinemaconfidential.com/news.php?id=0407301) that 'I wanted to write a romance, a period romance. I wanted to go back to the1890s where people believed in love. It was hard to write because I had to remove all my sarcasm out of my writing. Today when we say things sarcasm is always there. In that era, when someone said, 'I like you' it meant they liked you.' And therein lies the problem with 'The Village'  the writer has fallen for the always popular but wrong-headed notion that things were better in the old days. Hokum.But you would have to watch it for yourself to determine if any of this is plausible; this is not really a film that had to be made. 'The Village' is sort of Benchley's 1980 'The Island' meets Scooby-Doo meets Stephen King. And if any of that attracts your attention, this is the film for you.Rating: Two Stars.",5,0,1,31 January 2005
Cold Mountain," Nice Acting
","This movie, suffering a just a little from the semi-believability of the plot (a tale set in modern times and loosely based on real events; the real and somewhat less than heroic desertion a centerpiece for rumination), is nonetheless engaging and so well cast, acted and filmed it deserves a viewing.  The fans of 'Dances With Wolves' will be delighted as well as those enamored of the Odysseyan journey-film, sure always to be populated with oddball characters, punctuated with humorous moments and almost always senseless violence.   'Dead Man' seems to be the only film of the recent past with the feel of 'Cold Mountain', though the earlier film had more bizarre events than are recorded in the latter.  But here we must note the attractiveness of the cast in 'Cold Mountain'.  Renee would look great in a burlap sack, and Jude Law and Nicole are of the same ilk. The battle scenes are all quite good, although it is a bit of a stretch to think Inman would find his documents so readily after so horrendous an explosion.  And for the life of me I cannot determine how the 'turkey shoot' devolved into a hand-to-hand combat situation within a few frames of film. Inman's journey (oddly from inland to coast to inland) expressly exploits the 'Dead Man' aspect (or more recently 'Oh Brother..') view of travels cross country.  Note the completely rural setting of all the scenes; even in the U.S. of the 1860's it would be difficult to steer such a course.  Not on any occasion is a large town sighted. There is more than enough good writing to offer us some laughs, but for certain Ms. Zellwegger steals the show.  Her portrayal of a country girl of resource and unbounded energy (I don't offhand remember anyone filmed walking so bouncily)is such a pleasure to watch almost anyone in the camera with her seems to be in a support role.",8,1,1,28 December 2003
"I, Robot"," What 'Paycheck' Wasn't and What 'A.I.' Wanted To Be
","`I, Robot' is and should be a summer hit, but that tag is summarily unfair, in that it suggests a brainless action yarn designed to entertain us and while away a few torpid Dog Day hours.  This is hardly that; years in the making, `I, Robot' is all that the recent `Paycheck' never was and some of what `A.I' tried to be.    	Alex Proyas' 1998 film `Dark City' is such a murky, disturbing and complex sci-fi mystery we expect more of the same in `I, Robot', but instead are treated to a far lighter view of things futuristic.  Set in Chicago in 2035, as murkily sinister as `Dark City' is in its entirety so `I, Robot' reflects a far brighter and optimistic view of the future.  Though not a feel-good movie, we still might have a view less techno-phobic than  we might expect. 
	 Del Spooner (Will Smith) is a police detective still reeling from and dealing with post-divorce stress syndrome.  But we also detect immediately that several factors make Spooner tick and Proyas' weaving of these facets throughout the movie is masterfully done.  Things inexplicable (dreams, opinions and attitudes, subtle and not-so-subtle actions) eventually tie together, allowing us more character development of Spooner than we at first might think has occurred.  This is subtlety meant to raise this from the action flick the trailers suggested to what is in reality a fine work.  
	Will Smith and Bridget Moynahan are certainly a handsome couple, with she being as cool a customer as he is focused yet affable.  They strike an interesting dynamic, one which is not chemical yet also reveals little repellence for each other's company.  Sort of an asexual symmetry that neither makes us curious about where they might be in five years or whether they will ever even have a drink together.	The splicing of Dr. Lanning's theoretical discussions into the narrative is very influential in developing an understanding of robotic evolution.  These are the cerebral parts of the film, where we most feel Asimov's influence and it almost as if the writers have reached for and found a selection from one of his works.   	Much of the look of `I, Robot' hinges on the success of CGI effects and with a few exceptions this is as good as we've seen.  What worked: Sonny the Robot, long shots of Chicago, heights and robots moving about in real life. What didn't work as well were action scenes; car chases, mid-air hijinks or anything to do with an explosion.  The digital downfall is often apparent; most rapid action sequences still appear to have that shards-of-glass-shimmery-pixel-puzzle-thing going on, annoyingly unlike any view our eye may have of real events. Taking the instance of the exploding house sequence, almost no part of that scene seems plausible.    	One appreciates there is, and should be, some hype involved in the promotion of a movie.  Nonetheless a talking head read a line the other day in which `I, Robot' was attributed to a book by `cult author' Isaac Asimov. Of all the science fiction writers in the world, Asimov is about as famous as they come.  Perhaps the drivel on television might better be entrusted to robots; Sonny said more intelligent things than that.	Rating: Three and a half stars.",Null,0,0,24 July 2004
The Alamo," Pitched Battle
","The myth, sense of adventure and inherent good vs. evil battle we know today as `The Alamo' has always demanded better treatment by Hollywood. And this film comes as close to depicting the way the siege probably played out far more fairly than we have seen.  In that sense this revisit to `The Alamo' is a very welcome addition to the list of movies on the subject.
	The casting alone demands some attention.  Billy Bob Thornton gives a nice portrayal of the figure we now think Davy Crockett probably was; a man thrust into a pretty sticky situation but due to his own responsibility as a leader plays it out as best he can.  Bowie (Jason Patric) adds an element of pathos far superior to any ever portrayed, while Travis (Patrick Wilson) and Sam Houston (Dennis Quaid) are far more human  and in Houston's case more brilliant  than we might have considered.	For some reason battle films require sentimental touches, and this version of `The Alamo' is no exception.  Nonetheless there would have to be, in a siege of eight days, some time for reflection by participants on both sides. And to the credit of the writers enough humor is injected into the script to balance somewhat this aspect  how to film men waiting - of the 1836 engagement.	 Essentially critically dismissed or ignored, `The Alamo' will prove to be one of the very good but highly underrated movies of the year.  `The Alamo' delivers in a few minutes a more remarkable feel for what the actual few minutes of pitched battle probably looked and sounded like than we have ever seen.  There is a shot from afar, in the early morning light, which dramatically captures the moment the assailants took the mission.  And the sensory quality of that few minutes of hellish pandemonium is equal to any seen in a war film, contemporary or not.        As one does when entering this shrine in San Antonio, our hat is off to the fine effort put forth here.  Humanizing what was most assuredly an inhumane series of events - the fight for a free Texas - has never been done so well.Rating: Three Stars",Null,1,1,25 June 2004
Monsters vs. Aliens," Buck Turgidson Returns
","'Monsters vs. Aliens' is a bit of let down; we have become spoiled by the animators now putting together what has been a string of fine offerings in the past decade. This movie, like many, seems to have two parts; a vigorous first part and a more lethargic ending portion.It starts off by showing us a bride-to-be having her wedding ceremony interrupted by the fall of a meteor whilst she is outside the church. The result of the exposure – she becomes a giant, and you can't help recalling 'Attack of the Fifty Foot Woman'. She is forthwith whisked off to a secret government prison for other monsters. Some of the incarcerated monsters – and none of them have similar problems – have been there for many years.An alien probe lands on Earth, and no solution can be found to deter them from destroying our planet. Finally an (overacting) general offers that the monsters in the prison should be used to thwart the invasion. This general character is too much remindful of George C. Scott in his role as Buck Turgidson in 'Dr. Strangelove'.After initial attempts to repel the aliens fail, we follow the efforts of the monsters to put an end to the invasion. This is the second portion of the film and is not nearly as engaging as the first part.Despite the rather saccharine lessons we are made to endure – why are we constantly lecturing to kids? – the overall animation makes this one worth watching.Three Stars.",8,0,1,17 April 2009
Collateral," Darkness Reveals
","With an opening momentarily becalming yet hypo-energetically transmitting chemical interaction between as unlikely a pair as could be imagined; cab driver and lady lawyer, we are hooked.  We have seen Tom Cruise in a fleeting exchange of packages but we want to know more about this pair.  Instead we are brilliantly led through an admittedly stretchy sequence of overtly criminal acts misdirecting our attention entirely from the hookup that eventually puts a human face on events crazier than we might ever conceive.  	 Jada Pinkett Smith (playing lawyer Annie) and Jamie Foxx (as cabdriver Max) are the pair we want to follow.  But Tom Cruise (Vincent) so persuasively moves Max (throwing cash around) to cooperate in his evening's agenda we are compelled to watch what might happen; the why becomes less interesting as the how propels us.  This is an actioner for the more discriminating viewer.    		Director Michael Mann has shown us brilliance; his ability to draw great work from gifted actors was displayed in the very memorable `Heat'.  DeNiro and Pacino show us more acting in one exchange across a restaurant table than we might find in 10 movies.  Mann does it again, lending that signature spoken about previously: his view about `a movie's genetic coding': a swirling double helix of image and sound, character and story, fantasy and fact.' (http://www.salon.com/bc/1999/02/02bc2.html)  	Tom Cruise will never fail to impress us with his athletic ability and flat out complete mastery of any and all he is asked to do onscreen.  Witness the absolute talent involved in his gun handling (watch that magazine change mid-movie), his marvelous twist (an exceedingly nimble foot-twist) as he crashes through a pane of glass or just watch him run.   There is no one as compactly and fervently packaged.	But on no account can the work of Mark Ruffalo (a seriously focused detective) or Jamie Foxx be minimized; they ground the environment Cruise operates in, giving us plausible moral rightists attempting to set things right.  But Tom trumps all when he tells us `I'm paid to do this' toward the end of the film; a line intoned to accommodate a nihilistic view (auteur).	In a season of film completely devoid of the darkness and truth that makes us re-evaluate life as a series of violent and semi-violent acts, we have `Collateral'.  Savor the small things presented: the streets of LA shot from above, that no one can film club scenes like Hollywood can  small wonder the world envies us; we shoot better, more deliberately, than ever another nation would convey; no apology in the mayhem.  Watch it twice, there is no film release of the past few months equal save `I, Robot'.

Dark City," The Look
","One of the best movies of the year, 'Dark City' has one quality that totally mesmerizes the viewer  the look. There are few films in recent memory so completely watchable in the sense that the pieces of the puzzle are fleetingly offered, rapid fire and at first inexplicable. We find John Murdoch (marvelously underplayed by Rufus Sewell) awakening in a strange setting where he finds he is in an even stranger situation. Right from the outset we do not know exactly what is going on, but we will have our curiosity satisfied as to what each element of his environment means within short order.Murdoch is apparently wanted for murder(s), and we soon find Inspector Bumstead (William Hurt, who appears mysterious in his own right), Emma Murdoch  or is she really Rufus Sewell's wife? - (Jennifer Connelly) and Dr. Schreber (Kiefer Sutherland) entwined in Murdoch's life. Each actor develops their own character to fit the requirements of this nourish sci-fi treat.In particular Connelly and Sutherland are mesmerizing. Several actors could have played Sewell's part, but the aforementioned two give a special twist to their portrayals. In true noir fashion the motives of all are suspect.There is no movie that lays out the explanation for such a bizarre set of sensory details as 'Dark City'. We are so cleverly led through a minefield of clues that as the explanations for all these seemingly disassociated elements come into focus we are thrilled and by degrees satisfyingly enlightened. 'Dark City' is a must-see for fans of intellectually challenging science fiction thrillers. This will also be a fascinating find for those interested in well-plotted noir, even if they are not a sci fi fan.",Null,0,1,5 June 2004
Tropic Thunder," Tropic Torpor
","'Tropic Thunder' was, unfortunately, a small disappointment. The recent hype, critical reviews and even the original trailers had in my mind made this a sure-fire hit.Well, it probably does warrant hit status, content notwithstanding. Truthfully in the laugh meter department there aren't more then three or four outright funny moments. In truth, some grins and chuckles are found here and there (I noticed the audience reaction was very subdued), but not enough to elevate this to the next level - a six is the highest grade it can be awarded. It is disappointing that the premise and mix of action and satire didn't make for a better score.",6,3,7,7 September 2008
Alien vs. Predator," Mood Indiglo
","Every once in a while we tumble to the notion that a hot new movie, usually of the action genre, might be entertaining. And invariably something like 'Alien Vs. Predator' is the subject, making us wish we had washed the car, returned a few calls or read a magazine.Certainly fans of the original 'Alien' and even more so 'Predator' hold hope there might be even better yet to come. That has not been the case, and the experience of viewing AVP will not impel anyone to check on subsequent releases, the ending notwithstanding.The movie opens well, hooking us early with a few techno-moves, some potentially interesting characters and even a touch of curiosity about where this might lead. But within ten minutes, maybe fifteen minutes (no watch to check, but more about that later) we are hopelessly mired in the darkest, murkiest series of flashes and noises since 'Hellboy'. The best effects are actually shown early in the film. After the expedition has begun the adventure we see a flyover by the alien ship, a great bolt of energy discharged from space (with a purpose we discover within a few minutes) and a nice twist in a mountain-climbing scene. The flash and crash of the remaining hour or so is a patent bore.An interview with director Paul W. S. Anderson about this latest film reveals the following unintelligible exchange:Question: The first Alien was really horror oriented and the subsequent ones were more in the action/adventure area. What are you trying to do with this one? Paul: It's really a combination and it's not because of ALIEN, it's because of PREDATOR, which is more action-oriented. This movie has a slow build, which is more akin to ALIEN, but then the last 45 minutes is a pretty relentless action ride which has much more to do with ALIENS or PREDATOR.Sanaa Lathan as guide Alexa Woods is the most watchable of the cast, although veteran Lance Henriksen as expedition financier is a steady (not over the top at all: how he expresses his appreciation to the exploration team is nicely phrased). Lathan, at 33 and with a number of films behind her (the recent Denzel Washington actioner 'Out Of Time' (2003), in the successful 'Brown Sugar' (2002), a small role in the very popular 'Love and Basketball' in 2000) certainly deserved the lead. There are a number of questionable moments to amuse us and solidify AVP as a potential MST3000 candidate. We may note Ms. Lathan standing in mall-cruising grade clothing in the Antarctic, the use of flares as light sources (Why not candles or oil-soaked torches? Because they don't pop and frighten anyone.) and the simple fact there is never a good scare in the entire film. A 14% rating on the Tomatometer, by the way, gives us some appreciation for the overall quality of AVP.More than ever we regretted the recent loss of our big ticket high-tech Timex Indiglo watch. The glow would not have been noticed; cell phones and pagers were checked frequently by the backup Space Shuttle pilots, on-call neurosurgeons and Fortune 500 CEOs that populated the audience.Rating: 2 Stars.",Null,0,0,16 August 2004
Before Sunset," Film As A One-Act Play
","What happens when the opportunity to follow up on a brief romantic encounter years later presents itself? Ethan Hawke and Jule Delphy show us how it might go in 'Before Sunset', and viewing their exploration of the emotional minefield that most of us seem to have picked through in our own lives we reap large rewards. Along the way we are able to see one of the finest pair of performances in recent memory.Delphy (Celine) and Hawke (Jesse) meet in Paris when he is on a book promotion stop at a bookstore. They had met for one wild and fleeting evening years before; while they had vowed to meet again, it never happened and thus they wove their separate paths. Celine's appearance at the bookstore is so moving for Jesse (he spies her in a crowd as he speaks about the book) that he confronts her as soon as the opportunity arises when the interview is concluded.What then ensues is the cat-and-mouse back-and-forth alternately teasing and serious game of catch-up and reacquainting. Long shots of the pair in semi-serious conversation are quite phenomenal. Maintaining lengthy animated and effortless (uncontrived) dialogs in long continuous takes demands incredible talent. Both actors carry the ball so well it is noticeable there is never a false moment. Save at the end. Celine's unfortunate song is a little more than we can take; it seems like the placement of a second cherry atop a sundae, ergo more than is required and too sweet for our palate.You can either think of 'Before Sunset' as a one-act play or a perhaps even as a pair of interwoven monologues. Either will do, as the art here is really the incredible acting and chemistry of the players.In an interview with director Richard Linklater (he of 'Tape'  another play-like film, 'Slacker' and 'Waking Life') we hear him note that 'Before Sunset' is 'My own cinema dreams of my characters' lives still intertwining with each other.' (http://www.filmcritic.com/misc/emporium.nsf). And intertwine they do, capturing an exciting snapshot of a couple dancing moth-like around their mutually generated flames.This is no action flit, and we are spared any real surprises. And there are only a few memorable lines by either character; this is love-exploration, mild dabbling in those areas left to lovers and those with life scars they slowly choose to expose. But this movie is testament to how that early encounter nine years before had shaped their lives and in the story's circularity we are satisfied in the end how things might now go.Rating: Three and a quarter stars.",Null,0,1,26 December 2004
City of God," One For The Millennium
","'City of God' should and will be at the top of any list of movies for film courses from the New Millennium for many years to come. In terms of thematic development, political commentary, social importance, technical mastery and sheer energy it really has no equal since 2000. This is truly a mesmerizing piece, in which the events of many years are compressed into a few hours; like the early scene of the boy spinning about in a grievously perilous tight spot, we are left whirling when we exit the theater.We probably are first captured by the daring of the film. No slow starter, we are almost immediately plunged into a world of not just Rio's more disadvantaged side, but the loosely organized machinations of the most audaciously aggressive slum gangs we have ever seen. That these loose associations of crime lord fiefdoms are populated with youngsters is a revelation; nothing like it has been seen on screen. Consistent with the passions (misguided as they often are) of youth the frenetic pacing is so alluring it remains a complete mystery why the general film-going audience of the U.S, always whining for action (read violent) films, did not choke theaters in huge numbers. Want an action film with hip stars and great music? Well, here it is! Camera positioning  as in the shots of a man in flight, running through the streets and houses, seen from above, now around a corner, is so adroitly accomplished it is a wonder even non-film students don't rise and cheer at the mastery. An evolutionary montage of events taking place in a drug dealer's apartment have no equal in film as an example of compressing time and yet clearly allowing us to follow the sequence of events. The injuring (shooting) of young children in the course of the film is so unsettling even hard-core violence-in-film seekers will wince. The realism of this scene and others promote the documentary feel we have seen in some recent ('Traffic', opening of 'Amores Perros') films. All of these moments are documented from the POV of Rocket, the only one of the three boys we follow through the years that do not go the way of the gun but has found instead a camera to capture images. The in-your-face consideration of violent situations (and there a lot of them) is quite palpable. This is grit-your-teeth stuff, designed to repel, not attract us. Co-director Fernando Meirelles notes in an interview (www.slantmagazine.com/film/features/fernandomeirelles.asp) that 'When you watch my film, you don't want to be part of these gangs.' And it comes across that way, unlike the much more deified image 'Scarface' Al Pacino posters illustrate to this day.Originally scripted from a successful book by Paulo Lins, he is cited on the official web site by way of explaining his reasons for launching the project: 'I am very happy that my book Cidade de Deus is reaching more and more people through this film.This will enable us to increase the debate on violence, misery, abandonment and education in Brazil.'

Hellboy," Unlovable Cartoonish Figure
","Opening on the Isle of Skye off the coast of Scotland in 1944, we observe along with GIs crouched behind a wall the machinations of a bizarrely evil Nazi force as they attempt to open a portal to the dark side. In the aftermath of a vicious firefight a small creature is found (Hellboy), the only testament to the success of the aborted experiment.We flash forward in time and find this same grown (to some type of adulthood) being living in a techno-junkyard apartment of sorts. There he whiles away the hours waiting for calls to attend to evildoers as is the proper role of all superheroes. From this point forward he is summoned to dispatch, throughout the entire course of the film, all manner of threats to mankind.The cartoonish Hellboy (he is cut exactly from the Hulk creature mold) is a cigar-chomping and patently ugly fellow, but nonetheless is smitten with a never-can-have beautiful girl (Liz, voice of Selma Blair) and follows the direction of Professor Bruttenholm (voice of John Hurt) in what seems to be a pretty miserable existence.As with all superheroes, one marvels at the resilience of wise-cracking Hellboy (voice of Ron Perlman); suffering an untold number of ostensibly lethal blows, he is never slowed by any of them but later dresses superficial lacerations with great care, perhaps to show us a touch of humanity.As diversion Hellboy holds up pretty well, primarily because the visual computer-enhanced visions (fairly murky much of the time, to give us a sense of gloom and doom) are first-rate. But if there is a message here it escapes us, and like the Hulk film storyline we are left in the final analysis with an unlovable being and we have no interest in whether he finds happiness or not.",Null,0,0,2 June 2004
The Incredibles," The Technology Has EVERYTHING To Do With It
","In an age where well-crafted animated full-length films become available at the rate of two to three per year, we find again, in 'The Incredibles', one ostensibly for the ages. Critically acclaimed by nearly all (96% on the Tomatometer), again we pay tribute to the graphic artists and computer marvels generating inarguably clever entertainment. But is this more than a diversion? In other words, are we rating such animated features as 'The Incredibles' a little higher than they might actually merit?We are a becoming a little less charmed with the onslaught, if you will, of cartoons. This author would like to be as hip as the next, but grading animated features as highly as live action releases might be a slight to the latter, more traditional, forms of film. Recent documentaries ('Fahrenheit 9/11', 'Super Size Me') and mainstream efforts ('Ray', 'The Motorcycle Diaries') are rated similarly (ballpark estimates); can we in fairness agree that an animated adventure might be in the same class? But let us approximate the value here.The plot involves superheroes (Mr. Incredible, Elastigirl, others) having to go underground, having been found by society to offer more peril to a litigious society than we might have conjured, and this is pretty funny fare. Languishing in retirement, Mr. Incredible and superhero-friend Frozone are bored; Mr. Incredible takes action and returns to the exciting life of villain-thwarting he has missed so desperately for fifteen years. Eventually his wife (the afore-mentioned Elastigirl) and their children are drawn into Mr. Incredible's new life. And we are left with a bit of a warm feeling for how the family pulls together at the end after several adventures allow them to utilize their special skills. When questioned in a recent interview (http://www.cinecon.com/news.php?id=0411011) director Brad Bird (he of 'Simpsons' fame) makes an interesting comment:Q: Is it more difficult or easy to direct an animated feature compared to a live-action one?'I felt that the most important things to a film, no matter what the medium is - whether it's animation or real, are the same elements. It's still about characters that you care about and a plot that involves you emotionally, that is surprising but seems logical when you go back and think about what happened. I think that that is the stuff that dictates whether a film succeeds or fails. The technology has very little to do with it.'Since Bird has had virtually no hand in anything but animated TV and film, this is a less compelling statement than it might be otherwise. So, let's put animation where it belongs, as even the Academy of Motion Pictures places it: a separate category.Rating: Three Stars.",Null,0,0,21 November 2004
La Grande Illusion," Context
","It goes without saying that a film that dares make a social comment can only be appreciated when the time and/or place is understood.  'Grand Illusion' is of that genre, a film completely woven around the themes of the old vs. the new order and questions about a soldier's role. Set primarily in prison camps, the movie explores the world of prisoners (varied in social status, background and even ethnicity) hell bent on escape.  But more than that, it is a study of '...human characters who were not stereotypes.' (1)  Later pictures revolving around prison settings most assuredly are cast with an eye towards assuring us that each type will be represented, and in fact often become the butt of jokes because of it.  Not so in director Renoir's case. There are some very memorable and sometimes startling moments.  The orthopedic device Von Stroheim (as the camp director) sports is very striking as is his scene (and behavior) in the bar at the very beginning of the film.  There are some surprises regarding the use of languages, and the scenes involving the camp play are as timeless as a MASH rerun.   There are almost no technical flaws and the acting is superb, if not a bit over the top in the case of Rosenthal (played by Dalio).  A scene involving a shooting towards the end of the movie is a stretch when a sub-2 inch automatic is employed, but that is the only (and is a pretty famous) gaffe of note. The movie has been described as occurring in three movements (acquiescence, rebellion and return) (2) and this is a fair notation.  The art is how the director seamlessly moves us through this war adventure placed not on the battlefield, but primarily on the set.     (1) Bertin, Celia. 1991. Jean Renoir: A Life In Pictures.

Million Dollar Baby," Pugilistic Poetry
","The more I think about it, the more I am convinced this is the Best Picture of 2004, and it may be better than any since 'L.A. Confidential'. What we have here is a topical rumination on how people generally try and do the best they can, that things still often go askew and how we cope. This is Clint's spin on reducing all to Hemingway's view that the greatest impediments in conducting life are fear and sentimentality.The story is a simple one, it seems. Trainer Frankie Dunn (Clint Eastwood) and ex-fighter Eddie 'Scrap Iron' Dupree (Morgan Freeman) have their less-than-idyllic but tolerably comfortable gym existence invaded by the likes of an aggressively and intensively focused female boxer. Talk about turning lives upside down! The entire scope of the known pugilistic universe is imperiled, and so are the lives of all those that touch newcomer Maggie Fitzgerald's (Hilary Swank) own.It is a truth that the promotion of this movie has been clever. Packaged as a girl-boxer flick, this is an enormous deception. In all fight films that have preceded this one  and there have been some very very good ones  not one will have left you, in a word, captivated. This is the only poetry I ever saw with gloves on.Clint Eastwood has graced us with  and I am not sure whether he is to be congratulated, or his questioner, or Film Comment  as cogent and compelling an interview as has been seen in that fine magazine in a long time. I refer you to http://www.filmlinc.com/fcm/1-2-2005/ceint.htm for Eastwood's views, but how about this for erudition while speaking volumes to the intelligence of us viewers: 'There is a tendency to treat the audience as if they won't stay with you unless you explain every little thing along the way.' And this speaks to the niceties of Eastwood's efforts in his later years. Look for the small things, a gesture, an aside  Morgan Freeman mutters some niceties, the lighting and especially the music.I cannot in good faith recall a movie that moved me as much as 'Million Dollar Baby'. Not ever. Maybe it is my academic research in subjects of this ilk, perhaps my 52-year old maleness, or that I have one child  a major-babe remarkably-gifted go-getting daughter, or that I had I've had my own questions about what greatness entails and what a successful life might be, or how I've dealt with just about any and all of the human issues Mr. Eastwood touches on in this remarkable film. And it must be said that the knockout blow delivered by 'Million Dollar Baby'  a message or perhaps reflection on topics that speak to our most private fears  is truly the stuff of a Best Picture.Rating: Four Stars.",Null,2,4,3 February 2005
Shrek 2," Animated Musical
","Shrek II is as good a sequel as we have seen in quite some time. Since the animation bar was raised just a few years ago with the release of Shrek and Monsters, Inc. and Toy Story it is no surprise that this latest addition is welcome entertainment.	Following the adventures of the cast introduced in Shrek, such adult concepts as true love, romance, acceptance and redemption as they travel to Fiona's parents kingdom-world.  It is therefore fairly engaging for adults and there is enough raw action to keep children in their seats.
	My only concern is the reliance on comedy to employ flatulence and burping as standard gags.  No one knows anyone that takes a small sip of wine and burps loudly at the dinner table, and I have always found this type of device the vilest attempt to ground a fantasy in some sort of reality.  But this does not detract from the overall high quality of the total effect.	There is a scene well into the movie that may be the funniest recorded in any animated film ever.  Simply stated, a series of events occur involving the law in the Kingdom and the principal characters, and in this moment Antonio Banderas' Puss In Boots character is the highlight.	The score of the movie is very good, and at times I wondered if having a soundtrack of the film would be something worth hearing later.  I cannot recall an animated movie in which the musical choices were so good.",Null,0,0,21 May 2004
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Chix In Flix
","'Kill Bill' is one of the truly hottest movies made in recent memory. There certainly was some hype associated with its debut; we knew, for example, it was to be made in two parts, but had no clue why that might be a good idea. Well, that as well as the structure and tone of the film were ALL good ideas.What we immediately conclude is that finest of accolades: there is no movie like this. Or, put another way, find me a film in which there are great chick fights (an opening number, as it turns out), mean blonde bad girls with eye patches, half a dozen edgy moments in which we might want to look away but instead grit our teeth and WATCH - voyeuristic as it may seem or listen to a score masterfully matched to the action.This is the revenge film of revenge films. The Bride (Uma Thurman) has been seriously wronged (by Bill  David Carridine  in the best work we have ever seen him do) and is out to make it right. Well, have revenge, anyway, the rightness of her actions questionable but probably what we would like to do ourselves given her situation.We also have recorded here some of the strongest female characters ever shown on film. In fact, nearly all the women are stronger than any man portrayed, and this is fascinating. Without doubt men troubled by tough women won't like much of what they see here. But those men that don't will be treated to some nifty niceties.Witness, as Uma Thurman runs through her list of former associates that she's determined must be eliminated, the first great femme á femme fight ever recorded; then watch assassin Lucy Liu (as O-Ren Ishii) deliver a stunning boardroom speech. There are no moments less riveting as The Bride moves though her list.For sheer style there have not been very many films offered us that convey such tongue-in-cheek mayhem. Put this one on your list of must-sees. Rating: Four Stars.",Null,0,1,20 October 2004
Big Fish," Exaggerated, But How Could It Not Be?
","In the movie 'Big Fish' we are asked to follow the life of a weaver of tall tales as described by same.  What might we expect? Raised by a man larger than life (Albert Finney as the father), Billy Cruddup (as the son)has tired of his father's larger-than-life image, an image cultivated through a lifetime of storytelling.  So many lies and half-truths and distortions that the son cannot perceive where the truth begins and the disinformation ends.  And so the two are at odds even though the father is probably on his death bed. Director Tim Burton's fantastically exaggerated view of the father's early life is probably about right.  To put it another way, how would a liar describe his own life?  Well, certainly not any matter-of-fact recounting would be expected. There are enough diversions strewn in the film's path it elevate it to higher than average level.  There are delightful moments punctuated by highjinks that almost elicit a groan of disbelief.  Some effects look very good, the actual visual sensations illustrate very high production values - and we would expect that from Burton - yet there enough mild surprises to entertain.  And enough about the relationship(s) explored to stir the cerebral in us. But what of the father?  What is he really all about, what really happened and why should we care?  And do we resolve this father/son dispute? Imagine a lens that magnifies a person-sized object about 1.2 times.  That is what a character like that portrayed by Albert Finney appears like to a boy.  And does even as an adult.",7,0,0,14 January 2004
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," Memento Momentum
","Seems like we like films dealing with memory loss.  Always have.  But the recent Memento (2000) has seemed to generate a few more movies (there are hundreds, just put amnesia into the IMDB plot search engine)in which individuals have challenges - Mulholland Drive (2001) and Fifty First Dates (2004) are good examples, with even Ellen DeGeneres' Dory in Finding Nemo putting a humourous touch to the genre.  But did I say genre?  Because 'Eternal Sunshine' sort of backs into the situation in what should be frightening fashion but has us exulting in the ultimate outcome.  Jim Carrey's Joel determines that erasing the memory of his relationship with his long-time girlfriend will be the answer to the pain he feels when he finds she has had HER memory removed.  The lab and the technical background, the physician (Tom Wilkinson) and the technical staff (Mark Ruffalo, Kirsten Dunst, Elihah Wood) are darned funny in their own right, adding a terrific touch to the credibility of the situation.  What ensues, however, is not what we suspect will occur - at all.  And there is the reason to follow the excellent story as the director (and most significantly Carrey) lead us towards the memorable conclusion.",8,0,1,2 June 2004
Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy," Winning Effort
","`Anchorman' is a pretty darned funny movie and Will Ferrell has a winning release here, for the reasons that it is pretty smart stuff and will be a box office smash to boot.  Cut from the same mold as `The Naked Gun' series and `Airplane' we are reminded of Leslie Nielsen efforts when he was at the top of his game.  But perhaps the casting of Fred Willard more contemporarily ties `Anchorman' to the sarcastic treats `Best Of Show' and `A Mighty Wind', successful parodies which may have influenced Ferrell in lampooning the worst of the 70's.  	Focusing on a TV news team of the era, Ferrell (as Ron Burgundy, a local anchorman on evening broadcasts) looks, dresses and acts the part of a familiar subject (let's face it, Ted Knight was an original); a no-nothing hedonistically sexist talking head.  His teammates support the theme that TV news people have characters the thickness of a playing card and all the social skills of college frat pledges.  	Of the supporting cast, standouts include Paul Rudd as supporting newsperson Brian Fontana, Fred Willard as their boss Ed Harken and unbilled cameos by three Hollywood regulars.  Vince Vaughn reveals a wonderful laugh to us and contributes well as the second banana (therefore arch enemy of Ron Burgundy) in San Diego newscaster ratings.  Vaughn also got a chance to appear in two movies very recently where a fairly important, if not the main, character could not articulate a metaphor, was ignorant of common idioms and/or makes up historical references (see also Ben Stiller in Dodgeball). 	There was one item that became distinctly more noticeable and almost unbearable as the movie went on  this is the worst sound track in memory. As if the 70's weren't unmemorable enough, the tunes  all the vapid hits of that era  were chosen for the movie.   `Afternoon Delight' could be the worst tune of the second part of the 20th century; if you like rock that has an edge, this is not the soundtrack for you.  It might be argued that these were the hits then; well, no one should have to listen to 90 minutes of the following:1) Legendary Anchor Ron Burgundy Welcomes You To His Album 'A Life, A Song' 2) Ride Captain Ride -  Anchorman Medley 3) Sunshine -  Anchorman Medley 4) Treat Her Like A Lady -  Anchorman Medley 5) Groovy Situation -  Anchorman Medley 6) Carry On My Wayward Son - Anchorman Medley 7) Grazing in the Grass - Anchorman Medley 8) Cherry, Cherry - Anchorman Medley 9) Who's That Lady -Anchorman Medley 10) Shannon 11) Use Me -Anchorman Medley 12) Help Yourself -Anchorman Medley 13) She's Gone -Anchorman Medley 14) Afternoon Delight 15) Ron Burgundy's Sign Off		(Source: http://music.ign.com/articles/522/522968p1.html)	Christina Applegate (as Veronica Corningstone, a serious challenge to the all-male broadcasting station staff) generated just the right amount of lib-ness to her role and is a perfect choice as Will Ferrell's in-house competition.  She shows us smart, sexy and talented; Fred Willard has no choice but to make her the lead on the occasion of Burgundy's inability to make an appearance for the nightly news and she runs with it.
	The news team is composed of a sports anchor (Champ Kind, played by David Koechner); Brian Fontana (Paul Rudd) - Rudd has appeared in 200 Cigarettes and The Cider House Rules and is far funnier than any of the other news team members; and Steve Carrel (playing Brick Tamland).  Anyone living in the Seventies knew a Brian Fontana, something of a disco ladies man.	So we witness the penetration of the news team by a woman, tension and finally all-out war between the local news stations and a somewhat tepid romantic angle between two unlikely lovers.  There are even two great lines that one can steal in the bargain.  And if you squeak out a few laughs like Vince Vaughn you will have covered the value of your ticket.

The Wrestler," Rocky Pales in Contrast
","I saw The Wrestler just after viewing Doubt, within about a week. I think what we have here are two ends of the spectrum, the non-action film vs. the action film, and I credit the Academy for recognizing both. It is nice to think, even trust, that Academy members have a broad view of what might be considered exceptional films. What the two films have in common is noteworthy acting. Give the edge to 'The Wrestler', and I'll tell you why.This is one heckuva piece of work, in every way films are measured. Mickey Rourke, as Randy the Ram, is totally believable as a fading wrestling star. Right from the beginning we see that his is not the life of a successful sports star. His painfully sad existence is evinced in scene after exhausting scene, sometimes with the people he has accumulated along the way as associates, and sometimes just as the camera trails along with him. And along the way we get a good feel for ins and outs of the gritty world of professional wrestling.His colleagues in this effort all do great work (Marisa Tomei's strong performance is eclipsed by her knockout topless scenes - there aren't many +40 year old actresses that look THAT good) and lend an air of authenticity to the people with whom with he associates. There is only one over-the-top scene (overacting) in the film, that involving Randy's daughter (Evan Rachel Wood). Wood is good at all other moments.There are really nice, even memorable, touches in this film. Some of the wrestling scenes are quite amazing; how do they not get hurt? Randy the Ram's fellow athletes and promoters lend authenticity throughout. Even the opening tableau of playbills, ticket stubs and photos from the Ram's past is smart stuff.Rourke's physical demeanor alone is fascinating to study; you really can't take your eyes off him. It is hard to imagine another actor extant that could have performed this role as well. While the ending may not play well with some, I am not sure it could have been done any other way, successfully. But that is why you should see it; decide for yourself if this the logical ending for what is not at all just another sports film.I give this film 3-1/2 stars.",9,0,0,16 February 2009
Ray," Seven Spanish Angels Took Another Angel Home
","The second fulfilling movie of the 2004 season is upon us. Coincidently, 'De-Lovely' allowed a superb actor (Kevin Kline) to show us his finest work, portraying an American musical icon (Cole Porter). No less can be said of the work of Jamie Foxx in 'Ray' - his portrayal of musical pioneer ('The Genius') Ray Charles is right on the money. That Americans love their music is borne out by the loving touches with which two musical legends are treated. Let there be no doubt, Jamie Foxx will battle it out with Kline for his portrayal of Ray Charles.'Ray' is what we would want it to be; a powerfully low-key study of a smolderingly smooth man. Director (Taylor Hackford) could not have found a more striking contemporary celebrity to illustrate how adversity might be overcome. Throughout the film one considers how really incredible it is that a blind black man from the South was able to fashion any success at all; that Charles wasn't just a passing fad but instead actually influenced several generations of Americans! The physical resemblance of Foxx to Ray Charles has been noted in pre-release trailers. What is less well known is how hard Jamie strove to accomplish this feat. According to Foxx he lost 30 lbs to play the role. (http://www.bet.com/Entertainment/jamiefoxxvideointerview.htm?wbc_purpose=Basic&WBCMODE=PresentationUnpublished).But the effect is most striking onstage; watch him make all those same small gestures we knew for some forty years.Ray Charles' life  poor boy to successful performer  is well documented elsewhere. But nowhere is the extraordinary triumph his life came to be so well conveyed but this film. The exact accuracy of small historical points fall by the wayside; we choose instead to step a pace back and watch the struggle of a man working by an invisible compass.Director Hackford notes that 'So from '35 to '65 is the focus of the film. To me, that's the best part of the story, it's where there's struggle, where there's conflict, where you don't know the outcome.' (http://filmforce.ign.com/articles/561/561191p2.html)And he certainly succeeds in immersing us in that era, one of the most singularly progressive periods in history.Ray Charles was part of that, and more, he was a player. Any critical sniping of the film comes off a bit 'sour grapes'. Why do we not celebrate a real American success story with a standing ovation? Because America is also the home of the second-guesser, the critic and the never-did. Ray Charles was the real deal.Rating: Four Stars.",Null,1,3,1 November 2004
Dodgeball," Up And Down
","As 'Dodgeball' opens we pan around the crummy living room of Vince Vaughn and find him snoozing on the couch as a TV infomercial (with the usual pitchman hyping exercise stuff) drones on in the background. He rises and in leisurely fashion begins his day, and like many of us, never seems to move any faster than at about sixty percent of his potential  for the rest of the movie. But this is perfect counterpoint to Ben Stiller's energetic creep-role, as we soon see.Vaughn (Peter La Fluer) is owner of a less-then- state of the art ('Average Joe's') gym coveted (as a parking solution) by the owner of neighboring and rival GloboGym (Ben Stiller as White Goodman). We soon find that Average Joe's is in deep financial straits, and it follows, as in nearly all sports movies, that winning a prize is the only possible solution to this dilemma. Of course the team Vaughn assembles for the big Las Vegas Dodgeball Tournament is predictably a ragtag collection of social misfits; rival Ben Stiller in response fields a team of ringers to circumvent the success of Average Joe's. While there are no real surprises in the outcome of the movie, the gags and one-liners we see and hear along the way make this a nice ride. Surprisingly there are a few references to homosexuality (generally movies either steer directly away from or head-on into this theme), and with the other blatant sexual innuendo peppered throughout 'Dodgeball' is a little edgier than the PG-13 rating indicates. The only portion of 'Dodgeball' that is really striking is the introduction of the Las Vegas Tournament and the subsequent few minutes as we see teams (all the sides  and we remember dodgeball as a junior high rainy-day thing where we lined up on each side of the gym and pummeled each other - have themes) eliminated in rapid fashion. This is truly funny stuff, and a definite shift up in the imagination gears occurs. The film then downshifts to the previous rather leisurely pace at which it had been moving.Vaughn is really the key actor in 'Dodgeball', although Stiller does give a fine effort as the revolting GloboGym owner. The work of the supporting cast (most notably Rip Torn, who in his career has done anything given the opportunity) does add to the overall number of laughs. Judging by the audience reaction (a nice mixed bag of kids, teens and older adults) 'Dodgeball' is about as funny as 'The Bad News Bears', which is not a bad thing.Rating: 3 Stars.",Null,0,0,7 July 2004
