Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," Entertaining, although I still prefer the first film
","Considering how much I enjoyed the first film and being someone who enjoys Sherlock Holmes movies and TV shows (The Granada series with Jeremy Brett series being the most notable), I was looking forward to seeing this film. Now having seen the film I can say I enjoyed it, this sequel has elements of action, humor, adventure, and camaraderie. Yet, it lacked a certain polish that I was expecting as sequels are supposed to be superior and more colorful than their predecessors. This film is not better than the first film but it isn't a waste of time either.Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law return as Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson. The classic duo of the world's greatest consulting detective and his trusted medical companion. This time they have to deal with a new nemesis Professor. James Moriarty also known as 'The Napoleon of Crime.' Along, the way they meet a gypsy Madame Simza, whose brother Moriarty has hold on.Downey Jr. and Law continue to have great chemistry. The way that they play off each other makes this almost a buddy picture. There plenty of action, changes in scenery as well as tongue in cheek humor. Jared Harris as Professor Moriarty is a much more interesting villain than Mark Strong's Lord Blackwood from the first film. Also, Noomi Rapace is a much better leading lady than Rachel McAdams was as Irene Adler. Guy Ritchie continues to show off his directorial style, particularly with the somewhat lengthy slow motion sequence where our heroes are running through a German forest with bullets crashing and splintering through the trees. The music, photography, and production values are splendid. It was also fun to see Stephen Fry as Holmes equally brilliant and eccentric brother Mycroft.However, although there were improvements in some areas, I still feel the first film is better as it had more personality. Some purists have criticized Guy Ritchie's Holmes films for being more about action and comedy then about mystery and deduction. I prefer the first film mainly because it was more like a detective movie where there was a good balance of both deduction as well as action. Here, it is more of a breathless action-adventure yarn with a second half that drags a bit. Also, the supporting characters such as Mycroft or Mary Morstan could have had more development.Still, if you don't take the movie seriously (which I don't think your supposed to) it has plenty to enjoy. Even though it was a lesser film than the first I might still buy it when it comes out on DVD. This film was a big success at the box office as well as with the public, so there will probably be a third sequel and when that happens I will be looking forward to it again.",7,1,2,11 February 2012
Sherlock Holmes," Nothing great but a stylish, enjoyable film nevertheless
","I have never read any of Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes stories but ever since I have come across the Granada series with Jeremy Brett (most of which I love), I have become fascinated with the entire Sherlock Holmes world and canon. So I was very interested in seeing this movie from the start. Although it is not the best Sherlock Holmes movie ever made, it is certainly a lot of fun.Robert Downey Jr. take on the character is not up there with the greats perhaps but it is uniquely his. His Holmes is often rude, droll, but his deductive brilliance gets him out of deadly situations.When bored he smokes opium while doing drug experiments with his dog. Jude Law makes very good young Dr.Watson as someone often bantering with Holmes and having to put up with his selfish and impulsive demeanor. On screen, Downey and Law show great chemistry as Holmes and Watson playing off each other very well. Rachael McAdams makes a good Irene Adler (a character from the story 'A Scandal in Bohemia') and Mark Strong is strong (no pun intended) as Holmes's nemesis Lord Blackwood.The script is full energy and is able to hold your attention from start to finish moving at a quick pace. Yet, Holmes purists may have problems with the fact that this movie has more action and adventure than it does mystery (which is not to say that it doesn't have elements that keep you guessing or that Holmes doesn't use his traditional deductive methods of investigations). Sherlock Holmes has always been a cerebral hero who rarely gets into fights but the Holmes in this movie gets into a lot of them and survives many deadly encounters. Still, taken as an exercise in escapism which is what movies are for, it does succeed.The film is cleverly directed by Guy Ritchie. He gives a special look and feel to the film. In terms of pure visual design this film is something to admire. The editing is excellent and the cinematography is first rate. The production values are superb where instead of showing Victorian Era London as beautiful they present it's alleys and street corners as dingy, grimy, with the air full of industrial smog. The music score also blends in with the scenes and imagery beautifully. Without, any doubt this movie is technically well made.So this isn't a great movie nor is it the kind of film that you would want run home about. Yet, taking it for what it is, which is Sherlock Holmes combined with action and adventure, I found it enjoyable. I certainly prefer it over it's recent sequel.",7,0,0,20 March 2012
