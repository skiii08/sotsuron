Requiem for a Dream," Addiction: A many faceted problem.
","Viewed seperately, each of the intertwining plot lines in this movie represent the same old drug-movie theme, that is: Person discovers drugs -- has lots of fun; time passes; person gets addicted; person finds out drugs aren't so good. However, when viewed as whole they paint a vivid picture of the monster that is addiction, and the havoc it can cause on it's victims and their loved ones. This film isn't really about how bad drugs are at all, what it really explores is the danger of addiction and the many forms it can take. I think this film would benefit both the older(40+) and younger(15-18) age groups more then they might think. Although, since this film is rated R, school children, who are in one of the highest risk categories for addiction, probably won't get to see it. All in all it was a rather harrowing and disconcerting experience, however, it was masterfully put together piece of work (the drug scenes were especially well done, since no sane person would want to see drawn out footage of intravenous drug use). I definately came away from this movie feeling as though it was worth the time. This film could do more to eliminate the use of drugs amongst teenagers than the entire coordinated efforts of America's war on drugs since it's inception. (but yeah they aren't allowed to watch it, it seems cool if they die in a gutter with a syringe in their arm though!) Rating: 10/10 (Must See) Caution: This film is of a very confronting/graphic nature",10,0,1,30 January 2002
