The Lobster," Please, for your sake and that of society in general - avoid this film
","If a movie viewer has occasional thoughts of suicide or self mutilation, do not, I repeat, do not see this movie - you will certainly be driven to act on your impulses. And if, kind reader, you are free of such maladies, do not, I repeat, do not see this movie. If viewed in its entirety, you will certainly join the ranks of those mentioned at the beginning of this comment. The only redeeming qualities of this film stem from the filming location - the gorgeous Parknasilla Resort in Sneem - which derives its name from the Old English word 'sneem' - 'the knot'. And that is how my brain felt at the end of this travesty - as if it was tied in a painful, hideous knot.",1,45,75,6 June 2016
Super 8," A waste of time.
","This film unabashedly repeats plot lines, scenes, characters...the list is endless, from many films of the past. It should have been called 'Super Plagiarism'. Just like the characters, whose home movie is a direct knock off of 'Night of the Living Dead', this film steals from films like E.T.,Goonies, and many more. In an attempt to get older viewers engaged, nostalgic bits are thrown in - Walkman, CBs,dope, 15 cent pizza (that was early 1960s, not 1979). The special effects, the 'monster', the central characters - old news. The scenes of bicycles, the military - cold, faceless - E.T all over again. The opening scene - straight out of 'The Sixth Sense'. The end result is a putrid, boring, waste of time.",2,4,8,24 June 2011
The Queen," Saturday night live skit on the big screen
","What a disappointment! A difficult task at best, a real life docu - drama with characters from a comedy sketch, this film is like the royal family itself....pompous, silly, full of itself, without character. NO one is even remotely likable. Seeing an actor in kilts pretending to be Prince Charles, what was that?? Perhaps it was the British accents, or the harried nature of the discussions (PM staff, etc.), but many of the lines were unintelligible. The only redeeming aspect of this film was the majestic scenery of the Scottish highlands. Perhaps the said could be said for some of the beautiful interiors and gardens. But if that is what you want, get a recent copy of House & Garden! Better off just recalling those events on your own.",4,2,6,29 March 2007
