Catch Me If You Can," A fun filled ride
",Just think this movie is based upon real characters.A fast paced movie which is worth mentioning.I don't have to say what would happen when thespians like Spielberg and Tom Hanks combine in a movie.We have seen a lot of so called popcorn movies but this one is the epitome of such kind of movies.I would be unkind if I did not mention the fine acting of Leonardo De Caprio.Some of the scenes are really comic.The first encounter scene of Abagnale with Carl Hanratt is really wonderful.Some dialogs like 'Do you concur?' are worth mentioning.7/10..Catch this one.,7,1,3,2 June 2008
In Bruges," Hit-man with a heart
","Ray and Ken are two gun men working under Harry. They were asked to hide in a medieval town called Bruges (in Belgium).Ray lives with a strong guilt feeling for accidentally killing a kid.Ken is a no-nonsense guy who loved Bruges.They meet lots of characters in Bruges and begin to ponder about their past lives and misgivings.Ken was asked to kill Ray and he refuses. Harry gets infuriated and decides to kill Ken for disobeying him. As the movie reaches its climax Ray,Ken and Harry try to clear their debts.I was fortunate enough to catch this movie soon after the DVD release.It was a immensely pleasurable experience to watch In Bruges.The cinematography deserve special mention for capturing the hidden beauty of Bruges.The actors did a sensible job and the storyline was excellent.At the end of the year,'In Bruges' will be appreciated as one of the definitive movie to be released in 2008.Two thumbs up for In Bruges",8,1,4,15 June 2008
Se7en," Ending is the strength
",The scene in which David Mills(Brad Pitt) shows his anger towards a news reporter(actually the murderer in disguise) is perhaps the most important scene in the movie.This scene asserts that David is the eligible 'Anger' victim.In my opinion the movie is not about capturing the murderer but the craftiness the murderer shows to complete his mission.Honestly think of Se7en with different ending then perhaps se7en would have ended in trash bin.The combination of Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt was definitely a strength to se7en.Kevin Spacey as cool John Doe was perhaps the strongest performance in this movie.All victims faced violent deaths and se7en would remain etched in the viewers mind for a long time.I wonder if girls loved this movie.8 for se7en,8,0,1,5 June 2008
As Good as It Gets," cant get better
",Its rare to get a movie which is meaningful and also simple at the same time.'As good as it gets' is a delight to watch.Everyone have weaknesses and the best way to overcome is to get over it.Jack Nickolson is splendid as Udall and Helen Hunt as Carol did an amazing job.Cuba Gooding made his presence felt in this movie.People like Udall are terrible outside but they do have a strong feeling of love and kindness inside them.A very good movie and definitely must watch for all Jack Nickolson fans. Movies like this are well received and I probably look around for similar kind of movies.7/10 for the great feeling this movie gave me.,7,1,2,2 June 2008
12 Angry Men," Movie making to the finest
","I had never felt a urge to comment on any movie but '12 Angry Men' is an exception.Never have I witnessed a movie which contained elaborate details about the psychological aspects of the characters. You have a caring personality,arrogant personality,a short tempered frame of mind,indifference,experienced,unsure,you name it.Throughout the movie you are entertained with clever dialogs and exceptional conceptions.The actors did a wonderful job and you cant find a dull moment in the entire duration of this movie. I wish all good movie fans not to miss out this one because movies like this is a rarity. Surely a THINKING MAN'S THRILLER.",10,1,2,19 May 2008
Hot Fuzz," why this fuzz??
","A enterprising police officer(Angel-acted by S.Pegg) gets transferred to a relatively eccentric town,where he pairs with Danny(a kind of stupid character) and starts poking his nose into mysterious accidents which occurs rather frequently in the town.He gradually realizes that more than one people are involved in the accidents and uses the 'BAD BOYS' Willie style to capture them and ensure justice is done.This is a movie which made Police look stupid.The casting was particularly bad and mindless mayhem which takes place at the climax was not funny or entertaining but in fact was pathetic.A 'B' flick which deserves no place among mainstream movies.If 'Shaun of the dead' is quite familiar to this one , then I'l probably avoid it. 4/10--God!I am generous.",4,1,4,22 May 2008
Juno," Im not convinced
","Juno,a street smart teen finds she's pregnant and takes unconventional decision about the baby.Jesus! I'm not convinced. 2007 was probably a unfortunate year for Hollywood.Great movies like Into the wild,Eastern Promises,Lars and the real girl were sidelined by insipid movies like Juno and No country.Some of the dialogs are worth mentioning and Ellen Page did a decent job as Juno.Micheal Cera looked stupid throughout the movie.Juno soundtrack was exceptionally good.Some lines like 'whats another 10 pounds ' were good and some lines like 'You know Babies have fingernails' were irritating. 5/10 for Ellen Page(I mean Juno).",5,2,8,22 May 2008
Snatch," Brit Cinema rocks
","I never gave a damn about Brit Cinemas until recently.Lock,Stock..,The Bank Job and Snatch are the movies I saw recently and I realized that British movies are not the ones to be ignored.I became a fan of Jason Statham in the process.After seeing 'Lock,Stock..' and after hearing that Snatch is quite similar to Lock,Stock..,I was quite wary but I found Snatch more interesting and innovative.I always thought British humor is quite dry but this movie(along with Lock,Stock) made to change my mind. Great direction and great acting adding to this movie has made Snatch unforgettable..I give 8/10.. Don't miss Snatch.",8,1,2,22 May 2008
Pan's Labyrinth," The best fairytale ever
","I have no words to express my feeling after seeing this movie.Screenplay,acting,direction,dialogs,camera work everything is in top notch.Certainly a fairy tales for adults.I've seen lots of fantasy movie but nothing comes near this one.Characterization was fantastic--Sergi Lopez will always be remembered for his acting as Captain Vidal.Captain Vidal will go down in cinema history as one of the most cruel character and the pale man will be remembered as one of the most cumbersome creature to appear in movies.The faun was lovable even though it didn't look beautiful.Be it Mercedes or the doctor every character left a deep impression in this movie.Some scenes are really wonderful.I always love to define a scene or two as my favorite in my comments but I really cant separate a good scene in this particular movie since all the scenes are magical. I particularly loved the climax which is bittersweet in my opinion.One will always feel sad for Ofelia's death and at the same time happy for her soul which entered the kingdom.9/10 for this lovable movie.Please don't miss this movie.Movies like this are rare to come by.",9,1,4,12 June 2008
Forrest Gump," The ultimate feel good movie
","You may be a powerful personality,you might have been in historic events,you might be a source of inspiration to others,you may be rich but all these things will not be a significant factor in your life if you do not have the person of your love along with you.I cannot remember a movie which I've seen more than dozen number of times apart from Forrest Gump. My favorite scene is towards the end where Tom Hanks breaks down after knowing that he met his kid and finally composes himself after learning that his son is quite bright(unlike him). Funny,Heart wrenching and ultimately heart warming. 9/10 for the Ultimate feel good movie..",9,2,5,2 June 2008
Gone Baby Gone," great movie
","Ben Affleck deserve special praise for Gone baby gone.He has given as a neat thriller.Perhaps I would like to call this movie as a perfect human study rather than a thriller.I cannot remember a single dull moment in the story.You need guts to arrest Morgan Freeman and Ben Affleck has shown us that he has a huge amount of guts.Veterans like Morgan Freeman and Ed Harris always add some spice to a movie and predictably they did just that in gone baby gone.Casey Affleck also deserve praise for carrying his role with perfection.I particularly loved the climax scene where the kid tells Casey that her doll name was Annabella.Similarly the scene towards the end, where Casey faces a moral dilemma when he sees the kid in Morgan Freeman's house is commendable.Gone baby gone is yet another good movie year 2007 has given us.. 8/10 for Ben Affleck and his gang.",8,0,2,12 June 2008
She's the Man," A fun movie for the family
","She's the man was predictable from the start to end.You can easily tell whats going to happen the next scene.The climax relied upon stereotypes. It was apparent that Viola was going to win the match for her team but still you can overlook all the negative aspects about the movie and have a good laugh.A great teen comedy to check out.Viola and Sebastian are twins.Sebastian escapes to London to play for his band and Viola takes this opportunity to find a place in the school's soccer team.She impersonates as Sebastian and finds a place in the team.In the intern she meets her love of her life(Duke-who is her room mate and the team captain).All hell brakes loose when Sebastian arrive a day early ,Olivia intervene and Malcolm tries to nail her.I thought Malcolm character was wasted.The character had a lot of scope. Amanda Brynes was amazing as Sebastian(and Viola).Story was ordinary but the movie had plenty of laughs. Stop thinking and enjoy the movie.",8,0,0,15 June 2008
Ratatouille," Only Nemo beats Remy
","I became a great fan of animation movies after seeing Finding Nemo and I had great expectations for this one also and Ratatoille didn't disappoint.One great thing about this animated movie is that this movie has a strong moral plot combined with entertaining elements.Along with Finding Nemo,Ratatoille broke the stereotype that animation movie is only for kids.This is a movie for everybody.A beautiful movie and certainly one of the best in year 2007.Animation industry is on a high and we can expect a lot of entertaining movie in years to came from Disney-Pixar.8/10 for Ratatouille and only Finding Nemo beats it..",10,0,1,23 May 2008
No Country for Old Men," No Oscar Stuff
","After the Academy awards ceremony, I was eager to watch this movie and I expected great deal from NCFOM.Only after watching it,I realized that this movie is trash.I simply don't understand how this movie made into IMDb top 250.A few reasons for my hatred towards this movie are 1.Characters are not used properly.I was unable to understand what significance T.L.Jones had in this movie. 2.Ending was pathetic. 3.The Coen brother's touch was missing.After Fargo,Big Lebowsky,you expect a lot from them. 4.I was disappointed after Llewelyn Moss was shot dead like a dog. The only plus in this otherwise forgettable movie is Javier Bordem's acting.. For his sake, I give this undeserving movie:5/10",5,4,7,21 May 2008
Into the Wild," biographic
","Many consider Into the wild as philosophical but in reality its better to see this movie as a biography of a unconventional lad named Chris Mccandless.Even though some of the thoughts given in the movie is good and the characterization is wonderful,two and a half hours is bit too much to bear for a slow paced movie.Certainly at least half an hour portion should have been edited. Nevertheless this is a good movie with lots of moments and certainly an different attempt but since this movie was slow moving and boring at times.I give : 6/10",6,0,2,22 May 2008
Pulp Fiction," a different experience
","No wonder Pulp Fiction will remain a cult classic and certainly one of the definitive movie in cinema history.The beauty of this classic is the variety of interpretation it allows.Multiple viewing always refines our thoughts about this movie. Parallel tales converging to a convincing ending is certainly a different genre.Tarantino and Guy Ritchi are the masters in this genre.Sometimes different screenplay makes a movie unforgettable and surely this was the case in Pulp Fiction. Pulp Fiction is a cult classic and one of the movie that will stay in the viewers mind for a long time but certainly not a popcorn movie(a spiritual movie in my opinion) . Pulp Fiction is a philosophical fiction with a tinge of humor added to it. S.L.Jackson was amazing as Winnfield and Thurman excels as Mia and not to mention Bruce Willis but I felt rather disappointed with Travolta. A very satisfying movie but not an entertaining(depends upon the way you define entertainment) one. I recommend 'Snatch' and 'Lock,Stock..',if you want a more entertaining movie from the same genre. My score 8/10..If you are a serious movie buff..Go for Pulp Fiction",8,1,2,21 May 2008
Hitch," Basic Principles--Nothing!!
",I remember exactly the day me and couple of my friends saw Hitch in one of my friend's place.We enjoyed throughly.Will Smith was amazing but Eva Mendes was irritating at some scenes.A perfect date movie and a good popcorn stuff.There was no dull moment in the movie.Its surprising to see Will Smith handle his role with a touch of perfection.I never thought he could do such kind of uncharacteristic roles. Kevin James also deserve special mention because almost all the laughs revolve around him.The ending was commendable.What else you expect me say? Go for Hitch and don't forget to see with your girlfriend.7/10 for Hitch--definitely watchable,7,0,0,5 June 2008
The Shawshank Redemption," Faith sets you free
","I have no words to express the feelings I got after watching the climax of The Shawshank Redemption.Very few movies touch you and still fewer stays in you mind for a long time.Shawshank redemption managed to do both.In my opinion 'The Shawshank Redemption' is the best movie to be made up to date.I don't really have to tell about Morgan Freeman,he is such a pleasure to watch.Some scenes are so poignant that you forget yourself.I particularly want to mention the scene in which Andy Dufresne plays the music in the loud speaker so that the prisoners be able to hear the wonderful music.The climax where Boyd Red reunites with Andy gives you a strange melodramatic feeling which only movies like Shawshank redemption,Forrest Gump gives.",10,0,0,8 June 2008
