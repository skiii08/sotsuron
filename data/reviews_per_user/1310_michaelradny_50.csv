The Blair Witch Project," The Blair Bitc-
","Whilst it was a fairly original concept for it's time, despite other movies like Cannibal Holocaust paving the way, it has now gone down as the trend setter for found footage film. A modern audience may see this film as another cheap, scare free, shaky cam, found footage movie, but if you put it in context to when it was released, it's quite an original horror tactic.Whilst The Blair Witch Project hasn't aged well, it is still fun enough to look back on and see when this horrible found footage phenomena started. It may not be as grand as you once remember it, but at least it's not the worst found footage film ever released.",6,0,1,27 October 2015
The Lobster," Mmmmmmm Lobster
","The Lobster actually takes a pretty interesting idea about love and societies views of it and creates quite a dramatic piece about it. One can delve deeper into analysis of this film, but even at the surface this manages to be quite a journey and entertaining movie. Whilst it defiantly has its moments, the one minor flaw that I found was the prolonged sequences midway through the film. However, with that said, it's greatest moments are in the films writing. It's darkly comical, political and touching (in an oddly sick way).The Lobster provides quite a entertaining two hours for its viewers, giving them something quite provoking and, at points, quite heartfelt. Towards the end, and I really enjoyed this, was a somewhat reference to Dogtooth, and without spoiling it, it was what put the cherry on the cake.",10,18,38,23 October 2015
Requiem for a Dream," Bad Trip! Bad Trip!
","Following four intertwining characters as they fuel their drug filled lives, this is as honest as drug addiction gets. Selling your body for drugs. Check. Becoming paranoid. Check. Hallucinating. Double check. This is probably the best depiction of the negative effects of drugs. Whilst not everyone that does drugs experiences this, this could be the extreme end that you end up. Excellent film. No doubt, if you watch this film it will have a profound effect on you. Perfect on nearly every level and brutally honest in its approach. 10/10 for everything, including the masterful performance of Jared Leto.",10,0,1,29 July 2015
John Wick," John Quick
","John Wick is most likely the most realistic, fast paced, bloody and insane action movie ever made. Despite some scenes taking you out of the moment, John Wick was a good surprise with a fantastic pay off. It feels so original and fresh that you instantly get into all the fast actions sequences and the story (unlike most in it's genre) is quite great and easy to follow.Whilst John Wick isn't quite perfect, it adds all the ingredients for it to be the best action movie ever made. It almost pulls off the impossible, but a few touch ups here and there would have made this film one for the ages.",8,3,8,14 October 2015
Fury," Furry
","Fury starts out gritty and ends gritty; blood, guts and faces flying all around the place in this violent war action films. However, despite a solid start to the film, the majority of it just doesn't pop, with boring action and fighting sequences, one dimensional characters and a pretty clichéd and rundown storyline. The final scene feels to much like a Tarrentino film, and doesn't fit in with the rest of the films pace and the suspense that is meant to be given just doesn't reach you. Whilst it is moderately entertaining, there are just too many holes and unrealistic scenes to make this a classic war film. Whilst I will say it is a different take on the World War Two battlefront, it just doesn't always connect.",6,2,8,11 October 2015
The Maze Runner," Into The Maze
","The multiple problems that plague The Maze Runner are unfortunately not counteracted by what's good with it. The overly cheesy dynamics of the films, including the dialogue, characterization and clichéd storyline, somehow make you wish it was better, but still compels you enough to want to watch it. However, the obvious use of forcefully taking the violence, language and themes down a thousand notches doesn't help, making what could be an epic sci-fi classic into an obvious money grabber for people to fall victim to.Nothing is worse about this film than the overly clichéd nature that you must endure. It's like watching a boring, toned-down version of The Hunger Games. If this added more Battle Royal than teen spirit, this film could have really come to life more than it did.",4,0,0,26 September 2015
The Secret in Their Eyes," Eyes, Burning
","Whilst I can appreciate a good film, The Secret In Their Eyes just feels too ambitious and pretentious, but for what it's worth, does come out with a decent standing. However, this slow burning mystery drama just doesn't engage all the often to make you want to care about any of the characters and any of the events. Whilst at a first glance this film does look different, it ultimately is nothing more then your standard drama detective film which falls flat after two hours.The Secret In Their Eyes just doesn't deliver often enough. It does have some mystery involved, but just feels too melodramatic that things become boring and slow. Unfortunately, this film just didn't feel Oscar worthy in my opinion.",6,0,5,17 October 2015
Black Mass," Black M-Ass
","Though marketed as this dark crime thriller, Black Mass is more of the drama biography type with little action or suspense. Though the story is something new and our crime hero is what I'd say unheard of, the entirety of this film does feel old and slow. On the topic of slow, this film feels long and drawn out, with a slow pace and a lot of uneventful scenes. However, what Black Mass achieves is something of an entertaining adventure, despite all of its flaws. At first this film is hard to get into, but if you hold it out some reward is granted. The pacing and action is what makes this film suffer, giving the audience very little to invest in, but Johnny Depp's acting (though not his best performance) is something that does make this film pop.",7,0,0,9 October 2015
Barry Lyndon," Barry Lyndon: A History Of War
","Possibly the most under appreciated Kubrick film ever made, and one of the greatest tales depicting the 1700's. But whilst it is incredibly grand in its delivery, it is long, and if you manage to get through this in one sitting, you should be awarded. But with that said, it tells a story like no other film has done before and it becomes one of the finest masterpieces ever made.It's not perfect, with its extremely long runtime, somewhat drawn out scenes and it's time difference, it still holds up today for being one big achievement. A Stanley Kubrick gem which unfortunately has been overlooked by many, but if you do get the chance to view this film, take it all in, for you will not regret it.",8,1,1,20 October 2015
Top Secret!," The Parody Culture
","Once a upon a time parodies used to be good and not cheap spin offs that grant easy cash. Top Secret definitely is in the class of decent parodies. Though dated, making some references hard to understand, Top Secret booms with more obvious funny moments making the modern audience laugh harder than any comedy of the recent era. The cast is good, the acting is good and the film itself is generally pretty good too. Though slightly dated now, if you've got time go back to this 80's gem to see what the hype was all about. Guaranteed to at least put a smile on your face, but unfortunately can be pretty forgettable. Val Kilmer at the helm, what more could you ask for.",7,2,3,29 July 2015
Incendies," Incredible
","Incendies is quite an extraordinary film. Whilst I did find myself with wondering thoughts at the start, it tapers off into something that is so engaging and riveting that you just begin to flow with it. Possibly one of the best films I've seen from French-Canada, this film may very well blow your mind.Incendies offers a new twist and turn every chapter up until the end. It is very hard once you get started to take your eyes off of the captivating sequences that are held before you. Not only does this film do a good job at storytelling, it also holds incredibly well as a commentary of war, religion and family.",9,4,8,18 October 2015
"Good Morning, Vietnam"," The Stupidity Of War
","Good Morning Vietnam is stolen by the Oscar worthy performance of Robbin Williams. With possibly the best soundtrack, second to that of The Big Chill's, Good Morning Vietnam also shows the absurdity of war, especially the Vietnam War, and the bizarre schedule and corruption of the U.S. Army and their agendas. Brutally captivating and hilariously funny, Good Morning Vietnam will get some giggling but most will be in hysterics. Gorgeous film made with such passion and love. Whilst some of the elements may be tediously unnecessary, the majority of the film is a fantastic Comedy Drama which will have your eyes glued to the screen and your stomach in stitches.",9,3,4,3 August 2015
The Bourne Identity," Born Identity
","The Bourne Identity is quite fun and faced paced, but really that's the only thing that makes this film watchable. The storyline is nothing new, whilst the cat and mouse chasing sequences (even though epic and thrilling) have been done to death. However, even though riddled with action movie clichés, The Bourne Identity does set itself apart from other films like it, with fantastic acting and a new spin on the secret agent idea.Even though The Bourne Identity could very well of been another James Bond movie, it does have some individuality about it. Whilst not everything is perfect in this film, it is a good one to watch if you need a bit of cheesy Hollywood action in your life.",7,0,2,29 October 2015
Hot Rod," Good silly fun
","It's fun. Pretty much enough said. It isn't all that clever, but it doesn't need to be. It's just some fun teenage movie. It's crude enough to release the inner kid in us and it's silly enough for us to realize just to take it at face value. Don't be too critical of this film, it is what it is and that's good enough for me. Fun little flick. You've probably seen it before, but sometimes you just can't get enough of these funny films. Don't take it seriously and you will have fun. Good night flick when nothing else is on and a good flick when you just need to wind down.Solid 8/10 for me.",8,0,1,28 July 2015
Bridge of Spies," Bridge Of Pies
","Bridge Of Spies acts as if you are ordering food at a restaurant (much like that one scene with all the food in East Berlin). However, you've ordered a rare steak and what comes out is a medium steak. It's the same food, and you'll eat it, but it's not what you ordered. Bridge Of Spies just feels too cautious in it's approach. The trailers were extremely misleading (tho I don't judge the film on that) and nothing really happens. Instead of the suspense and highly intense story I was believing I was going to get, I got a courtroom drama with a cliché side story instead.Bridge Of Spies is underwhelming, tho if you deal with it, the middle portion of the film is quite fast paced and well filmed. However, if you look at the two sides of the middle, you'll find a slow paced, uneventful, cliché riddled, classic Spielberg film and a classic Tom Hanks performance. Nothing all that new nor great, but at times enjoyable.",7,0,3,22 October 2015
American Psycho," Bloody and Brilliant
","This is intense. So much terror, so much sex, but above all it has so much fun with itself. Over the top intense fun. The film takes itself seriously enough to become a social commentary, but also has fun by exploiting all the horror and thriller tropes that we have become accustomed too. It is outrageously entertaining and an excellent film. Not as true to the book as one may expect, but if it was it would probably be banned. What it adds and takes away works really well instead of just replicating the written work to visuals. One of my all time faves, one of my earliest faves and one of my faves that won't be removed from my top 10 best movies of all time.",10,0,0,29 July 2015
North by Northwest," Up And Upwest
","Alfred Hitchcock dished something up more then fifty years ago that would change the way cinema looked today. North By Northwest was that film, and whilst at the time I can only imagine it was fantastical, it still holds up today, trumping most films that come out in the twenty first century. It's fast paced action, it's mystery and twists and turns and all the charm from its actors are what carry this film into cinematic history. North By Northwest is one of the greatest films ever made, both for its historic placement and it's utterly great story. It proves to be something more then a film, it's more of an adventure for the audience; we travel with Roger through this fantastic thriller, becoming apart of his venture. Possibly the greatest action adventure film ever made.",9,2,4,20 October 2015
Warrior," Warrior Hearts
","Warrior is a pretty engaging film, emotionally. However, with that said, nothing else feels all that striking about it. The film has a tendency to drag on and harp on some of the more uninteresting moments of the story, whilst it also tries to complement it with quick and fast paced fighting scenes which ultimately make the film unbalanced.Warrior was slightly disappointing, with it giving too much heart as to feel it is being to serious. There are parts which drag and become boring, but it's ultimate sin is inability to focus in on what the film is; is it a sports film, is it a family drama or is it a redemption story. In saying that, some of those genres fit in well within Warrior, but all of them together makes it oddly unsatisfying.",6,1,5,22 October 2015
Monsters vs. Aliens," Good For Kids
","Anyone over 5 won't find this entertaining. It's just another animation following the template made by so many other films. If there is any one good thing to say about it is that it has some big stars in it that the more mature audience can relate to. But all in all it is another bore fest that has been spun out. Don't expect Shrek quality in this one. Boring for the mature people, but probably be alright if you are younger and haven't seen or made the connection with other films. The monsters look pretty cool, but are pretty unoriginal. There is some heartfelt moments, but for the most part it's a been there done that affair.",5,1,1,30 July 2015
In the Name of the Father," In The Name of the Innocent
","In The Name Of The Father exceeds far beyond expectations. It's not just a drama about miss justice, but it also delves into a thriller about love, family and closing the case before it's too late. Whilst the IRA are a bad bunch, this film gives them reason to do what they did, and oddly enough, you feel the same way. The wrongful sentencing of the group was far more disgusting then I could have realized, making you nearly hate the entirety of the English courts.In The Name Of The Father proves to be a huge success for the viewer. A well invested two hours will give you the satisfaction that you ill be longing from the beginning. Truly a masterpiece from the 90's.",10,1,2,17 October 2015
X-Men: Days of Future Past," The way a superhero film should be
","This is an excellent film and not just a superhero film. It takes into account the things the audience want to see and what the audience doesn't expect. This film takes a risk with its non-linear storyline making it more of a high budget underground film with enough credit to go mainstream blockbuster. Hats off to Brian Singer for making something long time X- Men fans wanted. Not just for the superhero lovers, though it does help to get some context from the previous films. Days Of Future Past is the greatest superhero film I've watched in 2014 and possibly of the decade; yes I found it better than the Avengers.",9,0,1,28 July 2015
Spirited Away," Japanese Spirit
","The beautiful looking work of Spirited Away will catch you breathless from the get go, but sadly the story will neither entice nor enthrall you enough to stay focused on what's happening. The films story feels rather surreal and incoherent, giving no indication to what and why characters do certain actions. It also fails at being anything near original, muddling up previously used stories and creating one big jumbled mess.Whilst the story of Spirited Away may be hard for some to understand, one cannot leave the film without praising the artwork. It almost makes up for a lack of a coherent storyline, but for the most part the story does leave you wanting to know more; but to know more about what's happening, not about what's going to happen.",6,19,40,20 October 2015
Inside Out," Meaningful
","Possibly the deepest Pixar film I've ever seen. It's message is important and can be applied to every person from all walks of life. I viewed it as a mental health metaphor. Sadness is depression, fear is anxiety, happiness and anger are the two that form bipolar and disgust is the little things that can send people off. It is a really good film and not just for kids. Perfect in every way. Maybe if it wasn't as focused for children, the film could have dug further into the mental health side of things and made it more adult like. But realistically, this film has an important message that everybody should learn.",8,7,28,29 July 2015
Alien vs. Predator," Make it stop!
","The one thing that I really hate about this film is the location. Antarctica has been done to death with horror monster movies, think of The Thing. It's just a poor film. Could have been something truly great but it falls short and very short. The whole concept is out, and the acting is beyond terrible. But what really makes it bad is how the Predators, more or less, help the humans and there is this whole exchange in pleasantries. It is so cringe worthy. It sucks, to put it bluntly. Politely would be to say it is a steaming pile of dung that someone forgot to remove. Not worth watching at anyone's expense.",2,0,3,29 July 2015
Foxcatcher," Wrestle Mania
","Foxcatcher shines the light on two expert, real life wrestlers who are also brothers in this morbidly paced and themed movie. It's very serious, maybe too serious, but it's good, if you can handle the heavy melancholy vibes it through a at you. The acting is A grade and the story is great, sometimes flat, but great nonetheless. It's an Oscar film, but never pretentious and also never boring.A good film despite its heavy handed themes and atmosphere. It never fails to entertain, but if you were to be nit picky, you may say it suffers from some long and unnecessary scenes that feel as if they are trying to extend the already long runtime. You won't be disappointed in watching this, but make sure you are in the right mood, or the true effects won't grab its potential hold.",7,0,1,17 August 2015
It Follows," Finally, An Original Horror
","It Follows could be viewed as a metaphor of sexually transmitted diseases, or one could take a more literal approach to the film; either way, the concept is new, refreshing and above all, good. It Follows is apart of a small band of horror films that, in modern times, is very good, very engaging and very entertaining. You would be hard pressed to find a better horror film that doesn't rely on the typical clichés of the genre. However, if criticism prevails, It Follows fails in the scares department. The film is pretty lack luster in the whole scary mood, but that doesn't mean it's terrible, in fact, it's hard to see this movie being scary without resulting to clichés and cheap jump scares. A very good job to the creators of this film. It's original, it's probably the funniest film I've watched in a while and it produces a decent wave for other films to follow in its footsteps. A true gem in the rough.",8,3,10,6 September 2015
Rise of the Planet of the Apes," Not Worth The Actual Time To Develop
","When I saw the trailer for this film I could not wait for it to be released. On August 4th (the release date), I went to see it and was severely disappointed as it was not true to the original 1968 film. I found it was under budget, cheap and hard to follow in some parts. It was interesting, however, that the director put in some strange symbolism into the film, but this just made it more confusing as it just didn't make you follow the storyline. One thing that infuriated my were the actors. David Oyelowo (Jacobs) was definitely the weak-link in this film as he had a strange and unsuitable English accent that just did not suit the American country. Freida Pinto (Caroline) had the same deal as she had that annoying Cockney accent that just doesn't work in an American movie. Rupert Wyatt (the Director of 'Rise of the Planet of the Apes) has only ever directed three other movies before this and it really shows in this, what seems cheap and tacky, film. The storyline didn't develop properly and we all know what was going to happen anyway, hence the title 'RISE of the Planet of the Apes'. I believe that when they made this movie they took there own spin on the storyline a little bit, but then again added bits from the original description of how this all formed (Escape from the Planet of the Apes). Some of the dialog was good but the majority of it was corny and badly written.I am a hardcore Sci-Fi fan and I loved all of the original 'Planet of the Apes' films (excluding the 2001 remake), but overall I think this movie could have done a lot better if it had a more experienced director (i.e. Steven Spielburge) and better actors. The writer should be sacked for life and never show his face again and the design artist should be congratulate for being able to stand all this horrible commotion. I rate this film 2/5. - Michael Radny",4,10,26,6 August 2011
Legend," Legends
","Tom Hardy gives an all time great performance, double acting as both the notorious Kray twins. The story is also quite comedic, clever and full of some great thrilling scenes. One of the great things about this film is you know what you're going to get, and it delivers, then some. It's bloody on top of witty, charming and fun. Legend serves up one of the great films of the year, whilst also being quite modest in its approach. With Tom Hardy's already established terrific acting skills, Legend becomes something more then a typical gangster crime film. It feels invested into making the viewer content with its two hour runtime, whilst always respecting. The award for best actor goes to Tom Hardy, for sure.",8,45,70,16 October 2015
The Lives of Others," The Life Of Another
","The Lives Of Others tells the dark and mysterious story of the GDR spying on the lives of people in East Germany. It's a deep film that has you teetering on the edge of suspense, drama, mystery and thrills, as you develop your understanding of the characters and the lives they live. This is the East Germany version of The Conversation, but what's different about this is the historic value and the truth behind the GDR's controversial motives. One of the finest conspiracy films ever made. It's deep in detail, rich in character and beautifully shot. There is enough story for it to carry out its runtime without boredom, whilst there is also enough surprises for you to never be left on a linear story that may become tiresome.",9,3,5,21 October 2015
Amadeus," Dat Laugh Tho
","Amadeus is probably the most exciting film about classical music and Mozart ever. It's so wonderfully filmed in such an extravagant way, from the costumes to the set designs to the glorious music that plays from scene to scene. It may possibly be the best biographical interpretation of any person, as the film becomes alive with fun, joy and fantastical persona's.Mozart may well be the most iconic film about any musician. The acting is phenomenal, and Mozart's laugh is something that carries this dialogue heavy film through. Despite Mozart's childish behavior, you always want him to be on screen. Though the film is long, especially the director's cut, Amadeus is a fantastic film that will always go down in history as one of the greats.",9,2,3,25 October 2015
Unknown," Best Thriller of 2011
","There is only one word to describe this film, 'fantastic'. It would be hard to make this film any better then it is except for more action and violence. By putting away those points, the good points are exciting, entertaining, horrific and above all chilling and thrilling. The main plot seems innocent and straight forward, but as conflict rises you begin to doubt the movies actual plot and you feel like you are in this movie. Without giving any spoilers away, you don't want the movie to end and you don't want the end to be true! Overall the acting is fantastic. Liam Neeson has not lost his touch at all. The filming is great. Whoever filmed this is a legend at hand and should be commended. The writing and directing is also great and just will blow you out of the water.Make sure you put this movie on your 'Must Watch' List because you will be sorry if you missed it.Michael N. Radny - 9/10",6,0,1,24 July 2011
Ip Man," Yikes Man!
","Ip Man can easily say that it is the greatest true Kung Fu movie ever. It feels as if you are watching some sort of machine take down every opponent in a brutal fashion. It has got some Mortal Kombat vibes about it, but even so, that makes it all the more fun. It's also history based, even though I am rusty on my Japanese-Chinese invasion knowledge, it felt as if it bought some authenticity and realism into the film.Ip Man may be a film you put off, but if you get the chance to watch it, you will defiantly savor the good taste it leaves in your mouth. One of the best Kung Fu movies around, except for Kung Fury.",10,1,1,29 October 2015
Jurassic World," Jurassic Park IV: Better Than The Third
","It's not really the nostalgia trip I was expecting, but more like a revamped, better version of the third installment of the series. It succeeds at some things that I thought it would fail at, but it also fails in area that are obvious for failure. But the good, it was more graphic and unexpected than I thought. The dino fights were ecstatic and the thrill of the film was right up there. Where it fails, is the complete stupidity of the characters. However, knowing this going in makes the film a little more tolerable and less frustrating. A good film. Not like the original, but an exciting film. Would be better as a non-Jurrasic Park film, but we have it know and should take it as it is.",6,7,23,28 July 2015
Everest," The Coldest Heights
","Everest is a film that you know what you are going to get and it doesn't disappoint in that aspect. In fact, Everest may be something more then your typical Hollywood disaster film, with unpredictable moments and truly distressing, realistic scenes. However, with the fast paced action, you lose the ability to really connect with some pivotal characters and the film glosses over so many potentially interesting characters, that when some of them meet their demise, you care very little about their deaths.Everest left me on the edge of my seat for the entirety of the film. Unlike other films of it's caliber, Everest manages to surprise and makes you positively invested in the story. Despite the loss of characterization and the addition of cheesy dialogue, Everest proves to be the best paced film this year and good for some deliberate fun.",7,1,2,16 September 2015
Frank," Weirdly Wonderful
","This is a beautiful film. Heartfelt, Gorgeous and all of those synonyms. But where Frank truly shines is the characters relationships. This is a relationship movie that forms connections between each and every character. You like and hate every character for different reasons. Everything is so well set up, in the end you question who you are more like and who you would want to have as a friend or be in your band. Excellent filming and a bonus for the music. It may fall a little flat in parts but all in all it shines like a crazy experimental electro diamond. Good stuff here, don't miss it.",8,0,1,28 July 2015
Sinister," Sin
","While Sinister starts off like a cliché horror movie would, it does from time to time become original enough so that it stands out. But in between some of Sinister's great moments, there are long, boring and filling scenes which take you right out of the moment. I will commemorate Sinister for using original horror techniques rather then the traditional jumpscare, but there just isn't enough heart and substance in this film for it to be entertaining throughout.It does suffer from some poor characterization, writing and story elements, but on the other hand it does serve up some nice twists and turns in the story. Just wish the film was more consistent in it's approach.",4,0,1,26 October 2015
3 Idiots," 1 Idiot
","I feel like a fool wasting three hours on what practically is the Indian equivalent of the Three Stooges. With some context, this was the first Bollywood film I had seen, and it doesn't make me want to rush back and view more. The jokes are pretty unfunny, almost inline with unintelligent slapstick comedy and weird foreign comedy. Nothing in this film made me want to continue viewing; poor acting, a poor script and horrible cinematography are among the worst I've ever seen.3 Idiots may be a favorite in it's homeland, but as a foreign viewer to India, I had a huge problem with viewing it. The jokes fall flat, very flat and the story feels juvenile and childish. 3 Idiots is among the worst in IMDb's top 250 and I discourage viewing at all costs.",1,20,51,20 October 2015
A Clockwork Orange," All Time Favourite
","Number 1 on my list for my top 10 favourite films ever made, A Clockwork Orange has dictated my life and the way I watch films. Stanley Kubrick undoubtedly had a talent for good film making, but for anyone who has seen A Clockwork Orange, you will know he has a talent for visual film telling. A Clockwork Orange is darkly funny, disturbingly graphic and a subtle achiever of making you fear youth and the people in power. At every turn A Clockwork Orange reveals something you have never seen before and presents a faithful adaptation to the book.A must watch for any film buff, film lover and for anyone who is up for a bit of the old 'in- out-in-out'.",10,1,3,27 July 2015
"Salò, or the 120 Days of Sodom"," Fetishes, Kinks and Abuse - Not For Kids
","If you are more vanilla in your love life this film would look like a 'Two Girls One Cup' inspiration movie. But for those wanting to experience the dark side of the mind, this film has your name written all over it. Disgusting beyond belief; the toilet is not someone else's mouth by the way. When it was released this film would have stirred up all the left wing sitters with its homosexual tones and its hypersexual nature. Don't believe the other reviews if you can take the eye torture. This film is actually quite entertaining and fun to watch if you can sustain from throwing up. Disgusting? Fun? Bad? Good? It's up to you but I found this the best of the yuck! Just don't try and recreate their delicatessen dish.",8,4,5,28 July 2015
Sicario," Sick-ario
","Whilst if you look hard enough into Sicario's storyline, you will probably find nothing too interesting, but unlike many other films, it's the surface that really matters. A beautifully shot film that comes together with terrific acting and an ultra unpredictable and stunningly gory story. It never lacks charisma, giving you eye candy throughout the entirety of its two hours. But I will reiterate, nothing remarkable really happens; whilst shocking at times, it does feel a little one dimensional, but never lacks excitement. If I was to give Sicario's storyline one thing to be proud of, it's the fact that it melds two different story lines together almost seamlessly. Two peoples missions, with these two people standing on the opposite side of the law, whilst being the law, if that makes sense at all. A truly terrific feat in what can be done when not given much at all.",8,1,4,29 September 2015
Pulp Fiction," Not Just A Good Soundtrack
","This is entertainment at its peak. With an A-Grade cast comes an A-Grade film. Quentin Tarrntino puts up a superb film with this crime drama giving the audience a non-linear timeline to follow along with his mark of blood, swearing and insane drug use. Pulp Fiction proves to be one of the best films ever made and never denies the audience of good fun, fast paced, action packed entertainment. If only more films outside this terrific director would strive to be as risky and pull it off. A must see for everyone. Even the youngsters will find something to love about this hardcore film. It's not too bad in terms of obscenities and I think that just adds more to the hectic world that has been created. 100% enjoyed this from start to finish.",10,0,2,29 July 2015
It's a Wonderful Life," It's A Wonderful Loss
","It's A Wonderful Life may have been one of the all time greats back in it's day, but now it just feels a little too dated to be considered fantastic. Whilst by no means is this film trash, it just feels a little too old for your attention not to wonder off into pointless thoughts. However, there are parts in this film that genuinely are fantastic, some of which are quite funny and others being heartfelt and sentimental. It's A Wonderful Life may have it's faults as viewed by a modern viewer, but you cannot deny that it is somewhat one of the greats. Even though this film may be considered boring in comparison to the twenty-first century cinema, It's A Wonderful Life still has it's place somewhere in history.",6,4,9,20 October 2015
The Shawshank Redemption," Probably Not #1
","Whilst the IMDb users may disagree, the Shawshank Redemption isn't my number 1, maybe not even my top 100. But with that said, I have seen this movie a few hundred times and it gets wary. There is no doubt it is good, I may even say it's close to great and it has a pretty good watchability rating, but it's forced metaphors get on my nerves now and, in reality, is just another prison movie which is above average. Boring if you have seen it a few times, but for a first impression it is good. Once you start to analyze its elements you can begin to see the film for what it is. A perfect film it is not, but the acting is near perfect and the realism is somewhat accurate. Not my favorite film, not my favorite prison film, but give it a whirl and see how you decide.",8,1,2,29 July 2015
Straight Outta Compton," Straight Outta Cinema
","Being someone that doesn't care at all about the history of this music group, let alone rap and hip-hop itself, Straight Outta Compton was a little hard for me to settle into. At first it reminded me of eighties gangster films, before leaping into some 8 Mile type of film. Purely a personal thing, Straight Outta Compton neither made me enjoy the film, nor convert me to the hip-hop dark side.Though I respect the film and the hardships the rap group went through, Straight Outta Compton was not a film I really would invest my time into. In a current society where the golden age of hip-hop is emerging, I find myself running behind the bus, or realistically taking a different path. Not a film for all, but still somewhat fun to endure.",6,4,30,10 September 2015
Mary and Max," Marry Me Max
","Mary And Max is one of the most heartfelt, serious, honest and depressing films I have ever seen. It is unlike me to fall this much in love with a film, and yet, this film is just so dark and sad that I almost feel guilty for having it so close to my heart. The animation, the Australian references, the black humor, all combine to create one of the most sentimental films of all time.Mary And Max truly is an original film. Never have I seen so many innuendos in a film that create so much comedy, yet so much sadness. Admittedly, I thought this was a child friendly film, but it is foreshore created for adults, as they will only get the true struggles of loneliness, mental illness and darkness which surrounds the lives of so many people.",10,2,6,21 October 2015
What We Do in the Shadows," New Zealand Strikes Back
","What We Do In The Shadows is quite a funny, amusing film at times, which plays on the typical vampire films and stereotypes. It's probably the only good, true modern day vampire film around, which makes it vastly superior to any other vampire comedy around. However, What We Do In The Shadows does suffer from some relatively tedious parts, mainly the beginning, which seems to drag on and on without giving us much to work with.Though a very great film, What We Do In The Shadows isn't quite as perfect as I was led to believe. Whilst humorous and witty, the film doesn't live up to the hype and expectations, mainly due to what I can only account for as time fillers and empty jokes.",9,1,3,9 September 2015
Macbeth," MadBeth
","MacBeth is a known tale, even though I've never read it, which instead of degrading the film through pre-existing knowledge, actually surprisingly enhances it. It's dark, gory and pretty artsy as well, which adds to this excellent adaptation of a Shakespeare classic. If there was one thing negative to point out it is that the middle act does take sometime to get over and a few scenes which feature are pretty unnecessary. But with that said, the beginning and end are truly amazing and heart racing. Whilst adapting Shakespeare novels now seems overdone and clichéd l, this is an essential retelling that will go down as a classic. There is not too much to fault with this version and that's what makes it truly remarkable.",9,7,12,3 October 2015
The Martian," The Marsian
","Ridley Scott will direct your eyes to the most beautifully landscaped Mars you will ever encounter. On top of that, Sir Scott also directs a perfectly paced film, with enough chaos to enthrall you and enough drama for you to care for (most) of the characters. This leads me to my only negative point of the film and that is the space crew. Whilst two of the characters are well characterized, the remaining three you give little care about; and that is big with some of the more suspenseful moments. However, even though our female character is shown in full detail, you can't help but think she's been taken from the 'female, no emotion, strong willed' template that plagues so many lead female characters in clichéd thriller films. However, besides characterization, nothing will come close to the adventure this film gives you. It's full of everything you would want, and may even be the best film of the year thus far.",9,3,59,2 October 2015
High Fidelity," High In Laughs, High In Love
","What I like about High Fidelity was the fact that the humour was really well done and the story didn't feel boring and clichéd; at least at first thought. In my personal opinion, the first half of this film is fantastic, funny and sophisticated. The second half of this film fell quite flat with that typical romantic comedy storyline which seems to plague most of these films. But all in all, the film ends up being decent, leaves a slightly bad taste in your mouth at the end, but you will reminisce the first half to make it better. Good for the most part, but I very much dislike the final half hour. It seemed unnecessary and boring, but above all clichéd and typical. But if you get your hands on this film, the glory is the first hour; that is comedy that you will never see in a film again!",7,1,2,6 September 2015
Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby," Another Will Ferrell Film
","If you love Will you will like this film. Just Will back to his crazy over-the-top acting antics again. Pretty funny film, pretty new idea and a good concept. These films get spewed out every year and some to varying success, this one scrapes in as one of the good ones, but you can't help thinking it's the same thing being rehashed. Not a serious film, not a clever film but somewhere down the line it becomes entertaining enough to warrant a decent rating on my part. Good decent film. Nothing special, watchability is strong but nothing you probably haven't seen before. Keep going with these films Will and people will keep turning up. Hopefully he doesn't slip as he has a couple of times before.",7,1,1,28 July 2015
