Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," A decent film with some serious drawbacks.
","A good, but not great, movie.  Good plot and acting, but the movie was full of poor attempts at humor, cliche'd scifi ideas (c'mon-- a two-headed sports announcer?), and lack of development for some major characters.  A fun movie overall, with some dazzling effects, but definitely not up to the quality of the other Star Wars films.",6,0,1,20 May 1999
