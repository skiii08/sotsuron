Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Blinded by the Force
","The Star Wars that we all grew up with and loved so dearly is now dead. Sadly, this film does not live up to expectations, nor does it sufficiently engross us to make us unaware of its obvious flaws. Star Wars has always been a very simple story interlaced with a variety of interesting and spectacular moments that has made the jaw drop or the eyelids peel, but for some inexplicable reason, George Lucas has strayed from his original 'plan' in an attempt to please adults and children alike. Lucas uses child-like characters in a movie interspersed with political propaganda to try and accomplish this and the result of which is the self destruction of the franchise that made him so successful in the first place. Chinese and Jamaican-like aliens litter the screen as we are subjected to line after line of bad, stereotypical language that just doesn't affect you in any way except excercising the muscles in your face that affect cringing. Although this film did wow us with its special effects, they too were over done. The battes in this movie (except with Darth Maul) were horrible. You were not able to concentrate on anything as objects were being blown apart every which way. Do you remember the glorious battle on Hoth? Now that's how to do a battle.",6,0,1,24 May 1999
The Sixth Sense," Entertaining AND Intelligent
",Not since The Matrix have I seen a movie that truly integrates entertainment with intelligence. And not since Dark City have I seen such a fulfilling and totally unexpected twist at the end. Bruce Willis is surprisingly competent in this film and Haley Joel Osment comes up with possibly the best child acting job EVER!The Sixth Sense is currently my 2nd favourite movie of the year (The Matrix Baby!). 5 stars!,10,0,0,8 August 1999
