Walk the Line," Great job... enjoyed it better than I expected!
","I just saw this movie this afternoon, hoping but only partially expecting to really enjoy it. I had heard that it was good from a friend, which was the only reason I bothered to go and see it. And... my friend was completely right!This movie depicts the life (and love) of Johnny Cash. His start, his music, his tours, his dependency on pills, and his long time friendship with and love of June Carter. The parts were played played and sung by Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon. Did someone, or everyone, else know that Reese had such a good voice?? I admit to being rather impressed by her vocal performance in the role. Her acting matched. Witty, intelligent, and real.Joaquin... was pretty fabulous. He has a great voice, and his acting was superb. I can't imagine that was an easy part to play. He did it sometimes disturbingly well, with respect to the drugs.The story is good. It's filmed pretty well. The beginning was a little boring, I thought, but not bad. The end felt very slightly disappointing to me. Wanting *more* is usually a good thing, but this time I think there could have been a little more. I don't know, that's really open to interpretation.I can't say I have ANY idea if the contents of the movie are what *really* happened. I knew next to nothing about Johnny Cash going in. I'd never listened to his music; I wouldn't have thought it was my *thing*. After watching this movie, I am definitely going to have to get some of his albums.I gave this movie a 7 out of 10. It wasn't the best movie I've ever seen, but was totally worth watching and I'd recommend it. I may even see it again in the theatre.",7,2,4,5 December 2005
"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"," Best film (I've seen) of the year!
","And I'm not kidding. There have been a number of movies I was interested in, and looking forward to this year. This really was not one of them, at first. Logic holds that it would be my absolute favourite.I have rarely ever seen a book-to-movie adaptation that rivals this one. I say rarely, but possibly EVER. It was incredibly faithful to the Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, but that in and of itself doesn't make a great movie. This was faithful, and amazingly well done. It's almost hard to describe. The adaptation is quite possibly the best I have ever seen done. With exceptions, I think few people who have read and loved the first book of the series could be disappointed in this movie.What else can I say? I love Disney for making this movie. That I can remember, the last Disney movie I really liked was Pirates of the Caribbean. I'm not a huge Disney fan, in general.This film was beautiful, magical, childlike and yet adult. The most perfect children's story, come to life. The acting was great. I loved everyone... my favourite (of course) was little Lucy. I frickin' adored that little girl. But the whole cast was fabulous.I've already seen it twice in the theatre, and I would see it again in a heartbeat. Of the several movies I've seen in the theatre this year, this is one of only two I've watched more than once. I have *no* doubt that I will buy the DVD when it comes out.I gave it 9 out of 10. This is just a perfect Christmas movie.",9,0,0,1 January 2006
Pride & Prejudice," Different but surprisingly pleasing adaptation!
","I honestly wasn't sure what to expect when I went in to see this movie. I've been a little bit of an Austen freak for many, many years so I *had* to see this movie, but I had qualms. Partly wondering what Hollywood would do to this classic, and partly wondering how Keira Knightley would carry off the role of Elizabeth. I was mildly disappointed on the first, but very much pleased on the second. To explain one, I have to explain the other so I'll do that.The *worst* part of the movie is probably the fact that much of it felt rushed. They couldn't spend time on the different parts as they needed. It seemed like they were trying to make it artistic, but to me it still felt rushed. However, it was rushed because they were not cutting out nearly as many parts as I fully expected them to, so I cannot complain too much on that. Still, although this detracted from the enjoyment of the movie, I couldn't say that was what disappointed me. As my sister (yes, we are *all* Austen freaks) said, this was an adaptation but an interesting one. It's not in the mood of the book. Pride and Prejudice is heralded as Austen's most 'sparkling' story. Rightly so. This movie does not convey that feeling; it is more 'somber' as my sister put it. It's a different interpretation of the story. I enjoyed this even though it slightly disappointed me.I was really impressed with Keira Knightley's portrayal of Lizzy. As I said I wasn't sure how she would do; I was afraid she would over act the part, and spoil it somewhat, but she did not by any means. Her acting was definitely the best in the film, and I thoroughly enjoyed it. The character was slightly more somber than what Jane Austen has, but this was fitting for the rest of the film and done very well. She was witty, cute, and *real* for lack of a better word. I gave the movie and extra point for her.The rest of the cast was excellent too, in my opinion. Darcy and Mr. Bennet's characters were not like in the book but were nonetheless pleasing and very well acted. Matthew McFayden did a pretty fantastic job and I liked him a lot (this coming from a *former* 'only Colin' advocate, I must admit). My only problem with his acting was that in some few parts he delivered his lines way too fast. Still as I said, he was surprisingly good. The rest of the cast did the characters straight from the book, and very well.All in all I gave this movie 8 out of 10; extra points for what I considered good acting. The way the film was 'put together' was a slight detractment, but I still enjoyed it and would see it again by all means!",8,2,3,27 November 2005
Bram Stoker's Dracula," Certainly not the book
","To anyone who read and enjoyed the book, I would recommend this movie only to masochists. In my opinion, they took every single character that Bram Stoker created and systematically ruined them. Bram Stoker was writing about good and evil; this movie is sheer junk. I ended up fast forwarding most of it, and what I watched wasn't worth the tape it was on. Rarely have I seen such horrid casting; it is rank with repulsive scenes; the script was awful, the acting worse, and the makeup was so overdone it was almost laughable. This movie should have gotten and NY17 rating, as no kid under that age should see this bunk, and to anyone who liked the novel, I would say merely that I regret wasting that much of my life on such vile trash.",Null,2,4,22 July 2004
