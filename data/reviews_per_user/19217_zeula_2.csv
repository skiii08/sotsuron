Minority Report," imaginative, interesting, but cold, and emotionless
","I guess, I've never been much a fan of sci-fi, futuristic, techno movies....... Although, this film is interesting at first, then, it starts to get confusing, and I got lost....... Especially, when I couldn't care less about most of the characters, when they seem just as robotic, as the movie iteself......! I dislike cold movies, where characters role display no emotions, or care for much about anything....... We are human beings, and we have emotions, and I would appreciate if they display those characters in movies........ It was especially funny, seeing police chasing Tom Cruise, while wearing some sort of flying engine, that allows them to fly......... They just looked silly....... Tom Cruise gives his usual creditable performance....... I would recommend this movie, if you like sci-fi, techno films, and robotic characters........",6,0,0,21 July 2003
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," the first movie, that made me leave the theater
","Well, that should sum up, how I feel about CTHD...... CTHD is a disgrace, to HK Films...... It's even more unbelievable, for Chinese audiences to understand, why it won Oscars.....!!! Let's just call it a MIRACLE!!! Supposedly, what's ''so-called'' NEW to foreign audiences, is what I've been watching, ever since I was born, and that's over 20 years ago......!!! I feel especially sorry, for Chow Yun Fat to be a part of this crap..... Since, he's such a major icon, and wonderful actor in HK...... Plus, Chow Yun Fat was never suitable for period costumes roles in HK films...... Chow Yun Fat has ruined his reputation, as well as his HK film credits, w/ this piece of trash...... The costumes, and art direction looked soooo...... awful & tasteless.......!!! (with the exception of two, Zhang Ziyi's costume in her first scene, and her red wedding costume. They were acceptable) Please believe me, when I say, there are 1000x better period costume dramas, and series in HK...... I swear to GOD!!! The only deserving award for CTHD, is the Cinematography...... Otherwise, NOTHING!!!I had high expectations for CTHD, when I heard all the good reviews...... I mean, how often do film critics compliment a movie.....??!! Geez, I should've known better...... This movie, is only surprising for foreign audiences...... I have never, ever walked out of a movie, before it ends, but CTHD made me do it...... This is such a dull, and boring movie...... Why the hell, does it have to be so dramatic......??!! It didn't make sense, when they included one comedic scene, when it seems so misplaced.......I don't care, if I'm Chinese, this movie is horrible......!!! It's such an insult..... Some of the wire scenes, looked so fake.......! I just feel so sorry, that CTHD won Awards....... I feel sorry, for the Academy, that gave out the Awards..... This movie doesn't even deserve 1% of it's recognition, and I can't emphasize that any more....... I'm sure, many HK moviegoers, who are familiar w/ much, much better HK fantasy period costume drama, will agree w/ me that this movie is a piece of garbage, beyond words.......",4,0,1,20 November 2002
