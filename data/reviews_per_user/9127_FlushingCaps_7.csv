Moneyball," Unlikeable people plus little baseball make this a bore
","I watched this on TV finally in November 2013. I am puzzled why anyone thinks highly of this dull film with no likable characters. The film shows how the Oakland Athletics ) won a division title in 2002, despite losing three star players after 2001. It focuses almost solely on general manager Billy Beane, (Brad Pitt) and his new assistant, a fictional character named Peter Brand (played by Jonah Hill). It is presented that Peter's chief contribution is letting Beane know that on-base average is the best way to judge the value of players.One night the club is going for the American League record of 20 straight wins, Beane is out driving to Visalia to see their minor league club. I guess we aren't supposed to know it is a 4-hour drive, because the A's are playing a night game when Billy decides to turn back to see the A's game instead. I should imagine it unlikely the Visalia club to have a game scheduled for midnight, so why was he driving there at that time of night to see the minor leaguers? My chief criticism of the film is they make Beane out to be rather hostile, almost rude, to virtually everyone around him. I hope the real Billy Beane doesn't behave like the movie Beane. There is one scene of Beane and his ex-wife and her new husband. For no apparent reason, Beane treats the new husband rather shabbily. I wonder why they included this scene since there was no follow-up to it, no other scene dealing with any aspect of his broken marriage. Nor was there any hint that in real life, Beane had a new wife himself. They throw in 2 or 3 scenes of him being nice to his teenage daughter. Since the film was almost totally about his work life, they would have been wise to leave out the small bits with the daughter altogether.Just like Billy and Peter, none of the players have any character development. Unlike the stars, the players are quite minor characters.As a baseball fan, I thought it laughable that Billy flies from California to Cleveland just to talk to the Cleveland GM about making a trade for a little-used relief pitcher. That was to set up Beane noticing Peter, leading to him being hired by Beane.Another laugh came when the two were together in Beane's office and Peter tells Beane that the left-handed reliever he wants to get from Cleveland, could only be wanted by 1 other club—San Francisco. Beane immediately phones the Giants and engineers a quick trade to get them another lefty reliever, so Cleveland will have to trade the guy to Billy. I dare say that a good left-handed reliever would in any season be desired by more than one or two clubs.The film tries so hard to make it seem like this new strategy of Beane's—look for high on-base average players, disdain bunting and stealing—he tells them at one point that they should never bunt, leads to Oakland winning the division in 2002. Facts are they bunted for sacrifices 25 times in 2001, 20 times in 2002. The did cut down their stolen bases from 68 to 46, but considering the center fielder they lost, Johnny Damon had stolen 27 himself in 2001, and he was replaced someone who stole only 4, the lower stolen base figure must surely be attributed to that more than anything to do with strategy. It was interesting to hear Peter telling Billy early on that he didn't want Johnny Damon, that it was good for Oakland he was gone. Many people in the game consider Damon's play huge in helping the Red Sox win the World Series two years later, and later helping the Yankees to their only post-2000 World Series title to date. The A's have one post-season series win since 1993, and haven't won 100+ in any season since 2002.I know the A's really relied on more than OBA, but that one stat cited in the film as being key makes it worth noting that the club On-Base Average in 2001 was .345, and in 2002 it dropped to .339. Their runs scored dropped from 884 to 800. I found it troubling that the real hitting stars of the A's, Miguel Tejada and Eric Chavez, each of whom drove in over 100 runs are not featured at all.More significantly, the key role of the pitching staff was totally ignored. The only scene featuring a pitcher, was Chad Bradford, who like a grateful kid approached Beane at the start of the 2002 season and thanked him for being the first one to give him a chance. This was rather weird in two ways. First, Bradford not only had pitched in 44 games over three seasons with the White Sox, but had worked 35 games in 2001 for Oakland. It's true he worked more in 2002, but he hardly would have known about getting a bigger chance before the season started. The other thing that was weird was the way Beane reacted. He couldn't wait to walk on past Bradford, almost like the 'Go away boy, you bother me,' notion of W.C. Fields.Even though I knew the A's haven't reached a World Series since 1990, how they've stayed competitive, which they indeed have, seemed like a good idea for a movie. But Beane seemed like such a jerk who doesn't know how to talk to people nicely. Peter had almost no character other than a guy who quickly comes up with numbers. And no other person's character was explored in any way. So we got not character development AND almost no baseball action other than what took the place of the old newspaper headlines in movies from decades ago. All we're left with is some people talking about the fortunes of a baseball team during one season, plus a few random highlights.",4,3,5,17 November 2013
We Are Marshall," Great Drama & Many Laughs
","My wife and I saw it over the holidays and we both thought it was one of the best dramatic movies ever! It was impossible not to at least have watery eyes during some of the scenes. From what I know about the history of the events, this was a very accurate film. I remember hearing about the tragedy when I was young, but it wasn't anything that affected me then, no more than any other sad news. I found myself wondering how I would feel if it had been MY team that crashed.I was surprised there were as many funny scenes as there were. They greatly added to the overall impact of the movie.This was a most powerful story. You don't have to love Marshall, or football to feel moved by this story.",10,4,5,15 January 2007
Trouble with the Curve," Entertaining Drama in Baseball Setting
","Since so many reviews here have detailed the plot of this movie, I will skip much of that. I wish to argue with the folks who claimed this was predictable.I also wish to suggest you ignore the review from the person who thought the high school kids being scouted were supposed to be 'Triple-A' professionals, one step from the majors. To miss that fact reveals that person missed a lot.I guess it was predictable that the stars, the father and daughter, who we are told at the beginning are not close, would become closer. You couldn't have this movie in any way if that weren't true.It was surely predictable that the young scout, Johnny, who was signed years ago by Gus (Eastwood), who came across as a likable fellow right from his first scene where he stops to watch some kids playing baseball and gets caught up doing a pretend broadcast of a home run (he wants to become a baseball announcer), and who seems to like Mickey (Amy Adams) right from meeting her, would develop a relationship with her. But, as with any romantic movie, you don't know if it will continue or not.As for Mickey's job at the law firmshe was insisting she'd be back for the presentation, that, thanks to computers, she was working on most of the time she wasn't trying to help her father. Since her firm was in Atlanta and her dad was scouting this kid in North Carolina, she certainly could fly back for the big meeting and then return to help her father. Anyone claiming they knew just how her position at the firm would be resolved cannot be telling the truth because the movie doesn't make it clear—she's 'thinking about it,' I believe was the line, with only the suggestion of an alternate path. If you can claim you knew just how that issue would end, I'll use the Casey Stengel line and call you 'Clara Voyant.' The issue of the hot shot prospect was whether Johnny's club, the Red Sox would draft him right before Gus's Braves could. I agree the title suggest that the young hitter might not be a good draft pick, not in the first round at least. But I certainly did not know if 1) the Sox would pick him and then regret it, or 2) if the Braves would pass on him, listening to Gus (and Mickey), or 3) if the Braves would ignore Gus and go with their computer guy. I don't see how anyone would claim it was 'predictable.' Or, let's say, out of 100 people we might have found about 33 who predicted it accurately.My issues with the movie were that they made Gus too grumpy and his relationship with his daughter too estranged. The big reason why he did what he did when she was little, came as a very definite surprise.I would have made this film less bitter and more lighthearted. I thought the actors did a fine job, and want to commend John Goodman for a far better role than anything I've ever seen him do, although in a supporting role.If you develop interesting characters, the audience wants to see how various issues are resolved. That they know (can guess) some of the plot developments is not a problem. There are plenty of things that aren't predictable. We cared about these characters, even grumpy Gus and that's why this was an above average film.",7,1,2,23 October 2013
Now You See Me," Check your brain at the door and you might enjoy it
","This film that begins with shots of four different people performing some sort of 'magic', mostly on the street (one in a theater) and being brought together for some unknown purpose, winds up mostly being about two police agents (FBI and Interpol) trying to stop this foursome from stealing more millions of dollars than they did in their first heist. The chase leads from Las Vegas to New Orleans to New York and the action is non-stop.We are never given any characterization to cause us to like this foursome, we know nothing of their backgrounds. This is simply an action piece where we are on a non-stop chase to try to stop their crime spree. Throughout the film, we are given whirling and spinning camera shots that can easily make some viewers feel vertigo. I didn't react that much, but was very bored with the fact that almost every scene had us spinning around the room.If you think about all that happened after its over, it is impossible to find more than a tiny bit of logic or believability in the entire script. There was no need for the mastermind to bring these four people together, and no reason to think they would happily agree to become wanted fugitives, particularly since they kept giving away the millions that were stolen.The magic tricks could not really happen on a stage, as shown, but are only workable through the magic of Hollywood.We never have any reason to care about any of the four 'magicians' nor their pursuers. I think the only way to leave feeling it was a good movie is to think no farther than to say, 'Wow, they had a lot going on in that one.' They did, but almost nothing in there made sense or was logical. You don't have to be Mr. Spock to want a film that makes more sense to call it good.",3,2,4,18 January 2015
1917," Doesn't deliver much in action or in character development
","Saw this on January 9 in the theater. I was eager to see it, having seen many, not all, war movies, including recently the much-better film Midway.A quick review of the plot: During the World War, two British corporals are assigned to travel, by foot, through German territory to bring to a colonel, orders to halt an attack that is to begin tomorrow at dawn on April 7, 1917. Almost the entirety of the film deals with soldiers talking as they pass through all sorts of scenery trying to get to the place to deliver the message. They converse, go through abandoned German trenches, encounter numerous rats and dead bodies and occasionally live people, including a fighter pilot they see shot down in a dogfight. If you're looking for great wartime action scenes, look elsewhere.That's really about it. We get to know a tiny bit about the two lead characters, virtually nothing about anyone else. There are plentiful scenes involving soldiers walking and breathing heavily, many dizzifying scenes where the camera pans around a room or an outside scene. I know someone who is sensitive to even TV shows where the camera pans around and believe she would have had real problems with those oft repeated movements during this film.As one reviewer noted, there are many cliche moments in this film, the kinds of things you seem to get in almost every war movie. There are, as others have pointed out, many things that seem highly implausible or unrealistic.Now I loved the TV series Combat, and they definitely had an episode or two that bore a strong resemblance to what this film presents. Only Combat did it in a 50-minute (minus commercials) presentation. Picture this as a three-part Combat. It just seemed to drag along, the same plot, just extended over two full hours.For soldiers in a hurry to get somewhere to deliver a certain message to save the lives of thousands by calling off an attack, our heroes seemed to pause ever five minutes to do things they need not do. They also seemed to veer off course repeatedly, to go through every building close to their route. I kept wanting to call out, 'Quit stopping for tea (actually a milk break) or to look through every building within sight. Just carry on with your mission!'Since this is a fictional film, we viewers are not even learning about an actual World War I battle, nor about the lives of real people. It was a visually stimulating film in terms of the bleak shots of battlefields and trenches and such. But I was just left with a sort-of empty feeling as it was concluding, like, 'So that's all there is to this?'Had it been made in the early 80s, with an 'R' rating, I imagine I would have heard some mild obscenities (of which we had many here) and a couple of F bombs. Since we are so much more sophisticated today, they must have had at least 65 uses of the 'F' word, including one non-com who must have used over a dozen in his 2 minutes of screen time. Note to movie producers: You can make a realistic, earthy film without having to weakly resort to cussing nearly as often as this film does. They used to talk about 'gratuitous sex'...this film truly had gratuitous cussing. It didn't advance the plot or develop the characters, it was just there for no purpose.I think my rating of 4 is accurate.",4,24,62,10 January 2020
Hoosiers," The spirit of Hoosier Hysteria shines brightly here
","The much-acclaimed movie about a fictional Indiana high-school basketball team that wins the state championship is set two years before the famous, real-life Milan Miracle that saw a tiny high school actually win the Indiana state title-when all 751 schools in the state competed for one state championship, not four or more-is a wonderful drama, with a few comedic quips and scenes that has touched the hearts of millions of fans, many of whom don't really like basketball, or sports in general.The film accurately gets into the heart and soul of how so many of the people in small towns in America, and most particularly in Indiana, really care about how well their high school basketball team fares each year. In other parts of the country, it is football that dominates.We see the new coach, Norman Dale, arriving to begin his new job of teacher/coach just two weeks before basketball seasons starts and encounter all sorts of hostility from people who make wrong assumptions about him, or who don't want a coach who changes the way things have been. He struggles to even get enough players to suit up, deals with the best player in town not wanting to play at all-for reasons that have nothing to do with him-and even has to endure a town meeting where he is almost voted out of a job halfway through the season.Slowly he builds character in the team, gets them to understand the teamwork it takes to ultimately succeed, and they make a run to the championship game in Indianapolis. There are many basketball scenes which is a joy to this viewer because I've seen too many 'sports' movies where we spend, say, 100 minutes watching the movie and don't see more than 6 or so minutes of action on the playing field, as the film spends almost all of its time on personal relationships by either coach or players, frequently the 'love story' the filmmakers always insist on including to draw in more viewers. However good the 'romantic' story may be, I feel gypped if the movie delivers very little of the topic it is billed as.Dale even converts a hostile teacher who misjudged him in the beginning, even though she found out about his past record of hitting a player on his team and getting banned from coaching in college basketball. He takes time to help out the father of one of his players, a struggling alcoholic, by making him an assistant coach and then putting him in a position where this assistant had to take over the team and plot a game-winning play. The coach does much for all the players, even the short guy who was just the team manager who suited up for practice so they'd have more than six bodies on the court.I've read some of the reviews on IMDB and am astonished to read people writing that they didn't care for it because the ending (the team winning) was predictable. At any murder mystery movie, where there are, say 6 or more suspects, you can find many dozens of viewers who honestly DO predict who the killer is early on. With millions watching, every character who is a possible murderer is going to be predicted by some of the viewers. Here we have a basketball game, where there are two possible endings for the team in question-a win or a loss. I know people two years earlier made similar 'predictable' complaints about the film 'The Natural,' even though the novel had it end the opposite way the film ended.It isn't possible to make a film about a sports team without a sizeable percent of the audience saying the ending was predicted by them long before it was over. When this film was released, there were surely a few million of the many viewers who early on thought, 'I'll bet they're going to surprise most of the watchers by having the team only come close to winning, but lose at the end.' End the film differently and THEY would be the ones telling us it was 'predictable.'More surprising are the people complaining about this film not being very good because it had too many scenes depicting basketball games. I guess they would hate a movie about Frank Sinatra or Elvis Presley's lives because 'there was too much singing.'One reviewer was disappointed they didn't reveal at the end what happened to all the players, and the coach, after that year. Perhaps that person doesn't understand the definition of FICTIONAL!What I loved about this film is the way the got the atmosphere of small-town basketball, at least in Indiana, correct. At an hour and 54 minutes, they couldn't do too much to develop characters more without taking out most of the basketball action. Sure they could have done a few things better-what movie couldn't?The two biggest changes I would have made would have been to skip the one romantic scene that wasn't important to the story, and not had all the gyms depicted have a vertical U.S. flag hanging backwards, with the stars on the top right for people to see. I have seen some arenas that do hang them incorrectly, but I believe everyone shown in this film was hanging wrong.But as made, it's surely one of the best sports movies ever made. It's better than most of the baseball dramas-which I say even though baseball is my game and basketball not even close.",10,0,1,2 March 2019
The Blind Side," Fabulous film fit for entire family
","My wife and I saw this wonderful movie yesterday. From TV trailers, my wife was more eager than I was to see it. We both thought this was fabulous! Sandra Bullock's character is clearly the star, and, as portrayed, she was clearly the driving force in her family--not that her husband was a nobody, just a bit quieter than she was.What starts as a sad, dramatic film, quickly moves to being a largely happy one with many, many things that made us laugh. One part that I liked involved the college coaches trying to get Michael to sign with their school saying lines somewhat like the oft-seen Big Ten commercial with all of their coaches.One reviewer found fault with Michael returning to his old neighborhood when he questioned if he had been used. I think that is what anyone in his position would do. As shown, he wasn't abandoning everything he had achieved, but wanted to talk to his mother.We thought the role played by Quinton Aaron was played magnificently. It is difficult to act while saying few words and he seemed most believable.The Tuohy family wasn't doing this as part of some crusade. They sort of fell into helping the young man for one night, and then continued. It wasn't all planned and, although he seemed trustworthy, they did take a risk.It was refreshing to see a lack of racism on display. The characters were believable, likable--for the most part, and most realistic. The story is truly uplifting. Knowing that it is true makes it much MORE of a great film!",9,4,8,30 November 2009
