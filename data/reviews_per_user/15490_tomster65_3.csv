Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," this is not a sherlock Holmes movie
","this is an OK movie for goof ball action. it even might be a bit intelligent. some mega critics said that its inevitable that Sherlock should be modernized with action. i disagree. we have Indiana Jones, star wars, aliens etc of action that fits its ORIGINAL story line. would anyone love an Indiana Jones movie where he played in the park with his young son, a nice feel good family movie? they might but not if you called it an Indiana Jones movie, he is an action hero. super man needs to fly, the hulk needs to rage, Sherlock Holmes needs to solve mysteries. were we given any clues so we could play along? did Watson try to solve the clues on his own and always get them wrong? well, i don't remember much of that.go ahead and make your action movies full of explosions, fights and the end of the world. when done with some smarts and common sense, they are great. i love them.but when it comes to being Sherlock Holmes, stay with Arthur Conan Doyle character. he was original and deserves the credit for creating this character by leaving him the way he was born.a few have said that this is what the new movie should be, that he has evolved. get a life please, there are a great many smart and intelligent movies made in the mystery genre that are very successful. so why mess with that formula? why? greed, the ignorant masses don't care and like being dumbed down by exploitation of action while smarter movies don't make as much money. having a familiar BIG character, BIG stars and BIG action makes BIG money. even if its not fair to the history.well, its not like Hollywood from what ever country they film in cares about history. its one of Hollywood's biggest flaw. they can make good movies by messing with history, but haven't even better movies been made by not messing with it? even if Sherlock is fictional, messing with his character is like making sparkling good guy vampires.",3,18,35,20 January 2012
Signs," war of the worlds/independence day vs wizard of oz
","if this movie was first, it would have been great, otherwise, the mix of movies it uses for its own is just that, unoriginal.  it even throws in a bit of a twilight zone episode and the movie about the hysteria the war of the worlds created, the night that panicked america.spoiler here.if the aliens were not the bad guys in the end and just wanted to say hi to a bunch of paranoid humans, that would have been original and intelligently funny if done right. if not funny at least original.",4,1,1,9 November 2002
The Matrix," two parts great, one part sloppy
","most of the story line was interesting, deep even by some comments already posted while the setup of the idea is deeply flawed and sloppy.while watching this flick  you have to wonder, : in order1, our hero comes out of a 'pod' healthy and fully grown.  if any one of us, including neo lived their entire lives in a 'pod' they would be far from healthy, if anything their whole body would be atrified, muscle wise. the age expectancy woudl be quite young, not likely would anyone in a 'pod' ever live long enough to be freed from the 'pod' at the neo did.2, the amount of energy needed to supply a body is either equal or more than what you could get out of them leaving the idea of powering an entire planet as impossible.3, i play pc games, sometimes i use cheat codes.  sometimes it takes hackers quite a while to find those codes when the 'matrix' that is, those who programmed the games, do not release those codes to the public.  this part of the story i have no problem with, the part of the story that bugs me the most is; no matter what game im playing, when it or the pc crashes, i dont die, i just have to stop playing long enough to reboot or start the game up again.so,  if the film makers were able to solve those little proplems this would be a film worth a score of 100% otherwise i cant give it more than 70%. i just couldnt take my mind of the stupid parts while watching a great wonder of an action flick.",Null,0,1,2 November 2003
