The Blair Witch Project," Worthless Tosh
","The only thing scary about this movie is how gen Xers will fall into line and start marketing anything just as much as the person paid to do so will, and don't seem to be aware they're doing it. It really depends on that principle of self delusion. And self obsession. 'I know I am FEELING SOMETHING...'. So it must be real. 
 Typical gen X solipsism. Someone that suggestible could actually work themselves into fear over...nothing. And they do, because you can see all the terrified ones that thought it was great. But if you don't create the delusion...well, you see the rest of the reviews. There's nothing there. They seem to recover though, if you look at the movie's ratings trend. Straight down to hades!Vapid, irritating, unconvincing, illogical, amateurish film making at its very worst. Over hyped by the hype machine. Gobbled up by the gullible. Yeah, there's real horror here all right!",1,3,7,4 March 2018
Pretty Woman," Utter Tosh
","'No matter what they say, it's all about money.' That's the take home lesson from the movie. Romance? Epiphany? Falling in love? No, money. 1990, the beginning of the 'Greed is Good' era. Reading the user reviews is really depressing. We're that far gone that people can see this as a Cinderella story. Having to work as a prostitute? Being paid to pretend to date someone? That's a love story? It is if you're a banal materialist. She got lotsa bling and things in the end. Happily ever after. What more is there to life anyway.Nauseating. Thoroughly nauseating. The movie and the glowing reviews by the soulless lucre mongers stumbling through life.",2,10,18,12 April 2018
Pulp Fiction," As Empty as a North Korean Grocery and Twice as Smelly
","Once again we have the phenomenon of Tennessee QT ripping off classic outside-Hollywood '60s and '70s fare, copying the superficial elements, and failing to deliver any kind of meaningful context. Hey, dude, there was a reason it worked in the first place. But, no, his acolytes will attend this latest black mass and congratulate each other on all the vacuous references they can recognize.This is a total rip-off of La Mala Ordina. The only thing he adds is some dialog between the hit men. He should've left it out if that's the best he can do.His biography should be out soon. If truly titled, it would be, 'A Typical Redneck Tries Art-house'. Sound pretty awful? Well, the movie is worse.",1,9,18,4 July 2016
