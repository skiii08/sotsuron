The Perks of Being a Wallflower," We accept the love we think we deserve.
","It is a movie that demands respect and challenges the audience. It is definitely not a commercial pictures but more of a critic's delight. Shot in a melancholy narrative style, this movie captured my whole attention till it's end. Read the book, loved it. Unlike various others novel adaptations, this movie does not deviate from it's original story as expected since author is the director. What most surprised me in this movie was the performance of Logan Lerman. Considering his previous disastrous films, he did a great justice to the main protagonist of the book. Miller was just as great and i think Emma also did good. Before i watched this movie, i was worried how they would execute the twist that is there in the story. But i was done exceptionally and beautifully.It is for those who loves challenges in a movie. A great delight to all the Indie fans and for critics as well in this time, full of comic movies in the the industries.My ratings:Direction - Good, Acting - INFINITE, Score - Good, Editing - Good.",9,0,1,18 July 2013
Gravity," A new breathtaking experience in Cinema!!!
","Being a big fan of Sandra Bullock, let me say this one is her best performance so far even better than her Oscar winning role in the blind side. The film starts slowly but with very beautiful and breathtaking outerspace scenes, and taking it's time to connect us to the main protagonists and developing a sequence of events which are least to say the most breathtaking, beautiful, thrilling and not to forget horrifying. By halftime of the movie i was deeply attached to story and the characters that left me crying non-stop.A truly revolutionary or redefining the idea of great quality movie making after AVATAR. Should not be missed by anyone. Easily one of the best of the decade.",9,5,9,10 December 2013
