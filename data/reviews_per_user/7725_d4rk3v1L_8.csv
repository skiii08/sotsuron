The Mask," excellent comedy of 1994
","'The Mask' it is a movie that causes to see and to see as many times as be necessary to stay happy, it is that Jim Carrey is excellent comic actor, and its performance in this movie, like in the other comic movie of 1994 (Dumb and Dumber) they have taken it to the fame that today in day has. Other comic movies as 'Bruce Almighty', 'Dumb and Dumber', 'Ace Ventura Pet Detective' they are others that should be in our collection of comic classics, and as an user he/she said somewhere around in their comment: '1994, year of good movies', '1994 Jim Carrey's year', I say that he's right, and I hope that the stupid sequels that ruin the original spirit of the movies like 'Son of the Mask' they stop to be carried out. P.S. Another attraction of this movie is Tina (Cameron DÃ­az), first movie where I see it, and that it is its sensual stereotype that has not had in other movies (perhaps in 'The Sweetest Thing').",9,0,0,11 June 2005
Requiem for a Dream," A pretty damn controversial movie
","I had listened on this movie and envelope their content, I never had the opportunity to see it in television, accidentally I got it today in my favorite video store and I decided to buy it. There is my opinion here: This movie is the most controversial, strong, descriptive and feeble that I have seen in my life, and that that I saw the censored version, imagine the uncensored version, I find an excellent option to see, and in my opinion, it is a fair movie to teach to all the drug addicts of the world, in the situations so precarious in those that fall for its addiction. I have not still seen the NC-17 version, and practically it would not be so interested in seeing it, since the movie left me in shock to see so much violence and crudeness joins. In the boards I left a message asking of what I got lost in this respect. As final decision, I vote it 9/10 for: Originality, Realism and controversy in a situation common to world level. Congratulations to the cast and crew.",9,0,1,28 September 2005
The Girl Next Door," The Best Sex Comedy I've ever seen!!!!!!!!
","The Girl Next Door is a movie that our hormones force us to see, especially if appears Elisha Cuthbert (so hot girl!), it is as seeing a dream: having a new neighbor that is a porn actress , she's beautiful, she's so HOT, and she also likes you. The general content of the movie is very good, rather, excellent, the only bad is the Stupid Bookless Cambodian boy that they have to bring (it is very stupid in his attitude). Nudity, ooh, I want to congratulate the producer, all the chicks are so hot that I've seen before. Hopefully, I wait that they take out another movie of that style, and if it is with Elisha Cuthbert, BETTER, I love that girl, she's awesome. I hope she continue this way.Anyone else who didn't like this movie, It Can Stick a Shot in the head...",10,1,2,5 June 2005
The Shining," psychological thrillers like this one, marks the rule on movies
","'The Shining' is a quite terrifying movie. the simple one made of go to live a season in a hotel of that species during certain time and with so much solitude (besides their ghastly companies) they already make it terrifying. Stanley Kubrick (RIP) it was one of the best directors in movies of the last times, and 'The Shining' it marks the rule.in spite of everything that said previously, I should say that I had left the movie big, and I have to notice that it should be more terrifying in its time, since right now they leave movies so or more terrifying than this, although I admit that that time 1950-1990 were top for movies of this type. My vote 8/10.",5,1,5,11 June 2005
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," more fictitious than I expect
","this movie in certain sense, is cool. excellent fight scenes that the R-Rating grants him, the topic in general. the only thing that I find ridiculous it is that they are too exaggerated when The Bride cuts him the arm, head or other parts from the body to its opponents, they are so fictitious that they bother. In the version DVD, you can appreciate all the combat scenes better, especially that of Tokyo, a tip that I read in a magazine that the version of Kill Japanese Bill (Region 3) the this scene of Tokyo lasts more and he/she comes to color, while we have to see it in B/W. David Carradine after Kung-ugh it continued making and playing very good movies like these. Today (12 June 2005) it will be used for the first time in TV for Latin America for HBO who have not seen it, syntonize it (I am already making propaganda that such) and good, I add that Kill Bill 2 are better than the first one.",9,1,3,11 June 2005
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," I just loved it! But I'm confused: better than first one?
","After it to have seen 8 times the first one of Transformers, I could not resist to see the second one at premiere and I can say that I enjoyed it so much, so funny, Megan Fox always so sexy just like Isabel Lucas (Mostly Megan hehehe). I congratulate Michael Bay by doing and to continue doing this kind of movies and I should confess that I am not big fan of the original cartoons is very possible that I will see it all.Linkin Park's new song 'New Divide', I listened it two days before the premiere in YouTube, but was not that good for me until when was in the movie theater in the end of the film, it fitted perfect like their first Transformers Soundtrack song 'What I've Done', please keep it that way!!! If there any chance, please, if someone of the study or the director himself, is reading this review, please at least name my city or my country (Caracas, Venezuela) for your next film!! It would be awesome and here we all love this type of movies!! I had to go, I hope this review will be useful for y'all guys, greetings from Venezuela.",10,15,46,25 June 2009
Man on Fire," The Best Film of 2004!!!
","There are many reasons to watch this movie: to see the reality that whips Latin America with regard to the kidnappings thing, the police corruption at continental level, among so many realities that we live the Latins. The performance of Denzel Wahington was brilliant, this guy continues being an excellent actor and that it continues this way. Dakota Fanning just by 10 years, an excellent actress has become and I congratulate her. The rest of the movie was of marvel, I have it in my collection. I hope that they are happened to those producing of Hollywood to make a movie completely in Venezuela, where they show our reality better with regard to the delinquency, the traffic of drugs or the political problems. They have been few the movies that they play Venezuelan land (for example: Aracnophobia, Jungle 2 Jungle, Dragonfly) they should make more, as well as they make in Mexico.The song 'Una Mirada' I hope that it leaves in the soundtrack, it is excellent. My vote is 10/10",10,128,207,5 June 2005
The Matrix," why does the matrix has you?
","Very simple, because it is a magnificent, well created, defined and interesting history that takes to many to admire her. But now I do ask, do you believe that The Matrix is real, that is to say, the concept that we are dominated by softwares and that? if you responded that yes, I tell you: YOU ARE A DAMNED DEGENERATE OF SH*T!, DON'T CONTINUE READING THIS it is necessary to see that the nerds ruins everything, and to think that one sees this type of movies at the beginning to see the scenes of fights and shootings, but while more you see it, it begins you in interesting the history, but to the long one you annoying restitution and it is left. And if not, a friend of the secondary that was obsessed with this movie that tired already, saw until it contaminated me temporarily the fever when they used for the first time 'Matrix Reloaded' in 2003, but he had a limit and I got tired of that, like to reject the trilogy during some time, but now I recapture with idea of giving his importance to certain philosophy (although in the VG already ridiculous the prophecies of Morpheus), the fights (in Revolutions that seemed a fight it Goku-Vegeta of Dragon Ball Z) and the movie that it lifted more expectations was 'Matrix Reloaded', where they became more fictitious, but even so, good. when I said that the nerds ruined everything, it is true, the example of the fans of Matrix and of Star Wars is an annoying point, because always one goes to those stupid nerds that almost prostitute to get some souvenir or article with respect to this type of movies. In spite of the nerds and fanatic who's in any aspect ruin tremendous movies like this one, my vote for 'Matrix' is of 9/10. P.S. NERDS GO TO HELL, DEGENERATES GO TO AN ASYLUM, FU**ING FREAKS!!",10,3,6,11 June 2005
