","I think the title says it all. I enjoyed every second of the movie! Worth watch and all other Marvel movies. I'm not a fan but when the movie is great, it's great!!!",10,1,1,8 May 2019
Captain Marvel," WOW
","My english is not so good but I want to give a brief review about this movie.
First of all I found it very amusing, entertaining and AWESOME!
NOT because it's #girlpower but because of the storyline. And I understand now why Fury has that 'pirate cover' on his eye. I really liked the movie and I recommend anyone who follows/like MCU movies to watch it. If you're a fan even better. But now I am confused and intrigued to know if Carol Danvers is related to the Danvers sisters somehow. If you're willing to explain or discuss this matter please do not hestitate to get into contact me.",10,3,8,15 July 2019
