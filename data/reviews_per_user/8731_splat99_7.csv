The Blair Witch Project," Spookier the next day
","I thought that this film worked extremely well on the first viewing (though in subsequent screenings the impact tends to diminish.)  To fully appreciate this movie you have to suspend a little of your disbelief, though not much, and put yourself in their shoes as you watch it.  One of the other comments mentioned how each night gets just a tiny bit worse, with the dread increasing as the sun got lower in the trees, and that was one of my strongest impressions as well.  All you need to let BWP creep you out is a modicum of imagination.  Most modern horror films rely more on gore and special effects than on genuine suspense, and it was really refreshing to see a movie where you NEVER see the evil.The odd thing, though, is that the film takes about 12 hours to sink in. I went to see it with my brother and his girlfriend, and we all three walked out of the theater somewhat underwhelmed.  We hadn't considered it to be white-knuckle scary at any time.  (My brother's girlfriend did make her cat get out of the corner of the living room when she got home, though!) But by midmorning of the next day I couldn't get the movie out of my head - it had corkscrewed its way up my spine and wrapped around my brainstem overnight.  It was MUCH scarier that following morning.  The scene where the voodoo-type setup was found struck me the next day as particularly creepy and disturbing (I think that scene was more effective because it used the simple material that could be found anywhere in the forest.  The transferrence of horror and dread onto simple sticks and rocks was one of the things I really liked about the movie.)  BWP stayed with me for a good week.  They should never have made a sequel, though, especially one that relied on elements of stock Hollywood horror films.  But I guess it's hard to catch lightning in a bottle twice...",Null,0,1,15 November 2002
Miracle," Captures the moment
","Just saw this last night and, I've got to say, it does a great job of transporting the viewer back in time (assuming one remembers that time, that is.)  This is a well-done film.  It's patriotic without being jingoistic, inspiring without being melodramatic, emotional without being sappy.  And the political background of the time, particularly the hostage crisis and the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, are neatly intertwined with the main story, without getting in the way of it or hitting the viewer over the head. Still, the 'scene setting' nature of the historical/political tidbits really captures the mood of that unsettling winter.   Kurt Russell obviously did his homework - his portrayal of coach Herb Brooks is very effective.  Possibly his best acting job ever.  But Brooks shares the spotlight with his team.  Using unknowns (except perhaps for Eddie Cahill, who plays Jim Craig; 'Friends' afficionados will recognize him) for the players - all of whom can actually skate - was the right way to go.  The heretofore anonymous faces reinforce the depiction of the team of young unknowns that comprised the 1980 USA gold medalists.  You can actually see them bond as they endure Brooks' rigid, demanding training regimen.  The result is highly realistic.  You believe these guys as a TEAM.   And the hockey action is, quite simply, the best in any motion picture ever made.  Particularly the crucial game against the Soviets, which (even though the outcome is known) is unbelievably tense.  And it must be pretty accurate, since Al Michaels' actual play-by-play narrative describes the action on-screen.  Makes me wish I remembered the actual details of the game better - I was a freshman in college, we had a West Campus party that night, and all other themes of the party were put on hold during this one.  Thanks to the evening's beer consumption, the game itself is fuzzy in my memory, but the excitement is not.  Finally:  Don't leave before the credits have ended...",Null,0,0,10 February 2004
Friday Night Lights," Exciting and Revealing (Warning: Spoilers)
","It is often stated that high school football in Texas is unlike that anywhere else in the nation - that it approaches the status of a religion. This is amply demonstrated in 'Friday Night Lights,' an exciting, yet in a way sobering, look at this phenomenon through the Permian Panthers of Odessa. The obsessive importance of the team to the town is everywhere evident, from the small children following team star Booby Miles around (all clad in Permian jerseys with Miles' number), to the signs on every business in town on game night proclaiming 'Gone to the Game,' to the unsolicited play-calling advice boosters and other citizens force upon Coach Gaines (Billy Bob Thornton.) And the fact that literally everyone is constantly asking the big question: 'Are you going to win State?'Also part of the atmosphere is the pressure put on the kids (after all, they are still kids, even the seniors) by coaches, classmates, neighbors and (above all) parents. They are expected to perform no matter what their personal problems might be. A seriously ill mother or an alcoholic and abusive father are no excuse for even a partial lack of focus on the gridiron. Most of these kids see the team as their only road to a college education, and thus a chance to get the hell out of Odessa. In a revealing moment, two players tell a third that he has it made even if they lose, because at least he has the grades - implying that the rest of them don't.Or perhaps the rest have grades, but not meaningful ones. Another revealing moment comes when star running back Miles, being interviewed by so many reporters that you'd think he was in the NFL, is asked about his grades and answers, 'I get straight A's - I play football.' The downside of this all-too-common phenomenon is highlighted when Miles suffers a serious injury, and suddenly realizes that, without football, he has nothing to fall back on.The town also looks the other way when students drink, and in fact encourage it, to the somewhat creepy point of thirty-year-olds inviting high school kids to keg parties.The special treatment, however dubious, is secondary to the main story, a classic Cinderella story in which Thornton's small-town team makes a run towards the state playoffs and a possible shot at the title. I'm glad I did not know how things turned out in real life (the season in question was 1988) because the movie does an excellent job at keeping up the mystery - once the team has lost a game, the playoff shot is in doubt, and the suspense just keeps building as the season progresses. And you really want these kids to win - you become a fan of the team.The football action itself is excellent - gritty, hard-hitting, exciting and realistic, if perhaps a tad too polished for a high school team (even a good one.) But it is among the best ever seen on the big screen.Thornton does a good job portraying the embattled coach, upon whom the town's hopes fall and who is subject to the kind of second-guessing usually reserved for the pros. Not to mention verbal abuse, in person and on radio, when the team loses (though I must admit that the plethora of 'for sale' signs placed on his lawn after the first team loss is hilarious.) And Thornton's halftime speech in Permian's biggest game of the season is fantastic. Tim McGraw is effective and believable as the abusive father of one of the players, despite the seemingly limited range of facial expression he displays (or so it seemed to me. In any case, he has more facial range than Steven Seagal or Chuck Norris, at least.) But the real stars of the movie are the actors portraying the players themselves - all are quite good.About the only thing that I found somewhat 'Hollywood' was the instant reconciliation between McGraw and his son, once the latter (who has had a problem all season with fumbling) has a great final game. I love football - I miss playing it, though my knees don't - but the concept of one key 'big game' performance canceling out a culture of abuse doesn't sit well with me, and seems far-fetched. (Relatives of the father/son in question have posted on the boards saying that the two have always had a good relationship, and that the abuse was grossly exaggerated if not invented outright. Which certainly supports my 'Hollywood' view of this aspect.)But overall, this is a marvelous film for anyone that enjoys football, and even, I'd wager, for those that don't. It's well-worth your money and time.",Null,0,1,20 October 2004
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," A DELIGHT
","Just saw it last night and I've got to say, what a fun movie!  Lots of humor and adventure, an interesting (if at times overly-convoluted) plot, and an over-the-top performance by Johnny Depp, who unquestionably carries the film.  I have heard that Depp consciously modeled his performance on Keith Richards, remarking that pirates were the rock stars of their day. Well, it works like gangbusters!  The support is good too, though nowhere near Depp's level.  And the female lead is certainly easy on the eyes.  The special effects, particularly as regards the ghost pirates, are good as well.  Overall, this is the kind of film you can just sit back and enjoy, without having to think too much if at all.  And well worth the time and money at a first-run theater.  Hell, I had so much fun watching it that I didn't even mind the blatant Disney commercialism underlying the venture...",8,0,1,31 July 2003
Bloody Sunday," Gritty and Powerful
","I have seen 'Bloody Sunday' twice now - once on the big screen and once on DVD - and read Don Mullen's book, 'Eyewitness Bloody Sunday.'  This movie is a very realistic depiction of the defining moment of the 'troubles' in Northern Ireland.  The hand-held cameras and grainy film style make it feel more like a documentary than a movie, which of course is the intent.  As another reviewer has mentioned, the acting is very natural throughout.  It does take some time to get started, but once the the shooting starts it hits the viewer like a sledgehammer.  Very powerful.     The film jumps so frequently from scene to scene that at times it is distracting, though I was much less annoyed by this the second time around. And, having seen it once with and once without subtitles, I must say that although the subtitles (optional on the DVD) are intrusive they are quite welcome.  I love the Irish accent but at times it can be difficult for me to decipher,and much of the dialogue in the movie is muted.  It was good to know what was being said.      As for the objectivity, of course the movie is slanted - so was the situation.  But it is not unreasonably slanted.  The British are not shown as one-dimensional demons - in particular, Nicholas Farrell does a great job of conveying Brigadier Mclellan's ambiguity and even disapproval of the course taken against his wishes by the supposed 'Observer,' Maj. Gen. Ford (who, if the movie has a villain, is the prime candidate.)  At one point early on several Paras are discussing the day's prospects, and reveal how tired they are of being harassed, shot at and otherwise abused by the native population.  This makes the day's events more understandable.  This does not EXCUSE the cold-blooded gunning down of 27 people - there is no excuse for that - but at least one can see a contributing factor.  And protesters are shown, once or twice, firing back.  (The key here is firing BACK - evidence indicates that no marchers fired until the first two protesters were wounded.  And those scattered few that attempted return fire were quickly dissuaded by their countrymen.  Later in the day the IRA did go into action, but not until after the bloodletting in Bogside was over with.)  Ivan Cooper's (James Nesbitt) words at the close of the film were shown to be all too true in the years since the actual incident.  The IRA was on unsteady legs at the time, but has never lacked support since January 30, 1972.     The film is a powerful object lesson concerning the misuse of force, and one that governments everywhere - including my own country, the United States - should take to heart.  It has a few flaws, but I think deserves the awards it has received.  8/10 points.",8,74,88,22 May 2003
The Alamo," Good History, but too much Disney (Spoilers within)
","This movie generated much heat on the discussion boards, well before it even opened in theaters - much of it consisting of derogatory comments from Europeans and Mexicans about Americans, from Americans about Europeans and Mexicans, etc.  (There were some calm, reasoned observations as well, but these appeared to be in the minority.)  In any case, the sparring appears to have been mostly ill-founded.  While it has its faults, this film is neither a jingoistic pro-American lovefest nor a politically correct American-demonizing essay.  It is fairly well-balanced, though the Texian viewpoint is given somewhat more sympathy than the Mexican.First of all - the primary set (the Alamo and environs) was wonderfully done.  A lot of research must have been put into this careful re-creation, and it shows.  The battles of the Alamo and San Jacinto were well-staged and realistic, though with minor flaws (discussed in a moment.)  And the overall cinematography was great.The main characters were well-drawn and well-portrayed, warts and all. Billy Bob Thornton's Crockett was the best of the lot; if you take a painting of Crockett from about 1826, age the face ten years, and add a few pounds, you've got this Crockett.  There were a couple of ludicrous moments centered on him, but for the most part Crockett is believable.  His homespun humor, general humility, frontier skills, grudging agreement to fight, and even his unhappiness with the U.S. treatment of native Americans are all part of the package.  And his death may be the most accurate ever shown on film, if the De la Pena diary is correct.Dennis Quaid's Sam Houston and Jason Patric's Jim Bowie are accurately shown as heavy drinkers (Houston's name among the Cherokee was 'Big Drunk') and Bowie's role as a land swindler is alluded to.  His death is a little overdramatic - it is highly doubtful that he was able to put up any fight at all.  (And I'm not sure how familiar Houston was with Wellington's strategy at Waterloo.)  Patrick Wilson's William Travis is devoted, uncompromising, and yet in a little over his head - and also has deserted his pregnant wife and his children.  (His fierce devotion to slavery was left out, for the most part, but the rest is accurate.)  And Emilio Echevarria, though about ten years too old for the part, looks quite a bit like Santa Anna and played him to perfection - his ruthlessness, fondness for military pomp, and predilection towards affairs with young women are all accurately displayed. (Echevarria would have been perfect had he been portraying 'The Napoleon of the West' circa the Mexican-American War.)Balance was achieved, at least in part, by pointing out the existence of Mexican natives on both sides of the struggle (especially Juan Seguin's cavalrymen on the Texian side.)  And by noting, in a conversation between Travis' and Bowie's slaves, that slavery was illegal in Mexico.  And by showing the absolute bloodthirstiness of the Texas army at San Jacinto, where they showed that two could play the 'no quarter' game.The history was generally accurate, though telescoped in a few places.  A couple of annoyances were that (a) the Mexican band playing each night prior to their bombardment of the Alamo did not, as far as I know, play the 'deguello;' they broke that one out partway through the assault, and (b) that, while the assault columns did get into position very stealthily, the charge itself was ostentatious, with the 'adelante' being bugled.  (In the movie, the troops are practically at the wall before Crockett discovers them.  At least the attack is correctly portrayed as taking place before dawn.)  And both armies look great - the Mexicans with regular uniforms for the most part, the Alamo defenders in varied dress common at the time (including top hats, beaver hats, etc.)Also, the troops under Fannin at Goliad are mentioned a couple of times, but then the thread disappears.  In actuality, their fate was known to the troops at San Jacinto, who shouted 'Remember Goliad' as well as 'Remember The Alamo' during their attack.Most of this is forgivable.  What truly mars the film is the presence of a few cheesy Disney moments.  Crockett's musical duel with Santa Anna's band is silly (though he did have such a 'duel' inside the Alamo, against a Scotsman playing bagpipes.)  The most ludicrous scene is Crockett shooting off one of Santa Anna's epaulets.  Absolutely preposterous.  And they overdid the displaying of Bowie's legendary knife (though the knife itself looked about right.)  There are a few other such moments in the movie, and they are objectionable enough to drag it down to perhaps a 6.5 in my book.
But it is still the most accurate Alamo tale yet put to film.",Null,0,0,13 April 2004
Groundhog Day," Wonderful film
","Watched the DVD last night - first time in a while I've seen it in its entirety.  It never gets old.  It's one of those movies that is completely compelling - anytime I run across it on TV, I have to watch it, even if it's near the end already.  To put it plainly:  I can watch it over and over and over again...LOL",Null,1,2,2 January 2004
