Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Like it more each time...
","The Phantom Menace needs further viewings for the 'jaded' Star Wars fan (you know who you are...).  I'll admit, the middle exposition seemed slow, and the pacing seemed inconsistent, the first time I saw the movie.  But on the second viewing, I was able to relax and just be entertained, rather than try to nit-pick the movie apart.  Excellent addition to the Star Wars family!",10,0,0,28 May 1999
