Lucky Number Slevin," Blood with doses of black humor
","Wow.This movie was smart, a brilliant script with lots of dose of black humor and with lots of blood like Tarantino movies.If you liked wicker pack you will love this movie as for me its even better.I like the direction of the film you can see some innovations and surely the director is experimenting more with the camera. Bruce Willis is excellent as the hit-man and gives a class to the film.I don't think that the film would be so good without him as he does make the perfect hit-man.Harnett is excellent, you can see that he is very talented and manage to confuse as until the last minute.Lucy Liu is a great actress I would love to see her more and in this film she is adorable. Usually in such films the humor is inexistent but not in this one.Go and see it, don't miss it!",10,2,5,20 August 2006
