Requiem for a Dream," Depressing and gripping, but a masterpiece
","Great performances from the four protagonists, but a little unevenly balanced with less attention devoted to Marlon Wayans' character. No doubt Darren Aronofsky had a challenge trying to put the subjects to the big screen. Nevertheless the delivery of the movie is breathtaking and draws you in slowly, until the very end where you can't bear to watch, but you want to see it through till the end. Kudos also for a great soundtrack from Clint Mansell and the Kronos quartet.",10,1,2,3 May 2003
Donnie Darko," Bizarre, but interesting. Don't try to read too much into it.
","Just enjoy it. It's something different from your usual Hollywood crap although lotsa people have savaged it for trying to be too smart. I say, try this tale about this intelligent boy getting visions of a macabre bunny rabbit and decide later.",8,0,1,4 May 2003
