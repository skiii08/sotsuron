Blade Runner 2049," A slow burn but phenomenal
","I totally get the mixed reviews. I watched this movie twice. The first time shortly after its release. I was bored stiff and slept through most of it. The second time was two years later. I had even forgotten that I had seen the movie before but remembered shortly after the early scenes. For me, the major difference the second time around was that i caught the early explanation about replicants so i watched the movie with greater context. With that clarity, I could follow the absorbing storyline while appreciating the fantastic set, the sci-fi effects, and the minimalism of the dialogue (sparse and slow but weighty). It is truly a phenomenal work; I'm not surprised it won an Oscar. If you were one of those disappointed, I would advise watching again from the very beginning and taking time to savor the movie as a cohesive artistic interpretation not a shallow action movie. You may be surprised how much enjoy the movie once you have the right frame of reference.",10,0,14,20 December 2019
