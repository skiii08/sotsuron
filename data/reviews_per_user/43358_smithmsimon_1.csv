Blade Runner 2049," Amazing loved every minute
","Loved every minute, was totally immersed. I never felt the movie was too long just about right, maybe if it was missing anything was a little more action. For me inception is still the best movie ever made but blade runner 2049 comes a close second. Great direction and soundtrack, the movie even contained a little humor, and linked well to the first movie",10,2,13,8 October 2017
