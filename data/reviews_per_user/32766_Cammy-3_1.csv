Walk the Line," Ditto -- Best Film of 2005
","Really.I agree with so much of what the others who love this movie are saying: go see it.From the opening shots of the guard towers and the sound of distant clapping at Folsom Prison, this film had me.Joaquin Phoenix is amazing; he eats up the screen. Powerful and incredibly convincing performance. (And yes, it's him singing. Nobody is faking this. It's really him and it's really her.) And by the way, while I knew Reese Witherspoon was a really good actress, I didn't know she was THIS good... A fabulous, nuanced performance on her part.The music takes you through their lives and through a lot of the musical history of the 50's and 60's. Worth seeing in the theater for the cinematography and sound.",10,1,2,17 December 2005
