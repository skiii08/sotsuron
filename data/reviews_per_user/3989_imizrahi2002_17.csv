Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," read this ONLY if you want to further see how good this movie was...it's something i think most missed.
","first of all, i would like to dedicate this to the person who wrote the'opening' review. and i would ALso like to say that i'm glad IMDb had the good sense to choose it as the opener out of all the rest of the reviews. i've almost never seen a more eloquent review here. and BOY did he NAIL it...over and over...so. if you remember... liam neeson's character and the young obi and jar jar have just secured an underwater vessel from jar jar's people. they're cruising underwater when they are suddenly being pursued by some underwater behemoth that seemed hungry. and juuuuuuuuuuuust when it looks like they're toast... along comes this BIGGER creature to eat the chaser...(not the chasee).at which point, liam neeson's characters says, 'there's always a bigger fish...'. these words proved to be prophetic.again...great opening article, whoever you were...thanks. and people...? a six point five? who ARE you? WHAT? no HULK? too WHAT? did the political aspect put you to sleep? did lucas grow up and leave you all behind? WHAT did you want from this movie that it didn't have? i was STUNNED when i saw the score...i don't think it deserved the ten that i gave it. but i've always been a person who believed in fairness. and maybe it'll be what it needs to bring it up a tenthy wenthy. now i can go back to my cave.",10,12,17,29 July 2016
Wind River," i am soooooo happy you all 'saw' this movie...
","i come here sometimes to look at how others perceived a film. rarely do i feel i've seen a story(no matter the genre) 'perfectly told'. nothing that 'doesn't fit' added. this was one of those. and that you all felt it, too, is reflected in a much deserved high rating...good for you all. this was NOT a 'typical Hollywood film'. but, instead, to ME, one of the films that makes Hollywood great. just that they still will invest moneys to MAKE a story such as this. good on you all...and thank you. i wait for films like this.",10,2,7,25 October 2017
Don Jon," the people that write this film is vulgar and offensive?
","just goes to show how much of a chance EVERYone has to write an opinion on this site. to me, THEY are offensive. offensively dense to have missed much of the point. it's ALways amazed me. people's programed reaction to 'cursing'. which is usually a word synonymous with words that describe the same thing or event. except that THOSE words are 'acceptable'. i'd like to put you all in a room and rid the world of such stupidity, truth be told. i don't think the movie was about porn/sex addiction, either... i think we watched someone 'grow up' through some non judgmental questioning of methods and exploration of new possibilities. new programing, if you will...now for those of you that found him vulgar...could you be more specific, please? by which definition? here. i'll give you four to choose from...adjective: of or associated with the great masses of people adjective: being or characteristic of or appropriate to everyday language adjective: lacking refinement or cultivation or taste if you chose any of the first 3, i'm thinking you're a narcissistic, racist intellectual. thinking YOUR 'sense of order' is more 'correct' than those you look down your knows(sic) at.adjective: conspicuously and tastelessly indecent Example: 'A vulgar gesture' like the looks you get from those untouchables on the other side of whatever window/counter they work on when they get to misuse their authority...so pleeeeeeeeeeease save me from your prefab moralizing senselessness. and see the whole movie... now you may return to your magazines, TV shows, commercials and movies to help you figure out what new thoughts to have, clothes to wear and things to think hip. and btw, while this movie seemed to be a 'major accomplishment' to many that praised the movie(and there WERE praiseworthy performances), the writing seemed to fill in with form/style(repetitiveness) what it didn't have to offer past adolescent tries on first pair of adult dancing shoes... on the other hand(no spoiler intended with those last 4 words. this is a pun some of you might get), i can very well see how many teeners turning the emotional corner into adulthood might love this film through identification. maybe even justify their beliefs that all the machismo was just some beer commercial that peer pressure validates way past its expiration date...",Null,1,3,10 October 2013
Life of Pi," big, beautiful buildup...
","To a VERY disappointing ending...no doubt about that it was a very well made movie...and ang lee has, for a long time, been one of my favorite directors... but when i got close to the end of the movie...and the main story line comes to shore...WHAT a disappointment...! i really don't understand all the positive reviews...but...i'm glad others enjoyed it...",5,0,0,1 May 2020
American Sniper," clint hits the target with American sniper...
","it was extremely 'even'. nothing seemed overplayed. well balanced storytelling. as someone else wrote, best war movie i've seen in years...and while we're at it, best clint movie in a few outings, as well... i agree that the ending is a bit sudden. but there was no reason to drag it out, either... i don't feel it lingered on any one dynamic of what would be expected from a film like this...not TOO much violence or proselytizing/flag waving or lingering on casualty horrors... it doesn't, on the other hand, turn away from any of the ugliness, either... i thought bradley cooper did a great job in the role. the changes he gradually instilled into the character were subtle but present. it's as well done a war movie as i'll ever need.",Null,429,786,11 January 2015
Silver Linings Playbook," not ha ha funny
","i give it a 5 out of 10. (unless i explain this it's not a spoiler).very well executed. steeped in nonsense. some might call this movie 'romantic'. i'd feel sorry for them. it's not that i can't appreciate the artistry in the telling of the story. it's just that i don't see much that's based on anything in the neighborhood i've experienced as reality. growing up in brooklyn, many of the characters in the movie seemed familiar. but that doesn't make them any less pathetic. what's sad for me about having spent the time to see this film is that i wish there was something a bit more substantial that i could take away as a souvenir. instead, i'm left with a reaction from the majority of responders that does not reflect well on their internal workings.",5,2,5,21 February 2013
Avengers: Endgame," love requires the potential for sacrifice...
","This movie, pretty much, had it all...great action and drama...heroic valor...and comedy, in all the right places...
plus there were great cameos...it's long, but it doesn't seem as long as it is because the pacing is very good...
definitely recommeneded.",9,2,4,21 May 2019
Mr. Nobody," i've read every other review thus far submitted...
","and i agree with all of them... the pans and the praises...all. i can understand why some loved its originality and some thought it wholly unoriginal. why some loved the soundtrack and some were put off by it. this movie doesn't allow for a firm foothold, alas. and that's hard for some, going through an intense two hour cinematic/storytelling journey and never feeling like ones feet are touching solid ground. very disorienting. still...i feel like the writer/director hit his mark with every shot he took. and that it is not for those who don't want to work to expand their definition of what good storytelling can be. works of genius are rarely appreciated in their own time. not totally true here, but enough so for me to make these comments... if you make the trip, you may not fully understand where you've been, but you will have no doubt feel as if you've traveled the expanse of time/creation.",Null,4,17,8 June 2010
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales," can you say cacaribbean?
","why is it that every time one of these comes out i think, 'maybe THIS one?' all the special effects and salary money...for naught, imo. and stupid joke after stupid joke...i haven't wished for an ending so hard for a LONG time...i WOULD've walked out but i was WITH someone...i TOLD them we should go to Guardians of the Galaxy 2...but they wanted to see THIS piece of garbage. and it's not as if the acting isn't GREAT! but who CARES? ridiculous plot so that there IS a plot? sorry...didn't fool me...and then all the...well...the ending...puhLEEZE! STILL didn't get me with all the sentimentality and music...and it's not as if i'm beyond feeling emotional in front of a screen...happened many, many times...but i KNOW when i'm being manipulated...no matter HOW good/well done... piece. of. crap. just look at the rating. 7.2 with THAT sort of money behind it and all the depp fans and the geoffrey rush and bardem fans? and it's only a 7.2? that must tell you SOMEthing! should be at LEAST an 8. like ANY upstanding block buster...i.e. guardians of the galaxy...prob rated low...but i bet it's better than a 7.2. and, to tell the truth, it wouldn't matter to me if it WASN'T. b/c i KNOW a good movie from a bad one, no matter the genre, after seeing the 1000s i've seen over the years...piece. of. garbage.",1,6,16,31 May 2017
Uri: The Surgical Strike," predictable, cliched/unimaginative...
","Maybe this passes for an 8.0 rating from people of that region of the world...maybe it has a lot to do with nationalism. but, overall, it would seem that this doesn't belong in the global market. unless you've never seen war films made from MANy other countries...not a complicated relationship in the movie. and the ace up the sleeve ending was just sooooooooo predictable...i watched it all the way through just to see why it might have such a high rating...i guess a large number of people just don't know any better...",5,3,7,22 March 2019
Alice in Wonderland," 2D or NOT 2D?
","flat. in otras palabers, 2D no matter WHERE you see it... some deppth, but no charisma... don't waste your monies on this one...one thing i know will ALWAYS happen in a burton movie...GREAT visuals...if HE's writing the story i DEFinitely won't go pay for it... not the case here but maybe he would've done better...couldn't've done much worse...anyways...i liked the ending...the last few minutes after she was back from Australia... which is, of course, funny...and carroll would approve...b/c MOST stories lack good endings...i'm always tellling people that if they have a really good ending to write a story around it...so, OK...just go see the last 3, maybe 3 and a half minutes...and see if they'll prorate the price...",4,1,4,13 March 2010
Avatar," it was like going to the movies for the first time...and there i was aGAIN, rooting for the Indians...
","not you guys out in India...you know...the kind that helped the white people make it through their first winters in the americas...i remember sitting in the theater when i first saw flying motorcycle scene in 'return of the jedi' and thinking...'wow...this kinda marks a new level of achievement in movie storytelling...pretty much anything that can be thought of can be visually depicted.'haven't even come CLOSE to having that feeling till today watching this movie...when i ducked out of the way of something that seemed to fly off the screen...OK. so the story line's a bit clichéd/derivative...i could cite quite a few stories it reminded me of... but obviously, like so many other commenters have remarked, in the end it didn't matter. it didn't stop me from feeling like i'd just experienced a leap in movie-making history...and don't get me wrong, it wasn't a terrible story...i really liked 'the message' it seemed to want to deliver...so, not that it would seem anyone is looking for the excuse, but i felt i, without any reservation, got my money's worth of entertainment...",Null,0,4,18 December 2009
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2," with this many reviews, i don't think another is necessary, BUT...it deSERVES it...
","i gave it a 10. i don't even usu rate movies...and i CERtainly didn't expect much from THIS one, BUT...it was entertaining from start to finish...and while i expected nothing but adolescent humor, which wasn't going to be funny to me, i was laughing out loud throughout many, many scenes...this movie is good for ANY kind of film...it's SERious entertainment. i see all KINDS of films...saw 'django' just before this one...very good film, btw...but guardians was exTREMEly well thought out and executed...all the right touches in all the right places...if you aren't entertained...and i mean REALly entertained by this movie? check your pulse...i'm actually looking FORward to the next one...",10,3,8,6 May 2017
The Fountain," phew!
","when i started reading the numerous reviews, they were, almost, all positive...so i'm thinking, 'weeeellllllll...maybe it's 'just me'...'then i noticed that i had the order set for best reviews first... ;-)i stopped watching this an hour in. i just couldn't take it anymore... it wasn't boring like some wrote... but the ACTING! i almost never even THINK about the acting(except for the movie 'the dead girl'. WOW!)...to me it's a given...with all the actors to choose from, given a certain budget... but these clowns were making me laugh at 'inappropriate' times... and that's when i knew it was time to stop...i'm sorry. but if a movie can't interest me(and there WERE interesting moments. great visuals. some fascinating references), esPEcially given the slapdash tapestry of a wide spectrum of cultural myths, after an hour... and everyone in the movie kept saying rachel weisz's character was so amazing... why? maybe i'm just too old to let my 'romance buttons' get pushed this easily...but EYE was ready to kill her just to get the movie OVER with, by the time i decided to just stop watching...",1,16,32,19 January 2007
Edge of Tomorrow," seen thousands of movies...
","started in the 50s when my mother would drag me along because she couldn't find anyone to babysit me. so i'd get taken to movies like 'bridge over the river kwai', 'ten commandments', 'ben hur'... i consider myself to be able to hold my own in a conversation about films(from not only America) over the last half century...earlier than that my knowledge is patchy(not to be confused with A-pache, cowboy). i'm telling all this to try and validate my knowledge of storytelling somewhat. i'm with the camp that said they were surprised at how much they enjoyed this movie. those that criticized it(i didn't see a whole lot...but, then again, i only looked at the first page. and there was at least one. i feel the need to negate those negative). sure...i REALly didn't like the ending... but i'm talking the last few minutes. otherwise it was, aside from the initial few minutes of getting us familiar with cruise's character, solidly entertaining. you critics out there...again, i invite you to do better. even just the writing part. obviously you think you can write a good review. so let's see what you REALly got. i already know what 'edge of tomorrow' holds...and despite my really not liking aspects of the film, i wouldn't hesitate recommending it for anyone that's attracted to an action sci fi(more emphasis on the action, but enough sci fi to add extra torque...).",7,0,3,1 June 2014
50_50," i can't believe i'm doing another review to add to the 12 pp already here...
","but i read a few of the ones in the beginning and no one said some of the things i thought or felt, sooooo... it's the most fun I(emphasized) ever had with a cancer movie... and most of the time i felt guilty about feeling that way...which is interesting. i've been on both sides of serious medical, life changing events... as a health professional and in my personal life... and i think that what's MOST attractive about this film to people is that it's a rubbernecker's dream... we get to be a fly on the wall during the course of this person's cancer crisis. and that's a euphemism for a voyeur. we know, whether consciously or not, that WE don't have cancer. and we're being entertained AND scared. and it's STILL? not US! and i don't know HOW...but the whole movie i KNEW he wasn't going to die...it just didn't lend itself to that possibility on some subliminal level. tell me i'm not right... no one in Hollywood is going to lose money on what gets presented in the first 7/8ths because of what happens in the very last part. don't get me wrong. i had a good time with it. but that's my point. it was a bit TOO safe. the characters caricaturish/broad stroke.. but i never felt it went into the unrealistic area...i've seen all sorts of things happen in situations like this. so i wouldn't say there's any predicting specifics. tendencies, yes. specifics, no... so they just roller coastered us through... what a fun ride... ooooooooooh! THAT was scary... wow! THAT was fun... THIS is awkward. but now it's fun again... emotional ping pong well played...and while some people criticized rogen's character as being TOO one dimensional(and an uncaring, walking penis. maybe not QUITE in those words, though), a)you must've grown up somewhere other than a city... b)HIS way of coping was by doing JUST the opposite of dying...it was having sex. it's how LOTS of people attempt to balance out the pain and anxiety in their lives...it wasn't that he didn't CARE... we get to see all this when Joseph's character crash's at rogen's character's place and he finds the book about all doing the cancer together... i could feel the room get warm and fuzzy at that moment... you know the movie 'terms of endearment'?",8,0,1,21 January 2012
Kingsman: The Secret Service," sorry, but...
","i had to dig through lots of the 'overkill'(not just physical violence) to enjoy the movie... if i didn't know any better i'd say they were trying too hard. but i DO know better. they got some people in the seats(the 'respectable' ones who are a bit openminded, at least)with colin firth and michael caine...got the Tarantino crowd into the seats with samuel l. and kept that 'teenage' British boy in the seat with all the over the top stuff. by the time the respectables realized they'd been conned, they were covered in all sorts of blood and innards. after a while i don't even notice the expletives...i'm from b'klyn. my mother spoke that way. in fact, she had a job teaching sailors how to swear. i understand it as emotional punctuation. lots don't. they see it as disrespect. forest? meet tree... while i'm on the subject...people...when are you going to realize that words are just sounds. it's the inTENT that's important. and studies have shown that verbal language comprises 7% of communication. seven precent. kinda the definition of 'tunnel vision', wouldn't you think? so some person at the studio who kinda handicapped the demographics deserves, at least, a pat on the back... i imagine the profits of this movie will justify their method/s. don't get me wrong. there were parts/elements of this film that i enjoyed. but, overall, it was a case for me of less is more.",Null,1,5,15 February 2015
