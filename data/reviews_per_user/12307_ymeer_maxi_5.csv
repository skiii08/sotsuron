The Avengers," Avengers Finally Assembled!
","I have seen 'The Avengers' twice now. I really wanted to like the movie and after seeing it for the first time, I didn't quite like it, so I gave the movie a second chance to absorb myself more and found out that my first Judgement about the movie was quite right.The Avengers has some awesome special effects (just like every other movie these days Transformers, Battleship, Darkshadows etc). There are a few scenes in particular that I liked in the movie :- + Black Widow's introduction was quite amazing + The Fight scene in the S.H.I.E.L.D Carrier was intense and amazing + The Final Fight Scene is truly breathtaking and heartwarming too (psstt you know what the Iron Man does) Almost the rest of it was quite Formulic, bad guy tries to take over the world, brings the army, Avengers are assembled and huge intense action scenes.I really wanted the characters to interact with each other more and get to know about each others strength and weaknesses. I also would have loved an intense plot with maybe a twist to surprise us in some way. I am really hoping that they take the criticism of the movie made by the fans at heart and improve on everything what they did here.I still have high hopes for The Avengers in there next movie and I am really hoping that I would get to give it at least an 8 or a 9 the next time around.P.S I saw the deleted scenes of the movie, they all fitted quite well and added more to the story, don't know why they decided to take it out.",6,3,9,25 September 2012
Source Code," A nice sci-fi thriller
","Source is a futuristic thriller, although it may bear its similarities with the Minority Report movie, though it is nothing like it. It's a very creative movie that starts a bit slow but picks it pace later on in the movie and the ride only gets more enjoyful from that point on.Captain Colter Stevens is a solider that finds himself being trapped into a cube shaped device, which people refer to as the 'Source Code', the easiest way to understand the 'Source Code' is, it's a device created for the good of man kind, that lets you travel into a parallel universe and lets you see things and determine its outcome, for instance in the movie Captain Colter finds himself in a train that is about to blow up in about 8 minutes, what he has to do in those 8 minutes is to search for the bomb, track down who might have put it and search everyone through the train and has infinite amount of tries to find that out.Telling you more about the story would be giving too much away from the plot that serves as a thrill of its own and a twist in the end itself. It's a very enjoyful ride if you can get past the story driven the first 30 minutes of the movie. It's a must check out for the sci-fi fans and futuristic thrillers, if you liked the movies like Inception, Minority Report & Sunshine than this movie must be right up your ally to watch.I would give it a 7 stars out of 10. Thanks for reading the review.",Null,0,2,7 August 2011
Captain Marvel," Very generic Marvel movie!!!
","It seems to me like, Marvel has got the perfect formula that draws the audience, give the audience just enough not to feel bored.The CGI is good, the character Nick Fury (played by Samuel L. Jackson) is portrayed pretty good, the fight scenes are very generic, with some sparks here and there.It does just enough to make you entertained and pass the mark of the 2 hour movie, but I personally think that the characters weren't developed good, it basically felt like a 2 part cartoon with all its fights and generic character development.I did not feel like Brie Larson was Captain Marvel, maybe it was the script? I understand not all the movies have to be dark like (The Dark Knight trilogy), but there has to be something there that makes you connect with the characters more.The movie (of course) has been a big success, so here's to hope that Captain Marvel 2 would address the problems this movie had. All in all a fair movie, it's just about right, nothing more, nothing less, but I think Marvel movies need to change their formula a bit, because otherwise it's going to become stale pretty fast.",6,0,4,14 November 2019
Ice Age: Continental Drift," Great animation, cute characters, charming....needs to push itself further!
","This is the fourth installment of the Ice Age series. The first made a huge impact, it's heart warming story and characters won millions of hearts. Then came the Ice Age: The Meltdown, which to be quite honest I didn't enjoy that much, then came the third Ice Age : Dawn Of The Dinosaurs which I really enjoyed since it added new characters and I liked the new environment instead of always staying on 'Ice' like the first two movies, it was a welcome change. Now we have the fourth movie in the series Ice Age: Continental Drift which retreats back to the first two movies, which by this point is 'been there, seen that' scenario.By now you might have noticed that where do I think Ice Age's downfall is. The Story itself is pretty straight forward and the same scenario / story was already told in Ice Age 2: The Meltdown. Don't know why they decided to do it again instead of adding something new? The characters remain the same as we remember, cute and lovable. The animation looks extremely well done this time around.By no means is Ice Age : Continental Drift a terrible movie. Is it entertaining? Yes. Does it have a cast of cute characters? Yes. Is the story good? Yes, good enough to keep your attention, but by the end of the day you will realize that it's fairly similar to the first two movies which you have seen before. If there is going to be a fifth installment in the series, they really need to breath new life in the series in order to prevent it from becoming just another pretty looking all style and no substance animation movie.",6,1,1,29 September 2012
Dark Shadows," Entertains, but nothing memorable here
","Dark Shadows follows the tale of Barnabas Collins, a wealthy and a rich man who whose family migrates from Liverpool in the 1760's and start a fishing business in America , which turns out to be more than successful and is called Colllinsport. Collins seduces one of the housemaids, who loves him very dearly, but finds out that the Barnabas does not love him back. Barnabas falls in love and marries to which the house maid feels heartbroken and jealous to and places a cruse on Collins family who die under mysterious circumstances and ends up wiping out most of Barnabas ancestors, but most of all places a curse on Barnabas himself, who himself jumps off the cliff in order to be with his dead wife who not a few moments ago jumped off the cliff under the spell of the house maid, the witch Angelique Bouchard, Barnabas finds himself surviving the fall only to find out that he's been turned into a Vampire by the witch. Towns people are turned against Barnabas as he kills people for blood, they arrest him, chain him and then bury him inside the coffin....Alive.200 years later or should I say 196 (As said by the antagonist of the movie) the coffin is opened and the things are about to change for the better ...or the worse.The story is rather very simple and not that complicated to understand. It gives you a sense on what to expect at the very start of the movie. Dark Shadows falls under the category of Dark Horror Comedy, Tim Burton (the director of the movie who needs no introduction) directs that movie quite well. He's no stranger to dark tone of the movies, his shining example would be 'Sweeney Todd : The Demon Barber Of Fleet Street' that was released in 2007. Johnny Depp once again returns along Tim Burtons side, to me personally this actor can portray many roles with ease, he can be a Demon Barber, Captain Jack Sparrow, Mad Hatter ........a Vampire and countless other roles he was played over the years. In short he was perfect for that role.This movie is well directed, the sets are amazing, the performances are top notch. The visuals look amazing, despite of having everything perfect, I think the script needed a bit more work on it to make it more memorable and developing other characters more. Despite that minor shortcoming aside, I certainly enjoyed watching the movie 'Dark Shadows'. I won't be seeing it again & again,. But it's a pretty pleasant ride that should be experienced at least 'once'.",6,0,1,22 September 2012
