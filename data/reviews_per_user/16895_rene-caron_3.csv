Ford v Ferrari," This movie knows what it is and doesn't stray
",Great popcorn movie that you'd have to be dead to not enjoy. It is a bit on the long side. I think they stretched it out to give their characters depth.,9,3,5,24 January 2020
Inglourious Basterds," Yakkety Yak Yak Yak
","I saw the trailer and thought this movie would be fun. I knew I was in trouble at the opening scene where the visiting Nazi has a long chat with the farmer. I'd say 90% of this movie is long irrelevant chats in restaurants and other rooms. I mean who cares? This was advertised as a fun action-packed war movie about crazy guys that kill Nazis. Instead you get a snooze fest. Every now and then I'd think 'OK now we're going to get to the good stuff. He's been torturing us so we'll really enjoy the good stuff'. But you know what? There was no good stuff. Sure there was a few war porn moments, but nothing that got me really engaged in the flick.Gratuitous violence is part of a Tarantino movie experience. So I was not surprised to see it. But somehow it just seemed adolescent. It added nothing to the story. The military does have a command structure and they don't let their soldiers carve people up like a Thanksgiving goose for fun. This was the 2nd World War where the Allies were actually good guys.I must admit after seeing numerous Hitler parodies on YouTube I'm rather spoiled. Every actor that plays Hitler must measure up to the YouTube parody version. This one does not. And the ending - f'ing retarded. Like a frustrated cinema owner could bring down the entire Third Reich. The thing is so full of holes you'd think the Nazis were complete amateurs that couldn't guard an outhouse.",4,14,26,28 May 2010
"Sal√≤, or the 120 Days of Sodom"," The warning that never disappears
","This film got me thinking about evolution and how it always ends up favoring monsters. After all, human monsters kill all the good guys and then go on to have children. Read the Bible. Jews massacre race after race and keep all the virgins to breed with. What do you get? Us! (Nothing against Jews, its just that that Bible is familiar). This film reaches down into your gut and forces you to confront some terrible realities. We all know war criminals with cushy jobs at Universities (Rumsfield). We all watch the news and Internet to see what bad soldiers do with their free time. Religions are forever torturing and murdering women to appease or rationalize some primitive urge. Right wing bigots tear up the airwaves urging people to hate gays, immigrants and anyone with a sense of fairness. We are outraged when foreigners celebrate the murder of our soldiers but we congratulate ourselves for bombing entire countries back to the stone age. The 120 Days of Sodom is all around us all the time. It takes a film like this to force us to see it. The film makes an excellent point of what lurks underneath power. If you watch this film and then go back to your life with the blinders on - well I guess that is the point of the whole film. If the film didn't reach you, you are the unseen force in the film and gives license to the evil perverts shown therein. This film is a terrible but highly accurate vision of the dilemma we are born into. If you don't see yourself or our society in the monsters of this film I think you missed the point.",8,3,6,24 September 2010
