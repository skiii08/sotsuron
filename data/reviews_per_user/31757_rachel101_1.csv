Catch Me If You Can," dissapointed
","i watched this film tonight and was dissapointed with it! i thought that it could of been much better. I think that it was also too long for 15 year old teenagers to sit, after a while it looses the viwers intrests. (IM so SORRY leo ) i dont have any complaints about the story line or the acting i think it was top horn!!!!",8,1,2,27 February 2003
