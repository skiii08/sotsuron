Howl's Moving Castle," So damn cute.
","Like i said, 'It is so damn cute.' 10/10 Cute storyline. Cute castle. Cute little fireball. Somewhat cute old women. cute little kiss at the end. Cute colors. mean magic, and CUTE magic. pretty painting's that are cute. Sophie's cute. The whole movie is filled to the the max on cuteness, even the scary moments are cute, the way the characters smile......cute, the little dog that runs funny; is both very cute and funny. A matter of fact the movie is so cute that you just might be compelled to right a review explaining how cute the damn thing is. I love cute movies. The only movies that are cuter: wizard of oz, and the godfather- I think Italian people are just funny and cute.",10,3,5,21 September 2005
