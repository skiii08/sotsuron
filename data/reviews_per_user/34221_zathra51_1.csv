Requiem for a Dream," Amazing
","I watched it once, took me a long time to be able to watch it again. I can surely say that I've never seen a movie that has had such an impact on me as this one. After I had finished watching it the first time, I felt like..can't really describe it.. I didn't know if I was going to start crying och puking.. It was all overwhelming.. The passion of Christ is like watching Friends compared to this one.I find each of the actors performances amazing. Sadly I lack the vocabulary to describe why.. To me this movie was about how every individuals choice affects the people around him/her. The story of a good life and a perfect love.. going down the drain.. just trying to hang on. It's an terrible story, a life that I wouldn't even wish my worst enemy. The camera angles and the close-ups makes you even more freaked out.I can find only one reason to why this film didn't get an Oscar, and that's because the jury didn't have the guts to watch it. If you see only one movie in your life, this is the one to watch.",10,0,1,28 October 2004
