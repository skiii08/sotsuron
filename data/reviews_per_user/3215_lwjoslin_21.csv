The Rock," Rockin'
","Slam-bang high-tech action-thriller stuff.  Ed Harris, as a much-decorated combat commander of legendary status, deploys a hand-picked squadron of elite renegade Marines to take over Alcatraz. He holds hostage not only a civilian tour group, but the entire city of San Fran, at which he's aimed 15 tactical missiles armed with the nastiest nerve gas in the universe. His goal?  To get the US government to acknowledge, with posthumous honors and compensation to family members, about 100 men lost -- and unacknowledged -- in covert operations ranging from Vietnam to Desert Storm.Here come the Feds: they send in a team of SEALs led by Michael Biehn (in a reprise, basically, of his role in 'Aliens'). Their ringers: Nicolas Cage, in a rather John Cusackish performance as a lab-wonk toxic-weapons expert, hilariously short of combat experience; and Sean Connery, as a long-held secret prisoner of the US, a Brit agent who has all the dirt on the FBI.  He knows all the secrets from Roswell (!) to the JFK assassination, and he's the only man ever to escape from Alcatraz. The scripter's inclusion of the presence in San Fran of people who are near and dear to both these characters is more than a little contrived.  It has MOTIVATION written all over it in the case of Connery's character, and UP THE ANTE in the case of Cage's. But what the hell: this isn't drama, but melodrama, essentially an hyperbolic mismatched-buddy-cop movie, and the pace, the action, and the stars' charisma are equal to it.  An enjoyable cliffhanger, if wildly improbable.",6,2,3,23 September 2003
The Blair Witch Project," Fear itself
","'The Blair Witch Project' is a horror movie about fear itself.  Since fear is subjective, the movie is like a Rorschach ink-blot test: you'll either see something there or you won't.  My brother and I disagreed as to whether it was boring or terrifying.  We were both right: it bored him, and it terrified me.In the late '50's, Robert Bloch, in an essay titled 'The Clown at Midnite' [sic], generally lamenting the state of horror movies at the time, posed the rhetorical question, 'What is a horror movie?'  It is, he said, a movie whose content horrifies.  Obvious, perhaps; but nonetheless, he said, studios had forgotten how to make them, opting instead for monster movies, sci-fi movies, big-bug movies, and mad-doctor movies, full of shock and 'gore' moments (moments only, in those days), freighted with 'comic relief,' saddled with the obligatory romantic subplot, and replete with 'latex false faces that wouldn't frighten a two-year-old.'  He concluded that there simply was no such thing any more as a movie made just to scare the hell out of you.Since then, there have been a few.  'The Haunting' (the 1963 original, not the execrable 1999 remake) was one; so was the (original) 'Night of the Living Dead' and the (original) 'Texas Chainsaw Massacre.'  Three very different flicks, but all very frightening, and -- considering the red-meat subject matter of the last two -- quite restrained.  NOTLD and TCM were also low-budget indies, which added to their gritty credibility.Into the pantheon of low-budget/no-budget horror now goes 'The Blair Witch Project,' a product of the thriving film industry of Maryland (which gave us the oeuvre of John Waters).  Minimalism at its minimal-est, BWP (these low-budget creepers always have 'mouthful' titles best reduced to initials) is presented as a pseudo-documentary.  The premise is that, in October 1994, three student filmmakers set out into the Maryland woods to shoot a documentary about a local legend, the malefic Blair Witch, a Colonial-era miscreant said to haunt the woods still.  (One is reminded of the Jersey Devil, the subject of a similar, slightly earlier, and even LOWER-budgeted movie, 'The Last Broadcast.')  The three kids were never seen again, but a year later, their footage was found.  And that is what we watch.Heather, Josh and Mike (the names of the actors as well as the characters) set out on this weekend camping trip as a lark.  But the fun dries up when they promptly get lost, and as the days drag on, are cold, hungry, tired, panic-stricken, getting on each other's nerves -- and stalked by an unseen presence.  As in, say, 'Rear Window,' we the viewers are trapped along with the protagonists; as in, say, NOTLD, they start turning on each other.  And they learn too late that you can be young, hip, smart, and middle-class, living in a world of computers and fast food, and still --  when you're lost in a patch of woods you wouldn't have thought big enough to get lost in, in a part of the country long settled and urbanized, and just a few miles from DC -- find yourself prey to primal fears, mostly of the dark.  This is, as I said, an essay about fear itself.  No masked madman with a chainsaw is after these kids, no plague of flesh-eating zombies, no ghost -- maybe not even a witch.  But SOMETHING is out there; the kids aren't just scaring themselves, as it becomes agonizingly clear.Shot in color video and B&W 16mm film (the two cameras the kids lug with them), BWP is a technical oxymoron: credibly spontaneous (much of it was, in fact, ad-libbed), yet beautifully and effectively edited.  The one false note comes early on: one of the locals, an eccentric woman whom claims to have seen the witch, totes a huge Bible and wears a rosary (incorrectly) as a necklace.  She might as well wear a sign that says 'Religious Nutcase.' Pity she was rendered so stereotypically: in movies of this sort, with ill-advised questers heading into dangerous ground, there's usually a disreputable-looking eccentric warning them not to go.  So while this character belonged here and her eccentricity is a given, it's too bad that, in a flick of otherwise great verisimilitude, her phony props distract from her acceptable performance.The image that will long linger in mind comes near the film's end: Heather, taping herself in such closeup that we see her only from the nose up, whispers a panicky, tearful farewell and apology to her parents and those of her crewmates.  'I'm scared to close my eyes...  I'm scared to open them... We're gonna die out here...'  Brrr!  Fear itself.",9,1,3,24 July 2002
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," why have I not been in a hurry to see it a second time?
","A few observations about 'SWE1:TPM':1) The first 45 minutes or so had me restless: lots of talky backstory, much of it political!  Fortunately, the pace picked up as the flick progressed.2) The highly-touted pod race, while enjoyable, actually suffers in comparison to the hovercycle chase through the woods in 'Jedi.'3) What a clothes horse Queen Amidala is!  Different outfit, AND a radically different 'do, in every scene.  It's almost as if her look changes every time she walks into another room.  And how is it that Jedi Qui-Gon Jin, master of all things forceful, is unable to recognize the 'disguised' Amidala just because she's changed into her handmaid's duds?  Are we to believe that washing the Kabuki off her face makes her the Invisible Girl? Was there a twinkle in Qui-Gon's eye to indicate he wasn't buying this? Why have I never been interested enough to see the movie a second time and find out?4) The humor is cutesy and self-conscious, but that's typical 'Star Wars.'5) I'm puzzled by the revelation that 3PO was built by Anakin.  The kid refers to him as a 'protocol droid,' as though to a known class or model of droid; and indeed, we've already seen a (female-voiced) similar droid serving the drinks on Naboo.  So evidently the kid hasn't built him from scratch, but from scrap--or from a kit--the way a real-world whiz-kid would build, but not invent, a Chevy.  (He must've found the software, too, since we learn, in the 'later' episodes, that 3PO speaks 6 million languages. That's a bit much for a kid so young, Force or no Force.)6) A total waste of Samuel L. Jackson.  I understand we see more of Mace Windu in SWE2.7) When the story finally gets to the thick of things, I like the way we had the good guys in serious trouble on four fronts--the battle between the Gungans and the droids; the attack on the control ship; the attempt to capture the Viceroy in charge of the invasion; and the fight with Darth Maul--only to have a sudden, simultaneous reversal take place.  I'd been afraid we were in for a cliffhanger.8) Still, it occurred to me as I watched the attack on the control ship: this was fresh in 1977; it's been done to death since then, in the 'Star Wars' series and its imitators.  I liked 'Starship Troopers' better than this.9) Darth Maul, while kinetic and dangerous (the swordplay choreography is VASTLY improved since '77), is otherwise underwritten: not a villain, but a thug; not so much evil as just p*ssed-off.  He lacks the towering, calm, confident presence of Darth Vader, who stole the first movie just by showing up.  Maul apparently isn't even considered by Lucas to be a character worth keeping in the series, unless we're in for a real medical miracle (I haven't seen SWE2 yet, so I don't know if he resurfaces).  And I've never cared for his silly greasepaint job, which looks like an attempt at a computerized Maori tattoo, made worse by those cheesy glued-on horns.
10) And what can you say about Jake Lloyd as Boy Vader, other than: CAN'T ACT!!!  He doesn't ruin the whole movie... just those scenes in which he opens his mouth.  It looks like Lucas, up to his armpits in CGI and ILM work, picked up his daily planner and penciled in a 20-minute slot on Thursday afternoon labeled: 'Hire kid.' I disliked 'Mannequin' Skywalker FAR worse than I disliked... you-know-who.",6,1,3,29 May 2002
Se7en," Unlucky number
","'Se7en' was the serial killer movie of the week at the time of its release. Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt--apparently representing Reason and Passion, respectively--are cops on the trail of a serial killer. Kevin Spacey plays the killer as a Hannibal Lecter wannabe with a vengeful-angry-God complex: he bumps his victims off in ways that reflect the Seven Deadly Sins.  Not a new idea; Vincent Price made two similarly-constructed movies in the '70s: 'The Abominable Dr. Phibes,' in which the inspiration is the ten curses of Pharaoh in the book of Exodus; and 'Theater of Blood,' in which Shakespeare's plays provide the motifs.  ('Se7en' makes a nod in the direction of its predecessors by mentioning the 'pound of flesh' associated with one of the murders.)  The difference is that the Price movies were jet-black comedies, while 'Se7en' is a straightforward suspense thriller, and a relentlessly grim, gray, dark, rain-soaked one at that.  It's technically well-made and unusually literate, drawing themes from Dante, Milton, Shakespeare, and medieval theology.  And there's a strong echo of Dostoevsky's 'Notes from the Underground': when the killer's lair is located, it's found to contain 2000 handwritten notebook journals of 250 pages each.  (Quibbles: if he writes that much, when does he find time to do anything else... such as plan and execute fiendishly clever crimes?  Also, we're told that none of the journals or entries are dated.  As one who has kept a daily journal for ten years, I find that unlikely, especially since the killer is ultimately revealed to be even more, shall we say, detail-oriented than I am.)The movie's ending (which I won't reveal here) is distressingly downbeat--and surprisingly so, as well.  It leaves a nasty aftertaste.  It could be argued that anything less would've been a cop-out, but it still was about as entertaining as a sucker punch.  'The Silence of the Lambs' left us with Lecter on the loose, but at least there was salvation (the girl was rescued), redemption (the lambs were silenced), and retribution (the killer was dispatched without the incidental destruction of anyone else).  By contrast, 'Se7en,' which offers none of the above, is easy to admire, but hard to enjoy.",7,3,5,16 May 2003
Unbreakable," unbearable
","M. Night Shyamalan directs this one as though he's in a trance; it would have to be sped up a notch or two in order to be called 'slow.'  Weirdly inappropriate tone: as David Dunn (Bruce Willis) discovers things about himself that are unexplainable and frankly wonderful, the mood of the flick is gloomy, as though he's undergoing an 'Angel Heart'-like descent.  This despite the fact that the good-news aspect of the story could be occasion for joy without being reduced to a trivial 'superhero' handling of the type the director was too-obviously trying to avoid.  Interesting if uncompelling ideas and good performances, including a most unusual turn by Samuel L. Jackson; but murky, glum, and glacially paced.",Null,0,1,27 August 2001
Underworld," Underwhelmed
","Despite its vampire-'n'-werewolf content, 'Underworld' isn't a horror movie, but an action/terror movie.  Almost nonstop gun battles between the hunters (vampires) and the hunted (werewolves), who are about to turn the tables with a bit of insider help.  For semi-coherent reasons, a young male human becomes a pawn in the war between bloodsuckers and shapeshifters.As usual, almost nothing crosses over to the screen from actual folklore. Folkloric vampires are NOT destroyed or harmed by sunlight -- not literally much of an issue here, since almost the whole story takes place at night, though the werewolves have managed to get their paws on some ammo that fires an ultraviolet charge ('liquid sunlight').  Folkloric lycanthropy is NOT contagious by the bite.  Folkloric vampires and werewolves are NOT social creatures who form 'covens' or travel in packs.  And the very premise of an ethnic war between vampires and werewolves is inauthentic.  The two 'species' are NOT anything like now-and-forever separate: in certain folklores, werewolves BECOME vampires after death, and vampires can transform into wolves.All that having been said, what works? Good atmosphere: lots of darkness, rain, and subterranean locations.  Good art design, ranging from the sets and locations to the props, weapons, and costumes.  Good action and FX, and the pace generally keeps moving.  Good cast, though none of them seem to be enjoying themselves.What doesn't work?  It's all very grim and solemn, and not very much fun. Kate Beckinsdale as Selene (basically Buffy the Werewolf Slayer) is admirably intense, focused, loyal, and fearless: like everybody else in the movie, she's formidable, but not likeable.  We have nobody to root for: there are so many double-crosses and betrayals -- and, during the gun battles, both sides, clad in black, look so much alike -- that it's hard to ward off confusion after awhile, not to mention apathy.
A good dose of clever dark humor would have helped this movie a lot.  But ultimately, all the characters take themselves SO seriously that it's like being a captive audience at a Goth party.  This is how the Goths of my acquaintance view themselves -- sleek, sexy, and dangerous -- instead of as the chubby, pasty losers they are.",Null,0,1,14 October 2003
12 Monkeys," Don't let the title fool you... it's not about a jury of Jerry Springer audience members
","Much as I like Terry Gilliam, '12 Monkeys' disappoints.  It's familiar, belabored, too slow, and too long.  The meaning of the mysterious airport flashback becomes obvious miles in advance, and when I look back on the movie, all I get is talk, talk, talk, accompanied by very little of Gilliam's trademark visual bravado.  A good cast tries gamely, and the soundtrack music is good and quite memorable as well.  But '12 Monkeys' mainly just made me curious to see 'La Jettee,' the 1963 French short that inspired it.",6,0,4,27 March 2003
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Christopher Lee rules!
","'SWE2' crams a lot into its ample running time: great spectacle, dazzling action, sometimes confusing politics, several starchy characters, and often stilted dialogue (young lovers DO NOT use the word 'cannot' in conversation!).  Unfortunately, the Boy Who Couldn't Act in 'SWE1' (Boy Vader was by far the weakest link, much more so than you-sa know who) has grown up to be the Young Man Who Still Can't Act.  At this rate, we may run full circle, to the 1977 original, before we get to a guy (2 guys, actually: Dave Prowse's walk and James Earl Jones' voice) who can play Anakin/Vader effectively.Though Hayden Christensen isn't equal to the task, it's interesting to see the path by which Anakin is being tempted to the 'dark side.'  It's not like he's tempted to rob a convenience store or become a bodyguard to a drug lord.  Who doesn't face the adolescent urge to resist the guidance of fathers or father figures (in this case, Obi-Wan)?  Who doesn't enjoy the flattery and praise of men of influence (Palpatine)? Who wouldn't want to avenge the harm suffered by his own mother?  Most of all, who wouldn't find his steely resolve weakened by the dishy likes of Natalie Portman's Amidala?And poor chump, what an assignment:  'Guard this girl, on whom you already have a tremendous crush, with your life.  Spend time with her at a beautiful lakeside villa surrounded by lush landscapes and glowing sunsets.  Picnic in the tall flowers with her while she runs around wearing flowing Renaissance/hippychick outfits.  But don't you DARE fall in love with her.' Wasn't there ANYBODY ELSE in the galaxy who could have taken this task off his hands?  A gay Jedi, maybe?What mystifies is what she sees in HIM.  Amidala is gorgeous and radiates intelligence, and when the heat is on and the shooting starts, she becomes an action heroine worthy of being Princess Leia's mom.  He, by contrast, remains as lively as a wooden Indian on roller skates, especially in the awkward love scenes between them.  So when she finally declares herself to him, one wonders what she sees in this slab of Canadian bacon, eh?  But no biggie; it's an action flick, a comic-book movie, of the sort in which scenes of emotional resonance often show a tin ear for dialogue.
'SWE2' is otherwise a slam-bam entertainment full of the chases, battles, spectacles, and perilous asteroid belts we've come to expect of the series. The comic interaction between 3PO and R2D2, such a staple since 1977, kicks off here.  It's amusing to see the extent to which Ewan MacGregor is deliberately aping Alec Guiness's mannerisms.  Good to see an expanded role for Samuel L. Jackson as Mace Windu, a hoot to see Yoda in combat (possible now that he's a CGI and no longer a puppet with somebody's hand up his butt), and always great to see Christopher Lee again!  If his character, Count Dooku, is to return in 'SWE3,' they better start filming his scenes soon:  Mr. Lee, the last survivor of the stable of Hammer Films' Gothic regulars, turned 80 in April '02.The political context of the story made me raise my eyebrows.  Some have tried to see a parallel with our current war on terror, but I think they're all wet.  The crisis facing the Republic is that there are separatists who want to break off from the central galactic government.  To counter this popular movement, the Republic's leader, Chancellor Palpatine, 'reluctantly' calls for the creation of a 'Grand Army of the Republic' (!).  People, this isn't the language of 2002, but of 1860: for 'separatists,' substitute 'secessionists,' and you may catch my drift.  Palpatine is the galactic equivalent of the wildly overrated Abe Lincoln, a bloody-handed tyrant who, under the guise of 'preserving the Union,' is instead about to destroy it, to replace the Union of cooperation with a Union of conquest... an Empire, in other words.  The older I get, the more of a Dixieland partisan I become, so I found the cosmopolitical background eerily heartwarming.  And the next galactic rebel I see better be waving the Dixie flag.",Null,0,1,4 June 2002
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," Rock'em sock'em robots
","'Terminator 3' is a worthy successor because it continues the series in exactly the same way that, say, 'Alien3' did not.  Whereas 'A3' basically said 'forget those earlier two movies' and did something disastrously different, 'T3' follows through on situations set up in the first two installations, neither contradicting anything we were told earlier, nor pulling any crucial but previously unknown info out of a hat.  (Think 'Halloween II': 'Gee, we forgot to tell you that Laurie Strode is Michael Myers' sister.'  Never have bought that.  None of that nonsense here.)  'T3' sets up familiar scenes--e.g., Arnold arrives naked from the future and has to find some clothes--then plays against expectations, often humorously, to resolve them.Linda Hamilton's Sarah Connor is absent, but still has her own contribution to make. 'T1' was about Sarah; 'T2' was about Sarah and her son John; 'T3' is about reluctant hero John.  But since the tuff-heroine aspect is so important to this series, that baton is passed to former teenager Claire Danes, who's surprisingly capable as a pi$$ed-off action chick.
Arnold's Terminator--hostile in 'T1', helpful in 'T2'--is still helpful here, if a bit chattier.  His matter-of-fact transmission of useful info, and his timely observations of human nature as he's been programmed to understand it ('Anger is more useful than despair'), make use of Arnold's gift of deadpan comedy.  And the terminatrix, the TX, played by 23-year-old Kristanna Loken, is an absolute icepick.  Combining the deadliest aspects of the earlier models' hardened skeleton AND liquid-metal body, this one adds built-in weapons systems and the ability to remote-control other machines. Loken has only two facial expressions here: a total blank, and a go-to-hell version of a Mona Lisa smirk.  Both expressions are chillingly unblinking. Brrr!Ignore the whiners who are going on about how bad a movie they think this is; they're the equivalent of Comic Book Guy on 'The Simpsons' saying, 'Worst episode EVER!'  Killer robots, nuclear peril, over-the-top vehicle chases, and a two-fisted action heroine: what more could you ask? Surprisingly downbeat ending, all but guaranteeing a 'T4.'  Bring it on.",Null,0,1,4 July 2003
Independence Day," 1776 meets 1957
","ID4 is 'Earth vs. the Flying Saucers' with a budget.  But it also owes a great deal to any number of other, earlier alien-peril/sky-fi flicks. Most obvious among these is 'The War of the Worlds,' including the unsuccessful use of the Bomb and the ultimate demise of the invaders by means of a virus (albeit a computer virus this time).  'ID4' also borrows from the 'Star Wars' saga, mainly the massive dogfight battles and an against-all-odds, intrusive attack on the Death Star-esque mothership.  Despite the spectacle of the destruction of entire cities, the movie is tremendously upbeat.  Ironically (since director/co-writer Roland Emmerich is from Germany), 'ID4' celebrates a lot of traditional American values: bravery, heroism, self-sacrifice, helping one another in the face of disaster, resourcefulness, love, loyalty, faith, the Bomb and the reluctance to use it, marriage, family--and ham radio.  Emmerich also showed a similar grasp of basic Americana in 'The Patriot,' though his remake of 'Godzilla' is about as non-Japanese as could be imagined.  Predictably, a great many critics sneered at the movie for its embrace of such 'old-fashioned' values.  They preferred that summer's 'other' alien-invasion flick, 'The Arrival.'  See my comments about that turkey for my take on why that was the case.",8,0,2,15 August 2003
28 Days Later...," Zombies? What zombies?
","'28 Days Later' is a gritty, low-budget UK suspense/actioner, well acted and sharply edited, but not really a 'zombie' movie, as its ads claim.  More of an apocalyptic plague movie, similar to David Cronenberg's 'Rabid'; the 'zombies' (referred to collectively as the 'infected') are, in fact, living people afflicted with a virulent and incurable contagion that causes instant, murderous rage.  (Shades also of 'Last Man on Earth,' 'The Omega Man,' and--with its small band of military holed up in a compound--'Day of the Dead,' which IS a zombie flick.)  Strange to say, the infected travel in packs, which means they never seem to attack each other.  Wonder why not?  In any case, the only name we're given for their disease is 'rage.'  It's been isolated in a lab and provided with a viral vector: all Hyde, no Jekyll, and no turning back.  One character in the movie suggests that there's nothing particularly wrong with the 'infected' that we haven't seen before; it's just the darker aspects of human nature in concentrated form.Tellingly, the Brits have to defend themselves with such improvised weapons as baseball bats and machetes, thanks to the UK's totalitarian anti-gun laws.  Remember the scene in 'Dawn of the Dead' wherein American 'rednecks' mount a heavily-armed hunting posse, gunning for zombies?  Nothing like that here.  Only Her Majesty's military have firearms.  And in keeping with Machiavelli's observation that there can be no proper relationship between one who's armed and one who's not, they naturally become part of the problem.  It's July 4th as I write this.  Hang onto your guns, America.  They're the best tools for quickly ironing out the wrinklier problems human nature may present.",Null,0,1,4 July 2003
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," True story, I swear...
","A couple of years ago I was dating a girl from Shanghai.  We'd tentatively agreed to see this movie together, but we amicably parted ways shortly before it came out, so we ended up seeing it separately.  When we compared notes afterward, she said, 'You know dat not really happen, right?'  (I'm not making fun of her accent, by the way, or exaggerating it.  This is how she talked.)  I said of course I knew it wasn't true... I mean, people running up walls, walking on water, flying through the air, and whatnot...

Moulin Rouge!," We'll always have the Green Fairy
","Obviously, this movie has its audience, though I'm not among them.  I had to watch the DVD in increments, since it made me restless and impatient. 'Moulin Rouge' is well cast and handsomely produced, but its thinly-plotted tale of star-crossed lovers serves only as a framework on which to hang an endless succession of musical numbers, many of which simply don't work, or go on too long, or both.  Set in 1900 Paris, the movie makes use of pop songs and show tunes that are well out of period, ranging from 'Lady Marmalade' to 'Roxanne' to 'Like a Virgin' (the occasion for an embarrassingly forced and awkward dance number) to 'Your Song,' to name just a very few.  I've liked 'Your Song' for 30 years, but if one more character, one more time, had said, 'It's a little bit funny, this feeling inside,' I'd have hit the STOP button once and for all.  One moment, and one moment only, in 'Moulin Rouge' works the intended magic on me: the Green Fairy, a wicked Tinkerbell, springs to hallucinatory life from the label on a bottle of absinthe, trailing a shower of green sparks.  The scene (which comes in the movie's first ten minutes, more's the pity) is less than a minute long, but manages to feature overlapping musical quotes from 'The Hills are Alive,' 'Children of the Revolution,' and the theme song from the movie 'The Boy with Green Hair' (the song about the 'very strange enchanted boy').  I watched that scene about 50 times before finally returning the DVD to the video store.  More of her fairy dust and this movie might have worked better.  All told, though, 'Moulin Rouge' is frustrating, irritating, and hyperactive.  As the French say, chacun a son gout.",Null,0,2,9 May 2002
Mulholland Drive," silencio
","If 'Mulholland Dr.' is any indication, David Lynch is still in the same bizarre nightmare mode of 'Lost Highway,' and employing the same theme of dissociated personal identity--which is to say, the same gimmick of having one or more characters suddenly turn into someone else halfway through the story.  Shades of Polanski's 'The Tenant,' too, with its prospect of having the same nightmare tragedy play out again and again, like an endless tape loop.  The ending sort of irritated me at first, but the movie is improving in memory as some of the pieces fall into place (I think!).  The convoluted story makes any sense at all ONLY if at least 2 or 3 or 4 of the peripheral characters are not, as they seem, gangsters interfering with the casting of a movie, but literally demons, interfering with the 'casting' of lives. That... or maybe the lead character is insane.  In either case, expect to do some head-scratching.  And drop me a line if you figure it out.",Null,0,1,9 May 2002
From Dusk Till Dawn," From dusk till yawn
","'From Dusk Till Dawn' works as a thrill ride; if it were a rollercoaster, it'd be named the 'Vomit Comet.'  It also serves as a showcase for what was, at the time, the state of the art in makeup/splatter/morphing effects.  It falls short in most other respects.For one thing, its structure makes it almost two separate movies: before the Gecko brothers arrive at the Mexican bar, it's another Tarantino crime-spree road picture a la 'Natural Born Killers'; afterwards, it's 'Vamp' meets 'Dawn of the Dead.'  Quentin Tarantino, who stars, opposite George Clooney, as the more unstable of the two criminal brothers, also scripted; evidently, he knows how to write action movies, but less about how to write vampire movies.  (Let alone horror movies, which are much more subtle than terror/action flicks.)As with all of Tarantino's works, this one is highly derivative.  In addition to 'Vamp' (vampire strippers) and 'Dawn of the Dead' (bikers vs. the undead, even going so far as to cast Tom Savini as one of the bikers!), FDTD features squirt guns full of holy water a la 'The Lost Boys'; has a character carve a cross into the tip of a bullet, which echoes both 'Curse of the Undead' (a vampire Western of the late '50s!) and 'Taxi Driver'; mentions Peter Cushing by name; and product-places a character wearing a 'Precinct 13' T-shirt.At one point the question arises as to whether anyone has actually read anything about vampires, or whether they're relying solely on movie knowledge: a fair question, and one that could be asked of Tarantino himself.  The refreshing possibility that maybe the story will adhere somewhat to actual folklore is sadly thrown away.  While certain folkloric traditions have it that vampirism is contagious, it's never described as incubating within minutes, as happens here.  And of course, the film's vampire peril ends when sunlight obliterates them--an enduringly popular movie device, although folkloric vampires aren't harmed by sunlight at all. (Neither are certain classic literary vampires, including both Carmilla and Count Dracula.)Then there's the cast.  OH, dear.  Much as I like Harvey Keitel, he's incredibly miscast as a Baptist preacher!  True, the character's pastoral days are behind him, since he's embittered over the death of his wife; still, putting Mr. Keitel in a white shirt, a pair of horn-rimmed specs, and a dorky straw hat doesn't make a credible preacher out of him.  Nor does it help that his character is so shallowly written: it's unconvincing that a man his age, who'd evidently been pastoring for some years, would completely blow off God on the basis of a garden-variety family tragedy.  I would have accepted that he'd take a long sabbatical, a road trip with his kids, to clear his head and to come to terms with his loss--probably with a well-thumbed copy of C. S. Lewis' 'A Grief Observed' close at hand.  The character's sketchiness isn't surprising, though, given the evident lack of research on Tarantino's part: with millions of Baptists in the U.S., you'd think he could've easily found out that Baptists don't make the sign of the cross OR use holy water!  This is just another example of how out of touch Hollywood is with ordinary American life.As Harvey's daughter, Juliette Lewis plays EXACTLY the same character she played in 'Cape Fear' and 'Kalifornia': the teenager of budding sexuality. I'm not a big fan of hers to begin with, but I REALLY don't get how she landed all these 'sexy' roles.  She's an OK actress, but if I had a dog that looked like that, I'd shave his butt and make him walk backwards.  I'd have loved to see Natalie Portman in this role instead.Didn't catch the name of the black actor who plays the Nam vet; he's good, but again, his material is cheesy.  When, during a lull in the action, he lights a cigar and begins a tale with the words, 'I was in Nam,' the audience I saw the movie with LAUGHED!  As Harvey's adopted son, Ernest Liu looks appropriately bewildered--almost as overwhelmed as he must have been in real life, making his film debut in the company of Tarantino, Keitel, and Lewis.  Salma Hayek plays Satanica Pandemonia--white snake and all!--the sort of role that might once have been played by Caroline Munro.  And Cheech Marin plays three roles--adequately, but Peter Sellers he ain't.All told, FDTD is a flashy but foul bit of fun, a trove of cliches culled from other (and better) vampire and action flicks.  Regrettably, it contributes--along with stuff like 'Bordello of Blood,' 'John Carpenter's Vampires,' etc.--to the the ongoing trivialization of vampire films.",Null,9,17,27 March 2003
Black Hawk Down," As close as you want to get to this type of action
","'Black Hawk Down' is director Ridley Scott at his razor-sharpest with a harrowing, relentlessly tense account of the semi-failed raid on Mogadishu, Somalia, in October 1993.  No jingoism here, and no false notes; no holding back, either, as we see dismemberment, intestines, and meatball field surgery without morphine.  Gripping and convincing, and an indictment of civilian micromanagement of the battlefield (for political reasons, the American troops are denied the protection of tanks and C-130 gunships), and therefore an acknowledgement of the sort of results you can expect with a draft-dodger in the White House.  As we continue the war against terrorism, let's hope the lessons learned in Mogadishu aren't forgotten.",Null,0,1,9 May 2002
Mission: Impossible," Mission: Incomprehensible
","Brian DePalma, whose earlier foray into big-budget Hollywood star-laden product was 'The Bonfire of the Vanities,' redeems himself here. Adapting an epic satirical bestseller for the screen is evidently far more difficult than adapting a '60s-'70s TV spy thriller. Cast includes Tom Cruise, of course; Jon Voigt, whom I hadn't seen in ages; Ving Rhames; whatsisname, the guy who jerked Harrison Ford around in 'Clear and Present Danger,' playing essentially the same smarmy insider jerk here; and Charlie Sheen in a tiny and thankless role.  The plot is a series of double and triple crosses in which Cruise is the patsy who has to figure out who's zooming who. Similar to 'Eraser,' the contemporary Arnie thriller, but miles more convoluted. Incomprehensible, in fact, but it works as a thrill ride.",6,2,5,23 September 2003
Signs," Mystery, menace, and significance
","'Signs' is typical Shyamalan: moody, spooky, deliberately paced, with an action star (Mel Gibson this time, instead of Bruce Willis) in a non-action role.  Having taken on the ghost story in 'The Sixth Sense,' and (less successfully) the superhero saga in 'Unbreakable,' the writer/director now takes on the alien invasion flick.  As usual, he approaches the subject on more than one level: the title has to do with a lot more than just circles in a cornfield.  Good thing, too, since the connection between the crop circles and the aliens is so tenuous, almost incidental, that the circles might have been dispensed with altogether.  In real life, crop circles have yet to be explained; claims by certain people to have created them as a hoax have themselves been exposed as hoaxes.  Gratuitously concluding that they must be connected to aliens is rather a lowest-common-denominator 'explanation.' Given the mystery surrounding crop circles, I'd have to say that the definitive movie about them has yet to be made.That having been said, 'Signs' has to be the lowest-key alien invasion flick ever, the very antithesis of 'Independence Day': there are almost no UFO effects to speak of (just the static shots the characters see on TV), no zap guns, no apocalyptic scenes of mass destruction; the invasion comes and goes overnight, like a bad dream, as our protagonists hide in a basement.  Only one of the invading alien horde is ever seen, as a shadowy, low-tech, man-in-an-alien-costume presence.  With its small cast, its few locations, its lack of CGI, and its absence of spectacular ambition, 'Signs' could've been made for a shoestring (if not for Mel's paycheck).  With its championing of the old-fashioned values of family, faith, recovery from loss, and a good baseball swing, 'Signs' could've been made in the '50s. For those of us who love the old 'Keep Watching the Skies' SF flicks, that's not a bad thing.",Null,0,2,13 September 2002
X2: X-Men United," Let me X you a question...
","When I think of the word 'mutant' or 'mutation,' I think of a 2-headed calf, or of all those frogs that were being hatched a few years ago with too many legs, or too few.  A kid who can freeze a cup of steaming coffee solid with a touch; a girl who can walk through walls; a woman who can control the weather... these aren't mutants.  They're miracle workers.Some of their powers are alarming: the chameleonic Mystique is a shapeshifter, the same category of being as a werewolf.  Some of their appearances are disturbing: for all his mainstream religious faith and recitation of prayers, Nightcrawler looks like nothing so much as a high-Medieval European concept of a demon.  And some of the 'mutants' are hostile and dangerous; but in my long life, all of the hostile, dangerous people I've ever known--all of the people who used their gifts and talents for selfish or harmful purposes--were NON-mutants.So what are we to make of, say, Iceman's chilling effects?  If mutations are nature's way of adjusting to stimuli, what stimulus brought about this reaction?  Or if mutations are simply random genetic misfires, what recessive genetic trait gave rise to this capability? 
I look at the question from the point of view of one who rejects the 'pure' scientific view of evolution: that life began by accident; that it (and we) developed completely at random; that it (and we) are simply biological phenomena devoid of any higher purpose or spiritual meaning.  I favor the view variously referred to as 'theistic evolution' or 'intelligent design.' Based on that viewpoint, I'd take a wildly unlikely talent such as Iceman's to be proof positive that God is up to something, and is doling out the equipment that'll be needed to cope with whatever it is that's coming.But Iceman's capability is like the laser at the time of its invention in the early 1960s: it was an answer without a question.  It took awhile to figure out the laser's usefulness in communications, surgery, etc. Similarly, the question presents itself: what is Iceman's gift FOR? and Storm's? and Mystique's? and Magneto's? and Pyro's? and so forth?  What are nature and nature's God up to with these people?  Why these gifts, and why these people?At this time we have insufficient evidence to answer these questions.  But it'll be interesting to see how it plays out.  Meantime, it's a good and appropriate thing that Nightcrawler introduces faith into the drama, and it's wise of the filmmakers not to caricature it.",Null,0,2,11 May 2003
Braveheart," The Highlands Chainsaw Massacre
","'Braveheart' is overlong, overripe, and overwrought, frequently crossing the line between the dramatic and the melodramatic.  We're an hour into the movie before the butt-kicking starts in earnest; up to that point there's entirely too much footage of William Wallace (Mel Gibson, who directed) and his lady-love making goo-goo eyes at each other.  Still, while this nearly-three-hour saga could have used some tightening up, I wouldn't want to see it pruned to much less than 2 1/2 hours long: there IS a lot of story here, and some wonderful characters, and I like it when a long story takes its time to unfold.  It's mainly the first hour that drags, after which the movie actually gets better as it goes along--a rare occurrence. 
As history, the story mixes in fill-in-the-blanks fiction with what little is known about Wallace the man.  We know Wallace was real--realer than Robin Hood and probably realer than King Arthur--but there's much we don't know about him.  We know he won the Battle of Stirling Bridge against the English, and that he was ultimately executed for treason.  Upon these bare bones is built a feast of red meat, well-researched in its depictions of medieval squalor, and unblinking in its smashing, horrendous, blood-spattered battle scenes.  Other than the movie's uneven pace, I had only a few quibbles, mostly about the liberties taken with historical fact.  For instance, it omits the bridge from the Battle of Stirling Bridge, which is like omitting the harbor from the attack on Pearl Harbor.  At the time of that battle (1297), the French princess (played by dishy Sophie Marceau) was only 4 or 5 years old.  Nor did she marry the prince until after he had become king, i.e., after Longshanks' death.  The film implies that Longshanks dies on the day of Wallace's execution; in fact, he died several years later... and was on his way back to Scotland, to stir up more trouble, at the time. 
Finally--or firstly--that silly title!  There's no such word as 'braveheart' in English (a language the Scots have never fully mastered).  Granted, the average history-illiterate American moviegoer (in this land where entirely too many people have been convinced that Cleopatra was black and can't tell you who the American Revolution was fought against) wouldn't have known who Wallace was, so putting his name in the title wouldn't have helped.  So how about something like 'The Highlands Chainsaw Massacre'?  Or 'Dead Men DO Wear Plaid'?  Or 'Mad Macs'?  Or--taking a cue from the image of Hamish defiantly hurling Wallace's sword into the air--'1301: A Scots Odyssey'?",9,3,6,25 September 2002
Donnie Darko," the dreams in which I'm dying are the best I've ever had
","'Harvey' meets 'The Mothman Prophecies,' as a troubled teen starts hallucinating a horrific 6-foot-tall bunny rabbit that brings him dark forebodings about death and disaster in the very near future.  A streak of 'Heathers' is mixed in as well, with trenchant satirical observations of high-school life in the late '80s (story set in Oct. 1988), involving a priggish teacher, a self-help guru (Patrick Swayze!), and a put-upon fat girl at the fringes of the herd.  Finally, a whiff of 'Back to the Future,' in the form of a local eccentric who just may have discovered the secret of time travel, but a secret that has more to do with spirituality than technology.   A lot goes on here.  There's a meditation on the possible overlap between madness and the ability to perceive the divine.  There's a demonstration of why, in the Bible, angelic messengers (if that's what 'Frank' can be taken to be) are often so terrifying that they have to start by saying 'Fear not.' There's an enlistment of what martial artists refer to as the 'ki' (or personal energy, emanating from a person's midsection) in the type of time travel depicted here (the term 'ki' is never used in the flick, but the term 'path,' another word for Tao or 'Way,' is).  Quantum physics theory about wormholes is tied to the Fortean phenomenon of things falling unexplained from the sky, in a way that's more pivotal, and therefore more interesting, than the gratuitous rain of frogs in 'Magnolia.'     Time travel paradoxes and ironies enter the picture as well.  One character (no spoiler!), whose life is saved by Donnie's ultimate trip back in time, wouldn't have died in the first place if he hadn't dragged her along to the opening of the wormhole.  Another character (again, no spoiler!), whose truly terrible secret comes to light in the wake of an arson investigation, must go unexposed as a result of that same time reversal, since the arson now won't happen.  Surely that's no oversight on the part of the screenwriter; it must be an acknowledgment of the choices and trade-offs in life, as well as of a confidence that no such terrible secret can remain hidden forever.     Somehow this pastiche works, largely on the strength of good performances.  Jake Gyllenhaal is appropriately moody and, also appropriately, not always likeable in the title role.  Drew Barrymore, who executive produced, appears as a frustrated first-year teacher.  The movie's often dreamlike atmosphere is enhanced by the cinematography, the subdued but effective special effects, and the choice of the music on the soundtrack, which includes '80's pop tunes, of course, and a haunting original song (over the end credits) titled 'Mad World.'   Not for all tastes, but better, stranger, and more complex than I expected.",Null,368,512,23 May 2002
