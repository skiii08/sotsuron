Blade Runner 2049," Bladerunner OR Investigator ?
","Seen movie hoping that a good sequel for old blade runner. But unfortunately this works went in vain.My observations are below.1. Detective officer working like a investigator instead of blade runner.
2. How many replicant he found and destroyed ? only one.
3. In 2049, where technology goes highly sophisticated, but attacks and defense styles are old like guns etc ? There is no improvement in fight sequence even holographic images looking like real? Surprising !
4. What is mystery of horse ?
5. Superstar and veteran actor Harrison Ford has wasted role. He looks helpless here, whereas He had played remarkable roles in many b grade movies.
6. No thrill and actions seen which is essential part of such science fictions.
7. Instead of thrill and actions, movie only focus on sophisticated future world.
8. As me there should have brief clipping of previous blade runner to link new one because there is 30 years gap in both movies.
9. No climax, but a dull ending. I hope no other boring sequel.
10. Rating 8.1 is wrong, it only desired 4 star.",4,4,10,12 September 2018
Skyfall," Its you ? James Bond ?
","This is not a 'Bond' movie. When I watch this movie in theater I greatly disappointed that not to fulfill my expectations as imagination by me. After first action reels the moves goes very slow. The bond girl does not do any action not daring act like previous ones. There are very rare chances to see comic touch of Bond. Also bond looks in non shaved face along with seen taking pills. He has no dynamic car nor fantastic gadgets. How he plan to take M at a non secured place where anyone can attack simply. This is not matched with the plan by Bond, the super spy. Disappointment goes at high when M died. Why can not Mr. bond survive her? I never expect from such super hero. Basically, this bond is very different from old like Roger Moore, Sean Connery etc. The both were original bond and their movies were full of thrilling excitements, comic lines, lucrative bond girls and extra villain character like hat man ( Harold Sakata in Goldfinger) or Jaws in Moonraker/Spy who loved me. Skyfall showing that bond is growing old and a slighter dull like Batman in Dark Knight Rises. As me all of our superheroes never grow old. They must young and active like past because they have ever responsibility of saving earth or world or all human being. Overall Skyfall is a boring movie and never to be compared with previous bond series. It is very alike from them. One who expect bond's famous capabilities or stunning action scenes with cars, gadgets and sexy bond girls definitely will disappoint.",5,8,18,5 November 2012
Deja Vu," Denzel Washington use time machine to save boat explosion and girl.
","Trust me I don't know this is science fiction about time travel before see this title. I only watch this for Denzel and get surprised. Interesting science fiction movie with mind blowing plot of time travel. Only keep in basic thing of time travel that if you go back in past and change some incident then a new time line is created and such is called ' Paradox'. Beginning part of the movie is a little slow but when investigation is going with multiple angles surveillance you are starting get interest in the movie, and then it will grip you till end with highly tension climax. However there are some flaws in the story such can a paper sheet travel back ? what is about interruption done by Doug while watching suvillience? and most questionable thing is where is crossing point between future Doug died in car blast and present Doug is coming from bank to see Claire ? Denzel is dashing as he is always. Photography is good especially boat and water. Must watchable for science fiction lovers.",8,0,0,11 April 2020
It," Stupid childish movie.
","What a rubbish and stupid movie like a childish horror. Though beginning horror sequence is promising, later movie goes like a garbage. Everything is predictable. Jumpscares are not scary. Even such horrified evil looks weak against normal human children, it is not believable. All children going anywhere and there parents do not asking them or worried about them except two or three children. Wow! One guy did super investigation about missing children in every 27 years but do not tell such information to the police, why ? They even do not take help of any elder. Some guys always talking sex topics. End is very very stupid and more you have to watch another wired instalment in 2019 ! God sakes us. I hit my forehead after watching such garbage and IMDB ratings at above 7 ! What kind of test of those raters ?",2,0,2,12 June 2020
Hereditary," Grandmother, mother and daughter all for ghost !
","I just saw Hereditary. It is a horror movie. However it is not so perfect. The story is as simple as confused too. I don't understand what is going on the screen and what the next and what is end? No ghost, no jump scares only ugly scences of insects crawling and invisible existence of dead people. What they want? This unanswered situation continues till the end, which makes us disconnect from the movie. Only at end we can find answers of all the questions but leaving also many loopholes backside to think you again about that. This is bothering the spirit of the movie. The story must have its power to bind you with interest till last moment. Here movie fails. Then even from horror genre I do not recommend it much. If you can avoid it would be better. Acting side is okay. Annie (Toni Collette) is perfect for fearful daughter and caring mother's role. Alex Wolff has no expression only plain face for his role of Peter. Whereas Charlie looking mysterious than innocent. And Gabriel Byrne as Steve looking dumb in sometimes. Planchetee is doing here a role to talk with soul of dead people but unfortunately that scenes are wind up in hurry. All the charm of such interesting thing went in vain.
Overall not recommended so. Avoid if you can. It is ridiculous to see such movie got high rated like 7.3?",4,0,1,11 March 2019
Wind River," good
","Good story with suspense, good acting and a snow land background, these are sufficient factors to stick you whole movie from start to finish watch. An FBI agent investigating of murder of a girl finds responsible a group of bad men. A local hunter helps her to complete her job. Good thriller. Here we met two Marvel character once again in simple role. one is Jeremy Renner ( Hawkeye) and second is Elizabeth Olsen ( Scarlet Witch). Impressive role by Jeremy Runner and inspiration speech by end increase value of the movie. Different background look of snow land takes you in a perfect feeling of snow land. Moreover this story is taken from real incidents. As me must watch for thriller lovers.",8,0,0,19 March 2020
Captain Marvel," Powerful Captain Marvel to enter End Game!
","Good movie from Marvel Studio. Understandable story not so confused or not too many characters like Avengers. Brie Larson is perfect in her role and she justified the role. They said this movie is made for Captain Marvel's entry in Avengers End Game, but in End Game she has very little role and not effective as it should be. Such powerful character must have bigger role in End Game. As me captain Marvel is better that Black Widow. We also got the reason here of why Fury's one eye covered in Avengers' series. Must watchable for Marvel lovers. I do not understand why so negative reviews here for such good movie and I strongly oppose to them who hated it. If you have not seen this yet then watch first and do not go with ratings or review.",8,1,6,5 June 2020
Us," Beware from your twins !
","It is second movie from Jordon Peele. ('Get Out' was first horror flick by him). A family of four went to Santa Cruz beach for vacation, where they meet another family. At the night first family sees an stranger family of our outside the house. But this new family is not friend. They are killers and wonder to us they are exact copy of them like twins of husband, wife, daughter and son! And real drama starts from here till the end. Thriller packed movie of 2 hours. Indeed good movie to watch. Not a single moment of boring. Not any sub plot and story goes straight on to the end with tension and thrill. If you looking story for logic then will be disappointed, because such clone idea is not clearly described. How was this project going on? Tunnels are not showing properly where these experiments were taken. And most reasonable question is that why are clones hiding from the world so many days and they appeared in now present day? So you overlooked story loop holes and enjoy only movie for thrill.
The most controversial part is the twist at the end. It is mostly illogical and unrealistic only for to shock viewers. As me the twist should have taken at the climax fight scene between Luptia and her clone. It would have been must trustable and effective and open for another sequel. Here chances of sequel are very rare. However movie is watchable at once. Good for horror and thriller lovers. You can enjoy a different type of fear rather than traditional ghost or evil horror.
Acting is well done by all actors and actresses along with juniors too ! (Twins have to act a little differ then a character must acted two roles )",7,0,2,12 June 2019
Knives Out," A small donghout in main doughnut !!!
","Good mystery plot of a rich man' killing and his unexpected will. All family is suspected along with a nurse. Brilliant acting by Daniel Craig (detective), Chris Iwan (Ransom) and (Marta) will bind you till the end. Background score is oldish but perfect for such suspense movie. Must watchable for every murder mystery lovers.",7,1,3,9 February 2020
Insomnia," Feel guilty deeply of partners' killing
","Very dull movie. Starting is good but middle long portion only feels boring. Climax is in hurry and predictable. Attitudes of Al Pacino is shown in initial interrogation is not continued further. Moreover his partner is killed by him mistakenly is been a big issue in the story, whereas AP did not kill him intentionally. This big issue makes movie lack its grip of suspense or mystery of murder. In other word to feeling guilty for parterre's killing is dominating whole story otherwise it could be a good suspense thriller. Acting by Al Pacino is just okay. Hillary Swank has a spark. However movie is not recommended.",4,0,0,19 August 2019
Aquaman," Underwater super hero from DC
","Now-a-days super heros are being popular than real heros. 'Aquaman' is another instalment from the line. This is from DC house and seems to be popular like Marvel Studio's characters. It is a good movie for adventure lovers. Jason Momoa is perfect casting for Aquaman. His towering height (6.4) and muscled body gave a real look to this new under water super hero. Other casting like of Nicole Kidman, Willem Dafoe, Amber Heard and Dolph Lundgren is okay. Amber Heard looks slim and a little dull than previous and having dimmer charm. Dolph Lundren is lost in his makeup. I actually did not recognize him for a while. Story is as required by an adventurous plot for comics. However photography is super. Various kingdoms like desert kingdom, Atlantis kingdom and other are amazing. Their sets are fantastic and filling real good. You will definitely enjoy from watching brilliantly portrayed those kingdoms. Though this is comical story for children, it is also watchable for parents also with their kids.I impressed to see a scene where an octopus is drumming with his all hands! How a unique idea! it surely will take you to notice this highlighted part of the move.My recommendation is just go and watch, no read any review further. It is full of enjoyment.",8,1,3,18 December 2018
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," Long and boring revenge with meaningless end !
","The story is taking revenge by mother for her daughters killing. Her styles of sticking three billboards of accused is looks unique, but actual revenge drama missed thrill at all. For final climax you have to wait more time. Moreover end is not right for such revenge story. What is in such end ? I don't understand. I also wonder about high ratings whereas there are many good revenge movies to name like ' Peppermint' of Jenifer Garner etc. If you wish to best revenge then must see Peppermint and avoid Three billboards instead for boring drama. 4 stars is enough.",4,1,5,24 December 2019
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Star wars without strong story.
",I have seen earlier parts in my childhood. They are masterpiece. But those prequels are average. God only save us from getting bore. Long story seems no ending. Ren looking somewhere like as Tomb raider.,4,6,13,25 March 2020
Nightcrawler," Simple story
","This is a very simple line story movie. There is no twist nor surprises. Else rest movie is okay to watch once. You can learn the tactics of starting new business especially in crime reporters. Main cast is perfect. Here ratings are not proper only deserve 5 star which I gave it.Suggestion only can be seen when you have no other option, otherwise definitely would feel of a time wasting.",5,1,3,20 November 2018
Bird Box," Seeing is dying
","Just saw so-called 'Bird Box' movie. It is a good movie, in spite of many views giving lower ratings and higher questioning. As me, the viewers must ignore all weak points of the movie and enjoy only with its horror genre. They will definitely enjoy a good thriller. I admitted that many questions are unanswered here if we think deeply rather than an entertainment. Many situations have no logic. Do not compare with ' A Quiet Place' . Performance of Sandra Bullock is brilliant. The scene where all house people are going to take groceries and essential items from supermarket through a blind car (with black colour glasses and operate on GPS) is really thrilling and horrifying experience. Also river side journey of Sandra with two children in a single boat is scaring situation. Loneliness atmosphere with fear of unknown entities' attack when opening of eyes is very frightened experience. You can feel this while seeing movie. These two parts of the movie are highlighter. But end is not as expected it has not much climax, perhaps second part will have more thrill and impressive end. However, go and watch the thrill and horror. Recommended by me with 8 stars.",8,2,7,4 January 2019
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," Bad Lisbeth Salander !
","Why did they make a stupid remake from boring story line and even after been made for many times, movies franchise and TV serial also? Moreover such foolish film gets high ratings too! Reason are here as me ;
1. Firstly movie is too lengthy which unnecessarily takes your more time to reach ending.
2. Daniel Craing (Mikael Blomkvist) and Rooney Mara ( Lisbeth) are totally misacted characters and wasted.
3. Various stories we can see in pieces of scenes alternately, so that we could not connect to any one of them.
4. Also hierarchy of Vanger family does not easily understandable i.e. one get difficult to know who is who?
5. No impressive climax.
6. Throughout half and more movie leading actors only searching and seeing photos, photos and photos only, they quickly get the clue from it and guess what was happened with whom, but viewers cannot use their brain so easily and quickly then failed eventually to connect the story.
7. Unnecessarily love making scenes which are really very boring and filmed like a porn movie.
8. Previous movie series ( Noomi Rapace starrer) was best and watchable.
9. Even in 2018 ( The Girl in Spider Web) is best thriller of Lisbeth Salander series.
I hate this movie. After wasting 2.38 hours I was disappointed with and had a heavy headache. Not recommended.",3,1,2,12 April 2019
Pearl Harbor," Masterpiece, the best movie on war history ! Don't miss !
","I just see this famous movie. Wonder to see low rating to such classical movie. Very very unjustified ! Movie is best in its genre. Brilliant photography, actual war like background and sets, real fighter planes, huge naval ships and pact screenplay with perfect acting, love triangle, sacrifice for frind, love and courage to fight against strong enemy in odd situations. Those are sufficient matter to watch this masterpiece movie. However end is predictable and war is dominating beautiful love story. Casting is perfect of Ben Affleck and his friend . Kate Beckinsale looks cute and lovely in her nurses' role. Significant role by in American president' ( Roosevelt) handicapped role. His last scene of standing on his legs and speaking at congress meeting is throwing chill in your body feeling scene. Very brilliant scene. Must watch never miss if you still not seen. Keep mind that movie is 3 hours over long.",9,2,4,30 April 2020
Resident Evil," Entertain with illogic.
","Just seen again after a gap of 10 years in the fear of infamous Corona virus and reviewing first time it. As me story is good, but screenplay is bad, somewhere plot is confused and not cleared. There are too loopholes in story and some are purely illogical. Presentation style covered all theses weaknesses. I think later parts are better. In other way I am fan of this franchise. Overall this part is essential to get basic of whole series.",5,0,2,25 March 2020
Avengers: Endgame," Nothing Outstanding !
","Just saw so called and talked this movie. It is just hype and to say truly it is a movie that marks below previous Marvel movies. Because after seeing this movie your mind will be empty and you will be not satisfied with whole drama feeling that something was missing, yes thrill of superheroes is totally missing here. Reasons are following as me, others may have their own different opinion than me, but me, watch the movie only for full of entertainment with not much expectation. High rated tickets should give you full value of your money and three hours of life. High ratings are false and all are copying to support only for this average movie.
Reasons are many;
1. The starting of last chapter is very slow and dull, whereas it needs some powerful actions or at least interesting incidents to keep viewers connect early to the story.
2. Hawkeye lost his family, how? And why not he lost himself ?. ( Thanos spares him?)
3. Planning to time robbery with quantum theory is very slow and time consuming only.
4. It takes too long time to start the real drama cum fight.
5. Time robbery is so confused. It is not cleared that how lost heros came return in life. What is that method was been applied not shown anywhere.
6. If Thanos is vanished by Iron man then how he will regain again to finish some superheros as shown in Infinity War ? Is there any paradox theories? Not cleared by director.
7. In this such a big saga of returning our lost heros into life, what is the role of Nick Fury as he only show his face at final scene. As me he must have a major role for planning the time plan.
8. There is only a single fight, first and last with not impressive only lengthy and boring.
9. Such super movie must have solid logic plot and here Infinity War was better.
10. Nothing new plot. I actually wait till end to happen something different.
11. Captain Marvel has no significant role here even her character was created with a single separate movie to enter in Endgame?
12. Thor is shown drunkard with tummy belly. It is not acceptable as our hero is our role model. I actually feel shame to see such nonsense thing.A very few things are good like CGI work, father of Iron Man, Natasha's sacrifice etc for name.Acting is okay and no one expect good acting in such comics movies.As me the movie is watchable but not for much entertainer. It is only deserve 7 star. And lovers of Iron Man and Natasha, don't be disappointed they will meet you in future because it is comics universe.",7,2,6,29 April 2019
It Follows," Wasted horror !
","Starting is interesting and gripping you in unknown fear from very first scene. We are waiting for unrevealed the suspense further,, but unfortunately it going dull in second half and nothing happened remarkable, and what happened that not justified with starting. Causing loose our interest. Moreover unnecessary & meaningless love making scenes are created here even in fearful situation, which no one expect in such horrible situation. Those were awful. End is also unbelievable. What a pity on a good horror material. Not much for recommendation.",3,4,5,25 July 2019
Gone Girl," Meaningless End
","Just seen this title. As me it is a family drama with a false murder and a real murder. The creator of those two murders is going apparently free. It is injustice. How such a wife having conspiracy mind lives happily with his hubby for ever ? Even father of her child is not confirmed.
However, most of movie is interesting and watchable. 90 % of movie desired 8 star and last 10 % part only deserves 2 star. Climax and end is not perfect according story which was going well till then from the beginning
I don't understand why a husband did not teach a lesson to such criminal minded wife? Why did not he take revenge for his harassment and insulting before the people, TV, Media and police etc ? That is why movie failed here, else it created a high expectations from beginning.Ben Affleck is good. Very good acting for betrayed & confused husband apart from his Batman's role or other heroic roles. Rosamund is perfect wife as requirement of role. Kim Dickens as detective is super. Also Carrie Coon has a memorable role of caring sister of Ben. Casting is perfect. Only week point in the movie is disappointing end otherwise movie would be the best. Watch only if you do like meaningless and empty end.",5,1,2,16 November 2018
Get Out," Black and white clash !
",": Horror but slow movie. First part of the movie is very dull and slow and story trails looks like a drama. Only ending part is interested. The story of a white girl and her black boyfriend. Both went girl's home, where boy realised something wrong even her family treated him well. What is the wrong? Is there any suspense? You can see this movie. But not much recommended. This is first film by Jordon Peele, but actually his second movie US is best. My suggestion is that you see US instead of Getout. However casting is perfect and acting by leading pair Daniel Kaluuya and Allison Williams is good. Also remarkable acting by Lakeith Stanfield (Andre). If you have no choices then see this title, but beware of its slowness.",5,0,1,18 June 2019
Aladdin," Only for Jasmine and Genie !
","I did not see animated version of Aladdin, then I am not comparing with it. Most of viewers compared. But as me there should be not comparison between two versions of same movie or story even after a long period gap, because each has its flavour and standard with their timelines.. So Aladdin should be judged as standalone.
Firstly to mention that the role of Jasmine, as it is major attraction of the movie. Naomi Scott is perfect for this role; she looks graceful and gorgeous with her stunning outfits. Her presence will give you relief from get boring from such old times Arabian tales which are mostly from magical background. I do not hesitate to say that Jasmine gave me full value of my money and time and actually went to multiplex only for her. Second mentionable thing is Will Smith. He comically played the role of Jin. Rest are okay. The tiger, the monkey, the bird etc for kids. Only flying carpet comes for you to ride enjoyable moments. Musical story telling is a new idea, but it seems a bit boring for me. My suggestion is that if you want to see glorious & charming princess and a comical Jin then watch Aladdin otherwise leave it.",7,2,6,27 May 2019
A Quiet Place," Horror of Silence
",The one of best films on post apocalypse. This movie is full of horror and thriller although a very few dialogues throughout. Siblings drowning in grain go down scene is really horrifying. Solutions to make no noise for daily activities are describing in many ways are great. Must watchable movie to horror and thriller lovers. I only complain that the movie is running a little bit slowly.,8,0,0,13 August 2018

Million Dollar Baby," MILLION DOLLAR MOVIE !!! MUST WATCH BEFORE YOU DIE....
","It is very touching movie! I just saw it for the name of Clint Eastwood 'cause I am big fan of him recently. This is his second movie I saw. Before see the movie I thought it would be a Rocky style movie where hero wins at the end in any situation. But here movie is totally different. At last crucial fight of Maggie she got hurt and made her to lying down in the bed. How pity! But my surprise, the real drama is just starting then and ends only in tearful eyes. I never expect such ending. It was a shock. That's why movie being different from others. It has two separate section first half is only boxing in pit and ring and rest second is in hospital.
Clint Eastwood has a brilliant and super acting as well as Hilary Swank too. Other is Morgan Freeman. Direction by CE is also superb. There is no wonder for winning 4 Oscars for such all time best movie. I strongly recommended for every movie lovers. Must watch (before you die.....as a list on IMDB).",10,2,3,27 March 2019
Resident Evil: Apocalypse," Better than Resident Evil 1

Prisoners," Lengthy kidnap drama of angry Jackman and calm detective !
","Just watch this title. Though it is a kidnapping thriller, I feel that thrill is lesser, the torture is more and suspense is unnecessarily stretching for a long way. 2.33 hours movie is very lengthy to such an average plot. only last 20 minutes will entertains you with shocking twist and stupidly uncompleted end. I wonder to see 8.1 rating for such lengthy and mostly boring movie even good acting by Hugh Jackman. But me impressive acting done by Jake Gyllenhaal in the role of detective. Climax suspense revealing is not well justified. End is not clear. Overall It is a very slow kidnap drama with lesser thrill and more boring with extra dose of torture. One thing is also me bother that there is no good looking actress in such boring drama to relief you as there are at least a beautiful actress in almost every Hollywood boring movies. If you are regular viewer of movies then you can realise.",4,0,0,19 March 2020
Inside Man," Safe Deposit No. 392 !!!
","Good thriller a little bit long and could have been shorter by 15-20 minutes. It is a heist movie. Illegal diamonds are stolen in its way, a unique way that makes you think very carefully to watch what was happened, what is happening and what would be happened. Along with thriller it is also a brain tester too! Story is strong and gripped you from very first scene and till end you will be fasten at your seat as there is much surprises and twists at the end of movie. Acting done by Denzel Washington is superb. Clive oven is just okay is clever thief. William Dafoe is as usual. Chiwetel Ejiofor having a comic touch in his detective character. Jodie Foster is impressive but as me it is unnecessary character. The story would go interesting till end without this role of Madeleine White. Rest is okay. If you are thriller lovers especially heist plots lovers then is it just for you. Must go and watch. Also to surprise me that a bollywood hit number ' Chhaiyya Chhaiyya' is tuning at opening credits and last ending credits. Was a tribute to A R Rehman ? And what is link of the story or movie to this hit dance number of Malaika Khan and Shahrukh Khan ?",8,2,2,8 April 2019
Mystic River," Boring & Complicated Stage Drama !!!
","Just saw this title. The story with some suspense but very long period drama. No major incidents occurred in whole movie makes one to lose interest. It looks like a stage drama rather than a movie. All major incidents are hidden. Story also itself is very complicated and confused. I actually did not well understand what was going all over. Perhaps I should have watch it twice but I have no patients to see such boring movie over 2 hours repeatedly. As it is taken from novel then it must be cinematic version when making movie. If you do not take advantage of filming camera to tell story interestingly then what is use of such powerful media? We may watch a stage drama is better way. I think Clint Eastwood failed here other wise he has directed many best movies like Million Dollar Baby, Gon Torino and The Mule. Whatever was but as me this is very boring movie despite good acting by leading actors. Nothing to say more about.",4,0,0,10 May 2019
Joker," Just a Bio pic !
","It is art type movie. Portraying mental state of a man while he is trying to make people laugh but get only hate from them. His mother lied on him about his birth, his well wisher woman hates him, people beat him and he lose his job. All worst condition makes him like a psycho killer. The story is as such way in short. Though movie is better than average it does not entertain you at all. You have to only watch a biopic of Joker. Sometimes it seems a documentary too. The character of joker should be played by a younger actor because in future joker will have to fight younger Bruce Wayne (Batman) as per my opinion. Also Joker is not smart and clever as per role in comics. However acting by Joaquin Phoenix is very good and appreciable. Mury by Robet De Niro is noticeable character. No other character does have much scope in such solo type movie. If you want to see a good entertainer with well storyline then you must avoid this biopic, you will be surely disappointed. There is nothing to excite you till end so think before go to 'Joker' and considering its slowness too. High ratings are not appreciated.",6,3,13,14 October 2019
Man on Fire," A Bodyguard and A girl !
","It is a good thriller of child kidnapping based on a novel. The story of a body guard who appointed to protect a little girl from kidnapping. After initial clashes between body guard (Denzel Washington) and the girl Lupita Ramos (Dakota Fanning) they develop a good relationship of father & daughter among them. After kidnap of Lupita Denzel Washington takes revenge and makes the things set right again. During this we can see a lot of drama of actions, emotions, conspiracy, corrupt police and system, deep network of kidnappers etc and apparently reveals some suspense too. We also came to know the real responsible person for such kidnapping with some twists. Rough and some drunken but care taker bodyguard played by Denzel Washington is very well in his role. A remarkable acting tone by Dakota Fanning. She is just fabulous!. Others are just okay. Very good movie. I recommended to every thriller lovers and giving 8 stars.",8,0,1,5 April 2019
It Chapter Two," More weird than chapter one !
",I thought it would be better than first but it is much garbage than previous one at least they are children. Second story is totally seems like everything is arranged no surprise no twist no horror and stupid climax and a hollow end. Plot is unrealistic. All team (all are grown ) is gathered on a call of a member (as he has contact numbers of all's even 27 years and no one has important work seems they are waiting for just call. Woman member hit her husband to run away instead of covencing him.). After meet they decided to arrange a riots to finish devil but actually this part taking place in last 20 minutes and meanwhile in 2 complete hours you have to watch meaningless flashback with some poor jumpscares. Total waste of time with no story. I fear if we could see chapter three too in '21. Avoid this stupid chapter else will be lost time and money.,3,0,1,13 June 2020
Arrival," Interpreter of arrival !
",This movie is not of arrival (alien ) but about its communication interpretation through a lady language expert professor. Most of part (65 %) consumes only on this activity which makes loosing our interest of a science fiction movie. Remaining 35% part is interesting and watchable however climax is not effective but is average. Background score is good especially while 'arrival' communicating professor. Answers to present day's problem find in future's hint is attractive part feeling definitely science fiction. Overall one time watchable but do not keep much hope for a interesting pure science fiction.,6,0,4,22 March 2020

Taken 2," Bad squeal
","Taken 2 is sequel to Taken. Movie is okay. As me it is only for take advantage of first Taken. First one was the best. Here only badly copied previous. All situations are predictable. I wonder some mistakes in the movie.
1. At first the villain cut the throat of Lenore. She is bleeding as hanged down but after that next few scenes we see her without a cut and she is fine. How?
2. Villain ties Bryan with loosely and leaves his phone in his socks without checking it.
3. Bryan traces her through various voices which he heard & learned in first blind journey. It is a good idea. But in real it is not necessary to same voice is playing on all time, like a man playing violin or dog is barking etc.
4. When he enters house all guards have their faces towards the house side instead of the gate. What is guarding!
5. Villains are vanishing as their serial order like tailor made order as main villan at last, second villain at second last turn etc.
Overall movie looks like not a good thriller. First half was very slow. It should be fast as required by such thriller.
My suggestion is if you saw 'Taken' then not necessary to see 'Taken 2'. There is nothing new and thrilling here. Watch only if you have no other choice.",5,0,2,26 December 2018

Based on a true story which is very simple not any twists or a single unbelievable situation. It is a saga of black and white human's friendship which grows from bottom to high sky. They give and takes interchange their native qualities. First part of the movie is not so impressive but when end is coming over then we realise the value of what we are seeing on the screen. Ending is very fascinating where 'Doc' comes Tony's house and meets them especially with Tony's wife.
As me this is the most emotional scene of the movie and other word it is highlight of the movie. Acting from Viggo Mortensen ( Tony ), Mahershala Ali ( Dr. Shirley) and Linda Cardellini ( Dolores ) are brilliant performance. Atmosphere of 18th century is created very well. Last credit gives you photo of real personalities of this story definitely will connect to the movie after ending too. Must watch for a different simple movie apart from routine Hollywood action or horror or science fictions.
It is filling like a chill shower of water pouring on you in high summer day.",8,0,2,22 February 2019
Da 5 Bloods," Give black their share.
","The story of 5 Vietnam black solders who find gold in wood at an ambush. How they take away for their men and what happened see on screen. I like one thing that the camerawork. It is versatile that in old incidents camera goes in short frame, when in current operation it goes full screen and when current time at out side the wood it comes with wide screen. Different camera angles give story a kind of look and being one interested.",6,0,1,2 July 2020
