The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," Moderate
","It's a lot different to the other Hunger Games in more ways than acceptable. One of the most notable is that they've really stripped down their signature High Fashion costume design and the film ends up looking like a World War Nazi film. It's not a train smash but I know lots of people who were turned off by it. Most agree, the first film was and is still the best. It seems the more they produce the more they lose that spark we all fell in love with. And sadly, the more people are starting to fall off the bus.Strangely, the hype is still there but after every film, we still wonder why. The franchise is not catching fire - it's dying out slowly. But even so, they leave us hungry for more. Particularly in this effort: the first part of Mocking Jay. But sadly after two long hours, the only real memorable part, is the end. Or rather, the last 5min when Peeta's back. And not because he's back (you need to watch it to know why - can't spoil it for you). Jennifer Lawrence, not so exciting anymore; Suspense, lacking; action, it was there but it didn't quite hit the mark.Hey, it's noticeably far better than 'Divergent'. But something's missing. Something's seriously missing! Can't quite put my finger on it. But I suppose everybody's tired and wants to bring it to an end. I guess it's about time. Do I recommend it? You can go without seeing it and still live.",4,2,6,21 July 2015
Captain Phillips," Waste
","A real Nail-biting, edge of your seat, suspense thriller. This one will really get your heart pumping fast and your hands on your head while you hysterically let out those 'No, no, no! Look out!' And oh no's.At least for the first hour it is. By the time it reaches the 60min mark, you realize that as the title implies, the film is actually about the captain. Which is quite sad considering that he's not a very interesting man. The film becomes very slow and drab from this point on. Then the navy starts playing a big role after an hour and 20min. But this is not a Michael Bay film so its still uninteresting.And then the pirate captain states: 'I've khom too far, Irish. I khan' give up now!' Feeling sad and sorry for him, he suddenly becomes a more interesting character. You start hoping to learn more about him and his back story. Forget it! You know how you felt during the final 45min of the last Lord of the Rings movie? 'Please let it end, please!' That's Captain Phillips.As much as I highly recommend the first one hour, you can do without watching it at all and still live.",3,3,5,21 July 2015
The Equalizer," Brilliant
","I'm honestly not much of a Denzel Washington fan (still not), however, I haven't enjoyed a film in a very long time as much as I did this one. It's got nothing to with Denzel really... well, at least for me it doesn't. But what truly made this film as outstanding as it was and utterly brilliant in every way possible, was the way it was written, the way the story unfolds, the way it almost forces you to be neutral (unless you're a Denzel fan then you're obviously cheering him on from the moment the production studio logos appear).But I cannot think of any other film (help me if you know of any) that so brilliantly makes two extremely opposite characters - the protagonist and antagonist obviously (or good guy and bad guy as we call them now), appear so similar, just to make them face off at the end in what usually is a sharp contrast of good versus evil. And it's really not a question of who's gonna win at the end (because it's obviously the good guy -duh!), but the challenging part really, is who do you root for!We all love villains - not that we root for them, but we just love the characters. But in this film, you not only love the villain, but you feel a strong urge to secretly root for him. Mainly because it takes a while for you to realise he's actually the bad guy. So torn between two worlds, you're literally forced to step out of the picture and eagerly watch the action unfold with bated breath to see what will happen next. By the time the end credits roll, you're still sitting motionless in your seat trying to take it all in. The adrenaline in this film is extremely high - even in some of the slower paced scenes. Watch with caution if you cannot handle that.",7,0,1,21 July 2015
Frozen," Worth a shot
","In all honestly, its actually not all that bad. Word on the street is that there's too much singing, but personally, I didn't find it overbearing. In fact, for a Disney film, I thought it was quite stripped down.Come to think of it, short of the magic, singing, princesses and castles, Frozen was nothing like what you'd expect from a Disney film. Its a little too serious for Disney. Actually, the entire weight of comedy was thrust upon the shoulders of the easily destructible Olaf, who mind you, did quite an impressive job at it despite his frailty.Still however, the film was more of a drama. Very deep and very serious. Almost like something Dream Works would produce. But it's really not bad. It's different and worth a shot.",4,3,11,21 July 2015
Prisoners," Incredible
","I am completely and utterly deprived and lost for words! I don't know whether to suggest you stay clear of this film and avoid at all cost, or whether to recommend it. Prisoners has really almost redefined the Thriller genre and in a sense, set the bar so high for upcoming Thrillers, its gonna take a master piece to get your heart racing even half as fast as this one does. 'The Equalizer' doesn't even come close to equalizing with this high ranker.Serving suggestion: use the bathroom before viewing and put your mobile on silent or better yet, completely off. This one requires no less than your full attention. And no matter how hard you try, there is absolutely no way you can predict how this film ends. I'll tell you this much though, the closing scene will blow you away! Either in a positive or negative way, but blow you away it shall - no doubt. By the time the end credits rolled, we were rendered frozen and speechless for a good 3 minutes before we all one by one got up and went our separate ways, still void of speech and comment.Flaws? Absolutely none, whatsoever. One thing I do know, is that this could easily be Hugh Jackman at his best. His performance was astoundingly brilliant!",10,1,2,21 July 2015
Lucy," Worth every second
","It's hard to watch 'Lucy' and not feel the need to compare it to 'Limitless' which had the same basic concept. 'Limitless was a great movie, but 'Lucy' is an excellent movie - limitless in almost every way.Brilliant performances from all the actors, mind-blowing stunts and action sequences, and not to mention the outstanding and memorable car chase scene which is an absolute must-see for everyone! Nevertheless, the film may come across as somewhat higher grade. So if you are one who prefers 'My Wife and Kids' over 'The Big Bang Theory', 'Lucy' is most probably NOT for you. Although the opening scene is very strong and gripping, the seemingly far-fetched, documentary-esque inserts of hunting cheetahs might puzzle some audience. How is it related to the film? It really isn't. Metaphorically, yes it is. But could they have done without it? Most definitely.The big question: will you be satisfied; is it worth your hard earned money? Certainly. However, the ending might leave you wanting more and feeling as though something is missing. The film is basically one long metaphor open to free interpretation. Everyone might have a different opinion of what its actually really about. None the less, best movie I've see all year!",7,1,5,21 July 2015
Furious 7," Great pop corn movie
","FF7 has pretty much almost got all you'd expect from the franchise. Almost! But Walker's got replacements so fear not.It's an excellent movie! Well worth the time and money. If you're paying to see some 'real' action, you're gonna get all that and more. A little bit too much more actually - I'm surprised they get away with it every time. But not this time! I get it, FF is about really fast cars, but I'm really surprised how much time the cars spend flying through the air instead of on the ground. Paul Walker's character even says: 'cars can't fly' right in the beginning of the film, as if to illustrate my point! Hack, one guy keeps his vehicle parked at the top of a skyscraper. 'He can do whatever he wants', they say. Seems like anybody can do whatever they want in this film. Granted, every film has it's sins and flaws but this particular film seemed pretty unapologetic about them. I think Statham makes for the worst villain ever. But we like him so we'll forgive them. The Rock isn't all that funny either.It has its brilliant sides. For one, the cinematography is exquisite! Aaaannndd.... Yeah, that's pretty much all I enjoyed about it. Don't get me wrong, it's not a complete do- over. It's actually quite good. It knows it's a a fun pop corn movie and lives up to that. Well worth the watch.",6,0,14,21 July 2015
