Casablanca," It Took Me a While to Come Around to This One
","Ah, 'Casablanca.'  Is there a line from the film that hasn't become a cliche?  That's not a criticism of the movie.  If anything it's the reverse. What greater compliment to a film screenplay can a film audience make than so completely absorbing every word of it into its common cultural consciousness?It took me a long time and multiple viewings before I warmed up to Michael Curtiz's 1943 film (by some accounts a 1942 release).  I'm not particularly a fan of either Ingrid Bergman or Humphrey Bogart, and the filmmaking techniques didn't strike me as anything inventive or unique and they still don't.  At best, 'Casablanca' exists as an example of the classic Hollywood style of filmmaking working at its slickest and most polished.But then on about the fourth viewing, it struck me.  The people who love this movie don't love it for the striking visuals or the daring narrative or any of the elements that make, say, 'Citizen Kane' such continual fuel for film discussion.  People still love 'Casablanca' for coming out at exactly the right moment in our cultural history, and somehow it's retained that 'right place, right time' allure.  America had been involved in World War II for at least two years by the time of this film's wide release, and many women had seen their men leave to face uncertain futures.  So no wonder a film with such an intense nostalgic glow about it would strike a universal chord.  No wonder the forbidden romance between the Bergman and Bogart characters seemed so instensely poignant.  And no wonder the patriotic, 'do whatever you must for the good of the cause' propaganda (for let's call it what it is), seemed so stirring (and still does).Is 'Casablanca' a great film?  I won't attempt to answer that, though it's not one of my personal favorites.  But any film that carries its legacy with it the way this one does can't be completely dismissed either.My grade: B+",8,4,7,18 August 2003
Gone with the Wind," Frankly, One Damn Fine Movie
","I know 'Gone with the Wind' has been teased to death, and there seems to be a sort of snob appeal among the film critical community in denegrating this film as overblown Hollywood melodrama. But the thing that impresses me about 'Gone with the Wind' after seeing it recently on the big screen is that it's one hell of a good movie. The entire first half moves with a propulsive energy that not many films can match. Victor Fleming (billed as director, though there were at least four director names attached to the project) stages one sensational set piece after another, and hardly a scene goes by without a quotable line or a memorable image.The success of any adaptation of 'Wind' is going to rely greatly on its Scarlett, and here I can't say enough about Vivien Leigh's performance. I quite simply cannot imagine any other actress in this role, so perfectly does Ms. Leigh embody it. She's in virtually every scene, but even after four hours of her, I'm not tired of her, and her ability to captivate the screen while she's on it doesn't lessen for an instant.Clark Gable is Clark Gable, perfect for his role as well and an able match for Leigh, but his performance plays as window dressing as compared to Leigh's powerhouse work.I also want to mention Olivia de Havilland. In her own way, she is just as powerful in her role as Leigh is in Scarlett's. Melanie's character is less dynamic and so by sheer necessity de Havilland is frequently upstaged by Leigh. But she holds her own nonetheless. And what struck me is the chemistry the two actresses have when on screen together. The scene in which Scarlett attends a party dressed in bright red, braving the gossip she knows will attend her presence, and Melanie walks slowly forward, determined to prove herself a refined lady by welcoming Scarlett unconditionally, is a tour de force for both actresses.I take points away for some soap operatic elements in the second half that grind the story to a halt, but otherwise this film deserves its place as one of the greatest achievements in American cinematic history.Grade: A",Null,1,2,18 August 2003
Lawrence of Arabia," Majesty in the Desert
","The moment David Lean makes you aware you are in the hands of a master comes early on in 'Lawrence of Arabia.'  Lawrence (Peter O'Toole) holds a lit match close to his lips and with one quick puff of air blows it out.  Before the action is even completed, however, Lean has cut to a shot of a desert vista, with the sun slowly rising over the lip of the horizon.  It's one of the most famous elliptical edits in cinema history, second maybe only to the bone/spaceship cut in '2001: A Space Odyssey.'  And it's only the first of countless memorable moments in 'Lawrence of Arabia.' The appeal of David Lean epics has always been his ability as a director to maintain an equilibrium between the scope of his films and the characters in them.  Character development is never sacrificed to massive set pieces or knock-your-socks-off action sequences.  'Lawrence of Arabia' has these elements too, but at heart it's a character study of one remarkable man. Lean seemed to understand that impressive landscapes alone are not inherently interesting; but if you place a fascinating character among those impressive landscapes, you can have movie magic.'Lawrence' feels unlike other historical epics of its time.  In most 'big' films--I'm thinking of movies like 'Ben-Hur,' 'Spartacus,' 'Cleopatra,' all movies that premiered roughly around the same time as 'Lawrence'--one gets the sense that directors framed compositions based on how much they were able to fit into their widescreen lenses.  One rarely sees characters filmed from anything closer than a medium shot, and usually the background is stuffed to overflowing with garish art direction.  Everything feels static and wooden.  But in 'Lawrence,' Lean keeps his frames constantly alive by juxtaposing huge landscape shots with extreme close-ups of actor faces.  In one especially brutal scene, after a battle that results in the slaughter of many people, the action cuts to a close-up of O'Toole, looking panicked and crazed, gripping a bloody knife in his hand as if he's reluctant to drop it, obviously both disturbed and titillated by the carnage he just witnessed. It's moments like that---not just an impressive battle scene but a character's reactions to the results of that scene---that set 'Lawrence' apart from other standard epics.And of course, I have to reserve space in my review for the performance of Mr. O'Toole.  He is perhaps my favorite actor, not one of the most prolific, but certainly one of the most unpredictable.  He has a flair for choosing eccentric characters that give him almost unlimited room in which to perform.  He carries 'Lawrence of Arabia' almost singlehandedly on his slim shoulders.  That's not to say the supporting cast isn't great, but O'Toole towers above them all.  O'Toole understands that the most influential figures in history could also be the most difficult and ruthless when they needed to be, and he gives Lawrence an incredibly complex characterization, leaving his audience in doubt as to whether he should be worshipped or feared, or perhaps both.Lean would never direct an equal to 'Lawrence of Arabia' again.  His later films are certainly more than watchable, and 'A Passage to India' is even quite remarkable in its own way, but we would never get another 'Lawrence.' Even more reason to appreciate it now.My Grade: A+",9,1,4,19 August 2003
Life Is Beautiful," Roberto Benigni should be locked away
","1998 saw the release of three high-profile films about WWII, and 'Life Is Beautiful' is by far the worst.  It's silly, manic, zany--all good qualities if we're watching a Mel Brooks film.  But there's something distinctly distasteful about a joke built around the drudgery prison camp inmates were forced to undergo.  Call me a stick in the mud.  Tell me I missed the point of this movie.  I've heard it all.  However, I didn't miss the point of this movie.  Roberto Benigni isn't exactly Ingmar Bergman, and his points aren't all that hard to grasp.  And I don't mind the point of the movie.  I just hated the execution of it.As for the other two WWII movies released that year, I thought 'Saving Private Ryan' stunk too.  I know, call me sacriligeous, but there you have it.  On the other hand, I thought 'The Thin Red Line' was breathtaking--a stunner, pure and simple.",3,4,10,6 July 2001
A Beautiful Mind," More of the same from Ron Howard
","I wasn't at all excited about the prospect of sitting through 'A Beautiful Mind,' but since I enjoy the Oscars much more when I've seen the majority of films up for competition, I felt obliged to see this one.  I can't say I was disappointed, because I didn't expect much to begin with.  The film is typical of what I've come to expect from Ron Howard: polished, glossy, safe, and dull.This is the kind of movie where everyone looks like they've stepped out of a magazine.  Everyone is attractive, and if there are characters who aren't, they stay well within an acceptable range of unattractiveness.  Welcome to Ron Howard's world, where the techniques of film making are so encumbered by the demands of mainstream movie America that one feels as if he's seen this movie already. And you have.  If you've seen any film about someone overcoming a mental illness to deliver an uplifting message about the triumph of the human spirit, you've seen 'A Beautiful Mind.'  It's paint by numbers film making.  All of the required scenes are there---I felt as if I needed a little checklist so that I could tick them off as I went. 
Russell Crowe does o.k. with his role, though it's mostly a collection of physical tricks rather than a fully fleshed out performance.  I don't know why everyone's going nuts over Jennifer Connelly.  She's adequate, but nothing more, and she isn't given a lot to do as Nash's stoic wife.Nash's schizophrenia is handled with sledgehammer subtlety by Howard.  The movie could and should have been much shorter had whole scenes detailing Nash's hallucinations been left on the cutting room floor.  I'm sorry Ed Harris---I like you, but your whole performance could have been left out and the movie would be unchanged.Howard treats mental illness like it's a new topic that's never been dealt with before.  He's caught Steven Spielberg syndrome---it's as if he suddenly feels it's his duty to bring awareness to 'serious' topics, but he handles them in such a shameless way, and gives his audience such little credit for being able to understand and appreciate nuance (let alone have a genuine emotional response) that his movies are becoming progressively tedious and boring.I'm waiting for 'Parenthood 2.'  Let Howard get back on familiar terrain.",Null,0,1,13 March 2002
The Wizard of Oz," This Takes Me Back
","It's nearly impossible for me to write objectively about the quality of 'The Wizard of Oz,' so bundled up is it with associations from my childhood. It's like trying to do a critical analysis of 'Star Wars.'  Sorry, can't be done---at least, not by me.'Oz' is such a strange movie, in some ways so creaky and old-fashioned, in other ways so incredibly ahead of its time.  Few films I've seen during my lifetime have such a complete vision as 'Oz' does---such painstaking care went into the look and design of the film; it's as if the filmmakers really did create a whole other world for this film to take place in.  It's odd that during a time in American film history, when movies were being cranked out like cars on an assembly line, a film could feel like such an auteurish product (increasingly odd, since the credited director, Victor Fleming, actually shared directing duties with several others.  The same is true for 'Gone with the Wind,' released in the same year and also bearing Fleming's name as sole director.  He was quite a lucky guy in 1939).The plot and feeling of 'Oz' veers quite a bit from that of the book on which it is based.  The book is much nastier and darker, but the film manages its fair share of grimness for all that.  The Wicked Witch is spectacularly scary (Margaret Hamilton admits to regretting the intensity with which she approached this character) as are the Flying Monkeys. There's such a feeling of ominous dread underlaying this entire film.  As if the land of Oz is a bit too beautiful and perfect, like a perfectly ripe piece of fruit that at any moment can begin to rot at the edges.Really, despite her scariness, the Witch is the most fun character in the film---it's really a riot to watch this film as an adult and enjoy her sarcasm and nastiness; it's refreshing as juxtaposed to the goody goodiness of the other characters.  Frank Morgan in a variety of roles is also great.A cloud of darkness has come to surround this film over the last couple of decades, due to the urban legends about the stagehand supposedly caught on film hanging himself and the truly bizarre stories about the arduous process of making the film (and the many accidents and tragedies that occurred along the way).  This reputation may be responsible for the cult status that has arisen around this film and perhaps even for elevating it to the level of admiration it has received.On a side note, an excellent book by Gregory Maguire called 'Wicked' offers back story to the events leading up to 'The Wizard of Oz,' and most particulary focuses on the early life of the Wicked Witch of the West.  It's an outstanding book, and I venture that you won't be able to watch 'Oz' in quite the same way again after reading it.Grade: A-",10,1,2,20 August 2003
The Godfather," Oh Those Corleones
","No American filmmaker has had a more disappointing trajectory to his film career than Francis Ford Coppola. To have directed four of the most influential films of the 70's (the first two 'Godfather' films, 'The Conversation,' and 'Apocalypse Now') and then to spend the last two decades churning out one stinky product after another ('Peggy Sue Got Married,' 'Bram Stoker's Dracula', the third 'Godfather') earns Coppola my award for Most Promising Director Who Most Miserably Failed at Establishing Himself as an Important Figure of American Cinema. But before 'Jack' there was 'The Godfather.' While I feel the whole 'Godfather' trilogy has been lauded into oblivion and is somewhat overrated, who am I to argue with the majority? People think these are great movies, and they've certainly implanted themselves permanently in our cultural consciousness.And don't get me wrong: these films have moments of greatness (at least the first two installments do). But I think 'The Conversation' and 'Apocalypse Now' are ultimately more interesting films, and I think Coppola stretched himself more artistically in those two films than he did in the entire 'Godfather' trilogy combined.Of the trilogy, the first film is by far the best. It shows Coppola's flair for being able to craft a story with extreme mainstream appeal while staying faithful to his artistic vision. 'The Godfather' doesn't look or sound quite like any gangster film before it, with it's muddy lighting and sound. It's also much more ambiguous morally than the usual Hollywood gangster film, at least any produced up to that point. The line between crime and justice is blurred sometimes beyond distinction, and the Corleone family at times acts with more honor (in its own way) than the institutions charged with upholding freedom, justice and morality. In this way, 'The Godfather' offered a scathing critique of the foundations on which America as a country was built.Coppola, however, drives this point into the ground over the course of three films. There's really not much more to say after the first film (it's already apparent that Michael Corleone's style of rule is different from his father's, his coldness and ruthlessness necessitated by a changing time), but we have to sit through a nearly 3 1/2 hour second installment that does nothing but reiterate this point again and again. Part II at least is saved by the back story of Vito Corleone (played by Marlon Brando in Part I and Robert De Niro in Part II), and that story alone keeps Part II afloat. But Part III is wholly unnecessary and mars the whole enterprise, turning the franchise into the stuff of parody and camp.Al Pacino is the glue that holds the trilogy together, though his character really isn't as complex as a first viewing would have you believe. The major conflict facing him is resolved in the first film, and the second and third films give him nothing to do but replay what are essentially the same scenes over and over again.Other standouts in the cast include Robert Duvall, Diane Keaton and Talia Shire (who alone makes the third chapter worth watching).Obviously a must see for cinema buffs, or even casual fans, but don't feel you have to label this trilogy as great just because of the reputation that precedes it.My Grade--- Part I: A Part II: B Part III: C-",9,0,2,18 August 2003
