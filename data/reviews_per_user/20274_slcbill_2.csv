Deja Vu," Great Film
","It is very difficult to make a film of this type without leaving 'loose ends.' In this case, they have succeeded to tie up everything very well. It is the sort of film you have to see again to catch all of the nuances. As usual, Denzel Washington delivers a great performance. It is a credible screenplay which delivers very well on its premise. The choice of location is especially appropriate. The parallels with the perils in today's world cannot be missed. There is no 'grandstanding' or 'preaching.' It is a very well executed presentation of a very well written and excellently cast screenplay, and all involved are to be congratulated. I will see it again, and likely purchase the DVD. It is an 'action movie' with intellectual depth, a rarity.",10,1,3,26 November 2006
The Nightmare Before Christmas," Preview of things to come...
","Watch out 2-D, your days are numbered. The film is, of course, excellent. The 3-D rendition is extremely good. Nothing has been lost in the translation. The change was made without resorting to gimmicks, everything looked exactly right, it was completely enjoyable. The soundtrack was much more effective and contributed to the effect. Even the Disney logo in 3-D was impressive. Our showing was accompanied by a preview of a 3-D film, action adventure, coming out next year. It was also very impressive, as it was created with 3-D in mind. I think this represents another paradigm shift in mass entertainment. As the 8 track gave way to the cassette, the cassette to the CD, I believe that this marks the beginnings of the transition of conventional 2-D to digital 3-D. It will take a few years, but eventually it will be the standard. It will likely hit the video gaming world first, but the train is coming. Of course, this is only my opinion, I could be wrong...",10,0,0,22 October 2007
