Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," A Love/Hate Relationship...
","This will go down as one of the most controversial films in history. You either loathe or completely embrace this latest saga in the Star Wars films. I fall somewhere in the middle of the two. Of course the first 3 movies are some of my favorite movies of all time, probably in the top ten. Expectations were way too high for Phantom Menace to begin with - but I have to fault Lucas for some major big league mistakes with this picture. First, Jar Jar Binks. This guy is irritating beyond all reason and sanity. I think Lucas was trying to imitate the successful Disney formula of an annoying jabbering sidekick. We could also do without the body fluid humor and what-not, it's just juvenile and has no place in a Star Wars film. A lot of the dialogue is forced and comes off flat. I know Jedis are supposed to be serious but come ON now. Ben Kenobi was never boring! Third, the plot was unimportant and not very involving. I guess it got the job done but the aliens didn't seem very menacing (the ones in Galaxy Quest were far more threatening!) and none of the characters made you care about them. Now - the plus side: the special effects have seen no equal since, and will not until Episode II. The podrace scene and the battle scenes are all expertly designed and executed. The music by John Williams is awesome as would be expected. And we have some good amounts of intrigue and suspense as a good setup for Episode II. I would advise you ask around before deciding to purchase this one, but you definitely can't go wrong with a rental. Just remember to mute the TV when Jar Jar comes on screen.",6,0,1,22 June 2001
As Good as It Gets," Actually pretty good!
","I saw this movie in the theater back in 1997 and just rented it again last night. It holds up pretty well and contains some fine performances by Jack Nicholson and Helen Hunt, who both won Oscars that year. The story is highly original in its choice of characters and their relationships all being intertwined as they are. Nicholson's character, while mean and hateful, cannot be disliked and as the movie goes on, you really start to feel for the guy and his illness. I know some people with similar behavior patterns and it's totally beyond their control, this obsessive-compulsive behavior. This movie is also laugh out loud funny, which was unexpected when I first saw it. If I had to add any negatives, it would be that Nicholson seems too old to be a partner for Hunt, something about it doesn't quite jive. Also, the last 30 minutes of the movie seem to drag, as you are never quite sure where it's going with the unpredictable plot - however it being unpredictable also makes it so enjoyable. To sum it up, I was glued to the screen, mesmerized by Nicholson's amazing portrayal of his character, laughing out loud quite a few times and felt appropriately warm and fuzzy while the credits rolled. Check it out, but definitely bring along your significant other! :)",8,0,0,22 June 2001
Memento," A must-see!
","I rarely go to the theater anymore, with most movies consisting of overblown Hollywood drivel such as Pearl Harbor and the like - but Memento is a true masterwork of film-making, very original in its concept and execution. The reverse chronology always keeps you guessing, as you play out the plot in your mind again and again. This is a thinking man's movie to be sure. My only negatives would be that it is quite dark and disturbing in its subject matter, with a lot of tension that some might find hard to deal with. But this ranks up there with the likes of Fight Club and The Usual Suspects in my book. Drop everything and see this now or buy the DVD when it's eventually released!",10,0,1,7 June 2001
Aliens," A *perfect* sci-fi film!
","This is my #1 all-time, most favorite, most watched movie EVER! Need I say more? Hmm ok. James Cameron is a genius and his directorial mastery is most evident here. Forget Titanic and Terminator for a second and let's discuss ALIENS. For a movie that is 15 years old the special effects still hold up even today - that is just amazing. Never did I doubt the reality of the movie or the possibility of aliens such as those in the film actually existing. This is a film that will give you nightmares. You'll care about the characters because they are ALL likeable and fun. There's more one-liners than a Schwarzeneggar movie here too, talk about the quotage! The music by James Horner is also first rate and heart pounding. It's also a testament to pacing and intensity that the last hour of the film is filled with so much tension and drama that you will feel worn out by the time the credits roll. And get this: Sigourney Weaver was nominated for Best Actress for her role. How many action/sci-fi movies get acting nominations? Virtually none. Check this movie out, don't even rent it, just BUY IT immediately on DVD.",10,3,5,22 June 2001
