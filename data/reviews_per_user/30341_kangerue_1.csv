Black Swan," Not Interesting
","I thought this would be more lively and thrilling, but it was not. The idea behind the movie had potential but it ended up being so stale and boring.If you saw the trailer and thought 'oh cool, some kind of psychological thriller -- this looks good!' Well it is, but don't see it. It's not a good one. Go see 1408.I think the only reason this movie will become popular is the lesbian scene... and the ample sexuality of two famous celebrities. Why does this movie have 8.7/10? I would give the trailer 8.7/10, but not the movie. They could have condensed this movie into a 30 minute episode of the outer limits. There was just no substance to it. Mila Kunis and her scenes were far more interesting that the rest of the movie. I think it would have been better if she was in it more, but it felt like she was barely in it.",5,3,17,30 December 2010
