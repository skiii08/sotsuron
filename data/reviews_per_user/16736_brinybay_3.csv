Walk the Line," Not sure what all the fuss is about.
","This movie is boring. I suspect the reason all the folks lavishing praise on this movie is because they are drug addicted amorals themselves, like how JC is portrayed in the movie, and they will laud anything that glorifies that sort of thing.Not even any original soundtracks, the lead uses his own voice does a mediocre job. He had a lip curl that looked more Elvis-ish. I didn't understand that at all until I learned the lead actor has a hair-lip. For cryin' out loud, what where they thinking? The only thing that stood out was that JC was a self-absorbed, emotionally immature drug addict still dwelling on child-hood traumas. He dumped his family for a little cutie (June Carter) he met on tour. I did not get a sense of romance out of it at all. I did not feel any empathy for JC as he was portrayed. To the contrary, I thought he was a creep. Nothing of the later part of his life that would possibly show some redemption of some kind (didn't he find religion later?) I liked JC as a musician, but came away from the movie having lost all respect for him as a man.",2,3,11,26 March 2006
Amadeus," Great period costumes and historical scenery, but...
","I'm not a fan of opera, and the lead character seemed like a parody of an 18th century composer. With that retarded giggle and the demeanor and language of a present-day adolescent male, at times I thought I was watching something from SNL. If it wasn't for the fantastic period costumes and historical scenery, I would have turned it off in the first 15 minutes.The plot was interesting, although I'm not a big fan of flashbacks. Even then, I only got half way through it and sent it back. I may re-watch it for the costumes and scenery, but that's the best I can say about it. I'll give it a 5 because of the effort that went into the costumes and historical scenery, otherwise I would have given it a 2 or 3.",5,4,13,9 September 2007
Wedding Crashers," El-Stinko
","Yuck. This one was just as stupid as 40yo Virgin. Call me old-fashioned, prudish, whatever, but I get really tired this theme: A man's worth and manhood is directly measured between his legs and by his sexual conquests. I also get tired of women being portrayed as having no brains at all and their worth directly measured by their physical beauty. This movie would have you believe that two professional men have no other way to socialize with women and enough spare time to research and crash weddings. They would also have you believe that there are lots of weddings with beautiful young women who have such little intelligence as to mistake the guys stupidity for charm and hop in the sack with him. Give me a break! I know it's just a movie, but for something to be funny, it has to have an element of truth or believability. The only funny part was when the one guy explained why he doesn't date to his secretary.",1,2,4,25 February 2006
