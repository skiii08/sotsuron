Source Code," After 20 mins, absolutely no tension whatsoever
","Source Code has a good idea and perhaps if it was done just slightly differently, it might have worked. Jake Gyllenhaal makes a solid leading man and the premise is pretty interesting. But roughly a third into the movie a plot twist is revealed that pretty much nullifies the entire premise. All the tension goes out of the movie, because none of it matters from this point onwards.Gyllenhaal's character reacts somewhat erratically to the situation at hand, but you can't really blame him. But yet again the twist gives no real reason to invest yourself in this character. At that point you are left with the other side to the story. It's not really possible to divulge more without venturing into spoilers, but there is not enough to really, well, care. An alternative take does emerge in the end and is used to conclude the movie, but not enough of the script gave this enough attention to hold any merit as a hook.Otherwise this is a reasonably good thriller. If you can find suspense in the inevitable, then you might still get something out of this.",Null,3,6,14 October 2011
Horrible Bosses," Good fun
","As a whole it is hard to pinpoint why Horrible Bosses is funny, but one you get into the individual set pieces, it is a lot of fun. Similar to such classics as Forgetting Sarah Marshall (though not as raunchy), it has its moments - and lots of them.A special mention has to go to the three bosses, played by Jennifer Aniston, Kevin Spacey and Colin Farrell. They obviously loved playing these terrible characters. the three leads are also loving it, moving from plan to panic with startling brilliance. And Jamie Foxx needs a nod for his colourful thug.Every year produces a handful of really smart, fun and down-to-Earth comedies that revel in their overstatedness. This is one for 2011.",7,1,2,4 October 2011
Tucker and Dale vs Evil," Good fun For Genre Fans
","I must admit to being a big slasher fan, though it can be a relentless genre to follow. All but the most hardened fan could stomach everything produced around a monstrous killer stalking a group of babbling teenagers. Not in terms of gore, but quality. Good ideas are often not around and cheesy imitations tend to do the rounds often.There have been attempts to rework the slasher in a comedic sense. Scream probably did it best, but Tucker and Dale vs Evil comes close in quite a special way. It's not a mainstream movie, but this pseudo-parody of 'hillbilly horror' (think Deliverance or Wrong Turn 2) does a good job paying respect to the genre while also poking a lot of fun at it. Sure, not everyone will like it, but you can also pass it off as a very 'stupid' movie. A future cult classic.",9,2,2,11 January 2012
Drive," A Wasted Chance
","This is not a bad movie, but it's not really anything special. It would have been, had it stuck to its name and initial theme. When you have a driver who is obviously good at his job, you tend to expect something that might echo Ronin or the original Gone In Sixty Seconds. It certainly has the talent - especially one incredibly spectacular car chase just before the third act. Had Drive continued onward from this point with a long (or several) car chase, it would have been something special. The first two acts build up nicely for just this, with an intensity that evoked movies like Sympathy For Mister Vengeance.Unfortunately it doesn't, instead opting to wrap up like a text-book Film Noire. Drive could have been so much more. Instead it becomes a paint-by-numbers tale.This might have been one of the best car-porn films made in living memory, but it failed to follow its destiny.",Null,1,7,2 October 2011
Unknown," Smart and lean
","Comparisons with Taken, Liam Neeson's action tour de force, are both apt and improper. This is much more of a thriller, where a doctor wakes from a coma to find that only he believes who he is. Thanks to how the film start, so does the audience and the script smartly makes you doubt the main character after a while.But this is not a mystery film and it soon cranks up the dials, converting into a pseudo-action movie that is just on the border of believable. A lot of this goes to Neeson, whose worst talent as an actor is to fake an American accent. His best, though, is his screen presence and ability to take the audience along. Give him a well-paced script and he does brilliantly. And here he does brilliantly. Even if you see the twist coming, you'll enjoy the ride.",Null,1,2,4 November 2011
Blood Diamond," Intense But Entertaining
","Leonardo di Caprio has shown his chops as a leading man, but it's hardly a surprise considering his last few movies. He lends a good level of gravity to a role and its themes, while remaining extremely entertaining and unpretentious. As Blood Diamond shows he tends to work with scripts and directors that enjoy a dollop of popcorn sentiments. It's perhaps no surprise that Martin Scorcese's best modern work was with Leo. Not that Blood Diamond isn't serious or intense. It packs quite a moral message about war and greed. But the story never wanders too deep into navel-gazing territory and keeps the pacing solid. Djimon Hounsou is fantastic - and the real anchor - as the embattled fisherman trying to save his family, while sadly Jennifer Connelly's journalist character is a tad convenient, but serves a role nonetheless. It's a fairly violent and heavy-handed film, but it never loses sight of what it wants to do - entertainment with a message. And it does that well.",Null,0,0,17 October 2011
Taken," A bleak action thriller that's perfect for the Bourne crowd
","Ah, I notice some critics are making a fuss about racial stereotypes, etc. Sure, the bad guys are Albanians, but they also include Arabs, French and Americans. Besides, Neeson is Irish, so I'm at a loss over the strange politically correct beating the film is taking.This is a solid action film that fans of the Bourne movies will really get a kick out of. Relentless in its action and violence (especially because Neeson plays a father who would stop at nothing to get his daughter back), though be patient as it is a slow starter.Yes, it isn't entirely believable, but I'm sure very realistic spy stories are really boring. To complain that this stretches the truth is akin to putting Bourne or Bond under the same scrutiny. So ignore the bad press. This is a good, if bleak, action movie.",9,1,4,13 December 2008
Get Him to the Greek," Sarah Marshall Gone Wild
","The tern 'toilet humor' is often thrown around without a care of how broad it is. Outrageous, tasteless jokes can - and often are - done badly, but when the script pulls no punches, the pacing stays good and the performances are sharp, you can get quite a gem. Forgetting Sarah Marshall did this well with off-kilter jokes and a hint of oddity. But this spin- off takes it well beyond that, adding a level of insanity that elevates it even above the likes of the Hangover. In other words, if you liked that movie, you should watch this. It remains consistently demented, with Russel Brand's Aldous Snow keeping the fires burning while Jonah Hill as the blindsided intern makes the perfect hapless victim. Also worth catching for Puff Daddy as a crazy record mogul and a sequence in Vegas that is just unforgettable.",8,3,5,16 October 2011
Fast Five," Does What It Says On The Box
","A thinner script, a bigger stunts budget and a cast that is busting at the seams from all the muscle and machismo. It even has Joaquim de Almeida to chew the scenery as the proto-bad guy drug lord. It's a total paint-by-numbers Fast and Furious, but with everything cranked up to a ridiculous level (and a lot of the flab trimmed away). If the opening scene does not make you realise that using your brain is a drawback, you shouldn't watch Fast Five. But if you can switch off, it's a lot of fun (especially the totally unrealistic final action sequence). It's the action move that just keeps on giving. For fans there is a sense of conclusion to the characters, but who has been watching these for the story? Car porn and explosive action: that is pretty much this package. Sit back and enjoy.",Null,1,2,2 October 2011
Warcraft," A mess, comparable with Dungeons & Dragons or Jack The Giant Slayer.
","Opinions are clearly divided about this movie, so I will keep my criticism to a few points: <ul><li>This movie drags. The pacing is really uneven, even though the plot seems to be pretty lean. Perhaps its the large cast, so the action is always jumping around to contend with different threads. Eventually a lot of it isn't surprising and a number of twists get telegraphed way in advance.</li></ul><ul><li>Travis Fimmel phones it in, which is a problem since he is the lead. He also appears to often be the comic relief, which is an issue since he is one of the tragic characters as well. His jokes mainly fall flat. Contrasted to his role in vikings, there is none of the screen chemistry that makes him so watchable.</li></ul><ul><li>Overall the acting is tonally all over the place. The director didn't seem to pay much attention to guiding his actors.</li></ul><ul><li>The special effects are good, but also very clearly special effects. At times it felt like an animated movie. This constant shift in tone doesn't help suspension of disbelief.</li></ul><ul><li>Some design is great, especially among the orcs. But then some design or costume choices seem really dumb. The king looks like a parody of the prince from Men In Tights and in some parts it is clear when sets were recycled for different shots.</li></ul><ul><li>The lead female Orc looks like they painted someone green and stuck halloween fangs in their mouth. A far cry from the detailed designs of the other orcs. Again, this is a leading character, so it is very jarring. This lack of coherency can be found all over the movie, as if they paid too much attention to some areas and totally slacked on others. Sometimes you'd go from a gorgeous CG render of a building exterior to what is clearly a prop interior.</li></ul><ul><li>Ultimately, though, the real problem is that the movie tries to do too much. It is so focused on setting up a franchise and establishing characters that it forgets to be a standalone movie experience. So it commits the ultimate movie sin: Warcraft is just confusing and boring.</li></ul>",4,1,2,15 October 2016
The Social Network," Smooth, smart yet shallow
","This movie deserved the accolades thrown on it. With a good script (penned by Aaron Sorkin, who breaks out of the habits that killed his previous show), nice pacing, smart acting and a few clever tricks, it tells the story of Facebook in convincing fashion. Proceedings are kept lean and smart: there are not too many characters and they are kept relatively uncomplicated. In fact, that might be the main criticism: for something dressed as a factual interpretation of events, it's all rather shallow. The main character has the most depth, but the rest more or less tumble into the situations they were designed for. In short, it lines up a lot of caricatures of people and them shoots them down in appropriate fashion. Near the end a character makes a comment that counters one of the opening lines in the movie: it's intentional and works if you don't think too much about it. But under close scrutiny it falls apart.That is the trick to this move: don't think too hard and it appears to be intelligent. But dig too deep and the whole saga seems a tad daft. Much like Facebook!",Null,0,0,4 November 2011
Alien: Covenant," Ham-fisted and pointless
","If your Alien movie features the classic alien for all of fifteen or so minutes, you have a problem. But when the preceding movie seems entirely devoted to mashing Prometheus into the Alien universe, it's a disaster.The problem is not that they try to mash the two together. It's just that it's done in such an unbelievably sloppy way, full of pointless exposition. I could hardly figure out who the characters were, yet somehow it was deemed important that I know who hooked up with who. Ridley Scott's recent tendency for over-stuffed character development is in full force here.This movie shouldn't be called Alien. It should be called David, as it is mostly about the creepy robots that the early films in particular used to great effect. None of it really adds up, not in the tradition of any of the previous movies, nor as a standalone experience.Would it have been so hard to just create a new Alien horror? Even the new game is scarier and better than this. And at least Prometheus, for all its stupidity, made a little sense.Alien Convenant is just a bunch of nonsense. Wait to watch it at home instead.",3,14,25,30 May 2017
