Requiem for a Dream," This is beauty.
","I could go on forever about this film -- it's truly amazing. The movie invokes so much feeling and truth that I feel so extremely depressed everytime I watch it -- and that's what makes it so beautiful. When a movie can change you mood and make you think, regardless of your current state, that's beauty. I'm glad Aronofsky directed this -- if you're happy with his work on 'Pi', you'll enjoy this film. If you enjoy strong movies that deal with addiction, in all shapes and forms, then this movie will touch you.",10,0,0,2 February 2003
Cube," Great story, B-Actors == pretty good film.
","This was a beautiful movie. The story was great, the directing was great, the acting... was.... *puke*. The only problem I had with this movie is the B-actors that were in it. The filmmakers apparently spent too much on the set design and not enough on the acting. If the cast were chosen better, I'd up my rating. This, however, should not keep you from seeing it -- it's one of those interesting flicks that everyone should take a gander at.",8,0,1,2 February 2003
