The Longest Yard," Now thats funny!
","I saw the longest yard in theaters when it first came out. If you want to laugh, you have to see this movie! If you want to cry, you just might, but only from laughing so hard! If your a pro wrestling buff, you're going to love Kevin Nash at the end of the movie! Quite a few Pro Wrestlers in the movie but no wrestling. Steve Austin, as well as Goldberg, and another one that I can't remember his name. Chris Rock is very good in this movie. Language isn't too bad, and of course Adam Sandler is great. Comparing it to some other movies of Adam Sandler on a scale of 1 - 5 five being real close to the greatness of this movie: 50 first dates - 2 : Billy Madison - 4 : Waterboy - 5 This is just a hilarious movie!! It comes out Sept. 20th, get it.Some critics don't agree with me, but you be the judge for yourself when you rent it, or buy it.",10,0,2,31 August 2005
