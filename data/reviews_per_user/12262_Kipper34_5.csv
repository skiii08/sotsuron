Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," It was not really so bad
","Honestly, I don't know why people are so bent about this movie. It was a fun popcorn matinee-style movie that has all the cool elements of the original trilogy. I personally enjoyed the frequent use of lightsabres in this movie, I thought that they weren't used as well in the original trilogy. There was a fair bit of location shooting and sets that were not just blue screens (The conveyor belt in AOTC!) Character development was shaky but, as Roger Ebert said, 'if you want non-stop character development, watch a Star Trek movie.' That and the lightsabre duel at the end was kickass. There's no way that this movie is as bad as people say, like Gigli. NOT THAT I'M COMPARING THIS MOVIE TO A BENNIFER FEATURE. sorry.",4,0,1,26 January 2004
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," I don't get it
","I fail to see what makes this so appealing. Way too over-the-top, bad screenplay. I didn't care what happened to any of these people, and the fights were not that mind-boggling. Some say that the Bride's battle with the Super 88 puts the Burly Brawl to shame, but that is simply not true. If you want a movie that does this kind of thing well, watch Crouching Tiger, because this movie blows. Dumb Dumb Dumb Dumb Dumb Dumb Dumb Dumb Dumb Dumb Dumb Dumb Dumb Dumb Dumb Dumb

Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," Good, but FELLOWSHIP was a more enjoyable adaptation
","This movie was incredibly good in its own sense, but being a complete nerd about these books, I have to say that the movie is woefully inadequate. Danial Radcliffe seems too wimpy for Harry Potter. He should be a little awkward but in this movie he's a complete pansy. All in all, it was a pretty good book to movie transition but it was not anywhere near as good as the Fellowship of the Ring",Null,0,0,8 October 2003
The Matrix Reloaded," Better than the first, but did anyone realize...
","This was one of the best sequels I have ever seen. THe fights were spectacular and the characters had much more depth than the last movie. Some have commented that it takes too long to get going, but I disagree. In the original Matrix, it's nothing but Neo waking up for half an hour straight and laurence fishburne talking with a weird smile and sitting in a crappy red chair. They talk a lot in this movie too, but what they say is interesting! IT answers so much that the other film left hanging. There were only two flaws that I could find: The awful sex scene during the rave (That really wasn't necessary). The other involved the car chase. NOw don't get me wrong; the chase itself was excellent and well-choreographed. But I realized about halfway through that all the cars they were using were made by GM. A twin shoots through a chevy tahoe, the cops all drove Chevy Impalas, and the agent jumps on an Oldsmobile Intrigue. The only non-GM car in the movie was the Audi A8 taht the Agents drove.",8,0,0,8 October 2003
Hart's War," Trying to do too much
","Hart's War was a very good novel but the movie was a bit of a disappointment because it tried to be too much. We have a plot similar to 'The Great Escape'. They're tunneling out of a German P.O.W. camp, albeit for different reasons. Second, we have 'To Kill a Mockingbird' where a black man is put on trial for a crime he did not commit. We also have a nice little bit from 'A Few Good Men' where Colin Farrell goes all 'Tom Cruise' on us and goes on a roll before the really stupid move of confessing that HE commited the murder, when in fact he didn't. Also, they crammed two characters into one. In the novel, the Commandant is Oberst von Reiter. There is the chief of security at the camp who is Hauptmann Heinrich Visser, who has only one arm. I think it was lazy for them to eleminate a key character and then give us a two-in-one guy who falls short of a good role. In short, read the book, you won't be sorry.",Null,0,1,9 December 2003
