Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Borat is possibly the funniest movie I have ever seen
","Being somewhat of a Borat fan (I've seen maybe a handful of Ali G episodes) I had high expectations for this movie. Rarely does a movie live up to expectations and this one surpassed my highest expectations. This movie takes an already hilarious character and put him in extremely hilarious situations. The theater crowd wasn't huge, but I have not heard a theater crowd laugh that hard in my entire life. If you can get past male nudity (which shouldn't be that offensive when you stop and think about it, seriously what is more offensive? watching someone get their head chopped off with a sword or a naked guy) and you like toilet humor this is definitely as good as it gets and possibly the best it has ever gotten.",10,3,14,12 November 2006
