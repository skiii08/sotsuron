Skyfall," so not Bond
","Maybe a good action movie but not a Bond! Action 8/10 Story 7/10, Directing 5/10 so overall I give 6/10.Director made a Batman like movie. By the way what a coincidence: Bond is orphan and his parents got a Manor somewhere in Scotland... and guess what Bond is the only spy in the world that kept his family name as we saw his parents grave! I liked the shower scene though just because it was so predictively Bond ;-) Xavier Bader 9/10 as usual the smartest villain on earth forget to close the door behind him :-o Directors, screen-writers, producers... grow up! Anyway mister Mendes, 'American Beauty' and 'Revolutionary Road' were and are out of class... don't get it, it surly pays the bill.",6,7,16,11 November 2012
