Blade Runner 2049," Pathetic. Blade Runner for the new generation is as flawed as any other modern Hollywood movie.
","The original Blade Runner was a film primarily about visuals, it was not surprising that in the early 1980s, Ridley Scott had no rival in the visual department. Blade Runner was mostly a visual movie, with little or no character development. It was a rich film about culture and visual aesthetics. The film was pioneer enough to influence several generations of filmmakers, but also about TV series, anime, among others about a futuristic look. In other words, the greatest strength of that film was to insert people in that visual. It is impressive, that Blade Runner influenced several generations, but Blade Runner 2049, does not influence anything. Nothing in the visual department captures the spectator's imagination. Denis Villeneuve fails roundly in this department, everything in 2049 is copied and recycled from other people's works. Here there is no imagination, but purely a copy. Blade Runner influenced, 2049 did not influence anything or anyone. I'll just say one example. The director of the film created a young Sean Young, using visual effects. Ironically, this has already happened in Terminator Salvation with Arnold Schwarzenegger. Another unnecessary sequel to a futuristic film with strong sci-fi elements made in the 80's.That brings up the question, who had the sad idea of creating a sequel to Blade Runner if you can not create something visually interesting and if the movie itself was a box office flop in 1982. The answer is simple, it's about the money. Nowadays in Hollywood, the studios are desperate to create franchises, which can attract people as if they were drug addicts, to go to the movies regularly. Warner Bros. already tried in 2015 with Mad Max Road Fury, and now tries to do with Blade Runner in 2017. It's all about money. Instead of trying to create something new, Hollywood studios try to create franchises, based on pre-existing films, because it's so much faster, easier and there's no financial risk. This is because movie budgets are constantly growing. And of course Blade Runner in its releases for home entertainment, whether on VHS, DVD or Blu Ray, has always had solid sales. Blade Runner was a hit on TV as well. Like The Shawshank Redemption or Fight Club, films such as Blade Runner were a box office flops, but hits in other media. People kept talking about these movies, even after they were released in theaters. You can not catch a lightning bolt twice in a row. This is because 2049 brings nothing new for people to talk about. It's a passable, forgettable film just for making money.This is why, Denis Villeneuve not only fails to create an interesting visual experience. As a film, Blade Runner 2049 crashes in all other departments. Not only that, but Blade Runner never needed a sequel. The story to tell was all told in the first film. Blade Runner never needed a sequel to expand the story, just as movies like Chinatown, L.A Confidential, or Casablanca don't need a sequel. In a sense, this film is almost a remake of the first, done in an amateur way in the sense of modern blockbusters. The film begins with an unnecessary setup between the characters Ryan Gosling and Dave Bautista. From that moment on, Denis Villeneuve began to put the typical gestures and mannerisms of modern movie scripts. I say of course, there has to be the unnecessary revolution/revolt against the system (the similarity that existed with The Matrix), but, unlike the original, everything here is in excess.
That is one of the biggest mistakes in the script of this film, is to transform a male film with a strong focus on sci-fi (sci-fi is not a genre that the female audience is interested) with useless dramatic elements. You know the same mistake that Denis Villeneuve did last year with Arrival, he had the audacity to do with the sequel of Blade Runner. Let's be clear, if I want a strong dramatic film, I see Schindler's List. If I want to see a male sci- fi, I see Aliens, Terminator or Blade Runner. Do not try to mix the two things Denis Villeneuve. The movie loses its tone. Not to mention, the silly lines of dialogue (and what you expected from the guy - Michael Green - who wrote Green Lantern), stupid I know. Despite that, the original film leaves room for the imagination about that universe and its characters (e.g: Jared Leto's character killing a replicant, just to make a point, or whatever). Who was the villain at the end of the first film, Deckard for doing his job or Roy Batty who killed people, however he wanted to live. In Blade Runner 2049, there is nothing to think about, everything is black and white.
This new film leaves no room for imagination, everything here is explained, as if it were an equation - at the end of the second act a character reveals to the character 'Joe/K' that he was not the chosen one (as in many other sci-fi films) and the end itself is only a generic twist and totally out of context (as in Arrival) with a character that appeared only one scene (but do not worry about, the obligatory third movie is already being planned) in the original Sean Young's character was quite a while before the end of the movie. In contrast the film has totally useless scenes that only serve to increase unnecessarily the extension of the film itself.I'm not going to write anything else, about this useless movie, that comment on the final battle between the characters of Ryan Gosling and Sylvia Hoeks. She also knows Kung-fu and says stupid one- liners ('I am the best' among many, or whatever). Trash lines of dialogue, we have here. To talk about the character of Sylvia Hoeks that does not reach the feet of Roy Batty. While in the original, the scene of the rain had a sense, because the character of Rutger Hauer wanted to live, this is why the scene is soon iconic. In this new movie there is one fight scene, just to look 'badass'. Once again, Hollywood had feminized a great and good villain into a woman to appeal to the female audience (say hello to Ghostbusters 2016). Not only that, the film treats women as sexual objects (the stupid hologram of the woman with pink hair), prostitutes or with violence. A film without its own identity, the film is not meat or fish. Incidentally, not even filmmakers know what they want.

Thor: Ragnarok," This movie failed in every possible level.
","I'm not a hater of comic book-based movies, and it is difficult, considering 2/5 of the movies that appear in movie theaters are based on comic book, if you want to see a movie with action and effects, in the end you always end up with one or another of this type of movie. Blame Hollywood and the mentality of wanting to get the milk from the cow in greater quantity in the shortest possible time.And this movie fails on almost every level, first, the movie begins with a set piece when Thor confronts a fire demon, before this, begins a monologue of this demon on Ragnarok. Honestly, who was the amateur puts such a big exposition before an action scene. And in the midst of these two things, Thor begins to make jokes about being attached to chains. Honestly the editing of this movie is horrible.And that goes for the whole movie. Another example, Odin ends up dying at the end of the first act, and soon afterwards appears an action scene with Hela. The public still barely chewed Odin's death scene - scene loses all emotional impact - a set piece appears which should have an emotional impact - the destruction of Thor's hammer - turns out to have no impact at all. Worse, both scenes lost their impact and ended up canceling each other out.The editing is so horrible, the pace is so fast that not only the emotional scenes lose their emotional focus, the action scenes are flawed and the suspense scenes do not work and the whole movie is gone down the drain, in which the movie can not be chewed and the movie looks like a Mcdonald's meal. Just a factory product. In addition, the film addresses the destruction of a civilization and a race - in this case Asgard - of such a simplistic manners, and in such a hurried way. This film needs (at least) 3 hours for development and make an satisfactory establish for the final battle (considering how many subplots this movie has), instead this is a 2 hours film of second-rate jokes.A movie to fill your eyes, but nothing is left in the mind and because of this movie is easily forgotten after the credits pass. Even the special effects are horrendous. The Hulk continues to be a digital doll and being made by a computer - what's the point of putting the Hulk in the film, but as a way to call more fanboys and sell more tickets, if the Hulk were not in the movie, this movie would make a smaller box-office and less money would went into Disney's account. Not to mention the big wolf, like the hulk, is a computer-made digital doll. The effects that should have been the decoy of the film are amateurs and lousy. Everything in this film fails. In other words, this movie as blockbuster fails to show grandiose special effects and action scenes, the movie fails at all levels. Look, I hate Avatar, but James Cameron knows how to make a great visual spectacle with great action scenes, a beautiful but empty movie. Thor 3 is rubbish at all levels, especially in its proposal (special effects and action scenes). And this for me this is the biggest sin of this movie, because this movie failed in all its objectives.",1,173,340,26 October 2017
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," The characters are too unrealistic and cartoonish to take this movie seriously. And this is the main problem of this movie.
","Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, should be a good movie, but the fact that the characters are too cartoonish and consequently these same characters become too unrealistic to be taken seriously. Of course Frances McDormand, did a good job as a violent mother. But Sam Rockwell and Woody Harrelson just did a nice job. Martin McDonagh is trying to impress the audience with fierce mannerisms, showing violence only by showing, and as a result he is trying to impress the male audience (audience is only interested in violence, instead of seeing a good story). In other words, the director was more interesting to create a movie full of violence, instead of creating a real drama with real characters and real and interesting conflicts, and an interesting film to see.
So, in the end, this movie is your typical movie to please a certain group, in this case police haters (that is to say), many movies are in the top of the IMDb, only because in the same movies there are scenes in which the characters can deceive the police or there are scenes in which a large number of policemen are killed - the scene of the mother setting fire to the police station, in this film will be a future classic, in the minds of many people, mark my words.We are not going to fool ourselves, a large number of the population hate the police and rightly so, many policemen abuse their position. But traumatized idiots, instead of getting over the traumas, they come here to give big scores to films like these, just to satisfy the vengeful wishes they have against the police.If this is not enough, director Martin McDonagh only puts scenes of violence just to generate more violence, and with that these scenes become unnecessary violence scenes, scenes of the dentist and the mother hitting teenagers in the genital organs. A police officer throws a citizen from the window of a building, the police chief sees this and only fires him. Seriously.What's the point of director Martin McDonagh? To prove that anger generates more anger, or violence generates more violence. At least he could put it in a more discreet way without the need for violent scenes. The effect he made was the opposite, because scenes of gratuitous violence only generate more violence in the streets. Amateur.Even, the humor element becomes too obvious that borders the ridiculous, the scene in which a police officer, talks to the violent mother after the accident at the dentist. The scenes of black comedy border on the stupid and tasteless aspect and completely misplaced. The midget scene is completely misplaced too and overly obvious (putting a black comedy scene between before a dramatic scene, really!!). And of course, the annoying monologue of Frances McDormand's character with the deer, about reincarnation. Predictable and too obvious. Or dog-shaped slippers scene is obviously, also annoying to see.
Not to mention that the movie script is full of ridiculous situations, bordering on the absurd. The mother in principle hates the police, because (stupid reason) is taking too long to find the culprit of rape and death of the daughter, then the mother becomes friends with a police officer, after she has seen that the same police officer (the same idiot, who throws a citizen from the window) risked his live to go get the paper process of the daughter in the back of the police station that was burning (fire put by the mother herself). Stupid and juvenile.This is the typical movie that ends where it started. In the end, the culprit of the crime was not caught, the mother is still violent (the mother was always violent, just see in the flashbacks, the discussions she had with her daughter) and she embarks on a journey to go hunting down a 'supposed' rapist, with the police officer than threw the man out the window. Idiot, I know.
I only give 2 stars, for the good performance of Frances McDormand, because she convinces me as a violent mother.",2,45,86,28 February 2018
Pacific Rim," What is the purpose of this film?
","Oh my....I thought the destruction in Man of Steel was gratuitous, meaningless and excessive, wait until you see this movie. The meaningless destruction of this film, makes the destruction of Man of Steel, look like a child's play in a park.Because taking away large-scale destruction and special effects (and I admit, the special effects in this movie are very good), this does not offer anything interesting, innovative, or at least something good and basic at least.The story is cliché, generic and predictable -checkThe actors do not know what they are doing (lost in the middle of the script), performances are forced and hollow-witches -checkMore chiché elements and characters that an old clothes - check (The Asian girl, who lost her parents in a monster attack in the past, with the help of the white guy, finally gets her revenge, the white character has to show that he is capable of doing the job done, even if all things are against him (the teen spirit -never give Up, if you try hard, you can have it), The tough black guy, but with a good heart and a good sense of duty. The stupid Nerd character that has to explain everything, etc, etc...Ron Perlman is here and he is annoying. The plot is predictable, the action scenes are confusing, the story and characters are chiché, the music goes unnoticed, the only interesting thing is the special effects and the action scenes. Which for me are not worth much. Special effects are in Film industry to help the storytelling, the special effects are not here to be the main attraction of the film or any film for that matter. The movie serves as a showcase for showcasing good special effects. The action scenes are good, but confusing.I do not recommend this movie, waste of time.",1,2,5,1 January 2017
Baby Driver," A mixture of a film that sometimes works and sometimes don't
","I recently watched the new Edgar Wright movie - Baby Driver. And I can say Edgar Wright's great passion for cinema by placing so many references into this movie with 'parts' of his favorite films. But when the references become the film itself, the film loses identity and becomes just a collage without personality, being thus a inferior movie to the films that inspired it. There are so many references to other movies that this ends up getting annoying to watch the movie itself. References to Heat, Goodfellas, Bonnie and Clyde, Ronin and many other movies. Stuck in your face almost all the time. A hassle.Yet, there are good times here, especially stylized action. But the characters were written in a stupid and chiché way, who in the third act, apart from Baby and Debora, the audience loses interest in the characters (it is irrelevant if the characters die or live) .Especially the character of Eiza González - Darling, who in one scene, throws herself forward into an entire police squadron just to get shot stupidly and just to give the script a reason for her boyfriend, Buddy to go after Baby and Debora and want revenge for the death of his stupid girlfriend. A cheap motive to start the third and final act of the film (which only has violence and zero intelligence in the script of the film). Yes the movie is loaded with stupid moments, like the personality change of Kevin Spacey's character. That character throughout the movie has a cold relationship with Baby and when the script needs him to help Baby escape from Buddy, magically he changes his personality and he decides to help Baby. Just for the plot convenience.Yet the chemistry between Baby and Debora and the good acting of Jon Hamm, Ansel Elgort and Lily James helps to keep the interest in the film until the ending (and give me a reason not to only give 1 for this movie). Even counting the stupid moments of the characters, the exchanges of personalities of these same characters, the badly applied clichés, unnecessary violence and the excess of references to other films on the part of Edgar Wright. Interesting to see once, but I will hardly ever see this movie again for the film itself and not for the countless and unnecessary references.",4,2,4,16 August 2017
Man of Steel," Nothing new here to see
","Because Superman 78 was a success in the past, all Superman movies after that movie have to live in the shadow of such an event?Superman Returns was basically a remake of the first, done in a stupid way (apparently director Bryan Singer was more interested in the physical aspect of the previous Superman, than creating a good movie).This new Superman movie basically has the same premise as Returns, the big difference is instead making a pseudo remake of the first one, Man of Steel is a remake of the first two movies. The big difference between them, is Superman 06, Lois Lane has an illegitimate child (but Lois walks with another man, to take advantage of his financial condition - When the real parent is not present). In this new Superman movie, Superman is a psychopath, who by influence of the earthly father, he lets people die or in the fights he has, the collateral damage has to be in the millions. Both movies are stupid, by the way.The first half of the movie, in which Clark has his origin revealed (same with Superman 78), he learns how to deal with his powers and find Lois. And he becomes the protector of the earth. The second half, he confronts the Kryptonian general, whose aim is to turn the earth into New Kryton (same with Superman 2, 1980) wonderful, the filmmakers, are not even try anything new this time, differently from what happened 30 years ago in theaters. Pure laziness or project completely controlled by the studio, choose the worst option. If there is no desire to create something unique, innovative or at least interesting, what is a massive budget of 225 millions for? What they will do? Exactly, create a project as hollow as a jar. The special effects for the great battles of destruction, in which the characters are close to indestructible and invincible, fighting each other until the duration of the film reaches the end and the plot needs a conclusion.You can start saying goodbye to all the suspense in the action scenes, without that there was not much already, because this is a super hero movie and the hero has to win and be alive at the end (and Warner and the producers have to make a profit on selling toys and action figures to children and adults who refuse to grow).This movie is not much different from the Superman movie released in 2006, the only difference is that this movie is full of destruction scenes to appeal to Transformers fans. We have the same casting mistakes here (Henry Cavill, more like a dummy, or better Super Wooden man - only with two expressions the whole movie), Michael Shannon as General, just screams and does not nothing in the story, Any Adams is completely lost in the script.At least in Superman '78, the filmmakers knew what they wanted and how they wanted to do it. Here the filmmakers are just doing the job in the pipeline (or the studio sends it), because this franchise is famous, and it is a great opportunity to make money and fame faster. The people here are not making art, they're here to do factory work. This movie here, even fails as Blockbuster of entertainment, this movie even fails even as a mere fun movie. (Back to the Future and Jaws, examples, movies that have been successful in this area of course).A crooked film, the same thing seen dozens of times, without ambition, meaningless to give innovation, and especially without confidence in the project itself. Twenty years from now, when the special effects of destruction get old, someone will come here to see this stupid movie, And he will understand why this 'movie' is more raunchy than a Pyrex. This is why the filmmakers want to make a product and not a film centered on the story and characters. And of course there are innumerable opportunities, If they would go that way, but they chose the first path. They chose the path what countless other products that make successful on the box-office, because of that the result was this tripe.What a waste of time.For any intelligent person except the fanboys. But who can be a fan of Superman, Why? Because in the last 35 years, all the movies have been crap.",1,7,12,30 December 2016
The Thing," A Good Movie.
","The film's proposal is similar to Alien's (1979) proposal: a group of people have contact with an alien being, someone gets infected and then it's a hunting game between cat and mouse.What I like about movies in the 80's is that filmmakers do not waste time with unnecessary things and go right to the point. There is no mystery here. A human among the group gets infected and the group has to know who became infected.Killing the Thing in the process, it is therefore necessary. Unlike Alien, The Thing tries to create an atmosphere of mistrust in the team, and this raises doubts, creating for this a great aspect in the narrative of the film, to see the human distrusting of each other between the group companions raises the tension to the limits. The tension of the film is constant and the characters are friendly enough so we want to know about them. Be concerned about their fate is good enough to care about these characters.The filmmakers do not try to put any political messages, nor do they want to manipulate the audience. It's a great and straightforward horror movie with sci-fi to mix. It is a survival movie at its best. Unlike Arrival, who tries to pass the message that we have to unite (all nations), otherwise We will not survive. There is something greater here in this movie. A great movie to have fun in the sense of the old B-movies, but also it does not forget that our most basic instinct is survival and when we unite, forgetting our differences (as a group of Individuals, not nations), for the sake of our survival and our well-being, the human race shines in the most intense sense possible. The cooperation between several elements, to come out alive from a complicated situation. No political messages or no unnecessary melodramas (aka Interstellar).I just think the ending was a bit rushed, and needs some more focus on the final elements (characters) of the group. But the filmmakers went straight into the action and the big explosions, unlike Alien, where the tension accelerates to the very end and never stops. On the contrary it accelerates and increases. In this case, I consider Alien a superior film to The Thing (1982). Nonetheless, this movie is still a great horror movie with sci-fi elements, which makes it a great survival film. It's a great film to have some fun.",6,4,6,23 December 2016
North by Northwest," Disappointment. But still a good movie to watch
","When he went to Hollywood, Alfred Hitchcock made the movie Rebecca, which cost just over $ 1 million, and had a good box office run. Alfred Hitchcock just wanted to sell a ticket for the people to enjoy a good movie in a good section. After Rebecca, Mr. & Mrs. Smith also had success with the public, however it was with Strangers on a Train, Dial M for Murder, The Man Who Knew Too Much, Vertigo and obviously Rear Window that Hitchcock had its biggest hits in his Hollywood career until the mid-50's. With that Alfred Hitchcock gained a lot of strength within Hollywood, and he got a big budget for this movie, North by Northwest. North by Northwest was another commercial project that Alfred Hitchcock embraced in focus in the espionage. North by Northwest was successful at the box office, but it was not on the same wavelength as his previous projects, which I mentioned here, especially Rear Window, and the film did little more than double its own budget. So Alfred Hitchcock returned to Psycho on a more modest budget.North by Northwest, it's a good movie. It has a good suspense, the direction is very good by Alfred Hitchcock, and the performances are solid, especially Eva Marie Saint, who is perfect here. The great sin of this movie, for me, are the characters of this movie. Considering the important ideas and techniques that Alfred Hitchcock developed that could fill some books. I always expected more from this project. The problem with this film is how some of these characters were written, in this department I particularly blame Ernest Lehman. Ernest Lehman, wrote the characters in an amateur way, in which these same characters do not look anything like humans when confronted with the same situations that appear in the film. Particularly the scene with the mother of the main character, when she confronts one of the 'supposed' hijackers in an elevator. From this moment, I completely lost the notion of a film with a serious focus. And to be honest, the characters surround the comedy tone many times and in many situations, particularly in some situations with the main character at a mid-train station. From that moment, I completely lost interest in this film, and I just went to look at the movie just to pass the time. And waiting for the movie to end. For a film that wanted to be serious, and this was its initial proposal with the public, the movie was loses much coherence as a film. It was a disappointment, for me.",7,1,6,19 November 2017
Dunkirk," Christopher Nolan created an impressive blockbuster on World War 2, with the focus on survival.
","The most important lesson in the history of our humanity, surpassed in genre, religion among other moral aspects, is simply the survival of the species or a human being in question. Our most basic instinct is survival and when we unite, forgetting our differences (as a group of Individuals, not nations), for the sake of our survival and our well-being, the human race shines in the most intense sense possible. The cooperation between several elements, to come out alive from a complicated situation. One scene, caught my attention when a group of Allied soldiers were surrounded in a ship and this same ship was being attacked on all sides by the German troops. One of the characters was being forced out of the ship to see if the tide sea was rising or not. Out of fear, this character did not want to leave the ship, it was when an English soldier replied: for the others to survive, one person has to die.The theme of this film is survival, especially surviving in a difficult situation, is in itself a great victoryNothing is better expressed in this film and executed in a way with as much talent as Nolan achieved in making with this film. Not only by itself, the message is passed to the audience in a clear and perfect way as is demonstrated in small scenes that help convey this message and build a fitting end to the film itself.The film goes straight to the narrative and action of the movie without losing in passing with interesting monologues, unlike Inception, a film in which Nolan himself created a character with the sole purpose of explaining the rules of this universe for the audience, this is the apex of Nolan as a Film director and he performs his work in a simple and exemplary way. So Dunkirk is his smaller commercial movie, but with the bonus without unnecessary scenes that could crumble the experience of the film.The performances are excellent and accompany the director's talents (the direction of the film itself) and the script in a cohesive, simple and direct way, highlighting Fionn Whitehead, Mark Rylance and of course the very competent Kenneth Branagh. These excellent actors help immerse the audience in the cinematographic aspect of the movie itself to make the experience as real and emotional as possible.Again, congratulations to Nolan for choosing actors relatively unknown to the general public, but outstanding in their work of acting. Instead of trying to choose famous actors (whose private lives are always in the mouths of the people and the magazines), these people are celebrities and not actors. For this reason I never managed to pass the first act of Saving Private Ryan. Spielberg made a mistake filling his film with the most popular Hollywood All Star cast of famous actors at that time (their lives were so exposed that it was hard to see those people as soldiers or survivors of WWII). At this point, Nolan fared better than Spielberg.By completing this great experience, special and sound effects are applied in an exemplary way and these same technologies make almost perfect use of the IMAX screen. The technical and aesthetic aspects are very good, as it comes this habit in this type of film with this type of budget (105 millions). The cinematography is very good (almost perfect, like in most of Nolan movies) and the camera movements are agile and very beautiful.See the aerial combat of the characters of Tom Hardy (Farrier) and Jack Lowden (Collins) in aerial planes that looked with great and amazing beauty in fighting against the planes of the Germans. A technical amazing work of Nolan and his production team. Amazing, no doubt. Especially on the IMAX screen, where the film shows all its beauty, and if there is a movie that deserves to be seen in IMAX, it is one, this new work of Christopher Nolan, no doubt. The ambitious ideas of the filmmaker and the great sequences in parallel assembly that characterize his works. Making the storytelling move to viewers in three different locations (The Mole, The Sea and The Air). In a cohesive, precise and confusing way. This film shows a great talent of Nolan, and it reaches his talent to create sequences in parallel assembly the characters of the film in a brilliant way. The soundtrack composed by the veteran Hans Zimmer is amazing, Hans in turn creates a memorable theme for the theme of World War II. Fantastic and great.The great and only problem I see that disturbs the experience of the film is limited by the PG-13 and thus limit the blood and violence, for God's sake, it is a film about a war blood and violence are common. At times it seemed like I was looking at some scenes and these same scenes seemed so artificial and displaced from the film itself, like the scene of the soldiers corpses coming to the beach, or the English troops being smashed by the sinking ship (two clear examples that PG-13 influenced negatively the movie).One problem that some people go through seeing this movie is the lack of depth in some characters, however there are characters with depth, but not the kind of depth shown through dialogues or exposition. Nolan wanted to show something bigger. And I think Nolan did it. Nolan created in this movie to show the question of survival and its consequences in the lives of the people close to war and the soldiers who were fighting in that war. He wanted to show us how and survival define us, and I think he got the message very well across this movie. Even for this, he sacrificed some dramatic depth. Depth for certain characters, however Nolan passed a larger message, which surpasses any dramatically deep element. Nolan wanted to get something bigger. And in my opinion he did it.",8,164,314,22 July 2017
Elysium," Technically astonishing, yet passable and quickly forgotten
","I like the beginning of this movie, the sequences editing, the camera plans are very good and the mix with the sound is great.And the satellite orbiting around the earth, and that shows the localized society as if it was a mirror is very beautiful.But this is the problem, for this film and other modern sci-fi. Underneath this amazing technical aspect, it is the same with the same plot and story seen so many times. Just to end up giving you a moral lesson and show great special effects.In this case, the difference between rich and poor, poor live below, on the unclean planet, and rich in the upper world and full of opportunities. The world has become chaos because of overpopulation, and of course the corrupt and bad company is also here. That put the profit above the poor, for the rich to live well and with quality. Of course, these topics and themes already seen a million times don't help at all. Since the script is a mess. Who cares about creating a good story, if the filmmakers only want to create situations to show scenes that evolve the amazing special effects. Once again the special effects are in Film industry to help the storytelling, the special effects are not here to be the main attraction of the film or any film for that matter.The main problem is not only the story be a huge chichÃ©, but the execution is also done poorly with way too cold characters at the mix. Besides that, I think the biggest problem with this movie is the script that does not let the actors shine. But to tell you the truth, the actors don't even try hard, it seems they are in the movie, only to receive the paid check and nothing else. Matt Damon as tormented person, and no one is convinced. Jodie Foster is on autopilot for the entire movie. And William Fichtner is an annoyance to see, playing the traditional jerk of any movie of the this movie. The action scenes are passable and quickly forgotten. A waste, that served only to show great technical quality (special effects, sound, etc). But for this, We do not need talent, but a great budget. To create a good movie and a good story requires talent, dedication, and hard work. And this movie has none of it. A waste of time.",2,1,4,18 January 2017
Avatar," A film that served to show just special effects
","That's a lot for me to do an analysis of this movie, I saw in theaters in 2009 and I liked. By saw this movie recently with a closer look and I was surprised this movie try not to amaze the person with a story that can be guessed after the first 15 minutes. Apparently James Cameron, was more interested to build a universe in which he could launch several consecutive films and try to profit from inside and outside the theaters. The extremely limited characters in the third act, and many of them ending in a chiché outcome make the most painful experience in the final moments of the movie even worse. Only to be seen as technological curiosity, as they were the best special effects in 2009 and nothing more.",5,3,5,7 April 2016
American Made," There are certain things that should stay in the 80's.
","And Tom Cruise is one of them.Let's be honest here. Tom Cruise has never been a good actor, he just got where he is now due to contacts, his agency and especially physical aspect, to attract women and girls. He is a real drip. Whose only good performances is the good-looking hero who said good one-liners (Mission Impossible - a franchise that Hollywood created on purpose only to increase his ego, in which he is the only relevant character there), or the patriarch service, scenes of Tropic Thunder, are the perfect example what he does well, a guy who likes to be the boss and abuse women and employees.Now with this pathetic movie, someone wants to convince me that Cruise can play Barry Seal, a guy who gets out in front of the government, a Latino drug cartel, drug barons, CIA, FBI or more than a thousand and one things yet to be made or discovered by man. Hell no. If someone at Hollywood want to make a convincing Barry Seal, bring someone with the caliber of Josh Brolin. That would give this project even more credit. And who had the sad idea to make Cruise the narrator of this film. I hate this one-liner, I'm the only guy, who always delivers. I do not even remember half the movie. The way the film is so bad structurally.But Tom Cruise is not the only flaw in this project (this project was born crooked at birth). The movie itself was never taken seriously. What do you expect from a movie coming out after the summer season? A serious film about a serious subject, with a good script and a good acting? No way. The movie is full of useless sex jokes typical of larger-budget films from Hollywodd, the Tom Cruise scene having sex with his wife in the cockpit of the plane is ridiculous or Tom Cruise's character constantly showing the 'butt'- It's deplorable, I know. Or male jokes like Tom Cruise facing 100 or more Hispanics with a baseball bat. Incompetent scene.The direction of the film is flawed, the pace is horrendous, there are some scenes too long, or some too short. The acting is too fake, especially on the part of Jayma Mays (the most unbelievable justice solicitor, I have ever seen) and Sarah Wright (the windy head, annoying, generic woman of Barry Seal).Holes in the script (no one has remembered the corpse of the useless brother of the wife of Barry Seal, the police in this film is really useless and unprepared, by the way).Not to forget how this film treats the people of Latin America, whose only humans that appear in the film, are drug dealers, murderers or pornography lovers. Or the people of Mena, that this film represents as useless morons from the countryside. What a useless and terrible movie we have here. Someone burns this movie as fast as possible. I would not recommend it to anyone.",1,52,116,8 September 2017
Kong: Skull Island," Sorry, there is no king here.
","King Kong (1933) was a perfect movie in its proposal. A simple, direct and clear message. No remakes or sequels required. This is why all sequels and remakes are always inferior in impact to the original. Filmmakers always want to add anything new and unnecessary. In this new film, Kong leaves the territory of quality and embarks on a trip to the territory of blockbusters, in other words, special effects and jokes (just watch the retarded and unnecessary joke scene about the Skullcrawlers name with Hiddleston, Larson and John C. Reilly) overlap the story, and so the film is passable and totally forgettable in a week.Once again, Hollywood treats scientists as idiots when the character of Corey Hawkins can not even open a can of canned food and feels intimidated by a woman. Not to mention the macho colonel, who wants an unnecessary revenge with Kong, because Kong killed his men (in a casual meeting).And not to mention the idiotic plans that Jordan Vogt-Roberts uses to focus the eyes of the Samuel L. Jackson character with the eyes of King Kong. It seems like the director Jordan Vogt-Roberts wants to make a kind of (unnecessary) fight in the old west style. Pure waste of time, as we know that the macho colonel, is no challenge for Kong, so why waste precious screen time with these situations? Because Kong's story can be told as in the original in just 90 or 100 minutes. And the filmmarkers have to put 2 hours of film and for this they have to put unnecessary situations and scenes. As the disposable soldier of the colonel, who gets lost from the group, just to see Kong crush a giant squid (and then Kong eats it), then after some scenes, be killed by another giant monster. What could be an interesting conflict between the characters of Tom Hiddleston and Samuel L. Jackson, but that ends up in nothing. Because people are written from a stupid one-dimensional way (like the stupid macho colonel). That is, more movie time, for less story. This is because Kong never leaves the island in this movie, Kong will only leave the island in 2020 in the movie Godzilla vs. King Kong. Yes this movie aims to create another shared universe (MCU type of crap), and in the end this compromises the quality of this film. The filmmakers have their hands tied, because they can not put their best on this film, however they have to think how this movie will work with another movie from another guy, three long years into the future.I went into the movie hoping to see a good and fun Kong movie, and I ended up seeing a crap and bad one, because of the ambition of the studio that compromised the quality of the movie, for the money. Not to mention, even as a fun movie, this movie fails so much. You see, the scenes with special effects, you can see that the scenes were all filmed on a green screen. And the final fight between Kong and the giant lizard is even inferior to the T-rex fights in Peter Jackson's 2005 remake. Yes, the fights and clashes between Kong and the other giants monsters were better, bigger, more epic, more brutal and vicarious than in this pathetic 2017 movie. I'm not defending the Peter Jackson movie, that film obviously had its flaws, but in the department of special effects and action scenes (this department that does not save a movie, nonetheless) is vastly superior to this Jordan Vogt- Roberts movie. Even as an action movie and blockbuster, this movie fails in a big way.But if you were disappointed, and if you were sad that you had lost money unfairly, you can wait until 2020 to see the rest of the film in Godzilla VS King Kong.My God, that's why commercial filmmaking is in the mud. The commercial cinema has as main target children, teenagers and young people. And this is why the quality bar is so low.",1,205,407,17 March 2017
Inception," Didactic, but nonetheless a good movie.
","Inception has a problem that I cannot bear: the constant that someone comes to explain the laws and how that world works. The creation of the character of Ellen Page (Ariadne) was for the sole purpose of explaining that to moviegoers. Not that it's bad, but at certain moments it seems like the movie becomes more class at school, to know how that universe works, instead of the characters in this movie live the adventure for themselves. In this aspect the film is didactic. And the space for the imagination is limited. In this aspect everything in this film is chewed, everything explained, where are the possibilities? I do not want someone to explain the universe, I want to see the characters live and react in this universe.Yes the ending leaves open the question whether that is a dream or reality, but it is a cheap gimmick instead of letting them our imaginations fly. If at the end of the movie the experience of the characters was a dream, so it was waste of two and a half hour, at least the Matrix shows the characters in the real world, and that it was not a dream inside a dream. The tension and time invested would not be a waste of time Not that it spoils the experience of the film, but it disturbs in some parts, mainly in the middle of the film, when the group is preparing for the assault. The concept is good, but it should be presented in a simpler way. Clearly Nolan was very ambitious in the concept of this film. But Nolan is quite integral in the proposal of his films, and he tries to put unknown concepts to the general public in such a cohesive way, even with the problem of trying to explain everything and other problems of pace are easily forgiven. Nolan tries to do his best in each of his films as if his movie was his last, as if his life depends on it. A great honesty on the part of Nolan, and this I can and I want to enjoy. Nolan is such an honest guy and scores points with me. It's the difference between the lousy movie director and an excellent director. The bad elements of Inception are not enough to spoil its qualities. The ambitious ideas of the filmmaker and the great sequences in parallel assembly that characterize his works. Not that the idea of Inception is innovative, this idea has been copied many times in other works (Paprika, Synecdoche New York and The Matrix are the most practical and common examples). But it's the way Nolan puts these ideas in the big budget blockbuster. Let's be honest here. Smaller or lower budget films are not seen by the general public due to the absence of of large production values (a great soundtrack, great locations for filming or great special effects, etc). See these ideas or concepts in a great Hollywood blockbuster made with such quality and care, it is amazing. And these ideas are embedded in the drama of the film in such a cohesive and exemplary way; it is applauding Nolan's professional integrity. This is why Nolan movies are so well received, he tries to put in these Hollywood blockbusters something more, something common in indie or smaller films, but with the financial aspect of the great studios to provide a better technical quality.Obviously there is quality on this movie; the large parallel sequences are exemplary. The parallel between the Van sequences, the hotel with the Joseph Gordon-Levitt (when character is awake in the elevator), the peak at the military base in the snow and the desolate city of Cobb and Mal is almost perfectly made with an all- encompassing soundtrack. Of course the sequences of action are lousy . And many dialogues are very weak. Two weaknesses in Nolan's movies.Bad things come with the good things. I suspect that the bad action scenes of Inception and Dark Knight were the reason why Nolan turned DKR into an action movie instead of trying to tell a good story, Nolan's ego should have been hurt by the criticism as he directs his action scenes in these two films. Particularly Inception and the action sequence in the snow with Tom Hardy. Too bad, sorry.But the performances are amazing, particularly Marion Cotillard as Mal. There are many layers in the various characters which Nolan conducts with mastery and the way they are inserted into the film is almost perfectly. Particularly in the initial sequence (which I thought would be a scene to showcase special effects, and Nolan proved me wrong). Or in the scene between Ariadne and Cobb, when Cobb tries to explain how his wife dies, and then discovered new layers of the character to reveal that in fact, he did have to do with the death of his wife. Of course this will be important to the outcome of the film. It is this ability to put the scenes and the flashbacks in certain key moments of the plot that Nolan shows much quality, and one of his long lists of virtues. Inception is a movie like any movie; it has its flaws, but also its virtues. But, for me the qualities overlap the defects, and in the end the movie is well worth watching. But is its legendary statute being worthy? If Inception was released in the 1980's would it have the same impact in that decade, as it had in 2010? Currently the commercial movies in Hollywood are in crisis. We live in an era of remakes, superhero movies and franchise fatigue without the studios or directors making an effort to improve with originality or at least with a little more original concepts. Inception's credit could be lower if today's Hollywood was not in such a decadent state. But nonetheless, Inception is still a good movie.",9,14,23,30 December 2016
Arrival," Too much drama, not enough sci-fi elements.
","Arrival follows the same line of sci-fi movies that in recent years has infected Hollywood. The studios hold up known actors (we know how they will react or act in each situation - to ensure a fat box- office), a director known to the general public and who has a few well received films on the critics, and try to create these supposed sci-fi movies very close to the scientific aspect of science and reality. But without ever representing science or scientists as they really are. Putting thus absurd ideas, nothing to do with reality, and in the middle of the film, transform it into a drama (sometimes in a melodrama - Interstellar), in order to try to manipulate the audience, emotionally.Arrival is the other of this new sci-fi wave, it is beautifully photographed, with great special effects, excellent soundtrack (which does not represent the quality of the technical team at all, only that the director and the producers have a big budget to spare at will), but in the background these new movies are not sci-fi movies in any aspect.But things are starting to fall in the last act of the film, when filmmakers have to appeal to the emotional side. How can you make a movie about an alien invasion, and in the middle of the movie, turns it into a drama? That is right, because of that there is not enough tension, and the movie fell into the middle. The sci-fi elements are few and far between. The sci-fi aspect of the film simply disappears, and the film itself becomes a basic drama with a political aspect of not offending anyone. At the end of the film the main character convinces a political leader in such a simple way, without proof. Not only that, but the Aliens aspect also bothers, the aliens do not even look like aliens, but sea squid and use oil to communicate, is this a joke.This movie has more holes than a Swiss cheese. Seriously, a soldier tries to explode with the spot where the aliens appear every eight hours, after seeing a t.v. report on the TV show. Such an important act and then this same character left the narrative of the film, after provoking an event as important as an explosion, without any explanation. A feather, an annoyance without size. I do not recommend. This movie will certainly be a hit at the 2017 Oscar. Because of the message of the Political correctness that this film tries to pass.",4,50,113,10 December 2016
Blade Runner," Firstly, and above all a visual experience
","I saw it for the first time, it was in 1996. It was the version released in 1982, I think it was that year, so in this review, I'll talk about this version made that year, because it was the first version that I saw. So to write a review, I will report the first experience.I saw it for the first time and I was amazed at the visual department of the movie. A harmonious blend, with an exemplary cinematography. Incidentally, I was not the only one, because Blade Runner influenced countless people. It's a unique case where a quality of the film stands out more, which marks the film forever and the general public gets this impression. Blade Runner, and above all, a visual experience with little or no element of drama. It's a visual experience, and if people want to take advantage, they should leave that aspect aside. This is the highest quality of the film, the ability to enter the audience in a cohesive way in that universe and live a visual experience. It's like most sci-fi movies of the 80's, a movie with strong male influences. That is, you will get here, scenes of violence and some nudity to the mix. But Ridley Scott, controlled himself and did not let the train out of the line. Yes, you also have here the evil corporation, but it was done in a more discreet way possible. no exaggeration, of course This is the big difference between a mediocre director and a good director, having a good self-control. Putting things in your movie at random is too banal and mediocre.The characters were well written, though Scott could not take much advantage of the great actors he had. Ridley Scott always had the problem of not being able to take 100% of the juice of the actors and put human emotions in his works, even in dramas (e.g. G.I Jane). But in this film, Rutger Hauer managed to put a lot of juice himself, especially in the third act, in the confrontation with Rick Deckard, which left the scenes excellent and striking like a great character. In the end, the film does not need much drama element, because there is something bigger here. An exploration, a discovery, that goes beyond the dramatic element. I think Ridley Scott got this great virtue. You get to get interested in the movie, even though it has very little character depth. This is because Scott, is primarily a visual director. There was not in the early 80's, director with better imprint for the visual department. And this for me, is a mark of success. You have difficulty in a job, however find other ways to overcome this same job or task. It is a high quality and a proof of great capacity. As the great director that Scott is, he finds it difficult to achieve characters' depths and achieve human emotions. He was able to create an experience almost 100% depth only with a single department, in this case the visual experiment. But let's be realistic, cinema is primarily a visual art. And like a visual work, Blade Runner is perfect at what it set out to do.In addition to the timeless visual aspect of the film, Scott was able to insert an exemplary sound aspect that further helps the viewers to be inserted into the film in an exemplary and cohesive way. The soundtrack is almost perfect for this kind of movie, strong and simple. But very well built. The dialogue is also well written in this film. In spite of many clichÃ©s and typical of the 80's, it ends up disturbing the experience a little, but it does not end with the experience of the film, but it hampers a bit in the final balance of the film. This is the proposal of this film, and if the film itself is consistent with its proposal, why not consider the film, a good movie. In the end, if you can overcome, the lack of dramatic element and depth of the characters, and the typical characteristics of the male productions. You will find here a great experience to live. Even for the present day, a unique experience in its own kind.",8,2,3,7 October 2017
Life," Nothing more than a Alien Rip off, with an absurd ending
","Last night I've seen 3 movies in theaters, Life (2017) was one of them. To my surprise, this film was made by Daniel Espinosa. And I was even more surprised that Mr. Espinosa did not try to make this movie a sci-fi drama as has been usual in Hollywood for the past few years. So what to expect from this movie? Firstly, the technical and aesthetic aspects are very good, as it comes this habit in this type of film with this type of budget. The cinematography is very good and the camera movements are agile and very beautiful. Daniel Espinosa's direction is interesting (at least in most of the film).In other words in the technical department the film is very good. You can have a beautiful movie visually, but a movie needs a good story and good characters if it want to be a good movie ten years (or more) from now. The problem is that the script is fragile (one example, the Earth sends a spacecraft to push the station into space fearing that the contamination hits the Earth if the station falls on the planet, after a few minutes after this scene, this information is completely forgettable by the script) and full of holes, the story is way too simple and some acting is very bad. To start with, I've never liked Ryan Reynolds, he's a bad actor and his character is annoying, I think the director got this idea and because of this, Ryan Reynolds's character is the first to die (thank God). What a annoying and uninteresting character we got here. To tell the truth the actress Olga Dihovichnaya could have done a better work with her character (Ekaterina Golovkina). Her acting was very bad. The other actors are fine, however they needed more time to work on their characters (most of the blame is because of the stupid script). Especially the character of Jake Gyllenhaal.Some lines of dialogue said by the actors are also very stupid (example the character of Jake Gyllenhaal agrees to commit suicide to prevent 'Calvin' of contaminating the planet, because according to him, it is not worth living with these 8 billion stupid humans and he wants to stay in space is better for his life - ridiculous, I know).But the biggest problem of the film is that the film is just a poorly made copy of Alien (1979). Yes, Hollywood copies another classic movie, this time - the Ridley Scott classic sci-fi and horror movie. But the this film can not maintain the intensity, nor the pace nor the amazing construction until the very end that the film of Ridley Scott has. What's more, the movie is full of stupid moments. One of the most stupid moments was the camera moves to the first person (too see through the eyes of the creature) when 'Calvin' flies inside the station. What is the purpose of this? The only thing that comes to my mind, is the director wants to do these scenes to appeal to video game fans who play Call of Duty and other FPS? Ridiculous. Yes this movie is the Alien for the new generation that likes games and consoles and the same generation that likes to see blood and violence gratuitously to satisfy the ego.What a lousy movie we have here, the icing on the cake and the absurd and unnecessary ending. In Alien (1979), the ending was a perfect construction from start to finish of the movie, here the director Daniel Espinosa puts only this ridiculous ending to give the air of the film wants to be different from the other sci-fi movies that currently exist in the market. That is, a different ending just for the sake of being different and not according to the purpose or construction of the narrative. In other words, an absurd, unnecessary and irrelevant ending.Do not waste your money and your time watching this absurd movie.",1,46,92,25 March 2017
Deadpool," Being a different Super hero Movie does not mean it's good Movie overall
","Where will I get a hundred words to describe this 'movie'? The story of this movie is basically a revenge story in a superhero movie, clichÃ©. The reason for the success of this film is the type of character (which most Male audience in the age range between 16 and 25, will enjoy) coupled with spontaneous humor and the jokes with the fourth wall. Of course, the character may be a snort of fresh air for the sub genre super heroes (I do not know there was a sub-genre so-called Super hero/ comic movie genre), but for the movies in general, this here is nothing new to see. Do fans of this kind of movies feel down, when we talk about superhero movies and why do they have to separate them from the 'other' types of movies? Just because they do not to offend sensitivities? Or they do not want the audience to consider them a 'inferior movie', so many questions, no answer.Of course here we have all the ingredients that anyone in this range will like. Meaningless violence, even more so with super heroes. Seriously, how to create tension in a film of this type, where the main character has regeneration and if he is cut into pieces, it will regenerate. The action scenes (the most basic element of this type of film) completely lose their impact and tension. I like scenes of action and violence, but the filmmakers have to show the effects of violence on the bodies of characters and its consequences in characters' lives.. Creating violence just to show that it is 'cool' only creates more violent people. Even focusing solely on this aspect of the film, the film is too stupid. With senseless action scenes. This film, even its most primary purpose, can not perform with quality. In addition to the humorous, mindless action scenes, generic plot, the main character (fun but limited), what does this movie have to offer?Scenes of nudity, spare me. Do not waste your time with this tripe.",1,47,97,31 December 2016
Mad Max: Fury Road," Stupid movie.
","I really like the second Mad Max movie, it's pretty interesting and the atmosphere is unique, I am a fan of that movie. Mad Max Road Fury, it's just Mad Max 2 on the highway chase scene, but augmented. If it were just this, Road Fury would just be a passable and forgettable action movie. But director George Miller had the sad idea of transforming a series of action films with male focus, in a propagandist feminist product. Not that I have anything against feminists, but it's wrong for you to turn something that your fans like and turn into something different. Any defense that this movie may have, falls to the ground. The defenders of this film generally claim that the film no longer makes any political comment to the feminist side, and the film goes on to value that both sexes are equal at the beginning of the third act, since Mad and Furious (and the other women) work together to get saved from the pursuit of Immortan Joe. It would be true, but the way it is done, it's too simple and execution is not good enough (considering also the size of stupid things, which happens near the end of this movie, in which I'll speak closer to the end of the text). Miller just put it in the film, to save face, if Miller had the courage and the quality, he would have developed it from the beginning of the film itself, to culminate in a quality ending, but Miller had other interests, such interests to win awards and recognition , instead of doing something of quality. With this, Miller may have won some awards from the academy, after all when the car chase scenes begin and that awful song begins, you begin to visualize the wind heads in the academy awards jumping off the couch and starting dancing and jumping like crazy , and they begin to rave how the world is evil and the fault lies with men (the academy has ceased to be relevant since the late 1950s when it began to take political positions).Stupid, I know. If you do not belong to the rebel age group (16 years-26 years old) and you're not delighted with bad and second- rate music, then Road Fury is just a mediocre action movie with 3 scenes of car chases. Passable and forgettable. Not to mention Miller had the sad idea of leaving the third act of the film, with the characters coming back the same way they did in the first and second acts. Amateur.I do not forget the lousy acting of the film, with the exception of Charlize Theron, no one knows how to act. Especially the women of Immortan Joe who have most quickly stepped off the walkways of a Victoria's Secret event (e.g. Rosie Huntington-Whiteley) and from acting, these ladies do not know anything, for sure. Or the 60-70 (with a body with only 130lb) years-old ladies coming back with Max and Furious in the third act, who begin to beat men in their 30s and 40s with 310lb of muscle easily. Or jumping from truck to truck, or from vehicle to vehicle like rabbits, defying the laws of physics. Even as an action movie this movie is pathetic.Stupid movie, no doubt.",1,7,10,19 November 2017
Furious 7," Movie for a select (but growing) group of people
","I never understood why this franchise always made so much money and why so many people like it. Unless you like to see half naked women sponging on wet cars, cars with modified engines used in street races (and of course it's all done in a team of outlaw guys, the so-called 'family', against other teams with people with similar desires) and to escape the police (police haters, they should inflate the scores here in IMDb), and to illicit traffic drugs and money, this type of film is not for you.I have a theory of mine because this series remains strong in the box office and each film gets better box office than the previous film of this franchise. The secret lies in the breakdown of our society. When this franchise began in 2001, our society was morally not decadent as it is today, nor so violent. In the last 16 years our society has grown worse and the values ​​of the old days began to disappear and our society and the moviegoers in general began to identify more and more ,each time, with the 'characters' of this type of film. This is the only explanation, which I see, because every movie this franchise has billed every time the previous movie.Not anything, in this movie at the level of content or structure that is worth as a film, whether purely as fun / entertaining or for possible logical/ make you think. Not a single quality exists in this film (or in this franchise, but actually beyond the seventh film, I only saw the second film in this series (which I consider absolute crap).Anything. Plot is not interesting, shallow characters like a plate, unless you like what they do. Characters with generic lines and say cool one liner to impress the younger ones. Bureaucratic action scenes - two guys jump with a sport car at high speed between two skyscrapers. The damage is minimal, almost non-existent. Ridiculous ending. Chiché story and action scenes without suspense, tension or in a interesting way visually. At least.A waste of time, at least for me.",1,13,22,1 January 2017
