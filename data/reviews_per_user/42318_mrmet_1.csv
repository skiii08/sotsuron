Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," This was a good movie, but it does not live up to the earlier films legacy
","While this movie had some of the greatest special effects I have ever seen, specifically the mind blowing ground battle scene and the now famous pod race, it lacks the depth of characters that the first three were built on. While the special effects in the first movies are obviously somewhat lacking by todays standards, the movies were extremely entertaining because they were character based.  Luke Skywalker, Han Solo and Princess Leia are household names, and when you watch those movies you care what happens to them and you understand them.  On the other hand, the characters in the Phantom Menace are horribly underdeveloped, with no background and horrible dialogue.  The acting is somewhat lacking, although I felt that this had more do do with the lack of good dialogue than poor performances.  Darth Maul, essentially this movies Darth Vader, says maybe three lines in the entire movie, and barely and background is given on him other than some cryptic tie he has to the emperor.  The light saber battles, a hallmark of the franchise, are much better choreographed with the larger budget and whatnot, but they lack any emotion what so ever.  Not a word is spoken during them, not even a grunt, scream or yell.  What really made the light saber battles in the first movies entertaining was the dialogue, showing Lukes true hatred for his opponent, and the paradox that with every swing he turns to the dark side.  In this movie, the saber battles seem forced, with no reason other than the opponent is the bad guy.  However, while it seems as though I am tearing into this movie, I did actually somewhat enjoy it. The special effects are great, and the story is convoluted, but decent. The space battle and the ground battle are both superb, as is the pod race. If I wasn't expecting something of Star Wars calibre I would have enjoyed it, but more like a god action movie than a true space adventure/drama.",6,0,1,23 May 1999
