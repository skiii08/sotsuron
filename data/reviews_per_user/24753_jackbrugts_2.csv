Changeling," Get me a changeling to watch this....
","I went seeing this movie with a rather biased mind. After all an Oscar screaming picture with Angelina Jolie and Clint Eastwood as a producer really must be something. And i was right, it is something....very bad. I can imagine that some people like it, but they probably are stomped flat by all typical American Hollywood screamers. The bland and totally out of place looking Jolly does a terrible job, and the extreme clichéd scenes are piece by piece cut like todays society and covered with a 50's sauce. A bad tasting one that is. The plot is just terrible and shamelessly clichéd in the extreme. I don't see why the makers went through with this and never noticed.Don't go see this movie,it's a complete waste of time and will probably lower your IQ.",1,9,35,4 March 2009
Ratatouille," Technical perfection completely out of place.
","Let me get right to the point, i think this is one of the worst animation movies i've ever seen. Why do American movie makers think that things in Europe work like they do in the US. The theme is French, the people are too, it plays in a restaurant in Paris. Yet it has not even the remotest European charm due to typical American moralism and blandness. So i wasn't even surprised that everybody is speaking with an Italian accent, behave like they in a sort of mafia movie an orders get screamed around like in some kind of cheap American diner. This movie is technical perfection, but does not go any further then the outside of nice graphics. It does strike me that the voice acting of the linguini caracterer is completely out of place and not suitable. A comparison to flushed away needs to be made, cause of the European rat theme, but there's really no need, flushed away is funny, very smart, intellectual and for all ages, where ratatouille is probably only for children, and boring, stupid and way over the top for adults. O yeah the story........there isn't any, apart from a vague cliché. The botomline is that i left after watching this rubbish after 45 minutes.",2,17,42,21 October 2007
