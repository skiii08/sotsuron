The Avengers," Best Superhero team up movie to date
","And that is all mostly due to all the previous ground work laid out by Marvel Studios. Pay attention, Warner Bros!!. This is how it's done!! . In order for this to work, some character development has to be put into place in the form of stand-alone movies giving the chance to each and every one of the team's member characters to shine and for us, the audience, to get to know them. Whether all these stand-alone movies have been up to snuff or not, is irrelevant. What it is relevant, is that the audience has had a chance to know them and therefore, care about what happens to them. And in that, this movie excells. Not only are all the characters given a chance to shine, but it also shows what a talented group of crew members and director can achieve when all the stars align. Very well written story, strong performances, an epic score by Alan Silvestri, state-of-the-art special and visual effects and a very fast, but not one bit rushed, pace, make this the best Avengers movie to date. Great entertainment.",10,2,2,26 April 2019
Blade Runner 2049," When the sequel bests the original
","As incredible as this may be, this is one of the few cases in which a sequel proves to be more engaging and effective than its predecessor. Being Blade Runner such a wonderfully brilliant visual spectacle as it is, it never, regrettably, reached those same heights for me in the story department. Ridley Scott, as I said in my review of that film, concerned himself more with the visuals than with achieving an engaging human story. This is not the case here with Villeneuve's picture. This time around we actually get to know more about the replicants, what they feel and their ultimate purpose in this world. The sequence in which K visits the Memories creator is especially revealing in that respect.
But let's get into the meat of it. The events take place 30 years after those in Blade Runner and, after the bankruptcy of Tyrrell Corporation and the banning of the remaining Replicants on Earth, the world is on the verge of economic and ecological collapse. That's when Niander Wallace enters the picture, taking over Tyrells' empire and avoiding famine thanks to his advances in synthetic farming. He also revamps Tyrell's Replicant programm, introducing models that are completely complacent and obedient to their creators. And here is when Ryan Gosling's character K comes in. He's a Replicant Blade Runner, who hunts down the remains of Tyrrell's old and scattered progeny, and, in the course of one of his investigations, he stumbles upon a secret that could shake the very foundations of the society he is a part of.
And that's when things get really interesting. There's so much more meat to this story than to that of the original Blade Runner, thanks in part to a very nuanced and engaging performance by Gosling. He really shines here and his, at first glance, cold and unattached approach to the character, turns out to be a protective shell that the character has built around him to protect him from a human environment that, as seen in several scenes of the movie, is clearly hostile towards him. His relationship with is Virtual Reality girlfriend Joi is especially endearing, and gives the character a much needed human touch, made all the more heartbreaking after she is destroyed. As per usual with the Hollywood mainstream, the production values of this movie are off the charts; production and costume design, beautiful photography by Award Winning Roger Deakins, a resounding marvel of a soundtrack by Zimmer and Wallfisch, closely matching the work of Vangelis for the first movie and, all in all, a very engaging story with the visuals to match. The story does have the advantage of a few twist and turns in which the character of Deckard, (a more confident performance by Harrison Ford than in the first movie), has a mayor role to play and the introduction of another main character, Wallace's right hand Replicant, Luv, that ends up being a tragic addition to the story. Well acted throughout and an astounding cinematic achievement in all regards.",10,0,15,24 April 2019
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Not quite there, but not a bad Star Wars entry
","I remember back in the day, when it came out, this was the one movie that everyone wanted to see and generally speaking, even though it felt a bit off, people were quite satisfied with it. It was later on, that people really started getting upset and likened it to one of the worst movies ever produced.
I must say, on my part, that although over time, and after repeated viewing the movie, didn't fulfill my expectations entirely, I've never been able to write it off as the massive failure that everyone seems to think it is. It's not quite at the same level as the Original trilogy, but from a technical standpoint was quite groundbreaking at the time and I remember been thoroughly enthralled by the whole experience, down mainly to this being the first ever Star Wars movie that I saw on the big screen. For that and mostly a nostalgic factor, I'm prone to forgive most of its shortcomings. Granted, it's got silly dialogue, most of the characters are one-dimensional or outright silly ( the Gungans come to mine), but it's got some truly amazing action set pieces (the pod race sequence, the final battle, the lightsabre duel between Obi-Wan and Qui-Gon versus Darth Maul.. to name just a few and a, once again, amazing soundtrack by master John Williams. Faulty, but not a complete write off. Watch it with an open mind.",7,1,1,21 May 2019
Captain Marvel," Half-cooked MCU entry
","For a MCU movie on which many people were placing such high hopes on, I cannot help but to be disappointed. It comes out, in my opinion, as half-cooked, as though the movie wasn't given enough time on the developing table to be fully realized. It's got some nice ideas floating around and the participation of a de-aged Samuel L. Jackson as a young Nick Fury, is always a joy to watch. The same cannot be said about a waxy-faced looking Clark Gregg as rookie Agent Caulson. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't.
The film seems to exist merely as an excuse to be a two-hour Easter egg of all past and upcoming MCU movies and although the movie, as all MCU movies, is mostly very competent on a technical level, it lacks pace, takes a long time to get going and only really starts to pick up on the last 15 min o so.
But, above all, my real gripe with the movie is the performance of Brie Larson as the main character, in one of the most uninspired performances of an actress in the MCU; made all the more disappointing as this being the first female-driven movie of the franchise, the whole thing was relying heavily on a good performance and coming from such a well regarded actress, it's very disappointing. All in all, an unsatisfaying movie that seems to have been made to justify Avengers :Infinity War's last post-credit sequence and a made-for-fans trip down memory lane.",5,2,3,11 March 2019
Aquaman," Exciting and visually stunning rollercoaster
","Many things have been said about this movie. That it's generic, formulaic, predictable, but most critics neglect to mention what an entertaining and visually stunning spectacle this is. Granted it's got some cliche dialogue and some of the humor falls flat. Jason Momoa is a cool guy and very charismatic and despite his obvious departure from the comic book look, short blond hair and blue eyes, he's got the physical attributes to sell the part. Amber Heard is also a very interesting addition and she's got some of the coolest underwater superpowers from any of the characters in the movie and along with Michael Shannon's General Zod, we get one of the strongest villains in the new DCEU, Patrick Wilson's King Orm. Strong cast, very good CGI, but what really takes the cake here is the production and costume design. The level of detail and the obvious amount of work that was put into recreating every last detail of the underwater kingdoms, specially Atlantis, is breathtaking. 3D viewing of this movie is mandatory. If ever there was a movie for which this format was created, this is it. In short, a very entertaining and amazing looking film.",8,1,4,27 December 2018
Thor: Ragnarok," MCU wild ride
","Not only is this probably one the best MCU entries to date, but it's a wacky and colorful spectacle, the likes of which, we haven't seen since the days of Flash Gordon. It doesn't reach the levels of campyness that Flash Gordon achieved, but it sure retains its wackiness and eye-candy elements. Production and costume design on this one are the main focus and a casting array that seem to be having the time of their lives (Jeff Goldblum and Cate Blanchett seem to be having a blast). Many hard-core fans may be upset by the many twist and turns that the movie takes and the humorous take on many of the elements and characters of the movie (Chris Hemsworth's capacity for making fun of himself is something that's been a constant of late in almost all of his movies and a very well received one), but it's something this movie excels on and what makes it, along with the Guardians of the Galaxy entries, one of the best exponents of the Marvel Cosmic Universe, which is slightly different to the Marvel Cinematographic Universe. Go watch it with no preconceived ideas of what a Superhero movie should look like and you'll thoroughly enjoy it. Great fun.",9,2,7,22 March 2019
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," Very solid ending to the trilogy
","Although this last chapter in the Star Wars original trilogy doesn't have the mastery of the Empire Strikes Back or the novelty of Star Wars; it was clearly, at the time, in many respects, the pinnacle of its technological achievements. Everything from production design to visual and practical effects is, once again, taken up a notch and vastly improved upon. The battle of Endor is a brilliant example of how far the technology had come at the time and after all these years, hasn't aged one bit. The movie begins quite well, with Han Solo's rescue by Luke and Co from the clutches of Intergalactic crime boss Jabba the Hutt, it follows quite nicely with Luke's discovery through Obi-Wan of yet more secrets about his origin and the subsequent laying out of the latest plan by the Rebel Alliance to destroy the Empire's newest Death Star. Unfortunately, once the protagonists land on Endor and we have the first few skirmishes with the Empire's troops, they run into the Ewoks. That's when the movie, for me, takes a bit of a nose dive. It thankfully picks up towards the end with the Final Battle and Luke and Vader's ultimate confrontation. That's my only gripe with the movie. Other than that, it is a very entertaining ride and a more than fitting end to a wonderful saga. Great fun.",9,0,0,21 May 2019
Bohemian Rhapsody," It will rock you.
","In spite of all the bad reviews this movie has received over the few months since its release, it's managed to attract a following that, if I'm not mistaken and I don't think I am, it's made it a box office hit and the highest grossing musical biopic ever made.
And I can perfectly understand why. It sure uses some well trodden paths and formulas to tell its story, but it also conveys something that most films nowadays lack. It conveys emotion. Whether you're a Queen fan or not, you cannot help but be moved by the story and especially the lead singer of one the best bands of the 20th century. Whatever the movie's faults may be, historical accuracy for the most part, it more than makes up for with heart and above all, a mesmerizingly uncanny portrayal of Freddie Mercury by Rami Malek. The rest of the cast help give his performance the necessary backbone that the story otherwise would lack. What's worth taking away from it, it's that it gives voice to a rock band that most young people nowadays wouldn't necessarily know existed. The movie goes in a crescendo until it finally reaches its end; Queen's Live Aid performance at Wembley Stadium. And if you're still not convinced to this point, that set piece alone is well worth the price of admission. That alone, and Malek's performance, did it for me. Do not miss out.",9,1,1,23 January 2019
Justice League," Promising premise with a messy resolution
","Too many cooks in the kitchen. That's what happened here. When tragedy struck Zack Snyder's life, the producers of Warner Bros took it as an opportunity to change things around and deliver a product that would massively deviate from the tone and style used by Snyder in his previous entries in the DCEU and be a more fan-pleasing and aimed for mass consumption product. The problem is that by trying to blend together such contrasting filming styles, the final cut resulted in one of the most bizarre viewing experiences seen in a long time.
The first act of the movie, with the introduction of the main characters and the main threat, choppily edited though it may be, is competent enough. It's during the second and third acts, that the movie's problems become more glaring. Unfinished and rushed CGI, glaring photographic tones and poorly developed characters and story arcs, are the norm here. That being said, it turned out to be a more enjoyable experience than that of BvS (at least Superman behaves the way he's supposed to). It's just to bad that because of some Warner exec's decisions, the movie turned out to be such a shooting and editing mess, that'll probably cost the planned sequels to be shelved for a very long time.",5,1,13,11 March 2019
Man of Steel," Hard edge Superman
","From a technical standpoint, this movie cannot be faulted in any way. It's where it takes its main character and what it does with it, that I have a problem with. Everything from costume design (although I have my reservations concerning the design and colour palette of Superman's new suit, being Christopher Reeve's suit my preferred version), production design ( Krypton's new and more organic look has grown on me overtime) and even Hans Zimmer's over-the-top score is top notch. And none of that would be an issue if it were not for the way, the screenwriters and especially the director, chose how Superman should behave. Call me old fashion, but the way I remember my Superman lore from the comic books and previous adaptations to the big screen, is not as an all powerful alien force who causes death and destruction wherever he goes. And there is plenty of that here, especially during Metropolis' fight scene of Supes against General Zod ( an otherwise very authoratitive and threatening Michael Shannon, easily one of the best things from the movie) at the end of the third act of the movie. Wanton destruction whenever there's a confrontation is a constant throughout and something, I think, should have been better handled. That out of the way, the way in which it is shown to us how powerful the character can be (the oil rig rescue sequence, the face-off against the World Engine...)is a positive to be taken from the movie as well as Clark's wandering around the world at the beginning of the movie in search of answers about his origins. The Tornado sequence in which Jonathan urges his son not to save him in front of everybody, thus revealing himself to the world, I think too, should have been handled better. Another sign of the screenwriters not knowing what to do with the character. Amy Adams proves to be miscast as Lois Lane and the chemistry between her and Cavill is non existent. Cavill proves doubters that under proper direction he could be a great Superman and Lawrence Fishburne's Perry White is another bit of shrewd casting. I think that, all in all, all the elements for making a good Superman movie are there. It's just that they're not handled very well, it's all.",6,0,1,11 March 2019
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," One of the best Sci-fi sequels ever made
","And I don't say that lightly. It's up there with Empire Strikes Back and Blade Runner 2049. It's that good.
Which it isn't that surprising considering who's behind it.
When The Terminator first came to light in 1984 and became such a massive sleeper hit, it was inevitable that a sequel would eventually get made. And who better to do it than the man who came up with the idea and directed the first one. But being James Cameron who he is, in always wanting to push the envelope when it comes to groundbreaking filmmaking, he delivered, what was at the time, the most expensive and one of the most technically challenging movies of the 90s. With a strong cast, script, state of art visual and practical effects and a wonderful score by Brad Fiedel to match, we're given the ultimate masterclass in how to make a Sci-fi movie and, in the case of this franchise, something that would never be repeated again. In my humble opinion, this is how the Terminator movies should have ended. All the rest is just commercial fodder.",10,1,4,26 April 2019
Batman Begins," Very solid origin story for Batman
","Right of the bat, there's a very keen interest on the screenwriters and director's part to delve into Batman's backstory and get to know the man behind the mask. Such in-depth study had never before been done for the titular character in any of its previous iterations for the big screen. More attention had been given to the production design, special and visual effects and main villains, while Batman himself was often relegated to be a secondary character in his own movie, playing second fiddle to everything else that was around him.
This time around, and under the firm guidance of Nolan and his creative team, we get to explore the psyche and humanity behind the hero; all of this, of course, with the great help of a truly inspired Christian Bale. He is, to me at least, what Chris Reeve was for Superman; the perfect incarnation of the comic book character.
Supported by a great cast, chief among whom, Gary Oldman as future Commisioner Gordon, Michael Caine as Alfred and Liam Neeson as the main villain Rha's Al Ghul, deserve especial mention, Bale delivers one of the best performances of his career. But none of that could have been achieved without the vision of Christopher Nolan. Following in the footsteps of Richard Dooner's Superman The Movie and with the help of a creative team, David S. Goyer chief among them, who really understand and respect the source material, he delivers one of the best translations of a comic book character to the big screen ever seen.
Production values aside, which of course are top notch, this movie owes much of its success to a very well written and solid script. This is the main foundation around which everything else is so well structured.
There is one drawback to this movie,though, and the main reason why it doesn't get top marks from me. And that would be the action set pieces. As well planned and choreographed as they surely were, their execution onscreen is not on par with it and in this instance, blame must surely be laid on the feet of a director that, before this movie, wasn't especially recognized for the way he handled heavy action sequences. They are correct, for the most part, but lack the energy of someone used to dealing with this kind of subject matter. Hans Zimmer's score has some very nice bits to it, but never reaches the heights that John Williams did for his Superman score. Nitpicking aside, a very solid and very well put together Superhero movie.",9,0,0,27 March 2019
The Favourite," Study about the human condition wrapped in a gorgeous looking period piece
","It seems, by all accounts, at least in a cinematic way, that this new year is getting off to a brilliant start. This movie is a jewel, and not only in the visual sense, but also screenplay wise. A study of how fickle, unpredictable and mean, human nature can be, hasn't been put to the screen with such attention to grousome detail in quiet some time. Helped by a magnificent script, spot on cast and gorgeous cinematography, this is one the best movies I've seen this year and according to sources, it promises to get better and better. Lanthimos uses witty, ironic and often abusive language to portray a series of characters and an era, that was well known for cultivating an appetite for the excessive. Not one character in this movie escapes unscathed and the visual style and cinematography, remind me very much of another masterpiece, Kubrick's Barry Lyndon. See it with an open mind. It'll blow you away. Mesmerizing.",10,7,16,23 January 2019
Back to the Future Part III," Fitting ending to the franchise
","So, we've finally come to the end of the road. And what a sweet journey it has been. Being the last one in the trilogy, this one is below par when compared to the other two and clearly suffering from script exhaustion. There's only so much you can get out of a story and in spite of all of its shortgivings, it still boasts one of the best crews and casts ever assembled for a motion picture. The script still has its moments, despite being a retread of the first two in most instances and there's a feeling of familiarity and repetitiveness to the whole thing. That being said, giving Doc Brown a romantic arc to his character and pairing him up with Mary Steenburgen, was a wise script choice, indeed and Thomas F. Wilson's turn as Beauford Tannen is his best yet, and he's been a constant brilliant during the whole franchise. Marty finally resolves his character's issues and gets to have his happy ending. But what really takes the cake here, is Rick Carter's efforts to recreate Hill Valley's Wild West origins and an amazing soundtrack by Alan Silvestri, up there with the best of Western themed scores and easily his best of the series. Continuity on this one is still a standard on how to make a sequel and what has made this trilogy among so many which have failed, stand the test of time. It leaves you with a bittersweet feeling but, as they say, all good things must come to an end.",7,0,0,8 March 2019
The Dark Knight," Proof that a sequel can be as good, if not sometimes better than its predecessor
","Believe or not, at least in this case, Christopher Nolan seems to have outdone himself, delivering a truly remarkable sequel. Counting on pretty much the same creative team with whom he made Batman Begins and with a cast that was more than up to the challenge, he delivers a powerful story that, not only equals, but sometimes even outmatches its predecessor in all of its technical and artistic aspects. Special mention must be given to the late Heath Ledger, who delivers one of the most disturbing turns of a comic book villain ever seen on the big screen. His mere presence permeates the whole of the movie and the unpredictable nature of his character makes for some really surprising story's twists and turns. That's the nature of the whole movie. The audience is constantly kept on their toes and there is no safe ground on which to rest. This incarnation of The Joker, more than any other, really gives Batman a run for his movie. A solid script, with very well written characters and a definite improvement in the way the action set pieces are handled, makes this,one of the best Superhero sequels ever made and a water mark for future ones. Not much else can be said about this marvel. Good performances throughout and remarkable production values, this one takes the action up a notch with the inclusion of a bunch of sequences shot with IMAX cameras. If given the chance, watch it this way. I did, and it was a terrific experience.",10,0,0,27 March 2019
Total Recall," Awesome sci-fi treat
","Based on a short story by science fiction author Philip K Dick, this is, without a doubt, the funniest and more action packed film to come out of one of his story adaptations. And they got the right man for the job. Dutch director Paul Verhoeven, fresh off his success with Robocop, another Sci-fi great, we get one of the more rounded movies of the early 90s. Not only it proyected Schwarzenegger's already profitable career in the movie business to the stratosphere, it also helped to cement Verhoeven's place in the American industry. This film also marked a transition period between practical effects and the onset of the visual effects era. And for a movie its age, it looks nigh perfect. There was an artistry to special effects with the use of matte paintings, optical effects and with its make up effects, that you'd be hard pushed to find in today's sci-fi movies. Granted that it being, in many respects, a Schwarzenegger action vehicle, it found in Verhoeven the perfect director to transcend that barrier and make something else out of it. Ronny Cox and Michael Ironside play the perfect villains while Schwarzenegger does an interesting turn as both an intergalactic spy and apparently a wholesome factory worker. Or is it the other way round?. The thing is, that being the plot of the movie as twisting and turning as it is, we never know for sure if the main character is living these events or they are played out as part of a fantasy-implanted journey to Mars and all of it might just be a dream. That's what's great about this movie, the ending is open to interpretation and we are left to wonder. Solid script, great action set pieces, even greater special and makeup effects and a terrific cast to boot. Pure 90s deliciousness.",10,5,5,31 January 2019
Titanic," Timeless and epic masterpiece
","On a purely technical level, Titanic was considered at the time the crowning achievement of a filmmaker who's always strived to top his last cinematographic entry with the next. Up until that point and still to this day, he's managed to do just that. He's always made the most of the technological advantages at the time and always come up with a jaw-dropping, mesmerizing visual spectacle. Even at times when budget constraints and uncooperative technical crew, due in part for his apparent lack of experience and fresh off- the- boat from his first serious outing on the directorial chair for The Terminator, like it was the case in Aliens, he's always managed to deliver. It sure does take him a long time to come up with the next one, but everytime he does, he hits the box office's bullseye.
This time around and, with one of the more simplistic storylines ever put to the big screen, he brings us one of the most memorable and fondly remembered movies of the late 90s.
From the very first shot of the movie, those sepia color-corrected images that convey a haunting feeling of remembrance and loss, to the first images of the research vessel subs exploring the entrails of the haunted ship, we plunge right into what it must have felt like walking onto the deck of the Titanic. And we go back to the plot. As I said before, using the simplest of plot devices, a , on the other hand, very well told love story with tinges of social clashing, we are treated to a 3 hour, eye - catching spectacle that moves along at a whip-like pace. With very strong performances all throughout, gorgeous cinematography and production design, state-of-the-art visual and practical effects and a perfect score by the great late James Horner, this is probably one of Cameron's best efforts behind the camera and a movie for the ages. Needless to say, the strongest asset of the movie is its third and final act, with the depiction of the sinking of the titular ship and the resulting mayhem. That, as always, and with the character development groundwork previously laid out by Cameron, is the main reason to watch this movie, and why the audience is so invested in what's happening onscreen. As I said, great movie and larger-than-life characters to go with it.",10,6,8,22 March 2019
Back to the Future Part II," Solid follow-up to the original
","So we're back in time once again. And this time the journey turns out to be a crazy rollercoaster ride. It sure doesn't have the novelty or freshness of the original and certain aspects of the movie, like the casting of Michael J Fox to play all of his children, messy aging make-up on all the actors, shameless product placement, don't help its case. But, on the other hand, save a few unfortunate casting choices due to the unavailability of some (Claudia Wells couldn't return due to family issues), and utter refusal of others (Crispin Glover refused to come back on the grounds of not getting paid enough), the movie manages to maintain a nice sense of continuity, despite having being shot four years after the original, and a solid script by Bob Gale and Robert Zemeckis, once again provides the solid foundation needed for getting the most out of its story and actors. Beautifully shot and photographed once again by Dean Cundey and with an amazing score by a returning Alan Silvestri, the movie is a joy to watch from beginning to end. It's a thrilling ride that will keep you on the edge of your seat the whole time and it's got one of the best twists ever seen on a movie. The choice of having to go back to 1955 on the exact same date the facts of the first movie take place in order to fix the Future, is a brilliant one, and gives the crew and cast a chance to revisit the first movie from a different point of view. It's easily the highlight of the movie and its final outcome provides it with one more twist for the upcoming sequel. Despite critics and hardcore fans of the original, this is one of the best sequels ever made and a solid turn from Gale, Zemeckis and all those involved to give us a follow-up that was never in their minds to begin with. Bucket loads of fun.",8,0,0,8 March 2019
The Dark Knight Rises," Weaker closing chapter to the trilogy
","In spite of all its many problems, and it does have them in abundance, this is still are very solid and well put together movie from a technical standpoint. Regrettably, screenplay wise, it's not as well written and the secondary characters and especially the villains, are not as interesting and well written as in the first two movies. Tom Hardy's Bane is meant to be menacing and to a certain extent, he is. He clearly put a lot of effort and gym hours into creating an imposing physical presence, but his choice of going with a weird sounding voice for his character, mostly undermines his character's onscreen presence. As for Marion Cotillard's Talia Al Ghul, she comes off as underdeveloped, doesn't have enough of an onscreen presence, which is a shame, being as she is quite a charismatic and competent actress (her previous role in Christopher Nolan's Inception proves that). That aside, a positive addition to the cast is Anne Hatthaway's Selina Kyle. She does a solid turn as Catwoman, although she is never mentioned by her nickname throughout the movie, and manages to flesh out her character showing her as being both vulnerable and a tough cookie. The work of the rest of the cast is, for the most part, correct, with a few standouts in the case of Gary Oldman, who is his usual solid-self, and especially Michael Caine's Alfred. They're both given the best dialogue in the movie and make memorable use of it. Christian Bale is consistent throughout and nicely conveys a man who's been broken down, both physically and psychologically, by years of crime fighting and zero recognition for it, even if he sometimes goes overboard with his Batman's voice.
Now for the good stuff. Action set pieces, like Batman's first outing after years in hiding, his brutal fight with Bane, defeat, and consequent imprisonment in The Pit and his final escape from it, with the added enhancement of the use of IMAX cameras, are surely the standouts here. Nolan makes ,once again, great use of Hans Zimmer's score and the ending, though far fetched, is quite emotional.
The addition of Robin's character as a surprise twist at the very end, teasing a future come back of the character in the future and Bruce's relationship with Talia, come off as forced and added only for the purpose of plot convenience. All in all, a solid, although somewhat disappointing end to the saga.",8,0,0,29 March 2019
Creed II," The Rocky saga is alive and well
","It should be no surprise, that having Sylvester Stallone still with producer and writing credits behind this movie, and also in front of the camera, that this turned out to be such a solid movie. This movie is developing a new character in the series, the strong - headed, but good-hearted, Adonis Creed, son of the late Apollo Creed. It follows the Rocky movies template to the letter, in that it tries to balance the protagonist's personal life with his success in the ring. But there is a twist. The side story involving Ivan Drago and his son turns out to be as, if not, even more important than that of Adonis and Rocky. They're not portrayed simply as the evil opponents any more. There's more to their father and son relationship than meets the eye. This, for me, is the highlight of the movie. Acting is strong throughout, there are many touching scenes throughout between Adonis and his wife( the discovery of their child having been born deaf, Adonis's marriage proposal), Rocky reuniting with his estranged son and a grandchild he's never met before and his relationship with Adonis, whom he considers, by all accounts, as his own son. You get the inevitable fall from grace of the main protagonist, which was to be expected, and the subsequent build up and later resurgence with training montage included. Cliche some times, but highly enjoyable and entertaining.",8,0,1,31 January 2019
Blade Runner," Sci-fi benchmark
","Enough cannot be said about the virtues of this movie, both visually and thematically. It's one of Ridley Scott's finest efforts behind the camera and a sci-fi benchmark that created a legacy that still permeates everything that it's related to futuristic and technogical landscapes.
From the very first shot, the movie will grab you by the scruff of the neck and take you on a visually stunning journey where there is even room for philosophical ruminations about the very nature of what it means to be human. But not all of it is fantasy and wonder. The movie is flawed in that it depicts its main characters in a very unrelatable and detached manner. This is also its worst pitfall. Scott was way more concerned about creating a futuristic setting than he was in delving into his characters' psyches. Actors were left to their own devices when trying to gleam into their characters reasons for being. Most of what can be seen on the screen, acting wise, was due to the actors commitment to their respective roles, e.g; Rutger Hauer's compelling performance of an android who only wants for his kind and his own, that which mankind has always taken for granted, the possibility of living longer and free, must surely be the outstanding performance of the movie.
Nitpicks aside, the movie is still to this day a remarkable cinematographic achievement and one that gains with repeated viewing. Amazing production design, photography and state of the art special effects has made it stand the test of time. Along with viewing it in its final cut version, which is the best of its five cuts, a viewing of the documentary; '' Dangerous Days'' in which we, the audience, are given the chance to dive right into the laborious and painstaking process of creating such a cinematic marvel, is not only advisable, but mandatory.

Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," Space Opera that signalled the beginning of an Era
","So many things have been said about this movie over the years, that's difficult to even know where to begin. The brainchild of a certain George Lucas and a clear homage to the Space Adventure serials of the 40s, this movie captured the essence of what it is that we want to see every time we go to the movies. It's a dazzling visual spectacle, sprinkled with a little bit of mythology, and populated with an array of well written and engaging characters. Everything from production design, visual and practical effects, to an immensely popular score by John Williams, that along with his forays with Spielberg (Jaws, Indiana Jones, E.T..) is recognized the world over. It was also the introduction of one of the most popular villains in cinematic history, Darth Vader. His threatening and imposing physical presence coupled with the voice of James Earl Jones, made him the ultimate Star Wars villain that, even to this day, hasn't been matched in the Star Wars lore. That aside, it's an incredibly simplistic story but very well told ( although a big part of the merit goes out to Marcia Lucas, who apparently saved the movie on the editing table). This movie created a fan base and cult following, nowadays only matched by that of the MCU fan base, and helped define the term Blockbuster. So many scenes of this movie have been etched into the minds of the fans; those iconic shots of the Skywalker homestead on the desolate planet Tatooine, the introduction of Han Solo in an Intergalactic bar, which is clearly a homage to the Western genre, the first time we get to see Darth Vader, the looming presence of the Death Star, the iconic last battle... I could go on and on about the cultural and cinematic importance of this movie. Needless to say, if you can get a hold of a copy of the unaltered version of this movie, before the infamous changes made by Lucas for the 1997 re-release , that's surely the best way to enjoy it. As it was originally intended. Great movie and something that should be in everybody's watch list.",9,0,0,21 May 2019
Green Book," Thought provoking tale with lots of heart behind it
","I already said in one of my previous reviews that this was fixing up to be a great year for cinema lovers. And so far, it has lived up to expectations. Not only has the output of movies been great, but it also seems that the Academy heads this year have made a sensible selection; this movie having been included in the category for best film of the year. Academy accolades aside, this a truly remarkable film, especially coming from a director, Peter Farelly, who, so far, has specialised in the comedy genre.
This is a huge departure from his previous body of work and it shows that, given the right script and the right assemble of actors, he can be a huge game changer when it comes to telling heartwarming stories about flawed, but ultimately, good-hearted characters. Beautifully shot ( the production design is especially remarkable) , written and acted ( Viggo Mortensen surprises once again in one of his most nuanced performances to date and Marhershala Ali delivers another strong performance, in what it's turning out to be an outstanding acting career), this is truly one of the best movies l've seen this year, and unlike so many others Oscar winning movies, one that is destined to live long in the memory of its audience. This is not your 'run of the mill' Oscar bait movie. This is a solid, very well put together movie that will make you think. And that's what movie going is all about.",9,2,3,7 February 2019
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," Amazing follow up and a master class in how to make a sequel
","Although, if we're being fair, this is definitely the movie that made me fall in love with the saga. True, I'd already seen the original Star Wars and even though I'd quite liked that movie, it wasn't until I'd seen this one that I really fell for the saga. And all of this, mainly because, in almost every level, this movie is clearly superior to the original. The tone is darker, the characters' story arcs are better developed ( the love triangle only hinted at in the first movie is finally resolved, Luke's path as a Jedi and his ultimate and painful discovery of his origins), and the multiple twists and turns of the plot takes the story to very interesting places. It's this journey of love and self-discovery, coupled with the amazing use of its visual elements ( production values on this one were clearly taken up a notch) that makes this, not only the ultimate Star Wars movie, but also the ultimate sequel. John William's score is ,once again, astounding. Due to, not in small measure, a very well written script by Lawrence Kasdan and Leigh Brackett, George Lucas's involvement only being in the general plotting of the storyline, the movie gains a level of mastery sadly never achieved with the following sequels. Of special significance are the Planet Hoth battle, the Millenium Falcon chase by the Imperial Fleet through an asteroid field and the ultimate confrontation between Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker on the Cloud City of Bespin, where it takes place one of the most shocking reveals in cinematographic history.
This is clearly an example of the sequel being quite superior to the original. I put it up there with The Godfather 2 and Terminator 2, to name just two of the most popular examples. Great movie and an absolute blast of enjoyment.",10,0,1,21 May 2019
Back to the Future," The perfect script
","One of the many reasons why this is my favourite movie of all times is because it's got one of the best scripts ever written for a movie. Everything that it's set up at the very beginning, pays off later.
For a movie that had such a rocky start from the production point of view and whose very creators didn't have much faith in, it sure made box office waves all around the world and made it one of the most fondly remembered and classical movies of the 80s. It catapulted Michael J Fox and Christopher Lloyd to stardom and turned one of the biggest automobile failures of the 80s into an iconic vehicle.
Everything seemed to fall into place for this one. Not only the screenplay, but the acting, directing, production design, visual effects, editing and cinematography. It's an extremely tightly edited movie, not a moment wasted, it moves along like lightning, and after all this years, its 80s look hasn't aged it one bit. This is one of the most entertaining cinematographic experiences ever and if you still haven't seen it; What are you waiting for?. Let's go back in time!!'",10,1,1,22 January 2019
