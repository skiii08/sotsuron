The Monuments Men," 'Art for art's sake' in this mild war film about a crack unit of artists.
","Around this St Valentine's Day is the usual slew of romance-based films, but also rather surprisingly, a bunch of war-films too. This film caught my interest, seeming to deliver a nice balance in entertainment, without making the subject-matter too heavy, and so it turned out.Film is by 20th Century Fox and Columbia. It stars George Clooney, who also directed and produced it, as well as wrote the screenplay. Thus this is very much George Clooney's baby. Last year he merely played second fiddle to Sandra Bullock in the critically acclaimed 'Gravity'. If that film showcased Miss Bullock, then this one does the same, in spades, for Mr Clooney. Like 'The Descendants' of two years previously, once again we have a film that captures a mix of emotions.This is a war film so it tends to follow a well trod format. Like, for example, 'The Dirty Dozen' (1967), it starts with a military objective being set out. Then the unit is recruited and trained, before finally going into action. However apart from this being set in WWII, just as was 'TDD', in most other aspects this film is very different.Firstly, it is important to state, as the film itself does, that this film is based on a true story. George Clooney plays the part of an artistic type, who knowing the threat to the art world posed by the war, is tasked to assemble a group of educated and like-minded individuals, to go and protect and rescue art-works threatened with destruction or theft.Film opens with the art-saving scenario and quickly moves on to the recruitment and basic-training of the unit. Before much time has elapsed the unit has been sent across the Channel to France where war is raging. Like 'TDD', this film too, has an all-star cast. Matt Damon rightly deserves his second billing with his very entertaining character. He is required to speak French, and I could not get enough of this. His French is subtitled, so that we can enjoy the full richness of his dialogue. So do mind the French.The French joie de vivre, is displayed perfectly by Cate Blanchett. The scenes between Miss Blanchett and Mr Damon, seem to capture perfectly the essence of the time. Mr Clooney seems to capture this well too in a Christmas scene. This one, like others in the film, captures the good and the bad. In war there is laughter as well as tears, joy and sadness. The fact of the very fragility of life, in war, is shown in the mix of emotions. Everything is intensified, from comradeship to mafioso horse.In style then, this film, if anything, is shot in the same style as 'The Great Escape' (1963). That film too was based on a true story. Like this one, it was populated with interesting characters, had funny scenes, and sad scenes. So yes, like 'TGE', 'TMM' is a sort of boys own adventure story, a romp, and a ripping good yarn. However it is still a war story, and several scenes have been inserted that reflect the worst of times that were WWII. So, be prepared to be entertained, but be prepared also for a lump in the throat, and the tears to well up too.Before WWII, Winston Churchill warned of the rise of the Nazis, and when the war had started, he was rightly the man needed to step into the breach. He viewed the struggle as one between Civilisation and a new Dark Age. As the Huns, Goths, and Vandals, destroyed The Roman Empire, so too the art-destroying, book-burning, Hunnish Nazis, even as they retreated, as they faced defeat, seemed determined to plunge Europe into a new Dark Age. This film shines a light on a story, that helped prevent the darkness descending, and helped us to emerge, (one scene in particular very explicitly shows this in a metaphorical way), emerge from the darkness, and into the light.For many years, 'The Great Escape', was traditional Christmas fayre (at least for the British anyway). Now Mr Clooney has made a modern film that can compete with that one. Like that one, this film is populated by ordinary people, trying to do extraordinary things. The film captures well the breadth of the war; unlike some Hollywood productions that show only the Americans winning the war, this film seems to make an effort to show accurately the Allied effort. So we encounter Limeys as well as Yanks on the Western Front. The French Resistance is also mentioned. The Eastern Front is not entirely neglected, so watch out for the Russkies too, they were players too, in this story too! As said, this film, in tone, is very much like 'The Great Escape'. So enjoy it, and cheer along, as our heroes battle against the evil Nazis. Film is a romp suitable for nearly all of the family except those whose more delicate dispositions are easily upset.Based on a true story, this is an entertaining, good, and uplifting, film. A war story with some comedic moments, and some sad ones too. 10/10.C'mon the artists!",Null,3,6,18 February 2014
Captain Phillips," True story of a USA ship-Captain's encounter with pirates.
","Columbia Picture. Tom Hanks is the eponymous 'Captain Phillips' of this film. He is a merchant seaman and the Captain of a USA cargo-ship attacked by Somali pirates. This modern-day true story is the basis for this tense, character-driven, action-thriller.Film opens with Captain Phillips preparing to leave home and go to work. Home scenes come across as mundane and realistic. However the journey to the airport jars with a conversation between husband and wife that seems unbelievable. Supposedly married for the best part of two decades, it seems as if they have never talked to each other before this day and have now woken up and discuss their family and the world in a very ponderous and wooden way. However as this is a true story we will just have to accept this bad and clunky scene. So do not be put off at this point as the film picks up after this scene.Meanwhile we are also seeing scenes from halfway across the world. In Somalia to be precise. Although Somalia has failed to function as a properly governed nation-state for two decades. Somalia is in fact in a state of anarchy and is dominated and ruled by war-lords. We see enough to feel the atmosphere and culture in these brief glimpses. We see too the young Somali men who are the pirates. We can understand their mentality and situation, and compare and contrast it with that of Captain Phillips.Supposedly Director Paul Greengrass asked Tom Hanks what he thought the film was about. TH said 'Pirates', PG replied 'Globalization' and asked TH again, who replied again 'Pirates'. This reviewer agrees totally with Mr Hanks.In an interview Tom Hanks described how he and his crew did not meet the pirate crew before the pirates attempted to hijack the ship. Clearly the Director wanted this for the shock factor for the Hanks crew and to capture that in an authentic way. A good idea which clearly worked. Sadly however, because of the earlier Somali scenes, we viewers did not get quite the same shock-factor. To us the pirates were not quite that same unknown quantity.The Director Paul Greengrass, who directed 'United 93' in 2006, seems to be trying to give the impression that he is looking at both sides in this film. However he is only pretending to be even-handed. A film entitled 'Captain Phillips' is not about the Somali pirates themselves but rather about Captain Phillips. The pirates are only important in so far as they impact on Captain Phillips. As such therefore it would have been much better if we, like the Captain and crew, did not see the pirates, until they had boarded the ship. However, having said that, a much more interesting film could have been made from the point of view of the pirates. In 'The Sopranos', David Chase was able to give us a Soprano POV, a pirate POV could have been similarly sublime.'CP' is a film of two halves. The first half, you get what you expect, if you have seen the trailers. The second half is a little different. It is in fact a little slow in parts. However the tension does build. The problem is that this is really just a small little story. If a film is wanted with a modern-day Somali pirate story-line, then other true stories would be much more interesting. The reality is that this is just an interesting story, for historical reasons, for audiences in the USA, because it is unusual. While the film is shot from various perspectives, it is mainly shot from the perspective of Americans, particularly of course, Captain Phillips.Tom Hanks is Captain Phillips. His acting is tremendous throughout. Having said that however, all acting is superb. Both the crews, the ship's crew, and the pirate crew, give convincing performances. Rather than an action film, perhaps it is better to consider the film as a character study. We have the battle of wits between the two captains. We have also the interplay between the different members of the pirate crew. If ever a film demonstrated the need for constitutional government and a properly structured command-and-control system, then this is the film.A major criticism of this film must be the camera work. Director Paul Greengrass, certainly in the early parts of the film, seems to want to give it a documentary feel. He does. Sadly however, much of this 'documentary-feel' is spoilt by cameras swinging violently, and sickeningly, quickly. In later parts we have incredibly close-up close-ups. Again, uncomfortably so. There are also hand-held cameras that veer about violently. A little, of some of this, may have been needed. Most was not. Except if the intention was to make the cinema audience feel slightly sea-sick. It certainly did not make viewing more enjoyable, but rather less so.This is not a great film, but it is a good film, the subject matter makes it so. 'Captain Phillips' tells the story of what happened to a ship's Captain. It is a film, and story, that gets tenser, and tenser, as it goes on. When the film ended my cinema audience seemed to have been shocked into a stunned silence, although I felt ever so slightly underwhelmed. If you want to find out what happened to Captain Phillips, then this is the film for you. If you are wanting to find out a lot about Somalia and it's pirates, try reading up about them instead.This modern-day pirate story, is a true story, and a good film. 8/10.",Null,0,1,5 November 2013
If I Stay," A lot of music and tears in this teenage romance tearjerker love story.
","A Warner Brothers/MGM film. 'If I Stay' is a tearjerker film about a teenage-girl who experiences an out-of-body experience whilst in a coma.The teenage-girl is played well by Chloe Grace Moretz. As film opens we discover that she is part of a sickly-sweet family that seems just too perfect. Off out together, they are involved in an accident. Miss Moretz's character, Mia Hall, comes to, but does not understand why she is being ignored by the emergency services, as she stumbles about in a dream-like state. Seeing herself, she starts to understand, as she goes to the hospital. These scenes all occur at the start of the film, the rest of the film is based at the hospital, with the majority of the film being flash-backs.Director RJ Cutler has done a good job here. The scenes at the accident are, as said, rather dream-like, thus capturing the confused state of Miss Hall. Miss Moretz captures well the disorientation of her character. Both Director Mr Cutler and actress Miss Moretz capture well the out-of-body experience. As a disembodied spirit, Mia Hall has no physical abilities thus travel can only be achieved via open doors etc.Thus, 'If I Stay' is completely different from 'Ghost' and 'Truly, Madly, Deeply', both of 1990. Those films were about the interaction of living breathing humans and the spirits of dead humans. Not so in this film. 'If I Stay' does however share one thing with both of those other films, a love story.Flashbacks tell us that the teenage schoolgirl Mia Hall, has fallen in love with older boy Adam, played by Jamie Buckley. The two were attracted to each other, and did fall in love, but were troubled with what might be described as musical differences. Thus this film has a major musical plot-line that reminds of the recently screened 'Begin Again'. The films are similar in many ways, the major one being that we viewers get to hear a fair bit of music. Mia and boyfriend Adam are both musicians, though very different ones. However the music does provide one further link to 'Truly, Madly, Deeply'.The two young lovers are ably supported by a great cast, all of whom are good, but special mention should go to those playing family members. Joshua Leonard plays Mia's father. He and the Director got the flashback scenes just right, they are also funny, as we see the younger wild rocker turn into the more sedate parent. Hair-styles in those scenes was particularly good. Mireille Enos, playing the mother, has some poignant scenes with her daughter. However the most emotional scenes were with veteran actor Stacy Keach. He gives a stand-out performance, particularly in one very emotional and very important scene.Preparing for her role in Kick Ass (2010), Miss Moretz trained with a stunt-crew for three months and also did most of her own stunts. For her musical role in 'If I Stay', Miss Moretz is also reported to have engaged in much musical study. Last year she gave a tremendous performance in the 2013 remake of 'Carrie'. Here, in 'If I Stay', we once again see Miss Moretz play a somewhat shy girl, that sometimes seems dreamily unaware, but that at other times capture perfectly the utmost depths of the rawest of emotions.Shauna Cross wrote the screenplay of the Gayle Forman novel. Director RJ Cutler has done a great job. Outside shots, particularly those featuring different seasons, were done well, ably capturing the sense of passing time.This teenage love-story shares a supernatural spiritual love story like 'Ghost' and 'Truly, Madly, Deeply'. Like 'TMD' it also has some hauntingly beautiful music. The film is also about music and could be described as a teenage version of 'Begin Again'. If you liked any of those films, then 'If I Stay' will appeal to you.This tearjerker deserves 10/10 but needs a hanky.",Null,58,88,2 September 2014
Gravity," A sublime Sandra Bullock is lost in space.
","A force, such as gravity, pulls the object into a curved path as it attempts to fly off in a straight line.Thus a small object in space will orbit a large one.This 91 minute, Warner Brothers film, rated 12A in the UK, tells the story of a small object, like a space-station, or to be more precise, a very small speck of an astronaut, played by Sandra Bullock, in orbit around the relatively very large Earth.Space is big, and in this vast Universe there are planets and stars, with a lot of space in between. This space is a void, a vast nothing.Film opens in space above Earth. At first we hear nothing and see nothing. Then a faint communication is heard which gradually gets louder. We see a small speck get gradually larger. It is a spacecraft and astronauts are working on it as it orbits high up above the Earth.Sandra Bullock plays one astronaut, George Clooney plays another. Mr Clooney's astronaut is an experienced veteran. Miss Bullock's astronaut, by contrast is a rookie. Both are engaged in a spacewalk. Mr Clooney is enjoying his time in space however mission-control are worried about Miss Bullock performing her allotted task without getting sick.Those viewers who experienced the shaky camera of the recent 'Captain Phillips', will be glad to know that this film is completely different from that. You, and I, and Sandra Bullock, may have no idea of what is up, and down, but only mission-control will worry about sickness in this film. Viewers while experiencing a realistic representation of weightlessness in space, in this film, will not find it filmed in such a way as to make them queasy.In the vastness of space around Earth, mission-control detects a collision between two other space-craft. This sets off some sort of localized intergalactic bar-billiards game. Broken bits of spacecraft are now heading towards our astronauts who are now in deadly danger. Film shows realistically the danger presented by these fast travelling objects. All are in orbit, and in the void of space, there is no gravity or atmosphere between the objects and anything they may hit. Collisions in space, in Star Trek, or similar films, have been done before, but this film shows the danger in a realistic way, that other films have failed to capture before.When the collisions occur, they are catastrophic. Astronaut Bullock loses her tether and floats off, spinning out of control, into space, alone, and with a finite amount of oxygen.It has been said that Miss Bullock spent a lot of time preparing for this role. She certainly conveys to us viewers the problems of weightlessness in space. As well as objects hurtling through the void of space, we also get a good representation of the problems of inertia. Propulsion gets you moving in relation to other objects, but how do you stop? There are lots of bone-crunching collisions, attempts to catch and get a hold of objects are all well portrayed. All of this while hurtling through the void of space, orbiting above Earth.George Clooney is perfect in the supporting role but Sandra Bullock is the real star of this film. The film is clearly a Bullock vehicle but this space vehicle had to be very good. It is. Actress Bullock has been given a tremendous space vehicle. Astronaut Bullock could only wish she had such a space vehicle.Great as this film is, Sandra Bullock has to carry it, for it to succeed, and carries it, she does, with a truly sublime performance. Miss Bullock has graced the silver-screen for many years now with great performances in rom-coms. Her everyday girlish charms have contributed to some of the greatest examples of the rom-com genre. There has never been any doubt that she can do light, but what about the meatier, more serious, stuff? Earlier this year, Miss Bullock appeared in the surprisingly gritty 'The Heat' female buddy-cop action-comedy. Here though she goes much further, this is her film, a true action film that is exciting, scary and tense. It is a tour-de-force.Film has some shocks, surprises and twists. It is also tense and emotional. You may find it useful to carry a hanky.This 91 minute film reminds us of the earlier Warner Brother films of yester-year. From start to finish there is not a single wasted scene.The harshest of critics of 3D films has said that this film should be viewed in the 3D format. This reviewer followed that advice and was richly rewarded for paying the extra. Some cinemas give out, and collect back in, the 3D glasses. Mine did not. Instead of paying my usual UK£7.50p, I paid £9.60p plus another 80p for the glasses. I saw a great film and get to keep my Sandra Bullock 3D glasses for ever! Before the film I endured some poor 3D film previews. They did not look good but rather unreal. No problem with this film though. The 3D effect really helped in immersing into the film. However it was all the little details that made this film. Watch as the smallest of things float about into your vision and grow bigger and bigger as they approach you. Again it is the details of these smallest of things that complete the effect of putting you in space with Miss Bullock. Weightlessness makes everything float about, and boy does it! Knowing that we are not in space, we are so immersed in this film that we feel that we are. Even get into the head of Miss Bullock as the camera gives a POV from inside her helmet! Be it breathless, or breath-taking, Sandra Bullock delivers a truly, truly, sublime performance. This is film-making at it's very, very, best. This really is a must see 3D, and must see, film. 10/10.",Null,1,2,12 November 2013
World War Z," Family outing ruined by zombie plague.
","What is it!, with fathers? Tom Cruise, almost as soon as he is in charge of his kids, gets caught up in a Martian invasion, in 'War of the Worlds' (2005). Here, Brad Pitt cannot even drive his kids down the road without being swept up in a world-wide zombie plague.This reviewer was offered a choice of 2D and 3D, and decided if the film was good enough it would stand on it's own merits in the 2D format. It did.Film comes from Brad Pitt's own 'Plan B Entertainment' film company and was released via 'Paramount', therefore Brad Pitt is a producer and the film opens with the 'Paramount Mountain'. The rest of the credits are shown with quick views of US urban scenes and TV. Views are partially distorted by clever graphics. Scenes are typical and pleasant. About halfway through though, this reviewer was disturbed to see a few brief seconds of Piers Morgan, and after that the scenes became more sinister, ending with prophecies of doom.The mood changes though when the film proper starts. We are in a suburban house with Gerry and his family. Gerry is played by Brad Pitt. We quickly find out, thanks partially to the TV, that Gerry is a house-husband and that his most important job is making pancakes, however his old job was a lot more dangerous and involved him travelling to dangerous places around the world.After breakfast, Gerry and his family drive through down-town Philadelphia and get caught up in a traffic-jam. They also get caught up as a swarm of zombies engulf this part of town. These scenes are very intense, the pace slackens only after some time, and only then did this reviewer notice their own very accelerated heart-beat.Around St Valentine's Day there was a nice little Rom-com zombie film called 'Warm Bodies', that told the heart-warming story of love conquering all, including zombies. 'World War Z' is not that film. 'WWZ' rather is a fast action horror and thriller (which also makes a few interesting little political points). The only thing that 'WWZ' shares with 'WB' is regarding the speed of the zombies. If, dear reader, your own previous experience of zombies, extends no further than the slow lumbering clumsy zombies, populating the shopping mall, in George A. Romero's 1978 'Dawn of the Dead', (one of a trilogy), then be prepared to be shocked and scared. Like the bonys in 'WB', these zombies can move, and run, very fast indeed. Again, unlike 'DOTD', the gestation period for developing into a zombie is much shortened too in 'WWZ'.The film starts in Philadelphia but there are also scenes of different parts of the world. In reality however many scenes were actually shot in the UK. Most of the opening scenes were shot in Glasgow, Scotland, UK; mostly in and around, George Square. Glasgow, like many North American cities, has a grid-system street layout. So it is then that in a ten minute walk from 'down-town Philly' you can come to the street in 'San Francisco', (this reviewer had always thought 'San Francisco!' for many years), where Halle Berry did some filming for 'Cloud Atlas'. Glasgow also has some interesting buildings that could help it pass for many a European city. Previously the Council's City Chambers on George Square have stood in for the Vatican (in 'Heavenly Pursuits'), as well as the Kremlin (in 'An Englishman Abroad').Some have thought the pace slowed later in the film. This reviewer disagrees. The danger from zombies is always there. It would be ridiculous if this film was just one long chase scene. The film starts, like 'War of the Worlds' with the family caught up in the situation, however unlike that film (which seemed to spend half the time in one cellar, and the rest in the US country-side), this film moves around a lot more, various countries are seen. Seen too are the zombies, who are ready, able, and willing, to chase throughout the film, and do too.Brad Pitt should be rightly proud of this very exciting and scary zombie film, (rated 15 in the UK), that he has produced and starred in. If you liked 'War of the Worlds' or you like zombie films then you will enjoy this. Top marks. 10/10.Health Warning: Beware of zombies! They tend to bite and their bite is usually fatal. When being chased by a zombie, or even seeing zombies moving, you may experience an accelerated heart-beat. Most importantly, take all the necessary precautions you can to avoid being bitten.",Null,26,52,25 June 2013
Passengers," 'We apologize to passengers for the interruption in their journey ...' (standard travel announcement).
","Sleeping passengers are startled to be woken up on their journey to their destination. However, being in a space-ship in space, this story is out of this world, rather than just being another everyday commuter horror story.The film opens, travelling through space, and Chris Pratt being woken from his induced hibernation sleep. Those familiar with the trailer will enjoy seeing Mr Pratt preening himself before he goes off to meet the other passengers, as we know what he does not. There is comedy here, as well as some satire, that will be familiar to mere earthlings experiencing different classes of travel, and trying to work through computer options. As the full reality of his situation dawns on Mr Pratt the film becomes more serious.Chris Pratt in Jurassic World (2015) played a likable action figure, whilst also giving us a comic touch too. Mr Pratt played the role well, though to be fair, it was his character who was responsible for the dinosaurs running amok. Here, in 'Passengers', he again has a role that combines elements of action and comedy. However, there is also much more depth to his character in this film, and Mr Pratt demonstrates this well in some superb acting as he faces his future choices.This reviewer was excited to see this film, but was sadly put off by a critic who revealed a plot twist. However, going to see the film, I was happy to see that the plot twist, which is a major one, and which I believe is best not revealed, is central to the plot of the film, and is rightly dealt with, and explored, in depth. There are one or two other plot twists too, which again are best left to be discovered.Louisville Kentucky gave us 'The Greatest', the three-times World Heavy-weight Boxing Champion Muhammad Ali, (who sadly died in 2016). In 1990 it also gave us another world champion, and star actress, Jennifer Lawrence.Her appearance in 'Silver Linings Playbook' (2012) as a sulky and mad date for the equally mad and sulky Bradley Cooper, who then won his heart with her running and dancing, (as well as Robert De Niro's), was merely one of several tremendous performances in recent years. The three stars, followed that up with 'American Hustle' (2013), and 'Joy' (2015). In 'Hustle' Miss Lawrence again played a border-line mad, and this time, not too smart, but very manipulative wife of Christian Bale. This time last year, she starred in 'Joy' (2016), playing the eponymous real-life inventor of the Miracle-Mop, who was necessarily made of much sterner stuff.Miss Lawrence must be considered amongst the best, if not the best, actress of her generation, and this era. She seems to be able to be truly authentic in her portrayal of her characters, exhibiting true and believable emotions in all of her character dramas. In this film 'Passengers', she again shows us her talent and is rightly billed with the first credit as the star of this film.Miss Lawrence's character, (the appropriately named Aurora), like that of Mr Pratt, wakes up alone, before she meets him. These two humans are alone. It cannot really be said that this film has a cast of thousands, as all the rest are tucked up asleep for the duration of the trip. Our two woken humans face an awful future alone, with only an android barman as company. Barman Arthur, played well by Michael Sheen, will be easily recognized as being like all human barman on planet Earth.'Passengers' thus does have a very small cast, though it does seem a spot bigger than that of 'Gravity' (2013) starring Sandra Bullock and George Clooney. The two films are similar, with both being dramas set in space with a small cast. Having seen both films in 3D, I can say they share excellent production values too. In 'Passengers' the interiors and exteriors of the space-ship are excellent, as too are all the shots of the rest of the universe. Music was excellent. It heightened tension and drama at the appropriate moments, whilst never intruding either.'Passengers', and 'Gravity', have good plots and stories. Sadly, at the end of last year, 'Arrival' (2016), went nowhere, and could be best described by old Mrs Soprano as 'just all a big nothing'. 'Interstellar' (2014), did at least go somewhere initially, however both films were really ruined by silly time-loop stuff.By contrast, 'Passengers' is recommended as a seriously well-made film, with a good story-line, that also raises some thoughtful questions that will need to be addressed before we move from our everyday commuter problems here on Earth to those involved in space-travel.Miss Lawrence, sadly, only teases us with a dance in this film, but the silver-lining is more running, and some swimming too.Whilst the film deals with some adult issues and themes, it's UK rating of 12A, means that it is suitable for a wide range of audiences.Good stuff! 10/10.",Null,1,6,5 January 2017
Star Trek Into Darkness," 'Out-numbered, out-gunned', a starship crew decide 'to boldly go' and 'choose the danger'!
","Generations of earthlings have been brought up following the exploits of the crew of the USS Enterprise (NCC-1701). Star Trek (2009) was set in the early days of the Starfleet Kobayashi Maru training exercise. That J J Abrams film was set in an alternate reality and this new film is too, as it follows on from the earlier film. Thus this is different from the original TV series. Much is familiar but it is also slightly different. J J Abrams said that he wanted to make a film that appealed to old fans as well as those new to the story. Therefore this reviewer would advise older viewers to set aside the older reality and throw themselves into this new one. As the good Doctor would say 'It's life Jim, but not as we know it!'.For some older viewers, the new actors fitted in well to the 2009 film. The single exception being Chris Pine. Growing up with William Shatner as 'the overgrown schoolboy charging around the universe', Pine did not seem to fit. The Shatner incarnation of Captain James T Kirk really seemed to be like an overgrown schoolboy. He had charm, wit and a twinkle in his eye. The Pine reincarnation was a sullen bruiser with no charm. This reviewer was of that position after seeing the 2009 film. However this new film suggests that view was too harsh. Here Pine is starting to become charming. What must be remembered is that these are the early days of Kirk. It takes time for the rebellious, surly and nervous cadet to mature into the Captain at ease with his command. The young man is already a bit of a ladies-man and can comfortably handle rough-house, the rest will come with time. That is only logical.So Pine is good, as are the rest of the crew of the Enterprise. British actor Simon Pegg plays a Scottish engineer, and Benedict Cumberbatch, another Brit., also has a big part. The crew-members all had little scenes that developed their characters. There are interesting relationships between them. All, but one, were very human. Even the one, showed a human side.The Bridge of the Enterprise is very modern-looking. The Engine-room is breathtakingly different from the previous incarnations of an older time. Uniforms tend to stick to the traditional colour-code, however there is a much different look to the uniforms, at first surprising, then interesting.The film title is obscure and thankfully the cinema trailer is misleading and doesn't give away the plot.The film is a fast action SF story. There are chases and shootouts between spaceships as well as humans. There is also some exciting hand-to-hand combat and humour. All the usual ingredients of a Star Trek movie are in this film. However although there are some interesting plot-twists, as a whole, the plot is poor. Thus the film will probably be found more interesting by new viewers of Star Trek, however older viewers may enjoy the tweaks.Having said that, for all those cinema-goers looking for an action movie, for SF fans, and for Star Trek fans, all are recommended 'to boldly go'. However do not go too boldly at the end of the film, as the last film shots and the music, at the end credits, are both well worth waiting for.Warp factor: 9.",Null,3,13,14 May 2013
About Time," Time-travel tale set in the social set of the Sloan-Rangers and Hooray-Henrys.
","A Universal film. Richard Curtis is on familiar territory in this time-travelling rom-com.An Englishman discovers that he can travel in time and uses this to try to get a girl.Those who like the rom-com or time-travel genres will love this film. Director, and Writer, Richard Curtis, has crafted this time-travelling rom-com. It is a natural companion to 'Four Weddings and a Funeral' (1994), and 'Notting Hill' (1999). However, whilst both those films were rated 15, 'Another Time' is rated 12A in the UK. Though there should be no criticism of the film; it is not tame, it is not a kids film, but rather an adult film, for adults, that deals with adult themes. Richard Curtis was the Writer in all three films, but in 'AT' he directs too, unlike the previous two films. Camera work is a little wobbly in earlier shots and some music is a little intrusive. Having said that, the two scenes that really featured music, were both beautifully conceived and filmed.Plot is basic, but to repeat, young man uses time travel to try to get a girl. Some mistakes can be rectified, and futures changed, through the use of time travel. Thus this film is comparable to 'Groundhog Day' (1993). In both films the hero uses time-travel rather selfishly at first, before maturing and using time-travel in a more constructive way. However whilst 'GD' just repeated one day, in 'AT', time-travel is over a longer period of time.Curiously, Andie Macdowall co-starred in 'GD'. It will be remembered that Miss Macdowall was also in the 'FWaaF' Curtis-vehicle. In his two previous films, 'FWaaF' and 'NH', Mr Curtis had an English-gentleman and an American woman meeting in an upper-class environment. This film is again partially set in London as well as out in the country. Again the social-set is very upper class, lots of girls with awfully posh voices, and there is even an American.While the characters are interesting, and even stereo-typical silly things clearly have more going on in their lives than is first thought, the social-set being portrayed is very thin indeed. There has been criticism of Richard Curtis in the past for showing a very limited slice of humanity in previous films. The same applies today with this, his newest film. In a recent interview Mr Curtis said he tried to do an urban-Boston film and realized he couldn't do it, so he went back to what he knew.This is a very good film about the lives of white upper-class liberals, and certainly they will tend to mix with their own kind and set, however it is not acceptable, today, to portray London as a city solely populated by rich whites. There was criticism of the 1999 film 'Notting Hill' for showing Notting Hill as being entirely populated with whites. For the record, Notting Hill has been a very diverse multi-cultural and multi-racial area, for decades, as has been much of London. The Notting Hill Carnival is a vast celebration of Caribbean people and their culture. London also has many, many, working-class people too. Sadly, none of these groups feature in Richard Curtis films at all, except perhaps as menial servers.You would have thought that fourteen years after 'Notting Hill' that Mr Curtis would have given some thought to writing parts for people of colour and working-class people. Sadly not. Sadly, Mr Curtis has learnt nothing in all these years. He is truly colour-blind. He sees no-one else in his rich white world. This reviewer thought criticism of Richard Curtis's earlier films, for being too rich and white, was a bit harsh. Sadly, I now feel that criticism has not been harsh enough. It is a serious flaw of this film, the writing of it, the casting of it, that once again it inhabits an unreal rich white world, that only exists in the head of Richard Curtis.Having said all that however, this is a great film. Like his previous films, again here Mr Curtis gives us once again a beautiful rom-com. The time-travel thing is really just a plot device. The core of this film is about relationships. All sorts of relationships, but boy-meets-girl stuff is of course the central core of this film. From start to end we see a bevy of beautiful babes. So too does our hero. He can time-travel to change the past, change the way he interacts with a girl. For this reviewer, the first time was the best and sweetest, just perfect. However as time goes by life gets more complicated and so does the time travel. As the film progresses our hero faces decisions with great consequences. Ordinary mistakes and time-travel mistakes could have devastating consequences. Viewers will watch tensely as decisions are made. As our time-travel hero tries to learn how to live every day, so too may we. The time-travel theme is not the most important theme, so do not worry about it, accept, don't question, just enjoy a film who's central theme is love.A great supporting cast fill the characters in this film with real life. Rachel McAdams is a real stand out as one of the girls who the time-traveller meets. Domhnall Gleeson is the time-traveller and he too totally convinces as he matures through this film.If you liked 'Four Weddings' and 'Notting Hill', as well as 'Groundhog', and even enjoyed the romantic elements in 'Timecop' (1994), then this is the film for you. Highly recommended. 9/10.",Null,2,7,10 September 2013
Spotlight," '6% act out'
","'Spotlight' has just won the 2016 Oscar for Best Picture, and deservedly so. However, 'Concussion' and 'Trumbo' did not even get nominated, though Bryan Cranston was nominated for his role in 'Trumbo' playing the eponymous communist screen-writer blacklisted by Hollywood. Will Smith playing the doctor who exposed the concussion scandal in American Football, like his film, is sorely neglected, but that is another story. What all three films have in common, is a story of powerful groups exerting their power at the expense of individuals. This seems a common theme and all three films are worthy products telling true stories.'Sleepers' (1996) told a tale of child sexual abuse. The authenticity of that film is much disputed. 'Spotlight', by contrast, is a factually true story, but one that reminded this reviewer of the earlier film because they both deal with the same subject matter. It is interesting to note that Billy Crudup appears in both films.A brief opening sequence, informs the viewer that the subject matter of the film is child sexual abuse committed by Boston priests, as is also quite clear from the trailers. The film then has a pleasant party scene at the Boston Globe newspaper marking the retirement of the newspaper editor. The film moves quickly into gear as the new editor, an outsider from Florida, played by Liev Schrieber, arrives. He meets Michael Keaton who plays the head of the Spotlight team. The editor is informed that Spotlight do long-term investigations, though at the moment they are trolling for work. The editor then tasks them with exploring and expanding on a smaller story of a priest guilty of child sexual abuse.The film that follows is almost totally concentrated on the ensuing investigation. We viewers see the team investigate the matter and realize, through the paper-trail, that this is not just about one priest, and that it is also about a cover-up too. Of the Spotlight team, Michael Keaton plays the cool-headed and practical manager, Mark Ruffalo plays a passionate and obsessed character, and Brian d'Arcy James's role is somewhat similar. Both are concerned with how close the issue is to them. We see this also in Rachel McAdams role too, though she is used more to show the drudgery of the investigation; firstly, as she knock doors, later, as she conducts interviews. All thespians convince in their authentic playing of newspaper investigators, appalled at the story that unfurled, committed to exposing the truth. John Slattery and Liev Schrieber, in smaller parts, play well their roles as overseers.Neal Huff and Michael Cyril Creighton are very impressive in their scenes as they explain grooming and child sexual abuse. It should be said that it is these references, and this subject matter, that gives this film a rating of 15 in the UK. It should also be said that these issues are discussed, but not shown.Mark Ruffalo and Liev Schrieber seem to have gone to some trouble to adopt distinctive accents that surprised this reviewer when first hearing them. Thankfully, the distinctive voice of Stanley Tucci was easily spotted, as he himself was not. He plays a campaigning lawyer who looks a little worn-down and unkempt, perhaps even in need of a haircut, which is why he is a little difficult to spot. Billy Crudup and Jamey Sheridan also play lawyers and Paul Guilfoyle also has a small role.Since the birth of Jesus Christ two thousand years ago, for the first one and a half thousand years there was only one Christian religion. In the last five hundred years the Catholic, or Roman Catholic, Church has still been the premier Christian religion. The church proclaims itself a church of sinners, but it's adherents were shocked to discover that so many, had sinned so much. For many, discovering the extent of sin within, to be precise; the extent of child sexual abuse by priests, and the cover-up by the hierarchy, has sickened them to their stomachs, and produced a crisis of faith. This is shown well in this film.Although a solid film about a newspaper investigation, this is also a sombre film, but one with a spot or two of moments of black humour, surprisingly. It tells the tale of the exposure of the cover-up of child sexual abuse in Boston by priests, a story that the powerful church tried to keep the lid on, but that lid was lifted, and the story went around the world.The story of powerful institutions using their powers at the expense of individuals, and then that power being broken by brave individuals, is one that often makes good material for a movie. This is certainly the case with regard to 'Spotlight'. The same themes are also at play in the excellent 'Concussion' and 'Trumbo', both of which deal with a single individual against a powerful institution, and both of which are worth seeing too. Those who like a good gangster film should know that the recent 'Black Mass' tells the story of the gangster Whitey Bulger, who was exposed as a protected FBI informer by the Spotlight investigation team of the Boston Globe.'Spotlight', which also won an Oscar for Best Original Screenplay, tells an important and true story, that is one that is well worth seeing. 10/10.",Null,8,14,29 February 2016
Begin Again," 'This is not Gerry Maguire' but is a nice film about music and relationships.
","Film opens in a bar. A shy girl, played by Keira Knightley, sings a song. In the audience is a strange looking man played by Mark Ruffalo. The film goes back in time to see how they got there. However, this is not one of those films that starts with the end scene, thus spoiling all the suspense. Here the flashbacks are done well, and cleverly, to quickly bring the viewer back to the bar, and the start of the film. Now we learn why Mr Ruffalo's character looks strange, and why Miss Knightley's character is shy.Mark Ruffalo looks very grizzled and he seems to have got his brash New York character down to a tee, despite not being a native New Yorker himself. Miss Knightley plays well the idealistic song-writer from out-of-town.The plot revolves around them getting together to produce some music. This reviewer was a little concerned that there may be too much music in this film, however this turned out to not be a problem. There are perhaps four major music scenes, one or two of which felt, to me, ever so slightly, too long. However, knowing that the film was about music, I merely gritted my teeth, very gently.Earlier this year, this reviewer saw Miss Knightley in 'Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit' and although playing against Kenneth Branagh, Kevin Costner and Chris Pine, she more than held her own in scenes, some of which were exciting, and some sweet.Miss Knightley prepared thoroughly for her role in 'Begin Again'. IMDb quotes her as saying she was taught guitar by her husband but that it led to disharmony in the relationship. In an interview, Miss Knightley says that she learnt all her lines prior to shooting, but when filming started, Writer/Director John Carney decided to do a lot of improvisation. What were lines, and what was improvisation, is unclear. Certainly the early singing scenes seem authentic and it must be hoped that the sweet-voiced Miss Knightley does have her songs released, in reality, outside of this film.John Carney directs well. The film is meant to be low-budget, but it looks good. It has an almost documentary feel, especially in some of the music scenes. This is conveyed by the camera-work. Small hand-held cameras seem to have been well utilized to give an authentic look. There are none of the dreadful dizzying spinning shots that some directors think are needed to give an authentic documentary look. This is all achieved by the way the cameras are used. There is a street-guerrilla-look to the filming that fits in perfectly with the theme of street-guerrilla music-making and thus gives it authenticity.The main stars are also supplemented by a good supporting cast. James Corden convinces in his role as another musician and the scenes between him and fellow Brit Miss Knightley seem very natural. Mr Ruffalo too has some great scenes with Hailee Steinfeld and Catherine Keener. Again they seem authentic and believable. An early scene with Mr Ruffalo and Miss Steinfeld is one of the funniest in the film. So there is some comedy too, in this film about music. There is also nice interaction between Miss Knightley and Miss Steinfeld.One of the main themes of the film is relationships. Miss Knightley plays a character who seems very sensitive, perceptive and empathetic. Thus through her, we the audience can quickly pick up the vibes and follow the plot. Mr Ruffalo, last year also made 'Now You See Me', in which he played a hard-boiled detective hunting down some bank-robbing magicians, however his character did have some charm. Here too, in this film, Mr Ruffalo gives us charm with his native New Yorker character, who also has a more realistic gritty bad-boy side to him as well.This film about artists at work, and their lives and loves, is one that surpassed my expectations. The relationships were dealt with in a realistic way and the comedy and the music were both pleasant. Perhaps not a rom-com, this is though a nice film, that is both emotional and entertaining, as well as making some comment on current music trends.A good film which surpassed my expectations. 10/10.Warning: Film contains beards. Advice: Stay to see the end-credits.",Null,3,8,14 July 2014
Interstellar," In space, the background music makes you want to scream!
","Director Christopher Nolan's 'Interstellar', has been described as his '2001'. However, this over-long film is spoilt by an excessive amount of 'background', and 'dramatic', music. It is also ruined by the last plot-twist and last-third of the film.The talented Nolan brothers; Christopher and Jonathon, have written the screenplay of 'Interstellar'. They have worked together before, perhaps never better than when Jonathon's short story was taken by Christopher, who then wrote the screenplay, and then directed, 'Memento' (2000). One of the cleverest films ever made! Christopher followed this up by directing 'Insomnia' (2002). Earlier this year he was an executive producer of 'Transcendence', a good film, and one which has some similarities to 'Interstellar'. Jonathon is the producer of the entertaining 'Person of Interest' TV Series.The early scenes in 'Interstellar', and accompanying dialogue, show us an inward-looking planet, dominated by a political-orthodoxy, that reinforces this post-space agrarian society.Star of the film is Matthew McConaughey, who gives a stellar performance, playing a farmer. Mr McConaughey, who gave such a superb performance in 'Mud' (2012), here again gives a convincing performance, this time playing this farming family-man. This is matched by the brilliant performance by Mackenzie Foy, who plays his young daughter. Their scenes together, are very authentic, and some of the best scenes in the film. However, all other family relationships, throughout the film, are equally convincing. They are the very core of this film and are as intense as those in the recent 'The Judge'. There is also good support from Casey Affleck, Michael Caine, Matt Damon, William Devane and John Lithgow, all cast in a variety of small parts and roles.Except for one great scene, there is far too much music in this film. For purposes of realism, extended periods of silence are required. However, it would be unrealistic perhaps to try to condemn a cinema audience to two hours of silence. Sandra Bullock's recent lost-in-space film 'Gravity' seemed to get the balance about right. Sadly,'Interstellar' does not.The plot-twists are good, as is the film, but the final plot twist, and following scenes, killed this film for me. As soon as the twist happened, I just wanted the film to finish as soon as possible. If the film had ended before then, it would have been a good film, as well as being a decent length.The science in this film, is, like the curate's egg, good in parts, and bad in parts, thus making this film unsuitable viewing for physicists and other scientists.Over-long and disappointing! 7/10.",Null,1,4,15 November 2014
American Hustle," 'I feel love.' A love story, well, several, in fact.
","'That's the boat, Donnie.' When FBI Agent Joe Pistone, posing as jewel-thief Donnie Brasco, and attempting to infiltrate the Mafia, wanted to impress Benjamin 'Lefty Guns' Ruggiero of the Bonanno Crime Family, he got the use of 'The Left Hand', a big boat that was being used in an FBI sting-operation called ABSCAM.This film is not about Donny and Lefty, or the boat, or even about ABSCAM, rather it is very loosely based on the sting-operation.Everything that I have heard about this film, the trailers that I saw, everything, made this reviewer want to see this film.Film opens with a couple of studio credits. They look a little old and naff, and combined with the quality and the texture of the film, cause us to be immediately transported back to the seventies. There are no further opening credits, except one, which states 'Some of this actually happened.' Film is actually set right at the end of the seventies and the start of the eighties. In the seventies a device was invented for bald men. It was called 'The comb-over'. The opening shot of the movie is of Irving, a bald man, played by Christian Bale. He adjusts his hair before getting into his role. He is bald, fat, and middle aged. He is also working with Richie played by Bradley Cooper. Another man with an interesting hairstyle. Actress Amy Adams makes up the trio. She too will sport some spiffing hairstyles. Together they are trying to do a business deal, but things are not clear. They are in fact, running a con. Film now backtracks to explain how they got together.This film is like 'Donnie Brasco' (1997). Like that film, this is as much about undercover work by the FBI as it is about the other subject matter. So we see, like FBI Agent Pistone did, the problems associated with running an undercover operation in that era. Decades later FBI Agent Joaquin Garcia, aka 'Big' Jack Falcone of the Gambino Crime Family, would similarly struggle. How Pistone and Garcia must wish they could've sorted out their problems in real-life as happened in this film.The job of the con-artist is to exude confidence, to convince the person they are dealing with, that they are the genuine article, that what you see is what you get, whilst all along it is not. The same applies to undercover-work by FBI Agents. This film, like 'Donny Brasco', has arguments, betrayals, confrontations, and dangerous exposure threats. It is unclear who is conning who.However, we the audience, know more than the actors/players. We know that the con is on. Know too that the FBI is involved. So we know more than the marks and can enjoy seeing the actors in their dual roles. They had dual roles in real-life too. Jeremy Renner has a very poignant role. It was in fact specially written for him due to casting problems. Bale, Cooper, and Renner, were all cast for more than one role. So not only were they acting two roles in one part, in real life they switched parts too. Thus this, in 'American Hustle', was not deliberate, it just happened, but it must enhance the film. So too, that much of the film is improvised, this was deliberate, perhaps it was to capture the feeling of the con. Film then is like a con, it is unclear what will happen next, improvisation is always a possibility.The film was written and directed by David O. Russell who also did the great 'Silver Linings Playbook' of 2012. Both films share that same mix of comedy, drama and romance. Writer/Director Russell also reunites some of the cast of 'SLP'. Jennifer Lawrence who was so good in that, here again gives a superb performance. She plays a young mother who is stupid, sassy, sexy and sultry. The role is comparable to that of Sharon Stone in 'Casino' (1995). We have too, Bradley Cooper of course, who even gives us another dance. Robert De Niro, also puts in an appearance with a great performance.In real-life Christian Bale added over 40LBS to his weight for his role. When Robert De Niro met him he didn't even recognize him. However all actors, with parts large and small, were all great.This film has been described as a 'fictionalization'. A google after viewing the film, showed me that the film is somewhat different from the source material, but not in a major way.In real-life New Jersey has been described as the most corrupt state in the USA. In real-life too, the casinos brought Atlantic City back to life. An era captured well in 'Atlantic City, USA' (1980).In this film the characters are less black and white, less good guys and bad guys. The colouring is much more that of shades of grey. The dividing line is not clear.This is a great film. In the style that Martin Scorsese created, we have apt use of period music. Actors play characters who exhibit much warmth, and as they exude great love to each other, so do we fall in love with them. But be warned: just like Jennifer Lawrence's nail-varnish, this film too is bitter-sweet. We too will experience the highs and lows as do the characters. Having said that there are some nice twists. Some clever twists too. This is after all a con film. So do try to keep your eye on the ball.The only mistakes in this film are, one badly placed moustache (I can thank Donny and Lefty for spotting that) and two badly delivered lines. Not enough to mark this film down for.'Hey, did they get us? We're sitting here, Left. We beat those FBI guys!' The con is on. Enjoy! 10/10.",Null,5,9,7 January 2014
Rush," A film about fast cars and some seventies nostalgia too.
","Film is from StudioCanal who also made 'Senna' (2010). The Director is Ron Howard who in 1995 directed 'Apollo 13'.This film is set in the seventies world of Formula One racing and deals with the rivalry between the drivers Niki Lauda and James Hunt.Film opens appropriately at the start of a race before giving us some back-story. A slightly-bloodied figure, wearing something like an Apollo space-suit, looking something like a Greek god, enters a hospital. He is James Hunt the racing-driver.Chris Hemsworth plays the part of James Hunt. This is the first time this reviewer has seen Chris Hemsworth. He looks like Brad Pitt, he looks and sounds like Roger Moore, he would make a very believable Alexander The Great. He has a big presence and dominates in his scenes.Ever since the gladiators of Ancient Rome, right up to the present time, certain occupations, such as; gladiators, firemen, gangsters, soldiers and racing-car drivers, have held a fascination. Narration by the James Hunt character explains why. The precarious life-style is attractive, exciting and glamorous. It is never explicitly stated why this film is entitled 'Rush'. However the whole film implicitly tells us that it is about the adrenalin-rush that comes from the speed and the life-style. That is what attracts ordinary people and that is what drives the participants. That drug-like addiction to drive and race is shown well.James Hunt came from a comfortable background, but film shows how enthusiastic amateurs, with a modest amount of money, could build their own Formula Three racing-cars in their garages, and then race them. To succeed as a racing-driver though, required the good luck of being talent-spotted, and then sponsored, by rich backers.The young James Hunt meets Niki Lauda played by Daniel Bruhl. Lauda is Austrian,his character has a Germanic-like intensity which is the complete opposite of the debonair Hunt. Lauda is obsessed, in a German-engineering way, in the technical side of racing. A workaholic who expects the same from those around him. By contrast Hunt is a playboy, driven to drive, driven to take risks, but also happy to indulge fully in the life-style made possible by his occupation. The interplay between the two drivers is both entertaining and intense. The competition between their different philosophies is at the heart of this drama.Other drivers are just nameless faces in the background, and it is correct that this is so, as anything else would distract from the central struggle between the two drivers. There is one exception; Clay Regazzoni. He it was, who in real-life, contributed in a very important way to this story. This is not clear in the film but it is right that he features in it. Perhaps this is a tribute to him. Certainly he would be a worthy subject of a film himself. He is played, superbly, by Italian actor Pierfrancesco Favino.The actor with the top -billing in this film is Daniel Bruhl who plays Niki Lauda. He is the real star of the show. Chris Hemsworth showed well the intensity of the desire to drive by James Hunt, but playing a good-looking sex-symbol did not stretch him to the extent as did the Niki Lauda role for Daniel Bruhl. Much more was asked of him, and he delivered.This movie was filmed in such a way as to give us a truly authentic rich-colour seventies feel to it. All other seventies details strike an authentic note too. Younger viewers may be shocked to see hospital staff smoking, but yes, smoking was as ubiquitous as it is shown in this film. Cars, vans, haircuts and jackets too, all looked in place. Some contemporary seventies music, placed Scorsese-like, in the background, also hit the spot.Familiar with the seventies, this reviewer recently revisited them, when I went to see 'The Battle of the Sexes', a documentary about the famous tennis match. I was unsure the details of this event and was happily reminded of the seventies decade. I knew the general story of the documentary 'Senna' and so decided to avoid it. With the 'Rush' story, I knew the general details, but not the finer details, and so was genuinely excited about how things would turn out in the film. The second-half of this film is almost totally about the racing and it is very exciting.All racing-enthusiasts should enjoy this film. However there is something here for people of all tastes. Director Ron Howard, like he did in 'Apollo 13', has been able to take a true story, and craft it into a great drama. While sexual-athlete James Hunt does engage in a lot of soulless sex (see the mirror), this film does also have time for romance too. Film is at times very emotional, and as the film progresses, the two protagonists find out things about each other, so do we. The recent 'About Time' was a celebration of life, so too is this film. The decade of the seventies was crazy, dangerous and wild. 'Ayds helps you slim' was then merely an advertising slogan for a slimming product. James Hunt was the largest of those larger-than-life characters. Niki Lauda by contrast was the process-obsessed technician with an iron-will but perhaps the most human. Brad Pitt's Achilles in 'Troy' (2004), said that the gods envied us for the way we lived our lives. Too true. Enjoy life, enjoy the rush, enjoy this film. Magnificent! 10/10.",Null,2,3,18 September 2013
Nightcrawler," It gets very dark, at night, on the streets of the asphalt jungle.
","Jake Gyllenhaal plays a sharp-minded, amoral, small-time criminal and hustler, who aspires to something more. This happens, through a chance encounter, which brings him into contact with TV news.Jake Gyllenhaal was born in LA, and is the brother of actress Miss Maggie Gyllenhaal. Mr Gyllenhaal has appeared in a couple of really exciting films in recent years; the time-travel SF film 'Source Code' (2011), and the LA-based cop drama 'End of Watch' (2012). In both of those films Mr Gyllenhaal played, with much poignancy, a sympathetic, and somewhat tortured, character. This film is equally exciting, but Mr Gyllenhaal's character in this film is different. Always intense, in this film, Mr Gyllenhaal lost 20lbs in reality, to give himself a hungry-look.Rene Russo co-stars in 'Nightcrawler', she plays a news-executive at a TV station. Thus her role is somewhat like that of Faye Dunaway in 'Network' (1976), and the two films are somewhat alike as they expose the seedy underbelly of the morality of TV news gathering. This thus, is a serious role for Miss Russo. This film is made in the shadow of Hollywood, but it is a world away from the glitzy Hollywood portrayed in 'Get Shorty' (1995), a comic film-making gangster-caper, in which Miss Russo played the romantic love-interest. This is of course not to say that Miss Russo cannot do serious. That same year of 1995, she gave a tremendous performance in 'Outbreak', followed up the next year by her equally well acted role in 'Ransom'.In real-life, Miss Russo, is married to Dan Gilroy, the writer and director of 'Nightcrawler'. This is the debut film of Mr Gilroy and he should be applauded for his creation. The story is good and the filming too. All 'news-footage' had an authentic look to it, similar to the found-footage of 'End of Watch'. It should be noted that Mr Gyllenhaal is a producer of 'Nightcrawler'. Thus both films have Mr Gyllenhaal's character filming in the film, and both films are LA-based too. Actors Bill Paxton and Rick Garcia in the supporting cast, also give strong performances.The only thing wrong with this film was the trailer run to promote it. The recent 'A Most Wanted Man' was partially ruined by it's trailer. Here too, some severe editing of the trailer, by Jake Gyllenhaal's film character, would not have gone amiss in this regard.Ultimately, this film is a depressing look at the cynicism and immorality of TV news-gathering.Exciting and tense. 9/10.",Null,1,4,3 November 2014
Oblivion," Boring, clichéd, derivative, SF action film starring Tom Cruise.
","Is this meant to be a comedy? If so it was very good. Alas, I fear it was not. It should have been made as one and if it was, it would have been more enjoyable. Perhaps instead it was a knowing Tarantino-like nod to classic films in one genre, with other genres thrown in and all referenced in the film. Perhaps not.There is nothing in this film that is original. Nothing whatsoever. Everything in this film is borrowed from some other film or some other film franchise (a term I do not like using but have to here). Most of the ideas in this film have been used in other SF films. The films cannot be named as this would constitute as major plot-spoiling. Two major film franchises have been used for source material, one massively, I dare not even name the star or the genre. Tom Cruise films have even been scavenged. At least two. Well at least that is appropriate. I count at least four SF films that have been scavenged. Romance and suspense genres have also been dipped into.Film stars Tom Cruise. He has his all-American good looks and his wry smile. Film opens with his narration and with his rambling conversations to himself and his work colleague. This gives you the background to the story of the earth being destroyed and this couple living up in the sky. All this talk is irritating but at least Cruise is believable as a somewhat lonely man, on his own a lot, who talks to himself a lot.Tom Cruise is an engineer and pilot. His colleague, played by Andrea Riseborough, works the controls back at base. This base is up in the sky and is a very clean and sanitised place, that contrasts starkly with the grim Earth below. This brave new world base is stunning. The controls stuff is boring but the domestic scenes are the best part of the film. There is much chasing, fighting and flying. All done well. This reviewer had upgraded to the tilting seats and so this probably enhanced those scenes. Feel the vibration when the plane takes off! Having said that, the chasing and flying scenes were very derivative. Praise where praise is due, all the special-effects were stunning, as were the locations. Some of the outside location-shots were truly breath-taking but again sadly somewhat derivative.The acting is good. Tom Cruise is good (OK TC). For some reason Andrea Riseborough is listed fourth in the cast. She should be second. We see a lot more of her here than we do in the recent 'Welcome to the Punch'. More, longer and more depth. A much bigger part which she fills well. With this and 'Punch' both being so unoriginal, it must be hoped that she can get the chance to be in better films. Olga Kurylenko, too, gave a moving performance. Both females were wasted though by this script in which everything was telegraphed. Words, plots, twists, all could be guessed at and predicted before they happened. All thespians old and young performed well.All problems with this film can be safely left at the door of the writer/director Joseph Kosinski. Final credits state film came from a graphic novel. IMDb states the novel idea came from Kosinski. He was born in 1974, thus is nearly forty years old but you would think he was half that age. Has he not seen any films?I was not born in 1935 but I have seen the film from that year by Alfred Hitchcock entitled 'The 39 Steps', starring Robert Donat. I have also seen the Kenneth More and Robert Powell versions. Why do I mention this? I can safely mention that a good way into the film there is a small scene which would have Richard Hanney shouting 'Been there, done that!'. I merely say that this film is just so very, very familiar.In the UK it is rated 12A. In the opinion of this reviewer, this is because nobody over the age of 12 should be allowed to see it. Even those 15-18 years-old will find it derivative.Have heard secret reports leaking out that a 4th version of 'The 39 Steps' is to be made. I look forward to Richard Hanney once more shouting out 'What are the 39 Steps?' but that of course is another story.If you are going to see 'Oblivion' and you have never seen another film before, you will love it. Those who have seen more films will like it less. Comedies and romances must keep to the rules of their genre. Nice guys get laughed at when they are in trouble but then they get out of it. That couple who are right for each other will eventually get together. Do action films just have standard actions and plots that are endlessly repeated? This one does!At the risk of being repetitive about this deeply, deeply unoriginal film, there is nothing in this film that is original. Nothing at all. Therefore this can only be described as a fairly good to average action film and thus is marked 5/10.",Null,4,12,16 April 2013
The Revenant," An epic story of attempted survival in the very very wildest of the Wild West.
","An exciting trailer made 'The Revenant' a must-see film. The title required a search to understand it's meaning. Neither is required though before seeing this film. In fact viewers are best advised to avoid both. The trailer does in fact show too much, thus diminishing the level of suspense.The film opens with the familiar icon and music of 20th Century Fox. The film itself is a Western, who's opening scenes shows a very wet and heavily-forested landscape that seems primeval and virtually unpopulated. White trappers are attacked by American Natives (formerly known as Red Indians, though that is geographically incorrect), and in attempting to escape, take a decision, that has momentous consequences. There follows a struggle to survive in the harsh and grim environment, which centres on one of the trappers.The star of the film is Leonardo DiCaprio who plays the role of Hugh Glass. He is not just a trapper, but also appears to be a guide and hunter too. He is accompanied by his son, Hawk, played by Native American Forrest Goodluck, in a good debut performance. The son of white man Glass and a Red Indian mother, his character is thus a half- caste, and as such, viewed as alien by others. This harsh racist view of 'the savage' is shown well throughout the film, but American Natives themselves play several important roles within the film itself. One in particular, plays a role that will be easily recognized by those familiar with classic Westerns.Some clever use of dreams and memories give some back-story, but not enough. Interjected, like scenes from the Sopranos, they are surreal and thus take you out of the picture somewhat. More sadly, they never give the back-story as to the circumstances of Hugh Glass meeting an Indian woman and them then having a child. Trapper Glass has a story of wanting to escape civilization and enjoy the silence of the wilderness. Sadly we do not experience it, because the other flaw in the film is the constant insertion of background music. Some, seems to fit in with the time-period appropriately, but there is far too much of lots of other music. More silence, as people trudged through the snow or trees split in the cold, and thus those sounds being caught, would have been better. However, these two drawbacks, should not detract from what is a masterful piece of film-making by Director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu. From the earliest scenes we have innovative camera shots that pull us into the movie. The camera is used to present some great POV for us in some early fighting scenes, that really give us the effect of being there during the fight. This also continues in later parts of the film. Likewise, we can have the camera turning to show a character isolated in the wilderness, though never blurring as happens in so many other films, nor making us giddy either. There are also some very long tracking scenes, as well as some innovative filming from ground-level too. All-in-all, Director Alejandro Inarritu gives us a master-class in filming.It should be said that the cast and crew of the movie were filming in very inhospitable locations for months. Conditions must have been very harsh, and all concerned should be very proud of the commitment and dedication required to do this. Leonardo DiCaprio, in particular should be applauded. He is in virtually every scene, thus his workload, and suffering, must have been more than that of the other thespians.Playing opposite Leonardo DiCaprio, after he persuaded him to read the screenplay, is British actor Tom Hardy. Fresh from showing his acting talents playing both of the Kray Twins in 'Legend' (2015), here in 'The Revenant', he plays a rough tough experienced trapper. His 2012 outing as a hillbilly moonshiner in 'Lawless' showed his ability to authentically convince as an American, which he does again here in this film. Captain Henry, the nominal leader of the trappers, is played by Domhnall Gleeson. His accent was good and he convinced in his role. In 2015 he had another serious role in 'Ex Machina', much different from his role in the rom-com 'About Time' made in 2013. British actor Will Poulter also did a comedy in 2013, 'We're the Millers', here in 'The Revenant' he too plays his part with distinction. A supporting-part that is a spot bigger and meatier than Domhnall Gleeson's, though both are good.There is a clear intent to portray Native Americans authentically as well as sympathetically, thus we have use of subtitles for Pawnee as well as French, although the majority of the film is in English. We are perhaps now seeing a revival of the 'Western' genre, after a long gap. 2014 saw a good and also gritty cowboy film called 'The Salvation'. 'The Revenant' is interesting because it shows an era, the era of the fur-trapper, that is an earlier era, and one that is rarely dealt with in the Western genre.'The Revenant' has to be considered one of the finest pieces of film- making yet, both for cast and crew. The dedication required for filming in the harsh conditions, as well as the resultant piece of work, make it unrivaled. 8/10.",Null,0,3,19 January 2016
We're the Millers," Drug-dealer needs family for drug-run in this crude comedy.
","A local drug-dealer does a good turn and is then forced to do a drug-run.The drug-dealer is an ex-college drug-dealer who has never grown up. Whilst others have settled down with families or become big business-men, this guy is still dealing. Just like John Goodman in 'Flight', this guy goes around dispensing happiness. This drug-dealer though, is not as flamboyant as Goodman, he dresses down, he is anonymously scruffy so that he fits into his environment.He is a busy, content, friendly, happy-go-lucky, single guy. However his life is turned upside down by a single event and he faces the daunting prospect of 'going down ol' Mexico way' to pick up a drug consignment and smuggle it back into the USA.Realizing he requires a disguise, the drug-dealer has a 'eureka' moment, and decides that he needs a family. So it is then that this is how the Miller family came into existence. This was the plan, but when he tried to get the family together, there was some reluctance. Mr Miller, a regular all-American working-stiff, is of course in reality this drug-dealer. Mrs Miller is really a hard-up stripper, Master Miller is an abandoned kid, and Miss Miller is a homeless kid. However, together, they are 'The Millers'.In the recent '2 Guns' the plan was to go to Mexico to get drugs, but that did not happen, and instead the film veered off in another direction. However, in 'We're the Millers', this is where the drug-smuggling plot starts and continues. In 'WTM', the drug consignment is picked up, however things do not proceed as planned.A brief appearance by Luis Guzman is just one of many problems faced by the Millers. If you enjoyed the gross sex-scene in 'Identity Thief', then you are going are going to love this film, as sex rears it's ugly head, again, and again, and again. NB. In the UK this is rated at 15.'IT' is an inferior film to 'WTM', as it relied on a nasty woman destroying a nice guy as the subject matter for generating humour. 'WTM' is also superior to both '2 Guns' and 'The Heat' because it is just a comedy. As such therefore the mood is never dampened by the intrusion of realism. This is not an action-comedy but a comedy played strictly for laughs. This does not mean there is an absence of bad guys however; there are bad guys!, and they act bad!, and look bad! Some have questioned the ability of Jennifer Aniston to play a stripper. However, this film is not about the ability of Miss Aniston to dance like a stripper, but rather it is about her playing the character of a stripper, who is in turn playing the role of an all-American mom. This is the central part, and joy of this film, all of the Millers are in fact playing two roles, and it is in the contrast between the two roles, in which much of the comedy lies.The Millers are a perfect family and all members of the family play their twin-roles perfectly. The supporting cast members too, are, without any exceptions, great. Suspension of belief is almost total. As a scene develops the Millers seem doomed to be exposed, or even just doomed. Now the audience doubts 'but surely ...', but as the tension builds to a conclusion, total suspension of belief is restored, as the Millers escape, or explain, and the plot veers off into another direction.Taste is a subjective matter, however this reviewer, before going to the cinema, had heard other reviews, which stated that this comedy is not funny. Wrong! Do not listen to those bad-mouthing this film. After the first few minutes, this reviewer howled with laughter right through the film, as did the rest of a packed audience.So!, climb aboard with the Millers, and share their journey! This comedy road movie is much funnier than 'IT', 'TH' or '2G'. Meet, and get to know, the family. Find out the back-story to the greeting 'We're the Millers'! This crude, funny, gross, comedy is a must see! A perfect film from start to finish. At the end there are also a few out-takes too. 10/10.Warning: This film is very funny but viewers are advised not to try to replicate the scenes from this film, either at home, or abroad.",Null,0,1,2 September 2013
Now You See Me," An entertaining, exciting, fast, fun, and funny, magic show.
","Film opens and introduces us to three male street-magicians, in reality just street hustlers, and one female, who at least has the distinction of performing her tacky show in a proper venue. They meet up. They know each other, at least by reputation, although two have worked together before on magic shows. Together, they create a magic show that takes them to Las Vegas. Here they perform their magic show with a magic act that teleports a member of the audience into a bank vault, then transports the money to the show. Yes!, the bank has really been robbed!, by magic! Enter, the forces of law and order, who then arrest our magicians. The rest of the film is a battle of wits between the magicians and the forces of law and order.The early part of the film has our street magicians working their magic while engaging in fast, and smart, patter. A little irritating, but not half as irritating as the always moving, spinning, and swirling, of the camera. Thankfully, this calms down somewhat after a while. So stick with it in this early phase because viewing will become more comfortable, although the pace does not slacken during the film.There are car-chases, and other chases, fights, magic-fights, funny magic-fights, funny scenes and magic scenes. Enjoy the magic. Enjoy the magic show. 10/10.",Null,2,6,9 July 2013
Legend," Cor blimey! Stone the crows! A diabolical liberty is taken of the Kray Twins as their gangster life is turned into a love story!
","There have been major criminals in London over the years. However, only two groups of criminals have ever become iconic, legendary and mythic. One lot were 'The Great Train Robbers' whose one big crime and long, long, aftermath, gave them immortality. The other lot were 'The Krays', a gangster family who were the closest British thing to the Mafia, and who comported themselves throughout their lives in such a way, that they created their own legend. Hence the title of this film. The Krays and the Trainrobbers have influenced crime in London ever since, be it culturally, or in the actuality, in other gangs such as the blaggers of the 1980's.'The Krays' (1990), was a decent gangster film that starred real- life pop-star brothers Gary Kemp and Martin Kemp. Fairly accurate, it suffered from being shown from the POV of Violet Kray, the mother, and thus had women making speeches about swans and other nonsense.Therefore this reviewer looked forward to this new version of the story, especially as it was said to be based on John Pearson's book 'The Profession of Violence, The Rise and Fall of the Kray Twins'. An added attraction was the actor Tom Hardy being in the film. The earlier film had used twins to play the twins, an obvious move, now in retrospect an even more obvious idea was used. In this film Tom Hardy plays Reginald Kray, and Ronald Kray is played by Tom Hardy.Director Brian Helgeland who also wrote the script based on the book, had attempted to recruit Mr Hardy to play Reggie. However he was much more interested in playing Ronnie. The obvious solution was found!What was of concern, was the information put out, that the film was to be narrated in the voice of Frances Shea, the wife of Reggie. And so, sadly, it turned out to be. From the opening scene, we have an awful narration. It is so inappropriate! It turns the film into a hagiography. We even have some cod-Marxist class analysis as well as lots of pathetic loved-up philosophical meanderings. Thus the film is transformed from what could have been a good gangster film into a love story. If Frances Shea had declared that there were three people in her marriage, it would have fitted in well with the overall tone.Film is set accurately in the London of the Swinging Sixties in which the Krays were an integral part. This is shown well. Sadly lacking from this film, is a Scorsese- like soundtrack, that captures the music of the era. Location shooting was generally good as were the period details. However, the real-life Blind Beggar pub exterior, is much grander, and more prominently located on a main street. The stand-in is stuffed down a street so little, it looks like an alley.Tom Hardy is superb in his two roles. Ronnie is truly terrifying. Reggie too, carries menace. Mr Hardy's appearance as both brothers is very good. Those familiar with the iconic photos will be amazed at the likeness. Scenes with both brothers was part of the attraction of the film. These scenes are all shot superbly. Mr Hardy convinces in each role and is the embodiment of each twin. Recollection of a short interview long ago of the twins, suggests that Mr Hardy has captured their voices well too. If the narration of Frances Shea is bad, her portrayal by Emily Browning is superb. A brilliant and moving performance. Most of the film deals with the relationship of Frances and Reggie. Frances, so fragile, is stifled by the gangster life. Reggie is torn between his love for Frances and for his brother Ron too. Frances wants Reggie to go straight. Ronnie models himself on Al Capone. Reggie is torn between the two. As this film concentrates on the love angle, it is not really much of a gangster film. Rated as 18 in the UK, it actually has less bloody violence than the recent 'American Ultra' which has a UK 15 rating. 'Legend' does have three violent and bloody fight scenes. About half of the events in the Kray story are in this film, though often needlessly fictionalized, and chronology is not good. As film progresses you wonder what is going to be left out. As you finally assume something is left out, it's popped in. The fictionalization is often so unnecessary. For example, the early scene leaving the hospital is just so less interesting than what happened in real- life. This should have been an ultra violent gangster film that showed the violent world of the Krays. The violence in the film is downplayed thus making it nicer and more entertaining. A major flaw!It was an interesting idea to make this a film about Frances Shea. However this follows the earlier film about Violet Kray. Sure, both women played an important part in the lives of the twins. However this is not the most interesting aspect of the lives of the twins. In this film the differences between the twins is emphasized. However, their similarities is another aspect that deserves attention. Most of all, we are still in need of a definitive Kray gangster film.There is not enough use made of the John Pearson source material. In fact, much has been fictionalized and rewritten. A shame! The Pearson book is considered the definitive work. He was hired to write an authorized biography which morphed later into it's more revealing shape. Charlie Kray's second edition of his own book is more revealing than the untruthful first edition. Leonard Reed has also collaborated with James Morton on a book.However, for a final comment about the violent and feared Kray Twins, the book by Frank Cater, tells the story of a terrified girl trying to escape a car and screaming 'You're not from Scotland Yard! You're from THEM!A diabolical liberty! 7/10.",Null,2,5,14 September 2015
Gone Girl," Amazing Amy and her horrible husband.
","This Twentieth Century Fox film was directed by David Fincher, who has previously directed 'Se7en' (1995), 'The Game' (1997), 'Fight Club' (1999) and 'Panic Room' (2002).This reviewer, having seen the trailer, thought that the plot about a man whose wife goes missing, offered nothing new. Planning not to watch it, I was advised instead to go and see it.Gillian Flynn wrote both the novel and the screenplay. New Orleans born Reese Witherspoon, seen in the recent 'Mud' (2012), is a producer. The film is partially set in southern USA.Film opens with some slow scenes, which are often very yellowy in colour, the music is rather intrusive, the male and female leads are both rather bland and uninteresting. Thus these early scenes in the first-half of the film, did not fill me with confidence.Having seen the trailer, and been put off by it, when I decided to go, I looked at the plot of the missing wife, looked at the possible scenarios, and made my call. About half-way through the film, I realized that I had called it right. However, dear reader, I had been lulled into a false sense of security. This was merely the starting point, as the film then went off in different directions. Nothing less should have been expected from Director David Fincher, and this film is on a par with his previous work, so prepare for the earlier blandness to give way to complexity.The plot has the husband Nick Dunne, played by Ben Affleck, returning home to find his wife missing. He calls the police and a search gets under way. At first kidnap is suspected, but later husband Nick is suspected of murdering his own wife. The wife Amy is played by London-born Rosamund Pike. Whilst both start with rather bland performances, which I now realize must have been deliberate, as the complexity develops, so too does their acting. Mr Affleck has given great performances in 'Argo' (2012), in 2009 in 'He's Just Not That Into You' and 'State of Play', and in 1997 in 'Good Will Hunting' and by strange coincidence was also in a film called 'Chasing Amy'.Neil Patrick Harris of the 'How I Met Your Mother' TV series has a small part. So too does Tyler Perry, another New Orleans-born actor, who reminded me of Seinfeld's Phil Morris playing Jackie Chiles, who is a parody of the real-life Johnny Cochran. While not as funny as the Jackie Chiles character, Mr Perry's character is entertaining whilst also convincing. Mr Perry's 2012 'Alex Cross' was also convincing but that film was spoilt by poor action scenes.Whilst good performances were given by both Mr Harris and Mr Perry, 'Gone Girl' has some really good and strong female characters. Kim Dickens, Lola Kirke, Casey Wilson, and Emily Ratajkowski who is another London-born actress, all gave good performances. However, for me, the stand-out performance of the film was from Carrie Coon, who plays a sister. Her acting was utterly convincing throughout the film. The interaction between the siblings was also totally believable and realistic.The 'Gone Girl' game-plan, like that Brad Pitt thought he had in 'Se7en', like that Michael Douglas thought he had in 'The Game', is not what it seems. For once the trailers show you what you are expecting to see, then the film twists your preconceptions like a pretzel.Film contains a fair bit of sexual and violent content, and plenty of blood, hence it's UK 18 rating, but also a spot of humour that the audience enjoyed too.If you have enjoyed the work mentioned previously of actor Ben Affleck and Director David Fincher, then 'Gone Girl', despite a slightly bland title, is an entertaining and exciting film, on a par with their previous work, and thus well worth seeing. 8/10.",Null,0,7,13 October 2014
The Theory of Everything," A brilliant mind and a broken body: More life and love, than religion and science.
","A 'Universal' film. Btw, is the 'Universal' logo getting even more impressive in recent years?'The Theory of Everything', 12A, 123mins, is a film about the life of the renowned scientist Dr Stephen Hawking, played by Eddie Redmayne, and his wife Jane Hawking, played by Felicity Jones. Both stars give superb performances. Mr Redmayne has rightly just won an award for his role.The film, based on the book by Jane Hawking, focuses on the relationship of the couple. They meet at university but their relationship is quickly dominated by Dr Hawking's illness and physical decline.The early university scenes authentically capture the period. The later scenes of illness brutally capture that reality too. The resilience of the human spirit over adversity is a major theme.This film is a good companion piece to the other recent 'genius' film, 'The Imitation Game', starring Benedict Cumberbatch as Dr Alan Turing, the breaker of the Enigma code, and the father of computers. Mr Redmayne beat Mr Cumberbatch to an award. Both acted well, however the character of Dr Hawking is a much more human and warm character, than that of the colder, less human, and less sympathetic Dr Turing.'The Theory of Everything' also beats 'The Imitation Game' in one important respect, namely that 'Theory' is almost completely chronological, whereas 'Imitation' moves back and forth in a very disjointed way. 'Imitation' would have been so much better set out chronologically. 'Theory' Director James Marsh, however, is not slavishly devoted to chronology. Time is a central part of the film, and the science in the film, and Director Marsh cleverly tweaks his chronology for this reason.The science in 'Theory', like in 'Imitation', is dealt with in a way that is simply explained, and easily followed. Fans of 'The Big Bang Theory' know that the science never gets in the way of the story, and this is true also of 'The Theory' film. 'Big Bang' fans also know that intellectual struggle can easily be portrayed by holding a piece of chalk in front of a black-board. So too in this film. Incidentally, Dr Stephen Hawking, in real-life, has made several guest-appearances on 'Big Bang', playing himself.Simon McBurney, in a small part, gives good support.While this film is about a scientist, science does not dominate the film. As the film is about a man who suffered problems with his mobility and his physical condition, from an early age, it is necessarily a slow film.In this film we learn a little bit about our universe and Dr Hawking's contribution to our understanding of it. We learn also about the man, and his wife. We learn too about life and love.In essence this is a story about love. 10/10.",Null,1,2,12 January 2015
Ex Machina," The Turing Test and the Evitable Conflict.
","Q/ Who made me? A/ God made me. Q/ Why did God make me? A/ God made me to know him, to love him, and to serve him in this world ...Well, I never thought I would open a film review with that, but it did seem appropriate. I could not locate the source material, but, thank God, my memory is still good.A Universal film. 'Ex Machina' is an SF film about a robot. Caleb, played by Domhnall Gleeson, is a young man working in a high-tech company. He is notified that he has won a competition. The prize is to spend a week at the home of the owner of the company. The company owns 'The Blue Book', the most popular search-engine on the internet. The owner of the company is Nathan, played by Oscar Isaac. Nathan is a recluse living in a far-north wilderness. He is also a genius, has a bulked-up body, and a big beard that any naval-person would be proud of, as well as a character that is somewhat controlling, overbearing, and sinister.Nathan informs Caleb that the real reason he is here is to do a Turing Test. Caleb is introduced to a robot, called Ava, played by Alicia Vikander. Nathan has been trying to develop AI. Now Caleb is the first person to find out what Nathan has been working on.The film revolves around the two males and the robot. Thus this is a slow film, it is a character-study rather than an action film. The film was written and directed by Alex Garland. This is in fact his directorial debut, and a very good debut it is too. The early high- tech office scenes looked authentic, the outside scenes were spectacular, as were the special-effects.The three stars of the film give sterling performances. Mr Isaac is sufficiently dark and brooding. Mr Gleeson, who starred with Rachel McAdams, in the 2013 time-travelling rom-com 'About Time', here has a straight role as an earnest and innocent young man. And as for Miss Vikander, this is the second week running that I have seen her in a starring role, last week I saw her play Vera Brittain in 'Testament of Youth'. In Ex Machina, she plays the robot called Ava. This is a difficult role, but one that she plays well. She is required to not only be a machine-like robot, but also to be able to interact with the humans. Can she interact and learn? Does she have AI? These are the central questions explored in the film.Those familiar with the robot books of Isaac Asimov, or the films 'Her' (2013), The Imitation Game (2014), or the iconic 'Blade Runner' (1982), will recognize the similar themes explored here in 'Ex Machina'. Those unfamiliar with them will not have their enjoyment stopped or their understanding denied.'And that is all. I saw it from the beginning, when the poor robots couldn't speak, to the end, when they stand between mankind and destruction'. -Dr. Susan Calvin, in the robot short-story 'The Evitable Conflict'.'Ex Machina' is an interesting and well-filmed SF movie. 10/10.",Null,27,51,26 January 2015
Lincoln," A Really, Bo Really! Big Hollywood Blockbuster Epic about parliamentary procedures.
","Like many in the UK, this reviewer puts aside Friday afternoon, to help decide, what to see next at the cinema.Two films out just now deal with the issue of slavery. One is 'Django'. For me the person who made that film rates as highly as Welles. Yes! His last film, chronologically speaking, that I liked, was 'Jackie Brown'. That choice was discarded.Listening to an interview with Steven Spielberg, decided for me, what to watch. Nothing else was considered or even looked for. Spielberg said that he had wanted to make the film for about a decade, that he thought only Daniel Day-Lewis could play the lead role, he was the only choice, and that it had taken a decade to get him on board for the project. Seeing the film you realize why. DDL is the living embodiment of Abraham Lincoln. The resemblance is uncanny.A large audience, not young people, but a more mature, knowledgeable and thoughtful audience, sat in a large hall, to see this film. A film which is not an action film or a war film, but is a film about history and politics.It tells the story of a place called the United States of America, but one very different from the one we know. In this USA, civil-war has been raging for four years, a long bloody war. The issue at the core of this war is that of slavery. Lincoln is the President. He is a war-time leader. He is a Republican. In this USA, the Republicans are on the left, their support is in the north in the big urban centres and they tend to support the abolition of slavery. The Democrat Party support is rural, is in the south, is King Cotton, and thus is more supportive of retaining slavery.In other ways, this USA is also very different. It is a very primitive society compared to today, certainly in communications. The politics too is somewhat different to today. It is much more face-to-face. More up close and personal. More raw and immediate. The film concentrates on the Capitol, but small-town politics always intrudes too. Perhaps this is like it still is in small towns everywhere or perhaps how it was in Athens and Rome long ago.The film is essentially about President Lincoln at this time as he deals with the issues of slavery and the war, and how he goes about his business. We see more of him than this however. We see Lincoln the family man, we also see a plain-speaking folksy man at home in small-town America, at home talking to the ordinary people, and the exalted. Lincoln the storyteller. Little is seen and heard of his oratory, what there is, is enough. What is seen clearly is Lincoln the lawyer. The film demonstrates why the profession of lawyer has always been intertwined with politics from the earliest days. Clearly there was no one better than Lincoln at using his lawyer's mind to weigh the argument, to define precisely, and to take what has been said and to balance that with what needs to be done.The central part of the film deals with the attempt to try to abolish slavery while the war itself is still raging. All of the different, and competing, arguments are heard as the issue is debated. The film has an all-star cast. DDL is great. He is Lincoln. The film is very emotional, but perhaps the most moving, most noble and most poignant scenes were those with Tommy Lee Jones. He plays an extremist, unswerving in his views, who plans and plots to try to achieve his objective.This heavy-on-the-mayo, epic, Hollywood, blockbuster-film is a must see for all constitutional, historical and political anoraks everywhere. After the first few minutes the film is gripping. It would be churlish to mark this film down for the first five minutes, hence it has to be a 10/10.",Null,0,4,30 January 2013
The Imitation Game," The Enigma puzzle and the enigmatic genius.
","There is a film called 'Enigma' (2001), which is an action-adventure romp about code-breaking. It is a good film, worth watching, but perhaps a somewhat over-dramatised, and fictionalized, version of real-life events. 'The Imitation Game', whilst also using dramatic license, still retains much that is true, with few changes, to tell us a true story from World War II. It had remained secret until 1974. Film also puts centre-stage, Alan Turing, who played such a crucial part. As such therefore, this film, whilst having less action, is more down-to-earth and serious, and truthful, and thus is the better film.The film opens with some very good early scenes, that convey well the upheaval caused by the outbreak of the war. The crowd scenes are nothing new, but as time goes by, it must be harder to get the period details correct. The opening scenes, have that authenticity, as well as conveying the great social upheaval of the war. Not so much exciting, but rather impactful and panoramic. Good filming! Also seen in these early scenes is Londoner Benedict Cumberbatch, playing mathematician Alan Turing heading off for an interview. These early scenes, set the style for the rest of the film. Those fans of the TV comedy series 'The Big Bang Theory', featuring Jim Parsons as the obsessed socially-awkward genius Dr. Sheldon Cooper, will know what to expect, and will enjoy the comic similarities. Throughout much of this otherwise serious film, the tone is lightened by the behaviour of Alan Turing. Mr Cumberbatch may be playing a 'Cooper'-type character, but his portrayal is serious, and also so convincing, that we are utterly convinced that he is not playing, but is in fact, Alan Turing. The character is complex, the acting is of the very finest.Another fine performance is given by Keira Knightley playing the leading-female role of real-life character Joan Clarke. This is the third cinema release this year, in which this reviewer has seen Miss Knightley. Previously she played the wife of 'Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit' and later the talented Miss Knightley gave a delicate and exquisite performance in the musically-themed 'Begin Again'. Whilst that was good, her performance here in 'The Imitation Game' is arguably even better. Both Miss Knighley and Mr Cumberbatch play characters trapped by social-conventions. They convince us of the reality of their situation, and a great plot, and great writing, show us the impact, reality, and resolution, of those said situations.There is a good supporting cast, with strong performances from Charles Dance and Mark Strong. Matthew Goode, Rory Kinnear, and Allen Leech also gave good performances. It was good too, to see brief appearances by Steven Waddington, and Tuppence Middleton. It's always good to see Miss Middleton, as I have now, also for the third time this year. A brief appearance earlier in 'A Long Way Down', was followed by 'The Love Punch'. After her earlier lighter films, it is nice to see her get a small part in a serious film. Last, but by no means least, young Alex Lawther gives a performance that is truly outstanding. His role is an essential part of the film, and he plays his character so that it fits seamlessly into the rest of the film.My one gripe with this film, is it's non-chronological style. I am not a fan of this style, but although I can see why it was done, I still think it unnecessary. It delivers some exposition and a nice little understanding of an element of the story, but in reality, it is not essential. Chronology would still deliver the same impact. I assume the film-makers wished to concentrate on the life of Alan Turing rather than the Enigma story. The film title suggests this and refers partially to his AI test of computer v human.Alan Turing made an important contribution to science with his machines, one that is our legacy still in the computer-age present-day. There is now a museum, that is open to the public at Bletchley Park. The film glamourized the life led then. In reality, people worked long hours, girls collapsed from overwork, no talking was the rule.It is estimated that their work shortened the war by 2-4 years. War-time British Prime-Minister Winston Churchill said 'Ultra' was of the utmost importance in winning the war. The work started by Alan Turing eventually morphed from WWII Bletchley to GCHQ. Alan Turing was awarded an OBE in 1945 for his work. However his work remained secret. He wrote two papers; one on probability, the other on statistics of repetitions, both only released in 2012, they were that important, and thus that secret.This film does not require it's viewers to be scientists. The science part is easily explained and understood. What we have here is an exciting film about scientists going about their work. It was an exciting time. It was war-time. The logic of war is shown in the choices made and the decisions taken.'The Imitation Game' is rated in the UK as 12A for what are described as moderate sex-references. It is not a kids film. The subject-matter is serious. Whilst not an action film, this film does have scenes that show the reality of war.Many ordinary people made great sacrifices, and worked very hard in their roles during WWII. Brilliant minds, like those of Alan Turing, also fought the war in their own most effective way. It was a time summed up best by Winston Churchill, when he said on the 18th of June 1940 '... if the British Commonwealth and Empire lasts for a thousand years, men will say, 'This was their finest hour.'' This film tells the true story of John Turing, and other scientists. Their story was secret for many years. This great film salutes him, and them. As do we. 9/10.",Null,4,10,25 November 2014
Jurassic World," Silly scientist creates a Frankenstein's monster!
","A Universal film, the 3D version delights from the first appearance of the studio icon, right through to the end of the film.'Jurassic World' is a film about a dinosaur theme-park set on an island. The 'Jurassic Park' (1993), of two decades earlier, is hinted at in 'Jurassic World'.Film opens with an emotional and harassed mother played by Judy Greer. She is packing her boys off to go on holiday to the dinosaur theme-park. Miss Greer had a small part in the 2013 'Carrie' remake, though my favourite role of hers was in 'The Big Bang Theory' TV series.Nick Robinson (not the BBC Political Editor) plays well the role of the elder brother. He is a surly teenager, uninterested and unreliable. His younger brother is played to perfection by Ty Simpkins. He is in fact a show-business veteran who has been performing since he was a baby, and it shows! He plays a small boy, who like all small boys, has bags of energy, and this is shown well. There are also emotional scenes which are done very well. The two boys feature heavily in the film.The boys arrive at the island as the guests of their aunt (the sister of their mother). However, as she is the chief administrator on the island, and thus very busy, she places them in the care of a surly baby-sitter. Auntie Clare is played by Bryce Dallas Howard, daughter of Ron Howard. Her character is humourless and work-obsessed. She may not be the best auntie in the world, or the best boss, however her destiny is not that ridiculous dereliction of duty Dwayne Johnson acted out in the recent 'San Andreas'.It is when the boys arrive at the hotel that we see some great scenes. John Ford's 'The Searchers', has that iconic scene of John Wayne inside the door-frame, as the door shuts. Here we have the opposite, as the hotel window opens, and we fly out of the window, to take in the park scenery. What a shot! Jurassic World's Director is Colin Trevorrow. This is only the second film he has directed. The first, which I am very fond of, is a time-travel rom-com called 'Safety Not Guaranteed' (2012). It was written by Derek Connolly. The two also were producers. Here, they have collaborated with the screenplay. Also here from 'Safety,' is Jake Johnson, who is also familiar for his role in the 'New Girl' TV series. Here he plays a cynical and thoughtful technician.The film itself is also cynical. There are a couple of clumsy product-placements. However this is balanced by what can only be described as a not too subtle indictment of capitalism. The best since 'Nightcrawler' (2014). This is seen in many scenes, but 'ride-boy' encapsulates this perfectly.The theme-park wants to make money, thus to keep visitor numbers up, newer dinosaurs need to be introduced. Thus we have DB Wong, from 'Law & Order: Special Victims Unit' TV series, playing a scientist who is working on that. Earlier this year, Mr Wong played a manic gambler in the con-rom-com 'Focus'. Here he once again plays the role of a serious doctor.Another Law & Order veteran, is also one of my favourite actors, Vincent D'Onofrio. Knowledge of his appearance, was decisive in choosing to see this film. Unlike the small part he played in last year's 'The Judge', here he gets a bigger and more meaty role. His character has a military background. He is cold and ruthless, as well as very persuasive in his forward planning and thinking. Casting must be rated highly. I was particularly happy to see many of my acting favourites in this film.Chris Pratt plays an animal-behaviourist, who understands and empathises with the dinosaurs. This puts him into conflict with the others administering the park. Irrfan Khan, plays a boss, and Lauren Lapkus an underling. Both small parts are played well and believably.The 3D-effects and the special-effects are all done well, and are also enjoyably viewed. The dinosaur scenes are exciting and thrilling. There is a fight sequence reminiscent of 'King Kong'.Much of the film is shot from the POV of the two brothers, who feature heavily in this film, just as much as the adult stars, thus this film will appeal to boys. However UK rating is 12A. Parents should be aware that the eating habits of the dinosaurs may be upsetting for young children. Though boys aged 12+ will lap it up.This film is a concrete lesson on the dangers of putting the pound (£) before principles, or the dollar ($) for that matter too. Scientists play god at their peril, and ours too. As they reverse history and plunge us back into the Jurassic World, we can only once again shout out the old battle-cry of 70 million years ago; 'Death to the dinosaurs!, long live the mammals!' Film has a much better ending than 'San Andreas'.An enjoyable and exciting film. 10/10.",Null,51,119,15 June 2015
Everest," A small window to summit.
","As a small boy I remember seeing Spencer Tracy and Robert Wagner in the film 'The Mountain' (1956). Perhaps inspired, I enjoyed climbing trees and walls, and hanging off them, but not falling off them. I later graduated to do some hill-walking but nothing more adventurous than that. Thus, I have always had an interest in climbing films, but have avoided any recent films about chopping off ones own arm. My first thought about this new film 'Everest' was to avoid it as I had thought it set in 2014. However, the trailer looked exciting and good, and when I discovered that the film was not set in 2014, I decided to give it a go. The film is in fact set in 1996 and is a true story.Named after Sir George Everest, Mount Everest is the highest mountain in the world, at 8,844m or 29,017ft of rock, with varying levels of ice upon that. The peak is actually in the stratosphere, thus exposing it to the jet-stream, and air-pressure is a third that of sea-level thus reducing the availability of oxygen. Winds can also reduce the oxygen by a further 14%. Above 8,000m or 26,000ft, is known as the death zone. In that zone you are actually dying all the time, sometimes slowly, sometimes quickly. Most deaths occur after summiting. There are 150 dead bodies lying on the mountain.Thus climbing Everest is hard. Each Spring and Autumn there is a 7- 10 day window of lighter winds due to the start or end of the monsoon. Winter is cold and windy, and Autumn has the fresh snow from the Summer, thus Spring is the best time for climbing.'Everest', a Universal Pictures film, is set in the Spring of 1996, and tells the true story of rival adventure companies trying to summit Everest. Adventure Consultants was led by Rob Hall and Mountain Madness was led by Scott Fischer. Both guides ran commercial companies that organized fee-paying climbing trips for clients.Director Baltasar Kormakur had previously directed '2 Guns' a standard action-buddy-comedy film. Here though, he takes this true story and directs and shoots it magnificently. Some scenes were shot in Italy but others were shot in Nepal, including those shot at the South Base Camp of Everest. We see the clients arrive at the airport in Nepal, then travel from the hustle-and-bustle of the city up into the hills. An aerial shot up a valley gorge with bridges crossing it, is merely the first of many great shots. There were many others too. Watching the 3D version, you can see down crevasses, and round, and down, the sides of the mountains. The overall effect is of one huge landscape of rock carved by nature, and covered by rocks, snow, and ice.John Clarke, who earlier this year played the legendary John Connor in 'Terminator Genisys', here takes on the role of Rob Hall. Curiously in both films he was a replacement for Christian Bale. Christian's loss is John's gain, and ours too, as he convinces in his role as the mountain guide.Rival guide Scott Fischer is played by Jake Gyllenhaal, now highly regarded following such films as 'Source Code' (2011), 'End of Watch' (2012), and 'Nightcrawler' (2014). Here too, Jake makes his part a fully-rounded character.Ingvar Eggert Sigurdsson plays guide Anatoli Boukreev and Michael Kelly plays client Jon Krakauer. Of other clients; Josh Brolin, son of James Brolin, first caught my eye for his strong performance in 'American Gangster' of 2007, he also did 'No Country for Old Men' in that same year. Here Josh plays Beck Weathers, an outstanding performance, as too was that of John Hawkes playing Doug Hansen.Elizabeth Debicki, Emily Watson and Sam Worthington, play characters at base camp. Keira Knightley and Robin Wright play wives. Miss Wright is Peach Weathers and Miss Knightley plays Jan Arnold the wife of Rob Hall. Jan and Rob met and climbed a mountain for their first date, and in 1993, three years before this film was set, they had both summited Everest. Miss Knighley, who was recently in 'Begin Again' (2013), and in 2014 also appeared in 'Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit' and 'The Imitation Game', here in 'Everest', once more delivers a strong and emotional performance.The dangers faced by the climbers is best exemplified by a short night-scene at base-camp. There is a hedonistic party with much camaraderie. However the next day these same people could be walking past one another, one surviving, and one dying. This atmosphere of life on the edge is caught well in the film. As too, are the issues regarding commercialization, competition, and other controversial issues. For those interested in further examining these issues, there are three different books that have been written about this Everest story.An emotional rendering of a true story. 10/10.",Null,1,3,23 September 2015
Elysium," This thought-provoking action SF film is a metaphor.
","This futuristic film presents us with a dystopian vision of a future Earth which is overpopulated and polluted. There is however also a utopia, 'Elysium', which orbits Earth and is the home of a rich elite who have had it built and now have a carefree existence living there.Film opens with shots of a young boy who bears a remarkable resemblance to Matt Damon the star of this film. Earth has been in a bad state all of his life and his desire is to go to Elysium. People on earth do go to Elysium though. However they do this illegally. If they pay enough money to the people-smugglers they get taken on craft that fly illegally to the artificial world and sneak in.Trying to stop the illegal immigrants and deal with other security matters, are the security personnel. They are human and robotic, and are based, and act, on both Earth and Elysium.Matt Damon plays the part of a simple worker, luckier than most of his unemployed fellow neighbours living in the slum, an ex-criminal who has now turned his back on crime. However his life and work are both hard and dangerous. Life on Earth is cheap, and unlike on Elysium, by contrast the medical services are poor.Worker Damon suffers an industrial injury that requires treatment and is the plot device that requires him to travel to Elysium. There is a plan to get him there but things don't work out as planned.In some ways this film reminded this reviewer of 'Demolition Man'. In this futuristic film, just like 'DM', the people are politely nasty. They are abrupt, rude and very plain-speaking, but all this is done in a very polite way of speaking. Some of the time anyway.Casting has been done in such a way as to emphasize the points that the story is trying to make. The people of Earth inhabit slums and shanty-towns. They look like poor immigrants and peasants anywhere. By contrast up in Elysium the people look and sound very different. Accents and language also play a part in illustrating this.Earth is crime-ridden and covered in graffiti, whilst Elysium is a peaceful haven. So for Elysium to be protected from the violent gun-wielding people of Earth, Elysium must also use some violence for protection. This requires not just robots, but also human security and military personnel. These military operatives, and their world, and outlook, are portrayed well, and stereotypical casting and accent choices make their attitudes and role unambiguous to the viewer. They also function in this film to pose the question to the viewer of the role of the military in society.Star Matt Damon gives a great performance in his role as a simple worker. However some of the decisions of our simple worker do not impress. His judgements are a little too simple and he makes some bad decisions. Damon is well supported by a good cast. The great Jodie Foster has second billing, however her character is strange and even stranger is how the film-makers have used Miss Foster. A powerful performance came from Sharlto Copley who dominated in every scene he was in. This reviewer was happy too, to see William Fichtner, a well-recognized face, that this reviewer last saw giving a tremendous performance in 'Heat'.With all the robots, this film reminded this reviewer of 'Oblivion' from earlier this year. There was a similar theme of a dirty Earth below and a shiny top-world. However this film is somewhat less unoriginal. Some scenes also reminded this reviewer of 'Star Trek Into Darkness' another film from earlier this year. However unlike that film this seemed less of just a collection of action scenes, though dumb decisions by characters did cause some of that.The film set up the hero to have some serious fights with a seriously bad guy. Just like 'Demolition Man', sadly however, some fight scenes were filmed in such a way that it was difficult to even see what was happening, they were that fast. Special effects concerning the gadgets were all uniformly good. The high-tech gear, the low-tech salvaged gear, the flying machines; all were totally believable throughout the film. One item that jarred was the total absence of background music. Instead we were attacked by very loud music that was far too intrusive. On the other hand, all scenes, sets and locations were good, particularly of the grim cities of Earth.Better than the comparable 'Oblivion', it is on a par with 'Star Trek Into Darkness' and 'World War Z'. Rather like 'WWZ', the narrative of this film gives us comparisons with present day Earth and it's problems, and poses the question at what cost can you build a utopia, when is the cost too high, and how do you balance the rights and duties of the people within the utopia, with the rights and duties to those who are outside of it? 8/10.",Null,3,6,27 August 2013
Sicario," A boring, clichéd, dull, pointless and silly story about the drugs war.
","An FBI Agent played by British actress Emily Blunt takes part in a raid that exposes drug-cartel activity. She then volunteers to join a joint task-force planning to disrupt the cartel by 'shaking the tree'. Other members of the task-force include Josh Brolin and Benicio Del Toro.The trailer for the film looked promising, and the trailer is an accurate representation of the early scenes in the film. However, this action film is unbelievable as an accurate portrayal of the 'war on drugs'. Having said that, when assessing how the 'war on terror' was conducted, perhaps the film scenario cannot be completely ruled out. This would certainly have been a more accurate film if the cartel and the drugs were not in the film and it had just been a straight war film based on the 'war on terror'. If this is a true representation of the 'war on drugs', it is clear why that war is being lost. Those fighting the 'war on drugs', in this film, are plain stupid. The 'shaking of the tree' tactic, adopted at the start of the film, is bad enough. However, when the 'grand strategy' is finally revealed, it is laughable in it's simplicity and stupidity.The film itself consists of a number of scenes, each of which, whilst engaging enough in themselves, do not logically link up in any real way. The original scene is merely a McGuffin that is used to get the characters together and bears no relation to the following scene which is in the trailer. Then there is the bus scene, which again seems to have no connection with anything else. The bar-scene is unnecessary and the following scene is unbelievable. Most of the following scenes also seem unbelievable too.One saving grace for this film is that while this year's (2015) recent 'Solace' was a good story that was very badly filmed. 'Sicario' is a bad story, that at least is very well filmed. There is an authentically filmed night scene, however I have to admit that I just found it boring. On the other hand, one standout scene is the aerial film- shoot of the border. This was clearly a labour of love for Cinematographer Roger Deakins and interestingly shows that 'Donald Trump's Wall' is already partially built. There are also many vivid scenes of majestic mountains and run-down towns.The actors do their best. Miss Blunt acts her part well, showing much believable emotion. However, sadly her character is not believable. Her joining the task-force and going on the first mission is not believable. It takes her character an hour to realize what I realized at the start of this film. The film is shot from her POV, but the plot is so obvious that there are few, if any, surprises.Benicio Del Toro is a quiet brooding presence. Apparently, he requested, and got, a lot of his dialogue deleted. Good job too. Sadly though, again we have a completely unbelievable character. His back-story is meant to explain how he got to where he is. It merely contradicts. His actions in this film totally contradict the back- story. I was always expecting so much more from his character, but I got zilch. Nothing. There was just nothing to his character. However, when Mr Del Toro has some decent material to work with, he can give a very fine performance, such as his so well-rounded character in the drama 'Things We Lost in the Fire' (2007).2007 is also the year that Josh Brolin appeared in two drug-themed films, 'No Country for Old Men' and 'American Gangster' so this is familiar territory for Mr Brolin. In 'American Gangster', Josh played an abrasive cop with an easily discernible character. Here though, in 'Sicario' his character is much more laid-back and subdued, reminding me of John Malkovitch in 'Ripley's Game' (2002). Josh Brolin's career can be said to have peaked, and he reached the summit, in his fine performance in the recent 'Everest' (2015).British actor Daniel Kaluuya plays well his small part as an FBI Agent. However, Maximiliano Hernandez and Kim Larricho played two minor characters that we saw far too little of. What little they did, they did well. However, I am left thinking how much better this film would have been if their character-roles were much more central to the plot.Director Denis Villeneuve and Writer Taylor Sheridan have delivered up an unbelievable film and story. If it were true to life it would be a massive indictment of the 'war on drugs'. However, it is rather a massive indictment of poor and unbelievable story-telling. Action after action, and scene after scene, are just not believable. These things just would not happen. As improbability piles on top of improbability, perhaps people should just accept this as a silly action film.To see a much better film about drug-cartels, with real rounded three-dimensional characters, go and get a DVD of Arnold Schwarzenegger in 'Collateral Damage' (2002), or the more recent 'End of Watch' (2012) starring Jake Gyllenhaal and Michael Pina.I thought 'Sicario' might have been a decent action film. Sadly, it just turned out to be unbelievable rubbish. Avoid! 5/10.",Null,2,11,12 October 2015
The Big Short," A derivative film about breaking the bank, also breaks the fourth wall too!
","This Paramount film tells the story of how the sub-prime crisis lead to a banking crisis and collapse in 2008, followed by a world-wide recession. As the trailers show, the tale is told by following a few odd-ball characters connected to the financial markets, who do not accept the orthodox perceived wisdom.The story starts with Michael Burry a physically and socially handicapped fund manager who obsessively investigates the figures and numbers in the property market. We viewers are given explanations, via the fourth wall, that help us to understand the subject, whilst also being entertaining. We discover bankers have bundled up mortgages, called securitization, and then sold them, the derivatives, as assets. However these are bundled, and re-bundled, and include mortgages known as sub-prime. These assets were sold as AAA (triple A) but in reality were not. The sub-prime tranches (parts) diluted the AAA tranches. Michael Burry realizes this and invests (basically by betting against this) to earn money if there is a default. Others also discover this and also invest likewise.Michael Burry, the odd-ball financial-whiz is played by Christian Bale. His character is not a normal Wall Street guy, physical deformity has made him socially awkward, so he spends all of his time in his office, crunching numbers, as he listens to loud rock music. Sadly, the loud music, we also get some unnecessary rap music later too, detracts from the enjoyment of the film.Another flaw of this film, and it is a massive one, is the appalling camera work. The use of the fourth wall, so characters can give viewers explanations, is essential for this film, and was done very well. No criticism of that. Or for some real-life stock-footage. It is everything else that is dire. The camera swoops and swings wildly and out of focus. The filming is at times very poor, often fairly poor, and thus this also makes for some very uncomfortable viewing. This film is interesting because of it's subject matter, but not for film quality. To see great filming, go and see 'The Revenant', also out in 2016. the comparison between the two films is night and day. Christian Bale is very good in his role, losing himself in it, as he did in 'The Prestige' (2006), and also in 'American Hustle' (2013) in which he was unrecognizable. In the recent 'Black Mass' (2015) gangster film, Johnny Depp used fake contact lenses to portray Whitey Bulger's piercing light blue eyes. Christian Bale is not made up to show his physical handicap, which is a shame, as it thus makes less of it to us viewers. Certainly a rich fund manager could pay for top quality, and no doubt he did, but for us to see, and feel, his pain, a more physically obvious handicap would have been better. This is not to slight Christian Bale who acts well to show his physical handicap, and his resultant Dr Sheldon Cooper-like social awkwardness.Steve Carell, who was excellent in 'Seeking a Friend for the End of the World' (2012), here plays another uptight banking figure who also becomes aware of the financial situation. In this film, Steve Carell actually has a much bigger role than Christian Bale. It is Mark Baum, played by Steve Carell, and his firm, who take us on the field-trips to Florida and Las Vegas, standout scenes btw, where we see the reality of the situation. Marisa Tomei, in a small role, plays well the part of the wife Cynthia Baum. Miss Tomei, so very recently in 'Christmas with the Coopers' (2015), here in a very different role, does some very moving scenes with Mr Carell.Ryan Gosling, previously in 'The Place Beyond the Pines' (2012), plays Jared Vennett, who is also in banking. Although not the biggest of parts, his character is also one of the main players in the story, and it is through him that we are also told the story.Brad Pitt too, has a small, but decent role, in this film. He is also a Producer too through his Plan B Entertainment. John Magaro and Finn Wittrock, in minor roles, play small-time fund-managers also involved in the story. Byron Mann shines in his one scene, as do Max Greenfield from 'New Girl' and Al Sapienza (Mikey Palmice from The Sopranos) in theirs.This film tells a true and sorry story. Banks over-lent and over- borrowed, then they churned their assets. When the sub-prime market collapsed because of fraudulent over-lending, the contagion spread around the world. Sadly, there is no mention of the contribution President Bill Clinton and President George Bush made towards this.Viewers should not be deterred from viewing by lack of financial knowledge. The film does it's best to explain matters in as simple a way as possible. This it does well, sometimes with some very visual examples. Thus we can grasp the general ideas fairly well and so understand the financial crash of 2008, the effects of which we are still feeling today. So this educational film is well worth seeing. It does have some humour too. Those who like comedy, and also desire a primer on the capitalist system, should dig out an old DVD of the classic 'Trading Places' (1983) which gives some explanation as to how markets trade in concentrated orange juice and pork bellies. Others may also enjoy the more recent 'Margin Call' (2011), which is a serious film that also deals with the same 2008 bank crash. 8/10.",Null,0,1,25 January 2016
Lucy," OTT SF film is also a bloody crime story.
","A Universal film. Exciting trailers suggested a film rather like 'Transcendence' from earlier this year starring Johnny Depp, and so it turned out to be. 'Her' (2013), which was screened earlier this year, starred Joaquin Phoenix as a man who fell in love with his computer. That film concentrated on the personal and was rather boring. By contrast, in 'Transcendence', Johnny Depp is plugged into a computer, an event which is exciting and has far-reaching consequences.In 2011, Bradley Cooper starred in 'Limitless' playing a man who takes a drug which expands his brain-power. 'Lucy' has a similar plot, so it is not an original idea. However it is an exciting film. If however you are interested in this brain-expanding idea, 'Limitless' is the better of the two films. Like in 'Her', 'Limitless' concentrated on the personal, and was rather believable. Writer and director Luc Besson seems to have taken that idea as a starting point, but then via a crime story, has moved into a 'Transcendence' mode of limitless possibilities.In 1994 Luc Besson astonished audiences with his 'Leon'. Now in 'Lucy' Mr Besson has given us a rather similar bloody and exciting crime story.'Lucy' opens with some nice graphics to go with the opening titles. However, just like in 'Leon', it is merely the calm before the storm. Some information given out about this film was that the star, Scarlett Johansson, played a character forced to carry drugs, which then got into her system. This seemed an unlikely scenario but Luc Besson makes it a believable situation.Miss Johansson plays a not too bright party girl in Taiwan who is caught up in the clutches of a gang of violent criminals. Just as 'Leon' opens with a young Natalie Portman scared of falling into the clutches of mad killer Gary Oldman, so in 'Lucy' we have a similar scenario. Miss Johansson stumbles into the clutches of a Mr Jang played by Min-sik Choi. This villainous character makes Mr Oldman look like a pussy-cat. Like Miss Portman before her, Miss Johansson attempts to escape her predicament. However she is unable to. The situation gets worse and worse, the scenes bloodier and bloodier, unremittingly so.Whilst the early scenes are filmed in Taiwan and are clearly based in Taiwan, the gangsters do not seem to be Triad members. The body-tattooing and Korean language suggest rather that these gangsters are in fact the Japanese Yakuza, who in reality have many ethnic Korean members. Poor little white girl Lucy, unable to speak the language, is terrified by the situation. This is captured well, and we, like Lucy, do not understand the situation. In these scenes Miss Johansson is very emotional and gives a superb performance. As the film develops, so does Lucy, and she becomes more like 'the woman who knows too much', acting accordingly, and again Miss Johansson excels in this character development.Morgan Freeman and Amr Waked give good support, but this film is all about Scarlett Johansson and Min-sik Choi, who are the chief protagonists, and who dominate the proceedings, in every scene they are in. Two tremendous performances.This film is part SF, and part crime story. It is very bloody. If you liked 'Leon' (1994), or 'Transcendence' (2014), then you should enjoy this film. Fans of SF and pseudo-science will enjoy this film, but it is not suitable for viewing by scientists.Bloody, but good. 9/10.",Null,5,13,1 September 2014
Flight," 'He was some kind of a man'.
","Paramount picture, so we see that lovely mountain.Lead male is played by Denzel Washington. As film opens we see him waking for an early morning flight. The opening scene sets the scene for what is about to unfold, and so is not to be missed. Film moves quickly on to the flight, which encounters difficulties, to be blunt the plane nose-dives. The plane is going down (even while some stragglers are still coming into the cinema!).Plane crash is done well by film and pilot. This is no rugby team crashing into the Andes Mountains. It is as dramatic, though the forced landing is not as destructive. Main theme of the film is how the crash effects Denzel Washington. In an interview, Washington says the film had nothing to do with the story of the plane that landed in the Hudson River, rather the story is about ten years old, and is based on a real-life event, thus the engineering and flying aspects are technically correct and actors used a simulator in preparation for the role.Washington is a man with a good heart, but not a stout one, instead he is rather weak-hearted. After the crash, he meets others who have some effect on him. Washington is very believable as he deals with the emotions and situations that beset him. Nothing else however is to be expected from this great actor. Those who have seen him as the senior policeman in 'Training Day' or playing the gangster Frank Lucas, know he gives great performances of real depth, showing real human emotion, showing the bad in the good, and the good in the bad.Some humour is injected with the appearance of John Goodman. Goodman who showed much pathos as Babe Ruth, who graced TV screens as the stage husband of 'Rosanne', is now gracing the screen with lovely cameo roles. However those who loved him in 'Argo' may have difficulty in spotting him. Not since Sean Penn was lawyer Dave, to his client Al Pacino, in 'Carlito's Way', have we seen such a transformation. It is as if that Argo film producer had been doing his own make-up for this film. Goodman is in only briefly but plays to the hilt his larger-than-life character. Supporting cast give good performances, but a special mention should go to a stalwart from the 'Law & Order SVU' TV series, who gives a very strong performance. There again, you don't spend years on a TV series without learning how to act.In the main thread of the story, and the other threads, this film deals with adult themes. In the UK, it is rated 15. These adult themes are not hidden, and are central to the plot.This film surpassed my expectations, and finding no fault with it, I must give it a 10/10.",Null,3,6,5 February 2013
Spectre," Boring story about Bond, James Bond, looking for people, finding them, going into buildings, coming out of them.
","Previous Bond films have been recently screened on British TV, no doubt to coincide with the cinema release of the latest Bond film; 'Spectre'. So it is then that this reviewer has once again recently seen 'Quantum of Solace' (2008), and 'Skyfall' (2012).'Quantum' had Mathieu Amalric playing a bad guy controlling a powerful organization, which amongst other things, had seized control of all of the water in a desert. The film was classic Bond, Mathieu himself was very good in his role. As he was in the Hitchcockian-like 'Love is the Perfect Crime' 2013.'Skyfall' also had a powerful organization, this time headed-up by Javier Bardem. However, this organization was merely used by the camp rogue-agent Bardem, with his Mummy-issues, as his own private vehicle to exact his revenge. It had an excellent opening song by Adele, an interesting 'first-time' confrontation, and also some interesting origin back-stories. Despite this however, there was a distasteful 'spilt whisky' scene, that was alien to the Bond universe, and the recent TV showing, made me notice, what I had not picked up at the cinema showing; namely that the analysis of the Moneypenny bullet seemed illogical.Thus fully prepped in the Bond universe, this reviewer was looking forward to a cinema visit to see the latest recorded exploits of Agent Bond, James Bond, in the newly released 'Spectre'.The film is rated 12A in the UK, thus is suitable viewing for teenagers and older persons. It opens with the familiar MGM and Columbia icons but they are somewhat dark, perhaps to suggest the dark plot that will unfold. Most of the film is actually shot in a golden hue that no doubt is meant to suggest a classic Bond-era look and theme. Which it does, though for me that hue was just a spot too golden at times.After the studio icons the film opens proper with a scene set in Mexico. Trailers have shown parts of this scene but they are not able to show the full majesty of the scene. It is set in Mexico, as it celebrates 'The Day of the Dead'. However it is not the colour or the garishness that catch the eye but rather the opening tracking-shot itself. Noticing it may take you out of the picture a bit, but it is perhaps one of the most impressive tracking shots ever filmed and you can only gawp at it in all it's majesty. It is a bravura piece of work by Director Sam Ramis, (who previously directed 'Skyfall'), comparable to the very best by Alfred Hitchcock or Martin Scorsese.As the trailers show, Agent Bond claims that he was on holiday but it seems that rather he has gone rogue. He then proceeds through the rest of the film looking for people and finding them, going into buildings and then coming out of them. He travels the world doing this and much of the filming of this is very good. London and Rome in particular are two cities where many great iconic scenes and key locations are shown. The overall effect being of watching a glossy travel ad. Then there are the buildings. There seems to be almost a fetish about the buildings in the film. Buildings are approached, we seem them in all of their grandeur, they are entered, and we have a scene with tension building. However these scenes just go on far too long, there is no real tension, after which the building is easily and quickly exited. The entire film seems little more than a collection of set-pieces of entering buildings that are stunning for various reasons. Why Bond looks for someone is never logically explained. How this leads to the next scene is also tenuous too. The action of James Bond's fellow agency members is not believable, realistic, or make sense. This also applies to members of other agencies, as well as to the members of the evil organization too.Why Bond should look for these people he searches for, and why others should care if he finds them, is just unbelievable nonsense. This just went on and on, and was incomprehensible. After about a good half of this film, a couple of people walked out. I cannot blame them. This was such a stupidly written plot. There were some interesting plot twists but most could have been predicted before they happened. The chase scenes were rather unrealistic and as there was no real sense of a threat of danger, they were thus unexciting and uninteresting. By contrast, the fight scenes were brutal and good. There was a little humour, but like the action and the plot, these all seemed a little forced as if they were trying too hard, thus the overall effect was a little silly.Of the actors, Daniel Craig was excellent as Bond. This Bond is now experienced and mature, with a hint of greying hair. He is also a spot cynical. It was a fine performance. Rory Kinnear, son of Roy, continues in the role he previously played in 'Quantum' and 'Skyfall'. Ralph Feinnes, Naomie Harris and Ben Whishaw also return to their 'Skyfall' roles. Andrew Scott is good in his role too. We get a very solid performance from Dave Bautista, and also from Lea Seydoux too.The trailer for 'Spectre' suggested a spot too much action for my taste, in reality some of the talky scenes reminded me of 'Wacky Races' and 'Sons and Daughters', ( I will leave you dear reader, to try to spot which ones those were), and aching for more action instead of all of the exposition. The film opened and closed well, those scenes could not be bettered and as such are a fine tribute to all involved. However, sadly, most of the central core of the film was illogical and unbelievable, and confusing, thus frankly, ending up as boring. OK. 5/10.",Null,6,24,28 October 2015
Joy," Silver Linings II: First time was a dance ... this time they wipe the floor!
","The team that brought us the 'Silver Linings Playbook' (2012) and 'American Hustle' (2013), have once again given us a solid film. This time they tell the true story of Joy Mangano, the inventor of the Miracle Mop, and her Italian-American family.The film opens with the traditional icon and music of the '20th Century Fox' studio, but that is cut short as we embark on a weird and whimsical start to the film. The bizarre opening is a spot slow and at first appears irrelevant. We soon come to realize the significance of the opening.Jennifer Lawrence plays the eponymous Joy. She lives in what seems a big house with her big family. These early family scenes show a modern, but chaotic, family. This reviewer found these scenes to be some of the most authentic filmed. I saw those scenes in the film, and I have seen almost exactly the same ones in real-life too. The real-life Joy Mangano is an executive producer of this film, thus we should conclude that the early part of the film, as well as the rest of the film, is sufficiently close enough to the truth for her satisfaction.Joy was encouraged from her youngest days, but in her adult life, the early promise seemed to fail to materialize. Adult Joy seemed to be leading a hum-drum ordinary existence. Miss Lawrence, who previously, in 'American Hustle', played the dumb-blond bravely tackling the 'science-oven', here plays a sharp-minded innovator. Following a spillage, she has an epiphany, and invents the 'Miracle Mop'. Incidentally, it must be said what a pleasure it was, to see an actress wearing such authentically-looking soiled-clothing as Miss Lawrence does throughout this film. A good eye for detail was displayed there as well as in other parts of the film. Period-detail was good, both in the scenes, and as the characters aged. Family home-movies, and the TV, also gave authenticity. As did the well chosen music.David O. Russell who previously brought us Silver Linings and American Hustle, once again brings together Jennifer Lawrence, Robert De Niro and Bradley Cooper as cast, as he directs, writes, and produces, 'Joy'. We have to assume that they are all happy working together as a team. They certainly work well together. There is a natural authenticity and believability about their performances. They are joined by a good supporting cast. For me, a stand-out supporting actor, was Edgar Ramirez. Miss Lawrence has to develop a many-sided complex character. But this is also somewhat true for Mr Ramirez too. He too has different sides to his character, which are pleasantly revealed throughout the film. Finally, young Isabella Crovetti-Cramp was perfect in her small part.This film is not a drama about a couple of mentally-disturbed people just having a dance. This real-life story is a much more complex affair. It is a drama, with some humour and romance. There are interesting scenes as Joy first gives birth to her idea, then tries to develop it, and then make it a reality. The scenes where the idea is pitched, then the studio scenes, are nail-biting and poignant. Incidentally, the 20th Century Fox studio has it's very own small part to play in the story. The cut-throat business world is also shown well. As are the romantic scenes. Whilst not central to the story, the romance and family scenes, are rich and authentic, and round out the characters.Despite a start and finish that were both a spot slow, 'Joy' is an excellent and solid film from the team that gave us the 'Silver Linings Playbook' and 'American Hustle'. Miss Lawrence is a joy as 'Joy', as is the film itself. For we audience members, the silver lining is that there is still much joy to come from this play-book. 8/10.",Null,5,15,5 January 2016
Her," A lonely man falls in love with his computer.
","Film opens with lead actor Joaquin Phoenix at his work-desk. He spends his day oozing fake sentimentality, as he helps other people to connect with one another. However in reality, he and many others, live fundamentally lonely lives in this near-future dystopia.He lives in a city with shiny sky-scrapers. His life is good. This future world seems to have no problems, no shortages, no wants. However this brave new world is dominated by communication devices and gadgets. It is really very much like our own world, but the computers are just much more advanced.Decades ago now, SF writer Isaac Asimov introduced us to his 'Three Laws of Robotics' and SF writer Douglas Adams introduced us to 'Computers with the new GPP feature', (Genuine People Personalities). So this modern film is perhaps exploring some now old ideas. However this is a serious film that is clearly looking at the trends in our modern world and looking at where they may take us. As such this is a good film.Last year, around St Valentine's Day, this reviewer saw the heart-warming zombie-romance film 'Warm Bodies'. However I felt that 'Her', about a man in love with a computer, seemed to lack something, and so very nearly decided not to watch it.This film is about a computer, or to be more precise an 'OS' ('Operating System') that handles emails as well as a host of other activities, that has some sort of artificial intelligence. It is the latest must-have gadget. Mr Phoenix, plays Theodore, who decides to have this. Now 'AI' (Artificial Intelligence), in our real world, is the holy grail, which at this very moment in time is having huge amounts of money invested in it. So this film is actually very prescient.When Theodore gets his 'OS' he falls in love with it. The 'OS' system, Samantha, is played by Scarlett Johansson, who was in the 2009 film 'He's Just Not That Into You'. Both Miss Johansson and Mr Phoenix play their parts well and convince us in their relationship as they fall in love. However as this film is about a man in love with a computer, it begs the question, where is this relationship going? The relationship does in fact go very well, and functions like all other relationships. Clearly we are meant to pick up that the relationship with Samantha, the 'OS', is just like any other relationship between humans. We see it start and grow and develop.Theodore is a lonely man. He was married, but his wife, played by Rooney Mara, is divorcing him. He meets a woman, played by Olivia Wilde, but he cannot commit. Both actresses give good and believable performances in their supporting roles. Another good supporting performance is given by Amy Adams, who recently wowed us with her great performance in the recent Oscar-nominated 'American Hustle'. One other actress deserves a special mention, because Portia Doubleday, although in a very small part, plays a character very different from her 'mean girl' Chris Hargensen in the 2013 remake of 'Carrie'. She is clearly an accomplished actress.Spike Jonze is both the writer and director of this film. Script is good and believable, film locations are well chosen (very futuristic), and the shooting of the film itself was expertly done. Mr Jonze was the director of the 1999 film 'Being John Malkovitch'. He is clearly a clever writer and director who enjoys making clever films. In this film, 'Her', he even finds time to contribute a voice to a small computer part. And yes, that other, (all too brief), rich voice, you hear, is that of Brian Cox.Mr Phoenix too, is someone who likes to do serious films. 'The Master' (2012) is a similarly serious film, and Mr Phoenix clearly enjoys playing those more complex characters. However, good and worthy as these films are, this reviewer found both that film, and this one, rather unsatisfying and joyless.The film then, is a worthy project, as it highlights current trends, and takes them to their logical conclusions. We are spending more and more of our time with things, and less and less of our time with people. Let's learn the lesson and reject the machines and loneliness, and reach out and embrace the people. Human contact and friendship is all.Those looking for an uplifting love and romance film, should try the unique 'A New York Winter's Tale'. Those who see this serious film, who are interested in the questions raised, should also try reading the thoughtful SF writing of Isaac Asimov. His machines are a million miles away from those of the 1984 film 'The Terminator'.To sum up then, as expected, this film does lack something, so is dull, but as a warning to humanity, it is a worthy project.Dull, but worthy. A serious film and a warning. 9/10.",Null,1,3,5 March 2014
Macbeth," 'Power tends to corrupt and absolute power corrupts absolutely' (Lord Acton), in Shakespeare's Scottish play of assassination, set in scenes of blood and mud.
","Elizabethan play-write William Shakespeare staged plays of great historical events. Necessarily limited by the stage-setting, these were the masterpieces of carefully crafted words and speeches that we now consider as Shakespearian English. Thus this reviewer considered the film version of Shakespeare's Scottish play as perhaps being too wordy and stagey to go and see. However, I was beguiled by the trailer, that seemed to suggest lots of action and battles. Alas, this was not to be. However, this dull, but worthy product, is a fine showcase for Shakespeare, Scotland, and the performing thespians of the film.This Scottish-themed film does open up on the battlefield. There are some interesting scenes as the warriors prepare for battle and the battle itself is shown well. (A later battle also has some interesting two-sworded battle scenes). During the battle, witches appear, and make a prophecy about the King of Scotland. The film tells the story of an attempt to fulfil the prophecy and of the aftermath of that attempt.The male lead is played by Michael Fassbender and the female lead playing opposite him is Marion Cottilard. They are superb in their roles and must have actually suffered hard for their craft. Location shooting for the film was in the Isle of Skye in Scotland. This reviewer has paddled in water there, and can assure readers that even in the height of summer, it is like putting your feet into buckets of ice. Yet, we have Mr Fassbender in water in a scene, and Miss Cottilard, far from her native France, is seen scampering about barefoot and lightly dressed. Bravo! it should be said that there is little sight of the summer in this story. There are many, many, scenes of bleak mountains and bogs and moorland. The climate is cold and wet, with swirling fogs often covering the rough terrain. The scenes are in fact very bleak and compare with those in the Viking film 'Valhalla Rising' (2009).Elizabeth Debicki, who also appeared in this year of 2015 in 'Everest', here does a standout scene, as relevant to us now as it was in the era it was set in. Sean Harris, who like Michael Fassbender, also appeared in Prometheus (2012), here delivers a brilliant and powerful performance. There is a scene in the 1995 Scottish film 'Braveheart' where William Wallace is floored in shock when he encounters the English champion. Here, in this film, Sean Harris, similarly has his emotions plunged to the depths, more than once. His acting is superb throughout the film.David Thewlis seems to have an ability to really inhabit his roles. The source material, (book), for the film 'Seven Years in Tibet' (1997) seems to show he got the part just right. So too, for his OTT role in the 2010 film 'Mr Nice' which again matched the source material in the book of the same name. In this year of 2015 though, his performances have seemed more subdued but still true to the source material. I found his portrayal in 'Legend' to be fascinating. Here, in this film, he takes a part and makes it very believable. The part he plays is very like one today and he seems to play it like that too. There are some obvious differences too in that role of course, but that is the essence of the plot of this Scottish film. We also get good supporting roles from Paddy Considine, David Hayman and Jack Reynor.Much of the location shooting is on the Isle of Skye in Scotland, though I did spot Bamburgh Castle too. Ely Cathedral is also featured. The cathedral scenes are spectacular as are the castle interiors, however the bulk of the film is shot in realistically grim surroundings. Our thespians spend most of their time wallowing in blood and mud, and the climate and terrain are both as gloomy and grim as the storyline. The use of hand-held cameras does detract though. As do some of the special-effects that take us out of the moment.This film is a good introduction to Shakespeare and his Scottish play. Political students can learn lessons from this story today, just as they can from 'I Claudius'. For those interested in the subjects of assassination, conspiracy, politics and statecraft, then the writings of the Renaissance Florentine statesman and writer Niccolo Machiavelli may also be of interest.This film of the Scottish play serves as a good way to engage a modern audience and as such has been a worthwhile project. 9/10.",Null,39,66,10 October 2015
Warm Bodies," Zombie film is no horror but rather a labour of love.
","Entering the new post-'Twilight' era, a few teen-romance-type films have been showing around St Valentine's Day. 'Beautiful Creatures' is one, 'Warm Bodies' is another. Both films are essentially love stories and both have the same plot. Whilst 'BC' competes with 'Twilight' on a 'I Married A Witch' type of plot, 'WB' has a zombie theme. However it should be clearly stated that this is a teen-romance love-story not a zombie film. The zombie theme is there and provides the backdrop to the story. All the basic plot-lines of zombie films are there, but are cleverly subverted in this rom-com film.Like 'BC' this film opens with a narration by the male lead. In 'WB', Nicholas Hoult, a tall thin lad, plays the male lead. As the credits roll, he explains that he is a zombie in a zombie-inhabited post-apocalypse world. This world is seen through his eyes throughout the film. This is his film and his world. At the start of the film the zombies appear rather like many stoned teenagers; they slouch about a lot, they wander aimlessly about with hunched shoulders.By a quirk of fate, male lead encounters female lead played by Teresa Palmer. Fate throws them together as it did Richard Hanney and the girl in 'The Thirty-Nine Steps'. Not handcuffed in the Highlands, but brought together, and hiding together, in this dangerous post-apocalyptic zombie-infested urban world. The result is the same. Male lead however, is a gawky youth, who struggles to impress the more vivacious girl. These scenes are played very naturally, the two leads play their roles well and convince in the reality of their relationship and the reality of their situation.The situation that is their reality, is the old story of love across the tracks. It becomes clear that this is a modern reworking of an old love story. It is blatantly so and the film revels in it. The standard themes are there, circumstances seem to prevent a relationship, their worlds are so different and the gulf between them too big. Like 'BC' we have the complication of family. We just know that the girl's father is not going to be accepting of this relationship.The stern father is played well by John Malkovich. Two other supporting parts are also well played. Analeigh Tipton gives a very believable performance as the girl's best friend. Rob Corddry, who this reviewer last saw sitting in a hot tub and a time machine in 'Hot Tub Time Machine', a surprisingly good and thoughtful film, in which RC gave a performance of some depth, in this film, he RC, plays the best friend of the gawky youth. Despite the subject matter of the film, here again, RC, gives a performance of depth that convinces in his role.Watch out for some scenes that are truly well filmed. The post-apocalypse suburbia is most impressive as are some of the swooping panoramic camera shots. No less impressive are the country scenes, the dream scenes and the gritty city scenes. Rated 12A in the UK, the film, whilst not gore-filled, is surprisingly grim. Dining-out is of course part of the film, and the zombie chase scenes are quite scary. The trailer for this film showed zombie fight scenes, and this reviewer was not impressed with those or looking forward to them. However, in the film itself, the fight scenes were done well and fitted well. Having said all that however, this film is a rom-com, and as such is entertaining and quietly funny.In boy-meets-girl romance stories it is very difficult to make a film that entertains, holds the tension, keeps you wondering if the romantic interest can grow into love, and how it will end, all the while maintaining, and not breaking, genre rules. This film does all that perfectly, from the very start to the very end.'WB', like 'BC', is a perfect date-movie for all young lovers, it did, in fact, surpass my expectations and therefore I have no hesitation in awarding it 10/10.",Null,5,7,26 February 2013
The Martian," Houston has a very big problem in this exciting and tense SF film.
","This Twentieth Century Fox film opens on the planet Mars. A crew is working there but they have to leave in a hurry and thus accidentally leave behind one of the crew, the eponymous 'Martian' played by Matt Damon.A major storm forced the rapid departure but Matt Damon's astronaut suffers an accident and his life-support systems show he is dead, thus the reason he is left behind. If he were dead, this would be a very short film. However, the film, 'The Martian', is 141 minutes long, (2hrs and 21mins), and as the trailers show, Astronaut Damon is alive and thus destined to be 'The Martian'. Alive, through a quirk of fate, Astronaut Damon realizes that he will soon die from starvation except if he can utilize fully his botany skills and Earth mounts a rescue mission.On Earth, Astronaut Damon is declared a hero, and a funeral is held. Things though quickly change when a lowly tech worker, played by Mackenzie Davis, discovers the reality. The scenes with Miss Davis on the floor of Mission Control are well done. The excellent Chiwetel Ejiofor is brought in as the story develops, as are Jeff Daniels, playing NASA head Teddy Sanders, and Sean Bean. Donald Glover too, gives an authentic performance as a bright computer geek and mathematician.Jeff Daniels has the hard role of playing the boss who has to play politics, play the long game, all the while playing the numbers, and most importantly playing safety first always. He does this well enough to arouse empathy and understanding in his position. Sean Bean's character is perhaps easier to play. He is compassionate, honourable and noble. The two instruct a rescue-mission. Benedict Wong plays well the engineer asked to meet impossible 'Scotty-style' deadlines. There is a little humour here in this, as there is in much of the rest of the film too.Unaware of any of this, are the crew of the Martian expedition, who are now sailing home back to Earth. Aksel Hennie, Kate Mara and Sebastian Stan are good in their roles as crew members. The pilot who had to blast off from Mars is played with great humanity by Michael Pina. Those who fell in love with his character in 'End of Watch' (2012), will be happy to know that once again he plays a really warm and human character. Jessica Chastain plays the Captain who had to order take-off. Her character is responsible for the Seventies disco-music used throughout the film to such great effect, especially in the scene which uses the song that started an era.It is good to see both Miss Chastain and Mr Damon in this film. They have both also appeared in 'Interstellar' (2014). The appearance of Mr Damon in that film was actually one of the highlights. 'Interstellar' actually, was a disappointment. An interesting dystopian start, and perhaps too brief sojourn to the planets, was marred, ruined in fact, by a dreadful last third of the film. However, here, in 'The Martian', we have the film that 'Interstellar' could have been, and should have been.While praise is due to all the cast, in reality they play small roles in this film. Matt Damon has to shoulder a lot of the burden in this film. His performance is in fact a tour-de-force. Facing death, he records his thoughts for posterity, using cameras, thus also supplying us, the audience, with explanation and exposition.As said, this is not Matt Damon's first trip into space. As well as the aforementioned 'Interstellar' in 2014, in the previous year of 2013, Mr Damon also appeared in another exciting SF story, 'Elysium', which also had some hard social comment in it too. Nothing new for Mr Damon, 'Promised Land' (2012), was a serious film that tackled a serious issue. However, the talented Mr Damon can also deliver a performance that balances romance and comedy, as in his role as a suave but bad-French-speaking character, in the true story 'The Monuments Men', a film that perfectly balanced humour and seriousness.'The Martian' is directed well by Ridley Scott. The 3D version shows well the Martian scenery, basically massive mountains and wide sandy valleys. The scenes in space are perhaps some of the most breathtaking and gripping. Drew Goddard's screenplay comes from Andy Weir's book.Those of you who enjoyed seeing Tom Hanks have a problem in 'Apollo 13' (1995), will recognize a similar NASA and similar themes. So too, those Sandra Bullock fans, who were wowed by her performance in 'Gravity', will also find familiarity. If you liked those films, you will enjoy 'The Martian' too. Perhaps not the most action-packed film, it is after all basically about one man alone on a big planet, the film does build up the excitement and the tension as it heads to it's climax. The last couple of scenes could be described as an unnecessary anti-climax, however as they play out, you realize why they are there.Top marks for a top film! 10/10.",Null,4,18,6 October 2015
