Black Swan," Neither Fish Nor Fowl
","Black Swan is brilliantly directed and impeccably acted. But beyond that, I'm not sure how impressed we should be. It uses masterful technique to sell shallow and possibly fallacious insights.On a dramatic level, the film shows us a feeble, repressed, self-destructive person, who - despite being offered an unimaginable opportunity - spends most of the running time whining, panicking, or blubbering. This may be a valid basis for a story (albeit a dreary one), but it offers very little in the way of novelty or nuance. There are no detours in Nina's character arc. You can fill in the ending of the film after watching the first five minutes.Black Swan also misrepresents the creative process. The 'obsessive, self-destructive ballerina' is a tired cliché, which didn't ring true in The Red Shoes, and doesn't hold up any better here. Ballet, like any art, is NOT produced by mystically 'losing yourself.' It's created through long hours of intense, tightly-focused and highly-skilled effort. In other words: boring WORK. 'Talent' is 90% perspiration; obsession and psychosis are entirely optional. (And not particularly common.)Aronofsky does a beautiful job of presenting Nina's inner journey in visual, symbolic terms. But that journey is neither pleasant nor particularly instructive. Nina's failing is ultimately no more than a lack of commitment.",6,3,4,15 June 2014
Captain Phillips," Fine docu-drama but not much more
","I'm a big fan of Paul Greengrass, but it seems that in Captain Phillips he was trying too hard not to take sides, having perhaps taken too much criticism for the partisanship of his brilliant films Bloody Sunday and Green Zone. It's not that I felt this new film desperately needed to make a political statement. It's just that it fails to make any statement at all. Or even to provide basic context for the events it depicts.The production is certainly impeccable. The shipboard settings, the procedures, and Tom Hanks' character are so totally believable that it's easy to forget you're not watching a documentary. (*Mild spoilers*...) Hanks' initial efforts to safeguard his crew, and to calm the pirates, are clever and engrossing. But at some point, that impetus evaporates, and we're left with a very realistic, very tense situation in which the lead character no longer plays any part other than that of helpless victim. Things unwind like clockwork, with no particular twists or surprises. That may be how it happened, but it's not how to make a great action film.I did appreciate Greengrass' effort to humanize the pirates. (If there's an Oscar going for this film, it belongs to Barkhad Abdi, for his nuanced performance as the pirate leader.) But the film stops short of any real exploration of the social or political pressures behind the incident it depicts. It fails to comment on the astounding spectacle of multiple billion-dollar navy ships and SEAL teams doing battle with four guys in a dinghy. It doesn't even address the obvious question of why a valuable merchant ship, registered in the most gun-happy country on Earth, and traveling through known pirate waters, doesn't have a weapons locker, or a security guard, or a single personal sidearm.Tom Hanks is excellent as always, but this is not an Oscar-worthy *role*. Hanks plays on just two notes: first restrained and competent, then shifting quite abruptly to broken and terrified. This seems very realistic, and it's perfectly played. But it's just not that interesting. The script does little to analyze Phillips' eventual breakdown; it merely notes it as one more part of the scenario.Bottom line, I enjoyed watching Captain Phillips, and I greatly admired the technique of both Greengrass and Hanks. But I didn't find the film particularly insightful, memorable or - considering the lack of character development or plot - exciting. It stands up well enough as a simple document of an actual event, but fails to tell me why that event might have been important enough to merit a big-budget movie treatment.",7,0,0,10 February 2014
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Leave Your Preconceptions Behind
","I know it's fashionable to scorn the 'prequel' trilogy, but if one stands back a bit, things tend to snap into perspective. Compare 'Phantom Menace' to most any other fantasy/sci-fi film, and it has to rate very high indeed.Plot: this is the more 'adult' side of the Star Wars galaxy. The politics are remarkably credible, with the entire plot hinging on the result of a vote of no-confidence! How many adults even know what that is? (Hmm... maybe this explains the low ratings.) The relationships between the races on Naboo, the role of the Jedi... these things are established more clearly, and depicted more credibly than in any of the other five films.Technical achievement: Lucas paints on a vast digital canvas, and creates a world of wonders that have simply never been imagined by lesser talents. This is a living, breathing, believable world, that makes the world of the original trilogy seem cartoonish and contrived by comparison. Naboo, from the city, to the underwater kingdom, to the rolling green hills, is one of the great fantasy worlds, up there with those of the Thief of Baghdad (both versions), Blade Runner, or 2001. And our first glimpse of Coruscant has got to be one of the most memorable 'wow' moments in the history of the movies.Characters: Liam Neeson's Qui Gon is one of the strongest characters in the Star Wars films, and Ewan McGregor's Obi Wan a worthy, more-dashing successor to the older version created by Alec Guinness. And Jar Jar Binks? Annoying? Not compared to the insipid C-3PO, or the insufferably perky R2-D2. Jar Jar is a fully formed character, with surprising depths. His manner is odd, perhaps abrasive, but he offers far more than the single note that Lucas used for his original comic-relief characters. And, of course, the fact that he is one of the first fully digital characters in film history has to be worth something. But Ian McDiarmid's Senator Palpatine is perhaps the most under-appreciated of all. This is an Oscar-worthy supporting performance, a character who is both frighteningly real and perfectly ambiguous. McDiarmid balances his performance on a knife's edge, managing to be both fatherly and deeply unsettling.Yes, it may be that a certain human dimension is weaker here than in the original Star Wars. We don't have a clear 'hero'. There's no Luke, no Han. That's a valid point, but it is not inevitably a criticism. Qui Gon and Obi Wan aren't the comic-book heroes of A New Hope, but they are likable, heroic, and rich in characterization. If I had a choice between seeing 10 more episodes of the life of Han Solo or of Qui Gon Jinn, I'd choose the latter without hesitation.Story: The storyline in this film seems more real, more substantial than in the other five. We have the perfect sense of scale, from human drama to global (or interstellar) conflict. The one quibble might be the pod race. It's certainly entertaining, but does it go on too long? I think perhaps so. This is a structural weakness, but not a huge one. (Does Luke spend WAY too long on Dagobah, listening to warmed over Zen platitudes from that rubbery little jerk Yoda? Yes! Yet this is in the film most viewers seem to, unaccountably, pick as the 'best' of the six. Clearly, there's some latitude for narrative digressions...)And then there's the climactic sword fight. I'd rate the three-way duel in Phantom Menace as the second-best sword fight in the Star Wars series, close after the finale of Return of the Jedi. The latter has a wonderful mythic quality, but this one is more visceral, more scary... partly because Darth Maul is such a cold, merciless villain, and partly because you know from the outset that the outcome is genuinely in doubt, that one of the Good Guys really could die. And the staging, using three master swordsmen, each with very different technique... This is just about as good as action film gets. Only two or three other movie duels come close: Rob Roy, again with Neeson, oddly enough; Scaramouche; Robin Hood... I can't think of a fourth. The closing duel ALONE should raise Phantom Menace into the front ranks of action and fantasy films.Bottom line: there is so much to enjoy in this film, so much to see, so much to feel, that it is amazing how anyone can possibly rate it below a 7 or 8. This is a scale of film making that few have ever attempted, let alone pulled off so beautifully. Perhaps that's the film's biggest fault: Lucas makes it all seem too easy.But, of course, we all know the REAL reason people can't give this film the 10 it richly deserves. That reason lies within themselves. Viewers in 1999 (let alone 2007) just couldn't feel as young, as innocent, as optimistic as they did when they saw the very first Star Wars. (Especially if they saw it way back in 1977, 30 years ago). Star Wars hasn't changed, George Lucas hasn't changed, nearly so much as the audience has changed. Alas. Moviegoers who are truly so jaded that they can't feel the passion and revel in the breadth of vision of The Phantom Menace have my sincerest sympathy. Yes, you can be ever so-o cool by putting down the prequel trilogy, but missing one of the best movies of all time is a very high price to pay.",10,169,267,28 January 2007
Sucker Punch," Huge Disappointment
","Zack Snyder is a brilliant director. That doesn't automatically make him a competent neurosurgeon, or a trophy-winning stunt pilot. And it sure as heck doesn't make him a halfway passable writer.Sucker Punch is a beautifully directed mess. The story - especially the ending - is so incoherent it's difficult to judge the film's meaning or message. Or even decide whether it had one. The title, in particular, seems to have no other meaning than as a warning to the viewer: this film IS a 'sucker punch.' Drop your guard, and it will steal two hours of your life. And I say this as a huge fan of Snyder's previous work, and someone with a very high tolerance for surrealist fantasies (from directors like Gilliam, del Toro and others.)Sucker Punch does have some redeeming virtues. The largely female cast is appealing, though saddled with some of the most dreadfully lame dialog ever uttered by human lips. The visual style is great, as you'd expect from Snyder. The imagery, mixing B-25, Zeppelins, zombie stormtroopers and dragons, is borderline brilliant - but wasted. Alas, the music is particularly gruesome, consisting of lifeless, over-produced generic re-workings of classic rock tunes like White Rabbit. Had the music had any spark of creativity, the film might actually have worked as some sort of lengthy music video.I guess after adapting the work of great writers like Frank Miller and Alan Moore, Snyder got to thinking it didn't look so hard. He was wrong. Writing is the most difficult of all creative skills. Let's hope that for his next project Snyder comes to his senses and remembers his core skills as a director, and leaves the writing to those with some minimal talent for it.",3,2,7,29 August 2011
3:10 to Yuma," As the Crowe Flies
","It's so great to see a really whole-hearted Western again, that it's easy to overlook this film's (admittedly subtle) faults.Its greatest virtue, of course, is Russell Crowe's performance, predictably superior to Glenn Ford's in the original. Crowe is at once likable, evil, amoral and philosophical... perfectly representing that strange mixture that's really the core of this story.The greatest failing is Christian Bale, who once again emotes most proficiently without ever kindling any real fire. Van Heflin, a fairly wooden actor at best, is far more sympathetic as the rancher desperate to prove himself. As with his previous travesty of Bruce Wayne, Bale seems unable to underplay, to create the sense of suppressed emotion that these roles emphatically require.Direction in this new version is visually dynamic and highly entertaining. It's only when you compare scene for scene that you realize how much more economical -- and hence powerful -- the original was. Best example: the original sets up Heflin's need to impress his son largely in a single shot. The new version inserts a whole sub-plot without achieving that same emotional tension.Another key change: the focus of the original is on the long, sweaty wait in the hotel room, during which Glenn Ford tries every trick to undermine Heflin's resolve. The new film abbreviates this brilliant philosophical battle of wills to a single exchange, and substitutes new action scenes that are fun, but far less substantial. (And do nothing to advance our understanding of either Crowe's or Bale's characters.)All in all, the new 3:10 to Yuma is a very good film, that does better by the source material than most remakes. But the original remains the superior work of art. Still, I'd be happy to watch either one any day of the week.",7,1,3,3 January 2008
Skyfall," Impossible to Rate
","Skyfall isn't really a movie at all, so much as about three or four movies loosely crunched together. On its own, any one of those movies might have been pretty good. Run together as a 'medley,' they make a pretty chaotic and frustrating experience.There's the missing spy-list, Bond-is-dead thing. There's a really good one-on-one foot chase through downtown London (practically the only locale Bond hasn't previously visited). Plus another chase, with motorcycles on rooftops in Istanbul. There's the spooky abandoned-city sequence (culminating in the most abrupt departure of a significant character I can recall seeing in any Bond movie). And then there's the Straw Dogs finale, with a barely-armed Bond holed up in Scottish hovel.Oddly, I didn't hate all this. Each of the segments had things in it that were entertaining, surprising, occasionally even clever. They don't add up to much, true enough. But what does *any* Bond movie add up to? Even the best of them consist of loosely strung-together action sequences. That's not to say Skyfall is a good movie. But it's not without some entertainment value. The action sequences are pretty good. The range of locations is better than usual. The lack of gadgets is refreshing. The title song is good. The new Q is a huge improvement over the last few versions. Javier Bardem is a great over-the-top-villain, even if his character really doesn't make much sense. I also enjoyed seeing Daniel Craig once more as Bond, even though this third film does very little to cash in on his off-beat Bond persona.Skyfall is not quite the least of the Bond films. I certainly wouldn't recommend it to a casual viewer... But I think Bond completists can find quite a bit in it to enjoy, if they can get over their entirely understandable sense of disappointment.",5,1,25,3 February 2013
E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," Pure Torment
","This is one of the worst films I've ever forced myself to sit through. I'm astounded that audiences are taken in by its paper-thin veneer of manufactured warmth and cuddliness, and blinded to its gaping flaws as drama. ET is to beloved childhood films (say, The Yearling, or Sammy Going South, or The Thief of Bagdad, or any of Disney's best works) what the Twinky is to homemade apple strudel.I'll leave aside the obvious contrivances of the concept, and the utter lack of likability of the rubberized title character. Instead, I'll note the main element that made me detest this film: the manipulative illogic of the central premise. We are expected to see the parents as the villains, even though they're clearly not. We are expected to cheer the brave, resourceful kids who actually accomplish nothing other than a needless escape from people who are clearly trying to help them.There's no other semblance of tension here, so if that collapses - and it does, in a great putrid, oozing ball of schmaltz - there's precious little left. Spielberg is a brilliant technician, and he's made a few truly outstanding films. But ET is Spielberg at his soppy, sentimental, nauseating worst. An agonizing thing to watch.Avoid, if at all possible. And above all, give your kids a more nourishing myth to sustain them in their later years.",2,5,13,22 June 2015
Gravity," Cosmic Drivel dressed up with Cosmetic CG
","Many others have pointed out what a stinker this film is, but no amount of criticism is truly enough. So I'm adding my own.Gravity fails in two ways.1. Physics. Yes, physics. If you base a film in space, and pretend to be realistic, you do need to have a grasp of high-school physics. And when major, MAJOR plot points depend on a total violation of physics, what you've got is an epic failure of a movie. I liked the realistic silence, but when George Clooney 'falls' away from Sandra Bulluck, despite there being nothing whatsoever to pull him away, I stopped caring about further events in this film.2. Story. There is none. Well, very little - but what there is makes almost no sense. Sandra Bullock is in a disaster, and she miraculously escapes. She's a trained astronaut who has all these weird emotional problems? She fantasizes about Clooney's ghost? She manages to figure out a control panel labeled in Chinese? Oh, please, spare me.I've seen space adventure done better in B-movies of the 1950s. Above all, this film is mis-titled. It takes place in free fall, therefore 'gravity' plays no role in it! A better title would have been 'Action and Reaction.' But the writers clearly didn't understand such a deep concept. So they went with Gravity because it seemed catchy. Ugh.If you want to see how this kind of space-survival story SHOULD be handled, read Andy Weir's brilliant The Martian. Let's hope Ridley Scott doesn't spoil that, in his upcoming screen adaptation. But it would be very difficult to dumb it down worse than Gravity.",1,4,7,15 May 2015
Se7en," I deeply regret seeing this movie
","I'm sorry I can't give this film a negative rating, but I can say that I wish most sincerely that I'd never seen it. If I could pay to have it expunged from my memory, I would do so eagerly. If it's not too late for you, I strongly recommend that you give it a wide berth.(Spoiler ahead.)Se7en (a pretentiously dyslexic title) is nasty, violent, unpleasant and, worst of all, utterly futile. While being regaled by sadistically repellent scenes of torture, you're stuck following a protagonist who hasn't the brains to figure out an utterly transparent trap, which a moron could see coming a mile down the avenue. This makes the experience of watching Se7en a nightmare, all right, but not the sort the director intended. Jonathan Miller once said that his own worst nightmare was 'being tortured for information I don't possess.' Se7en is like that. You pay for bad decisions you had no part in making. Except one: the foolish decision to watch this repulsive mess of a movie rather than, say, going to have your teeth drilled.The 'twist ending' is a dangerous form, and rarely has it been more abysmally, ham-fistedly mis-handled than in this film. Some people seem to think that dark, dismal, depressing... and don't forget futile... is the same as 'deep.' This film is as deep as a puddle of vomit. I strongly recommend you benefit from my error, and avoid stepping in it.",1,43,97,20 October 2006
Star Trek," Tripe, not Trek
","This movie is bad on so many levels, it's hard to know where to begin.First off, it's lousy Trek; Gene Roddenberry would have hated it. It has NOTHING to do with 'going where no one has gone before' or 'seeking out new life and new civilizations.' It has everything to do with blowing stuff up real good. But never mind - let's assume it's perfectly okay for a 'reboot' to dump *everything* that made the original worthwhile. That still leaves the inescapable fact that this new 'Star Trek' doesn't work even as trashy melodrama. Let me itemize just a few points:* Basing a film titled 'Star Trek' on time travel is a textbook example of 'jumping the shark.' If our entire galaxy seems too small to provide sufficient plot hooks, screenwriters Orci and Kurtzman should seek some other line of work, better suited to boring dimwits totally devoid of imagination...* ... and incapable of concocting even a rudimentary storyline. 'Nasty guy destroys planets' isn't a story, it's just a really, really tired cliché. It's also exactly the sort of feeble plotting that killed the Enterprise series. You'd think someone would have noticed.* Assuming you're short of ideas, why omit Kirk's three years at Star Fleet Academy? This is exactly the part of his life we know least about. (And while we're at it: why have Kirk beaten up, over and over and over? I count four or five separate pummelings. If it's some sort of in-joke, it's not funny... just distracting and tedious.)* Getting down to plot: why does Star Fleet suddenly put all its cadets into active service? So... they have *ships*, apparently... but no crews??* Why does Spock maroon Kirk on an obviously deadly planet? Doesn't the Enterprise have a BRIG?? And is this sort of ad hoc death sentence actually approved by Star Fleet regulations?* How is it that Kirk arrives at a random spot on a random planet, then gets chased by a monster until he's thoroughly lost... then suddenly bumps into the one person in the galaxy who can solve all his problems??* Isn't it just *slightly* implausible that Spock should abruptly resign his command, in favor of someone he apparently hates (and whom he recently sentenced to death), just because he loses his temper for a moment?* Why does the Enterprise have ridiculously convoluted water pipes in its engine room, leading inevitably to a huge blender? This sequence with Scotty made me think of the far better film Galaxy Quest - which at least knew it was a spoof.* And WHAT is it with the decor? None of the Enterprise interiors even remotely suggest a spacecraft of any kind. The new Bridge looks like a Hong Kong disco. * When we get to the ending, didn't ANYONE else feel nauseous watching Kirk's obvious glee at the death of the Romulans?? At that moment, my sympathies were overwhelmingly with Nero, given that the Star Fleet jerks were being no less vengeful, and way more self-righteous about it. Never mind Roddenberry's grand vision of the future - the message here is that it feels SO GREAT to kill, when you're sure you've got the Right on your side. Just what the world needs: lynch-mob morality for the 21st Century.* And then, the final insult: cadet Kirk gets his very own starship, day one. Without serving as, say, an Ensign, or a First Officer. Has this sort of thing *ever* happened in the history of the world's navies?? Fortunately, by this point there really isn't any credibility left to demolish.When I heard JJ Abrams was doing a Star Trek movie, I knew it would not be like the traditional Trek. Boy, was I wrong. This movie fits perfectly into the tradition of goofball space opera, alongside such previous big-screen embarrassments as The Search for Spock, or The Voyage Home. (All of which fall light-years short of any of the TV shows.) What I DIDN'T expect, given Abrams' track record, is that the movie would fail on the level of basic storytelling.I also have to say that reading through the IMDb trivia listings for this film really made me angry. Given that the film's creators obviously care nothing for the Trek tradition, the endless sly Trek references they've inserted can only be seen as a condescending effort to seduce the serious fans. Wake up, Trekkies: these guys are flaunting their utter contempt for you and everything you care about. They're not laughing with you, they're laughing at you... all the way to the bank.Ultimately, I suppose this 'Star Trek' isn't worth getting upset about - just one more bad pseudo-SF movie in an endless stream of brainless Hollywood space operas. But what really galls is this particular film's insane popularity, and the seemingly endless list of 10/10 ratings. I guess the movie-going public really will lap up anything with enough explosions in it. I'd thought that Trekkies might have higher standards, but again, use the names 'Kirk' and 'Spock' and I guess any sort of garbage becomes acceptable.Slap all the perfect scores on it you like, garbage remains garbage. I give this film three stars purely for the obvious talent of its young cast. Too bad they're all going to be stuck repeating this cinematic disaster for the next ten years.",3,16,22,16 July 2009
Fury," Not the film I was expecting
","Having scanned the reviews of Fury, I was expecting a typical 'how we won the war' kind of B movie, with all the clichés in place. But that's not what I discovered upon watching the film. This is one of the more powerful anti-war statements I've ever seen on the screen, cleverly put together, tightly directed and remarkably well-acted.The title tells you what the film is about: *fury*. The fury that overcomes soldiers in war. This film, better than any other I've seen, demolishes the myth of the heroic warrior. Instead, what we see are the degraded, brutalized monsters that war creates. Brad Pitt, in particular, is brilliant as an utterly horrific character. He perfectly represents what a person must become in order to be an effective soldier.The focus of the story is on Pitt training a new member of the tank crew, a young guy who's previously only been a clerk. Pitt tries to tear apart this man's humanity as quickly as possible, for his own good and the good of the whole crew. At first, we can only see Pitt as an evil madman. But events in the film gradually prove that his attitude is the only valid response to the insane circumstances.The focus is on the US troops, but there's no favoritism. The action takes place at the very tail end of the European war, with the US marching through Germany. But the Germans (quite accurately) are shown as still highly disciplined, still dangerous, willing to fight to the last man. This movie isn't even remotely about which side was 'right' and which was 'wrong.' It's about the experience of the troops who are forced to make up in blood for what the politicians have failed to achieve with diplomacy.Previous war films have always held back a bit, stopped short of showing us the full horror of war. This one goes several steps further, and is therefore far more successful at showing us why soldiers return to society as crazed wrecks. This is the only film I can think of that really gives us a gut-feel for what PTSD is all about. We see what happens to men when they're forced to abandon their humanity in order to simply 'get the job done.' Ultimately, even survival becomes a secondary consideration. By the end, we begin to understand - with massive irony - what a 'good soldier' truly is. What he *has* to be.I wouldn't recommend Fury to everyone. The level of violence is gut-wrenching, partly in terms of visual gore, but even more strongly in terms of emotions. Things happen in this film that are truly beyond all reason, logic or morality. But that's exactly the point. Fury is a brutal, nasty movie, but it does give us at least a dim sense of war is *really* like. And therefore, what a heinous, unforgivable crime we commit when we allow wars to happen.",9,10,18,25 October 2015
World War Z," Good Genre Film
","I'm not sure what baggage I was supposed to bring to my viewing of World War Z, but I guess it got left behind, because I couldn't see much wrong with the film. It's an above-average entry in the zombie genre, and sufficiently well made to amuse casual viewers as well.World War Z reminded me of several other films I've greatly enjoyed. It has the fast zombies and epidemiological viewpoint of 28 Days Later. It has the exciting round-the-world quest of Roland Emmerich's 2012. And it even borrows a bit from the cult favorite Plane Dead. The action sequences are spectacular, the acting is solid, and the whole package is very satisfying.It's true, there are a few obvious lapses in logic, but nothing that shouldn't be forgivable in a genre film like this. An early example: if the plague takes 12 seconds to convert a living human into a zombie (a novel idea, in itself), how could it be spread by air travellers? Everyone on board a plane ought to be dead before the doors are sealed. But the general sense of the film is good. All you need to know is it's a contagion, and we need to fight it using medical science, as opposed to, say, wooden stakes and garlic.World War Z won't be mistaken for a work of genius, but it is a lot of fun. Break out the popcorn, and don't let nit-picking reviews put you off.",8,1,1,13 March 2016
Passengers," Better than Expected, in Unexpected Ways
","After seeing many lukewarm or negative reviews, I watched Passengers with low expectations. Having seen it, I'm aware of its logical shortcomings. But overall, I liked it a lot - for reasons I really never expected.At its core, this is not an adventure - it's a very unusual love story. It's about a love born of disaster, desperation and even heinous selfishness. And yet, it's a love that we come to appreciate as the story slowly unfolds. This film works remarkably well on a dramatic level. The two stars are extremely likable, and do a fine job of presenting a wide range of emotions, despite the limited scope of the story. (There are also a few smaller parts that work very well - notably the mechanized bartender.)Even more surprisingly, Passengers succeeds in evoking that bona fide SF 'sense of wonder,' as we contemplate the lives of two people living alone on a huge starship, while 5,000 others remain inaccessible in hibernation. It's a fascinating vision, depicted quite powerfully.On a purely mechanical level, the results are somewhat more mixed. The film does look terrific. The starship is elegant and believable. But the film's respect for real-world physics, on the other hand, hits both highs and lows.On the up side, there are several maneuvers in zero gravity that are really quite clever, handled infinitely better than we've seen in such critically-acclaimed dreck as Gravity (which also lacked the powerful emotional side of Passengers). On the down side, we have a ship that loses centrifugal gravity by suddenly ceasing to spin. Not only is there no reason for it to stop spinning, we don't see the horrible carnage that inertia would create inside the ship after a sudden stop. There's also a scene with fusion plasma that's needlessly implausible, not so much because of poor physics, as because of lazy writing.On balance, however, the scientific underpinnings are more than adequate to carry the film's genuinely compelling drama. Ignore the few inevitable quibbles, and Passnegers works really well as both SF and romance. It leaves you with some novel insights into human nature, and a genuinely haunting central image.I have to deduct a point or two on the technical side, but even so I give the film a very strong recommendation. It's entertaining, likable and thought-provoking, and I will definitely watch it again.",7,2,4,5 March 2017
Spider-Man 3," Excellent (despite what critics have said)
","Having heard many of the lukewarm (to put it kindly) reviews, I went to see this film with no expectations whatsoever. Imagine my surprise when it turned out to be absolutely the equal of the other two in every way.I still find the criticism incomprehensible, other than as some sort of 'pack' phenomenon. Perhaps, feeling they've over-praised installments one and two, people feel the need to balance the scales by trashing number three. I simply don't know.What I do know is that on any meaningful basis, this is a great movie. It's more reminiscent of it's immediate predecessor, in that it strikes a - very marginally - better balance of action and drama than the original, and in that the CGI effects do a better job of humanizing the Spider-Man figure.Other than that, it's all the same good stuff. Raimi's genius in this series lies in realizing what made the original comic (i.e. the first 38 Ditko/Lee issues, as opposed to the several hundred issues of filler that followed) so wonderful: this is a story about Peter Parker, troubled, geeky teenager... NOT about Spider-Man, omnipotent super-hero. Raimi never lets you forget that. (The one negative consequence is a propensity for tearing off Spider-Man's mask... If it ripped that easily, the whole secret-identity thing would be a total loss right from the start.)Yes, like many other fans, when I heard that this film would have no less than three villains - 'Son of Goblin,' Venom and Sandman - I was concerned. No need. Raimi balances the three effortlessly, weaving them in and out of a single storyline, which remains relentlessly focused on Peter Parker. Raimi uses each villain (plus the competing newspaper photographer, and of course MJ) to counterpoint a different aspect of Parker's psyche. The action scenes flow from this, and hence each has real meaning, never degenerating into mere CGI slug-fest for its own sake.The dialog, the characterizations... they're just what they should be. This IS a comic book, and one of the more wacky and surreal ones to come from Marvel in its glory days. This movie mixes moments of excitement, humor and tragedy in just the right Marvel proportions, and on just the right slightly-larger-than-life scale. (Soap opera? Heck, yeah! Did it really take forty years for anyone to notice?)I have only three real quibbles. One, the endless Stan Lee cameo; fifteen seconds with his ego is like an eon in purgatory. (Hats off to the brilliant, irascible Steve Ditko for not even wanting his name in the credits.) Second, the giant-sized version of Sandman; it's unnecessary, and really only weakens the emotional impact of Sandman as a human-scale threat. And third, Peter Parker's big line at the end of the climactic fight; it's more awkward than it could have been. But these are minor points, and none of them diminishes my admiration and affection for this film.Some might say there's a fourth point: Peter Parker's ego-tripping in the middle part of the movie is SO well done, it does get painful to watch. I'm sure this is deliberate, and it's certainly not unfaithful to certain aspects of the comic. Raimi does a great job of depicting a guy who's making a TOTAL jerk of himself. That's kind of the whole point. These episodes create a contrast for the nobler side of Parker, which of course must come through if he's to pull things together in the end. I think we can all see ourselves in this. (Aside, maybe, from a few of us who really ARE total jerks, and have yet to discover that they even have a nobler side.)As I said, I have no idea what people found lacking in Spider-Man 3. It may be significant that many of the loudest criticisms are non-specific, of the 'this was utter crap' variety. Maybe what we're hearing is the vague disappointment of fans who came late to the party and got hooked on later, 'cooler' versions of Peter Parker, and can't abide the notion that their hero could even HAVE a geeky, awkward side...Who knows? My advice: take a chance and check out Spider-Man 3 for yourself, with an open mind. I, for one, saw a great movie here. Maybe you'll get lucky and see it too.",9,2,3,17 June 2007
Midnight in Paris," Weaker Woody
","Midnight in Paris looks and feels great. But there's not enough substance under that haze of nostalgic charm.The premise is up there with Woody's best: a frustrated writer pines for the glory days of between-the-wars Paris. Then he (inexplicably) time-travels, and has a chance to learn about writing, and life, from the likes of Ernest Hemingway and F. Scott Fitzgerald.Unfortunately, those tips are really not very interesting. In fact, after about the halfway point, they seem to dwindle away, as our hero gets more caught up in the practicalities of time-travel, and the romantic entanglements. The ending, when it arrives, is a let-down - an ancient sci-fi clichÃ©, that pays off on none of the film's early promise. (I felt like I'd time traveled back to the 1960s and met Rod Serling.)Owen Wilson, one of the most annoying screen personalities of all time, turns in a mercifully subdued, un-mannered performance, for once. The rest of the cast is even better, and it's fun to see Adrien Brody as Salvador Dali, or Kathy Bates as Gertrude Stein. But these celebrity cameos are too rushed; we never really get any insight into these admittedly fascinating historical personalities.Midnight in Paris does have a wonderfully romantic look and feel, but its true potential is never achieved. It's a pleasant, but unfulfilling way to spend 90 minutes.",4,0,2,25 August 2013
The Way Back," Not to be Taken Too Literally
","It is pointless to review this film as if it were a typical adventure-drama. For Weir, essence is what matters.In The Way Back, Weir very deliberately pulls back from his characters and the detail of their story. That's not a flaw - it's a tip-off. This is NOT a narrative about four men who endure hell to escape from the gulag. It's a meditation on Endurance itself.Weir does confuse the issue a bit, with a surprisingly literal montage sequence at the end. Perhaps he felt a concrete pay-off was needed, a decades-later denouement. But those few closing images are not really a part of the journey - merely a suggestion that it does have an ending.As long as you remain focused on the journey itself, it all makes perfect sense. And it's all hauntingly beautiful. There are no tragedies along the way - merely people who finish their own journey a little sooner, or who turn off in a different direction. There are moments of wry humor, and deep emotion. And a quietly growing bond between men who have nothing in common but the journey, and their individual capacity to endure it.Could a group of men actually survive a trek such as the one suggested in this film? If you're still asking that question, you definitely saw the wrong movie.",9,1,2,7 May 2011
The Best Years of Our Lives," A supremely likable drama, yet worthy of deeper reflection...
","I love this film. Hollywood has rarely achieved more compelling - and likable - human drama. This is a glossy and romanticized slice of Americana, yet it tells a powerfully real story. It's got great screen stars - most notably Fredric March - doing some of the best work of their careers. And it has absolutely impeccable direction by William Wyler - so polished that you have to work hard to pull back and actually notice the sophisticated techniques at work.The film's only limitation is one it can't avoid: it's of its time and place. This is a 1946 Hollywood film about the aftermath of global conflict that had only just ended. It's a work that tackles a deeply political topic, from within the period it tries to capture. This inherent difficulty comes through in one subtle way and in one overt scene.The subtle slant comes from what we don't see. For example, we aren't shown the many soldiers who were far worse off than our three protagonists. Homer Parrish does mention that his own shocking disability is actually one of the milder ones he's seen. The film passes this off as casual heroism on his part, when it's in fact all the lip service that's given those who paid a much higher price than this film's relatively lucky trio. All three of whom swiftly find supremely happy endings - surely, not a statistically realistic outcome. This can be thought of as subliminal propaganda, no doubt, but it's mostly just artistic license - a way of sugar-coating some hard truths for the benefit of a war-weary public.The one overt bit of actual propaganda comes in the scene in which Homer gets in a fight with a guy at the lunch counter, who dares to question the political rationale behind the war. If you listen carefully, this man actually says nothing derogatory regarding the troops. Although his manner is made deliberately obnoxious, what he says repeatedly is simply: 'get the facts, learn for yourself.' An admonition that should never be controversial, in a free society. Yet when Homer snatches away the man's flag lapel pin, the message seems to be that some topics are simply too important to be examined rationally, because, well... patriotism. Once you've spent enough lives, it's no longer acceptable to question whether the tactics were wise or the cause just.We can only hope that this point of view may look a lot more dangerous now, than it must have in 1946. But, to its credit, the film can also be read another way. It does at least hint that the two servicemen are in fact over-reacting. That they probably should question the official narrative, but that their memories are still too painful. Is the scene helping create an attitude of denial... or consciously reflecting upon one that inevitably did exist? I suspect the subtlety is deliberate. Which is the most we could hope for in a mainstream film originating in this time and place.Obviously, any film must be viewed in the context of history. The Best Years of Our Lives must have been a revelation in 1946. A landmark, in going as far as it did in recognizing that the human cost of a war extends far beyond the conflict itself, even for the 'victors.' But today it remains above all a brilliant bit of human drama, a supremely skillful telling of three intertwining stories about characters that are at once noble, likable and credible. It's a film that takes real effort to analyze, simply because it's so overwhelmingly enjoyable.",9,4,4,18 November 2013
Suicide Squad," Doesn't Deserve the Hate
","I took a chance on Suicide Squad despite the non-stop barrage of hate from both fans and critics. And I was pleasantly surprised. No, this isn't a great film, but it is quite an enjoyable one. It lacks the self-importance and obsessive fan service of the more mainstream comics-based movies, which allows it to succeed as a simple bit of entertainment.The extended 'Dirty Dozen' setup works well, and the interplay between the seriously off-key characters pumps a bit of desperately needed fresh air into the superhero genre. The absence of major comic-book stars is a huge bonus, making the plot slightly less predictable.Don't view this as belonging to the 'DC Universe,' or the 'Batman canon,' or any other tired, anal-retentive fan framework. It's a simple, standalone movie, with cool characters and fast action. It's actually FUN, which is something you can't say about most comics-inspired films any more.",8,1,3,16 July 2017
Shutter Island," Elegant Drivel
","Scorsese is surely THE most over-rated American director of all time. I vowed never to see another of his bombastic travesties, but was lured into this one by the interesting premise. Alas, only to discover I was right all along. If Scorsese ever makes another good film, it will be purely by accident. He should stick to doing inane commentary on disc releases of other people's films.Shutter Island seems fine at first: a 'mystery wrapped in an enigma' sort of thing. But it gradually unravels, like all Scorsese's films, as he tries strenuously to demonstrate his genius, rather than simply telling an intelligent story. The ending is a final insult - of the 'aren't you sorry you bothered' variety. It's a silly trick that Rod Serling might have used for a half-hour TV diversion, and then only with a much-needed element of self-deprecating irony (a seasoning unfamiliar to the self-absorbed Mr. Scorsese).Scorsese knows how to move a camera around, and get good performances out of his actors. But if you value logic and meaning over surface gloss, you need to stay away from this piece of elegant drivel.",2,4,6,17 June 2013
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," Worthy Continuation of the Captain America Legend
","First, the short version: this is a very good action film, in the finest tradition of the Marvel machine. It hits all the right notes, from human drama to street-level action to full-on CG extravaganza. If you enjoyed any of the other Marvel films, you'll love this one.Now the longer version. There were two things I really liked about this installment.First, the storyline, which seems to have been instantaneously rewritten to reflect this past year's revelations about secretive governmental agencies. This movie is actually about something. I'm absolutely blown away that Marvel was willing to make such a strong, even controversial, political statement in what you might expect to be a 'throwaway' action flick.The second thing I liked was how Captain America himself has been evolved, in light of the very topical storyline. This is Steve Rogers, archetypal All-American Boy, attempting to grow beyond jingoist gun-battles with caricatures of evil. The previous movies have shown Rogers as being naive even for the 1940s. In Winter Soldier, we see Rogers holding up a perfect mirror to a 21st Century public. What does true patriotism consist of? Are we thinking through our decisions, balancing legitimate fears against the truly noble ideologies we profess?Deep stuff for a mere comic-book. The Winter Soldier marks Marvel's maturing in the medium of film, as it once did in the medium of printed comics. At some level, this is the superhero as an art form.Is it *good* art? The Winter Soldier does serve up a big helping of large-scale action in its final act, perhaps at the expense of character development, or plot. This is very much in keeping with the conventions of the genre, so it's hard to call it a flaw. But I was hoping that the lower-key approach of the first half of Winter Soldier might have extended just a bit further into the climax. Captain America is really at his best in the early fight against Batroc.But that's a very minor quibble. The Winter Soldier is an excellent action film, with more than enough substance to keep your brain from atrophying.Best of all, it's a really powerful, evocative cinematic rendering of one of the great comic-book heroes. I can't help wondering how Jack Kirby would have felt, seeing his patriotic creation of the 1940s brought spectacularly to life in a 9-figure 21st-Century production. I think, at the very least, he'd have been touched both by how faithfully his vision had been captured - and how admirably it had been progressed.",8,2,4,9 April 2014
Doctor Strange," Exactly What You'd Expect - Unfortunately
","Doctor Strange is THE quintessentially generic Marvel comic-book film. It executes the established formula with mechanical precision. The origin. The early training. The villain. The gratuitous quips. The evolution of The Costume. The Earth-shattering finale. It's all there.This makes for a fun film, but not a great one. What Doctor Strange really lacks is *strangeness.* The truly original vision that Steve Ditko brought to comics in the 1960s (and which numerous other creators have built on, over the years). The early plots were hokey, maybe, but they were original. The look and feel and concept of the comics was unusual, bizarre, like nothing that had gone before. It was that unique sense of style that set Doctor Strange comics apart.Doctor Strange, the film, is devoid of any style of its own. As the trailers correctly intimated, the visuals are largely swiped from Inception, and do absolutely nothing to capture the Ditko world of demented alternate dimensions. The look of the film is glossy and modern, where it should be bizarre and scary.The often-annoying Cumberbatch is actually not bad as Stephen Strange - but he's also not particularly good. He's really the same guy as Robert Downey's Tony Stark. Both of whom could easily be older Peter Parkers. He's yet another Generic Action Guy, laughing nervously in the face of cosmic dangers. Even though Doctor Strange was the one Marvel hero who was truly devoid of humor. His was a grim world of sorcery, not of levity, but of endless study and utter devotion to forbidden arts. There's none of that in this film.Doctor Strange is certainly worth seeing as two hours of light diversion. It's well-made and satisfying in its own terms. But coming after a decade of Marvel adaptations, it's also utterly forgettable. And a cosmic let-down to anyone who had any love for the original material. It's probably just about what Steve Ditko would have feared Hollywood would do to his work.",7,1,1,5 March 2017
Interstellar," Stupidity on a Grand Scale
","If this movie were set in, say, the Wonderful Land of Oz, it might stand up as a lightweight fantasy. Very lightweight. But dressed in the trappings of science fiction, it's simply appalling.True, it does look purdy, with all that computer graphic stuff slathered all over the screen. And it does tell a story, of sorts: the dad who wants to redeem himself in the eyes of his daughter. It actually could have worked. But the story meanders for hours and hours, and any semblance of logic is completely abandoned after the trip through the wormhole, making it very hard to care what happens.Just one example: the takeoff from Earth requires a multi-stage rocket on the scale of the Saturn V. The takeoff from a planet 'near the black hole,' (!) with 'gravity greater than Earth's' is handled effortlessly by a tiny shuttlecraft. The movie is filled with similar lapses in basic logic. The final events near (and inside!) the black hole are so completely lacking in scientific plausibility that they'd seem embarrassing in a ten-cent comic book. In a multi-hundred-million-dollar epic, the complete disregard of all known science borders on criminal.On the positive side, Interstellar is a better film than Gravity. The science is equally implausible, but the story doesn't depend on the science quite so obviously. Nonetheless, the popularity of feeble junk like this makes a sad comment on the state of knowledge and tastes in our 21st-century society.",3,8,14,8 April 2015
Watchmen," A deeply human adaptation
","As a huge fan of the graphic novel, I have to say that Zack Snyder has done about as good a job with this movie adaptation as was humanly possible. Yes, some elements were left out, but the omissions were wisely chosen. Yes, a few elements were modified. But again, the changes were done with enormous care and intelligence. In at least one case - the ending - I felt the film's (quite minor) modification was arguably superior to Alan Moore's original version. (It eliminates one factor that really has no other point of contact in the story, and substitutes a new irony that I think Moore himself might have appreciated.)What really won me over, though, was the human element. The largely unknown actors chosen to portray The Comedian, Night Owl, Silk Specter II and Rorschach not only look *uncannily* like the characters in the comic, they do an excellent job of fleshing them out. Carla Gugino deserves special note for her great portrayal of the aging Silk Specter I, and Matt Frewer is absolutely perfect as Moloch. And Billy Crudup handles the vague and disinterested Dr Manhattan with just the right subtlety. All of these actors deliver performances that are appropriately stylized, yet deeply human; they bring these characters to life for me in a way that static images on a page simply cannot.Largely because of this, I found that the movie quickly won me over. Not only as a worthwhile illumination of the comic book, but as a credible work in its own right. At first, I kept comparing each scene with its comic-book equivalent; but after about twenty minutes, I was swept up by the film and felt almost as though I were watching an entirely new creation.Visually, Watchmen does stay very close to Gibbons' original illustrations, but without being slavish about it. Scenes are allowed to flow and move cinematically, much more than in previous comic adaptations such as Sin City and Snyder's own 300. This really brings the comic to life and opens it up for the big screen, while leaving Gibbons' strange color palette and peculiar compositions clearly evident.Reading previous reviews, I sense disappointment from those who were seeking a slam-bang 'superhero' movie, akin to Dark Knight or Spider-Man. Of course, nothing could possibly have been further from Alan Moore's darkly cynical vision. Watchmen isn't about the action itself, but the motives behind it - something largely taken for granted by superhero comics. When these 'heroes' go into action, we're meant to not just feel their exhilaration, but also to question the brooding subconscious desires that drive it. (Not to mention the urges that fuel our own vicarious enjoyment.) What if 'The Dark Knight' *wasn't* pure in spirit, but was tainted by the same perverse passions that we see in ourselves? Unlike the Wachowski Brothers' superficial interpretation of 'V for Vendetta,' Snyder's Watchmen deserves credit for ducking none of Moore's toughest, most unsettling questions.The original remains the original, of course. Everyone should read Moore and Gibbons' masterpiece. But while Snyder's Watchmen may shine largely with borrowed brilliance, it does shine very brightly indeed.",9,5,10,11 March 2009
Knowing," Oh. My. God.
","This movie is bad in every way it is possible for a movie to be bad, and even invents a few new ones. I don't have a problem with the Aliens-are-Angels / Bible-is-History tripe, though god knows it's been done to death - no sci-fi editor would ever accept this kind of hackneyed rubbish at two cents a word. But this movie doesn't even make SENSE.* What's with the sheet of numbers that kicks off the whole story? We never find out. Why was this 'message' provided? (Never mind HOW.) And why in this peculiar way?? They numbers are almost impossible to decipher - surely super-powerful aliens (or angels from heaven) could have provided the information in a clearer form! (Even punctuation would have helped.) But either way, what's the point? Even once deciphered - by the wildest accident - it's clear that no one can actually do anything about this information. And it certainly has nothing to do with the resolution of the story.* Why does the girl in 1959 hide in the school basement and scratch her last few numbers in a door, instead of writing them down? Couldn't she find a pencil? And more importantly, why does she write all the death tolls as numbers, EXCEPT the very last one?? And why does she write just that one not only backwards (!!) but in some sort of l33t shorthand that pretty much guarantees anyone reading it would misinterpret it as '33'???* Why do ALL the other numbers refer to disasters, yet the very last one refer to an all-important rescue location? In fact, why bother specifying this rescue location, when the angels/aliens are apparently quite happy to grab the kids and take them there? Was it actually important for someone to get this 'message'? (And if so, why make it so $!@$%* hard to read???)* Later on, when Cage finds his son scribbling down numbers, why why WHY does he interrupt him?? (He actually tears the sheet of paper from under the kid's pencil.) At this point, Cage knows how important these numbers are. Wouldn't a further message be exactly what he'd want??* When Cage tries to save the two families, why does the mother first believe him then arbitrarily disbelieve him? Why do we spend twenty vital minutes in the last act of the movie watching Cage chasing her around?? Isn't this is a really, really annoying distraction from any huge plot about aliens / angels / the end of the world?* Why do the mysterious aliens/angels save only children? (And bunnies???) They seem powerful enough; why not save hundreds, or even thousands of educated experts? (Or dolphins? Or earthworms?) Why not deflect the solar flare? (They seem amply capable of such deeds.) And why wander around in the dark, scaring people before saving them? What do these men (no women) - or the events of the film - have to do with Biblical prophecies? Have these creatures been here before? Did they plant premonitions? If so, why??* What's the deal with the black rocks? They don't match any legend or Biblical reference I can think of. They have no obvious symbolic meaning. They don't even have any clear role within the plot (such as it is). The aliens/angels give one to the boy, which makes it seem special, a message maybe, or an amulet of some sort. Yet we later find them under the crazy lady's bed, and strewn ankle-deep in the woods. Hunh??* Why does the abandoned Cage suddenly seem to get Religion? (Or at least Faith.) Aliens came and saved his son. Cool. But it proves nothing about the universe in general. Human civilization is being arbitrarily destroyed. Not cool. In fact, such a monumentally hard thing to accept, it's very likely to make one flee to some sort of illusory refuge. Proves nothing, except that humans are weak and the Universe is full of arbitrarily cruel events. As Cage says right at the start: 'basically, sh*t just happens.' In this film, it certainly does.I guess devoutly religious viewers won't be put off by the lack of logic. But this isn't religion, it's fiction. How could tens of millions of dollars in hard Hollywood cash come to be squandered in filming such an appalling mess of a script? 'Knowing' makes M Night Shyamalan look like Stanley Kubrick. Did Proyas think he was expressing some genuine Christian spiritual revelation? If so, then he should realize that the fervor of one's beliefs doesn't magically negate all the basic laws of dramatic structure.I've been a huge fan of Proyas' previous work - not just Dark City, but also the enormously under-rated I Robot. Hopefully, with Knowing he's gotten something off his chest, and he'll be ready to go back to just making movies, as opposed to delivering apocalyptic revelations.",2,1,4,2 July 2009
Being John Malkovich," The Worst
","Why, oh why, is there no 'ZERO' on the ratings dropdown? This would be on my very short list for worst movie of all time.A. It's dumb. Very dumb. It's an un-funny one-line joke stretched out interminably. (The only good moment - I guess that's worth the '1' rating - is when SPOILER Malkovich 'becomes' himself; but that's not nearly enough for a whole movie.)B. It's smarmily, cloyingly, smugly artsy-fartsy, in a way no other movie I can think of ever pulls off. It wants me to be impressed by the way the film was loaded into the camera.C. It's bo-o-oring. It goes on, and on, and on. When I rented the DVD, my wife and I watched the latter half at increasing speeds. Even at 32x, it was really, really tedious.I guess the people who like this film all feel that they're the ones clever enough to 'get it.' No, sorry... just gullible enough to be 'got' by this pseudo-intellectual rubbish.",1,12,27,19 February 2007
The Amazing Spider-Man," Meh...
","This review is just as redundant as the movie itself. But I have to say it: The Amazing Spider-Man is an amazing waste of time. Not just mine, but that of the talented cast and crew.The first half of the movie re-treads Raimi's original Spider-Man, while adding needless twists and embellishments that only make it less effective in every way. The second half has Spidey trading punches with what has to be the most boring super-villain ever put on the screen. As a character, this Lizard makes Gojira look positively Shakespearean by comparison.The new plot points, such as those involving Peter's parents or Gwen Stacey are okay, but they're handled in a shallow, haphazard way that robs them of any interest. The new Parker personality is similarly okay, but never really developed. Why exactly does this goofball want to be a hero? Is he a nerd, or just a twit? Compared to Raimi's version, this character is vague, lacking in motivation and not particularly likable.I don't regret seeing The Amazing Spider-Man. It's a moderately pleasurable waste of two hours. But nothing more.",5,0,1,15 November 2012
Captain America: Civil War," Not Good
","Alas, this film marks the point at which the Marvel film franchise slipped from the realm of powerful drama with larger-than-life characters, into pure Biff! Pow! fan service, with colorful super-manikins pitted needlessly and inappropriately against each other.This slide is doubly sad, because the film starts so well. The question of vigilante justice has never been properly addressed in the superhero genre. Civil War starts by asking: what if the UN got involved? Should the Avengers yield their autonomy - their might-makes-right power, based purely on the accident of their own super-abilities? And furthermore, can even the UN or any other body be trusted to administer that kind of power?(Mild spoilers ahead.) That last question never gets properly asked, let alone answered. Instead, Civil War lapses into a succession of impressive but meaningless action sequences. Culminating in a completely unnecessary battle between every superhero in the Avengers side of the Marvel cinema franchise - and the total devastation of a major airport. Ironically, this is exactly the sort of billion-dollar collateral damage that the film starts out questioning. Now it goes by without any comment.Spider-Man is the most glaring insertion. He's completely superfluous to any plot line within the film. His presence is basically just an ad for the upcoming second reboot of his own franchise.Finally, there's the question of the 'civil war' itself. It's basically ludicrous. In the end, Iron Man learns something irrelevant, that causes him to totally lose his mind and nearly murder one of his closest friends. This goes far beyond even 'comic book logic,' into the realm of purely arbitrary plot twists. Director to script writer: 'It sez here that Cap and Shellhead pound on each other for 10 minutes - gimme a thin excuse, will ya?'Too bad. Civil War looks great, has stupendous CG action sequences (especially the earlier, more human-scale ones), and fine performances by a number of good actors. But it marks a sad turn toward measuring worth not by solid dramatic or cinematic standards, but by the number of punches landed and the number of superheroes that can be crammed onto the screen at any one time.We can hope this is an aberration, but it's a thin hope at best. This is how comics franchises traditionally die: strong ideas and deep characterization give way to mindless action and limp soap opera.",4,18,29,29 September 2016
The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug," Glossy but vacuous
","Lots of people seemed to feel the first Hobbit film was too slow, while the second nicely picked up the pace. Personally, I see the reverse.The first film was slow, but to some purpose. The lengthy intro in Hobbitton gives us some worthwhile characterization. As the expedition moves through the wild, the action builds to a suitable climax. It's all a bit overblown and over-hyped, but it works.In the second film, it's one endless action sequence after another. Barrel-riding on the river (in open, easily-swamped barrels) turns into a ludicrous extravaganza of 3D heroics by two characters who aren't even in the book - and who therefore can do nothing to advance the storyline of the movie. But the final battle with Smaug is even worse - an endless barrage of increasingly implausible CG-rendered escapades, which again have nothing whatsoever to contribute to the story - given that in the book, the dwarfs never actually meet Smaug at all.What's particularly galling is that Jackson actually OMITS some of the best parts of the book. The arrival at Beorn's house, in the previous film, skips the clever introduction of the dwarfs, two at a time - a classic fairy-tale passage. The trek through the woods, which in the book extends to weeks of gloom, terror and privation, is reduced to a ridiculous, brilliantly-lit slug-fest with special-effects spiders.The endless interludes with Gandalf, Radagast and Sauron are well filmed, but obviously needless. It's like an extended product-placement: a trailer for the Lord of the Rings trilogy edited right into an unrelated story.I did like Stephen Fry's performance as the Master of Laketown, and I liked the image of Smaug. Aside from that, there's very little excuse for this film. It not only fails to capture the spirit - or even the major events - of the book, it's dead boring as a piece of cinema.I can understand Peter Jackson reaching for a big box of Tolkien Helper in order to extend these movies to such extreme length. But it might have been better if he'd waited till he ran out of actual Tolkien.(BTW: my apologies for the misspelling of 'dwarves' - IMDb keeps changing it.)",3,5,6,29 April 2014
Batman Begins," Competent... and utterly boring.
","This film has everything: the right director, the right cast, the right script. Everything but that spark of excitement, of comic-book madness that would actually make it all work. I've watched it through once, and tried repeatedly to watch it again. But each time, about five minutes is all I can stand before suddenly remembering why I disliked it.Tim Burton's Batman was goofy, ridiculous, revisionist. But Burton is a great director, and he made a great Batman movie. (Actually, 1.5 great movies.) Nolan is also a good director, but maybe he was being over-cautious here. This film takes no chances, pushes all the hot buttons, and fails miserably. Two hours of this and I begin to wonder why I've been a Batman fan for 40-odd years. Give me Adam West!Here are some of the things that I dislike about this film:* Spends endless time setting up the character, then uses him as a soulless puppet.* Burns down Wayne Mansion. (The Start Trek TNG movie syndrome: every movie, they just HAVE to destroy the Enterprise.)* Creates no chemistry between the hero and the girl...* ... played by the insufferable Katie Holmes.* Horrifically inappropriate casting of Michael Caine as Alfred.* Somehow pretends to be a 'darker' Batman, with no actual darkness.* The Bat-SUV. (Leaps tall buildings... oops, wrong movie.)* Ludicrous plotting, but without Burton's panache.* Christian Bale's totally expressionless Bruce Wayne. (And he looks even less like the comic character than Michael Keaton did.)* Ras al Ghul. (Surely, THE most ludicrous and uninteresting Batman villain.)* Morgan Freeman.I could go on, but none of this is the point. Batman Begins is a movie that's much less than the sum of its (theoretically excellent) parts. In fact, it's a movie that's much worse than the sum of its faults.",4,2,3,7 May 2007
Saving Private Ryan," Perposterous
","Spielberg is a highly competent director, who has a brilliant knack for making the right film at the right time. This has resulted in a number of his works being over-hyped to the point of the ridiculous.Saving Private Ryan is most certainly one of those films. Here we have a thin and totally implausible story, shallow characters, lack of historical authenticity... yet a reputation (confirmed on this board) of being 'the best war movie of all time.'Let me refute that view on just a couple of points.First, we should be clear that, while the opening D-Day sequence is certainly Spielberg at his best, it is by no means the best -- nor the first -- big-screen depiction of the realities of war. In fact, it's largely a rip-off of the equally good, and much earlier, beach-landing sequence in Cornel Wilde's 1967 tour-de-force, Beach Red. Spielberg modernizes the visuals very effectively, but does not improve on that earlier work, and in fact, echoes many specific sequences within it. (Wilde's film is also far more powerful in the rest of its story.)Second, aside from Private Ryan's many other weaknesses, I find most glaring it's unintentional irony. What country in WW II - other than the USA - could in its wildest dreams enjoy the luxury of bringing back one son merely because his siblings had died??? I can only imagine the jeers that must greet this idea when the film is shown in, say, Russia -- where tens of millions died, with no such convenient reprieves and nowhere to flee in any case. Or in England, where whole families had no choice but to soldier their way through the Blitz. The fact is, the soldiers of the USA were relatively unique in having a safe haven to return *to.* Saving Private Ryan not only manages to forget that fact, it somehow tries to make American troops seem the more heroic for it!I say the irony is unintentional... In fact, I long wondered if Spielberg had *meant* the story-line of Private Ryan ironically. But a recent interview on TCM convinces me that he did not. That's a shame. Done deliberately, this could have been a deliciously vitriolic statement on how the powers-that-be manipulate fighting men in the field. Instead, it's more like a slap in the face to the very men it attempts to honor. I have no idea how prevalent the 'Private Ryan' reprieve really was; but presenting it without context does a disservice to the entire force.On the positive side, there's no denying the production is well-mounted. I give the film 3 stars, chiefly for the technical brilliance of the opening sequence - and for the presence of the always-watchable Tom Hanks.",3,5,10,31 May 2008
I Am Legend," I Am NOT Legend
","This version of the classic book is certainly well-made. And Will Smith shines as never before, in a virtual solo performance. Unfortunately, in tossing out the original, brilliant ending of the book, the filmmakers have not only abandoned the entire justification for the exercise (not to mention for the title), they've failed to substitute any of their own. The resulting experience is not unlike watching a film called Tale of Two Cities that does NOT end with Sidney Carton doing a 'far, far better thing'... or a remake of Citizen Kane in which Rosebud unaccountably turns out to be Kane's chauffeur.The film is thus doubly disappointing. Not only does Hollywood cop out on Matheson's profound and widely-admired philosophical observation, it concocts a story that violates every precept of Drama 101. The initial two-thirds of the film presents Matheson's original character arc; the final one-third veers off wildly, and fails to pay off in any way on the lead-up. Conversely, nothing in the conclusion is properly foreshadowed, hence the ending can only seem arbitrary, contrived and unsatisfying. Yet another mindless Spielbergian Deus ex Machina.Thus, what could easily have been one of the truly great achievements in SF film ends up being merely a rather poor B movie -- slick, action-packed and momentarily diverting... yet ultimately hollow, bland and forgettable. I suspect it will be left to the Brits to make a proper version of I Am Legend one day; Hollywood has once again proved it hasn't the guts -- nor even the basic dramatic skills.",4,7,9,3 January 2008
Ex Machina," Beautifully made, but without much purpose
","The visual style of this film, the sparse dialog, the acting - all spell 'masterpiece.' The look of the artificial lifeform, and the performances of the three leads are spot-on. The unusual setting. It all works. Ex Machina is an arresting creation.Intellectually, also, the film tackles some very big questions. What is intelligence? Is our destiny to create our own successors? Should man play God?Unfortunately, that last question ends up dominating the story. And guess what: it's been done. To death. If you ask interesting questions, you need to come up with suitably interesting answers. Ex Machina does not. It thereby ends up being no more than a beautifully executed regurgitation of, yes, you guessed it, Mary Shelley's Frankenstein. Up until the last reel, it all seems off-beat and original. We're caught up in the fascinating trio of characters: the megalomaniacal computer genius, the young nerd, and the inscrutable AI. But instead of a clever pay-off, or any original statement whatsoever, the film nosedives into tired cliché. Instead of breadth of vision, it gives us only negativity and cheap shocks.Ultimately, Ex Machina is disappointing and massively unsatisfying, where it promises to be fresh and brilliant. It's worth seeing as an exercise in style, but it could have been so much more.",6,0,1,1 November 2015
Logan," Shallow, Tedious and Disappointing
","The high ratings for this film are based entirely on its sombre tone. That's a great novelty in a 'superhero' movie, to be sure. But it merely masks the film's emptiness - its painful lack of ideas, lack of character development, and total absence of plot.Jackman's performance? As someone once quipped, his emotional range runs the full gamut... from A to B. He looks grumpy and depressed in every scene. In every shot. Patrick Stewart is somewhat more nuanced, though he too is hamstrung by a script that gives his character the emotional depth of a cartoon. Dafne Keen does a great job as Laura, but her character has only attitude - which incompetent screen writers often mistake for character.Visually, the film is bland. I hear there's a black-and-white version. It's always a bad sign when a film's creators can't make up their minds on such a key issue. A film is either shot for B&W, or it isn't. (In the case of Logan, the photography lacks the dramatic contrasts and strong composition that might favor a noir-ish B&W presentation.)Logic holes abound:* After being raised in a cage, Laura turns out to be a competent driver. What's more, she has no trouble reaching the pedals, presumably on account of some stretching power that's not mentioned elsewhere in the film.* Laura is mute for half the film, for no apparent reason. Then she can only speak Spanish. Then fluent English. No explanation.* Laura is often feral, as you'd expect of someone raised in a cage by sadistic scientists. Yet she acts like a normal child most of the time. Ditto for her friends. This quality does not 'develop' as a result of events in the film - it simply materializes when needed.* Laura drives at random, ends up at a completely out-of-the-way building. And meets all her friends. When was this arranged? How did she learn navigation while locked in a cage?* Logan and Laura have a cozy evening with a nice family - knowing full well that they're setting them up for slaughter, when their pursuers come along. The audience knows this instantly, characters in the film don't quite get it.* Logan is dying, we're never told why. Professor X has a brain-cloud, or some such dread condition, also not explained.Missed opportunities are equally plentiful:* Laura's feral attacks are mentioned in conversation, but never really discussed. Logan dismisses them with a couple of heavy one-liners, when they could have (and should have) led to an extended rumination on violence. The film doesn't miss a beat when Laura's friends brutally murder the guy with the mechanical hand. This lynch-mob logic should, again, have been a starting point for reflections that never happen in this shallow, trivial film.* Logan never has a character arc. Wolverine actually has far less emotional range in this film than in the first X-Men movie. His relationship with Laura is essentially the same as the far more developed relationship with Rogue.* Characters are neither built up, nor revealed. To do that, you have to show them in a range of different circumstances, dealing with emotionally or morally challenging dilemmas. In Logan, the only dilemma is how to keep eluding inexorable pursuit so as to stretch the film out past the two-hour mark. Hence the only character trait that can be revealed is dogged perseverance. We get that in the first scene. After that, nothing.* Ultimately, the filmmakers resort to having Logan shaved back to his familiar Wolverine muttonchops. You know you're in trouble when you're counting on facial hair to create characterization. (Or fan service.)* Plot is nonexistent. The film is one long chase. Weak screenwriters often mistake this for plot, but it's a poor substitute: totally linear, predictable, boring. Yes, there have been great 'chase' films (Sam Peckinpah's The Getaway comes to mind.) They take care to incorporate twists and turns, and strong moments of characterization. Logan doesn't. It's just a bunch of stuff that happens.On top of everything else, I had the creeping suspicion that this film was calculated less as a standalone work, than as a stepping-stone for the X-Men 'franchise.' It disposes of two performers who've stated their intent to depart the roles they created. And it seems to pave the way for the endlessly-discussed New Mutants franchise. Ugh. Replacing the people won't make up for a lack of ideas, and Logan shows very clearly how bereft of creative thinking the X-Men cinematic franchise has become.I didn't hate Logan as I was watching it. But when it ended I was overcome by a feeling of emptiness and disappointment. This film lacks both entertainment value and deep ideas. The Marvel cinematic universe badly needs a shot of new blood, but sadly, this wasn't it.",4,67,148,26 May 2017
The Dark Knight," Not Exactly Citizen Kane
","The Dark Knight is a very good movie, and a very entertaining one. It's a film that leaves you feeling totally satisfied. But later, when you actually *think* about it, you may begin to wonder what you've actually seen.To be sure, the film has a number of major strengths. The sense of gritty realism is probably it's greatest asset. This is the superhero as a real-world phenomenon. The Batman of The Dark Knight is no more fantastic than, say, the James Bond of Casino Royale. (There's just one entirely needless bit of sci-fi - the whole thing with the cell-phone 'sonar' imaging. The film would be stronger without it.) Heath Ledger's performance is another big plus... though we shouldn't forget that Ledger is abetted by some very strong writing. It's a crowd-pleasing *part*, and we should be careful to spread the credit to all involved. I think Aaron Eckhart deserves mention as well; he's both likable and credible as the real square-jawed hero of the film.On the other hand, the film has some sizable (though not crippling) flaws.For starters, the story is relentlessly linear. In fact, there's barely a story at all. Nutjob Joker seeks to destroy crusading District Attorney Harvey Dent. That's about it. (Batman himself is almost incidental... which is not a bad thing.) Characterization is thin, to say the least. The Joker offers some hints at a back-story, but it's vague, self-contradictory and very, very limited. All the other roles are easily summed up in a single phrase. We've forgotten by now just why Bruce Wayne is so dedicated to fighting crime; it's taken for granted. And we never get much of a clue as to what makes Dent so fearlessly committed. Other characters simply go where the storyline demands. All this gives the film a breathless, streamlined velocity. But we need to admit that it ain't exactly Shakespeare... nor even Stan Lee.Scenically, the film is certainly impressive... especially if you see it in IMAX. (Although the constant shifts between IMAX and regular widescreen are a bit distracting.) One crucial visual element that really doesn't work, though, is Batman's costume. Despite an upgrade early in the film, it always seems stiff, cumbersome and unappealing. At one point, I was hauntingly reminded of Darth Vader. This Batman moves more like Iron Man than like Sam Raimi's spandex Spider-Man, or Ben Affleck's red-leather Daredevil.Finally, there's Christian Bale. He's much better here than in the dismal Batman Begins, and particularly good as the arrogant rich-boy Bruce Wayne. But he still doesn't bring much to the moderately important role of *Batman*. Physically, he gives off no feeling of strength; you never really believe he's a guy who could be punching it out with crowds of crooks every night. (Compare Daniel Craig in Casino Royale, or Matt Damon in the Bourne films; these guys have the Olympic physique a superhero would need.) When called upon to speak from behind the mask, Bale rasps unpleasantly, and his lips curl in a particularly ugly way. Admittedly, this Batman isn't intended to be *likable* (again, a good thing)... but a greater actor would have made him compellingly dark and brooding, rather than simply harsh and antisocial.All this may be nitpicking, but considering the hundreds of 10/10 ratings posted so far, I think a dose of reality is called for. The Dark Knight is an excellent film, no question... but not quite a work of diamond-like perfection. Let's appreciate it for what it is, rather than for what our enthusiasm would make it to be. Personally, I give it a solid 8/10, and reserve the perfect score for those perfect works of cinematic genius that do turn up every decade or so.",8,6,14,3 September 2008
Stalingrad," Excellent drama, a bit light on the history
","It's hard to deny this is an excellent film. Impeccable acting, direction and photography create a powerful depiction of war at its most miserable, futile and degrading.But I do think two mild criticisms need to be stated.First, a movie titled 'Stalingrad' ought to present at least some vague overview of that historical battle. Aside from a few confusing references to the wider tactical situation, this move sticks to a worms-eye view. After a while, you even have to wonder whether the travails of this particular group of soldiers are at all typical of the huge German force involved at the time. The film works as drama, but if you call it simply 'Stalingrad,' I think you're promising a bit of historical context.Second, the pace is a tiny bit over-drawn. In the last third of the film, I reached an atrocity overload, where further horrors had progressively less impact. I began to disconnect from the characters, remaining only mildly curious as to what agonizingly tragic ways would be found to dispatch them. A stronger dramatic hook is needed, to pull us through the admitted hopelessness of this last segment.These are far from fatal flaws. It's more a question of balance. A bit more context, a slightly tighter narrative, and this could have been a masterpiece. As it is, I'd say it's a really excellent film, that does show - unforgettably - how war deadens the soul, even if it fails to kill the body.Still, I have to hope that other filmmakers will one day present a broader view of the battle of Stalingrad. There's still lots of historical ground that needs to be covered, if future generations are to understand the madness that created this nightmarish conflict.",8,0,0,6 August 2013
Arrival," Good Film, but Wastes the Original Material
","After 1400-odd reviews, I'm sure this has been said before, but I have to add my voice to the chorus. Arrival is a nice little SF thriller, well-filmed, nicely acted and brimming with atmosphere. But as an adaptation of the original short story upon which it was based, Ted Chiang's 'The Story of Your Life,' it's an utter travesty.(I won't reveal much about either the film or the story, but there are some generalities that are worth stating.)Villeneuve is a director whose work I've enjoyed and admired. And I can appreciate that there must have been enormous pressure to create a marketable film. Profit figures indicate that Villeneuve succeeded, by crafting a moody, modernized take on 'The Day the Earth Stood Still.' It's all a bit over-familiar, but well executed, and enlivened by beautiful digital imagery.Unfortunately, financial success was achieved by throwing away absolutely everything that's truly worthwhile about the original story. I won't give away much, other than to point out that the change in titles tells it all. The short story is subjective, and it's not about the effect that alien Arrival has on Earth's politics or culture. It's about the aliens' effect, and particularly the effect of their language, on one person. And it's told very much from the point of view of that one person.I enjoyed Arrival, but I was also massively disappointed that Villeneuve failed to deliver the movingly existential gem I was expecting, and which as a director he was amply capable of creating. If you haven't seen the film, I strongly recommend you read the story first. It's by far the greater of the two works, and deserves to be experienced without preconceptions.",7,2,6,5 March 2017
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," Interesting Experiment
","Worth seeing for movie fans, but mainly for the technique, not the content.Inarritu pulls out all the stops, shooting in almost one seamless take. (Spotting the cuts is about half the fun - unfortunately.) Cinematically, the film is arresting, almost breathtaking. But only barely entertaining.The acting is superb, throughout. Micheal Keaton is excellent as usual, though I'm not sure this is his best performance ever. (He was at least as good as the charismatic psycho in Desperate Measures, for just one example.) It's a shame he was passed over for the Oscar, he's one of the best actors in Hollywood, and probably overlooked mainly because he's associated with comedy rather than drama (though he's done both superbly).The problem, as others have pointed out, is that Birdman just doesn't add up to much. (MILD spoilers, nothing to agonize over, especially in this largely 'plotless' film...)Keaton is frantic, insecure, vainly trying to take his career where it probably doesn't deserve to go. But you get that in the first five minutes. After that, you have to grab your pleasures where you can. For example, the underwear scene is fun, but it works as little more than an aside. Its strong reception from the Broadway audience doesn't seem to greatly affect Keaton's approach to his play. The sub-plot concerning Keaton's daughter is similarly wasted, as is the beautifully ambiguous performance by Ed Norton as Keaton's bombastic co-star - a character who totally dominates the first half of the film only to go strangely missing in the last act.The pay-off for all this is minimal. What does the ending mean? Bottom line, not much. All the technique lavished on this threadbare story can't replace the substance that's just not there.Birdman reminded me of Black Swan, another bit of overblown Oscar-bait that offered great technique and lots of angst in lieu of saying anything particularly novel or interesting about the theatrical life. Birdman is a much better film, and a far more entertaining one, but still not exactly a must-see.",6,0,3,9 March 2015
Wonder Woman," Above average, but no more
","And that's only because the average has gotten so dreadfully low. Wonder Woman is a largely by-the-numbers film. In fact, it's almost entirely a remake of the 2009 animated film of the same name (which also was 'above average' - for a children's cartoon).What works:* Gal Gadot is not a great actress (so far), but she is physically perfect for the part, and, aided by competent direction, she becomes a very satisfying Wonder Woman.* The World War I setting is novel, and allows a grittier texture than we're seeing in most superhero films. (It's the chief element that's been added, compared to the animated version.)* Wonder Woman's action scenes are beautifully filmed, perfectly capturing that iconic quality that every superhero needs.What doesn't:* The story is rather thin, and largely a rehash of the (much better) first Captain America film, albeit set 30 years earlier.* (SPOILER) I guessed the big villain reveal the instant his 'secret identity' character came on-screen. Note to writers: trying to surprise the audience by means of a tired cliché is kind of futile. Much smarter would have been to let us in on the twist right from the start, so we could follow the Machiavellian politics. There's a huge untapped irony in having the chief proponent of peace actually be the strongest supporter of endless war. (END SPOILER)* The biggest disappointment, and the biggest missed opportunity, is the presentation of World War I. Arriving on Themiscyra, Trevor introduces the Germans as 'the bad guys,' setting the trivial tone. It may be fair enough to demonize Hitler and his Nazis, but it's not so easy to muster blind hatred for Kaiser Wilhelm II, a rather typical monarchist leader who most of us know nothing about. Later in the film the point is made that 'all sides are at fault for making war.' But it is never acknowledged that The Great War was the perfect illustration of that truth. This was an opportunity for the film to put down real emotional and philosophical roots. Instead, by shying away from the historical reality, it deliberately remains superficial and uninvolving.In summary: the scenes of Wonder Woman in action are great - but they're offset by a lack of depth in the characters, a lack of depth in the historical setting, and a typically over-long DC climactic battle with the villain.The people creating these comic book films need to realize that the rules of drama apply to them too. The most exciting action, the most colorful heroes, all fall flat without a strong dramatic foundation. Either make the film a bit longer, or make the big battle a bit shorter - and put that time towards building some real empathy for the *people*, some real depth to their setting.Wonder Woman is certainly the best of the recent DC films, but only because it shares their failings to a lesser degree. I grew up loving comics, especially superhero comics. I've seen the good, the bad and the unbelievably lame - originally for 10 cents. With hundred-million dollar budgets at its disposal, Hollywood can and should be doing a lot better.",7,0,4,29 September 2017
The Dark Knight Rises," Rubbish
","It's amazing how many positive reviews of this film are essentially just making excuses for it. Unfortunately, the flaws are literally inexcusable. This is yet another entry in that endless line of large-scale action films that just don't add up dramatically.It's not hard to understand how people have been misled. This is a sequel to a great film. And it certainly *looks* great, thanks to a massive budget and Christopher Nolan's unique directorial touch. It's got spectacular action, larger-than-life villains, cool gadgetry and some solid supporting performances. But it's got no logic at all, starting from about the halfway point.So all the film's very significant assets are wasted, for lack of an extra couple of hours at the keyboard. Why does Bane want to take over Gotham? Why wait six months?? How does Bruce Wayne recover from having 'no cartilage anywhere in his body' *and* a serious spinal injury, spend months in a dungeon, and find himself in shape to perform like a circus acrobat?? (This guy is supposed to be human, remember. That's the whole attraction of the Batman character.) Nothing really connects dramatically, either. Alfred makes a contrived exit, for no reason other than to add some semblance of emotion. Catwoman exhibits almost no personality, and reverses herself so often it gets monotonous.There's even a rather ugly subtext, suggesting that anyone protesting against income inequality and obscene misconduct on Wall Street is probably an anarchist and a terrorist. (And possibly a super-villain, to boot.) The right or wrong of this insinuation is irrelevant. It simply belongs in a different movie, one that's willing and able to deal with important and complex issues. Dark Knight Rises slips it in subliminally, and never deals with it (or anything else) in any depth.On top of all this, we have a most unwelcome reappearance by the idiotic Ra's Al Ghul, as well as a painfully arbitrary and meaningless plot twist near the end.Plus, of course, a surpassingly dismal performance from Christian Bale, which makes all his previous dreary output look Oscar-worthy by comparison. When will people notice that this guy *cannot* act? He makes faces and modulates his tone of voice almost like an actual actor, but there's never anybody home behind the facade. And whatever is the opposite of charisma, he has it in vast quantities. Batman should be an imposing figure, a tragic presence, an anguished soul... Bale has no soul, and the anguish lies in watching him attempting to conceal this lack by over-acting for two and a half hours.All in all, this film does a good job of killing the Batman franchise - for a while, at least. Let's hope the reins pass to someone with a clearer vision than Nolan. Someone who can do for Batman what Sam Raimi did for Spider-Man: discover the *man* inside the suit. All the gadgets and CG effects in the world won't do it. It needs better writing.",2,4,14,12 December 2012
The Deer Hunter," Long, pretentious and incredibly feeble
","Deer Hunter has the lowest content-per-minute of any film I can recall. It's like listening to the dial tone after your caller has hung up - only not as exciting. Is the film saying something incredibly deep? No. It's just s-a-y-i-n-g i-t r-e-a-l-l-y s-l-o-w-l-y. It has little if anything to say about Vietnam, and pathetically little to say about human psychology in general. It's just endless and empty.About the only decent bit is the Russian roulette sequence. Yes, this is indeed gripping... or, at least, it could have been, within a less bloated package. As it is, it only seems to add insult to injury - as if to say, THIS is how interesting your three hours COULD have been, IF we could have been bothered to come up with an actual story, not to mention the discipline to tell it economically.In a way, the Russian roulette metaphor IS appropriate. Because someone would have to hold a gun to my head before I'd ever watch this bilge again.",1,34,65,7 January 2010
300," A significant work of art
","A work of art must be judged in its own terms. It's fine to say: '300 was not my cup of tea.' Certainly! Many people will find it too violent, too loud, too long, too intense, too dark... But to criticize it 'objectively' for, say, not being historically accurate, or for not having deep characters, is to entirely miss what the movie is about. As absurd as criticizing 2001: A Space Odyssey for not being Citizen Kane. Or Lord of the Rings for having 'too many elves.' (Bravo, Richard Roeper!) Or the Mona Lisa for not having a denser plot...300 is a visually-powerful allegory. It's a simple, visceral experience, with a simple, eternal message. (You can't conquer someone who has conquered fear.) Why look for anything else? This is a movie that dares to be simple, primal, focused. A film that revels in its excesses. And one that succeeds brilliantly at what it tries to do.There are many pleasures along the way. The dynamic chiaroscuro observation of characters' features. The play of forms and colors, stripped of their three-dimensional, real-world complexities, reduced to vivid bas-relief. The terse dialog, filled with ironic resonance. Powerful, suitably stylized performances that work synergistically with the extreme visuals, rather than being obscured by them.Is 300 'realistic'? Of course not! But is it a valid reflection of reality? A distillation of certain very basic truths? An aesthetically pleasing crystallization of archetypal images? Most definitely. Is it a much-needed reminder of something we've all forgotten? Alas, yes. That at some times, in some places (or was it only in fantasy?), men have chosen NOT to submit to tyranny, even when submission seemed like the only 'reasonable' choice. That there IS a higher ideal than today's pragmatic 'take the money and run.'Oddly enough, this feels like art that an ancient Greek, transported to the 21st Century, might find both familiar and admirable. In short, a grand and glorious film.",9,3,8,31 March 2007
The Great Escape," Great film, but read the book too...
","The Great Escape is one of the great action films of all time. The rousing martial score by Elmer Bernstein, the perfect cast of stars and stalwart supporting actors, the literate script by James Clavell, the taut direction by John Sturges... it all works together to create a seamless cinematic experience. However, it's well worth considering the realities underlying the fiction, because they can only deepen our appreciation for both. Some aspects of the film that seem improbable are easily explained; other aspects that are glossed over in the film reveal surprising additional depths.1. First, as others have pointed out, the details of the prisoners' shenanigans and of the escape -- especially the most unbelievable ones -- are absolutely true. German POW camps, largely as a result of the Geneva Convention, were a sort of world apart, with rules slanted surprisingly in favor of the prisoners. Many of their most outrageous escapades are actually omitted in the film.2. Subtly missing on screen is a sense of what camp life was really like on a day to day basis. There's no room in this fast-paced film to represent the dreadful tedium of years spent in the same wooden shack, on short rations. Years with no hope of parole, since the prisoners didn't know, as we now do, when the war might end. This helps explain their nigh-suicidal devotion to escape; these were men of action, cooped up endlessly with absolutely nothing else to do but plot to outwit their jailors.3. Also missing is a clear image of relations between prisoners and guards. By March, 1944, the Germans were living on very tight rations -- boiled potatoes and cabbage sort of stuff. Whereas the prisoners, while not exactly fat and happy, were receiving Red Cross goodies that no one in Germany had even dared dream about for years. This is hinted at, in the bribery that James Garner is able to conduct. But the dispirited state of mind of the Germans is not shown in any depth. According to multiple accounts, many guards were all too happy to collaborate with the prisoners, based on sheer economic pressure.4. On the other hand, it's not made clear just what the prisoners were up against. It's easy to get the impression that this was some sort of Hogan's Heroes resort, with the Germans oblivious to obvious conspiracies. Hardly! The 'ferrets' were guards who had the free run of the camp. They could literally pop in on any prisoner activity, at any time, any place. We see this happening once or twice in the film, but the implications aren't fully suggested. These were men with zero privacy; everything they did was subject to continuous scrutiny.5. The most obvious distortion, of course, is inclusion of Americans as major players in the escape. This was mainly a British camp and the Great Escape is fundamentally a British story. In fact, Richard Attenborough's character is the only one readily identifiable as a real person -- the amazing Roger Bushell. There's no point getting hung up on this bit of creative license; Sturges and Clavell have done a brilliant job of streamlining the story and spicing it up with star power. But in appreciating this film, we should realize which is reality and which is clever fiction.6. Finally, a word on the retribution meted out by the Germans. Yes, their treatment of the recaptured escapees was an atrocity. In fact, not mentioned in the film, it's been alleged that the order came directly from Hitler himself. On the other hand, what is not mentioned is that prior to the Great Escape prisoners had been repeatedly warned that breakouts were no longer going to be treated leniently. This is an important point. It makes the prisoners' actions even more heroic -- and also makes the Germans' apparent over-reaction more understandable (if not forgivable).What's more, even within the logic of the film, it has to be understood that these POWs really did cross the line from escapee to spy. Big X specifically says that his purpose is to set up a whole 'second front.' By intent, therefore, this is not a mere escape; it's a calculated attempt to disrupt the German war machine, conducted by men out of uniform. That's more or less the dictionary definition of espionage, for which summary execution has long been the standard remedy. (Steve McQueen flashes his officer's bars at the end, emphasizing the point. It's a moment that I didn't understand at all the first few times I saw the film.)None of this in any way excuses the insane brutality of war -- but it does make the events depicted in this great film somewhat more comprehensible. History is more fascinating than fiction exactly because of its greater depth. The upshot being that anyone who's enjoyed the film really should seek out the book by Paul Brickhill. Not to mention other books covering the same story, such as Alan Burgess' excellent The Longest Tunnel. There's a lot more to this true story than can fit in any one film, even one as beautifully constructed as The Great Escape.",10,3,6,8 October 2008
John Wick: Chapter 2," Lame and Empty
","I really wanted to like this movie. I expected to like it. I actually did like a lot of things about it. But overall, I found it unimaginative, lifeless and boring. 'Non-stop action' is simply not very exciting without a proper dramatic underpinning.The framework is great. The mysterious criminal organization, the neutral zones where no combat is allowed, the gold coins that magically buy just about anything, the marker that forces Wick out of retirement (again), the Italian suit with a Kevlar lining... and, of course, Wick himself, the stone-faced, unkillable James Bond of the underworld.And there are a few great scenes: the terse conversations between Wick and Ian McShane (who is always a pleasure to watch); the sepulchral confrontation between Wick and the lady mobster; Laurence Fishburn chewing up the scenery and clearly having a ball...So much for about 15 minutes of the movie. The rest is incredibly tedious action, action, action. Action with no point, very little style and absolutely zero creativity.The settings do vary, to be sure: a rock concert in an Italian ruin; dusty catacombs; a subway station and subway train; a highly improbable house-of-mirrors museum exhibit... But the action itself is both mindless and unforgivably repetitive. I started ticking off a handful of standard moves: Wick dropping to the floor; Wick grabbing an attacker's arm and using it to shoot another attacker; Wick somersaulting through a hail of bullets and then unerringly pegging an entire wave of attackers...It IS possible to do a pure action-ballet type of movie - in the Hong Kong, John Woo mode - but the action has to be really, really GOOD. In Wick 2, the action is well-staged, but appallingly choreographed. It's also not rooted in any actual drama, so after a while it's very hard to care about yet another butchered bad guy.Even the film's opening sequence is all wrong - about ten minutes of pure action with absolutely no dramatic justification. Classic car chases are rooted in characterization: The French Connection, Bullit, The Seven-Ups... What's the point of watching vehicles crash into each other before we even know who's driving them, or why?Keanu Reaves and the supporting cast are all good. The camera work is fine. But there's no actual movie here. Recommendation: find something else to do with your two hours.",5,5,11,10 June 2017
Donnie Darko," Ambitious, Interesting... and Utterly Insubstantial
","This movie contains a lot of interesting stuff, without actually being interesting in itself. It's a confused collection of often-clever scenes, but no kind of masterpiece taken as a whole. True, the 'asides' are frequently entertaining... discussions of literature, weird confrontations that don't play out the way you expect, nice bits of characterization... (Bizarrely, I found Drew Barrymore's character the most interesting and likable.) And, in fairness, the acting is uniformly good.But overall, the movie just doesn't add up to anything. The ending is a kind of Twilight Zone cop-out - trite if you take it literally, offensively meaningless otherwise. Is Donnie nuts, or is he not? By the end, who cares? The schizoid behavior becomes almost random after a while. The giant rabbit starts out sinister, then becomes laughable through repetition, eventually ends up just plain uninteresting.This sort of material can work, but it's not enough to just be weird for weirdness' sake. If you want to be surreal on a story level, you really should have something to say on a philosophical level. This movie has nothing on either level. You get the strong suspicion its creators couldn't quite think of a brilliant statement to make, so they just muddied the waters in the hopes that the audience would read in some brilliance on its own.Sorry: 'murky' is NOT the same as 'deep' (except to those who really don't GET 'deep.') And 'artsy' is NOT the same as 'artistic.' By all means, see this film if you're curious and have time to waste - but otherwise, don't feel you've missed anything important.",4,4,8,20 June 2010
