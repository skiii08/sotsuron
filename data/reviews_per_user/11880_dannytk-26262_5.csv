Hereditary," Terrible
","This movie was sooooo bad! I was laughing throughout at how Un-scary it was, I mean wtf?! This movie was so far from scary it's sad! Horror movies are dead in the water, and this just proved it! One of the most over hyped horror movies in a while and it was just awful! This should have been a comedy!",1,2,6,24 August 2018
Ready Player One," Bravo Spielberg!
","What a ride, what a movie! Graphics where crazy, especially at the shining scene, great music, great story, just couldn't stop smiling at the nostalgic pop culture in this movie, took me back to my childhood with the BTTF nods, loved seeing the deLorean tearing up the racetrack! Just what the doctor ordered from Spielberg. Another instant hit!",10,0,2,5 April 2018
Avengers: Endgame," Awesome ending to this phase!
","I loved this movie, the only reason I gave it a 9 is because I preferred infinity war.The story was great, and the battle at the end was sensational! 'Avengers....ASSEMBLE!'My only negatives were that I didn't like Professor Hulk or fat Thor! Other than that, it was phenomenal and I can't wait to see it again!",9,0,2,26 April 2019
Avengers: Infinity War," Best movie ever!
","This is easily my favourite film of all time, not one negative! I'm a huge fan of the marvel universe but this is different level! So much so, I thought it was better than endgame!",10,1,2,26 April 2019
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Awful, worst QT movie I've seen.
","The only reason I gave this movie a 3 star is because brad Pitt was the only good thing about it, his character was cool and funny. The rest of the movie just draggggged along and all it was doing was showing us the typical QT camera skills. This movie seriously lacked the Tarantino charisma and flair! I wouldn't watch it again!",3,1,4,20 August 2019
