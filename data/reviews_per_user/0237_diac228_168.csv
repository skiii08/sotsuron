The Rock," With enough energy to generate an entire city, The Rock will absolutely blow you back into the 90s.
","The 90s was home to a slew of great raw, uncut, action flicks that shot straight for the rated 'R,' despite the guarantee that it would make less money than the money-friendly PG-13 rating. While Die Hard and Lethal Weapon may have jump-started this craze, the peak of this was during the next decade, when we saw the likes of Terminator 2, Speed, Face-Off, Con Air, Die Hard: With a Vengeance, The Matrix, Bad Boys, Point Break, Under Siege, True Lies, Desperado, among others (Quite a list I accumulated, eh?). The 90s was certainly a good decade for action fans, but few movies of this genre can quite top the powerful, gripping, and edge-of-your seat action blockbuster The Rock. The name alone sounds powerful, and behind it is two hours of incredible special effects, superb acting, great action set pieces, and good dosage of writing, and Michael Bay on top of his game.Few action movies carries as much morality and questionable circumstances as this one. In The Rock we follow a furious general (Ed Harris) leading a group of Marines to take control of Alcatraz Island (along with tourist hostages), a location that used to house criminals. Accompanying them are over a dozen missiles that can spell tens of thousands of innocent lives with every blast. However, he isn't just a trigger-happy man gone crazy, he is a man seeking justice for the dozens of lives he saw taken from warfare without compensation. A villain with a 'moral' agenda, yikes. The only hope for the United States is the only man that has ever broken out of that prison (Sean Connery) and a chemical 'superfreak' (Nicholas Cage). With the odds obviously against them, the Pentagon is one order away from destroying the entire location regardless of the innocent lives located in the island. Mindless this movie is not, as the stakes are high, there is always a risk of an innocent life going under, and our heroes rarely ever have the scenario under control. It's just enough to make you squeal in frustration.With the tension remaining edgy and the solution never being oh-so-close, we can thank the writers for delivering a slam-bang storyline full of great one-liners, likable characters, and a villain that isn't as simple to figure out as the average evildoer. The writing staff ranges from the writer of the third Die Hard to even Tarantino. A major reason for the film's quality is the casting. Sean Connery and Ed Harris are excellent in their roles and Nicholas Cage albeit a few lines does a good job. The supporting staff helps as well, as we see the likes of David Morse, John Spencer, and Cage's love interest Vanessa Marcil.Unlike Michael Bay's latest films, which run from mediocre to just plain bad, he blends plenty of drama and suspense along with action here. As a matter of fact, the first half of the movie is all suspense, as the situation is developed, and the risks are presented. Disregarding a superb car chase, there isn't much exploding in the first 80 minutes. However, once the protagonists enter the Rock, it all goes on the uphill action swing. We get brutal fights, brutal shootouts, near-misses, double-crosses, triple-crosses, chases, and enough explosions for action fans to sink their teeth into. The funny thing, the two main actors at the time weren't expected to be in such action. Connery was aging, and Nicholas Cage just didn't have the look or the attitude for it. Fortunately for us, they proved us dead wrong.Bottom Line: If you want to see a true action classic, The Rock is a great example. Rising above the average action movie and above the decent ones as well, this is by far Michael Bay's best work and one of the signature flicks of the 90s. Combining tension you can cut with a steak knife with thrills, chills, and plenty of carnage, The Rock has aged well and continues to influence the work of modern action movies and the work of Michael Bay as well. Grab some popcorn and enjoy this ruthlessly clever movie. Recommend to the max, as long as you don't mind a bit of blood spewing onto the screen. They just don't make em' like they used to.",9,78,83,11 July 2008
The Avengers," Cinematic comic book joyride
","We waited a long time for this movie. An extremely long time. After years of waiting (Have I emphasized the waiting part yet?), years of hits (Iron Man, Thor), misses (The Incredible Hulk) and disappointments (Iron Man 2) we get the long-awaited reunion of all of the (accessible to Disney) Marvel heroes that eventually form the league of heroes known as the Avengers. This film is blockbuster fanfare at its finest, as this will please the newbie new-school Marvel fans as well as your hardcore old-schoolers.The Avengers' plot is very straightforward, very simple. Loki (you know him from Thor) has arrived in the United States and steals this ultra-powerful sphere to attempt to take over the entire planet. Your classic comic book tale. Nick Fury attempts to unite several of the well-known superheroes that had remained under the watch of SHIELD over the years in order to bring Loki to intergalactic justice. It's a good ol' good vs. evil plot that paces like a comic book in terms of withholding the juicy content until the final act.What makes this movie work is the superb script that is full of one-liners, full of complex interactions between our heroes that all come from very different backgrounds, and contains more than enough room to allow for action and mayhem to conquer the screen. Joss Whedon's style can clearly be heard through the dialogue, and his rabid cult following (which is the strongest in media aside from Tarantino) will devour every moment of it.What also makes this movie work is the phenomenal amount of action that you'll see from the beginning to the end. Plenty of fights, plenty of carnage, plenty of heroes working together, and best of all they make up for the recent Marvel movies that had been sorely lacking in material. Every hero has their moment to shine, from the fan favorite Iron Man to even the weaker Hawkeye. And Hulk gets to smash, a lot, and boy does he deliver in ways you wouldn't expect. An added bonus is that our heroes despite having flaws and limitations are definitely likable enough for you to root for them—even the Hulk, who had been extremely poorly characterized over the yea-decades in media. You have the great acting ensemble to thank for that.But....The Avengers is a great movie, don't get me wrong, it will be worth your pennies. But, you can tell they were quite limited.Part of the appeal of The Avengers comic books were the cameo surprises and supervillians as well as the heroes. Instead, we have a villain that already was featured in a prior movie as well as nameless faceless boring baddies. And no cameos. One can only imagine if Disney actually pushed for the ability to bring in the Marvel characters already owned by other movie companies. Then, the potential will explode and reach levels of awesomeness that we see only in the comic books.And for those of you that tell me movie companies working together is not possible, I bring Exhibit A: Who Framed Roger Rabbit---A Disney movie.If we ever were to see The Avengers reach its full potential, we need to see Hollywood work together and be willing to bend a few rules. Until then, we get this: a great fun movie (and potentially great franchise) marred by its limited resources.",8,2,6,4 May 2012
Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Review of Kill Bill Vol. 1 and 2
","One of the most acclaimed movies this decade is Kill Bill, Volumes 1 and 2. Both movies made over 60 million dollars each in the United States (over 330 million dollars worldwide in total) and has gotten so much praise one would wonder why is it that this doesn't have its own star in the Hollywood Walk of Fame yet. Directed by the unique and creative Quentin Tarantino, Kill Bill mixes bloody gory violence with a lot of beautiful imagery, excellent music, and a well-rounded cast of zany characters. Sounds great doesn't it? Well, Kill Bill Vol. 1 is a very good movie, but it is not as good as people say it is. As for Kill Bill Volume 2, now that is a spectacular movie. These two movies in actuality is one film, but for marketing purposes and because the finished product is so long, Miramax decides to release it as two separate films. Despite the rather slow start, Kill Bill finishes so strong you know why Tarantino is as popular as he is today.Kill Bill is about a woman, whose name is not revealed throughout most of the film (known as The Bride), looking for revenge after the gang of assassins she used to be with attacked her during a wedding rehearsal, killing every single person except for her. But before she goes after the man that started the massacre, she wants to get rid of the four people that were involved in the bloodbath first. Much easier said than done. The first Kill Bill basically is like an action flick, not concentrated too heavily on plot, but more on action. Kill Bill Vol. 2 does contain its amount of intense action, but also sinks deeper into the personalities of not just The Bride, but of the assassins, and Bill himself.The first part of Kill Bill is advertised as a massive action flick full of intense sequences of sword fighting and action. The truth is, there is only two massive action scenes, and both are good, don't get me wrong, but there is a lot of fluff in between the two action scenes. They range from several scenes of chatter, to an anime sequence, to a long sequence of The Bride trying to wiggle her toes. Talk about slow-paced. To add to that, it took 10-20 minutes before the final fight was finally set up. In other words, she was at the scene of the major fight, yet it took forever for the fight to begin. This first part of the movie would be much shorter if it was Robert Rodriguez editing the film.Tarantino also does this one-take shot that just can turn a potentially short moment into a very stretched and prolonged scene. And this happens twice. The movie is good, there is a good storyline, two jaw-dropping action scenes, good cast of characters(I fell in love with Gogo Yubari, and also the top assassin Elle Driver) and a shocking twist in the end, but overall I find Kill Bill Vol. 1 rather overrated. If there is one thing I love about the first part though, it has got to be the music, especially the credits theme and also the now famous theme to the hotel where the final battle takes place. Now enter part 2.Kill Bill Vol. 2 is everything Vol. 1 wanted to be. Volume 2 perfectly mixes suspense with action, humor, excellent music, brilliant acting, and a very good ending. Volume 2 basically fills all the holes Volume 1 created, and also answers all of the questions as to why the events took place and how The Bride became so skillful. Volume 2 concludes the entire ordeal, as the Bride has to deal with Budd, Elle, and of course, Bill, but gets a little more than what she bargained for. Elle Driver makes an even longer appearance the second time around, and Daryl Hannah (well-known as the mermaid in Splash) gives the best performance of the movie, as she portrays the ruthless, clever, unpredictable, and rage-filled rival assassin of The Bride. Her battle against the Bride stands in my opinion as one of the best fights within the past 10 years.The second half of the movie also has several flashbacks that helps weave the story together, and the flashback themselves were very entertaining and offered its share of foreshadowing. This was the pure filming brilliance that I was expecting from Tarantino. Very few flaws in the movie, and there never was a sense that the movie was dragging too long, and it is clocked in at over 10 minutes longer than the original, but it did not feel that way. There is not much more to say about the second part, except for the fact that it really picked up the slack and delivers one of the best movie experiences this decade. Kill Bill overall is a great film, overrated, but a superb film nonetheless. Not the best I have seen this decade, but has an entertainment value that is much higher than the usual films within the past few years. Kill Bill: packs a violent punch, a truly entertaining roller coaster.Kill Bill Vol. 1 = 7/10 Kill Bill Vol. 2 = 10/10 Kill Bill overall = 8/10",10,0,1,28 October 2005
Vertigo," Great mystery. Irritating conclusion. Wait its still going...
","Usually, I don't comment much on older movies, as people are less likely to read what it is I have to say. But, this is an exception as an unemployed bitter critic goes up against a film considered amongst the best of all-time. What was a slightly panned movie at first, Vertigo eventually established itself as one of the top masterpiece films from Hitchcock and one of the greatest movies ever. Here is where the praise ends. Vertigo is two parts excellent, and one part draggy. What started out as a spellbinding mystery with few clues as to where it's going, transported into a frustrating psychological thriller that took way too long to conclude. Alfred Hitchcock is a master director, but the script revealed all its trick cards much too soon, leaving us with nothing more than an ace of spades in the third act.Vertigo is a film that works in two layers: there are two conflicts presented. The first two acts involve the main conflict, the main mystery, and the final act involves the consequences and results of the original mystery. John Ferguson (James Stewart) develops a fear of heights after a terrible accident while chasing a suspect on the rooftops. After the accident, he agrees to snoop after the wife (Kim Novak) of an old college friend in order to occupy his time after retiring from the police force. What follows is a twisted path full of deceits, lies, murder, and surprises. And this is just two-thirds of the movie. Based off of a French novel 'The Living and the Dead,' Vertigo's spellbinding screenplay is written by Samuel A. Taylor.The intrigue of this film is the sheer confusing mystery and descriptive imagery that offered light clues. It wasn't the typical mystery, as you didn't quite know who to trust and who to believe. James Stewart does a fantastic job portraying the bored ex-detective constantly trying to overcome his devastating fear. The lead female, Kim Novak, also does a great job, despite being twice as young as the male lead. Besides them, there aren't a lot of major roles, but all the supporting cast did a respectable job.With mysteries of this magnitude, you need a master of suspense to keep the audience riveted. Alfred Hitchcock is one of the best directors of all-time, and is the main reason why Vertigo stays afloat. He times his shots perfectly; he always starts the films off with a bang, and does a great job maintaining the suspense, even long after the main flaw of the flick is revealed. My favorite trait of Hitchcock is how he paces the story well and never over-does the shots---unlike your Stanley Kubrick and his followers. His only minor flaw is his rushing towards the endings, which includes this one. Nonetheless, he expands his horizons a bit by delivering some nice animated sequences and delightful visual clues.The griping begins here. The acting, writing, directing, music, and pacing works perfectly fine---until the third act. Mysteries run like a magical act, you should never ever reveal the secret until after the trick is performed, that is if you choose to. In the case of Vertigo however, the twist is revealed to the audience in between the second and third act, still leaving a hefty dose of story to tell. The main appeal of Vertigo is gone: the intrigue, the mystery has disappeared. The problem has been solved to a major extent, but we still are not seeing the credits. Not sure where the blame should be placed, but I'll hand it to the writer, which spilled the beans far too soon.Films can run on multiple genres sometimes (District 9 being a recent successful example), but when the first part is mystery, it's a lot tougher to pull off a wholesome successful film. I found myself on the edge during the first hour and a half, but utterly distraught in the final half hour. The funny thing is the only thing that had to change was the trump card revelation. If they had moved the revelation just twenty minutes further, it would have helped Vertigo a whole lot. But, the early reviews were correct, the last third of the flick bogged down the overall movie.Bottom Line: Alfred Hitchcock does his best to salvage a script that turned off the smokescreen far too soon. His directing remains inches below perfection, as he directs a great acting cast, grand musical score, and clever mystery. But, once the mystery is gone, so is the quality and interest. Vertigo is a good film, but in my eyes misses the mark slightly because of the editing/writing issue I have discussed throughout this review. Despite what your usual film major and film critics say, this isn't among Hitchcock's best, and this isn't one of the best films of all-time. There are superior mysteries and surprise twists past and present. Just imagine what would have happened if the surprises of The Usual Suspects, Fight Club, and The Sixth Sense had been revealed sooner? Those movies would have been extremely different in terms of theming, pacing and quality.",7,0,3,20 July 2010
Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," Frustratingly Entertaining
","Law and Order: Special Victims Unit is one of my favorite television shows, even though its gone a bit downhill lately. Is it the cast? No, because they are mostly intact. What is actually happening is that each of the main characters, known for their superb chemistry amongst each other, are suddenly spending less screen time with each other and more time to themselves. This story actually has a point. On Stranger Tides suffers the same fate: fantastic cast that don't spend as much time with each other as we hope. Add some pointless plot lines, a calmer first-third of the flick, and you have yourself the fourth installment of Pirates of the Caribbean.That being said, its still quite entertaining. On Stranger Tides follows a variety of people searching for the fabled Fountain of Youth. Unfortunately for us, its not just Jack Sparrow. We have Blackbeard, the Spanish, the British (led by Barbossa), Angelica, and more doing the same thing. Subplots pertaining to this quest include Jack's past with Angelica, Barbossa's questionable change in character, some random guy falling for some random girl (I am serious, this part was totally pointless), and the pointless Spanish people that flock in and out of the movie.This is by far the weakest part of the movie, the script. For some odd reason, they borrowed far too much from the novel (whose pacing and themes far differ that of the Pirates brand) and forgot that sometimes simplicity is best---which is what made Curse of the Black Pearl such a great film. It was the easiest to follow, and On Stranger Tides didn't learn from the previous two installments. To add to that, the script utterly separated everyone, even those with the best on-screen chemistry. Barbossa was barely with Jack Sparrow, Sparrow was rarely with his ex-lover, and worst of all reliable Gibbs spent minimal time with Sparrow. When they are together, the humor, the banter, tension, and the charm works well. When they aren't, well, the movie drags a bit.Thank goodness the cast is still on their game. Johnny Depp once again breathes life into the pirate movie with his smart, unpredictable, and hilarious portrayal of Jack Sparrow. Despite what the reviews say, Jack Sparrow's shtick isn't getting old as he is still a delight to watch. Geoffrey Rush once again shines as Jack's best rival Barbossa, as his quiet intentions resemble that of Sparrow in earlier films. Penelope Cruz adds a layer of sexuality that we definitely did not have with the other Pirates of the Caribbeans--it's just a shame she didn't have much time with Sparrow. Director Rob Marshall was able to shell out good performances from everyone in the cast, but he definitely wasn't the man for this job.Almost all the chase scenes or action sequences were done with very low-lighting and poor camera angles. With the exception of the mesmerizing and chilling mermaid sequence and the opening chase, all the action moments were missing that special touch. While the bizarreness of Gore Verbinski will not be totally missed (although his style worked perfectly in Rango), his ability to crank out excellent stuntwork and fights was sorely missing here. At least we got to see plenty of it, from the opening chase to the final dramatic (and short) showdown. Say whatever you want, but there has yet to be anything that can top the infamous three-way sword fight/old mill showdown from Dead Man's Chest.Bottom Line: Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides is a mix of frustration and fun. There was plenty of potential that wasn't met because of questionable plot lines, pointless moments, lack of chemistry (once again: writer's fault. Good going Ted Elliot and Terry Rossio), and uneven direction. All that banter aside, Pirates is also plenty fun with several delightful moments, funny lines, and much more action than the last Pirates flick. Johnny Depp, Penelope Cruz and company keep the movie afloat, and prevent it from being a pure bore. But I think the franchise works better when Verbinski is behind the camera. On Stranger Tides is decent summer entertainment, but doesn't have the inescapable magic and charm of the first two.",7,205,277,20 May 2011
Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Your mouth will be moving a lot while watching this: whether it be by laughing or dropping your jaw so much
","Like a jolt of electricity into the world of cinema, Borat awakened the industry by delivering a shock treatment that can be capable of waking patients in lifelong comas. Controversy, bewilderment, amazement and eventually lawsuits surrounded this movie from the moment the trailer first aired, as a relatively unknown British comedian impacted the American life in a way not seen coming. Dressed as one of his alter-egos in his hit British show, Sacha Baron Cohen would practically fool almost all of America with his wild and crazy antics without ever breaking out of character. Inside the rather short 84 minutes of this picture lies some of the craziest scenes in recent memory, including one of the funniest and raunchiest fights you'll ever see in your life. As long as you can deal with its heavy shock humor, then you'll find Borat to be one of the funniest films in over a decade. But, if you are easily offended, or if you can only take so much sexual content, this must be skipped. And, if you are a Jewwell...let's just hope you have a sense of humor.In Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan, we follow a homophobic, sexist, racist, unintelligent, cheerful, and social citizen of a country full of problems (economic, social, Jew). To fight these problems, he is being sent to the United States to figure out how to better improve the country. Relying on very little script and much more on improvisation and what fooled Americans say, Borat is a tough movie to make. It is not easy at all to be able to find enough material without giving away the joke or exposing the joke. Nonetheless, thanks to sharp acting and improvising by Cohen and his assistant Ken Davitian, and also thanks to a series of very successful interactions with Americans, we have ourselves an amazingly hilarious film that isn't afraid to push any buttons. Directed loosely by Larry Charles and produced by Jay Roach, every aspect of Borat is silly and humorous; from the soundtrack to the one-liners to the reactions of Americans, leading straight up to the ending.Sacha Baron Cohen runs the show, steals the show, and prevents it from ever getting stale. With a heavy accent, a willingness to embarrass himself, and unafraid of anything, Cohen is everything Jamie Kennedy, Ashton Kutcher, and other pranksters wishes they could be. He comes off as so convincing; that it seems like nobody that interacted with him could tell that there was even a hint of potential that he was acting. Cohen doesn't lose any touch with his character for even a second; he probably stayed with those same clothes even after filming was done for the day. His acting deserves awards, maybe even an Oscar if the material wasn't such a hot button issue. But, we shouldn't take anything away from his assistant, Davitian, who can be just as funny. Both of them share some sort of comic chemistry that can be compared to the likes of the Frat Pack, specifically Owen Wilson and Vince Vaghan.While the movie is funny, it is not for everybody. Unlike the great comedies past and present that jumble up multiple ways to get a laugh, Borat is strictly shock humor, with a tiny hint of physical humor and satire. The quantity of shock humor is very heavy, comes is massive doses, and just might be too much for some viewers. Like previously stated, the only punches this film pulls is on time, as it clocks in at less than 90 minutes. This is more like Napoleon Dynamite, you are whether going to love it or hate it. Unlike Napoleon Dynamite though, Borat actually makes an effort (and actually has decent substance--and actually has effort in terms of camera-work).Bottom Line: If you can take it, watch this movie. Well-directed, well-acted, and just jaw dropping in multiple instances, Borat doesn't hold back and throws shocker after shocker until the movie is over. The film never runs out of material, never drags, and just never loses its edge. Perhaps the only thing it is missing is more scenes of the grief-stricken country Kazakhstan and its citizens, since they were all fun to watch in the beginning and in the end. Cohen fools half of America with his antics, and we receive nothing but pure enjoyment because of it. Highly recommend. It is not one of the greatest comedies of all-time, but does deserve the honor of being among the funniest movies this decade. Watch it, because remember, if this film not success, Borat will be executed.",9,0,5,24 March 2007
The Incredible Hulk," He traveled from where to where in just over two weeks!?!?!!?!?
","It is never a good sign for a franchise to receive a reboot after just one installment. However, Hulk gets a second chance with the latest film from the Marvel team that has brought us this summer's biggest hit and best film thus farand that's an answer that shall not change by the end of this review. The Incredible Hulk handles just like a comic book: bad dialogue, plenty of action, massive-sized plot holes, plenty of cameos, and ends with us asking for more. The movie fails to really lift the franchise from the ashes of mediocrity as yet again we receive a sub par Hulk movie that fails to bring out the best in our green hero. Good acting and decent CGI is hampered by too many other errors, setbacks, and disappointments that turn Hulk into nothing more than an American version of Godzilla. Yes, there's more to Hulk than meets the eye, but Louis Leterrier and company fail to deliver this to us.In a well-scripted prologue, we see Bruce Banner accidentally kill people and injure others after an experiment gone wrong; which we all know turns him into the Hulk. He hides in Brazil (Not the best place to hide if you are light-skinned, I know) as he tries to find a cure for his rage. While he hides and runs (In this movie, traveling from country to country and state to state on no money is no problem), the United States army is after him to use his accident and turn it into a successful innovation in warfare.This isn't a continuation of the original Hulk, it's rather a refresher, or a reboot; in the sense of Batman Begins and Casino Royale. After the prologue, the dialogue goes downhill in a most awful way. Whether its lines that aren't supposed to deliver a laugh, to lines that should not have been said at all, there are a lot of cringe-worthy moments in Hulk just listening to people talk. The acting doesn't exactly help either, as only Tim Roth and Edward Norton pulling off respectable performances. The two actors are well-known for their versatility and breathing life into any role, and they are no exception here until the CGI gets mixed in.While the trailers do promise action and more action, The Incredible Hulk is mostly running, hiding, talking, and preparation for the final act in the movie. The opening chase sequence is good; the rest of the action doesn't quite live up to it. When Banner becomes Hulk, it's like watching a very angry toddler wreck havoc on a town of Legos. Banner/Hulk just fails to have the charisma of Stark, the coolness of Batman, and the emotional depth of Peter Parker. Things get destroyed, and then Banner's love interest (pretty but meh Liv Tyler as Betty) stops the carnage; the formula doesn't quite change. Even the carnage itself becomes repetitive.Hulk does lack the dimensions of a deep character, but it's hard to like the main character when he becomes the vicious being. Being able to calm down for only the love interest in the entire movie doesn't exactly garnish brownie points from the audience; luckily the audience wants to see epic fights and destruction to the nth degree (These people should not question the appeal of Godzilla).Bottom Line: The Incredible Hulk is nothing like the Ang Lee version, but it still fails to live up to most Marvel comic book movies. There's so much that went wrong here, its hard to praise anything going on. Most of the acting is bland, the final fight isn't as epic as one would hope, and it lacks the fun of Iron Man. Perhaps this character was never meant to be in a movie; that or needs a strong supporting role to help him entertain the audience. Another major drawback is the amount of wicked cop-outs and sudden disappearances of supporting roles. Luckily the final scene gives us all hope, as we are seeing the beginning of something potentially awesome. In the meantime, we have to suck up another second-rate Hulk movie.At least its no Batman and Robin.",5,17,64,14 June 2008
The Monuments Men," Monuments Men is light entertainment that doesn't bore, but doesn't bring anything new either
","There is a good chance Saving Private Ryan ruined World War II movies for the rest of eternity because of its sheer realism and ability to not hold any of the carnage and insanity back.The Monuments Men's biggest issue is having to follow up to a masterpiece (that all war movies nowadays strive to become) with the similar credentials of covering an isolated incident that takes place in the middle of the deadliest war in modern history. Just like in Saving Private Ryan, Monuments Men is about preserving history before it gets swept up by the devastating conflict that leveled Eurasia. Private Ryan concerns pitting strangers together to save someone they don't know to prevent a family line from disappearing forever. With Monuments, it's about preserving art and culture before that gets permanently leveled by a war.World War II is never a fun subject, no matter which way you look at it. Even at its most entertaining, the usually humorously dark Tarantino kept Inglorious Basterds on check with its grim content. Having more humor than drama and suspense in the middle of such a sad time period with the threat always imminent makes for an awkward watch. Monuments Men never pretends to be a comedy, but the entire movie feels unfocused as Bill Murray (He doesn't have an Oscar yet..hmmm) throws one-liners centimeters away from death—with impending Nazi danger around the corner.And despite the stellar cast with decent performances (John Goodman and Cate Blanchett deserving some extra credit), despite the good cinematography and usual good direction from Hollywood staple George Clooney, the movie feels very by-the-numbers, paint-within-the-lines. It follows all the credentials, it checks off everything in the clichéd checklist for an inspiring historical drama. You have the likable characters, the necessary poetic deaths, and the uplifting ending in the midst of the odds being stacked against our heroes. So what else is there? The movie plays far too safe. And sometimes safe limits the impact. Saving Private Ryan leaves you numb, leaves you appreciating life, and leaves you desperately searching for good news during the two hours of intense filmmaking. Monuments Men never delivers an impactful emotional punch, even with the incredible true story that could have spawned a mini-series of some sort.Clooney is like that cool student that is smarter than he leads on, can strive for that A+. But with his latest film, he doesn't really aim for the A+, instead settling for the B grade with the PG-13 content in an environment that is anything but. And with that, the movie feels like a C. Watchable, but ultimately forgettable.",6,4,6,11 February 2014
Mission: Impossible III," The Alias version of a Mission: Impossible movie, but no folks this is not a complaint (2nd Submission)
","MI: 3 plays like an excellent yet much longer episode of Alias, basically. Whether this is a good thing or a bad thing is up to the viewer. As for me, I thought this was exactly what it needed. With an excellent blend of espionage, action, comedy, drama, and romance, Mission Impossible 3 proves that with a large enough budget, J.J. Abrams can weave a good story and create an entertaining popcorn flick. It is a very good way to start off the yearly barrage of summer films. Unlike most summer films, this one is actually pretty smart and never truly enters the 'mindless action film' zone. Is it the best Mission: Impossible? I wouldn't know, I haven't seen the first two. But, I am very sure that you will not leave the theater disappointed.Ethan Hunt returns after a good partner of hers is kidnapped trying to recover something. After a few unexpected moments and a failed mission, now the spotlight is on Ethan, as he hunts after a dangerous arms dealer that is threatening to end the life of Hunt's new wife. Can Ethan keep his life a secret and save his wife Lindsey from the clutches of the enemies? More or less this is the plot, and yes Alias fans, it sounds familiar. There are so many references and tie-ins with Abrams' previous creations that an Alias movie should not sound that bad of an idea. It even starts out Alias-style, in which we see Ethan tied-up, and just seconds away from death---then we are traced back to an earlier time, way before the moments of the very first scene in the film.Abrams and the scriptwriters do a fantastic job in building up the suspense, by giving us glimpses of the romance between Ethan and Lindsey and also the conversations amongst Ethan and his secret partners as they discuss why a marriage and working for the IMF could never mesh well. Also throughout the movie in between moments of tension and action, there are quirky one-liners and funny little moments that gives us a breath of fresh air after it gets sucked out from the last explosive scene. Clever and witty writing is a rarity nowadays in action movies; its nice to see that there is still some effort into writing for action movies at times. To top it all off, MI:3 is not as predictable as the average motion picture.Tom Cruise is such a versatile actor, he can do comedy, drama, sci-fi, action, he can do it all, and this is why he works well here. In this movie we see him at his angriest, his happiest, and at his weakest. He does his action scenes well and really blends well with the rest of the cast without really overshadowing any other performance. The best performance in the film by far is Philip Seymour Hoffman, he absolutely stole the spotlight the moment he begins his threats. The other actors and actresses did a decent job, none outstanding, with Ving Rhames having the best lines. Watch for a small cameo by an actor that has had plenty of screen time in the cult hit that put Abrams in the director's chair for this movie, Alias.Nothing is too over-the-top, and that is what excels most in this movie. MI:3's moments are not Transporter 2 or James Bonds' 'You've got to be kidding me' moments, but more like Alias's over-the-top-but-not-too-ridiculous stunts. Whether it's the awesome scene at Italy, or the action-packed sequence at the bridge, Mission Impossible 3 may be smart, but it is a summer film, and will entertain those action fanatics. The fights are not plentiful, either way that is quickly forgotten when the climax is approaching.Bottom Line: 2006's summer box office season is off to a good start as we have a talented man provide his touch to a well-known franchise, and delivering a smart and fun thriller that is sure to entertain audiences of all kinds, from the action buffs to those that like a little bit of everything in their films. J.J. Abrams has done it again, more props to him for skewing the franchise away from the typical mindless action film that we see all the time. Not as much dependence on special effects than on the interaction amongst the characters, the writing, and also the suspense that builds every time the team has to sneak into a building. Highly recommend, this should be the start of a good directorial career for Abrams. Tom Cruise, despite your off-screen antics, you have provided us with a decent third part of a potential trilogy, which almost never happens. Is there a part 4 on the horizon? Mission: Complete: MI:3 is entertaining.",8,1,1,18 May 2008
Captain Phillips," Intense biopic that will leave you paralyzed
","Gravity isn't the only heart-pounding drama concerning a very bad week in the workplace.Captain Phillips is a spellbinding and intense drama that focuses on an everyday man having to use every last ounce of his wits to survive a dreary situation that was always one bad move away from death. Based on the unbelievable true story of the first modern-day seizure of an American ship, this film chronicles the events concerning the hijacking starting from the first attempted attack right down to the final moment of the conflict. It was heroism and the 'No Man Left Behind' concept at its best, as many men and women were involved to try to arrive at a happy resolution to an ugly situation in foreign waters.Combining the legendary acting of Tom Hanks, superb acting from rookie Barkhad Abdi, and excellent direction from the hand-held camera expert Paul Greengrass, even if you know the story the film will trigger the senses of tension, fear, doubt, and uncertainty throughout the 130 minutes. That being said, the less you know about the true story, the more you will sweat.What the script adds however is a human element not seen in many military conflict-based films. You get a closer glimpse behind the thoughts and motivations of the pirates; they aren't just heartless monsters thirsty for blood. There are a few more layers behind their mannerisms and just why they are placing their entire lives on the line to commit a crime. Billy Ray does a great job giving personalities to characters that could have just as easily been caricatures.Lastly, we have Paul Greengrass' directing skillset coming in full circle. Combining the emotional pull of his United 93 with the technical pizazz of his Bourne series work that puts the viewers front and center to the conflict at hand, Greengrass is at his best here as he mixes intense close-ups with tight shots that raise the tension bar to the maximum. Finally, there is a beautiful marriage of great directing and great acting as the conflict reaches its surprisingly rough climax and we see Tom Hanks prove why he is a multiple-Oscar winner and always seems to deliver in every movie he is in.Although the movie does drag a bit in the second act and spends too much time building into the third (withholding some of the details could have elevated the unnerving mood even more), Captain Phillips is superb directing and acting mixed together to tell a wonderful story about overcoming dangerous odds when looking death right in the eyes.The movie doesn't break any new ground; it's just a stand-up nitty gritty thriller that stands as one of the best films of the year.",8,0,1,3 November 2013
Skyfall," Good action movie that almost feels like a Bond flick. Almost.
","It still barely feels like Bond, but this is still the best of the latest generation bunch and the best since the 1995 gem Goldeneye.Skyfall borrows from this recurring theme of cinema of taking well-known franchises and adding this dark reboot twist to give it a fresh perspective while also throwing some old-school flavor into it. The technique might be a bit odd, since this already happened in Casino Royale. Behind the camera is indie darling Sam Mendes, an accomplished director, to add some visual flair and technique to a film series that is mysteriously devoid of good directors and cinematographers. And Mendes' direction not only enhances the exotic film locations and exquisite action sequences, but also manages to hide most of the errors and setbacks behind the movie.The movie immediately takes off from the getgo, revealing the conflict within the first minute, and leading to an extended action/chase sequence that rivals among the best Bond has ever been involved in. And then we get taken by one of the better title sequences in recent memory featuring another strong Adele performance. How on earth was this film going to maintain the momentum of the first twenty minutes? Here's a little hint: it barely does.Daniel Craig has gotten a lot of criticism from the old-school Bond fans about his portrayal, and his performance here will not dwell the flames. That being said, Craig in his third round as the famed hero displays that he is indeed able to pull the charm, humor, sophistication, and suave of the other Bonds----if the writing staff can ever let him. But the writers and producers are hellbent on making sure that the Connery/Moore James Bond never makes its way back into the big screen.And this is where the movie mildly stumbles, not in directing or acting, but in the writing department. Composed by a three-person team, the plot never allows for us to get too comfortable with any of the supporting characters; from the Bond girls to not even the main villain—whom doesn't even show up in the first act (Despite it being brilliantly done by Javier Bardem, even if his character becomes extremely uneven towards the end). The final third inexplicably treads into prologue territory, when it could have been used earlier when the agency was in disarray as the conflict elevates when the entire cast of protagonists are under attack. And lastly, they still fail to give the movie the special James Bond touch, that little catalyst that for decades has separated itself from the usual action movie fare.Skyfall is part of the biggest enigma I face in cinema today: am I willing to accept this new direction of James Bond and his more brutal, dark, but more realistic look? Or should I yearn for the old-school days when it was hapless escapism that can hide any ridiculousness or stupidity with layers of charm, sexiness, and classy adult fun? These recent Bonds have been done with plenty of effort and quality, but what gets sacrificed is the little nitty-gritty sparks that made James Bond an icon in the first place. So I'm torn.In the meantime, I will accept Skyfall as a good, perfectly-directed action movie that survives a third act flounder and some questionable writing and hangs on as the best Bond since Pierce Brosnan.",8,3,8,15 November 2012
The Hangover," A hangover of a film that you won't soon forget.
","The Hangover is one of those movies that could have really been something special, if the pieces were placed together well. The plot was engaging, the acting was great, the pacing was perfect, and the premise itself is something unique and overall a win-win scenario. What was left? The content within the plot. The right blend of humor and comical suspense could elevate this to one of the comedic greats of recent decades. But, they just missed the mark, barely missed the mark. Oh, but it was so close. The Hangover is an excellent story about escapades and mayhem in Vegas and their consequences, but gets hindered because of the overload of crude humor, softer second act, and an under-written character that wasn't funny at all. Despite these setbacks, The Hangover is worthy of a viewing, especially if you enjoyed Todd Phillips' brand of crude adult humor.In the surprise-sleeper hit of the summer, we follow two good friends of the groom and the bride's brother taking the groom to Vegas for a bachelor party before the wedding. All of a sudden, it is morning, three of the four wakes up to a disastrous room; and a random baby nearby. Oh and there's a chicken and a tiger in the hotel room as well. One is missing a tooth, the other has scratches everywhere, and one is missing pants. The groom is missing. The rest of the movie is spent picking up clues as to what happened, how it happened, and where on earth the groom went. The setup is crazy, and the events that unfolded the evening before was just as crazy. This is a sort of script the mainstream hasn't experienced in quite some time. The movie becomes mostly comedy, but with hints of mystery as well.The best part of the movie is most definitely the screenplay, which was molded well by Jon Lucas and Scott Moore. Instead of a Ferrell or Apatow production which creates a situation and improvisation fills in the gaps, The Hangover relies strictly on plot and what twists and turns are thrown to our main characters. The hangover peeps encounter an angry Mike Tyson, disgruntled cops, gangsters, and much more in the span of 48 hours that follow the mysteriously drunken evening. This is the first raunchy comedy script I've seen that deserves at least an Oscar nod for its creativity since The 40-Year-Old Virgin several years ago.Of course, it's the premise that sold the tickets, since virtually nobody knew who was actually in the film. Nonetheless, Bradley Cooper and Ed Helms steal the show with their outstanding performances as the frontrunners in the chase for the truth of the previous evening and the groom. Everyone else (even Mike Tyson) does a respectable job, with the exception of one. Zach Galifianakis' role as the screw-loose brother of the bride just falls flat most of the time. His character comes cross as a mix of a pedophile, a druggie, and Brick from Anchorman (in terms of the random statements and questions). This mix fails because Steve Carell perfected the dimwit role as Brick, and there virtually no consistency with Alan's character. He is the one role that was not fleshed out.Your other drawback is the amount of crude humor. Crude humor is best in small doses (see: Blazing Saddles, Airplane, Dumb and Dumber, 40-Year-Old Virgin). In The Hangover, it's a bit overblown, and sometimes is used to try to save a scene. Todd Phillips improved upon his pacing abilities and good shots of Las Vegas, but still relies too much on crude humor and not enough on other ways to make the audience laugh. The tale didn't need the gross comedy, and would have been a great production altogether if they had toned down on the nastiness. The final scene makes you want to cringe almost.Bottom Line: Not as funny as everyone is making it out to be, but it's still a hilarious movie full of unpredictable moments and insanity. This sleeper hit proves you don't need big stars to make money; just deliver a premise too fun to pass up. The writing is superb, the acting (for the most part) is great, and the surprises keep you engaged with what is going on. If you can get past the crude, then you'll find a gem that's a few polishes away from truly shining among the greats. Instead, it settles for Phillips' best film since Old School, and one of the funniest raunch fests of the decade.",8,1,3,22 June 2009
Iron Man 3," Entertaining, Thrilling, but Quite Upsetting
","Iron Man 3 reminds me of the modern-day comic books that we are reading nowadays. Like the movie, the comics in this day and age are a good blend of entertaining, thought-provoking, controversial, and frustrating—while constantly screwing with the usual continuity of the comic book characters. With an action-comedy staple writing the script and directing the movie, this film is the ultimate evidence of what happens when you choose an accomplished staff (See: the infuriating Dark Knight Rises) over a lesser-known staff that is head over heels in love with the comic (See: The ever-pleasing Avengers).This frustratingly fun movie follows Tony Stark as he starts to hit rock bottom following the events of The Avengers and a rising threat that is attempting to spread terror and fear amongst the Americans---as if the aliens that had invaded New York previously wasn't enough. As Stark starts developing anxiety and worry about protecting his precious Pepper Potts, the Mandarin shakes things up by directly starting a war against Iron Man. Written by Shane Black, the movie feels less comic and more like a serious action movie with heavy buddy cop qualities seen in his earlier work.The two biggest gripes that the hardcore and the old-schoolers will experience while watching this is the very grounded plot that doesn't allow us to see Iron Man in much actual combat, and also the rather baffling portrayal of The Mandarin. Iron Man 3 feels like Dark Knight Rises in terms of character running time, as Bruce Wayne/Tony Stark has far more screen time than their alter-egos. Luckily, Robert Downey Jr.'s portrayal as Stark remains spot-on and absolutely brilliant---whether he is cracking jokes or cracking under pressure. His surprise partnership with a lonely 6-year-old was a nice added touch.Then there's The Mandarin.Oh boy.His portrayal here is so different from the comics that it may create a worldwide depression amongst the most avid of Iron Man fans. Even with an exhilarating final sequence that involves more Iron Man action and carnage than you can handle, the potential disgustingly bitter taste of seeing the very unique and rather ho-hum take on Iron Man's greatest nemesis will remain on your tongue.What the movie industry still hasn't fully figured out is that comic books are like video games---you need a truly, madly, deeply dedicated fan to translate the work into the big screen successfully and to the appeal of the masses. With comics and games the fans are more invested, more embedded in the culture than most other kinds of entertainment. This is why there has yet to actually be a good video game movie (although Scott Pilgrim and Wreck-It Ralph are good gamer cultured movies) and just a handful of good comic book films.Iron Man 3 will most definitely entertain with its great blend of action, comedy, heart, and a small hintage of suspense, I will give it a cinematic stamp of approval. The special effects was impressive, the direction and editing was crisp, and the entire cast did well with the script they were given. But forgiveness is a difficult thing, and I am not sure Shane Black and the Marvel staff will be forgiven for their---direction with the Iron Man franchise and brand.",8,1,6,3 May 2013
Marie Antoinette," A brutal disaster of bad writing, bad directing, and bad editing, Marie fails to entertain or even keep one's interest from the first minute on
","What happens when you mix a famous actress with a relatively unknown cast? What happens when you mix eighteenth century history with modern elements? What happens when a director screws up the entire film? You get Marie Antoinette. Directed quite dryly by Sopia Coppola, Marie is nothing more than eye candy; a slew of visuals but absolutely no content to back it up. The boredom associated with this two-hour snoozefest can be traced back to the writing which has no dialogue, the director which gives no direction, and well, that is about it. With little material to work with, Dunst and the others couldn't work their acting chops; that is, unless, it takes talent to stare at the camera and eat for several moments.Marie Antoinette is about the female-turned-queen whose antics were totally unfit for a woman of such high power, and also her wild life led to getting the blame when the country was short on money, and would eventually lead to her unexpected downfall. Along the way, she has trouble getting along with her destined husband, who unexpectedly becomes king. Both of them were expected to have a child right after marriage, but obvious conflicts in personality prevented this from happening for a very long time. From the very beginning, you see Marie getting ready to head to France to live a new life, and basically the film takes you through her entire life at the throne.Where this film goes wrong, does not happen with the acting or the casting. Kirsten Dunst is one of the main reasons why the Spider-Man movies easily have the best acting in any superhero movie franchise out there, by far. Her bubbly, cute, and charming appearance is then defaced by danger and conflict, revealing a confused, upset, bitter, and soft-shelled Mary Jane. In here, Dunst has absolutely nothing to work with. She has to talk a little (not even with an accent, director's decision), eat a lot, and look at the camera; that is it. With the content presented, Dunst does a good job, but she should have been given more, she should have had a chance to prove herself as an actress. But, Coppola didn't focus on acting at all. If that were the case, then the other people would actually sound French, then the other people would actually talk with emotion attached. The acting was not the problem here.Poorly written, poorly constructed, poorly edited, and poorly directed; all the major flaws of Marie Antoinette. It takes more than an hour for Marie and her husband, Louis XVI, to have any sort of romantic connection, but then it takes less than ten minutes for four years and three children to pass by. The pacing is practically awful, its too slow most of the time and then way too fast when it doesn't need to be. Repetitive shots of Marie waking up in the morning and repetitive shots of Marie and Louis eating in front of their servants doesn't exactly help the pacing either.Where is the dialogue? People can actually watch the first half hour with their ears covered and not actually have to miss important tidbits of conversation. More or less, it's because there is about one or two conversations in the entire first act! What seems to be the focus is the costumes, the scenery, the landscape surrounding the lifeless cast of characters with nothing to say. But, then we have modern music being blasted amongst the fancy and sophisticated cinematography.The reason for modern things being added to eighteenth century France? No idea. It's not proving a point, it doesn't enhance the experience, and it really doesn't help the movie in the least bit. With many things featured in the movie that at the time the film is taking place doesn't even exist yet (special fireworks, champagne bottles). With the direction being a mess, the viewer has absolutely no idea as to whether or not we are supposed to sympathize with Marie. On one hand, she looks like she's heartbroken; yet on several moments she is seen partying, having fun, and then cheating on her husband.On another moment, it looks as if she is being unfairly blamed for the economic troubles of France. Yet there is much more footage of her spending too much money and not enough footage of the French leaders discussing the American Revolution, the actual reason behind the demise in economic status in the grief-stricken country. Coopla can find a good shot of flowers, but for the life in her cannot figure out where to go with this motion picture. Then, like Marie's life, the movie ends abruptly, in a most awkward and frustrating manner.Bottom Line: This is a royal mess. With no dialogue, lack of direction, lack of decent editing, too much running time, and no willingness to make this movie even remotely resembling the time period, Marie Antoinette is bad enough to make historians throw up watching it, and it's bad enough to make even the most awake of viewers fall asleep. It must have been a lot more fun filming it than watching it. Dunst and the acting cast is not to blame, everyone else is. While classical/modern mixing is a tough genre (done well by 'A Knight's Tale') Coppola had it wrong from the get go, to the very end.",2,3,6,30 October 2006
In Bruges," If you can't laugh at a man being blinded in one eye by a blank, then this isn't for you
","2008 had two high-profile crime time comedies that blended action with suspense and a hintage of good ol' European humor. On one hand, we have the slick Rockn'Rolla that brought Guy Ritchie back into the spotlight, and now we have a new-school director delivering one of the most unique hit-man films in a very long time. In Bruges is one of those rare examples in which the comedy is so bleak, so dark, it can barely pass off as humor depending on the viewer. Marketed as a quirky action comedy; this film doesn't match the genre in the least bit. Instead we have a deep character study that focuses on the moral implications of the main characters, as they tour around a beautiful yet overlooked city. It's definitely not everyone's cup of tea. The film itself is interesting and fleshes out a clever story; but never quite gets off the ground, never quite propels itself to become a highly entertaining film. Then of course, we have the indie ending.In Bruges follows two hit men that must lay low after a mission went horrifically wrong. While Ray (Colin Ferell) soaks in the bitterness and guilt over his murder, Ray's partner Ken soaks in all the beautiful scenery and curiosity of the area. They both become well-acquainted with the place, meeting all sorts of characters. However, things become complicated when their boss (Ralph Fieness) has a new job for one of them. This is the debut feature-film script and directorial effort by Martin McDonagh as he crafts a good tale that has the same style of dark humor and tense action as his acclaimed short film from years ago. Originality is all over the place in this film, as dark humor is a tough genre to sell and deliver; it's rarely ever done successfully.The film is a delightful character study about people's actions, reactions, and the codes they must follow. Irony and subtle humor is also heavily present, as the mere premise of two murderous hit men touring around a secluded town like tourists is sure to tickle the funnybone. The script also calls for sympathy towards our anti-heroes, which is definitely a hard task that McDonagh tackled with ease. Helping the writing is superb acting by Ferell and Brendan Gleeson. If they don't interest you, Bruges certainly will. Bruges is basically a character in the film, as it adjusts and alters the mindsets and morality codes of our assassins. Beautiful scenery and nice cinematography makes In Bruges a travel documentary with a fictional story attached.However, the dark humor in the movie is a bit too dark. The movie can barely classify as a comedy because there's so much tension, so much violence, and so many heavy themes. A few chuckles will occur, but it's offset by the bitter humor that leaves you cringing at times. In Bruges in other reviews has been described as 'Irish humor.' If that's the case, Irish humor is definitely not my cup of tea, as its comedy is disguised in heavy drama.Bottom Line: A nicely written and acted film, marred by so-called 'comedy.' The humor comes off as bitterly dark and sometimes even dwells into the outright bizarre. If you can handle the dark chocolate-like taste (the 85% cacao bean kind), then you are in for a treat. The story is unique, so are the characters and situations they are involved in. This just might be American mainstream's first taste of Irish flavored film-making in years, and you can whether enjoy the flavor or move on. While the movie itself isn't amazing, this new-school director deserves a bit of attention for a strong first effort. In Bruges: a documentary with bullets and bodies.The food there looks good though.",6,6,14,25 May 2009
Kung Fu Panda," 'Yesterday is history, tomorrow is a mystery. Today is a gift, which is why we call it the present
","The wonderful bit of dialogue mentioned just above is not from an artsy fartsy movie or some sweeping epic that will stun the Academy for years to come. Instead, we receive this nice line (albeit used before) from the surprisingly good Kung Fu Panda. While it is not even close to being original, Kung Fu Panda is surprisingly funny, surprisingly rich, and has a surprising amount of decent fight choreography that might even impress the legend Jackie Chan. With Jack Black and Dustin Hoffman leading the way with their superb voice acting skills, we have the best animated Dreamworks picture since Madagascar. Yes, this includes the Shrek sequels.Kung Fu Panda follows Po (Jack Black), a friendly fat panda that has one dream in life, and that is to be the best at martial arts. Unfortunately, his size and his lack of coordination hamper his potential. His opportunity actually arrives after he is revealed to be the chosen one that will save the village from an extremely angry tiger. Much to the dismay of the better fighters in the area and their trainer (Dustin Hoffman), they must whether accept this revelation of attempt to take in the role of protectors themselves. As you can tell, the plot borrows heavily from other films past and present, but we're not totally about the narrativebesides, the short running time doesn't allow us to dwell into the storyline either.Visually, the movie is the best since Madagascar as well. While the Shrek sequels never attempt to enter the next level in animation to the likes of Cars and Ratatouille, or attempt to try something different, Kung Fu Panda offers a variety of animated styles that includes but isn't limited to: slowing the action down, freeze-framing some shots, rendering into 2-D, and then sometimes speeding up the action so quickly you have to be paying attention closely or you'll miss out. The physical humor here resembles that of Madagascar; fast-paced, witty, and with plenty of it to go about. The fights themselves are actually well-choreographed and quite creative; some of the best you'll see in quite some time. A good fight is tough to film, even tougher to create from scratch. The advantage of animation is that you can manipulate the camera and allow it to catch up to the action, and they use this ability well. Unfortunately, the good action sequences occur only in the second half of the movie.Besides Jack Black and Dustin Hoffman, the voice acting isn't that wonderful. There is no point in Jackie Chan, Lucy Liu, and Angelina Jolie getting paid the millions they are probably receiving for their rolesthey barely have over 20 lines in the film. The main chemistry and relationship that works well in Kung Fu Panda is that of the main character and his mentor. Dustim Hoffman's performance as the mentor is easily one of the best animated performances of the decade, going up there with Ellen DeGeneres in Finding Nemo, Holly Hunter in The Incredibles, and Sacha Baron Cohen in Madagascar.Bottom Line: Kung Fu Panda starts off slow, but then builds plenty of momentum once the story shifts gears and the climax is approaching (literally and figuratively). The fights are good, the animation is good, the laughs are definitely in here, and its surprisingly rich dialogue offers some useful advice for kids and adults. The movie isn't going to be a hallmark in film history like Pixar's best work, but it's definitely better than most Dreamworks animated films. Kung Fu Panda is a good original story that will entertain audiences of all ages.P.S. Dreamworks was smart in releasing this before the heavily-buzzed Wall-E.",8,3,6,9 June 2008
Gravity," Side-Effects to Gravity includes shortness of breath, elevated heartrate, and pure visual stimulation
","And you think your job sucks...Containing some of the most claustrophobic space action since Alien, Gravity is a very tense and visually stimulating movie that contains some of the best usage of special effects in film within the past several decades. In a fashion similar to 2001: A Space Odyssey, dialogue takes a backseat and all focus is on the imagery involving a struggle within the cold harsh world of outer space.Every once in a while comes a movie that upon first viewing you become sure that it is going to nab every technical Oscar of the year. Terminator 2, Titanic, The Matrix, Inception, and Avatar comes into mind. Gravity falls into the same grouping because of its flawless usage of sound, camera-work, and special effects. Similar to how Jurassic Park shaped the way we see and hear dinosaurs on film, Gravity will be sure to do the same to outer space. With this film, outer space isn't just a backdrop, it is a true living, breathing environment that deserves to be respected and feared.Without revealing too much, Gravity follows two astronauts as they struggle to survive within the boondocks of planet Earth when impending danger starts approaching their workspace. While the addition of George Clooney and Sandra Bullock doesn't exactly enhance the movie, their performances were quite good. But the best performance is that of Alfonso Curason, whose mix of close-ups, intense shots, elongated scenes, and astounding visual details makes this easily one of the best directing efforts in the past few years. The half decade spent on this production pays off, and it clearly shows why it took so long.However, this movie's Hollywood mannerisms definitely hindered this from becoming a bonafide instant classic to the tune of 2001 (although I am in the minority and feel like Kubrick's space opera is a rather overrated work). Not seeing this in 3-D, it is obvious that some of the details in the movie were done less to move the plot and exercise the technical details and more because it was going to be released in 3-D and wanted to hand moviegoers its money's worth. Then there's the rather overbloated, overproduced, and overdramatic musical score done by a Doing-My-Best-Hans-Zimmer-Impression Steven Price. Against Hollywood wishes, the movie could have excelled even more relying purely on sound effects (and lack of) similar to No Country For Old Men.Despite the two small gripes that prevent it from being a new-age Star Wars, Alien, or other sci-fi outer space masterpieces, Gravity is nonetheless a spectacular work of suffocating intensity that leaves you breathless throughout the merciful runtime of 90 minutes. Like the best visual works in film history, this is best enjoyed in the theater in front of a massive screen surrounded by darkness. In a year lacking of Best Picture quality films (so far), Gravity stands tall as the first great movie of the fall season.Just be prepared to take deep breaths. This movie will take them away.",9,2,3,10 October 2013
Inglourious Basterds," I do not remember this event happening that way in the history books...
","In all of Hollywood, there is no other man that enjoys cinema as much as Quentin Tarantino. With much subtle glee he writes and directs films that defy any genre that exists, defy any unwritten rules that are made about film-making, and ultimately gives hopes to your typical film geeks that despite your ability to quote and reference obscure movies that nobody else has watched, you too can become a major success story. He is a film dork's hero, and he is most likely well aware of this. With his latest film, Inglorious Basterds (Title loosely taken from an obscure 1978 flick you most likely have not seen), he takes the warfare/Nazism genre and injects it with a major dose of spaghetti western flavor and a stronger dosage of inaccuracy.The movie itself has been a pet project of Tarantino's for quite some time. The end result is a crazy flick that mixes war drama with heavy western tension, dark comedy, and the same hyper violence that you've come to expect with Tarantino fare. It's a take it or leave it kind of deal; if you could barely tolerate Kill Bill, Pulp Fiction, or Death Proof, then Inglorious Basterds will indeed frustrate and perhaps even confuse you. Otherwise, if you are a fan of his work, then you'll appreciate it much more. While Basterds lacks the pop culture fun of Pulp Fiction, the intense action of Kill Bill, or an eternally memorable character (like Bill, Stuntman Mike, Jules, Pai Mei), the film is full of tension, entertaining drama, rich surprises, and an ability to keep you entertained.Inglorious Basterds follows a group of Jewish-American soldiers (led by Brad Pitt) hell-bent on annihilating any Nazi they cross paths with, and find themselves with a golden opportunity to end the war once and for all. This opportunity comes with a screening of a German film in a small movie theater led by a Jewish woman (Mélanie Laurent) whom saw her family mercilessly murdered upon the direction of a cruel detective (Christoph Waltz). Several characters and plot twists later, the film ends on a crazy finale that will whether frustrate you or satisfy you to the maximum. Let's just say World War II is not a dramatic event here, it's just a setting.Tarantino's best strength lies in his writing, not his directing. In his films, he creates many absurd characters that are larger-than-life, and also fills them up with crazy actions, crazier dialogue, and insane conclusions. Almost all his movies have that one epically-written scene (Reservoir: the introduction, Pulp Fiction: final Mexican standoff, Kill Bill: the Superman monologue). In here, the opening sequence sets the mood of the movie right away: tense, crazy, over-the-top, and quite emotionally-driven. The opening scene nearly mirrors that of the first time you see Angel Eyes in The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly. Another fun thing about Tarantino's writing is the amount of film references you see sprinkled throughout the 150-plus minutes. Few writers implement more details than this man. Seeing every movie at a video store definitely has its rewards.Another amazing thing about Quentin is how he can manage to pull off incredible performances from the most random of people. Mike Myers is one grand example, and the underrated Diane Kruger (National Treasure) is another. Then there's the always-reliable Brad Pitt, and the scene-stealing performance of Christoph Waltz as the unpredictably smart Nazi detective. I hope there's at least one Oscar nomination in acting from this movie otherwise the snub card can be used.The fact of the matter is, Inglorious Baterds is a violent film that breaks all kinds of rules (film-making and historical). Those that are looking for a historical war film should search elsewhere. Those with weak constitutions and those with a little more sensitivity in their blood should avoid this. The morality of this movie was heavily questioned. But it's a film called Inglorious Basterds, what else did you expect? The line between hero and villain is obscure, heroes are seen without mercy, and even the victims get their chance at revenge. Its a dog-eat-dog movie in which karma doesn't hit all the players in the field. The in-your-face attitude of Tarantino is all-to-present here, as we have over-the-top characters in over-the-top situations for two and a half hours. The movie plays like a roller coaster ride with a very intense yet abrupt ending.Bottom Line: There isn't as much action here as there was in Kill Bill. There wasn't as much comedy as you would find in Pulp Fiction. And the grittiness of Reservoir Dogs isn't here too. This isn't his best movie, but darn it even a mediocre movie from Tarantino is about the same value as a good summer flick. While the movie may warrant a second viewing to truly capture the madness, Inglorious Basterds is a crazy time in an alternate universe where World War II is hosting a different set of rules, events, and conclusions. By the end of it all, you'll prefer this version over the version the history books have. There is nobody that loves film-making and genre-bending more than Tarantino, and this movie is just the latest example in an interesting career.Its fun, exciting, very tense (In a Leone kind of way), and has plenty of good music, good surprises, good performances, and plenty of well-directed scenes. In the heap of disappointing 2009 summer movies, we finally have one that rise above mediocrity because of the effort, attention, and care given to the production. Good work Tarantino, you've mind warped another group of moviegoers with your forever-bending genres and forever-mad stories.",8,1,6,22 September 2009
Iron Man 2," The Spider-Man 3 Syndrome: Exhibit: C
","The first Iron Man was different from your average comic book movie because it lacked the unnecessary drama, instead replacing it with many more laughs, a much more likable main character, and plenty of comic book flair usually missing from the other comic movies. With the success of Iron Man, Marvel Studios decided to go forth with their long-waited and epic idea to bring a few of their best heroes together into one massive flick that will make anybody that is a fan of comic books squeal with glee and delight. The Avengers is sure to become the biggest addition of comic book film-making since the original Spider-Man broke barriers and records many years ago. The Avengers will be incredible.Which leads to the biggest issue of Iron Man 2: the film is just a tad notch above set-up flick. Just like what Dead Man's Chest in the Pirates franchise did, Iron Man 2 became a 2-hour movie with a slew of conflicts in which were not all resolved because there is another installment coming. Suffering from the Spider-Man 3 effect, Iron Man 2 is chock full of story lines interweaving together, and not all of them are interesting, and not all of them even reach a resolution. We see more Tony Stark than Iron Man. The cameos steal the spotlight. Some of the villains were whether annoying or as much of a threat as a newborn puppy. Many pieces were built around the set, but not all of them fit.Tony Stark 2—er, I mean, Iron Man 2 is about our hero (Robert Downey Jr.) taking on the government, rivals, and even his own health—which is depleting rapidly because of hit artificial 'heart.' With his health slowly dying away, he starts drinking, acting even more eccentric, and even stepped down from his CEO duties. In the meantime, the Iron Man technology is being imitated around the world, with an intelligent Russian (Mickey Rourke) trying to kill Stark with his own version of a powersuit. Justin Theroux provides the screenplay, and stuffs it up with cameos, references to the future, problems, villains, and a few plot lines from old-school Iron Man comic book issues. A lot goes on.Let's at least marvel at the powerhouse cast. Robert Downey Jr. does an excellent job as Tony Stark/Iron Man yet again, providing a great blend of narcissism with subtle fear of death. Gwyneth Paltrow doesn't get much screen time yet again but does a great job with the material she has. Other performances throughout the movie were very good, including Garry Shandling, Mickey Rourke, Samuel L. Jackson, Sam Rockwell, Don Cheadle, and to an extent Scarlett Johansson (whose fighting skills nearly stole the entire show). Great performances, but nearly all the supporting actors I mentioned didn't have much time to truly craft a whimsical, memorable performance to the likes of Heath Ledger as the Joker, Rosemary Harris as Aunt May, or William Dafoe as Green Goblin.The acting isn't the only thing chock full of small samples and no main course; there was little action, little tension, little chemistry between the two leads, and little suspense. What progresses the movie and prevented it from being a total disaster was Robert Downey Jr. entertaining the masses with his portrayal of Stark. Granted this is a movie about Tony Stark, but the film is called Iron Man, and one would hope for more of him in the suit. As a matter of fact, Iron Man engages in action in only three scenes, with one of them being extremely short. Just like in the original, the final epic battle was extremely short, extremely underwhelming, and very anti-climactic. Whiplash could have been an intimidating force to the likes of the Joker (in both versions, shut up), Doc Ock in Spider-Man 2, and Syndrome in The Incredibles (not a Marvel villain but a comic book-like villain nonetheless).Like a cruelly beautiful woman, the film is a big tease. There are a lot of characters, but they aren't in the film enough. The special effects were very good, but were not used a lot for the action scenes. Plenty of hints and references towards other Marvel comic books, but none of them lasted more than a minute (even though the last one was indeed------wow). Another problem is that the freshness and originality of Iron Man disappeared, which made this a tougher follow-up than one would assume. Is the film disappointing? Yea, loosely. Is it entertaining? Most definitely, but the potential carried is what makes this a somewhat-frustrating movie. It made most of us beg like an unsatisfied bum for 2011 and 2012 to arrive so we can see more (and longer) comic book crossovers.Bottom Line: Iron Man 2 is most definitely entertaining and loads of fun—sometimes. Other times, we are watching a storyline we don't really care about, watching appearances we know should last longer, or watching potential get ruined because it's being carried over to the next installment of the Marvel movie-making franchise. While this is more script issues than directing issues (Jon Favreau did a decent job, but his character wasn't necessary at all), someone during the production should have stood up and shouted 'What's with all the loose Walt Disney references??' Wait, wait, wait, I meant 'Isn't this a repeat of what happened to Spider-Man 3??' Iron Man 2 = Spider-Man 3, except more fun, much less embarrassing, and a better-looking future. The film isn't a boring disaster, but you are constantly left with a desire for more--long before the movie is even over. Now why can't this Avengers movie come faster?",6,2,5,7 May 2010
Zootopia," Delicious dark chocolate, Zootopia looks colorful, tastes dark, but will be among the best films of 2016
","Some movies perfectly personifies the past (Saving Private Ryan), some movies predict the future (Fight Club), and some (like this one) perfectly nail the current issues so accurately you feel like they financed, wrote, and filmed the movie yesterday. Read the following sentence slowly because you might not believe it the first time you glance through it: Zootopia is the best film under the Walt Disney Animation Studios banner since Emperor's New Groove, and is arguably the most important animated film since Princess and the Frog. Yes, the clock has to reach back 16 years before you can find a Disney Studios animated film as strong as this one. Between the layers of intense subject matter and a surprisingly strong mystery plot lies a beautiful message for the kids and tweens that needs to be heard, especially today. Nothing on the surface can actually prepare you for what happens once you enter the setting of Zootopia. However, the surface is quite delightful to look at. The animation is spectacularly detailed and contributes mightily to the storyline about animals living together. The main city itself branches off into several subdivisions, each with its own distinctive personality. Unlike most Disney films, Zootopia itself is so massive its practically begging for continuations through film and television. It's an expansive visual feast of colors and colorful characters, similar to the creative world of Wreck-It Ralph. However, once the movie gets going you will quickly realize that although it is a children's movie, there is plenty for teenagers and even adults to laugh at and to be moved by. The mystery is slightly more mature than what is expected, and we even reach quite dark territory once the second half kicks into play. This is a children's movie, but has an incredible script full of heart, soul, drama, and necessary comedy to offset the bleakness. Using Pixar's collective creativity technique (which has been rusting lately), we have three directors and nearly a dozen writing credits attached (two wrote the screenplay, many others contributed to the story). It is a miracle that so many contributors to a single script made a film that flowed so well. Disney and Pixar are the best at coming up with the required vocal talents to bring the animated films to life, and this is no exception. Jennifer Goodwin and Jason Bateman are absolutely perfect for each other and play to their strengths: Goodwin with her charming all-American bubbliness and Bateman's sly hustling ways. They dominate the film but luckily you'll learn to love them immediately through their strengths and their flaws. And in keeping with recent tradition, you won't know who the true villain is until later as the stakes start getting higher.Rich Moore (most experienced of the three-director team) should be a bigger name because his directing credits includes the early 90s Simpsons and some of Futurama's greatest episodes. What those shows and this film has in common is the electric mix of well-paced story, strong characters, and shades of drama and commentary that speaks to the current issues. Zootopia explores racism, sexism, classism, and diversity fears better than any of the trailblazing Disney animated films before it. That being said, it's not a knock on Princess and the Frog, Mulan, or Hunchback of Notre Dame---the truth is Zootopia would have never been fully greenlit by Disney in the 90s, and perhaps even the 2000s. Disney has gotten gutsier and ballsier in recent years with the Too Big to Fail attitude; and although the company definitely remains officially mum on the current political turmoil, Zootopia can and should be its resume and cover letter concerning what side of the fight they are on. Zootopia is a daring animated film that will frighten you (especially the youngsters), will emotionally hurt you, and will leave you thinking long after Shakira's gazelle character lets out her final note. It's the perfect concoction of mystery, comedy, action, and social commentary that not only allows it to become an early entry for Best Animated Feature, but (dare I say it), a Best Picture nomination. Zootopia on the surface, beneath the surface, and everywhere in between is essentially flawless. It has something for everyone, although the youngest ones will struggle as it gets darker. Through its importance as well as the engaging, ever-revolving plot, I give this film the highest marks. Zootopia will stand as one of the best in all of 2016, and among the best works of animation this entire decade. Disney has unveiled its stance through adorable animals while simultaneously proving that it remains the animation king of the world.",10,50,100,6 March 2016
42," Follows the formula, but doesn't add any zest to it.
","42 is the cinematic equivalent of a great hitter smashing a double—but not even considering going to third base even if he had a slight chance.42 is an entertaining movie. It is motivating. It has all the qualities of your inspiring American story about an individual rising up against the ranks and accomplishing their far-fetched goals. The Rocky formula was nicely dropped on the Jackie Robinson story as this legendary player had to go up against layers of racism within the sport of baseball while also dealing with his team's tough pennant race. The movie had the personality that makes it immediately likable. You can't dislike this movie. You honestly can't.The cast is good. The cinematography is good. The production value is grand. The effort is clearly here. All the cylinders are working.But in spite of all this, 42 doesn't attempt to go the next step. This movie plays it extremely safe. It is a rough rated-R story that became condensed and watered-down to a PG-13 flick. It dabbles into the surface of racism, but doesn't dwell too deep. It only covers his early days, and doesn't cover the aftermath and his later years. The problems didn't exactly go away just because he survived his first year. Jackie Robinson's entire career was met with resistance. Some can argue he died younger because of all the stress associated with being the controversial pioneer.What bogs this movie the most is that we have seen it all before, as sad as it sounds. He even starred in his own documentary back in the 1950s for crying out loud. A good movie will accurately portray the drama; but a great movie will make you practically experience it. It is this element that makes the World War II flick Thin Red Line a good movie, and Saving Private Ryan the one that represents and dominates the genre.So 42 will entertain you and will make you root for the lead characters, but don't expect it to add anything new to the table.",7,5,5,23 October 2013
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," Dead Man's Chest revives hope in the movie industry as it delivers action, humor, horror, a fun story, and more Sparrow
","Who's up for another ghost tale involving the seven seas, pirates, the undead, and the forever cursed? Dead Man's Chest is a heavily hyped sequel to the original surprise hit that restarted the average moviegoer's love for swashbuckling adventures and also introduced us to Jack Sparrow, one of the coolest movie characters to come out in recent years. Most of the cast from the original came back, and this time the franchise was going to branch out into a trilogy. While the film clocks in at a long 150 minutes, Dead Man's Chest has so much going for it that you will not mind, even if the pacing is not that of the typical popcorn flick.The pace of the original Pirates movie starts out slow and then speeds up especially towards the end. Dead Man's Chest does this same thing, except its even slower in the beginning, and then really picks up in the middle and ends with you gasping for air after all the disbelief and unbelievable moments shown on the big screen. The story this time centers on Jack Sparrow as suddenly his time to end his debt with Davy Jones, a very-feared and legendary captain of an evil ghost ship, is running out. With this dilemma at hand, he once again brings Will and Elizabeth into the adventure, as well as some familiar faces from the original. In the meantime, conspiracies and mysterious circumstances are brewing up in Elizabeth and Will's homeland. The plot is much more constricted and tangled up the second time around, even though the writers were able to add some seemingly unnecessary scenes for some comic relief.Johnny Depp seems to be born to play the part of Jack Sparrow, because he does it so well, perhaps too well for his own good. He is just as funny, just as entertaining, and just as cruel and unusual in the second installment, as we get to see much more of him. Knightley and Bloom were not half-bad as the love struck victims of the entire ordeal, and while Bill Nighy is most certainly no Geoffrey Rush, not even close, he does a good job as the fearful captain. Unlike the average summer flick, the acting was decent, not Oscar-worthy (besides Depp), but passable. When the actors are not talking, its all the action-packed sequences and spectacular special effects that fill the screen. Without a doubt, some of the best-looking effects in recent years are displayed here, ranging from the disgusting-looking pirates, the Flying Dutchman itself, and the sea monster that gets summoned a few times. Davy Jones looks menacing and the staff does a great job in not overdoing the special effects and CGI.While the action may have been lacking in the beginning, its everywhere in the second half of the movie. The first half was the introduction to the conflict and to the enemies in the movie; the second half is everyone going at it, whether it's a ship against a monster, or a three-way fight, or pirates against an invincible crew of damned souls, or a silly humorous fight amongst a bunch of drunk pirates and convicts. While Dead Man's Chest is not for mindless action fans, the second half has so much carnage and swordplay and unbelievable moments that it will make the average fanatic drool with anticipation for the next big moment. The three-way fight hands-down is one of the best action sequences you will ever see, guaranteed. Starting with just three people going at it, it escalates into amazing lengths, as Gore Verbinski stretches a simple fight into a complex turn of events with fun twists and never-ending fights between the hero of the story, the main character, and a third person who will not be mentioned in this review.Like the original, Dead Man's Chest has a bit of everything: plot twists, action, humor, horror, drama, romance, and a lot of fantasy. The best part is, it has plenty of nods to the original movie, and plenty of references to the ride as well, and even to older literature. Has a bit of everything for the average viewer to enjoy, and while it is most certainly the most violent thing to garnish the Walt Disney name, it still has that bit of Disney magic that has made us return to Disney films time and time again. It is a ride through the open seas as you get to see it all, beautiful women, evil villains, colorful characters, huge monsters, treasure, and more stories to keep your thirst for nicely-woven sea tales quenched until next year, when we see the grand finale. Oh, the ending to this movie was grand as well, with a few pleasant surprises.Bottom Line: Not as fresh as the original, but just as entertaining, as it has a bit of everything, and more Jack Sparrow. Action, comedy, drama, and a hint of horror, Dead Man's Chest is in every way a good film, as it stacks up well to the original, and to action sequels in the past. This is quickly gaining potential in becoming the best action franchise since the masterpiece Indiana Jones movies of the 1980s. Recommend to everyone, and as long as you can put up with the slow pacing, you will not leave the theater disappointed. Dead Man's Chest: More Sparrow, more pirates, more fun, and more reasons to look forward to the 2007 summer movie season.",9,3,5,10 July 2006
Argo," Argo is a tense but enjoyable cinematic trip with a 70s feel
","Craving a tense, heart-pounding political thriller that doesn't let go of its grip until the end? Look no further, we have Argo.Argo is a skillfully directed and shot film that keeps the audiences riveted with its colorful cast of characters, extreme moments of tension, tight script that doesn't offer any slow moments, and a subtle political undertone about the continuing crisis that occur in the Middle East between the ruthless leaders and the citizens that are always inches from exploding in pure anger.Based off of a compelling true story that takes place in the Iran Hostage Crisis of 1979, Argo follows one man creating a fake film studio and film production so he can pose as a Canadian filmmaker as he searches for the missing Americans that fled the embassy that came under attack by angry mobs of Iranian citizens. The first half focuses on the planning, and the more riveting half focuses on the execution.This movie has 70s political thriller written all over it, from the substance to the style. Ben Affleck gives his best directing performance here as he shoots the film with a 70s look and feel to add realism to the conflict while at the same time paying homage to classic dialogue-heavy thrillers like All the President's Men and Dog Day Afternoon.His old-school, close-up style of filmmaking helped his first two features, and it definitely enhances the anxiety of the moments when the characters can be seen in the hostile environment of Iran. You will hear your heart as the cast drives through the heart of the rebellion.The best of movies can successfully combine drama with humor, and the dark humor of Argo helps the viewer relax and breathe a little as the stakes get raised higher and higher. This movie is actually surprisingly funny, with the best lines being delivered by the veteran actors John Goodman (where's his Oscar?) and Alan Arkin. The rest of the cast does a wonderful job being likable and being people you want to root for during their highs and their low points.Bottom Line: 120 minutes of heart-pounding drama and heavy content is what makes Argo one of the best films of the year, and pretty much certifies Ben Affleck as a successful and good director that manages to erase his ugly streak of bad movies. There isn't a dull moment here as you will remain glued to the screen up until the very end. Its good old-fashioned gritty filmmaking at its finest, with characters moreso than action running the show.",9,1,2,14 October 2012
Star Trek Into Darkness," A Good Ol' Fashioned Superior Blockbuster Sequel
","In every good blockbuster sequel, the stakes have to be higher, the conflict must be bigger, and there must be an added depth of darkness. Ever since Empire Strikes Back, this has become the go-to formula for all big sequels: start big, and then aim higher. You walk with the original, you dash with the sequel. Star Trek Into Darkness does a superb job following this technique and delivers an extremely exhilarating thrill ride that ramps up on an intensity level I have never before witnessed with anything associated with Star Trek---especially, especially on the final act.Without spoiling too much (After all, with J.J. Abrams, you can never just give a synopsis to any of his work) the cast of the Enterprise get to experience a new threat that started from within the fleet and has practically begun to stage a war against the entire organization. Captain Kirk (Chris Pine) must face his greatest challenges while at the same time trying to maintain his stability as Captain. Alright, that's pretty much all I can give you: plus a couple new characters, a new villain (Benedict Cumberpatch) entering the mix of the rebooted franchise.With a writing team that has worked extensively with Abrams before (Lost, Fringe, Alias, Star Trek 09) this movie contains plenty of content, and plenty of grandiose themes about family and sacrifice. This summer movie isn't shallow, it makes you care for the characters, feel for the more sentimental moments, and root for the team to survive one of their seemingly dozens of close calls. While I really couldn't have cared less for one of the new characters (She might be blonde and might be the only one shown in a bra) the rest of the cast was back and fun to watch—especially Simon Pegg as Scotty.After it was announced that Star Wars 7 was being helmed by Abrams, I treated this as kind of an audition as to how far he has progressed since his Felicity days and if he's worthy of attempting Star Wars (I take that brand extremely seriously). Abrams definitely did not disappoint as he mixes heavy emotion with plenty of action, a slight pitch of comedy, and an abundance of twists and surprises. Lastly, there are so many nods to previous Star Trek movies that it nearly makes Into Darkness a bit predictable—which will be forgiven except by the thickest of true Trekkies.Star Trek Into Darkness will please fans, will please non-fans, will please newcomers, will please fans of special effects (Which were phenomenal), and ultimately will please those looking for the great blockbuster. This movie improves upon the original reboot in many facets and doesn't pull any punches. J.J. Abrams has taken Star Trek and has evolved it into more of a cult franchise, but one that is more inviting to newcomers and non-believers. Once the shock and thrills of the final act leaves the bloodstream, you will realize just how good a package Into Darkness truly is.",8,4,15,17 May 2013
The Notebook," I...am a man! Must....not....cry....*snif*....*snif*
","Everyone has been in love at least once in their lives, so why on earth is it difficult to craft a respectable love story? Over the years, it becomes harder and harder to find a good film about love and all its consequences. Even Titanic, the ultimate chick flick, is a disaster for multiple reasons. The romantic drama is a genre with a bad reputation because the genre always gets riddled with movies full of clichés, predictability, bad acting, bad dialogue, and the inability to tug at your emotions. For every Beauty and the Beast, you have three terrible romantic movies. For every Ghost, Sleepless in Seattle, Princess Bride, you have dozens of monstrosities. Enter The Notebook. The Notebook is a successful adaptation of a best-selling book by Nicholas Sparks, who is also responsible for A Walk to Remember and Message in a Bottle (the man apparently knows how to appeal to the females). Becoming strongly notorious for bringing out the lovey-dovey in every couple and even more notorious for emotionally destroying females everywhere, The Notebook easily stands as one of the greatest romantic films within the past decade. Becoming everything Titanic wishes it was, this movie is coupled with excellent acting, good dialogue, nicely woven plots, good direction, and good cinematography. Equipped with a good score, nice jazz songs, and a satisfactory ending, this movie will reach out for your heart and will force you to hold a box of tissues throughout the two hours. The surprise success comes with very good reason, for it is a movie that all of those losing faith in love should watch. We all know how difficult love is, especially nowadays in this seemingly cruel and twisted world. It is actually two stories in one. The first is an elderly man named Duke reading a book to this seemingly depressed elderly woman by the name of Allie who looks like she just wants to spend the rest of her life away from everyone else. The story Duke is reading is about a couple (Noah and Allie) whom have to separate after a perfect summer because of differing futures, the parents of the girl, and their social class differences. Both of them move on, but neither of the two ever wants to move past their love for each other; even when they are seen with other people living different lives. The ultimate test occurs when one of the two is actually about to marry. The Notebook switches between the story and what is going on with Duke and Allie. What keeps this movie fresh and different from the others is that it's actually two stories in one, and both are equally heartbreaking and touching. While it could have benefited from releasing more details about certain elements in the movie, the screenplay was excellent and moved at a respectable pace; all thanks to Jan Sardi and Jeremy Laden. Directing and acting are the two strongest portions of the movie. Nick Cassavetes (Alpha Dog, John Q) does a wonderful job progressing the story without being too slow, or too fast. He focuses less on the physical aspects of the relationships and more on the dialogue, more on the emotional aspects, which is a rarity and ends up portraying a much more realistic couple. Complimenting the directing is the cinematography, which shows some beautiful scenery, most notably a scene at a lake full of elegant birds. Rachel MacAdams and Ryan Gosling seem pretty much meant for each other. Their passion towards each other, and their anger towards the cruelty of the environment around them is nearly flawless; every line is delivered well and never crosses into cheesy. The supporting cast is also delightful, most particularly James Garner as the very friendly and patient Duke. Many themes of love are explored here: which includes never forgetting your first love, how love can and will prevail through all obstacles, and how love brings out the best and the worst in you. From the mental and physical breakdown of Noah in the later years to the bitterness that follows the mysterious Allie, love can build you up and tear you apart in a matter of seconds. A major rarity shown in The Notebook is that love is imperfect, and that is shown through the constant arguing between the main characters in the story. Finally, The Notebook isn't as predictable as other romantic flicks, even though they did drop far too many clues and the ending is revealed before it can come and shock you. Nonetheless, the movie ends in a very bittersweet note, so save plenty of tissue paper for the final scene. Bottom Line: Instant classic romantic movie, because they are so hard to find. When you find a movie that can make you smile, cry, waste tissue paper, and hold your loved one for moments longer afterwards, you've found a good movie. The Notebook has very few flaws, it is indeed a very good movie. The love amongst the main characters is far from cheesy and clichéd. This along with Eternal Sunshine (excellent 2004 romantic drama, totally recommend) stands as the perfect 1-2 romantic drama punch of the decade; they are the best love stories in recent years. A package of good acting, good writing, good directing, and good musical score makes this a must-own if you love these kinds of movies. Breathing some life into the dying genre, The Notebook succeeds as a total tear-jerker; whether you are a male or a female, whether you are single or taken, and whether you have a heart or not.",8,1,4,3 October 2007
Madagascar," Surprisingly good, not the typical pop-culture filled Dreamworks film
","Dreamworks I feared was losing it after back-to-back disappointments Shrek 2 and Shark Tale. Then came the trailer of the movie Madagascar and I was even more afraid. I was so sure that this one was going to just be another pop-culture filled borefest. Apparently, Dreamworks proved me totally wrong. Madagascar, no joke, is the best Dreamworks animated film since the instant classic Shrek. This movie did something that not Shrek 2, Shark Tale, and not even The Incredibles pulled off, which was a great mix of drama, pop culture references, and sight gags. As a matter of fact, Madagascar is run by sight gags and visual jokes, which is a good thing. The end result is a movie that will entertain both kids and adults, and more the kids but the adults will get a kick out of this anyway.Madagascar is about a zebra, a giraffe, a lion, and a hippo being transferred to the wild after an escape from the New York Central Zoo, which was started by a zebra that wanted nothing more than to experience the wild and do something different. But, because of a couple of penguins who look like have seen way too many criminal/heist films and also because of an argument, the animals were instead moved to a remote island full of little furry creatures that are constantly threatened by meat-eaters. Throughout the movie, the animals struggle to adapt to the wild as the animals in the island have other plans for them. Ben Stiller voices the lion, Alex, and actually does a superb job as well. Unlike his previous film Meet the Fockers, he does not depend on the other characters surrounding him to become funny, his performance as the lion is funny by itself.Sorry you Chris Rock fans, but I find this comedian rather overrated. That being said, Chris Rock was very funny as Marty the zebra, he delivers some of the better one-liners in the film. David Schwimmer is my favorite of the Friends actors and actresses and this is just another reason why he can have a decent career outside of the hit sitcom. His performance is the best, as the very paranoid and unhealthy giraffe Melman. Last but not least of the main characters, Jada Pinkeet Smith (who hasn't done much lately) does a swell job as the hippo, Gloria. Of course, I have to give credit to Cedric the Entertainer and Sacha Baron Cohen (better known as Ali G) for their funny performances as well. But it is not the dialogue that runs this film, it is the penguins, the sight gags, and the cute critters from the island of Madagascar that make this film worth watching more than one time. The penguins have the best lines in the film, and they barely say anything. They are four very determined and intelligent penguins simply trying to go to Antarctica. As for the cute critters, you just have to see them; they are simply a wild bunch.Like most Dreamworks animated films, Madagascar also relies on the pop culture references, but not even close as much as their previous movies, and that is a good thing. What is even better is that they are actually funny. Ranging from American Beauty, Planet of the Apes, The Twilight Zone, to even a 1960s drug reference, the allusions come very fast, and if you catch them, the payoff is great. Like Robots, the movie is mostly visually appealing, but for a different reason than Robots. The visual entertainment in Robots is just jaw dropping, not really entertaining, just amazing to look at. Madagascar is uproarious with the amount of visual humor it has to offer, at times, you just sit back and marvel at the effort they put in order to make you laugh without using a single line of dialogue (once again, I am referring to the penguins).Bottom Line: Unlike the Pixar films, Madagascar does not dig very deep into sentimental value, it is just the typical kids film, with plenty to look and laugh at. I find this film much better than Shrek 2, Shark Tale, and even Antz, the movie that put Dreamworks computer animation on the map. As a matter of fact, aside from Kung Fu Hustle, this is my favorite film of the year, and yes, it is much better than the disappointing and plot hole-filled fiasco Star Wars: Episode 3 (but no, I am not including Sin City because I have not seen it yet). Better than A Bug's Life but, still far off of the quality of Pixar films, but then again, few movies can top Pixar films. Full of decent performances from the well-known actors and actress, which is a rarity nowadays in animation, Madagascar just proved to us why companies pay good money to hire famous actors to lend their voices. Good voice acting, plenty of funny jokes, and endless physical humor make this film a must-see for the entire family, for those especially sick of all the hype for that other film. Have fun at Madagascar; you'll be surprised at just how pleasant it is.Score: 8/10",8,1,1,11 June 2005
Ice Age: The Meltdown," Scrat takes this film and runs with it, the other characters in the film just get in the way
","Ice Age was proof that you do not have to be Pixar to come out with an awesome yet equally touching computer-animated film. Becoming a surprise hit a few years ago, it made Ray Romano a bigger star, and would also temporarily revive the careers of Denis Leary and John Leguizamo. Of course a sequel was in the works after its success, this is Hollywood we are talking about. Fortunately, the entire cast was back, including the squirrel that provided the most laughs in the original. The antics of the squirrel are among the best footage of animation since the Road Runner cartoonshe is just that funny to watch. Unfortunately though, Queen Latifah was going to have her moments in the sequel. The overrated actress just isn't that funny, sorry, and I did not picture her providing much laughs in the movie.Ice Age: The Meltdown is one of those movies that feel more like two movies in one: one that is very, very funny, and the other that just isn't that great at all. Scrat the squirrel basically proved that he needs his own movie; he was the standout character in the film by far. Ice Age: The Meltdown also proves that once you add a few more characters, the chemistry between the main characters just suffers. In the original Ice Age, there were plenty of one-liners, witty remarks, and cheap shots aimed at each other, but in the sequel, it's all gone because we have another mammoth and a few possums. It just wasn't as interesting the second time around, nor was it as funny. Ice Age: The Meltdown is the standard sequel, more or less of the same but just not as equally fun.The movie is about how the ice is melting and it will soon create a massive flood, leading to the possible deaths of thousands of animals. With this looming event happening, Manny, Sid, and Diego set out on a hunt to find a protection, or perhaps a 'boat' to save them from the icy cold waters and the dangerous fishes that lurk within it. Along the way, they run into the possums and perhaps the only other living mammoth. The catch is, the female mammoth thinks she is a possum herself. The other part of the movie, the second part, is Scrat's constant efforts into getting that acorn he so adores.Pretty much all the humor comes from Scrat, and nobody else. Sure the main characters do have their moments, but overall all the humor comes from the Looney Tunes-style moments of the squirrel and all he has to go through to get the acorn. Whether its him going all kung fu on fishes, or attempting an Olympic-like stunt, or climbing using his tongue, the furry critter does it all. He stands out like a hysterical sore thumb in the film. He needs his own movie; this is a fact. It would be the most successful animated film with no dialogue whatsoever (Hey, you won't have to pay millions to hire famous actors).Madagascar, Ice Age, and especially Finding Nemo were three animated films that were totally run by the chemistry between the main characters, the way they cooperated and clashed with each other. This film was totally missing that. The mammoths just didn't seem like that great of a couple, Sid and Diego was missing that comical spark, Manny didn't have as many good one-liners, and the rest of the animals they run into just weren't as funny (The Dodos from the first one was a hoot). Crash, Eddie, and Ellie, the three new animals in the sequel, just made the movie drag a bit and rarely provided anything past a snicker from the audience.The voice talent isn't to blame here as much as the writing. Romano, Leary, Leguizamo were great with what they had, while Seann William Scott, Queen Latifah, and Josh Peck weren't necessarily that greatanyone really could have done those roles. It seems like the writers did not have enough material the second time around but did the best they could to make the movie despite the lack of content. The jokes just aren't as fresh, and some of them come off as uncomfortably pathetic. The ending was awesome though, and once again, its because of Scrat.Bottom Line: Not as fresh, not as original, not as exciting, not as funny, and not as entertaining as the first one, but it still does indeed have its moments, and they all involve the one headline character in the teasers and in the poster. Hopefully, a third one is not going to happen, but with the money this one is currently making, the possibility is still indeed there. Chemistry is all gone, the laughs aren't there; this was the most disappointing animated film since Shrek 2. Then again, with Pixar headlining the way animated films should be, shouldn't we cut Blue Sky Studios a little bit of slack? After the excellent Ice Age, nah, the talent is obviously there, that or they are a one-hit wonder (after all, Robots wasn't that great either). Ice Age: The Meltdown: all we need is Scrat.6/10",6,5,6,23 April 2006
Ted," Family Gu--er, Seth MacFarlane finally makes his big screen debut
","If you are not a Family Guy fan then stop reading and leave immediately.If you are easily offended by crude, offensive, racial jokes stop reading and leave immediately.If you are going to attempt to figure out why there is a talking teddy bear and nobody seems to care then stop reading and leave immediately.Ted is basically a live-action spin of the Family Guy school of humor---full of obscure and blatant references, full of absurd and ridiculous humor, subtle satire and finally even a little bit of heart (Although only the first two seasons of Family Guy contained such a thing). Just like the show, the plot and premise is very simple—the draw is all that happens within the timeframe; that's what keeps you entertained. And Ted fits this billing too.Basically Ted is about a man whose inability to grow up stems from his continued relationship with a teddy bear turned to life during his childhood. All in all it's an adult fairy tale, with all the crass jokes, dialogue, and insanity that you usually get from your R-rated frat pack comedies. Except this time the humor gets flung at you in massive clusters at a rapid ADD pace that may prevent you from breathing at times—while at other times you are just begging for them to throw a new funny sequence.This movie feels so much like Family Guy and not just because it's from the same writer/director and contains the same types of jokes as the cult hit---a good portion of the staff can be seen/heard here. Mila Kunis, Patrick Warburton, Seth MacFarlane himself (voicing the bear with a Peter Griffin accent), and even the musical score comes from the same composer as the show (Walter Murphy).To sum this up nicely, if you enjoy (and can tolerate) the Family Guy brand and the times they do miss their jokes, then there's no reason why you couldn't enjoy this. While the third act really bogged down the entire picture with a boring subplot that actually bares minimal continuity to the first half, I can't deny it's a fun ride and a great debut from Seth MacFarlane.Let's be serious, any movie with a dozen Flash Gordon references has to be entertaining.",7,7,17,30 June 2012
Spider-Man 2," It is not the typical sequel, it actually makes you forget that there was a part 1 of Spider-Man
","Spider-Man 2 is the best movie this year so far. The last time I saw a movie this good was last year when I went to watch Finding Nemo. As a matter of fact, Spider-Man 2 beats ALL superhero movies of this decade and the 90s. To be more specific, the last time a superhero movie was done so well is the instant classic Batman, and SM2 even outperforms that movie at certain times. Spider-Man 2 improved on the original in every way possible, it took the formula that made the first one a hit and tweaked on it much more to create a masterpiece of writing, acting, and special effects. So much happens in this movie, there was never a dull moment, and most of the time, you will be at the edge of your seat. Derived from a clever and very strong plot, a whole lot happens in the movie. The plot includes the fact that Harry Osborn is still hunting after Spider-Man, and also investing money in one of Dr. Otto Octavius's experiments, who turns out to be the main villain in the movie. Meanwhile, Mary Jane is being a successful model and is also an actress that is getting angrier and angrier at the fact that she can barely see Peter Parker. Not only that, but Mary Jane is also planning on getting married to an astronaut. In the meantime, Peter Parker continues struggling mixing his day life with his two friends and his aunt, with his nightlife as Spider-Man. So much happens, you wonder how all this manages to fit into just 125 minutes. This plot is the reason why the movie stays fresh and exciting throughout the entire time. Spider-Man 2 has much more humor the 2nd time around, much more romance and tear-jerking moments, more action, and much more moments that would make you jump out of your seat. The funniest character in the movie is Peter Parker's boss, which is the bossy, mean, not-too-smart, manipulative and just plain awful J. Jonah Jameson. The standout funny scenes in the movie are any scene with Jameson and also a hysterical scene in an elevator involving Spider-Man and a stranger. Mary Jane and Harry, despite still being major roles in Peter Parker's life, are not around as much in the movie, but they are in many major scenes anyway.The acting was excellent; everyone did his or her part wonderfully. Tobey Maguire did a good job as the strong yet tired and vulnerable Peter Parker/Spider-Man. Kirsten Dunst played the beautiful Mary Jane with plenty of emotion and James Franco does the angry and unsure Henry Osborn. J.K. Simmons gives perhaps the best performance of the movie as J. Jonah Jameson. The main villain (Awesome performance by Alfred Molina), even though gets less screen time than The Green Goblin from the original Spider-Man, offers up a lot more scares and a couple of awesome fights against Spider-Man. The Green Goblin had 3 fights against Spider-Man, two minor, and one major. Dr. Otto has three fights against Spider-Man, 2 of them phenomenally awesome fights, and one smaller and shorter fight. One last note, I must applaud in Rosemary Harris's wonderful performance as Aunt May.The fight scenes were much, much, much, much better the second time around. The fights are not only longer, but have much more action, much more awe-inspiring little moments in the fight, and are in a much larger range. What I mean by the range is that the fight takes a lot more room, a lot more space. While the fights in the original Spider-Man are in a building or a burning apartment, the fights in the sequel take place at first in a bank and then goes up to a huge building, and then the best fight of all involves the top of a clock tower, and then heads on to a runaway train [Which is the best fight I have seen in years, I may add]. What separates this superhero movie from the other superhero movies is that it does an awesome job of mixing the romance, comedy, action, and jaw-dropping moments so that it appeals to every single person wanting to watch it. The ending reveals so much; I cannot really discuss much about it. In some parts it will shock you, in some parts it may disappoint, and last of all, it keeps you asking for more, hours after the movie is finished. It was fantastic, in my opinion, and it will appeal to a lot more people than the original. The sequel stays very close to its comic book roots and does an excellent job with the special effects. Bottom Line: Fantastic movie. Despite perhaps the ending at one point, which I should not reveal much of, this movie will not disappoint at all. It was truly worth all the hype, and is the most exciting, most rewarding, and funniest, and best movie of the year. It was more action packed than all action films out now, it is funnier than most comedies out this decade [cough*Shrek 2*cough], and because of the great close-ups and brilliant acting, I find this one of the more emotionally-moving films out there today. I was impressed, and I am waiting for part 3 already. The only thing that part 1 has the advantage of is perhaps the villain, I really did enjoy seeing the Green Goblin, but besides that, the original is nothing compared to this. Go see Spider-Man 2, now, it is a crime to not watch and experience this movie. Final Score: 9.5 /10 [A]",10,3,3,30 June 2004
Superbad," It is not Super, nor is it Bad, but like High School it seems like it never ends.
","The return of the R-rated comedies is reaching full force, as we now have a new group of actors that's giving the Frat Pack some competition. Starting with the short-lived television shows 'Freaks and Geeks' and 'Undeclared;' Judd Apatow, Seth Rogan, and a slew of other buddies have emerged from the shade and into the spotlight with consecutive hits. Already with one summer success under their belt (Knocked Up), the crew has decided to take on the R-rated High School genre. This genre doesn't see much success, with movies like American Pie becoming an exception to the rule. Nonetheless, with its inability to hold back punches and amazing amount of energy and chemistry amongst the actors and actresses, Superbad looks like a hit from a mile away. While this movie does indeed deliver more laughs than the American Pie films, it's still far from perfect. The movie drags, there isn't much content underneath the vulgarity and jaw-dropping moments, and it lacks the emotion and chemistry from previous hits 'Knocked Up' and 'The 40-Year-Old Virgin.' But if you are looking for a raunchy good time, then look no further, because Superbad is quite a naughty little flick.Superbad follows two high school friends that are about to separate once the semester is over. Seth (Jonah Hill) is a vulgar, unsympathetic, foul-mouthed, and sex-starved class clown; while his best friend Evan (Michael Cera) is a shy nice guy who has strong feelings for the pretty Becca (Martha MacIsaac). Together, they will try to score with their current crushes by joining a party and promising alcohol---with the help of the nerdy and antisocial Fogell (Christopher Mintz-Plasse). Along the way they will not only run into a bunch of quirky and sometimes dangerous scenarios, but it will also unleash the vent-up anger that all three have towards each other. Written by Seth Rogan and Evan Goldberg, these two know how to incorporate high school anxieties and fears and embarrassments without the movie feeling clichéd. What makes Superbad so fresh and unique is that it does not fear offending nor does it fear potentially grossing the audience out. In here we get some really raw dialogue, graphic imagery, and plenty of gross-out humor. Taking place over the course of one evening, Superbad follows in the footsteps of previous high school classics like American Graffiti.Superbad is funny, no question, there are plenty of wonderful one-liners and funny moments (especially in the first act). Yet going past the humor, it lacks the heart that classic high school movies contain. Also it doesn't help that our main character is a bit of a jerk. Why Seth and Evan are together is a bit questionable considering that Seth usually has nothing good to say, and Evan has nothing but a pure good heart and admirable qualities. The black sheep of the trip is Fogell, whose appearance with the other two is also questionable considering the lack of decent treatment he gets. The audience winds up rooting for Fogell in the end of the movie, not really Seth (Or it could be because he's actually McLovin, like the previews showed). What keeps Superbad afloat is actually the well-written story, as the impossibility of accomplishing their mission becomes more and more present as the third act approaches. This movie steers in many unique directions, and becomes quite unpredictable.Greg Mottola, not Judd Apatow like the commercials make it seem, is running the show. In the director chair, he limits the improvising and focuses more on the story. That's what makes Superbad less of a quotable movie than previous adult comedies, yet maintains stability---until the end. The third act practically runs out of steam, as it looks like they didn't quite know how to end the movie. Instead, we are received with an ending that leaves out characters for the last several minutes, and doesn't quite feel complete. You need a feel-good ending in these types of films, and it just wasn't delivered here.Bottom Line: Superbad isn't an instant classic, nor is it a disappointing disaster. Instead, it's a decent flick with its issues and problems. The ending wasn't great, the main characters doesn't incite sympathy or support from the viewers, the running time felt a bit long, and it doesn't help that it has to follow-up to gems like recent adult comedies 40-Year-Old Virgin, Knocked Up, Wedding Crashers, and Harold and Kumar. The writing, directing, and editing were fine up until the very end, when they didn't quite know how to finish the picture. The acting was good, but the characters they were portraying just weren't that interesting(with the exception of McLovin). The genre has very few true classics and complete films, so despite the setbacks this still stands as one of the better high school comedies in recent years. Going with friends would definitely enhance the experience, as you all can relive the good ol' days of high school and the embarrassing moments that follow.",6,8,17,20 August 2007
X-Men Origins: Wolverine," Missing the 'Ommph' of the first two X-Men movies, and missing a decent interpretation of the X-Men
","The X-Men franchise has been riding on the backbone of Wolverine since the very beginning. Hugh Jackman's interpretation of the popular hero made him a major star and the character the frontrunning character of the long-running comic book series. After the mildly controversial Last Stand, 20th Century Fox decides to turn back the clock and focus all their attention on the lead character for an entire movie. Wolverine is the first of potentially many to receive his own movie, his own chance to truly shine. Now, hardcore readers and newcomers can see how he rose from outcast to killing machine. The end result is a totally mixed bag, however, and it boils down to just how hardcore a fan you really are.If you are hardcore, then you'll most likely receive the same cringing feeling when watching the same movie studio pretty much mercilessly butcher Dragonball into nearly unrecognizable form. Otherwise, you might have a semi-decent time granted you can get past the inconsistent special effects and rather jumbled finale. One would wonder why on earth they skipped past Bryan Singer and even Brett Ratner to hand the director's seat to a man known for drama. One would also wonder why they didn't use the same writers from previous X-Men flicks. Now, this review will tread off into two different paragraphs; one dedicated to the hardcore, one dedicated to the casual.Hardcore: Prepare to cry. Gambit, easily one of the coolest comic book characters out there, becomes amazingly watered-down and barely is used. Deadpool's look is absolutely different from his comic book counterpart, and is reduced to cameo screen time. As a matter of fact, despite it being a Wolverine movie, the entire film loses a lot of quality when compared to the X-Men movies because of the majority of the heroes and villains sharing such little time on screen. And when they are shown, they don't really resemble the ensemble we are used to seeing.Casual: The film is a mixed bag in everything. The acting, the pacing, the directing, the editing, the music, the special effects all range from decent to mediocre to even terrible throughout the two hours. The fights themselves aren't very lengthy, and there aren't as many action pieces as one would hope. Jackman definitely isn't to blame here, but he has a tough task of carrying a film that can never quite lift off the ground. Maybe it's because it has to live up to the amazing comic book cinematic one-two punch of last year (Iron Man, Dark Knight). Whatever the reason, Wolverine doesn't quite entertain or overwhelm as much as the better comic book flicks.Bottom Line: Don't expect the greatness of last year, or even X2 for that matter. The film does have its moments, does have its fun moments. However, the film doesn't appeal well to the hardcore and it doesn't fully explain the mannerisms and history of Wolverine, our famed hero. X-Men works best when the diverse cast of characters share equally good screen time with each other, and it definitely doesn't happen here. Butchered characters also hinder the experience.",5,2,6,4 May 2009
Hot Fuzz," With a collage of wit, action, comedy and horror, Hot Fuzz is a funtastic spoof of a genre known for its over-the-top behavior
","The average American knows what an American action film is. It usually consists of throwaway plots, buddy/partner relationships, pointless sex scenes, amazing amounts of profanity, explosions, and more explosions. Of course, it gets dabbed from time to time with humor and some random romance story that has little correlation with the main plot. Of course, not ALL action films fall into this, but most do. It is a genre that has really good films (The Rock, Con Air, Die Hard, Speed, The Rundown), really bad films (Bad Boys II, Lethal Weapon 4, 2 Fast 2 Furious) and then some that are just downright ugly (Beverly Hills Cop 3, Double Team, Biker Boyz, Simon Sez). Now, we have the British creative staff behind the cult classic Shawn of the Dead providing us with their take on the genre that has garnished a lot of money but has established itself with a reputation of being mere mindless popcorn entertainment. What winds up happening is exactly like what happened with Shawn of the Dead: the spoof/satire/homage to the genre its portraying winds up becoming one of the best of its kind, better than most released recently.Hot Fuzz excels as an action film because of its funny build-up, its quite intriguing story, its ability to stay on track, excellent chemistry amongst the actors, and of course, plenty of gruesome action to sink your teeth into. Carrying the formula that propelled Shawn of the Dead, Hot Fuzz entertains you, throws you off with its plot twists, and then has you on the edge of your seat when the action picks up. It does not contain any romance or pointless sex scenes, but that's instead replaced by a dosage of horror and mystery. The pacing is fast and furious, and refuses to slow down. The references come flying (some obvious, some vague) from all directions, and then it even ends like an action filmso plug in the ears if you don't like a lot of noise.In this over-the-top spoof, we follow Nicholas Angel, (Simon Pegg) a top-notch police officer that is re-assigned because he is making everyone else look bad. That was pretty much established right from the beginning of the film. Next thing you know, he is in a rather secluded, clean, and seemingly happy town by the name of Sandford. Right from the get go Nicholas seems to be a bit paranoid and creeped-out about the mannerisms of the town, as he tries to teach the dim-witted but reliable partner Danny Butterman (Nick Frost). Angel's suspicious rises as a series of accidents hamper the town. Nonetheless, despite the overwhelming evidence and logic he uses, the rest of the police department isn't convinced.Following the same choppy-edited quick cuts from Shawn of the Dead, Edgar Wright does a fantastic job keeping the speed of the film fast, while leaving plenty of details, Easter eggs, and hints as to what is going to happen next. Adding to his fantastic direction are the funny visuals that can be seen in the background as the subjects in front of the camera engage in conversation. But even with the hints intact, you still don't know where the story is going, and that is thanks to the writing staff (Pegg, again, and Wrightagain). Hot Fuzz is actually a lot less predictable than Shawn of the Deadits also not as funny, but much more action-oriented.We have quite a talented staff in Hot Fuzz that extends from the creative staff to the actors. Besides the hilarious and likable Pegg and Frost, we also have Bill Nighy, Timothy Dalton, Paul Freeman, Stuart Wilson, and the Oscar-winner Jim Broadbent. While you may not know these names as well as the major Hollywood actors of today, just know that you won't get the typical stomach-churning acting present in the average action film. Hot Fuzz spends most of the movie building up using comical scenes, moments of suspense and terror; and then blows the doors down in the final moments. With a long, funny, yet satisfying shootout, a grand car chase, a tense final fight, and explosions left and right, the third act more than makes for its lack of gunfire and pyrotechnics in the first two parts of the movie.Bottom Line: While referencing and giving nods to Die Hard, Point Break, Bad Boys, Lethal Weapon, and other superb action flicks, Hot Fuzz becomes among the better action flicks in recent memory. With a plot that actually works, characters are actually dimensional, and with content that is actually smart, this film is over-the-top, gory, but maintains the quality whether blood is spewing onto the screen or not. It may require multiple viewings to actually catch all the references, but with a film this good, you won't mind. It is funny, gory, and out-of-control. The British team behind Shawn of the Dead does it again; only this time hopefully more Americans will take notice of an emerging quality force across the Atlantic Ocean. Here comes the Fuzz.",10,4,7,22 April 2007
500 Days of Summer," The Charlie Brown of love tales, 500 Days of Summer is a cruelly charming and realistic look at unrequited love
","I was angry at the characters. I was angry at the way the story was progressing. I was angry because I knew of the gloom and doom that was approaching. I was angry, because, I had been there, experienced that all before. I was angry because I didn't want to see it happen to someone else. That's exactly why 500 Days of Summer works as a heart-wrenching, soul-slamming romantic dramedy. This film is realistic, funny, charming, bubbly, and just a fantastic example of superb low-budget directing complimenting the low-budget writing. The movie is also utterly realistic and cleverly original, and becomes one of the better films of 2009.In this soul-draining non-love story, we follow Tom Hansen (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) as he tries to pick up the pieces of his broken heart and figure out why his on-off girlfriend (Zooey Deschanel) does not ultimately return the undeniable love he has for her. The film goes in a totally non-linear format, resembling the jumbled-yet-well-structured storytelling style of Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. 500 Days of Summer never just presents the story either, there is a song-and-dance routine, a few documentary-like scenes, and even an extremely clever split-screen moment that has the expectations of Tom, and the actual reality that results. Bitterly written by Scott Neustadter and Michael H. Weber, it's obvious they brought personal experiences to the table. Only real life can craft such cruel moments.Chemistry is what can make or break a romantic comedy. In this case, it's not only adorable and sensual, but it's downright real to the core. Gordon-Levitt and Deschanel deserve acting nominations for their work, because the chemistry they had together oozes all over the film in ways not seen often in the last decade. They are not two big major stars with epic looks falling for each other, they are down-to-earth individuals that became caught up in an awkward relationship, and their sensible mannerisms enhanced the charm and realism of the entire production. Zooey Deschanel doesn't have the Hollywood look, but her portrayal of Summer pretty much forces you to fall for her just as bad as Tom does.Marc Webb, a somewhat-accomplished music video director, absolutely excels in his first feature film. He takes all the little quirks and fun techniques that are usually employed to short music videos, and sprinkles them all over the 95 minutes of seeing a relationship rise and fall. Just like Michael Gondry and Spike Jonze, the music video experience allows for him to think outside the box in presenting a cinematic story, resulting in a very original experience in terms of visuals. The best example of great direction in this movie is the superb expectation/reality sequence halfway in. And just like Jonze and Gondry, he can also catch emotion and heartbreak just as well as the most experienced. You are smiling when they are at their best, and on the verge of an emotional breakdown when you see them are their lowest. And with the roller coaster-like structure, the audience is never allowed to remain too happy or too sad for too long.The narrator in the film from the very beginning warns that it is not a love tale. This couldn't be any closer to the truth. It's a gut-wrenching story, and it is a tale that we all experience. Finding what we think is The One, only to see her (or him) slipping away in favor of someone else. And like I said before (in a subtle manner), this movie avoids the Hollywood clichés and does deliver on its hurtful promises. You don't see a happy ending in the distance, yet yearn for one.Where the movie hits the toughest note is the third act. For a movie that takes its time in presenting the highs and lows of the relationship, we are left with a very empty conclusion. Not all the questions were answered, and not all is explained. In a film that runs so deep in the beginning, it's rather disappointing to hit shallow waters towards the end. But maybe this is the intention. Are we ever meant to truly understand why something doesn't work? Are there cases in which there is no explanation, it's just that the relationship just never 'clicked?' Can we ever truly learn from a failed relationship that has an abrupt ending? Just like Tom and Summer in the beginning of the movie, our connection with the film and the relationship suddenly gets cut off with no explanation, leading to an ending that rushes right in. Maybe it is our personal duty to dwell, to learn, to figure it out, and to move on with the knowledge intact. I never see myself being satisfied at an abrupt ending (See: No Country For Old Men), but 500 Days of Summer gets the pass because the film itself is such a satisfying and practical representation of our relationships with people—even when we are not ready for the end.Bottom Line: 500 Days of Summer is a beautiful film, no doubt about it. It's a brutally realistic story and an overall overwhelmingly charming experience that takes us through the highs and lows in life when sharing them with that current special someone. Besides the questionable ending, this movie has very few flaws thanks to excellent direction, excellent chemistry, and writing that sting the heartstrings like needles. If you are trying to mend new (or old) wounds (*raises hand*), this is the right film to watch to begin (or continue) the healing process. This film is not a love story, but it is indeed a story to fall in love with. Highly recommend.",9,0,0,9 January 2010
Juno," Things that make you go 'Awwwwwwwwww' Volume #665221
","Back in 2007, a little Indie flick rises from the ashes of obscurity and finds its way into the underground pop culture. A small yet charming little story about a 16-year-old giving away the baby still inside her womb won the hearts of audiences and critics across the entire globe. Even the story behind the making of the story was something else, as Diablo Cody, an ex-stripper works her way up from humble beginnings as a well-known blogger. But, with every grand film that makes a surprising amount of money, comes the backlash. The screams of 'overrated,' 'not that great,' 'Propaganda,' among other lashes have been hitting this film, and hard. So is Juno a film that was riding a wave of praise that suddenly crashes after the hype is gone? Or is it actually a decent film? I've had my share of being in the backlash end of highly-praised and lower-budgeted independent movies like Sideways, Little Miss Sunshine, and especially (especially) Napoleon Dynamite. However, Juno doesn't quite fit the mold with the other movies previously mentioned. The story is indeed unique, the characters and their reactions are definitely different, and the script (despite unrealistic dialogue) is spectacular in its ability to blind you from what's happening next. While the morality, themes, and decisions are definitely up for debate and may find you cursing the screen, Juno is one of those little movies that can actually deliver. Few times can a movie run on purely amazing acting, but Juno has easily the best acting ensemble of 2007 and among the best this decade.You should all know the story by now: Juno (Ellen Page) sleeps with her best friend (Michael Cera) and of course, winds up pregnant. However, the story twists in another direction because Juno decides to give up the baby to a couple (Jennifer Garner and Jason Bateman) the second it is born, no questions asked. The rest of the movie deals with the struggles (emotional mostly, rarely do we see the physical side effects) Juno and her closest people face as the baby is one step closer to arriving in the real world. While Juno pursues the right ending to the ordeal, the conflict complicates itself, and emotions start running on overdrive at all the wrong moments.One major complaint is about how easy Juno treats her pregnancy. To the observant eye, you can see that Juno hides her emotional stress underneath her sarcasm and bitter tone. This is the strongest and weakest point of Juno: the writing. The script itself contains layers upon layers of great dialogue, subtle themes, smart surprises, and wraps up the whole piece nicely by the end. However, there is such thing as a script being too smart and trying too hard, and Diablo Cody wrote herself into a corner. Juno herself is interesting, spunky, smart, but too smart for her own good. It is almost impossible for a 16-year-old to be able to have any sort of knowledge of the first punk movement in 1979, especially when it seems like she is the only one in her social circle that even knows of this. Her constant pop culture references are to things that existed way before she was born; her usage of words is much too strong for someone her age. Everyone else in the movie is believable, but Juno herself is sometimes too over-the-top.While Juno is unbelievable, Ellen Page is not. Ellen Page does a great job portraying the sly main character, as she can also shed layers of emotion much like the script. However, we cannot forget the incredible performances of J.K. Simmons, Allison Janney, Michael Cera, and best of all Jennifer Garner. The persistence of Vanessa in the movie is perfectly done by Garner, who should at least have gotten some sort of Oscar nod. The acting carries this movie, and gives it a heavy dosage of realism and gritty passion that you will not find in the typical Hollywood flick. The movie tugs at your heart as the final act rolls around and we see everyone trying to be at their strongest spiritually.Bottom Line: The backlash comes mostly from those who don't truly understand Juno. Juno isn't trying to beat a message about abortion over your head, its trying to give you a charming and distinctive tale about having to face maturity several years too soon. Juno was forced to 'grow up,' albeit temporarily, because an 'adult' event is occurring in her teenage life. Yes, her decisions may seem a bit strange, right from the getgo, but that's who Juno is. If we can accept a man killing people while wearing a mask resembling a clown, why can't we accept a teenager that enjoys moving furniture from inside her home to the front yard of someone else's? With that said, its not the best script in years, like the Hollywood underground was saying. The movie was too smart, Juno was too smart, and relied a bit too much on pop culture. It's like Family Guy, except with actual heart and no randomness whatsoever. Diablo Cody obviously has the talent, now she has to tweak upon her mistakes made here. Juno is entertaining, will deliver laughs, is highly-quotable, and has a delightful little ending. You just want to hug this movie with all its cuteness. This movie is a bit on the overrated end, but isn't disappointing, unlike the average indie flick riding praise waves. If you want a different motion picture experience, I recommend Juno.",7,3,9,31 July 2008
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," If you've liked the series so far, you are in for yet another treat.
","Decent third installments are just as hard to come by as decent sequels. Nonetheless, At World's End becomes one of those few exceptions to the rule. Combining an engrossing storyline, excellent visuals, brilliant cinematography, superb acting, plenty of action, plenty of thrills, a lot of humor, and a fitting ending to conclude the trilogy, At World's End is sure to entertain and satisfy the fans of the first two installments. Also adding to the nice package of entertainment lies plenty of references to the ride (yet again), a good soundtrack that actually borrows from the great Ennio Morricone, and a humorous cameo from Keith Richards. However, if you don't like the franchise as of now, there is absolutely no reason to see this one, since it uses the same film structure recipe of the first two. Unlike previous third installments, this one does not disappoint, and delivers.The final chapter (supposedly) of this franchise follows Will (Orlando Bloom), Elizabeth (Keira Knightley), and the recently revived Capt. Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) and his crew as they attempt to bring back Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) for multiple reasons. In fact, each of them has a different agenda with Sparrow in mind. In the meanwhile, Lord Cutler Beckett has control of Davy Jones' heart, which allows for him to command the most powerful ship in the seas, threatening piracy once and for all. It is up for the remaining species of piracy to save themselves and the career of being a pirate. Taking place directly after the ending of Dead Man's Chest, At World's End starts off very quickly, following the very grim introduction. The cast and crew are back, in terms of acting and characters; some minor characters with much more screen time than before, resulting in more humorous moments. Like Dead Man's Chest, Jack Sparrow runs the show but is not the only show going on; we see plenty of Will, Elizabeth, the villains, and Barbossa.At World's End does not hold any punches throughout the movie. There are plenty of deaths, gruesome moments, and the introduction sets the tone for some of the events that are about to unfold. Death is one of the prominent themes in the film, as well as love, trust, loyalty, and honor. While it is not as action-packed as the previous two, it more than makes up for it with the final battle, which is jaw-dropping entertainment that could have gone forever and nobody would notice. The special effects, without joking, are some of the best ever displayed on film; if this doesn't win an Academy Award of any sort, there should be very little reason to ever trust the Academy again. The cinematography actually kicked it up a notch, with some beautiful scenery. One particular scene has the ship looking like it is sailing over the stars--absolutely gorgeous. We also have a very nice-looking but rather trippy sequence involving Jack Sparrow and his fate after death.Helping the magnificent special effects is the acting, which is above average for a popcorn flick. Johnny Depp and Geoffrey Rush rekindle their chemistry and tension shared in Curse of the Black Pearl, and their performances along with that of Bill Nighy remain the best of the trilogy and this movie. But, the others did well, most notably the varied and unique pirate crew, and Keira Knightley as she develops from damsel in distress to a true pirate right in front of our eyes. Director Gore Verbinski does a fantastic job keeping the movie entertaining even when the plots scattered all over the place crashes into each other. Verbinski also knows how to raise tension when the stakes are high, and handles the special effects shots well.The pacing and editing of At World's End is far superior to that of Dead Man's Chest, as despite it being a lengthier movie, it doesn't feel that way. There are very few moments of slowdown, and even within the moments of slowdown, there are humorous one-liners or acts of physical comedy to keep us awake and laughing, waiting for the next big plot turn. The relationship between Elizabeth and Will takes a step of importance forward here as the theme of love is in the air, and is the result for the rise and demise of the cast of characters in the film.The only problem with At World' End is that it does not offer anything different from the first two installments; in which it will not attract any haters of the previous two blockbuster hits. The formula remains the same as we see a slow build-up emerge into a powerhouse action flick. In terms of action trilogies, it resembles Indiana Jones the most because of its blend of action, adventure, humor, and romance. While it is no Indiana Jones, the Pirates trilogy easily is one of the best we've seen in decades. Consistently good and entertaining, this franchise is already and shall remain a staple of pop culture and 21st century cinema history.Bottom Line: Jack Sparrow and the rest are back, and in the final act maintain the entertainment value of the previous two, arguable even stepping it up a notch. The soundtrack, visual effects, special effects, and musical score are at its peak here, despite the storyline still paling in comparison to the original. The acting, pacing, editing and directing remain successful, even though it will not attract those disappointed or disgusted by Curse of the Black Pearl and/or Dead Man's Chest. There aren't enough popcorn flicks that deliver the complete package, and At World's End just leaves you thirsty for more, especially considering recent disappointments from other film franchises. It is a nice tale of the high seas full of action, suspense, comedy, drama, and romance. Highly recommend; grab some popcorn a huge soda, and sit down and enjoy the wild ride towards the end of the Earth.",8,2,3,26 May 2007
Spider-Man 3," What happens when you try too hard
","One of the toughest things to do in the world of today is to entertain and satisfy multiple types of crowds. Among the hardest to please includes the comic book studs. The comic book fans have different expectations from that of the rest of the mainstream. It is a difficult job to do, but the Spider-Man series at this point had done a fantastic job gratifying everybody. Combining excellent special effects, great acting, a wonderful script, and good direction; the Spider-Man films rank as among the best films based off comic books. Spider-Man 2 stands as the best of them all, even above Batman Begins and Superman. But, with the third installment looming and multiple plots being revealed, it was looking like a movie with a lot of content for something that's just 140 minutes.This is pretty much what makes and breaks Spider-Man 3; the sheer amount of things going on. Packing in way too much when it easily could convert into two films, Spider-Man 3 disappoints mildly because of lack of consistent pacing, lack of development, and lack of direction. The special effects and the musical score also takes a step backwards. Spider-Man 3 is a lot of fun and at times hilarious and jaw-dropping, but at other moments just misses the mark. The potential was there, it had the opportunity to be the best superhero film in existence, but with everyone having to share screen time, nobody besides Spider-Man actually got much time to present their capabilities (in terms of character and the acting). The list of underused characters is astounding; from Harry to Sandman, to J. Jameson, to most unfortunately, Venom.Spider-Man 3 takes place right after part 2, in which Peter Parker and Spider-Man are enjoying a new life of acceptance, success, and happiness. In the meantime, the new girlfriend MJ isn't getting the breaks in terms of her career. Things take a turn for the worse when ex-friend Harry tries to kill Peter in honor of his father, when an escaped convict accidentally gets superpowers, when a meteorite lands on Earth with a mysterious substance, and there is a new photography rival in Parker's newspaper. Despite the plot taking a few twists and turns, this movie is mostly drama. We still don't have the smart-aleck one-liners and laid-back attitude of Peter from the comic books, even though it seems like all the humor in the franchise has and will only come from Bruce Campbell (in another great cameo) and J. Simmons (underused, but scene-stealing). The writing is decent, but still has its moments of bad dialogue and somewhat unnecessary moments.The acting isn't that bad, especially when compared to other superhero flicks, it gets the job done. Topher Grace is the big surprise as he pulls off a surprisingly decent performance as Venom, while the rising star Thomas Haden Church does a superb job as a broken escape convict-turned supervillian Sandman. James Franco is the best among the main characters however playing the confused, angry, and sometimes charming (when happy) Harry. The special effects, as stated before, wasn't as good the third time around because it was rather overused in multiple instances. It does not help that the Oscar-winning special effects team behind the second installment did not make a return. The pacing however is really what hurts the movie the most. With so much to tell in so little time, the pacing goes rather fast for a Spider-Man movie, and then it leads to nobody but Spider-Man going through changes in front of the audience. The villains, while potentially horrifically menacing, pale in comparison to the enemies in the first two simply because they weren't in the movie much at all. Venom, the most-hyped portion of Spider-Man 3, gets very little screen time when he could easily have been a deadly force to reckon with.By the time the final act rolls around, the setbacks of the movie become very clear. Spider-Man 3 tried to add so much, tried to pack such a heavy punch, that we get a rather anti-climactic final battle, and an anti-climatic ending. The final sequence, despite being rather truthful to the comic books, still somewhat feels rushed and does not deliver as much as the previous battles throughout the movie. Instead of being a wild ride final chapter, we get a heavy dosage of melodrama. Yes, the Spider-Man films are about character and the emotions they go through more so than the action, but this time it was taken a bit too far. The chemistry between Parker and MJ wasn't as strong this time, as it was spent mostly bickering. So what happened? They tried pleasing everybody, from the comic book buffs to the action buffs to the fans of the previous installments. The end result is a rather mixed bag with its fun scenes and battles, but boy could it have been something else.Bottom Line: The third installment is not as good as the previous two, but still has plenty of good moments and some incredible action. However, trying to build so much, trying to tell so many stories and introduce so many characters, the plot feels rather tangled. They failed to build upon the villains, and we don't get to see them develop into the monsters they become like before. Worst of all, Venom, a character that could have really stolen the show and added horror and suspense to the picture, becomes nothing more than almost a mere cameo. The Spider-Man franchise isn't ready to give up, but perhaps its time to pass the directing and writing baton to others who might be able to give the trilogy a little face lift. They seem to have lost the way with this franchise, and perhaps with a new cast they can steer it in the right direction. Don't come into this movie expecting brilliance, but rather a decent popcorn flick with its flawsin other words, the typical popcorn flick.",6,1,3,5 May 2007
Thor: Ragnarok," A Jarring Shift in Formula Gives us the Best Thor Movie Yet
","I always sound like a broken record, but once again what Disney/Marvel continues to do in the film industry is unprecedented. To be able to pull off a dozen-plus movies and interweave them in the same exact universe (and then toss in television shows that link up) is unfathomably impressive to a point that we take it for granted. When Marvel was bought by Disney, it was a complete mess with their best IPs roaming all over the place and usually in the hands of Disney's very own competitors. What they were left with were properties that were well-known but were not the moneymakers of a Spider-Man or an X-Men. And Disney turned dirt into solid gold. And yes, I am certain I have written the likes of this before.Thor is one of the best examples of a comic being a good supporter in the Marvel universe, but not popular enough to successfully lead an entire trilogy, let alone his own movie. Yet here we are, third film in, and by far the best of three cinematic trips to Asgard. After seeing the success and acceptance of the insanity surrounding the Guardians of the Galaxy, the madmen of Marvel decided to throw out the book of the previous Thor movies and delivered a chaotic experience that meshes mythological themes with Star Wars scope, material of previously made comic books (Planet Hulk has a strong influence here) and then showering it with the 80s Marvel flair that made Guardians so enjoyable in the first place.This movie is action-packed, full of surprises, and has about as much humor as the best of comedies this decade. The storyline nonetheless is a lot more serious than the resulting tone and pace, as we see Thor stuck on a violent distant planet trying to escape and return to his homeland of Asgard and take on the Goddess of Death and prevent the end of his planet. And yes, the Goddess of Death is quite angry for many reasons. Unlike previous Thor flicks though, we have plenty of Marvel characters to see, including Hulk, Doctor Strange, Loki (I point this out because there wasn't enough Loki in The Dark World), and even some memorable new ones like Valkyrie and Korg.Ragnarok fixes all the issues of previous Thor movies and improves upon the elements that worked. For starters, Natalie Portman is gone. Let's toss this out of the way, that woman is a fine actress but was so disinterested in Marvel it shows in her performances. We have a deeper roster of characters, and see more time given to some of the better supporting characters (Once again, Loki). Chris Hemsworth is given more room to be humorous, and this pays off significantly as we are treated with a hilarious performance that is also full of heart and sheer confidence. The casting is excellent, with Cate Blanchett and Jeff Goldblum also providing excellent performances of MCU villains that are actually decent.The biggest and most obvious difference between the MCU and the always-inconsistent DCEU is the cinematic package of each installment. Disney and Marvel have gone to great lengths to make sure none of their blockbuster films ever gets too dreary, too predictable, or too dark. Notice they usually change up directors whenever they feel that the particular series needs a shakeup, resulting in a quirky director from New Zealand providing his talents for Ragnarok. The MCU always tries to blend comic book glee with comedy, some drama and sentimental value, and of course an arsenal of likable characters to always root for. Up until Wonder Woman, DCEU kept the tone somber, kept the tone gloomy, and just piles on the depression while failing to deliver decent characters or a wholesome experience that gives you a variety of emotions.Batman AND Superman lack the heroic flavor of previous generations and this is why Wonder Woman (who has the best actress/writing/directing combo) became the new face of DC---whether they like it or not. You will never see a DC movie get drizzled with 80s flair to lessen the tension and allow you to just enjoy the ride. And it's that 80s flair I keep praising, the zany humor, and the fast-paced directing gives Thor: Ragnarok a feeling of freshness you usually wouldn't expect from third installments of any trilogy. The creative freedom obviously given to the staff (even the musical score ditches the epic sound for a more synth-friendly barrage of tunes) allows for them to make wild series-changing decisions. The final act especially goes off the rails and opens up new doors for new story lines in the near future.Disney and Marvel's big advantage over all the 'universes' is its ability to link up all the films tightly and be willing to fearlessly expand their horizons for the future. Ragnarok's horizons and overall scope was bursting through the screen, which allowed to see many fun action pieces, delightful cinematography, multiple foes and obstacles, and just relentless top-notch entertainment. The MCU may have had its slight difficulties in the beginning but have quickly emerged into achieving Pixarish levels of expected quality. In a blockbuster film environment that has been sputtering lately, Marvel and Disney continues to shine above the gunk.Link: https://coffeeandscriptblog.wordpress.com/",9,2,8,5 November 2017
Midnight in Paris," More proof that Woody Allen is secretly European
","The world must be ending. It has to be. There is no other explanation. All the signs of the apocalypse are there. I actually thoroughly enjoyed a Woody Allen movie. I know, it's absolutely crazy, but nonetheless true. While most of your die-hard Allen fans will point out the superiority of Annie Hall, Manhattan, and probably to a lesser extent Match Point, I consider Midnight in Paris to be among his best if not his best film. The writing was fluid without becoming condescending or exaggerated, the acting is superb, the cinematography nearly flawless, the editing was quite sharp and best of all it was just a fun and unique trip through a city the medium of film has explored so many times.Midnight in Paris follows a struggling writer Gil (Owen Wilson) as he accompanies his fiancée (Rachel McAdams) and her family on a vacation to Paris. Falling in love with the city far more than everyone else in the party, the writer discovers that on a certain point in time in a certain area, he inexplicably is transported into his favorite time period and meets his favorite artists and influential individuals that shape his taste in literature, art, and music. The deeper he dwells into the 1920s, the further distance he feels from his life in the modern time. Watching this movie is like being part of a great inside joke; as you'll get much more of a kick out of this plot if you know most of the artistic geniuses that the main character runs into.Woody Allen's script here is nowhere near as deep, complex, or as thought-provoking as some of his works from 70s and 80s, but still works like a charm because of the creativity involved. Allen creates a dreamlike world that almost resembles artistic nirvana as we see our protagonist embed himself into the universe of 1920s Paris, which has a very different look, texture, and feel to the modern-day image of the romantic city. It's a lot of fun to see him bounce back and forth through time and realize how different he acts, reacts, and behaves depending on where (and when) he is.Owen Wilson is definitely a major player in the quality of this movie. He plays his role with such glee, such happiness and respect towards the subject matter involved that you can't help but feel sorry for him as he slugs his way through 2000s Paris with his disenchanted group. The rest of the cast also contribute greatly, ranging from Marion Cotillard as the beautiful and mysterious Adriana to Corey Stoll as the charismatic and unique Ernest Hemmingway. Rachel McAdams plays a role very different to her usual fare by being the mean-spirited and ignorant antagonist that is slowly sucking the life out of Gil. Love or hate Allen, he's usually good at casting the right cast, and Midnight in Paris is definitely no different. Keep an eye on the First Lady of France having some screen time in the flick.What makes this movie special is that you can't really dislike it or hate it. There is this everlasting charm and bubbly personality brewing in the film that makes it impossible for you to dwell on any of its potential setbacks. From start to finish it was a quirky and engaging adult fairy tale. This is a very fantasy-heavy film that never explains the why or the how, it just places you in the passenger seat and takes you on a wild entertaining ride.Bottom Line: Midnight in Paris is probably my new favorite Woody Allen film as he crafts a very lighthearted and fun story that puts a twist on the usual film about a vacation to Paris. The acting was wonderful, the writing was better than Allen's usual material (especially recently), and the overall production value from cinematography to art and costume design was above and beyond your typical low-budget movie. This film never goes over-the-top, never dwells into muttered and cluttered talk, and gives you a side of Paris you aren't used to seeing. One of the funniest and most unique films of 2011, you will not be disappointed.",9,0,1,18 February 2012
The Prestige," Seems like some of the film is missing..because not everything adds up...
","In a magic trick it usually consists of a hook, line, and sinker. The magician presents the scenario, proves its impossibility, and then defies the odds. How the trick is pulled off, magicians usually don't reveal. In movie-making however, it doesn't quite work in the same fashion. If you present a film that raises questions and the end of the final act does not answer them, then you have yourself a panned and wildly criticized film. The only kinds of questions that can remain unanswered are that which bare little importance to the main plot itself. Tarantino mastered this, by giving unanswered questions to almost all his films (Best example: Briefcase in Pulp Fiction). The Prestige however, suffers awfully from being unable to answer important questions. While the movie itself is entertaining, albeit a bit long, it fails to wrap up the story the way really good films do, like its rival 2006 magician hit The Illusionist. The hook and line are bearable to watch, but the sinker fails to satisfy. While it did give its nice twists and turns, The Prestige does not leave a satisfying finish.Rivalries can be very ugly. Take the Yankees-Red Sox, Bears-Packers, Canada-United States, Tupac-B.I.G., and Coke-Pepsi as pure examples. Some can be friendly, some can result in tension, and others result in worse. In the case of The Prestige, we have two magicians ready to kill each other if the opportunity was given. Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman) and Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) are rival magicians that are so hell-bent on figuring out the other's latest tricks and amazing acts that they will put their families, even their lives on the line. Meanwhile, Cutter (Michael Caine) is in the middle of it all, trying to end the foolish rivalry before it escalates into something more. Throughout the film you see each person gain the upper hand in terms of skills, success, and happiness more than once, but like a seesaw it goes back and forth until the final moments.Handling this grim and dark tale of competition is an all-star cast, an accomplished director, and David Bowie? Anyways, Christopher Nolan, who has been acclaimed as one of the better current directors out there, directs this film with a technique that mixes the choppy Memento and the dark Batman Begins. Using darker colors, longer shots to portray emotion, and hints and clues throughout, Nolan is certainly the right man to tackle this story because of its non-linear course. He does a much better job here than in Batman Begins in terms of serving a gloomy atmosphere and dim tone. Also involved in the writing, the Nolan brothers did a good job hiding the secrets from the audience, but also stretched the plot a bit too long, when it could have easily been a much shorter film. Perhaps it was because they wanted to foreshadow the ending on multiple instances? Perhaps because providing more content would give the ending a bit more closure? Nonetheless, not everything seen in the first two acts was actually necessary.At least we have some fine acting to help move the story along. Hugh Jackman removes the claws and does a superb job as a broken, bitter magician whose better days left him after circumstances beyond his control. Michael Caine tops Jackman with his portrayal as the magician not taking sides in the entire case, even when loves are on the line. David Bowie and Scarlett Johansson were good, but a bit underused. Christian Bale on the other hand, didn't provide as much effort here as in previous performances like in Batman Begins, The Machinist, among others.Pacing of the movie is its ultimate strength and its ultimate weakness. In a non-linear film, moving too fast would be confusing and make the viewer more lost than a blind drunk man in a mirror maze. Once again, citing Pulp Fiction as an example, the modern masterpiece clocks in at over 140 minutes, is slow-paced, and yet remains astoundingly entertaining and fun because it is so rich in content and detail. The Prestige on the other hand doesn't quite dazzle and entertain the way Pulp Fiction, Memento, Fight Club, and other non-linear movies do. With a phenomenal amount of dialogue and little action, the true fun of the film comes within its mysteries, its questions raised.Yet exactly like what would happen if the television show Lost abruptly ended, The Prestige does not answer all the questions, even when the credits roll. As the film progresses and the plot becomes thicker and the tensions and stakes raises, a lot of details raise questions about the who, the where, the why, and especially the how. Nolan was good at teasing the audience and leaving the bait, but failed to go for the kill when he really should've. He did not wrap up the story in a nice bow, or in a fashion that would leave the average viewer fulfilled. The Illusionist followed a similar pattern of leaving clues to the grand finale, except the ending answered all that needed to be answer. With questions that could result in several different answers, each of them potentially changing major themes in the movie itself, answers were more than necessary here and it was not delivered.Bottom Line: The Prestige is a dark, twisting movie that doesn't seem to find its course, and while it keeps the audience in check, it leads to an abrupt dead end with many questions hanging around. The direction was great, the casting was wonderful, and the cinematography was outstanding, but something in the writing was lacking--seemed to be missing. Then, to make things a bit more disappointing comes the final act, which may leave some viewers pleased, but may leave others scratching their heads. If you want all answers revealed, you are in for a major disillusionment.",6,3,6,13 March 2007
The Hateful Eight," Well-Directed but Poorly Written, Hateful Eight is a Tarantino pound cake--thick but not fully satisfying
","Kendrick Lamar was the best live performance I've ever seen. April 2014, he rocked UCF. However, we had to endure two hours of mediocre rappers before getting to the main event. By the time we got to the very good part of the night, we were emotionally, physically drained. Lamar did his best, but Orlando struggled to maintain the energy. This is Hateful Eight in a nutshell.It is extremely hard to get mad at Tarantino and the Hateful Eight project as they went through extreme lengths to ensure that it felt, sounded, and looked like a Western straight out of the 1960s. From getting Ennio Morricone to compose the soundtrack to using the same cameras used to film Charlton Heston, Tarantino and friends reached far back into cinematic history and moved it to present day. This alone propels the movie to become a unique experience, as there is actually an overture and then an intermission about halfway into the film.But leading up to that intermission is where the film really struggles. Throughout his career, the better Tarantino's script is, the better the movie will become—regardless of all the other intangibles. Death Proof's climax rivals as one of the best in the past decade, but the ho-hum dialogue and unlikable first round of characters prevented us from truly enjoying it. In the meantime, Reservoir Dogs is one of the rare movies in which literally every word said is important, making it one of the best indie films you'll ever see.There is a lot of what I like to call abe dialogue (already been established) in Hateful Eight—leading to a lot of repetitive dialogue, repetitive conversations, and verbal revelations that we had already encountered. As a matter of fact, you could have cut the first third of the movie because the facts and characterizations created were re-created once the movie's setting becomes more claustrophobic and remains in the cabin. Part of Tarantino's magic was his ability to create awesome characters without revealing too much about them. Sadly we don't get much of this in Hateful Eight.The Tarantinoisms (good music, sharp imagery, inventive directing) start taking off once intermission ends and the intriguing mystery begins, as the tension suddenly revs up. In the second half is when things become interesting and the actors (and lone main actress) can start chewing at the scenery. The words suddenly become important, the details become more prevalent, and the audience has become much more engaged. In spite of this, the length of the film and the over-indulgence of throwaway dialogue weighs down on you and never allows for Hateful Eight to really reach the quality lengths of Tarantino's other hybrid westerns like Django Unchained and Inglorious Basterds.Hateful Eight is like a large fluffy pound cake, a lot of density but lacking in flavor and substance. Tarantino directed this with his usual precision and quirkiness, however it lacks an outstanding moment, it lacks an outstanding character, and with the climax being delayed in favor of displaying past events it's hard to find the pulse of this irregular heartbeat.In order for lengthy movies to maintain interest you have to cover a lot of ground in terms of whether years or space. The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly covers an insane amount of Western territory, leading to every minute being required. Shawshank Redemption covers over two decades of prison life, so it too needed every minute. Hateful Eight is a cinematic bottle episode that could have been much shorter, much tighter, and with that each detail and word being much more vital.Somewhere in that cabin lies a good story, and overall a good movie. You just have to get past the thicket of words to find it.",5,4,17,6 January 2016
Fast & Furious 6," Still Fast, Still Furious, Still Entertaining
","Fast and Furious has become the most awkwardly successful franchise in the history of film, and the sixth installment just adds to the insanity. Since when does a Part 6 to ANY film find any success or quality? This is an underrated first in cinematic history (Star Wars: Return of the Jedi does not count) as this testosterone-laden monolith of an action flick delivers the women, cars, action, comedy, and themes of family that has become a staple to the franchise since its subtle revival in Fast and Furious.If you have enjoyed this new direction of the Fast/Furious series then there will be nothing here that will disappoint you, from the stunts to the direction to the manly cast that makes the male viewers watching this look like Steve Urkel. The plot is a simple stop-that-man tale that involves the entire cast from Fast Five as well as a couple familiar faces from previous installments, which explains the opening sequence playing out like a flashback. The rest of the movie plays out like an extremely expensive music video with likable characters and high octane action sequences attached.What keeps the motors of this movie (and franchise overall) running is the very likable cast of characters and the connection they've developed with the dedicated fanbase. Even though certain characters like Brian and Mia (Paul Walker shines but is limited) have taken less screen time and we have more focus on Dom and Luke (Vin Diesel and Dwayne Johnson), they each have their moments to shine and get the audience excited. The writing doesn't totally excel but it goes straight to the point of the conflict at hand and what is at stake.But the cars and what happens to them is the heart and soul of Fast 6. Justin Lin is improving as an action director as he delivers the sequences with precise camera movement, surprisingly crisp cinematography, and enough space so that you can see the sheer scale of the mayhem occurring. While Fast Five still has the ultimate action sequence in the past half-decade, the latter action scenes will leave you breathless guaranteed.This is a very you-get-what-you-paid for film, as it doesn't quite take the franchise to the next level, but maintains delivering what you've come to expect out of these films. The beautiful women will be here, as well as the buff men, the tough-as-nails action, the beautiful cars, the good soundtrack, and a pace that matches that of a car---once the engines are running it truly takes off. While there is no evolution, there is plenty of entertainment to go around for everybody willing to watch.And do stay tuned for the credits. Just when you think that eventual next installment might be overkill, you will leave the theater excited.",8,0,1,24 May 2013
Knocked Up," The cast behind recent 'frat pack' adult comedies deliver yet again with another vulgar yet charming comedy
","Anti-PG-13 folks rejoice; there is yet another enjoyable R-rated romantic comedy that is both vulgar and sweet at the same time, while embracing the restricted rating rather than try too hard to receive it. From the writer and director of the awesome sleeper hit The 40-Year Old Virgin comes another film about relationships and the fickle business surrounding it. While this isn't as charming or as funny as the 2005 hit that helped revive the genre of adult comedies, it still contains a heavy dosage of laughs, plenty of insightful commentary about society, and its little bit of bittersweet moments that lightens the mood of the film.Knocked Up is about two very different people that meet at a bar and engage in a one-night stand. Their moment together was supposed to be the first and only time they would see each other, but upon pregnancy tests it is revealed that Ben Stone (Seth Rogan) and Allison Scott (Katherine Heigl) are going to become parents. They now have several months to get to know each other, attempt to be in a relationship for the baby; despite the circumstances and less-than-helpful insight from another couple related to Allison (Leslie Mann and Paul Rudd). Can a carefree jobless druggie and a hard-working yet unsure interviewer bond together for the child they have decided to introduce to the world? The plot, while very believable, doesn't always tread down a path of predictability.The bittersweet symphony that is Knocked Up can be traced to the excellent acting staff that can portray emotions as well as deliver improvised one-liners. The main couple in this movie, Rogan and Heigl were perfectly cast and despite their obvious differences were able to have plenty of chemistry together. However, Seth Rogan and all his roommates (Jason Segel, Jay Baruchel, Jonah Hill, and Martin Starr) provide almost all the jokes and laughs throughout this movie. The gags and one-liners from the roomies range from chuckles to uncontrollable laughter. Last but not least portraying the troubled couple, Mann and Rudd did a superb job on their own being everything the character Allison did not want in her life.While the casting is what excels best here, the writing and directing of rising powerhouse Judd Apatow (Virgin, Fun With Dick and Jane, Anchorman, Talladega Nights, even Heavyweights) is a big help as well. Being able to combine crude jokes, sex jokes, with commentary and light drama isn't easy, but like his previous work, Apatow succeeds. While his directing isn't groundbreaking, he knows how to maintain the pace and knows how to handle shots when the actors are in their improvising moods. He doesn't dazzle with any amazing-looking shots and angles, but maintains the humor throughout the picture, which not everyone in Hollywood can do nowadays.Where this film loses points is in the editing. Surely there are great moments throughout, but there are many moments that were not necessary, that could have been cut without damaging the quality of the movie. The jokes stop flying once the third act begins, which is around the same time then the movie begins to drag. Fortunately though, it doesn't last too long as we see the funny cast together again for the climax, and then the charming ending that doesn't overstay its welcome.Bottom Line: Fans of The 40-Year-Old Virgin and other works from this new unnamed frat pack that consists of Rogan, Rudd, Mann, Apatow will be pleased with Knocked Up. It is a superbly written comedy with great dialogue, many funny gags, a good chunk of improvisation, and a bit of heart. The acting, writing and directing is great, but unfortunately is marred by rather weak editing. Don't let that bring you down, because the cast makes up for the shortcomings in the cutting process and the running time allowed (over 2 hours for a romantic comedy is rather long). Apatow is beginning to leave a mark on Hollywood, and his cast of actors and actresses are breathing fresh life into a genre that faded into obscurity in the 1990s. These movies are becoming this generation's Caddyshack, National Lampoon's Vacation, Stripes, and Animal House. For anyone giving up hope on Hollywood, this is the silver lining that you should see so you can see the light to the end of the mediocrity tunnel.",8,1,3,2 June 2007
Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street," Unlike musicals of the past, it doesn't try to lure in new fans--but definitely will satisfy all the old ones
","Tim Burton seems to prefer the dark, he was the child that wasn't afraid of the lack of lights, he embraced it. Over the span of his very successful career he excels in dark, grim tales that dances with an art style that has become a staple of his movies and eventually pop culture. He has a lot of hits (Batman, Pee-Wee's Big Adventure, Beetlejuice, Nightmare Before Christmas) and very few misses (Batman Returns, Corpse Bride). He turns his attention to musicals, a darkly comical one at that (who saw this coming?). Reuniting yet again with Johnny Depp and his off-screen girlfriend Helena Bonham Carter, Burton adapts the unique horror musical and puts his little spin on it. Unfortunately, it wasn't enough of a spin. While fans of the musical will be overwhelmed and absolutely delighted that the transition was extremely accurate and doesn't miss a beat, others and/or those who do not like Stephen Sondheim's murderous music aren't going to find much delight here. Tim Burton put his special touch, but doesn't expand upon it, which unlike in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and Batman Returns; it prevents Sweeny Todd from being a fun movie.Sweeny Todd follows the grim, angry, bitter, vengeful barber (Johnny Depp) that was banished away from his home, wife, (Laura Michelle Kelly) and child because of a jealous judge (Alan Rickman). Upon his return he changes his identity, finds a new friend (Helena Bonham Carter), and seeks the death of the man that stole a good portion of his life. There are no rainbows in this picture, in case you are wondering. Things take a nastier turn when his focus of murder begins to broaden. If there is a strong element in this movie, it's the casting. We have Oscar nominees, distinguished actors and actresses, unknown gems, and underrated talent running this show, and they range from Jack Sparrow to Borat to Hans Gruber to even Marla Singer. While their singing isn't the greatest, they possess the energy needed to run this musical. Notable performances include Johnny Depp, Carter, and of course, Rickman, who is always great as a villain.The singing isn't as bad as the musical numbers though. Unlike classics like Grease, Rocky Horror Picture Show, Mary Poppins, Sound of Music and even the modern-day gem Chicago, there isn't any song that stands out or plays in your head long after the credits start rolling. There is nobody to blame except the musical itself. As a matter of fact, the lack of entertaining content can be totally traced back to the musical itself; which offers a lot of gruesome details, scant singing, but not enough time to sit and absorb what's happening. In musicals, there should be a balance between song and dialogue and action. Sweeny Todd certainly has the endless plethora of songs, but rather lacks any fun or slick storytelling and dialogue between vocal jumps. Here Tim Butron can add in whatever he wants to enhance the play or at least make it remotely different.For whatever reason, Burton was a bit hesitant. To supporters of the musical, this is a blessing. Instead of notching his own vision, he instead uses his filming techniques and art styles to bring the musical to life, and it works to the highest degree. Sweeny Todd is one of the most visually impressive movies of 2007, and doesn't cut back on the gore at all. The harsh tone is perfectly set, and even when higher-contrast colors are used (in one pivotal scene), we never leave the bleak world of London created by Burton. But, with the musical being rather dull and totally predictable in the end, a little change couldn't hurt, right? Couldn't we spice up the movie with a bit more dark humor? Couldn't we get rid of some pointless musical interludes that have very little effect on the overall plot? Of all the times in which it would have been nice to see a little difference from the original source by the famed director, it happens when Burton wants to actually remain faithful. So, outside of the circle of Sweeny fans, we aren't going to find many followers.Bottom Line: Good musicals in film blend a lot of energy with kinetic action and decent songs. Sweeny Todd lacks the action, lacks a little energy and desire to dare, but did have enough music for sure. The exaggerating and usually-moody style of Burton was a perfect match for this musical; unfortunately the musical isn't that great to begin with. Then with Burton remaining totally, totally true, it fails to really captivate those not already familiar with the musical. The dark humor wasn't as scattered as one would hope, and it's a shame that the amazing talents of all the actors and actresses involved are overlooked by the controversial content and heavy dosage of blood spewing across the screen. It is visually stimulating, but not very rich. Will you enjoy this movie? If you enjoy the musical and an endless barrage of singing. Is it better than the classic musicals of past and present? Hardly. But who is at fault here? It is hard to point a finger, but maybe because I've set the bar higher than I should. After all, if I didn't like the musical, why would I ever expect to enjoy this? Expect blood, guts, and a glut of singing.",5,2,5,28 January 2008
Blades of Glory," Huh? This movie is sweet? Heder is actually funny? There is more than just catchy one-liners here? Surprise, surprise
","Don't look now, but we have another surprisingly funny movie here. While the formula remains the same, Blades of Glory succeeds with more than just Ferrell's ability to improvise. We have a decent script full of creative gags, plot turns, and content that does not involve our poster boy in the picture. This movie is full of surprises, as it is surprisingly sweet, surprisingly smart, and surprisingly violent. Jon Heder is actually bearable this time, and with a nice supporting cast; Blades of Glory is not as quotable, but just as complete a picture as previous Ferrell films (Might have to do with Ben Stiller producing this one). Besides, any movie that can make figure skating remotely interesting deserves some special praise.Blades of Glory is about two figure skaters, Chazz Michael Michaels (Will Ferrell) and Jimmy MacElroy (Jon Heder), banned from men's figure skating for life after a melee erupts following a tie. However, years later it is discovered that they can skate again, but as a pair in doubles competition. Because of their miserable status at the time, the two try to reconcile and get along and be able to compete. With the help of an old coach (Craig T. Nelson), the former rivals try to win the gold by working as a couple. However, there is a brother-sister skating duo (Will Arnett and Amy Poeheler) that does not approve of their comeback attempt.Ferrell and Heder make a decent comedy team, but it is Ferrell and his barrage of one-liners that once again steals the thunder and the entire film from everyone else involved. His presence alone is funny, and almost everything that comes out of his mouth is a stupid and quotable line. Heder has been rather afraid of branching out to different roles since his breakthrough role as Napoleon Dynamite. However, his best talent, which is his dance movements, comes through here as he portrays a very sensitive, artsy, and flamboyant figure skater. He actually does a good job here, which is quite a shock considering recent efforts. A delightful supporting cast is there for more than just star power--Arnett, Poeheler, Nelson, and the adorably sweet Jenna Fischer (The Office) do great in their roles.Unlike other (especially recent) comedic vehicles, it's more than just dialogue and cameos running the show. With good skating choreography, great writing, and funny long-lasting gags, Blades of Glory successfully separates itself from other Ferell movies like Anchorman and Talladega Nights. The long fun gags include an ice skate chase that escalates way beyond the ice, a disgusting way to recover a key, the running joke of the homoeroticism with the sport, and a forbidden skate move that has rather strong consequences. The technical aspects of Blades of Glory are a mixed bag. Some of the special effects are good, but other times its obvious and laughably fake. The direction (Josh Gordon, Will Speck) is at times good, and then at other times lacks energy. Finally however, the editing was spot-on, as the movie never drags and remains at a respectable running time of 93 minutes, despite the slew of hit-and-miss jokes.Of course, while it is Ferrell's best in a long time, it's not without its flaws. The hit-to-miss joke ratio is better than before, but still could use some improvement. For example, every ten attempts at humor, it succeeds six to seven times. Some of the misses are a bit gut wrenching however, especially that of an obsessed fan. The other problem is, if you do not like Ferrell, then there is no way this film will change your mind. Ferell plays the same character as in his previous works, except a lot more sex-driven and much more vulgar. There is nothing really new here, just a different environment and with a better script. Don't come in here expecting a totally different Will Ferrell.Bottom Line: Despite its flaws, Blades of Glory is another fun film from funnyman (say those previous four words ten times fast) Will Ferrell, but this time we have a better cast and better men behind the camera. The improvising still exists, but nowhere near as much as before. With a nice blend of stupid humor and physical humor and also a hint of shock value, Blades of Glory is arguably the best ice skating comedy we've ever seen. Come to think of it however, it might be the only ice skating comedy out there. This is Jon Heder's best film, as he finally separates himself from the nerd stereotype he is so 'good' at portraying. Finally, we see plenty of potentially wonderful careers rising here, especially that of Amy Poeheler and Jenna Fischer. Blades of Glory: The 'Frat Pack' delivers somewhat yet again, but in a much more complete package of entertainment. If you liked the Frat Pack movies of before, this is definitely for you.",7,1,2,1 April 2007
Horrible Bosses," I'll take my comedy raw, blackened, with a side of crazy please.
","Murder. Car chases. Scandal. Rape. Conspiracy. Blackmail. Revenge. These are usually the key words to a suspenseful drama, but in this case are applied to a dark comedy that is relentless, chaotic, and just as funny as advertised. Horrible Bosses is the type of movie that would make Danny DeVito proud, as it blends a fun plot full of fun twists with standout comedic performances, plenty of surprises, and the inability to ever become predictable. Unlike most recent R-rated comedies, this film is raunchy without truly crossing the line, profane without becoming redundant and outrageous without becoming tedious. Don't look now but this movie is legitimately funny, and among the better comedies released in quite some time.Horrible Bosses is about three average joes (Jason Bateman, Charlie Day, Jason Sudeikis) that are stuck on their job with awful bosses (Kevin Spacey, Jennifer Aniston, Colin Ferrell) all for different reasons. After all three reach their breaking point, they decide that their lives would be better if their bosses ceased to exist. What follows is their hilarious efforts in finding a way to get it done without getting caught. The premise was promising and thanks to a fresh script by Michael Markovitz, John Daly, and Jonathan Goldstein, the potential was indeed deliveredâ€”although not in the ways you'd expect.The cast is hands-down the standout reason why this movie works. As a matter of fact its also its one minor flaw because we have tons of talent that were not utilized enough because some of the performances were so hilarious in the minimal material given. The bosses themselves were convincingly awful, especially the always-reliable Kevin Spacey as this sadistic, manipulative, and extremely cruel president of a company. Colin Ferrell and Jennifer Aniston step out of their usual roles and surprisingly deliver plenty of laughs with their own cruelly aggressive mannerisms. The main three also provided plenty of laughs and played off each other perfectly well, with Charlie Day being the best of the three. Day's experience with the mildly-dark 'It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia' definitely shows off here, as his whiny and high-pitched voice perfectly matches his character persona and offers the most laughs and one-liners.Seth Gordon's resume as director has been an interesting one; ranging from the enjoyable Fistful of Quarters to the weak-weak Four Christmases. In here, he keeps the pace constantly quick, constantly throws a crazy scenario to pit our heroes in, and never gives you a chance to breathe and realize how preposterous this movie really is. The movie's raunchiness is matched by its grim sense of humorâ€”you need a dark strong heart to laugh at some of the mean-spirited shtick that is embedded in the 100 minute timeframe. In this movie, nobody is safe, and you never know just what might happen next. Unpredictability is essential in comedy, and the best part of Horrible Bosses is how it can remain one step ahead of you while still giving plenty to laugh about. We are laughing at our heroes but secretly we are definitely rooting for them too. Yes folks, you will secretly be hoping that they do indeed do the dirty deed.Bottom Line: The talent pool runs deep here, and is the main reason why the film works. Luckily for us and the cast, they also got to work with great pacing, a fun script, and fresh dark humor that can inject life in this dismal summer season. The underrated talent of Sudekis, Day, and Bateman continue to quietly shine in Hollywood as they are hilarious from the first second to the closing credits. But let's not forget the triple-villain team of Aniston, Spacey, and Ferrell, which infused even more humor (and craziness) into the comedy. To sum it up, the film works in its dark manner, as Horrible Bosses never takes itself seriously, but you'll be too deep into laughter to notice the difference. The movie is dark as the movie earned its R rating easily, but if you can handle it you are in for a uproarious ride. Keep an eye on this one, as it is one of the best summer surprises in recent years.",9,137,240,9 July 2011
Nacho Libre," Silly, campy, and a lot of fun; Jack Black leads the way as Nacho Libre is gleeful family fun
","Napoleon Dynamite stands as one of the most overrated disasters ever put to the big screen. That being said, the Hess couple gets it right the second time around with Nacho Libre. With a nice message, plenty of fun gags, a plot that actually contains some content, and laughs throughout, this Nick flick stands as one of the better efforts to contain the Nickelodeon name (even though in the trailers its not really that present). Jack Black more than steals the show as the main character, and a charming supporting cast helps makes this film an enjoyable one for kids and adults.What makes Napoleon Dynamite such a massive cult hit is the type of humor Jared Hess and the gang use in their movies. Their brand of humor, which is very dry, makes it a whether-you-love-it-or-hate-it kind of humor, one that can be compared to that of Woody Allen. While in Dynamite all there was in the 90 minutes was dry humor, Nacho Libre mixes dry humor with some slapstick comedy, extremely silly dialogue, and some hilarious Spanish jokes. We get a bit more variety here.In Nacho Libre, we follow a man who cooks for kids in a church, but wants to live the glamorous life of a wrestler as well. At first he was fighting to earn some money for the orphans he takes care of, but little by little the life of fame consumes him, casting a smokescreen over what is really important in his life; the kids, the beautiful nun (Played by the beautiful Ana De La Reguera), and the church he lives in. Can he live a double life without sinning and angering God or will he be forced to choose one life over the other? Jack Black steals and runs this show as his performance as the main character is easily the best in the movie. Carrying a silly grin on his face and willing to bend over backwards to get a laugh (like a fat Jim Carrey), the biggest laughs come from him. Almost as funny as Black is the hilarious Héctor Jiménez, who wears a crooked smile but also carries a dosage of physical humor that helps this movie; he would have been perfect for the role of Pedro in Napoleon Dynamite. Enrique Muñoz as Senor Ramon was awesome, its unfortunate he didn't get much screen time.With plenty of goofy action, this is just as much a kid's flick as an adult flick; there isn't much balance in terms of humor. Yet, this will totally appeal to the fans of deadpan, dry, and Simpsons-like humor. This should also appeal to the Napoleon Dynamite fans as well. Unfortunately though, the direction from Jared Hess still needs work. Some shots are totally random and way out-there, and utterly pointless. Sometimes, Hess makes some shots of people looking at the camera take way too long. There aren't long shots of the landscape, just incredibly long Andy Warhol-like shots of the actors and actresses themselves, and makes the movie 10 minutes longer than it should be. Last but not least, he should try to stay away from the stereotypical material of his work; that kind of humor wears out really thin, unless you are Mel Brooks.Bottom Line: Hess' second effort is much better than his first in every aspect whatsoever, but while his writing and comical substance excels, his directing still needs a bit of work. It's a silly premise done well thanks to the cast, and especially thanks to Jack Black. Only Black can make a scene about people eating toast and a scene about a man serving salad hysterical. Plenty of laughs, but don't expect Oscar-worthy stuff. Its great for the whole family, its Nacho Libre!",8,6,11,13 November 2006
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," Bold, Brilliant, and with Captain America on top of his game, The Winter Soldier is the among the best cinematic Marvel movies out there
","How can any Marvel movie match up to The Avengers? Similar to what happened to the quality value of The Expendables franchise after the Indonesian bloodbath funfest The Raid totally rewrote the rules on how to film and execute an action movie, The Avengers became the pinnacle of Marvel films simply because of all the superheroes involved and the sheer scope of the comic book mayhem. Overall it knocked down the standalone Marvel movies and even the Batman movies a few notches. Let's be honest, the Nolan Batman trilogy would have overall ranked to just above Spider-Man level if it had not been for The Dark Knight's Joker. How can Iron Man 3, Thor 2, and Captain America 2 possibly live up to The Avengers when it features each of these heroes AND more? Well, Captain America: The Winter Soldier succeeds by providing a deep plot, plenty of action, and an ability to take some gambles that will have ramifications within the cinematic Marvel universe. Lastly, menacing villains that doesn't involve ripping the hearts of comic book fans (a.k.a. The Mandarin in Iron Man 3) is always an added bonus.In the mix of heroes, Captain America is the most likable and also the most relatable because of his sheer commitment to keeping the American public safe while also being wary of the 21st century techniques of keeping the nation out of harm's way. But adding to the mix are The Falcon and Black Widow, two also very supportable characters (Helps to have Scarlett Johansson and Anthony Mackie) with similar goals, even though Black Widow's intentions can become muddy. All three are wrapped in a story that involves decades of betrayal, dark secrets, and politics behind staying one step ahead of domestic, foreign, and intergalactic terrorism. With a script that hits close to home, this is easily the best-written of the Marvel films thanks to Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely.Tying in all the plot twists and surprises are well-executed action sequences that rely very little on CGI (well, up until the big climax) and depend more on excellent stunts, clever editing, and great direction (Special props to the Russo Brothers). The chases are fun, the shootouts are intense, and the hand-to-hand combat is leagues above the normal comic book movie. Instead of one overarching villain, we have multiple enemies fighting in the front lines and behind the scenes, increasing the tension throughout the movie---especially in the breathtaking final act.Bottom Line: Captain America: The Winter Soldier is the best of the standalone Marvel movies since the original Iron Man because its plot and themes hit close to the heart, the action is relentless, it never becomes too predictable, the acting is great, and the blend of political thriller gives it a special taint you usually don't find in comic book films. It is entertaining, thought-provoking, and intriguing from start to finish. Like your best Marvel comic books, it has plenty of heroes, plenty of enemies, and never wears out its welcome. Bring on Avengers 2, because the Disney/Marvel brand is definitely going in the right direction.",8,2,4,7 April 2014
Ocean's Thirteen," Who is friend #13 anyway?
","What happens when your sequel to a highly successful heist caper delivers a plot twist so unappealing it makes Carrot Top look like Brad Pitt? Go back to the basics. Start from the top, check and see just what made the original so much better and entertaining. Nonetheless, this is what happens with the third installment, and ultimately delivers. Using an excellent staff, quirky camera work, plenty of subtle and unsubtle humor, decent soundtrack, and lack of drama (that was all-too-present in Ocean's Twelve), the third part of this surprise hit trilogy actually holds up well against the original while easily surpassing the sequel. While the lack of women may be a bit of a downer, it could be for the best of the movieand for the men after all it does take place in Las Vegas.After being able to pay off all their debts and whatnot, their next heist has to do with revenge above anything else. After one of the Ocean squad gets ripped off and loses almost all his money to the egotistical and powerful casino owner Willy Bank, the rest of the crew seeks revenge as Bank's latest casino is about to open. Using high-tech gadgets, seduction, and even the help of former enemies, Ocean and the crew attempt to destroy West's opening night by making millions upon millions of dollars for them and other people in a matter of five minutes. While the plot isn't exactly the most believable out there, it doesn't distract from the overall experience.Ocean's 13 is all about the cast of characters, their chemistry together, and their interactions with each other. George Clooney, Brad Pitt, and Matt Damon are the main three in terms of screen time and also in terms of performance. Clooney and Pitt carry this aura of smoothness and sophisticated style that not everyone in the Hollywood world has. Helping the pack is Matt Damon, Don Cheadle, Carl Reiner, Casey Affleck, Bernie Mac, and more. Rounding out the cast is yet another great performance from the excellent Al Pacino as the villain getting what he deserves, and then Andy Garcia whom was the villain from the previous two heist movies.The budget here is not spent on explosions, monsters, or extensive use of CGI, but instead on expensive yet jaw-dropping sets and props. The casino looked magnificent from the inside and from the outside, as well as pretty much every place in the entire movie (with the exception of Mexico, but you'll see why). In the meantime, returning director Steven Soderbergh gleefully plays and toys with the camera with different angles, different kinds of shots, wide variety of lengths of shots, and even borrowing a technique that was made famous in Fight Club. While its nothing experimental, Soderbergh does a good job showcasing a story using a variety of techniques so the movie never even considers looking stale. Completing the directing is a sort of old-school vibe that accompanies the soundtrack. It begins to look so dated that you might expect even Sinatra to make an appearance.Pacing is what is a turn-off for some moviegoers, and pretty much what destroyed Ocean's 12 (despite the unforgivable plot). Unlike recent third installments, the pacing here remains consistent, and for the most part works well. The majority of Ocean's 13 is setting up the grand scheme, which ranges from an underground bunker in Nevada to a factory in Mexico. The third act is when the plan starts getting off the ground, and the payoff is definitely great for the audience and the lucky cast of gamblers unaware of what is about to unfold.Bottom Line: Despite some missing members of before (where'd all the women go?) Ocean's 13 is slick, stylish, fun, and everything that made the original a surprise smash. The chemistry among the crew remains intact, but now we have a better story to follow, and a better heist to capture on film. Capturing all the glee is Soderbergh, who once again excels in putting his distinct methods of film-making to good use as he contributes a dosage of style, pizazz and old-school flavor to the movie. The ending leaves the door open for more, and as long as they remain as entertaining as this, why shouldn't we continue the series? Clooney, Damon, and especially Brad Pitt seem to have a lot of fun robbing people and screwing around. Whatever happened to the good-ol' days of classic, one-track storytelling anyway?",8,2,6,9 June 2007
Interstellar," Interstellar is like the comedian having to explain and dissect the now-magicless joke.
","Interstellar is like trying to consume a 10-inch slice of pizza in your mouth without chewing: we know the pizza is always good, and we know that the more pizza the better, but then after a point it becomes pure overkill. That is what Interstellar is: cinematic overkill that overstays its welcome, overstays its logic, and lingers around long enough for you to notice the rapidly-thinning plot. The technical aspects were indeed spectacular in every sense of the way, which arguably keeps the movie afloat for as long as it possibly can before the third act weighs everything down with its left field conclusion.What really limits Interstellar more than anything else is the plot and the script. Movies that use a backdrop as vast and expansive as space needs a smaller story to keep the audience and the logic in check. This is what worked for Wall-E, Gravity, and to a lesser extent 2001: A Space Odyssey. With Interstellar however, too much is explained, and the audience is required to make massive leaps of faith that we may not be willing to make---especially after already going through two hours of it. The dialogue is slightly overblown and loses authenticity, and by the climax too much is being discussed and not enough is being shown.The performances and the technical details keep the dialogue and story from disappointing us too much. Matthew McConaughey carries this film well as he becomes simply a man concerned about the future of his family in the midst of the grand space adventure that takes too many twists and turns that requires a second viewing to fully realize it all. Anne Hathaway, Jessica Chastain, and Michael Caine did a swell job with the minimal material handed to them. They each added a sense of believability to a plot that was quite devoid of them as the movie went on.The cinematography and special effects were top-notch, although they suffered a few setbacks if you compare them to 2013's Gravity. Interstellar hides its space scope with far too many closeups of the crew in the space station, when there was an entire universe to be explored. The other locales themselves were quite lacking in eyecandy and creativity, leading to us longing for more scenes of outer space.Also hurting this film was that too much was happening at the same time, not in plot but in presentation. Sometimes the dialogue audio was battling the musical score and sound effects, resulting in a loud mass that made it tough to hear and comprehend the scene. In the case of Gravity and 2001, it was made sure the music was front and center, toning down just slightly when dialogue was needed to be said.Christopher Nolan is a go-big-or-go-home type of director. Simplicity is not in his resume, he loves his stories and films complex, full of wonder, full of questions, and full of awe-inspiring scenes. However, simplicity is what is definitely lacking in Interstellar. If the film spent more time showing instead of telling, then we would have had a better visual feast ahead of us. A movie of this kind, with so much room to explore, needs to be more like Jurassic Park (simple, yet incredibly thrilling) and less like Contact (psychologically and philosophically inducing).I truly wanted to enjoy this movie, considering the time, effort, and sheer labor put in to this cinematic space opera. But the entire affair was too bloated, too overdone, and just altogether didn't leave much to the imagination. Each of the pieces were good from the acting to the directing to the cinematography to the special effects. But altogether none of it really meshed, even with a running time of over 160 minutes.In space, nobody can hear you. In the movie theater however, every yawn can indeed be heard, now matter how pretty it looked...",5,6,11,22 November 2014
Ant-Man," Ant-Man is a surprisingly entertaining romp with a stellar script and stellar cast
","In the midst of all the behind-the-scenes chaos, what we see here is quite possibly Marvel's best film since the original Iron Man. Containing the extremely-loose approach of the Phase 1 Marvel flicks, the delightful quirks and details from Edgar Wright's script, and the carefree fun of Paul Rudd (Role Models) and Adam McKay (Will Ferrell's best work), Ant-Man is comic book brilliance that substitutes style for wonderful characters and plenty of content to chew at. Of course let's not forget the slew of Marvel surprises that we honestly didn't see enough of in Age of Ultron. Thanks to the strict organized approach from Disney, it is safe to say that Marvel is still leagues ahead of the competition in terms of comic book and summer blockbuster films.The staff is incredible, and must have made the director's job quite easy. Starting with the always-reliable Paul Rudd and the silently-efficient Evangeline Lilly, we have an excellent entourage bringing what is a relatively unknown comic book to life. Rounding out the staff is the very serious and engaging Michael Douglas, an unexpected addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The themes presented in Ant-Man are a bit more personal than your usual blockbuster fare, with plots involving redemption, forgiveness, and father/sibling relationships all blending in together---and this requires better performances from even your villains. From our villain (Corey Stoll bringing some depth to our mad scientist) to our father figure right down to the partner-in-crime (Michael Pena, also excellent) Ant-Man boasts one of the strongest lineups in all of 2015. Honestly though, what's with Disney and fathers? Usually creative differences from the writing squadron in the midst of filming will result in mixed content throughout the finished product. Disney's very own Brave is one of the better recent examples, with the first and second half of the movie being extremely different in tone, pace, and even character. Quite miraculously, you don't get this sensation in Ant-Man, from the first act origin story right down to the exciting climax that delivers enough action to cover the extensive prologue. It has obvious touches of Edgar Wright's quick-paced humor and character depth, but has Rudd's clever subtle comic timing and McKay's humorous mayhem. A four-team staff complied the script, and what could have been a disaster actually results in a complete screenplay with a little bit of everything: humor, heart, action, and tons of connections to other Marvel properties.Peyton Reed has a resume that could raise some eyebrows (sneaky-fun Bring it On, could-be-better Yes Man), but doesn't disappoint here. Although he has far less action to work with, he manages to keep Ant-Man fun, grounded, and simple. It has its share of emotion, but it never drags too far or mucks up the blockbuster glee. He treats it like a heist film, with unique circumstances. Under the hook/line/sinker approach, the biggest sequence is saved for last and will keep you on your toes, while also laughing along the way thanks to the sprinkles of humor flung in for good measure.Similar to the equally-unique Guardians of the Galaxy, Ant-Man is enjoyable because it never feels like its holding back any punches to save for the next (obviously going to happen) installment. Unlike Age of Ultron and Thor: The Dark World, it feels like a complete story, and will keep you asking for more---especially after the post-credits sequences. It fires on all cylinders with the permission of Marvel and the Disney Marketing Machine, and despite not having the previous popularity credentials of a Batman or a Spider-Man, Ant-Man leaves a nice footprint in the cinematic comic book universe. Don't let the slightly campy outlook of Ant-Man fool you, this is a seriously entertaining picture worth a thousand words of praise.",9,6,14,10 August 2015
The Bourne Ultimatum," Jason Bourne and the shaky cam return with a vengeance
","If you think the first two Bourne movies were out of control, that's only because you are reading this without having actually seen the third installment. The Bourne Ultimatum is a thrill ride of a movie, and wastes absolutely no time in getting started. What made the first two films very good is present in this one, plus much more. In it we have more crazy chases, insane camera work, over a dozen different settings, brutal fights, tense moments, and very limited slowdown. The plot is not as convoluted or as smart as the others, but we still have an engaging story that is full of twists, mysteries, and surprises. To top it all off, this is the most brutal of the three, as the production holds back no punches.The Bourne Ultimatum is basically about a cast of characters looking for closure. Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) wants to find out what happened to him in the past, or his life will remain the way it isalways running, always hiding. Going after him is a top government official Noah Vosen (David Strathairn), whose closure is finding the wanted assassin dead. Re-seeking closure in the midst of the hunt are familiar faces Pamela Landy (Joan Allen) and Nicky Parsons (Julia Stiles) who want the entire ordeal to be over once and for all and on peaceful terms. This chase runs through a good portion of the entire planet; jumps from Moscow to London to Morocco and finds it way back into the United States. One would think that with all these nice places we could stop and admire the scenery, but Greengrass wants us enjoying the conflict, not the landscapeleading to less than two seconds of overview footage of the current location.Matt Damon does an excellent job portraying Jason Bourne once again. His delivery is icy cold and merciless, as well as his fighting and his espionage skills. Yet underneath the tough exterior lies a torn man that has no idea what has happened to him, diminishing his trust in other people and his willingness to communicate. The other performances were good as well, notably Strahairn and Stiles. In terms of summer blockbusters, this movie has some of the best acting, nothing feels or sounds forced. The soundtrack in the Bourne Ultimatum is also superb, as it blends orchestrated work with the occasional techno and trance.Paul Greengrass is back with the shaky cam, but this time its just as frenzied as ever. While the camera does slow down during the calmer and more emotionally driven moments, the action scenes make up for it with a violent case of camera thrashing. The camera vibrates like its been through an earthquake, it gets hammered by props, gets a beating during the fight scenes, and ultimately has you right smack dab in the middle of the insanity. The technique is hit-and-miss, but here it works very well because you can actually see the subjects and you do not get confused as to who is who. Greengrass also directs one of the best foot chases in a very long time; the best chase in the series also turns into the most brutal fight in the series, as Bourne takes on a highly skilled assassin resulting in a fight that is the best in movies in quite some time.We have a much more straightforward plot that is easy to follow in the third installment. Within the first ten minutes, one can be fully caught up with what happened the previous two movies, which is an added plus. Most of the tense scenes involve a bunch of CIA folks in the office trying to figure out Bourne's next move, and that is usually followed by an intense chase. Like the other Bourne movies, there is no remorse or mercy towards the vehicles, as we get not one, but two vehicular chases, both meshed in with on-foot chases. By the end of the chases, we will have unrecognizable cars sprinkled throughout the setting, leaving the viewers gasping for breath. The best part of Bourne Ultimatum (besides the action) is that all questions are answered; all loose ends are tied together. Troy Gilroy and Scott Z. Burns craft a screenplay that may not be as smart or as engaging as the original, but is much easier to follow.Bottom Line: The definitive action movie of the summer has arrived, and stands as one of the smartest action movies since the second installment. Trading in humor and unnecessary subplots for more action and suspense, The Bourne Ultimatum never feels slow, never feels forced, and doesn't bore the audience with unnecessary scenes created to just extend the running time. From the very beginning the conflict is presented; and after visiting half a dozen countries and witnessing jaw-dropping scene after jaw-dropping scene, you will be left desiring more. Fans of the first two movies will not be disappointed, but if you have not seen the first two movies, it is required to watch Identity and Supremacy before enjoying this powerhouse flick. The Bourne Ultimatum is a another great addition to the series, and rises as one of the better movies to come out in 2007.",9,2,5,6 August 2007
Nightcrawler," Superb thriller from the School of Fincher, Nightcrawler is Gylenhall and Gilroy in top form
","David Fincher would be absolutely proud.Nightcrawler is a melancholy subtle thriller that laces fantastic acting with a strong script with plenty to say and wrapped together by tight editing, incredible cinematography, and a moody James Newton Howard (who has been exceptionally busy lately) score that has a very unexpected Ross/Reznor feel. Dan Gilroy's directorial debut is arguably among the best since Shyamalan's Sixth Sense---another impressive debut with the similar under the bubble suspenseful psychological horror that keeps you on edge until the final minutes.How the writer behind Reel Steel and Two for the Money managed to imitate Fincher I'll never know, but it sure does help to have some Oscar-worthy acting at front and center. Jake Gylenhall as Louis Bloom is easily the strongest aspect of the film, as his character is like a bone-crushing car accident: brutal, uneasy to look at, but you still can't look away. This is Gylenhall's movie easily, as his cold eyes, anti-social demeanor, and psychotic way of life makes his character one of the best you'll see in cinema nowadays.Similar to how End of Watch (AlsoJake Gylenhall) took a known lifestyle and then displayed the grim dark side of it, Nightcrawler chronicles the late-night lives of people that record and deliver the late-night news—while simultaneously showing the ugly underbelly mannerisms behind what you see on television. Dan Gilroy's script pulls no punches as he not only writes an interesting character in an interesting premise, but also interweaves some clever and biting commentary about the pursuit of success and the murky morality during the rise to the top.But the movie never appears preachy because it still has a good story to tell, and consistently prevents you from figuring out how far, how deep, and how wicked it goes. Nightcrawler has a slow yet steady pace as it morphs from a glimpse of a lifestyle to a scenario that stems from it. The ascetics enhance the mood as the cinematography transforms Los Angeles into an eerie environment with heinousness creeping out of the dark corners everywhere. What is more surprising than Gilroy's superb directing debut is Howard's score which deviates far from his normal blockbuster orchestral feel and gives us a low-volume high-intensity score that undermines and bubbles under the silent terror of the hunt for grisly footage.What honestly kills some of Nightcrawler's momentum in the Oscar run and attempt to be the best film of the year is ironically David Fincher and Gone Girl. Gone Girl not only came out first, but also has the biting commentary that oozes out of its script, superb directing, and a phenomenal musical score that ties together a story that has few heroes, and even fewer chances of the audience figuring out its next direction. Gilroy makes a grand entrance, too bad it had to follow up the master of the broody underground cinema scene—similar to how the wonderful David Bowie had to unfortunately follow (and never have a chance to surpass) Queen's legendary performance in Live Aid 1985.However it is cruel to bring up another movie when the one currently being discussed is still a great work of cinema. Gylenhall, Gilroy, and Howard are Oscar-worthy as their skills blend together to create one of the best films of the year, and a hell of a thriller overall. Even if the ending underwhelms and dissatisfies a little, there is no denying that Nightcrawler will leave an impression on you from the character of Louis to the slick writing and camera-work that perfectly unites him and the midnight environment slums from which he comes from.Nightcrawler is dark, dark chocolate: satisfying, fulfilling, and with that nice bitter aftertaste.",8,2,7,2 November 2014
Burn After Reading," 'So what did we learn from this?' 'Um... I don't know. '
","There are movies that teach you absolutely nothing, no matter what anyone says. I've been taught that every movie has a theme. Not this one. Burn After Reading is an extremely quirky tale about several lives running into each other because of a lost disk containing slews of classified information. The CD results in several gym employees heading into trouble, several adulteries being unraveled, mysterious activities emerging, and Russians joining in on the mayhem. However, we still learn nothing. The Coen Brothers ease the tension and stock up on the laughs as they write and direct a very original and unpredictable story about stupidity, and the consequences that follow. Like previously stated, classified information owned by a recently-demoted C.I.A. agent (John Malkovich) is found by a couple of gym employees (Brad Pitt, Francis McDormand). Seeing it as a chance to earn some money, the gym employees ask for cash but things become complicated when the employees threaten to take the information elsewhere if they don't get a certain kind of reward. Many other characters are dragged into the situation under different circumstances; ranging from martial connections to being at the wrong place at the wrong time. The Coen Brothers have had quite a repertoire of unique movies, and this one is no different. Blending suspense with dark comedy, mystery, and sequences of gut-wrenching violence, Burn After Reading is unlike the typical movie with a coherent plot and a clear image of where the film is going. The dialogue itself is realistic, witty, but suffers from too much profanity. This sounds childish or like an overprotective mother, but if you don't need to curse, why do it? Why do f-bombs have to scatter all over the movie like bad dandruff? This was the biggest issue with The Departed; it's a great script embezzled with the urge to spew so many dirty words it leaves the film with a bad smell. There's not enough soap in this planet for movies like Burn After Reading. The all-star cast in Burn After Reading carries this movie more than anything else, even the content material. Brad Pitt is hilarious as the klutzy Chad, and Francis McDormand also shines as the airheaded and superficial co-worker of Chad. Everyone else, from the small roles of J.K. Simmons and Tilda Swinton, to the larger roles of George Clooney and John Malkovich did a respectable job bringing the tale to life. The Coen Brothers are excellent in fleshing out good performances from their cast; as for over two decades they have been responsible for filming amazing performances. So good cast, decent writing, interesting story, what's wrong then? Well, it's all rather boring. The story, concept is good, but the execution was rather poor. Even at 96 minutes, it feels a bit on the stretchy side as there are several scenes that weren't very necessary, and when we could have used more screen time, the flick is over. There are times in which we have minutes of footage that doesn't even progress the story forward. Last but not least, the more entertaining characters actually appear less than the more serious ones (the supporting cast pretty much). The quirky surprises and plot twists can keep your eyes open for only so long. Then there's the musical score, which doesn't quite mesh well with the entire movie. The Big Lebowski this is not, Intolerable Cruelty was even slightly more entertaining thanks to the chemistry created by Clooney and Zeta-Jones. This movie was full of chuckles, but no major laugh-out-loud moments unlike in Lebowski. A bit of 'heh,''hee-hee,' but no 'LOL.' Yea, that previous sentence would get me fired from any newspaper but that's the best way to describe Burn After Reading: light fluffy laughter that doesn't exactly add up to a worthy comedy. Then there is the ending; which has subtle nods to the finale of No Country For Old Men. This is a hit-and-miss decision by the Coen Brothers, but it comes off as tacky, short, and underwhelming.Bottom Line: Good cast, good story, poor execution. This is nowhere near as strong as No Country For Old Men, nor is it worthy of being a cult comedy classic like Big Lebowski and Raising Arizona. This is best suited as a small rental when there is nothing else to do on a stormy Monday evening. All of the characters here aren't very likable nor are they quote-worthy, with the lone exception of Brad Pitt's character, which even then you don't see much of. It was a 'cluster****' of a movie, but one I wasn't that heavily engaged in. Being different and daring to break the movie-making rules is good, but when you defer so far from the original formula you might create a recipe that is too foreign for even your biggest fans. Burn After Reading: Eh.P.S. Where's Steve Bescumi?",5,1,4,22 September 2008
Watchmen," A tough pill to swallow, Watchmen will have you choking and gasping for air as the third act rolls around.
","In any sort of entertainment, you need to finish strong. Your song, speech, video game, movie, television show needs to finish out on top, wrap things up nicely---whether optimistically or pessimistically. Methods of entertainment can start slow, maybe even build slow, but should not, at any given moment finish slowly or in a weak matter. Watchman unfortunately fails to do this; and it's worse considering that the subject matter is such a highly-acclaimed one. While Watchman was a tough pill to swallow in the beginning and the middle, it becomes unbearably awful in the final act, and quite frankly demolishes any chance of this matching up to the comic book we so love.Watchman is about a retired group of superheroes coming together after the murder of one of their own, The Comedian. With the silent investigation headed by Rorschach (Jackie Earle Haley), he reveals that the murder is part of something much bigger than just a random act of violence. In the meantime, the other superheroes are having a lot of trouble adapting to real life after their fame and fortune passed; while the United States is inches away from nuclear war. The themes explored here and unlike that of the typical comic book fare; themes of fate, God, destiny, war, apocalypse, and sacrifice are crucial to the entire plot and throughout the film remain a hot topic. David Hayter and Alex Tse had the tough job of being able to translate the massive comic book into film within a suitable running time.Let's at least praise the effects. While a blue male bearing it all dozens of times isn't exactly to my liking, the special effects in Watchmen are indeed quite spectacular. While it lacks the visual style and edge of 300 or Sin City, they remain a sight to see. The highly stylized fights aren't as lengthy as Zack Snyder's previous comic adaptation, but are still fun to watch. The hits, strikes, and beatdowns are especially gruesome, cringe-worthy in some instances. Zack Snyder knows what keeps his audience riveted and sprinkles a few nasty fights from time to time to keep us on our toes.The acting itself is grand as well, especially that of Jackie Earle Haley, who plays Rorschach. Not only is his character the best fleshed-out character, but also is the one that steals the spotlight the most with good delivery, funny one-liners, and more raw emotion than any other actor and actress on screen. Everyone else did a respectable job, although some of the extras are laughable when they shouldn't be.Watchmen's downfall is definitely the complexity of it all. While a complex story is riveting most of the time, you must be able to guide the audience in a certain direction so that it doesn't look like the film is suffering a seizure and is mixing up the chronological order like shuffling of cards. The pacing of the film is extremely slow, and likes to reach into the past without giving you a hintage of warning. It becomes lingering and even annoying at times, although it does develop the main characters a bit more. The pacing is uneven because quick-paced fights are blending in with the slow scenes of excessive dialogue, backstory, and character progress. With the exception of Rorschach, there is little to care about, we don't feel much of a connection with the characters. Snyder did a decent job explaining a lot in a few moments (See the opening credits) but then adds unnecessary scenes and elongated scenes.Then comes the third act. The entire film falls apart like a bad game of Jenga. The pacing totally grinds into a halt, the ending comes much too slowly, nothing is explained, no emotions will come out of you, there are unnecessary fights, and quite frankly we the audience just flat-out stopped caring for anyone. Literally, you'd have to have extensive knowledge of the comic book in order to have a better appreciation of the whole body of work itself. However, it's a flaw for us as an audience to have to do research in order to receive full enjoyment out of a film. People started walking out of the theater, people start squirming more in their seats, and as the credits rolled, silence filled the cinema.Bottom Line: In order to watch the Watchmen and actually care, you must read Watchmen. It sounds very obvious, but The Dark Knight is a well-accepted and loved film, and I can guarantee you that most of the viewers hadn't honesty read a Batman comic book. The difference is we cared for Batman and his companions. In this case, we honestly don't, because they tried explaining so much, and chose the wrong things to explainleading to characters with weak and little development, unnecessary scenes, and a lack of connection with our heroes. The themes are explored but not fully fleshed out, the plot itself is accurate but also lacks a true interpretation, and the final act just damages the entire film.Zack Snyder has the energy to make comic books scream to life with entertainment (as proved in 300) but just didn't end Watchmen well at all. The ending may alienate some, but will frustrate more. 150+ minutes is long enough, no need to make it worse by dragging it by its knuckles. Beware of slow pacing and a very convoluted, complicated plot that will require previous knowledge, multiple viewings, and lot of patience.Then a tolerance for disappointment.",4,26,52,6 March 2009
Little Miss Sunshine," A very grim and dark story told in a most adorable fashion, Little Miss Sunshine is a charming little film with heart but flaws as well
","Little Miss Sunshine went from a tiny personal independent film to one of many of the 'little films that could' back in 2006. Working on a small budget and not much press, it would emerge as a sleeper hit at the box office and would prove to be a highly-praised effort by the well-known directing duet Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris. Mixing comedy (quite dark actually) with a heavy hint of drama, Little Miss Sunshine is one of those rare decent dark comedies and a rare decent road trip movie. But, despite all that, its not perfect. Billed as a comedy but coming off much more as a depressing dramedy, Little Miss Sunshine suffers from an unbalanced blend of genres, a few slow moments, and an ending that doesn't really complete the story. As a matter of fact, the ending just screams indie and could have been seen from a mile away. At this point, the conclusion may have just been spoiled, if you've seen enough of these lower-budgeted, 'unformulatic' films.In Little Miss Sunshine, we follow a very dysfunctional and depressed family full of oddballs that are hitting bumps in life. Whether its depression, divorce, long vow of silence, drugs, or lack of motivation, there is almost every kind of unfortunate scenario and situation within the family. The glue keeping everyone together is the adorable daughter Olive (Abigail Breslin), who just happens to be able to enter a beauty pageant for smaller kids. The rest of the family unites together, despite their anger, frustration, and tension amongst each other to help Olive attempt to claim her moment in the spotlight.Running the show is the superb acting from practically everybody. From veterans Alan Arkin and Greg Kinnear to up-and-coming stars like Steve Carell, Paul Dano, and Abigail Breslin, excellent casting and even better acting runs Little Miss Sunshine and is its standout feature. None of them truly stand out, but they all blend in together with the chaos and drama going on throughout the film. It was fascinating how in one moment, they can make you laugh, and in the next moment make you cry.Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris are excellent directors in the field of music videos. Within the past decade, some of the better music videos come from them. With Little Miss Sunshine however, their creativity and usage of visual effects isn't utilized here, but instead their skills in terms of capturing emotion is used at full blast. Capturing scenery was no problem, as the duo made art out of everyday backgrounds. They kept the pacing quick and consistent, and refrained from taking any long shots unless its bits with no dialogue.The problem with this movie is the writing and the story in general. Dark comedies can be hard to find, since accidentally crossing the line past dark comedy leads to drama. Little Miss Sunshine aims to be a cute and charming film, but with so much gruesome drama and so much cynical humor, it ends up becoming a gruesome look at life and a rather grim tale of everything going wrong when it shouldn't. Its dark comedy is hard to laugh at sometimes when the dysfunctional family continuously hits roadblocks on the way to the pageant. Kind of like the main weakness of Pursuit of Happiness, Little Miss Sunshine suffers from way too much drama. But, unlike Pursuit, the film has practically no closure in any of the subplots and the bad news that keeps charging into the film every couple of minutes. Topping all the grief is lack of closing as the film ends very abruptly.Bottom Line: Great directing and great acting couldn't save the movie from having a rather bittersweet taste towards the end. What was a decent story in the beginning disintegrated into an incomplete body of fiction that screams indie and a potentially unnecessary sequel. Little Miss Sunshine is one of those rare films that is cute and dark at the same time, like a Gothic Red Riding Hood with big innocent eyes. We see a lot of careers rising out of this, and directors successfully crossing into another field of entertainment, but not an instant classic that shall be adored for generations. Best Picture nomination? How did it get that? Little Miss Sunshine: Good, but not uber fantastic.",6,1,4,21 March 2007
Over the Hedge," Fun when it wants to be, boring when it wants to deliver a message, Over the Hedge is no Madagascar, but is better than previous animated films
","Dreamworks, the anti-Disney, is a hit-miss animation company that sometimes delivers few of among the best animated films, but sometimes also flounder by delivering some stinkers. Shrek and Madagascar were excellent animated films that deserve to be in every large 'best animated movies' list. But, there are also disasters like Shark Tale and also the disappointing Shrek 2. Over the Hedge is not a classic by any means, but it is entertaining enough to keep you awake throughout the short 83 minutes. The voice talent was all there, the writing was there, but the pacing kind of ruins it for a short time. Unfortunately, the sentimental value has to always be thrown in, and the movie totally slows down during those sappy, slow, unhappy moments. But, when a chase scene arrives, prepared to be dazzled and very amused. Thank goodness the third act picks up the tempo as it lifts the film from total mediocrity and dissatisfaction into a nice, charming film that is worthy of watching more than once.Over the Hedge is about a mischievous raccoon named RJ that gets caught trying to steal food from an angry bear, and has a few days to come up with all the food after it all gets destroyed. In the meantime, animals that woke up from hibernation wake up to discover that most of their forest had been turned into a neighborhood. RJ tries to lure the dumbfounded animals into getting all the food he needs, but paranoid turtle named Verne and some surprising circumstances get in the way. A little-known fact about the movie is that it is actually based off a comic strip of the same name.Kind of like what happened with Madagascar, the writing team didn't have to work much on the dialogue, since most of the humor is visual. Either way, they try to sneak by with a few one-liners here and there. Unlike Madagascar ('Well this sucks') the one-liners tend to fall flat. Also, the low points of the movie all happen in the first two acts, when they were just conversing, when the possums were not being funny, or when the themes and sad moments occur, which there unusually plenty of in the first half. Most of the laughs in the first half came from the squirrel Hammy, which actually wasn't as funny as the hyperactive squirrel Twitchy in the surprisingly funny Hoodwinked.The action and the laughs totally come rolling in when the final act comes in, and the climax rapidly approaches. Almost every character has their moment to shine and deliver humorous moments, even the dry-witted, almost totally boring turtle. The action/chase sequences are well done, well choreographed, as they showcase moments that you really would never expect from any kind of movie. The voice talent finally flexes its acting and hilarity muscles in the final twenty minutes. Also towards the end we see Hammy at his fastest, and that most certainly was a delight. There is an underlying subliminal message in Over the Hedge, and it deals with America's obsession with food, big cars, and never-ending urge to fulfill its desires.Bottom Line: Decent, but really gets good towards the end, which is quite the opposite from the typical summer movie, in which the ending usually falls kind of flat. While it is no Madagascar from the year before, it is still much better than Blue Sky's latest effort, Ice Age 2, and way better than Disney's previous effort, Chicken Little. Excellent casting here, even though they truly do not show their stuff until much later in the film, especially Allison Janney as the stereotypical angry, workaholic single woman. If you can sit through some of the boredom in the beginning the payoff will be sweet as we see one fun sequence after the other, ranging from a dog chasing some of the animals to modern-day-usually awful drive gone totally wrong. Dreamworks is heading in the right direction with back-to-back decent flicks. Over the Hedge: over-the-top, and out-of-control, when it wants to be.",7,4,5,8 June 2006
Wanted," 'This movie is painful.' Ambar.
","The above statement made by my friend best describes the madness that lurks within Wanted. The recent rise of the number of no-holds-barred rated-R flicks takes center stage here as we experience one ruthless gutsy film that meshes stylistic choices of The Matrix, the Bourne series, Fight Club, and even 300. If you enjoy a good portion of unrealistic yet jaw-dropping action then this is the flick for you. However, it is not a mindless action movie, which it a turn-off to those that want to shut off their brain and enjoy the carnage within. Wanted is a decent flick full of attitude, pain, torture, bullets, and more bullets. Did I mention the bullets? Based off a comic book mini-series printed in 2003, Wanted follows a lonely, stressed, high-anxiety bottled-up blue-collar worker (This description screams LOSER) by the name of Wesley. Wesley constantly questions the world around him and his existence, but finds refuge during a brush with death after meeting the beautifully mysterious Fox. Fox introduces him to a secret league of assassins with special abilities, and there they discover that the son of one of these under-the-radar killers happens to be Wesley; and yes he has the potential to be something big. This new change in life has Wesley thirsty for more, yet the further he plunges into this underworld, the darker the motives become.We've had several lower-profiled strong action movies in previous years, but this one rises above all of them in terms of plot. Usually an action movie has a simple plot to set the film in motion, and the plot never weaves a web of uncertainty and surprises. Wanted drifts in another direction by offering plot twist after plot twist in the midst of all the action pieces. The script, well-written by Michael Brandt and Derek Haas, not only gives us a good adaptation of the comic book, but also thrusts all these questions about the morality of assassins in the 110 minutes. A thinking action movie? Does this actually exist? The acting is also good for a movie of its type. The main star James McAvoy hides his accent perfectly and does a good job portraying the tortured soul Wesley. While Angeline Jolie seems to have more screen time in the trailers than in the movie itself, she also plays her role well. Jolie will make you drool over her body, yet at the same time make you fear her because of her sharp eyes that can crush a soul. Morgan Freedman never disappoints, and delivers easily the best line in the movie (Don't expect it to be mentioned here). Timur Bekmambetov runs the show well by giving us nice long action sequences, and by fiddling with the speed of the movie many times. The energy presented on-screen more than makes up for the obvious displays of special effects and slower moments in the flick.However, there is a little-known flick that came out in September 2007 that delivers the same kind of over-the-top action, except much more of it. If you had not seen it, then it won't leave you disappointed in Wanted. But, if you did see Shoot Em' Up, you can't help but get the 'What if' feeling when watching this movie. Wanted is decent, but is structured like an introductory film of a potential franchise; much like Iron Man, The Incredible Hulk, Spider-Man, Batman Begins, among others. Shoot Em' Up offers action only two minutes into the movie. Wanted could have been something really special if they threw away training montages and exchanged them with more assassinations, more insane amounts of action, and more bullets. Bekmambetov knows how to craft a good scene, and the best example is the final major gunfight towards the end of the movie (Prepared to have your jaw drop). Shoot Em' Up's lack of success can be attributed to no major stars, lack of marketing, and perhaps bad timingnot because of the quality. Just like Iron Man back in May, Wanted is good, but could have been so much better if we hadn't required time for introduction and transition from loser to killer. Wanted 2, if it comes, automatically has the advantage by not requiring backstory or set-up.Bottom Line: Don't let the last paragraph upset you, because odds are you never saw Shoot Em' Up, and odds are you'll enjoy Wanted regardless. But, if you did, Wanted goes by this equation: Wanted = Shoot Em' Up + Plot + Angelina Jolie + Morgan Freedman  Action Scenes  Intense Irony  Insane villain.Basically, Wanted is a good flick that sets up what can be one heck of a sequel. The director and writers have already proved that they can weave some intense action moments, so if the executives are smart, they would keep these men around. In the meantime, this movie is worthy of our hard-earned money as long as you are willing to be blown away and entertained yet at the same time think a little. Wanted earns a 7/10 from me, but a high 7/10.",7,0,3,30 June 2008
Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa," The animation was better, there is a stronger story, there is more heart....but....
","The original Madagascar was a break from the typical mold in family animated entertainment; it was fearless, didn't slow down to teach a lesson, and was not afraid of entertaining solely on physical humor. The content was light, but it was so satisfying that it wound up being Dreamwork's second best animated movie of them allbehind Shrek. The zany cast of characters easily exceeds the number of memorable characters in Shrek, and contained more humor and creativity than all of the other Dreamworks animated flicks before and ever since.In the second installment, you see the writers trying to give the franchise a dosage of heart and sentimentality, which is what made Shrek the instant classic it became. A bit of heart can definitely propel an animated movie into masterpiece status (see Toy Story and Finding Nemo) however this is not the franchise to do it. Madagascar is about the cast and how they interact with each other and the conflict that is presented onto them. While the laughs are definitely here, the attempt for emotion constantly makes this film slows down and keeps it from being a superior installment when placed against the original. That being said, it's still a fun, entertaining, and unpredictable movie that continues the zaniness that made the original a personal guilty pleasure of mine.In Escape 2 Africa, we follow the New York zoo animals, the psychotic penguins, the monkeys, and the lemur leaders as they unexpectedly are stranded in the middle of Africa. While at first the main four (Marty, Alex, Melman, Gloria) are rather happy at their new environment, they quickly realize that it's not all that it seems, and that their new temporary home is splitting the four apart. In the meantime, the penguins attempt to repair the plane that they accidentally destroyed. The writers did a good job in presenting all sorts of new gags and yet again refrain from referencing pop culture too much (although the Twilight Zone nod was hilarious). But, they couldn't deliver the emotional impact because of one main reason: this franchise wasn't meant to ever slow down in terms of pacing. Like a roller coaster, this movie moves sometimes extremely fast, and then can grind into a halt in the next scene. Lastly the main four don't interact much with each other, but more with the environment. There literally are at least 8 plots happening at oncesome of them are good, some of them aren't.The voice acting remains decent, but there are fewer lines by the original cast, and more from supporting characters and new characters. Bernie Mac, rest in peace, but his performance was rather bland and could have been done by anyone else. Alec Baldwin didn't have much of a chance to lend his comedic skills either. Yet again, the penguins and Sacha Baron Cohen steal every scene they are in, no matter how mediocre the previous scene was. Cohen (as Julien) has an obvious knack for comedy, and delivers every line perfectly for two movies in a row; not bad at all. Ben Stiller had fewer chances at being funny, as they had to handle all the major slower moments. Chris Rock's role was surprisingly limited, especially for someone who did so well in the original.The one major improvement from the original was the animation, which was crisp, fluid, and flowed better. Surely it's undeniably no Wall-E (Or even 2007's Ratatouille), but it's still respectably an improvement over previous work. The jokes themselves are hit-and-miss like the original; the only difference is this one has more misses. Plus it's the recurring jokes that are missing; the hula girl, feisty tourist, repetitive herd, and lion-dancing bits all didn't elicit much laughter from the audience, nor from me. We just needed much more Julien, and much more penguin-action. Maybe in the future the focus will shift; in the meantime they are just grabbing all the spotlight and attention.Bottom Line: Exactly what Scrat did to Ice Age: The Meltdown years ago, we have minor/supporting characters becoming the main hit and running the show. While the original four characters take a backseat and add emotion to a franchise that's too fast-paced for this sort of stuff, we have the penguins and Julien taking over the movie and keeping it from being another totally disappointing animated sequel like every straight-to-video Disney sequel, the ugly Shrek sequels, or Ice Age 2. The entertainment level is still magnificent the second time around, but it won't age as well as the first Madagascar did. Leave the heart to Pixar, because those folks have nailed it perfectly for years. Dreamworks can serve as the escapist cinema in terms of animation, but if they continue imitating and try to outdo Pixar, it will just dampen the quality of all their movies. Madagascar 2 is the prime example of this: purely fun and entertaining until it tries to distribute family values. Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa is also proof that those hilarious penguins need their own movie, pretty much immediately.Yes, right now.",7,44,69,10 November 2008
Duck Soup," Pure Old-School Cinematic Madness
","Duck Soup would have been a bonafide comedic piece of art if it wasn't so damn frustrating.The Marx Brothers on top of their game are zany, unpredictable, out-of-control, and full so many jokes, physical missteps and timely innuendo that you sometimes need to slow them down to catch everything. A modern equivalent would be Robin Williams at his stand-up prime. The Brothers do indeed deliver the laughs, they do indeed contain the necessary energy to motivate and drive a production---but if there isn't cooler heads providing some structure to the movie then you are in for a chaotic hour.Enter Duck Soup.Duck Soup is a whirlwind of jokes, satire, and little cherished moments that have stood the test of time and has cemented as a comedic classic amongst the contemporary film critics (because the reviews back in the 30s were a bit stagnant). However, there is absolutely no moment in which you see any progress towards a rising action, a climax, or a conclusion. Surely there is some humor to enjoy but the act gets a little tiring even with a shorter running time. You can assume that there is a writer and director all you want, but every viewer knows that the Marx Brothers had a firm grip on where the movie was going.Marx Brothers would have been the greatest sketch comedy show in the history of mankind if they had their peak during television as opposed to peaking in stage and early post-silent film. Sadly, we'll never know. But their shtick is prime television material, but somewhat tougher to chew when translated into a lengthy motion picture. Can you imagine Saturday Night Live being 90 minutes? Chappelle Show being 90 minutes? Even Adult Swim programs being 90 minutes? It wouldn't work, even if the smaller pieces are funny and do entertain. This is arguably why Saturday Night Live movies (Outside of Blues Brothers and Wayne's World) never ever work.The greatest comedies of all-time have their best moments interwoven with the plot. Even Caddyshack, a comedy that loosely connects to the main plot, still feels a little...organized. Duck Soup is like bringing a paintball gun that launches 900 pellets a second---surely most will hit but the rest will go flying everywhere. Jokes are all over this movie to a point you have to duck and cover. But unlike their better works like Night at the Opera, the Marx Brothers never give you a chance to recover, to breathe, to be brought back to earth. It is a good comedy, Groucho Marx once again uses his rapid-fire delivery and flawless comedic timing, but the entire ordeal can be quite nerve-wrecking to witness.",6,0,3,25 October 2013
We're the Millers," The NBC alums save this promising comedy from totally drowning
","With a terrible cast, this movie would have been a downright disaster.With an excellent cast, this movie would have been mediocre.We're the Millers has a decent cast, and it almost saves the movie from being a weak summer comedy with an intriguing premise. Unfortunately the script was too distorted, the laughs were too far in between, and there is a cringe factor and an unnecessary force-fed sentimental taint that doesn't allow for the insane movie to breathe. For a unique movie (Four different people posing as a family to cross the border with drugs), this movie has a lot of clichés. Tons of awkward sex jokes, tons of awkward sexual moments, and all the minimal clichés you see in tired and effortless comedies clutter this overblown production.But like I said before, the cast definitely makes up for most of the shortcomings. Jason Sudeikis has the charm to cover the general disgusting personality of his character. Jennifer Aniston has enough appeal to cover the all-to-common stripper-with-heart-of-gold routine (and enough to spread around all of California). The rest of the cast does pretty well with the material they are given, with special nods to Nick Offerman. Even after the comedy rolls past 100 minutes (News to Comedic Writers: comedies should never run past 90 minutes unless you really have a good concept) you will warm up enough to the cast to care about their whereabouts.The movie's idea could have definitely worked as a stoner road comedy.Instead, the movie comes off as disjointedly sex-driven and unnecessarily crude comedy whose main McGuffin becomes a pure afterthought. For a movie about a drug dealer, they definitely cut back on drug humor while focusing more on the male anatomy. Well, this is what happens when four different people write the script. Although Rawson Marshall Thurber didn't fumble the directing job, he didn't add any style or cleverness to the film.We're The Millers does have its laughs; it does have its moments, and underneath the drudge has a hintage of charm. But, between these positives are plenty of negatives including inconsistency, too much of the crude humor, and its smuggling of clichés. Similar to Identity Thief, this movie can actually benefit from a remake down the road and not because of the quality of the original, but because of the promising premise that tumbled upon arrival.",5,11,27,8 August 2013
Silver Linings Playbook," Inspiring drama with plenty of flair from start to finish
","Truthfully, the only reason I watched this movie was to see how a seemingly cut-and-paste drama could land their director an Oscar nod above the more ambitious and creative Tarantino.Silver Linings Playbook however deserves its Oscar nods, and almost even deserved that Best Director nod. With a nice realistic script and fantastic performances to follow, Silver Linings Playbook is one of the superior dramas of 2012 by combining plenty of raw emotion with charm and even some humor to ease the pain. Bradley Cooper shines as a saddened bipolar man that moves in with his parents to try to get his life together. What follows are the interactions and behavioral changes amongst everyone around him after the several months he spent away in psychiatric care. And along the way he meets a woman (Jennifer Lawrence) that might be equally as much of a mess, but also equally in need of a good friend. Based off a Matthew Quick novel, it's much more drama than anything else but the characters will grow on you and will have you rooting for them on the final act.David O. Russell is getting quite good at pulling off great performances from his cast, as he got a couple Oscars from his last movie The Fighter. This time around Bradley Cooper gives the best performance of his career by providing layers of likability even during his worst of moments and moments of detachment, while Jennifer Lawrence and Robert DeNrio are expectedly but still undeniably electric. The chemistry amongst everyone in the film is what carries this movie throughout and past the dimmest and slowest of moments, when the movie starts to drag a bit in the final third. Russell doesn't have much to work with to flex the directing muscles, but gets the job done by providing calm basic cinematography while also tugging the heartstrings when necessary. Overall, this movie is a good drama, pure and simple. It never becomes overly complex and bloated, it's just a straight up entertaining drama with an assortment of standout moments that swings past all the issues of running time and some fluff scenes. Silver Linings Playbook is a grounded drama that stands as one of the best of the year.",8,2,5,13 January 2013
Shrek Forever After," Makes you forget and forgive the existence of the third Shrek, even when it still falters against the original
","The Shrek franchise has risen from a good competitor against Disney and Pixar to a mere joke that still makes money because it appeals to the kids. By the time the third Shrek rolled around, the green ogre went from a clever family comedy with subtle adult humor to an unfunny kiddie flick with very little entertainment whatsoever. This is why I was prepared to shun and practically avoid the fourth and final installment beyond any means necessary. Unfortunately for us moviegoers though, the month of May offered practically nothing outside the Iron Man (and maybe Prince of Persiamaybe) realm. And with the next major major release not happening until mid-June, Shrek Goes Fourth was the final option. Now, there are some good news and bad news with the final installment. The good news is this film redeems itself for the rather mediocre sequel and the repulsive third one. The bad news is, the film still is weaker than anything Pixar (and quiet third party Blue Sky) has produced, and even weaker then some of Dreamworks' greatest hits. At least the sentimental value and heart of the original is duplicated here, even if the wit and nonstop humor disappeared. The pop culture references aren't as rampant but aren't as good either, while the random musical numbers and dances just don't cut it like they used to. Despite all that griping, it still remains a ho-hum ending to a ho-hum quadrilogy. In Shrek Forever After or whatever it is called nowadays, we follow Shrek (Mike Myers) as he is becoming quite bored of his watered-down lifestyle of being a father, husband, and town hero. In the midst of the frustrations, he makes a deal with Rumpelstilskin, resulting in him creating a world in which he was never born---resulting in Rumpelstilskin being king of the land. In this alternate universe, he must win the heart of Fiona (Cameron Diaz) all over again before his existence begins to deteriorate. One funny note though, there is no mention of Artie and his new reign of king.The script is a small retread of the original, mixed in with It's a Wonderful Life and even unexpected parallels to Beauty and the Beast. In other words, the script isn't very original, but does offer a chance to inject some heart into a franchise that lost all of it a couple of years ago. Written by John Klausner (Shrek the Third) and Darren Lemke (Lost), this final chapter has a lot of references to the original Shrek and its sequel, while avoiding all the Disney-bashing the first three were known for. Sadly though, outside the Disney bashing, Shrek didn't have a lot of humor, which makes this Shrek one of the weaker ones in terms of humor. The laughs are mildly there, but mostly coming from the supporting cast (Once again, Antonio Banderas as Puss in Boots stealing the show). With Shrek losing his main love and struggling to win her again, the heartstrings are tugged a bit. Director Mike Mitchell paces the movie well by quickly showing the source of Rumpilstilskin's rage as well as the source of Shrek's troubles. While American Beauty jump-started the middle aged-crisis thing to holy heaven back in 1999, Shrek Forever After still remains a bit fresh by giving us a little time and alternate universe travel. While I was never a fan of Dreamworks trying to infuse heart into any of their movies (I see them more as the antidepressant of Pixar's excellent but heart-destroying films), Shrek is a definite exception. The core of the four films has been the characters and their love for each other, so when the climax approaches, expect to be a bit moved, even when you haven't been laughing. Bottom Line: Shrek's final trip into the movie theaters was better than I had expected, but still wasn't as funny as the first two, which is what I did expect. You can run on competitive bashing and pop culture humor for so long before you quickly run out of steam. While I believe this fairy tale ran two movies too long, the finale is definitely worthy of a viewing if you love the green ogre and all his friends. The supporting cast provided the laughs, while the main characters provided the heart. This is by no means a triumph, but isn't a total toad wreck either. Dreamworks however really needs to lay off the pace-breaking and unfunny and uninteresting musical bits. Let the spin-offs begin!",6,1,3,4 June 2010
Ratatouille," Much more complete than the average movie, Ratatouille is a 7-course meal providing nothing but the best in animation and storytelling
","The only way this movie could not be enjoyed is if you watch it on an empty stomach. The folks of Pixar deliver what just might be the most complete animated film since Toy Story 2. By complete, we are talking the full course, not just story and humor. With flawless animation, a brilliant score, the best voice talent in ages, an excellent script, a nice story, plenty of humor, a dosage of romance, and a rather surprising amount of realism, and a heartwarming ending, Ratatouille is the best Cinderella story from Disney sinceCinderella. From the director of The Incredibles and from a studio that has delivered hit after hit after hit, it is no wonder why Disney spent so much money purchasing them. This was a tough-to-sell concept executed beautifully, poetically, and just might become the best film of the entire year. The only problem is that this movie sets the bar even higher for animated films from here on out.Ratatouille follows Remy (Patton Oswalt), a rat who wants to become a good cook instead of a good food thief (like his father and co.) and will attempt to do so with his special smelling abilities. After a mishap where he lives, he winds up underneath Paris, close to the restaurant of his mentor, the recently deceased Gusteau (Brad Garrett). Using the garbage boy of the ex-5-star restaurant Linguini (Lou Romano), he attempts to spread his talent of cooking. Conflicts arise when the head chef Skinner (Ian Holm) suspects the sudden rise of fame in Linguini's cooking and realizes his true worth. More conflicts arise when the only female chef becomes romantically involved with Linguini; Remy is having trouble returning to the lifestyle of a rat, and a well-known yet stern critic Ego (Peter O'Toole) decides to make a return into the spotlight.What makes Ratatouille stand tall with some of Pixar and even Disney's best works is the heavily detailed animation, that results in some of the most breathtaking chases and scenes and also results in plenty of concealed visual humor (Check out the structure of Ego's office). From the hairs of the rats to the water flowing to the food that looks good enough to eat, this is Pixar outperforming itself in terms of computer animation. Then we have the best casting since Finding Nemo. Once again focusing more on talent rather than star power, we have an excellent cast of actors and actresses providing the voices. The standout performances come from Peter O'Toole (almost Oscar-worthy), Brad Garrett, Lou Romano, Ian Holm, and Janeane Garofalo.The problem with animated films nowadays is their inability to present a story without having to aim low for a joke or referencing the pop culture of the times. Ratatouille is a living, breathing storybook come to life, and this is thanks to the excellent writing of Brad Bird. Bird combines plenty of conflicts with humor, and also a dosage of realism in terms of the way things are run behind the scenes of a restaurant. Unlike previous summer flicks, Bird perfectly handles the multiple villains in the Cinderella story, which nowadays is a complete rarity (Yes, there is more than one 'villain' in the tale). Clocking in at just less than two hours, it might be a bit long for tykes but after the rather slow beginning, the movie almost instantly picks up once the setting changes. While the humor isn't as sprinkled as in Nemo or Toy Story, it provides plenty of laughs as well as action, drama, and even a little hint of romance. Linguini as a Pinocchio-like chef provide some of the funniest scenes in the whole movie.There just aren't enough words to describe just what makes this movie work, it is presented and handled with such delicacy, it keeps Pixar at the top of the animation kingdom, much to the disdain of Dreamworks, the other competitors, and even the animators at Disney. To craft a movie this good requires time, patience, attention to detail, and a desire to push the limits of animation and storytelling. There is no harder-working company in the movie industry than Pixar, and it shows with each and every single movie it has come out with since 1995; including some of the best films of all-time like Toy Story, Toy Story 2, and Finding Nemo. If the competitors aren't taking notes right now, it is because they don't desire to be the best.Bottom Line: You can only raise the bar higher so many times before not even yourself can reach it. This is what happened with Cars and Monster's Inc., and movies like Ratatouille are the reasons why. While the pacing and running time may be a turnoff for some, the excellent visuals and flawless storytelling more than make up for it. Like a full course meal, Ratatouille has a little bit of everything and much more. The Disney magic that was present back when Disney was alive is in full blast here, which is something that non-Pixar Disney movies lately have not been able to provide. Stop reading this and go enjoy the movie. Ratatouille just made Cars look a bit inferior as it becomes the best animated movie in years, and is potentially the best movie of the entire year. In a summer of sequels, a charming story about a rat with a crazy dream rises to the top of the quality heap.",10,4,6,30 June 2007
Bad Teacher," Let's hope they paid the actors more than the writers.....
","Bad Teacher is a great concept that resulted in a style of humor like most of the Adult Swim cartoons you see today: When the jokes hit they hit well, but when they miss, they miss quite badly. The cast was delightful, but could only go so far with the material. As a matter of fact, it was the cast that saved the movie from being a total disaster by providing their comedic chops, their charm, and their good comic timing that you don't see enough of nowadays. Despite all that however, Bad teacher is a shiny apple with a few rotten parts.Elizabeth Hasley (Cameron Diaz) is a foul-mouthed, bitter, and quite nasty teacher that is keeping the job only to pay the bills after her rich fiancée dumps her. Facing debt, aging, and loneliness, Elizabeth starts setting her sights on a boob job and on a new (rich) teacher (Justin Timberlake), whom has also captured the attention of a manipulative rival (Lucy Punch). The script was helmed by two veteran writers of The Office (Gene Stupnitsky, Lee Eisenberg) as they use their non-television ratings boundaries to mix plenty of vulgar and raunchy humor with even some tidbits of cruel humor. Unfortunately, their lack of boundaries led to a mediocre script.This film's biggest falters come in the form of the script. Despite the promise in the premise and the cast involved, the script was convoluted, and didn't have much structure until the second half. As a matter of fact, the film switches up the pace very unexpectedly when the next act approaches. Pretty much almost all the crude and vulgar humor failed to draw laughs, with one notable exception involving one of the odder 'sex' scenes in recent memory. The movie was a great idea not exactly explored upon, and was full of smaller ideas that were not utilized. Many good smaller characters did not get enough time in the script; most notably the students, the gym teacher (Jason Segal) and the main character's roommate (Erik Stonestreet).Despite the writing being a fickle mess, the cast was superb, from the small roles to the big ones. Cameron Diaz I can honestly say is one of the most underrated talents in Hollywood, because she rarely ever delivers a mediocre or weak performance. She has this aura, this energy that can save the worst of films (See: What Happens in Vegas) and it is no different here. Despite her smoking/drinking/vulgar/manipulative/cynical/cruel/superficial ways, we still secretly root for her to succeed in reaching her goal. Very few actresses can pull off this type of charm.Lucy Punch, despite having a bit of questionable material, delivers as Diaz's rival. Jason Segal could have helped the movie a lot more if he was in it more often, as he delivered the laughs every time he was on-screen with his wit, sarcasm, and I-don't-care attitude. Television staples Phyllis Smith and Erik Stonestreet were hilarious in the far-too-few moments they were on-screen. The movie does indeed have its laughs, but the potential was so much greater considering all the talented actors involved.Jake Kasdan as a director doesn't have much of a resume, but he does have the comedic chops and timing, and he proved this with the underrated Walk Hard. With Bad Teacher, he did not have as much good material to work with but could have still helped the movie if he had tightened the first third of the movie better. There was a lot more unnecessary fluff in the first half of the movie compared to the second half. Smaller plot lines were never resolved, certain jokes literally fell off without a punchline, and certain situations were brought up but never explored. Many concepts were also never explored: especially that of how shallow and shady we all become towards each other in the workforce.Bottom Line: Bad Teacher was a great idea, poorly executed, but relentlessly saved by the energetic cast. This movie could have mixed the dark charm of Bad Santa with the subtle workforce ridiculousness humor of Office Space to become something very, very special. But neither style of humor was dwelled upon deep enough. The first half had its laughs, but was far too convoluted and was salvaged mainly because of the hilarity of Cameron Diaz. The movie definitely picks up later, but by then its too late, the potential was wasted. Either way, you will certainly laugh, you will remain entertained, but will also be bothered by what it could have been.",7,140,237,24 June 2011
The Lego Movie," Creatively out of control, The Lego Movie revives Warner Brothers Animation and gives them a film with Chuck Jones quality
","Now, read the upcoming phrase carefully, because it might come as a bit of a shock.The Lego Movie is the best animated film, and the best overall family film since 2010's Toy Story 3.Pick up your jaw, and hear me out. The Lego Movie screams, embellishes, breathes creativity, heart, and soul that has been lacking severely in most animated movies in recent years. It is a skillfully directed movie that has so much detail you might need multiple viewings to catch all the fun. This movie hits on every single aspect of filmmaking, and took everything that worked on the Disney Renaissance and the Pre-Cars 2 Pixar era and gave it a nice whimsical spin thanks to the concept of the building block toys that stand out in American culture.Where do I start? The Lego Movie is the perfect blend of kids, adult, and nostalgic entertainment that will keep everyone's eyes glued to the screen regardless of age. Whether it's the fun, joyful sounds and colors and visual jokes that will make the kids happy, or all the fun subtle pop culture and nostalgic jabs that will entertain adults, there is something for anyone involved. The animation was astounding and easily has some of the best meticulous visuals since Ratatouille.The best kinds of stories for animated movies are those that start out simple for the tykes, but secretly contain layers of content for the more established minds. This is what made your earlier Pixar movies so appealing for a vast audience; it never talks down to the viewer but doesn't overwhelm the kiddies. In The Lego Movie, what starts out as a simple tale about a prophesy defeating a tyrannical villain from taking over the environment morphs into a beautiful story about finding your voice and being original.Like previously stated, all aspects of this movie work. The voice acting was phenomenal, especially Elizabeth Banks as the lead female, Liam Neeson as Good Cop/Bad Cop, and Will Arnett as Batman (he does a better Batman than Christian Bale—seriously). The musical score was on-point, the humor and action run plentiful, and there's plenty of heart and soul that will tug the heartstrings. Just wait until you arrive at the final act. Unlike practically every movie nowadays, you won't see it coming.It might be hard to believe that a movie with serious marketing and product placement implications becomes the best around since this past summer with Before Midnight. It might be even harder to believe that Warner Brothers has managed to surpass the usual suspects of Pixar (notice all the movies I've referenced in the review) and Dreamworks at their very own game. Nonetheless, this shocker of a gem is the perfect family cinematic package. From top to bottom The Lego Movie delivers. If this isn't one of the best films of 2014, then we are in for a spectacular year of cinema because this movie is seriously a work of kinetic brilliance.Recommend to the highest degree, no matter who you are or how old you are.",10,2,7,11 February 2014
X-Men: Days of Future Past," Suffering from superior competition, Days of Future Past entertains, but doesn't push franchise forward like X2
","X-Men Days of Future Past should go down as the blockbuster film that had arguably the most daunting task you'll see from a Summer flick: successfully combining a rebooted franchise with the franchise it had just replaced. Luckily for all of us there's a good old-fashioned time travel story to connect the two without too many continuity disruptions. Bringing back the man that delivered the best of the X-Men films up to this point, 20th Century Fox went all out to ensure that they can still hang on to the Marvel franchise.Based off of the highly-successful comic book series, Days of Future Past revolves around Wolverine (And not Kitty) heading back to the past to prevent a murder from occurring and creating the fallout that would lead to the dystopian-like present that involves all the mutants hiding for their lives. Hugh Jackman as Wolverine, the only constant that connects the two series of X-Men films, is the only hope to unite Professor X and Magneto in the 70s to prevent the creation of the ultra-powerful Sentinels. The emotional fallout from the events of First Class is overwhelmingly present so this movie feels a lot like a sequel and less as a mere connecting bridge between the X-Men films. Newcomers to the X-Men brand would probably be lost.The time-traveling quirks and limitations that made Back to the Future a masterpiece are not present here; the focus is entirely on the characters and the task they have at hand. X-Men fans shouldn't be too upset because they get to see a heavy slew of the mutants including Quicksilver, Colossus, Storm, among others. Too bad most of the X-Men are condensed to cameo-like appearances.And yea.....still no Gambit.....Whatever the film lacks in humor and action, it makes up for it with the heavy set of drama, bouts with forgiveness vs. justice, and the genuine care you will have towards our heroes. But like I said, the action is rather lacking and after nearly 15 years of X-Men being on the screen the battling becomes well repetitive. Which is a shame because Bryan Singer can craft good action sequences, especially when Quicksilver was involved. The Quicksilver appearance further proves the dulling of the fighting in X-Men when we see Magneto once again picking up something heavy with his mind and see Wolverine once again slash his way through opponents. After seeing the creative battles occurring on the Disney side, it gets hard to be blown away by anything here.There is plenty of heart and good performances, but you can't help but feel slightly underwhelmed at the X-Men as this is the seventh film featuring at least one of the mutants since 2000. Back then the X-Men was the peak of joyful comic book mayhem as we saw lots of interesting characters work together and showcase their abilities. But after the likes of The Incredibles, The Dark Knight, The Avengers, and even the recent Captain America, the competition has caught up. It is time to expand the scope, and push the franchise farther ahead with more risks, more surprises, and more twists.X-Men Days of Future Past will be sure to delight modern-day X-Men fans while slightly upsetting the hardcore crowd, but it doesn't quite top the quality batch of comic book movies we have seen within the past 5 years. Here's to hoping Apocalypse can shake things up a bit now that the transition between X-Men series is complete.",7,3,4,4 July 2014
Captain America: Civil War," The Hulk of the MCU, Civil War is a relentless powerhouse that entertains once the wheels start turning
","The cinematic equivalent to tossing dozens of awesome comic books in a blender with a heavy budget and pouring it out into celluloid, Civil War is not only a superb sequel and improvement to the Avengers films, but just might actually become the best MCU flick yet. And yes, the movie is extremely bloated. Yes, the movie becomes a bit of a downer especially after funnier offerings like Ant-Man and Guardians of the Galaxy. But once the wheels start turning and the conflict shifts into the second act you will be enthusiastically entertained up until the final scene.Civil War is honestly Avengers 2.5, but the half is only in terms of chronological order. In the third Captain America installment, the events from past Marvel offerings has the world afraid of the superheroes, and over a hundred nations want to be able to monitor and control where the Avengers goes and what they should do after an espionage mission gone wrong. This creates a rift between all the heroes, especially with Winter Soldier being a fugitive and another threat lurking within; and differing opinions on how to handle the situation. Civil War's biggest strength is the sheer amount of characters; as they bring back all the Avengers, and then threw in some new additions.Black Panther was flawless in performance, visuals, and execution. Second-billing favorites like Ant-Man, Falcon, Black Widow (who deserves her own movie) and Hawkeye make an appearance and also greatly deliver. Lastly, Spider-Man undoubtedly steals the show and he barely makes an appearance here. After 14 years of cinematic Spider-Man appearances, Marvel truly gets it right this time. Unlike what happened with Age of Ultron (entertaining yet forgettable), you will be excited for future features based off the new characters you meet within the 150 minute timeframe----especially Spider-Man. Sadly not all the Marvel personas get enough screen time, but it's part of the sacrifices made when there is such a long guest list to the motion picture party.The chemistry within the MCU is off the charts, and Civil War raises the bar even higher. What DC films are missing is this key element; mostly because we barely see any character development and consistent cast from sequel to sequel. The interactions between each of the heroes is what really allows this movie to go to the top tier of comic book mayhem, as even Bucky has his moments when involved with the others, especially (surprisingly) Falcon. The complicated relationship between Iron Man and Captain America is front and center, and both deliver spectacular performances as two guilt-ridden heroes desperately trying to avoid conflict even though all signs point to a clash.Helping Civil War maintain its bite is a strong (and rather gloomy) script and flawless direction from the Russo Brothers, who have impressed mightily since their debut with The Winter Soldier. The film honestly has it all: deep themes, lots of loss, plenty of surprises, tons of drama, tons of action, controversial decisions, and a good amount of humor to mix it all together---even though we really could have used more jokes in the first act. The action scenes range from clever to intense to downright entertaining. The Airport Battle will become a part of Marvel movie history, I promise you. The scene will be embedded in your memory if you are a fan of the comics. Then there's the incredible Bucharest Chase that's the best chase since Raid 2. At the same time, the final fight will break your heart.Painstaking amount of effort is given to not only making these characters come to life, but also making them likable and relatable. Marvel does a fantastic job picking the right staff behind the scenes, and does even better picking the actors and actresses to represent the MCU. Combine that with a proper budget and an extremely tight structure that connects all the films together and always leaves room for the upcoming sequels and you have a systematic series of films that resonates with the worldwide audience. Captain America: Civil War is now the peak result of this formula, as this is the first mega Marvel film since the original Avengers to appear to not pull any punches and maximize the content with the pieces allotted.As a comic book fan, there's no way you can walk out disappointed. And as a summer blockbuster fan, you will also have a lot of fun while simultaneously think about the events that occurred long after the final punch is thrown. Civil War is absolutely fantastic, and among the best comic book movies of all-time. DC, you need to watch this and take notes.",9,7,13,9 May 2016
Spirited Away," Not exactly easy to be 'Spirited Away' by this film when it takes so long and has too many slow moments in between
","Spirited Away is best-known for being the film that out of nowhere steals the Academy Award for best animated film from Lilo and Stitch and Ice Age, two very successful animated flicks that had come out at the same year. When I mean stole it, I do in fact mean stole it. Spirited Away is the kind of film that really points out what is wrong with animation today: not that much of a story, very inconsistent animation, lack of closure, and just too many slow moments. Clocking in at over two hours long, this is one of the longer animated movies to come out in recent years, and despite the few humorous moments, it isn't that great overall. Making an astonishing 200 million dollars overseas, it established Hayao Miyazaki as the 'Walt Disney of Japan.'This movie revolves around a clumsy yet courageous little girl named Chihiro who loses her parents because they ate food that belonged to spirits. As a result of this, she goes through a series of trials and adventures to get back to the regular world, or else be doomed to forever work in a bathhouse for spirits. Along the way, she meets up with Haku, a boy determined to take her back into the real world. Throughout the film, she meets an astonishingly large cast of characters, ranging from a greedy old lady that runs the bathhouse to some cute little spider-like critters. Along the way some of these critters help, some try to kill her, and others carry awful curses that plague their soul and also threatens to ruin the bathhouse.Miyazaki weaves an interestingly bizarre story, yet he stretches it way too long resulting in many dull and many, many slow moments. There are some scenes that way too prolonged and others that some may find utterly pointless. On the technical side though, there is a mixed bag. Unlike most translated animated films, this one stands out with very good voice work, and that is partly thanks to John Lasseter, otherwise known as one of the leading men of Pixar and director of the Toy Story movies.The animation on the other hand, is quite inconsistent. In several points of the film, there is an ugly mix of realistic animation with cartoony animation with an anime-style background. It doesn't mesh too well, seeing a realistically-drawn little girl with two goofy-looking animals and a very detailed old woman all together, sharing the spotlight for a minute or two. The mix of computer animation and regular animation doesn't work either. If you are going to work on a film, make it consistent, or at least make it look consistent. Beauty and the Beast contains some computer animation, but it is almost impossible to notice because it is done so well (The Beast dancing with Belle has the most computer animation in the film).As the climax rapidly approaches, it is hard to even find the mood. While on one hand there is suffering, in the corner of the screen there is some funny animation involving a hamster and a small bird trying so hard to keep up with the main character, Chihiro. It is hard to feel sorry and be saddened by the depressing cries of Chihiro, when we see the hamster trying to knit but to no avail. I found myself laughing during scenes in which there was supposed to be a gloomy mood, which is both frustrating and also embarrassing since I was watching it with some other people.Bottom Line: Best animated film of 2001? I don't think so, that title belongs to Ice Age. While it is an interesting and at times intriguing story, it is ruined by the conflicting animation, the amount of time it takes to tell the tale, and the failure to bring any drama when it is supposed to because of what is going on. The ending also arrives rather unexpectedly and comes up a bit short. While it sometimes looks pretty and sometimes is fun to watch, overall it is still lacking. At least it finally breaks the trend of Asian-made movies with bad dubbing by proving some excellent English-speaking voice talent. Spirited Away: won't blow you away, it will not totally frustrate you, but will not convince you to watch it again.",8,6,22,1 May 2006
Tropic Thunder," There is a comeback role in this movie, and he ain't in the posters either
","A critic's life is fairly simple, honestly it is. You complain about something that everyone else likes, support your opinion with more opinions, be the louder individual, boast the fact that you have seen more movies, then call it a day. Repeat process for all eternity. Hollywood needs to be ridiculed right about now with all that is going on in terms of its business, politics, beliefs, and decisions, and this movie pushes all the right buttons, becoming a movie for the critics described in the first epic sentence. Nobody in Hollywood is safe as movies, celebrities, decisions, and all aspects of Hollywood are dissed, spoofed, and is the subject of all the smaller inside jokes that movie critics would understand while the general public would pass off as mere dialogue. Meshing in the smart-aleck anti-Hollywood humor is enough action, visual gags, and one-liners to entertain the wider audience. Tropic Thunder is hilarious, and the more you've seen from Hollywood, the funnier it shall be. This movie exposes nearly all the silly shenanigans of Hollywood.The story in the movie is its biggest downfall whiles the entire cast, spillage of cameos, and visual jokes more than make up for the pratfall of a tale that is delivered. While some roles were not written well, the actor portraying him saves it from being a total meltdown. Whatever directing miscues by Stiller become apparent, the cast is right there with the next witty one-liner. It is a wild ride from start to finish.A group of actors, the action star trying to regain fame (Ben Stiller), the Oscar hog (Robert Downey Jr. in an Oscar-worthy role), the prankster trying to break out of typecasting (Jack Black, underused), the rapper-turned-actor (Brandon T. Jackson) and the film buff (Jay Baruchel), are sent to a secluded part of Vietnam so they can save the filming of a true story. However, in a series of freak events, they are forced to become the soldiers they are becoming in the flick. The five of them have to team up to survive the onslaught of enemies, despite their differences in personalityand acting. Yes, the movie sounds a little bit like Three Amigos, except its grittier, nastier, more violent, and has more commentary undertones.As previously stated, the acting is definitely what runs this movie. The main five characters (among others) throws so many lines at you, you won't be able to catch every single awesome quote ('It was a long flight' was missed by all). Robert Downey Jr. deserves at least an Oscar nod for his performance, he steals the show at almost any moment in which he speaks. Everyone else does a grand job (with Jack Black even doing decent despite having little material) but Downey Jr. and a certain cameo propel this movie from decent to surprisingly good. This is definitely the comeback movie for an actor, but its not one you'd expect.Wall-E was a tough pill to swallow as it was slow, yet mystifying. Tropic Thunder on the other hand hurls so many little pills at you; you might not be able to take them all. The pacing was fast, at times way too fast; and then sometimes the movie slows down to almost a halt. Ben Stiller has the right idea, but a better director could have definitely improved the movie. This is a better effort than The Cable Guy, but Stiller needs a little more work. The pyrotechnics enhances the warfare aspects of the movie, and some of the make-up and special effects added to the absurd over-the-top humor that Ben Stiller is known to possess.It may require a second viewing to catch all the jokes because there are layers upon layers of jokes patched throughout. Hollywood is insulted, so are war movies, so are many celebrities. Sometimes a scene is so entertaining the major joke(s) of the entire moment flies over your head (Pay close attention to the final shoot-out). Don't expect this movie to win any Oscars, as the Academy Awards are even made fun of in Tropic Thunder. There is a little bit of something for everybody, and this is definitely one of the best Stiller flicks he's even been caught up in. Stiller possesses the Sandler syndrome, in which the best movies of Sandler involve him not hogging all the attention but sharing it with the cast. Stiller has his moments, but so does everyone else.Bottom Line: One of the funniest movies in a while has arrived here. With plenty of action, humor, and randomness possessed, Tropic Thunder is a high and mighty spoof with very little slowdown and very little unfunny scenes. Robert Downey Jr. yet again proves why he is one of the more underrated actors of the past couple of decades and Stiller proves that he can step out of his quick-buck comfortable humor and dip into something darker and much more vulgar. Expect silliness, expect cameos, expect left field humor, but also expect some smart jokes flung in there to throw you off. Sit back, relax, and enjoy the humorous carnage.",8,1,3,17 August 2008
Scott Pilgrim vs. the World," True Gamers, this film is for you.
","Excellent soundtrack? Check. Great attention to detail? Check. Excellent visual effects? Check. Plethora of funny moments and witty dialogue? Check. Zelda reference? Check, and check. Scott Pilgrim easily ranks as the greatest video game film of all-time. In a cinematic world full of video game movies that fail to capture the detail, pacing, and magic of gaming, we have Scott Pilgrim showing how its done. Superbly directed by Edgar Wright and followed by a great cast of actors and actresses, this film is perfect for the gaming culture, and the deeper you are embedded in the cult world of video games, the more you will enjoy this flick. Word of warning, if you aren't that much into the sub-culture of video games and all its glory, you may not see this film as epic as it truly is.Scott Pilgrim vs. the World is about a slacker bassist of an underground band (Michael Cera) bouncing around depression and attempted recovery after a tough break-up. While messing around with a high school girl (Ellen Wong), Scott discovers the woman of his dreams, the beautiful, mysterious, and hip Ramona (Mary Elizabeth Winstead). But she comes with baggage: a slew of evil exes that Scott must defeat. Based off of the successful underground comics of Bryan Lee O'Malley, Scott Pilgrim vs. the World is unlike anything you've ever read; and with the thanks of Edgar Wright (Shaun of the Dead, Hot Fuzz), unlike anything you've ever seen. It is tough condensing multiple volumes of a detail-frantic comic book into a movie, but Wright and Michael Bacall did a great job translating the energy, speed, and silliness of the comics into film.Michael Cera gets a bad reputation for being a one-trick pony, someone who does the same type of performance. This is both incorrect, and not really his fault. His scrawny, thin, deadpan look can only get him certain types of roles in Hollywood (he reminds me of the slew of Italian actors that are seen in nearly every mobster/mafia flick of the 90s and 2000s---good actors, but typecast because of the way they look). But if you look at Youth in Revolt and Nick and Norah, you'll see a different side of Cera. In this case, we see a more desperate, less charming, not-as-likable but more ass-kicking Cera taking the spotlight. Then let's not forget the great scene-stealing performances of Ellen Wong, Chris Evans, Aubrey Plaza, and especially Kieran Culkin.Visually, this movie reflects a video game better than any video game movie ever crafted. The 1960s Batman-like sound effect visuals are all over the place, the fights are exaggeratingly fast and epic, the hilarious subtle details are all over the place, the screen splits into multiple frames constantly, and even the slower sequences flow like cut-scenes of a game. Edgar Wright is perfect for the directing because of his kinetic-style of editing and direction (ex: Hot Fuzz). Perfect for those with ADD, the flick moves from one scene to the next with such quick pacing, entire days can pass through your eyes without you noticing. The battles themselves are so fast, only those with trained eyes (in the art of fast-paced gaming that is) can follow the insanity without giving up.Now, with the movie being made specifically for those that dwell their lives into the culture, it might be an intimidation for those that don't appreciate the art of video games and the slackerish laid-back society it creates. If you don't know much about video games and all they have given us over the years, you'll see this as loud, crass, immature, and pointless. But, for those that have experienced 8-bit Mario and Zelda, enjoyed their Street Fighter II (and allllll their spin-offs), fumbled through Battletoads and Streets of Rage, and know the satisfaction of leveling-up to the ultimate level, you'll get a kick out of this, guaranteed. Just like Fight Club and its counter-culture anarchist ways, and Seinfeld and its New York City post-modern ideals, the more Scott Pilgrim represents you, the more you'll understand and love it.Of course, with the fast-paced style of the movie and the calmer character-developing moments of the comic book, there is bound to hit a contradictory snag. Scott Pilgrim works best when it's fast-paced and with multiple witty jokes waiting right around the corner. So, whenever the movie has a small slowdown to give the characters time to grow and reflect, it really, really feels slow. And while it doesn't destroy the movie, it does slow down the third act, even with an epic final battle and light-hearted ending. After two strong acts, the third act had a tough time catching up. Wright's best is usually saved for last, with Hot Fuzz's final shootout being an excellent example. Luckily though, it isn't too much of a distraction thanks to the wonderful cast and the strong visuals that remain fun to watch throughout the rather-long running-time (for a video game movie that is).Bottom Line: Scott Pilgrim vs. the World is a perfect movie for gamers, and a perfect movie for those that appreciate the culture, diversity, insanity, and randomness of video games. The cast was great, the editing was flawless, and the directing was grand. While the third act left me desiring more and failed to live up to the strong first two acts, it remains a movie I strongly recommend if you own any type of old-school gaming system. Just like the comic book, Scott Pilgrim is epic, hilarious, fun to watch, and an absolute delight. Yet as previously stated, if you are not trained in the world of gaming, then this flick will unnerve and perhaps even scare you. Visually stimulating, insane, and out of control, Scott Pilgrim represents gaming on the big-screen like nothing I've ever seen before.",9,11,32,13 August 2010
Enchanted," Offering hope to the hopeless
","'Sire, do you like yourself?' 'What's not to like?' It is the simplest exchange of dialogue in the movie. But underneath it, whether the director intended it or not, lies layers of meaning. Nethaniel, suddenly seeing things in the light of the real world, asks this question to Prince Charming, whom is looking for Giselle and still stuck in the magical-happy-go-lucky state of mind. Prince Charming is the representation of the old-school Disney, the very simple, clean, wholesome, lovable Disney that every single child grows up with. In the old-school days, dreams come true, the heroes and villains are defined, and beauty runs deep within the main heroine.Nethaniel is new-school Disney, unsure of itself, lacking any posture or ability to stand up and become known. Enchanted is quite possibly the greatest meshing of old-school with new-school, and while Disney self-mocks itself, it also statuses itself as the last main white hope in the dreams of children and adults. In a world full of cynicism, disappointment, and uncertainty over the actions and motives of other people, we all need a little bit of pixie dust to continue life. The question is can an old-school princess survive in a new-school world? Or would the new-school world consume the hopes and mannerisms of our princess? Enchanted stands as one of Disney's best family movies outside the Pixar realm this decade, and ultimately is an amazing celebration of the Disney image and reputation that it has sustained (in roller coaster fashion) for nearly a century.Enchanted is about a princess (Amy Adams) whom is flung into a world where 'dreams don't come true' according to our main villain Narissa (Susan Surandon). The reason for this is so that Narissa can remain at the throne and Giselle and Prince Charming don't marry. Giselle (in real-life form) winds up in New York City, where she runs into a pessimistic divorce lawyer (Patrick Dempsey) and his curious daughter. While waiting for Prince Charming to arrive to New York to save her, Giselle learns that her new setting is full of people that do not have hope in life and do not believe in a happy destiny. What's worse is that Prince Charming isn't the only one that makes his way to New York from the magical land.The script, written way back in 1997, went through a major series of changes before the final product was unleashed. And my what a script it is. Full of Disney references that could open up an amazing drinking game and full of bubbly fun, the story and dialogue remain crisp, clean, and despite predictable, contains plenty of unpredictable curves. However, the script doesn't make the film: Amy Adams does. Her performance is one of the few in film history that should quality for an Academy Award win, but won't get the nomination because of the content. It's definitely hard to praise the performance of a Disney princess, but Adams does spectacular as Giselle singing and acting-wise; infusing a jolt of energy and spirit rarely ever seen by anybody out there. Beneath her beauty is a bubbly personality that's impossible not to like. Everyone else did a grand job, including James Marsden and Timothy Spall as Prince Charming and Nethaniel respectably.Enchanted's charm comes from its celebration and references to past Disney princesses, and its message about finding hope in a lost world. Just like in the movie, we as a generation of people exposed to the negativity of the world on a minutely basis lose all sorts of hopes in all aspects of life. The Flapper era and the Baby Boomer saga are two eras that just might not be duplicated for a very long time; the care-free, happy-go-lucky, positive time period in which all is well with the world. Walt Disney Studios used to be able to bank on this sort of happy time period. After all, Cinderella, Lady and the Tramp, Peter Pan, and Sleeping Beauty all came out in the 50s alone. Disneyland came out in 1955. That time has passed, this sort of eventual happiness nowadays passes off as clichéd. Even Enchanted itself was tough to watch at first because films nowadays just doesn't have that happy feeling throughout all 90-plus minutes. Even modern-day Disney flicks have a bit more gloom than before: see Lion King, Hunchback of Notre Dame, Pocahantas, Aladdin, and dear goodness Fox and the Hound.The film's greatest strength is more than its humor, charming characters, and ridiculously happy ending; it's the message of hope and finding sunshine in a cloudy day that's screaming out to you within the first, second, and even final acts. Old-school Disney values are flung into New York City and the payoff is grand. Then there's the adorable musical numbers and nice choreography. You just want to hug the movie for being so cute. Even a bitter cynic like me couldn't help but smile throughout the entire thing, no matter how ridiculous it might be.Bottom Line: Disney's old-school allure can be found here, as the celebration of works past and present are sprinkled throughout a creative story full of easter eggs and adorable performances. Amy Adams runs this optimistic show as the film opens up a can of happiness to anyone that sees it; no matter how bitter you claim yourself to be. The film isn't absolute perfection, but easily one of the best live-action Disney works this entire decade. Despite the childish outer look, you must see it for the deeper messages of hope and love. Highly recommend, and its great fun for the entire family. Kudos to Disney for heading in the right direction after years of questionable decisions.'Everybody has problems. Everybody has bad times. Do we sacrifice all the good times because of them?' Not in Disney's watch.",8,1,1,4 April 2009
Inside Out," Inventive, Engaging, and Funny, Inside Out has the Peak-Pixar Flavor We Haven't Seen in Years
","20 years in the film business, Pixar has given us masterpiece after masterpiece even if its best days are probably behind them. They know how to toy with your emotions, add depth to their characters, and best of all know how to deliver very unique stories in very unique perspectives. Director Pete Doctor's previous movie Up is a grandiose example of being an excellent film despite being far off the norm. Inside Out is no exception as it tackles a very complicated yet creative concept of exploring the emotions of a person while giving personalities to emotions---which is no easy task.Inside Out being made into a feasible family movie is quite the accomplishment. Even if the deeper emotional moments and better jokes will be lost on the children, this film has something for everybody to see, from the visuals to the creative stylings of the human mind. Combine that with the perfect (Its honestly flawless) voice cast and a well-rounded script, you have Pixar's best since Toy Story 3.Joy (The perfect Amy Poehler) leads the cast as she attempts to dominate the mind of an 11-year-old and keep the other emotions (Anger, Disgust, Fear, and especially Sadness) in check---especially once the family relocates across the entire country. The conflict arises once Joy becomes unable to run Riley's emotions, leading to a lot of problems inside the mind and outside. Although Pixar runs in the Disney family and you secretly know how it will all pan out, the adventure and discoveries leading up to the inevitable conclusion is what keeps you engaged. There will be the classic Pixar mix of laughter, tears, and surprises throughout the quest to save Riley.Establishing the universe is essential in movies like these, where environments carry its distinctive logic, its distinctive gravity. Inside Out starts out slow so it can mesh out the characters and give us a good idea as to how to approach the world of the mind. By the time you reach the dramatic conclusion, you would have witnessed Riley's imaginative world, her abstract world, her dream machine, as well as her biggest fears. The journey is far from predictable, as Inside Out explores a concept rarely executed (save for a 90s cartoon and a hilarious Spongebob bit).Pixar has had a rough run lately, with delays and disappointing movies mixing together this decade. Inside Out is a step in the right direction thanks to a great script, delightful originality, and the great mix of great animation, laughs and heartfelt moments that we last experienced in the epic Pixar run of 2007-2010 (Ratatouille, Up, Wall-E, Toy Story 3, etc.). It might be slower or more bizarre then what you are used to seeing in animation and blockbuster season, but this film is a fresh visual treat from start to finish.",9,21,55,3 July 2015
Quantum of Solace," Bourne. Jason Bourne.
","Bond. James Bond.Not in this movie.Shaken, not stirred.Also not in this movie.What kind of Bond movie lacks those two quotes? A Bond movie that is trying so hard to deviate itself from previous Bonds, that it nearly loses its identity. Quantum of Solace is an action-packed thriller that slows down in the third act, and to make it worse we don't have the sophistication or charisma of James Bond to hold us over before the climax. We don't even have the amazing Bond girl that oozes sexuality and chemistry with our main star. Argue all you want about the plot line, references to previous Bonds, and so-called direction the franchise is transitioning to; this isn't a James Bond movie and even as an action flick it's not one to totally scream about either. The original idea was to revitalize the series and give it a fresh new start; but we wind up seeing a film that closely resembles that of the Bourne franchise.Becoming technically the first true Bond sequel, Quantum is about Bond (Daniel Craig) trying to stop an environmentalist from taking over natural resources while at the same time secretly seek vengeance for the death of his love in Casino Royale. In the meantime, 'M' (Judi Dench) is still having her issues with Bond as he continues to defy the rules and continues causing more problems than solving them. The adventure takes our hero through parts of Spain, Haiti, Italy, Austria, among other locations. With a script fleshed out by Academy Award winner Paul Haggis among other writers, they waste no time in engaging the audience in action scene after action scene. By the end of the first act, we would have experienced two fights, one shootout, and two chases. The first act isn't the problem though; it's the rest of the movie.The first act looks a lot like Bourne Ultimatum; shaky-cam nice and present, insane editing, crazy amounts of close-up shots, and raw, relentless, intense action. The action itself is impressive, especially with the on-foot chase that nearly topples that of Casino Royale. The stunt team of Ultimatum makes an appearance here, but their work probably isn't going to win them Oscars like the 2007 blockbuster. Daniel Craig continues proving that he's the best Bond in terms of physical ability and fight skills, as he can deliver brutal hit after brutal hit without cracking a smirk. His Bond continues to resemble that of the stories and Timothy Dalton; cold, calculating, and without much of a sense of humor. But Craig's Bond still lacks the sophistication and suave that previous counterparts contained, especially Connery and Moore. The rest of the cast did decent job acting, with special mention to Judi Dench as she remains the only carryover from the Brosnan days.The second and third acts is where the problems amount. The Bond girls in the movie? They barely qualify. The main villain? Not as entertaining as the average Bond villain. Supporting cast? We don't have that many colorful characters in this grim flick. Crazy plot line? Not quite crazy, a bit down-to-earth actually. So what are we depending on for entertainment as the final climatic battle sets up? James Bond? Not this time, because he's still bitter, still bickering, doesn't talk much, isn't smooth, remains cold as ice, and just resembles more the troubled Jason Bourne than a James Bond. There are way too many similarities to the Bourne franchises in terms of themes and content.Then the final action scene actually underwhelms and comes by too fast, especially when the previous action sequences were so well-staged. Mark Forster also has this knack of telling more than showing; as we have many instances in which events happen, but you don't see them happen, you are told they happened. For the sake of spoilers, I shall not reveal them, but the running time of this movie is much shorter simply because dialogue replaces action in a few instances. Even the ending of Quantum resembles that of a Bourne movie (Supremacy in this case), in which Bond faces a demon of his past in order to be able to move on with his life.Bottom Line: The James Bond franchise was (yes, was) escapist cinema, pure and simple. Emotion and realism was replaced with outlandish villains, lush environments, hot babes with clever names, cool gadgets, and a main character that defines dangerous sophistication. For decades (with minimal exceptions) it has been this way, and the formula worked for the most part. Quantum of Solace contains absolutely none of this, as they morphed the franchise into a similar series of intense spy movies with cold main characters seeking closure and vengeance because of the past. This isn't Bond, and topping Bourne isn't going to happen unless you can draw out elements from the classics. Yes, Die Another Day was a signal that we needed a change, but is this really what's best for Bond? Turning him from a lovable hero into a torn individual that could kill? Even the running time is condensing to match the mainstream; and because of this the movie suffers even more. There was amazing scenery, but we saw little of it because Bond was running amok. The villain was lightly interesting, but could have been more if he had actually gotten more screen time. There's plenty of complaining here, but this is a cinema fan seeing another beloved franchise growing serious and moody and forgetting the reason we came to see their films in the first place: to escape real life. Just like recent Batmans, they had forgotten to include the fun. Casino Royale/Daniel Craig Bond fans however shouldn't be disappointed, but if you are waiting for a big change, it's not happening here. This movie isn't a ridiculous disaster, but could have been much more, and is spiraling Bond towards a path I personally don't like.",6,5,7,17 November 2008
No Country for Old Men," This is two movies in one: What to definitely do in film-making, and what NOT to do in film-making. Entertainment (then utter disappointment) at its finest
","No Country For Old Men is an amazing thriller full of tension, suspense, well-directed moments, fantastic imagery, wonderful dialogue, superb acting, and a nice plot to tie it in together. Then the movie decides to end. This film takes one of the biggest quality downfalls I have ever seen in my life, and this is by no means exaggeration. How does a movie do so well for so long and then deliver such utter garbage when we the viewer least needed it? How on earth does a movie full of tension for so long suck out the entertainment and desire to continue watching in a mere matter of moments? The questions continue to linger through my head as I write this; as the Best Picture Oscar winner disappointed me in ways I've never been disappointed before.The worst part is the hard-hitting potential that was chugging along the fantastic story four-fifths of the way. The Coen Brothers looked like they ran out of ideas or just had no clue how to stop rolling the cameras and finish the gosh-darn story. In a film that liked showing more than telling throughout the first 90 minutes, it was certainly a surprise when the rest of the film was pretty much just narrated to us, as if we were a bunch of idiots. Main characters in the end are whether watered-down, having a serious case of the talkies, or just flat-out disappeared. This is easily one of the weakest films to actually receive a Best Picture nod. Well, at least it ain't Crash but it's certainly a movie that could have been one of the best in decades.In this film, we follow a hunter (Josh Brolin) becoming hunted down by Mexican criminals, lawmen (Woody Harrelson, Tommy Lee Jones), and a psychotic killer (Javier Bardem) because of a great deal of money he discovered at a crime scene. This is pretty much a tense, violent cat-and-mouse game that has a good deal of followers and supporting players. No Country For Old Men is based off a novel with the same name by Cormac McCarthy; and translates well to the screen with very few changes and subtractions. The Coen Brothers can weave a good script, and their previous work is definite proof of this (Fargo, come on now). The dialogue of the killer Anton was downright scary, and the philosophical views of the cops involved also spark a bit of interest. However, when staying close to the original material, one tends to forget that original material does have its flaws as well. Unfortunately, the Coen Brothers were also very accurate with the weak portions in the book.The ensemble cast in the film is absolutely wonderful, from the usually awesome Tommy Lee Jones to the decent Josh Brolin to the incredibly scary Javier Bardem. The film has a heavy dosage of cruel realism and the acting is one of the main reasons why this film worked so well for so long. Bardem portrays one of the best movie villains in ages, even surpassing that of Heath Ledger's Joker and Hugo Weaving's Agent Smith. His performance overpowers that of everyone else's by leagues.Let's discuss what made this film so magnificent for the first two acts. First off, the directing was phenomenal as there were many series of long shots that built up the tension to a point in which you couldn't breathe. Then there's the incredible cinematography that could craft beauty out of dull settings. Last but not least was the quick pacing that kept the story flowing well and maintaining the interest of the viewer involved. While the portrayals of the characters could have used some major work writing-wise (the origins of almost all the main characters were pretty much non-existent) they kept the movie interesting. The lack of a soundtrack allowed for us to truly appreciate the incredible usage of sound involved (even a wrapper made a distinctively realistic noise when placed on a table).Ending. What ending? The film literally wraps up in the middle of a scene. The film literally has no major climax, doesn't wrap up any loose ends, goes on a philosophical tangent, creates even more questions (which is never good if you are trying to END the movie) than answers. Everything going for this powerhouse flick was thrown away towards the end and instead we get this muddled, disgusting affair of dialogue. First 100 or so minutes: a lot of bark and bite. The last 20 minutes: weak, weak, weak barking and not a single bite. It was as if we were seeing two totally different movies, and neither one of them technically ended. It was as if the last pages of a good book were replaced with unsatisfying and useless Chicken Soup for the Soul quotations. The movie could have ended worse only if it were done in a gigantic musical interlude with hyper fruits flying out of cannons. Other than that random suggestion, you have to dig pretty hard to find the last time a good movie that ended in such a sour note.Bottom Line: beautiful gem in the beginning, utter trash and garbage by the end of it all. What hurts the most is that with so much potential, the Coen Brothers ripped apart what made the movie work and spiraled it towards heavy disappointment level. The sour taste of the ending still lingers in my mouth as I write this. Best Picture? Sorry, but the entire movie has to deserve it, not just most of it. It's a total shame because there was such good usage of sound, such good cinematography, and grand acting. No Country For Old Men was like a five-star meal with a two-star topping. Let me end the review just like the mov-",6,2,4,4 December 2008
District 9," What are we watching again!?!?
","So, name a movie that is a mix of mockumentary, thriller, action, sci-fi, and political commentary? Can't come up with one? Well, in case a random question like this pops up in Jeopardy, the answer is District 9. Resembling nothing that was shown in the trailer, District 9 is a crazy-different way to look at cinema and the genre of science fiction. The movie itself is split into two major parts: starting off as a subtle hilarious mockumentary, but then quickly shifts in tone when the stakes are higher and danger is rounding the corner. This unique approach to telling the story about aliens stranded in Earth being shunned from human society will whether totally impress you or bore you to death, its very hit-and-miss. Even if the beginning isn't your cup of tea, stick around, because the true insanity starts once the events behind the camera start unfolding.District 9 involves a man Wikus (Sharlto Copley), in charge of attempting to peacefully relocate the alien species currently inhabiting Earth. With the entire army behind him, he sets off to District 9 to warn the aliens to move without conflict, or problems will occur. In the midst of the relocating and checking for any illegal activities and supplies, he becomes exposed to their biotechnology, resulting in him becoming a fugitive and in grave danger of losing everything he had worked for. At the same time, some of the aliens may be making process towards ending their alienation (pun intended) with the Earth. Based off of a short film directed by the same man helming this visual roller coaster, District 9 is a major allegory to the issues happening in Africa and the Middle East. Yes, there is a political slant involved, but it never distracts from the original story.The script is quite clever, but it's the directing and visual style that absolutely stands out. The first half of the movie is in a documentary format full of interviews and backstory as to how the scenario (and now issue) has come at hand. In this same documentary format, we enter the District 9 world, and see the poor condition the aliens were living through. We also see the corruption, greed, and evilness that occupy the same area. The camera vibrates, moves, and breathes just like a documentary, and the footage of the aliens intertwining and interacting with humans looks downright realistic to the core. Special effects and special directing can be attributed to this incredible accomplishment.Acting also enhances the documentary feel, as a good portion of the dialogue in the beginning is improvised on the spot, giving it an even greater feel that these events can be unfolding thousands of miles away. Everyone reacts to the CGI aliens with accuracy and realism, almost as well as Jurassic Park (which remains the best film in terms of the actors interacting with the special effects). Unlike in most sci-fi flicks, there is a good bit of emotional sentimentality, especially that of Wikus and his wife.The second half is where the entire movie turns around and becomes something totally different. In a style akin to From Dusk Till' Dawn (which turned from suspense to full-out vampire horror), District 9 starts off as a politically-motivated mockumentary with humorous undertones to a heavy action thriller with science fiction touches left and right. This will whether enhance the movie for you or totally turn you off from it. The shift in style never really changes the tone and theme of the movie, so it was a seamless transition (unlike From Dusk Till' Dawn and Pineapple Express), and one that feeds the action-starved viewers sitting through the first half. We wondered where the R-rating came from, and it wasn't until the action began dominating that we didn't see it.Neill Blomkamp directed the documentary footage well, but truly showed his skills when the action increased, especially considering the low budget. The weapons were impressive, the shootouts were tightly-edited, and the film never drops in suspense and thrills until the very end of the film. With very little time to breathe, you see blood spill to the screen, you see bodies flying everywhere, and you see that with a limited budget, you can still deliver very impressive visuals. While the ending came up a bit fast considering all we went through, it was a crazy ride from start to finish, and one you cannot claim you've been through before.Bottom Line: District 9 is the cure for the common sci-fi. This film will become a major influence to studios everywhere, because it was a visually stunning film, and it comes with a budget of less than 35 million—which is less than a quarter of the budget of Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen. Blomkamp's first film was a success because of his ability to blend special effects and capture the emotions of the actors and actresses involved without going over-the-top. The first half gives the film a small sense of realism, and the second half gives the film a dosage of adrenaline that propels the movie through around half an hour of relentless action. As long as you don't mind the total shift in genre and style, then you are in for an exhilarating two hours.",8,3,5,12 January 2010
Batman Begins," Overrated, but good
","Batman is a much tormented franchise in the movie business. Starting with the campy 60s film that was totally geared towards kids to the fun and hopelessly inaccurate Batman Forever to the disgusting bomb Batman and Robin, our Caped Crusader has yet to defeat his biggest villain, his interpreters. Like almost all comic book films, Batman constantly is shown at the big screen under the interpretation of the director of the movie. Tim Burton had a dark, gloomy, Gothic view of Batman and the citizens of Gotham City. This is why Batman was a remarkable film, and the reason kids left the theaters crying after seeing Batman Returns. Joel Schumacher had a more colorful look at Gotham City, which is why Batman Forever and Batman and Robin were totally neglected and criticized, among other reasons. By the time Batman and Robin had come out, Batman was no more than an old-looking guy with a whiny partner wearing a batsuit that apparently contained nipples, and was fighting against an Austrian-sounding Mr. Freeze, and an appallingly watered-down Bane. Batman fans were sobbing at the end of the film.Years upon years later, Batman gets another chance. Seeing that most of his fellow super hero buddies like Spider-Man and Wolverine and even the Hulk making some good moolah for Marvel and DC and everyone else involved, another man gets the script of the next Batman movie. This time, they are going to attempt to wipe out the existence of the previous Batman films. Christopher Nolan gets to be on the director's chair. Already a major hit with indie fans, Nolan and Christian Bale used the popular comic book Batman: Year One to bring out the storyline and the origins of Bruce Wayne and why he is the way he is. This film opens to praise from virtually everybody, from Batman fans from regular moviegoers, and also from most critics as well. Batman Begins basically is the beginning of it all (duh!), how and why Bruce Wayne became Batman. While this is truly a wonderful experience for some avid comic book readers, others may wonder why it takes more than an hour to explain the anger behind Wayne, when the pop culture world already knows the reason he is so ticked off.In other words, the plot moves rather slowly throughout the first hour, with a few glimpses of witty dialogue here and there (decent one-liners by Christian Bale and Michael Caine). Batman Begins is the most accurate interpretation of the Batman movies, but after the translation, what else is there? Gotham City looks like a regular metropolis; as a matter of fact the entire film has a very realistic look, which is most certainly not Batman-like. Burton may have screwed around with the story enough to perhaps garnish a couple of lawsuits, but he had the art direction down perfectly. Burton's Gotham City and even the Gotham City of Batman: The Animated Series looked much better. There is virtually no effort in terms of trying to bring out the gloomy tone and mood of Gotham City through its setting, Gotham City looked like any regular major city.Christian Bale plays a magnificent Bruce Wayne, but a rather bland Batman. Bale as Batman sounds like he is going through a horrific sore throat. In a weak attempt to make Batman sound scary, I was almost laughing when Batman in interrogating one of the gangsters. Michael Caine does a good job as the father-like figure butler, but I still do miss Michael Gough. Morgan Freeman is Morgan Freeman, it seems like he does a wonderful performance in any movie that he is in, and Batman Begins is no exception.The villains have absolutely nothing interesting about them, and when they have a moment to shine, it gets quickly taken away. Scarecrow, the best villain in the film, gets very, very little screen time. Cillian Murphy does a superb job as the creepy and quiet Scarecrow, but perhaps as an effort to not allow a villain to steal the spotlight, he can barely be seen in the film. On superhero films, there has to be a balance between the villains the heroes fighting them. In Batman Begins, there is no balance at all, the film is mostly about Batman and while yes that would make sense, do recall that most Batman baddies have a sort of connection with the twisted hero.Most filmmakers nowadays when they do not know how to create spectacular fight scenes, they chop up the film and also zoom in on the subjects when the action becomes heavy. The Bourne Supremacy suffers from this. From the first fight to the final showdown, Nolan approaches the people fighting way too close resulting into some confusion as to who is fighting who and who is on the ground. In other words, Nolan could have used some of the fight choreographers in the Transporter movies and the Matrix films and some better cameramen to create more visually-appealing fights. The only exception to the rule was the sword fight when Bruce Wayne was training. By the way, Danny Elfman could have improved this movie by adding his superb orchestrated magic that made Batman (1989) such a delight to hear as well as to watch.Bottom Line: The truest Batman film ever, but not the best. I still prefer the dark and magnificent 1989 film, and even in some cases, the action-packed and well-performed Batman Forever (Kilmer made a good Batman, and Jones and Carrey stole the entire spotlight). Like Sin City, it is a great adaptation, but after that there isn't much more. At least in the case of Sin City, there was a lot of effort in the visuals. But hey, it is better than Batman and Robin, but still lacks excitement. Where is the fun in this film? I'd say this movie is rather overrated. Good work Nolan, but your film is far from perfect.",8,2,4,25 October 2005
Wreck-It Ralph," Fresh Story full of Familiar Flavor, Wreck-It Ralph is nostalgically entertaining
","Wreck-it Ralph is Hollywood's latest foray in to the subculture world of gaming---a world that Hollywood essentially knows nothing about, with examples I refuse to mention so I don't have the sensation of throwing up. Except this time its Disney turning on the nostalgia while delivering a fresh story that involves a mixing of classic-style arcade games with the new-school arcade hits that we currently see. So what we have is a pure gamer movie, right?Not quite. It is not a gamer's movie, it is really an animated movie with many, many nods to the world of arcade and console gaming. There is a major difference. You don't have the pacing, style, mood, and tone of a video game here unlike the visually stimulating whirlwind of a trip we experienced in Scott Pilgrim vs. the World. Instead you have a movie with a major Disney touch and essentially becoming the modern-day version of Who Framed Roger Rabbit---a new cast of characters being joined by dozens of cameos from old-school favorites. Don't let this statement deter you, just let it allow you to hover your mind around the fact that the cameos you saw in the trailer was not a sample, it was a display of the entire menu. Luckily for this movie, the cast of characters featured are very likable, have their moments to shine, and do propel the movie forward when the plot (and amount of references) gets stuck in the mud. From the lovable baddie Wreck-It Ralph to the adorably filthy and sarcastic Vannelope (brilliantly executed by Sarah Silverman, an underrated comedic gem), you will feel for the characters much like when you immerse yourself in a gigantic video game. You will root for the two as they both fight for a place in gaming society, in a world that mistreats the outcasts, gaming villains, and anything too retro. In a sort of ironic twist, Disney and Nintendo (the current gaming leader) are very alike in mannerisms, and also very similar in how their audience reach prevents them from fulfilling their true potential. With Nintendo they aim to remain looking hardcore while attempting to reach out into the mainstream. With Wreck-It Ralph, it was a kids movie full of sight and verbal gags that will giggle the children and tweens while severely pushing heavy and subtle gaming references to the 80s, 90s, and gamers of today even. There is a Leroy Jenkins reference for crying out loud. Surely everyone gets their spoonful of fun, but it prevents the movie from truly pushing towards something edgy, something more. But what they do deliver, is a delightful movie that is chock full of nostalgia and originality. This awkward mix works for the company that saved the gaming industry, and works for the film that celebrates it.",7,6,8,2 November 2012
The Grand Budapest Hotel," An Adult Looney Tunes Cartoon that paces like a hyper flipbook, Grand Budapest Hotel is dazzling, unique, and pure absurd entertainment
","You know you've made your mark in the cinematic world when just a few visual images from a trailer reveals that you are behind the movie. Whether it's the rapid-fire editing of Tony Scott (or his successor, Edgar Wright), pulp house content of Robert Rodriguez (who just isn't the same anymore), or the long-sweeping shots of Steven Spielberg, if you can immediately figure out who made the movie with just an image or a scene alone, it's a very, very good sign.And now we have Wes Anderson and his whimsical, colorful, adult Dr. Seuss style of storytelling that has potentially reached its peak with the enduring, zany, and unpredictable Grand Budapest Hotel. This cinematic ball of energy looks like a Pollock painting if it ever got organized, runs like a Looney Tunes cartoon, and delivers an adult story in a most unique, childlike wondrous way. Similar to how Woody Allen's career took a second wind as he went overseas, Wes Anderson's movie-making trip to Europe elevates his skills and abilities as a director to brand new heights.The story is surprisingly dark, as it spans multiple World Wars and covers a mystery involving a woman that may or may not have been murdered. The plot however moves so swiftly, so quickly, and contains so many humorous twists and turns you don't have time to dwell on the grimness. It does help that we have an excellent cast playfully tagging along for the ride, including Ralph Fieness in an Oscar-worthy performance, William Dafoe, and Tony Revolori---while also giving points to Jude Law, F. Murray Abraham, Adrian Brody, and Jeff Goldblum for their small but memorable roles.Cast is important (Wes always has great casts, Hollywood should take notes), but this is Anderson's work first and foremost, and it's his writing and meticulous attention to detail that has allowed for him to emerge as one of the top directors in the game. Too bad that his light indie style doesn't exactly fit with the norm that usually gets Oscar attention (Similar to Spike Jonze). Don't let the lack of Oscar bait bum you though, the movie is dazzling eye candy with gorgeous shots and even more gorgeous cinematography that warrants multiple viewings to appreciate the backgrounds and foregrounds that blend with the cast and the story being told. The unconventionalism (not a word, I know) of Anderson separates him from not only Hollywood but from the Indie movement as well.Grand Budapest Hotel is a Wes film plain and simple: great plot, colorful cast of characters, detailed settings, bite-sized dark humor, quirky swirl of comedy and drama, and an energy that you just don't get in many works nowadays. Grand Budapest Hotel is a visual treat from start to finish, so if you can handle his unique flavor and brand, then there is no reason why you would skip this movie. Easily one of the best you'll see this year.",9,2,4,8 September 2014
The Transporter," The mindless action film that actually entertains
","Accept The Transporter for what it is and then the rest is just uphill from there. The Transporter is this European film that is exactly the kind of film that I had been looking for: it is no question a truly mindless action flick with a lot of action and also a ton of stunts, and very little plot to weave it in together. Who needs a plot anyway? Despite being a bomb at the United States box office, it gained enough popularity over a small cult following to garnish a sequel. And if there is a movie that deserves a sequel, it should be this one. Not enough people gave Jason Statham a chance years ago, and maybe this time the American public gets to see how good he really is.This fast-paced film is about a man who gets paid to move stuff around, and he never questions what it is and who it is going to, he is simply used as a transport. Retied mercenary, suddenly Frank Martin grows a heart when his next transfer is actually an Asian female woman. After breaking one of the rules (opening the package) disaster erupts, and now it is up to him to end all the chaos. Yes, the plot sounds a bit on the uncreative end, but guess what, there is only one reason to see this movie, and it is for the action.The Transporter has more action than most American films out today, and this movie happens to be only 92 minutes long. The movie opens with a massive chase sequence, and the movie ends with a massive chase/action sequence that despite it resembling Raiders of the Lost Ark, it still keeps you on the edge of your seat until the sequence is finished. In between the two big scenes are several more fights here and there that were well choreographed and almost perfectly executed. And unlike most other action movies like The Bourne Supremacy, the action isn't so in-your-face that you have no idea what is going on, the camera is far away enough from the subjects that it allows you to see everything that is happening, and also at times, slows down so you can catch your breath and be able to realize what had just happened. The acting is certainly not Oscar-caliber, but it gets the job done. Jason Statham has plenty of potential in becoming the next big action star, as long as the United States gives him a chance. Remember it took Jackie Chan over a decade before finally coming out with a movie that American audiences went to see, which was Rumble in the Bronx. Oh, before I forget, the soundtrack to the movie was awesome.Bottom Line: I use Jackie Chan as an example for one reason alone, because Jackie Chan and Jason Statham are both stars of two of among the most underrated and underapprieciated action films in a very long time. Just like Rumble in the Bronx, The Transporter has a weak plot, but is totally made up for with the insane amount of action and kung-fu that makes this film a perfect summer popcorn flick. I personally find this film very entertaining, and get over the fact that it received very little attention and give it a chance, I am sure you will like it. The Transporter: Finally, the mindless action flick that does not try too hard to have a decent plot.Score: 9/10",8,0,0,5 August 2005
City of God," Numbingly tragic yet gripping at the same time, City of God is an ugly tale beautifully displayed on screen
","Sometimes in order to portray a harsh reality, one must embed vicious images into the minds of others, no matter how gruesome they may be. City of God is a ghastly movie full of things you thought you'd never see in a movie. What's even worse is how it's based off a true story. Even more terrifying then that is how the children in the movie for the most part have experience in the slums that are being portrayed. With kids being as skillful in murder as the average human being, City of God is a totally different look into the country of Brazil, one that you'd never see on the Travel Channel. Compared favorably to crime movies like Goodfellas, the only difference is in this narrative; you have no other choice but to be a gangster in the streets.City of God follows the lives of two people that tread down different paths from the moment their childhood is introduced. On one hand, you have Rocket, a mild-mannered, quiet, kind individual mixed up in one of the more hostile environments portrayed on film. The other kid is Lil Ze', whose psychotic behaviors began as a child when he started tasting violence and enjoying it. One would rise up to try to escape the warzone, the other would thrive in it and become one of the leaders. As the movie progresses however, Lil' Ze begins losing control of his life, while Rocket slowly but surely has hope in leaving the area. The movie also drifts away from the main storyline multiple times to present smaller stories of other characters; some that fight, some that try to leave, and kids whose futures look bleak from the get go.On a film like this, shooting on location and using people that have witnessed it all was a clever and well-executed idea. City of God uses kids, teenagers, adults, and elderly folks that have accustomed to the violent ways of life and present all their previous experience to this film. Tons of improvisation and a lot of dangerous cinematography later, this is one of the most brutally realistic movies about the drug world you'll ever see. The movie never focuses on main characters either, like a joyride you'll be taken through three different time periods and through the lives of multiple individuals and even the history of certain locations.The frenzied storytelling is accompanied by frenzied editing; which meshes that of Goodfellas, Raging Bull, Pulp Fiction, Run, Lola, Run, and even The Matrix. While it isn't as tightened as the gems described in the previous sentence, it remains riveting and keeps you on the edge of your seat. The editing and directing is what runs the film, and with good results as well. Nobody is merely showing off their technical skills, the cuts distinguish the emotions of the scene, and just how frantic life is when bullets are ripping through the air. All sorts of cuts are strategically placed throughout the film; we get wipes, quick-cuts, cutaways; the works. You become a part of all that goes on, the camera-work and editing throws you right into the action.Brutal is the best way to describe this movie. Everyone has a gun, from the heroes to the villains to even the children. Nobody is safe, everyone is being double-crossed, everyone is being questioned and questioning the actions of others. Like the eyes of God, all are equal but unlike Him they are all equal for the killing, regardless of age or stature. The innocent are killed, and so are the guilty, and so are the children. In one very sad scene, a little child is forced to choose from two similarly-aged kids who to kill. It's anybody's game out there in the streets; and nobody is spared. The death count is alarmingly high and whenever you begin to sympathize with someone, they bite the dust, become a victim of the violence that erupts. This makes the movie just as sad, just as gripping, and just as memorable. The acting is great because, they all know what its like and can perfectly convey it on camera with little help.Bottom Line: City of God is an excellent mesh of editing, directing, cinematography, and re-creation of a bloody environment that few people know about. The story is sad and will tear your heart out, but will keep you watching as you root for a potential happy ending. What keeps you watching is the hope that there is light at the end of the tunnel, even when the characters are shrouded in uncertainty and darkness. There are few words that can describe just how good the story is; real-life events depict some of the best tales around, even if they can become very bleak in content. Like a kick in the chest, City of God unleashes an environment you'd never believe, simply because of how dreary and deadly the location is. Highly recommend, but be prepared for the grimness within.",10,0,2,9 April 2008
Cars," A feast to the eyes, good medicine for the heart, and a good flick for everyone, Pixar remains running without a disappointment yet
","The only problem with setting the bar so high is that then you are expected to always perform at that level. Pixar set the bar so high with some of its masterpieces that whenever they come out with an above-average animated film, its still 'disappointing' because it's compared to its other brilliant creations. The Incredibles suffers from this, and so does Cars. But, just like The Incredibles, Cars is a superb tour-de-force that should entertain the entire family. From the beginning fun-filled race to the great ending, Cars is a technical achievement, visually appealing, and also contains a great message, one that does not seem forced unlike other animated movies. As a matter of fact, this is perhaps the best animated movie since Finding Nemo three years ago.Cars focuses on Lightning McQueen, who is a fast-talking, cocky, arrogant, independent rookie whose first year in racing has proved to be a very successful one. Yet, during his drive to California in attempt to claim his first Piston Cup trophy, he becomes sidetracked and is stuck in a secluded town called Radiator Town full of friendly cars led by a quiet yet bitter car with a mysterious past. Throughout the movie, Lightning attempts to leave the town, but the citizens are not going to just let him go without a fight.Casting is amazing. Owen Wilson perfectly matches his character, Lightning McQueen, and Larry the Cable Guy actually provides some laughs as Mater. Paul Newman is excellent as the humble Doc Hudson, and the rest of the cast (Cheech Marin, Tony Shaloub, George Carlin, John Ratzenberger, Michael Keaton) did a great job as well. Pixar separates itself from most other movie companies because there is a lot of focus in storytelling, and the script was very good, and the dialogue has many humorous moments as there are one-liners sprinkled all-over the place. Watching the credits, one would see the amount of research put into the movie as well as dedication and effort, and that is something that really doesn't happen much with movies nowadays, especially those that come out in the summer.While it is not the funniest Pixar movie nor is it the one with the saddest moments, the blend of comedy, drama, and hint of racing action is spectacular. The pacing totally slows down as the setting changes, which is a rarity in itself. You sometimes forget that they are all cars as they showcase their happiness, sorrow, and pain through their dialogue, tone, and also their facial expressions like a human being. Some moments actually had the audience collectively saying 'awwww,' or collectively gasping, or collectively breaking out into laughter. If anyone complains about the pacing of the film, then they obviously missed the message. Cars shows that at times, its best to slow down and take life slowly, not constantly have to go out their to win the gold, to earn the money, to gain respect. If you complain about the pacing, then you are a victim of the fast-paced world we live in.Animation is utterly startling, so rich in detail, so rich in color. Everything visually is practically perfect, from the tire tracks in the background to the little scratches in the main character's car, to the thousands of spectator cars witnessing the race. It is hard to blink because missing a moment of Cars would be a punishment to the eyes. Showcasing emotion through facial expressions in automobiles is not easy, yet Pixar pulls it off like it was no problem at all. It is obvious years were put into this movie.Bottom Line: I can't put enough praise on this film to fit into this review. In a world of sequels, remakes, and disasters, it is nice to see that there is still some creativity out there and that there is still a company that can flesh out quality movie after quality movie. Cars has excellent casting, a great story, detailed animation, a superb ending, and a hefty dose of drama to blend in with the humor, Cars is a blast--much better than previous Dreamworks efforts, better than any Blue Sky movies, and even better than the latest Wallace and Gromit production. You would have to go back to 2003 to find a better animated film, when Finding Nemo surprisingly destroyed the summer competition for a very long time. Cars should add some nostalgia for the adults, and should also entertain the kids despite it being almost two hours in length. 10 years and still running well, good job Pixar. Cars: not the first good movie of the summer, but the first great movie of the summer.",7,6,10,9 June 2006
Gone Girl," The Hitchcock is Strong in This One
","Gone Girl starts off with in an unsettling fashion, even throwing the opening credits quicker than normal. This makes the audience a little uneasy as the story begins.And the audience will remain uneasy and struggling to catch up for the remainder of the film.Gone Girl is polarizing, intense, extremely jaded, and quite manipulating. David Fincher's fingerprints are all over the adaptation of the best-selling novel that alters the tone of the book to adjust better to the cinematic medium. From the direction to the spellbinding and haunting musical score, Gone Girl hits all the right notes, does an excellent job maintaining the tense mystery without becoming predictable, and leads an all-star cast (Even Tyler Perry was bearable) surrounded by talent in the art, cinematography, and production department.What starts off as a simple tale of a quiet mysterious husband (Ben Affleck) worried about the disappearance of his wife (Rosamund Pike in a pure Give Me My Oscar performance) turns into a darkly stylish thriller with twists, turns, unexpected surprises, intrigue, and slick commentary on American marriage and the American media's mannerisms surrounding the news and the people involved in it. Similar to Social Network, it presents an interesting character and sociological portrayal while mixing in an exhilarating story to propel the movie forward.Andthen we go in a very different direction for the final act.In a style similar to Hitchcock's also-polarizing Vertigo, Gone Girl consists of two parts: the mystery and the consequences of the mystery once the conclusion has been unveiled. This makes Gone Girl practically two different movies that might be equal in tone but splits into seemingly opposite roads. While the film is 150 minutes long, the climax of the original conflict actually arrives much much sooner than the norm—just like Vertigo. And just like Vertigo, it's slightly tough to appreciate the unveiling of the wild card when there is still so much poker left.The best way to describe Gone Girl without revealing any of the surprises and revelations is this: Gone Girl's first two acts are like a dark roller coaster you've never ridden before; full of turns and inversions that you will enjoy and consistently anticipate and request more of. The final act of Gone Girl is like a good roller coaster you've ridden before; where you can appreciate the thrills, appreciate the details, but at the same time make you wish you could be surprised more.And----like Vertigo----if the movie had played out the mystery and the conflict a bit longer then the payoff would have been much grander. The timing of the payoff is extremely important in movies like this, it can make a movie like Fight Club and The Usual Suspects, or it can totally shatter a movie like Lucky Number Slevin (Oh, you don't remember this one? Of course you don't). Not to say Gone Girl loses too much momentum once the movie takes a jarring shift, but that second roller coaster ends quite abruptly, leaving you with a satisfied feeling with a side of emptiness.But hey, there is a good chance that Fincher's intention was to never let you find your footing during the grim adventure. There is a good chance that Fincher had spent a good deal preparing a beautiful cinematic present without even considering topping it with a nice bow. Because at the end of the day, whatever timing and tonal shift issues the Gillian Flynn script presented, it was eradicated by the high value of the overall film. It is unique, it is breathtaking, and it will devour your thoughts long after the movie is over—if it wasn't any good, would I even spend so much time trying to figure out how to judge this flick? Good movies are enjoyable, great movies linger in your consensus. Like the thickest of peanut butter gluing to the roof of your mouth, Gone Girl will meander in your thoughts as you continuously struggle to soak in all the grim, all the insanity, and all the sheer hurricane of subtle tension you had just witnessed.If only it had less Vertigo.",9,4,14,8 October 2014
Django Unchained," Superb new-school Western with Tarantino flair
","In a sometimes-boring world of American Cinema, one can always count on the works of Tarantino to deliver some adrenaline to audiences everywhere. His style of zaniness, violence, and gleeful unpredictability has delivered some of the best movies in the past 25 years. Django Unchained is most certainly a Tarantino work, so if you love his antics, then you will not be disappointed. One little difference: This film is quite mature.Yes, Pulp Fiction and Kill Bill are spectacular movies, but they don't contain the subtle maturity of a Spielberg, Scorsese, or a Nolan. But with Django, it feels like a true-blue bloody Western with adult themes, superb storytelling, and fantastic performances and drama. It is all just mixed in with the special Tarantino touch. And yes, that touch includes Rick Ross blasting over the speakers during a backdrop of 1800s Mississippi.Django Unchained is about a bounty hunter that recruits a slave that knows the physical appearances of his next targets and all the adventures that follow. In the meantime the slave is on a hunt to locate his wife that was separated from him because of the slave trade. Essentially, this is like a revenge fairy tale for the folks who have had family that suffered from the harsh event in American history.Quentin Tarantino is one of the best screenwriters as well as best directors in this generation. There was a subtle worry that surrounded how he could handle a period piece without the crutches of clever pop culture and hipster dialogue. But just like Inglorious Basterds, Django Unchained is a pleasure to the ears with the great one-liners and dozens of wonderful moments that could have you laughing or could have you on the edge of your seat.This film is just an overall delight in nearly every sense of the word, from the cinematography to the acting (Christoph Waltz is absolutely amazing) to the editing to the content. There are no clichés in Tarantino's world. And yes, some of his small, small weaknesses do also pop up like when some scenes feel incomplete or when the movie as a whole drags just a bit too thin. However this film is just too much fun for those setbacks top let you down.Django Unchained is typical Tarantino, pure and simple. A little more mature, a little more subdued, but still delightfully out of control.",9,3,9,7 January 2013
Drive," A Multi-Layered Abuse to the Film Industry
","So I walked out of the movie Drive. This is the first time I've ever done such a thing. I've seen a lot of bad movies in my day but there has never been one that infuriated me to a point in which I couldn't continue. And being a film lover, I sat down and analyzed just why exactly this movie ticked me off so much. What was it about this movie that drove me up the wall to a point in which I walked out before I even got to see the conclusion? It wasn't the acting. It wasn't the music. And it wasn't the lush cinematography. What irked me the most was that Drive was disguising itself as an indie flick when in actuality it wanted to become an action movie so badly.And this strategy while an insult to the entire institution of filmmaking, worked. It got rave reviews at film festivals here and there and got nice reviews from critics, lavishing the acting, supposed tension, and cinematography. I watch this movie because of the rave reviews and literally saw the Transporter movie wrapped in an indie flavor, nothing more. The first half, where we supposedly see 'character development,' consists of characters engaging in extremely minimal small talk and the rest of the time just staring at each other. I am not kidding. After the tense opening which reveals our main character's secret job (which is familiar to the opening of Transporter), we get nothing for about 40 minutes. Except a lot of pointless scenes.Drive is about a very good stuntman that doubles as a secret driver at night (Ryan Gosling) who silently falls for his new neighbor (Carey Mulligan) while at the same time gets mixed up in a mob scene (which loosely is a Transporter plot). The first half has all the development, only in the second half is when we see all the action and driving you've been observing in the previews. Based off a novel of the same name, the script must have been easy to write, because it barely has any dialogue while the story is pretty much a mashup of Tarantino-like violence with Transporter-like symptoms.The movie is so inconsistent, and amongst the small pieces that don't fit together they are all sparkles of what we've seen before—and what we've seen before has all been superior. The supposed amazing chase sequences? Bourne and Ronin does them better----and to a similar budget extent, The Transporter. The supposed amazing violent tension? I can name dozens of movies that do it better. And the extreme violence that is inconsistent with the theme, tone, pace, and characterization of the first half of this slum? Of course, while it doesn't quite match the plot it's been perfected years upon years ago by Tarantino and even to an extent Robert Rodriguez.But another big reason why I dislike this film so much is because with Drive, we've seen it all before, and yet the critics will not point this out—or choose to avoid it. We've seen these types of movies before (quiet men that has their actions do all the talking), we've seen this type of ultra-action before, and we've seen these stupid attempts at conflicting and blending genres far too many times in the indie and mainstream scene. Drive was originally billed as blockbuster during development so what do they do? Hide the fact that it's the clichéd low-caliber blockbuster that's trying so hard to be a European Tarantino hybrid. They trimmed the dialogue, screen time, and for the Cannes Film Festival nixed the action billing and called it an independent film. They literally were changing the packaging and tone of the movie based off of box office numbers. That's disgusting. They were trying to sway the critics by changing the entire genre.Bottom Line: Drive, you are a pathetic, pointless, stupid, trite, slow, muggy, grudgy, tasteless, senseless, disposable, forgettable movie with abysmal pacing, abysmal writing, and no sense of direction whatsoever from the first second to the last second I watched before deciding to walk away. You don't know what movie you want to become, as you literally spit yourself through at least three different genres that actually repeal each other like a magnet. You barely clock in at 100 minutes, yet it felt like two hours the first half in. I will not blame the acting, for they had next to nothing to work with. I will not blame the cinematography, which wasn't bad either. I will blame the fact that your crew decided to pretend like your movie was artsy, underground, and indie, when in actuality your movie is this ultraviolent action movie that rears its ugly head long after the audience has fallen asleep through the numbing first half.Your movie sucks.Bad.",1,102,198,19 September 2011
Frozen," On its way to Pixar quality, Disney Animation Studios crafts yet another delightful post-Renaissance work of art
","Watch out Pixar.Disney Animation Studios is catching up to you.What Frozen lacks in laughs and overall soundtrack value its recovered through a wonderful script, a superb message, and a very likable cast of characters---even if its missing the clichéd Disney villain you love to hate. This movie contains some of the strongest Disney princesses in the history of the studio and also delivers delightful and unexpected twists to the family animation formula.Frozen follows the lives of two siblings to the royal throne that had to be separated after an unfortunate childhood incident. And by the time the rest of society can actually see them they've become two totally different princesses. Following a few complications, Princess Anna heads out into the frozen tundra to try to save her sister Elsa and the kingdom before the sudden wintery conditions become a threat to everyone's well-being.Jennifer Lee's script is the first full screenplay by a woman in Disney animation since Beauty and the Beast. And just like the 1991 masterpiece, Frozen contains strong female characterizations and themes that resonate well with viewers. But complimenting the strong script are some strong visuals and tones that resemble that of your favorite Broadway musicals. Frozen has a Broadway feel that hasn't been felt since The Lion King far back in the Disney Renaissance period. And this is because of excellent detailed animation work, great voice acting that doesn't rely on star power, and great direction by Lee and Chris Buck—an underrated mind that was behind the underrated Tarzan and extremely under-the-radar Surf's Up.Yes, the movie doesn't quite have the humor of Princess and the Frog (and the Disney animated wild card Emperor's New Groove) and lacks your classic Disney villain. But the likable cast of characters makes you immediately forget this, ranging from the not-as-annoying-as-you-may-think snowman Olaf to the charming rugged ice-vendor Kristoff. And even with the coldest character Princess Elsa you can't help but feel sympathy for her---especially after she delivers the show-stopping number (Let it Go) that is rising in the YouTube ranks.Frozen is continuing the encouraging trend of delightful and strong-willed female characters meshed into unique stories within the Disney company—Tangled, Wreck-It Ralph being the other previous examples. And to add to that, with Pixar losing some steam its good to see the original Disney Animation Studio recovering from the dark ages of the early 2000s.Despite the title, the movie's characters, themes, heart, and overall production value will warm the hearts of your kids, and you too.",8,3,6,4 January 2014
Cars 2," After many home runs, Pixar finally strikes out.
","Pixar is arguably the last remaining film company with a perfect track record. From Toy Story to Toy Story 3, each of their films had been met with grand acclaim and multiple Academy Awards. However, I can safely say the perfect track record ends this month. Cars 2 is a bafflingly disappointing movie that tastes even more bitter since its coming from Pixar, the makers of the best computer-animated films of all-time. Everything that has made Pixar movies range from decent to incredible to perfect was neglected here: from the mediocre script, to the lack of heart, to the lack of humor, right down to even commercializing their film a bit with some awkward product placements and a multitude of new characters that provide nothing more than just providing more toys to sell. Cars 2 was totally unnecessary, and just didn't deliver in any way shape or form---except for the animation.In Cars 2, we have this bizarre spy plot weaving in with a grand prix championship that takes place around the world. Without spoiling too much, there is a conspiracy going on throughout the grand prix and Tom Mater is sent on a mission to uncover who it might be. At the same time, it loosely threatens his relationship with Lightning. In terms of script, this was by far the weakest because there was no character development, minimal true conflict, no surprises, and it absolutely contradicts the lessons (mildly) learned in the original Cars movie. This movie was made purely for the kids as it offers very little subtle adult humor aside from all the snarly vehicle references.I will never understand why Pixar felt the need to create this movie whose only purpose was to make money and merchandise the heck out of it. You would think after billions of dollars in revenue with original and clever stories it would be enough to keep their creative juices flowing while at the same time deliver a profit for Disney. But this film was easy to market, easy to distribute. And with that comes laziness, and it was all-too prevalent here. Cars was the film least necessary in the Pixar lineup to warrant a sequel, prequel, whatever. Just the fact that Pixar drove a movie just for profit sake heavily tarnished their credibility as an animation studio that e used to believe was focused in telling great stories in multiple ways.Let's at least focus a bit on the positive. The voice cast was all back (with the exception of George Carlin and Paul Newman, of course) and with a few new voices in the mix. For the most part they did a good job, even though some didn't have much to work with, incredibly Owen Wilson as the main character Lightning being the main example. The animation was stunningly beautiful, but what else do you expect from Pixar? They are leagues ahead of the next-best animation studio, as their vehicles and settings were detailed down to a T. The action scenes were well-drawn out and have better cinematography as the typical action flick.And now we shall go back to complaining. The movie felt a lot like Speed Racer: it was a decent racing movie but had a plot too convoluted for children, yet had a premise that was appealing mostly to the kids. Cars 2 suffers from this same fate, it has a spy storyline that complicates itself to a point in which the kids will be utterly lost, but still doesn't have the feel of a movie that the entire family can enjoy—its more a movie for younger boys, who will be utterly lost once the second act kicks in. The movie also doesn't dwell into deeper adult themes like previous Pixar movies like Toy Story 3, Up, and (especially) The Incredibles.Bottom Line: Cars 2 is Pixar's first disappointment, and it hurts so much more because we know what the studio is capable of. What baffles me the most is the sheer minimal amount of effort to continue the trend and tradition of the preceding Pixar movies. Much like what happened with Indiana Jones 4 (which to this day I deny it exists), it deviated so badly from the formula of success that any strength it may have had is deterred by the fact that.we have seen so much better from that same staff. Cars 2 was pointless, redundant, lifeless, and just nothing like what we are used to seeing.The original was subtly hinted to be a pet project of Pixar's leader John Lasseter, and the only reason we are even seeing a sequel is because its Lasseter's pet and because merchandise sales were the greatest for Disney since 1994's The Lion King. Let's hope this is just a speed bump and not a downward spiral, because I would hate to see less Up-quality films and more Cars 2-quality flicks. Maybe this will be a wake-up call for the company--especially if they don't win the Best Animated Film Oscar next year. In the meantime, prepare for a snorefest if you are dragged to watch this. Pixar, you finally flopped. Took 25 years and countless good memories, but it has happened.",5,3,5,1 July 2011
Amadeus," The best movie of 1984. Among the best films of the 80s. Among the best films of all-time.
","While 1984 box-office-wise was dominated by Beverly Hills Cop and Ghostbusters, there is one film that rises above them all in terms of quality by miles upon miles. Amadeus is an excellent and superbly-crafted film that is most likely the greatest stage-to-film translation in the history of film-making. Combining exotic and fascinating sets with great cinematography, flawless acting, grand writing, great directing, and a well-picked soundtrack to blend it all together, Amadeus is a visual treat full of deep themes that will move and question your soul. The effort involved is most likely the reason why mainstream audiences believed that everything that happened in the film actually happened, when in fact it's based off of a popular play. In this tale about religion, greed, envy, music, passion, and love, there is an overwhelming amount of material presented in its above-average running time. Calling this the best movie of 1984 and one of the better movies of the 1980s isn't a stretch at all.Amadeus starts off with an elderly and bitter Antonio Salieri reaching a low point in his depression by attempting to kill himself. He then confesses to a priest his story about his life involving Mozart, and the film enters a flashback mode that jumps between the past and present; the present in the movie is merely Salieri evaluating the events that were going on. The majority of Amadeus is about Salieri as he struggles to find peace with himself and God after witnessing a childish vulgar man deliver some of the best, daring, experimental, and unbelievable music the world had ever laid its ears onmusic that is much better than anything Salieri could produce. Salieri's jealousy and rage gets the better of him as his quest for vengeance and victory spirals out of control at the same time as Mozart's un-expecting depressing spiral. The movie focuses on many themes, with God and religion being the dominant theme.The strongest quality Amadeus possesses is the excellent directing and writing. The writer and creator of the play was involved with the screenplay, and overall its Oscar-worthy material. Stripping the themes and major ideas from the play and turning it into a film-like medium, the movie itself is just as powerful as the stage version. Peter Shaffer's influences include several short stories about Mozart and many rumored tales that Salieri confessed to killing Mozart (which is heavily debated even today). Milos Foreman, known for directing 'One Flew over the Cukoo's Nest,' is at the top of his game here. We see many sweeping shots of the city streets, beautiful and massive sets for operas, performances, and musicals, and just so much more. It is one thing to have wonderful sets, but it takes a good director to know how to handle the 360 degrees of beauty surrounding the scene. Complimenting the directing is the editing, which apparently didn't win an Oscar. Try naming 10 scenes better-edited than the 'Requiem' scene towards the end.In a rare double-nomination moment in the Academy, both of the main characters were nominated for best acting, and both of them should have won (instead of just one of them). The acting in Amadeus is nearly flawless, from Tom Hulce as Mozart to F. Murray Abraham as Saliri, to even the smaller roles (See pre-Sex and the City Cynthia Nixon pull a good performance in a minor role). The cast excels the movie into rarely-reached heights, as the opera singers and dancers and performers enhance the authenticity of the period piece and the way the performances were done back in the 18th century/19th century. Even if you aren't a fan of the opera, you can't help but be startled by how long they can cling on to some of those notes.Bottom Line: Stretching this review any longer would be an insult, because it shouldn't require this many words to describe why everyone should see this movie at least once. Amadeus is an excellent movie, no doubt about it. There's too much going for it for you to ever complain about the nitty-gritty details. The only setback is how much fiction is involved, even though some of Mozart's seemingly-exaggerated accomplishments are indeed true (Yes he did write professional music at age 4, yes he used to be able to memorize an entire piece of music after just one listen, and yes he wrote operas at age 7). But forgetting the loose mesh of fact and fiction and you'll find a rich movie full of wonderful music, beautiful scenery, and memorable scenes. Recommend to the highest degree, especially if you are a fan of classical music, or better yet a fan of good movies. Amadeus: One of the shining gems of the 1980s.P.S. Someone come up with a great Beethoven movie, please, he deserves it.",10,1,2,30 September 2008
Kick-Ass," Pure comic book fanboy heaven
","There has been many, many, many, many, many, many, many (clt-v is awesome) comic book movies in the past several years, with some being good, some being bad, and some being downright ugly (Hulk anyone?). However, we rarely get movies that celebrate the entire genre the way horror was celebrated by Shaun of the Dead and Slither and spaghetti westerns were celebrated by almost anything Tarantino (loose exaggeration, I know). Kick-Ass however ends this drought by becoming the bad-ass, kick-ass, slam-bang roundabout kick to the face of a movie that the fans had been hoping for. This film is not just a nice homage to all things comics; it's also a wonderful story full of action, suspense, a bit of drama, and all blending in with dark humor. If you like your comic book movies raw, smart, engaging, and downright fun, then Kick-Ass should be your cup of martini.Kick-Ass is about a typical teenager named Dave (Aaron Johnson) that wants to become a superhero to help those in need, and to add a bit of purpose into his life. After accidentally being shown online trying to fight a gang, a slew of wanna-be superheroes followed suit, with some actually rising to become serious threats to villains of New York City. Based off a new-generation comic book written by Mark Millar and John Romita Jr., this film successfully takes the homages, grueling humor, and intense moments from the comic book and translates it to the screen with very little filler space. Written by the director Matthew Vaughn and Jane Goldman, Kick-Ass manages to cover a lot of ground, backstory and all, without ever dragging the movie. And unlike your usual comic book dialogue, there isn't a single line that made you want to cringe or squeal in disgust.What makes this movie totally work and keep you entertained, is the likability of every character on screen. Part of this has to do with the writing, but most of it is the superb acting. Aaron Johnson shines in the lead role, by mixing vulnerability with a delightful down-to-earth personality that's easy to relate to. In terms of emotions, Kick-Ass most resembles Spider-Man, a person who accidentally receives some powers but carries a lot of emotional weight with his newfound glory.Nicholas Cage and Chloe Moretz delivered the best performances by portraying a sentimental and deadly father-daughter team that provided some of the best laughs and some of the heavier moments. Moretz is incredible, especially for someone her age; she isn't your typical kid that curses only for laughs—she can kick your arse twelve times before you hit the ground. Its tough to make an audience convicted that a child can perform such maneuvers, but Kick-Ass pulls it off without breaking a single sweat.Matthew Vaughn is a much underrated director, but if he doesn't get any special love for his directing here, then I give up on critics nationwide. He directs this with such glee, such precision and such talent, the entire comic book movie world should start taking notes. The pacing is incredible, the surprises are well-hidden, and the action sequences are edited so tightly, it was inches from perfection. The fights and shootouts were brutal and didn't pull any punches, as you see blood, guts, and absolute mayhem right at your face. If the action were any closer to you, you'd walk out of the theater with burn marks and eternal scars.Kick-Ass succeeds as a great movie because it gleefully parodies, references, and imitates comic book movies of the past and the present. Spider-Man, Batman, Superman, and even Sin City had their small moments to shine as all of the characters going to the high school mention, read, talk about, and criticize comic book characters. This is a fanboy's movie, no question about it. Kick-Ass never tries to appeal to the mainstream, instead aims and hits the target at entertaining those in love with flipping to the next page to see the next comic panel. No PG-13 carnage here, you'll get all the blood, violence, sex, and humor that's usually in the bookstores but rarely is on-screen nowadays. You'll feel every punch, shot, and crushing blow---and you are going to love it.Bottom Line: Kick-Ass is kick ass. I know everyone is going to say the same thing from here on out, it's far too easy a compliment to give it. But, there's no other way to describe the 110 minutes. If you want a deeper explanation, we have a blend of good writing, good acting, good dosage of action, and good dosage of emotion, good directing, good pacing, and enough entertainment to cover the last couple comic book movie disappointments. Nicholas Cage is forgiven for Ghost Rider (not yet for Bangkok Dangerous.not yet), and fanboys yet again can flock to the theaters to see a film that was made strictly for them---much like Zombieland last year. Recommend to anyone that likes comics---new or old.",9,0,9,16 April 2010
Shrek the Third," The only character able to compete against Pixar quality-wise falls flat on his face the third time around
","Just how many more jokes and songs is the Shrek franchise going to borrow before it loses its identity and becomes confused as something else? Shrek the Third is a third offering of family entertainment that contains a slew of adult humor, pop culture references, and music from all kinds of genres and time periods. In other words, it is more of the same, and it is becoming old. Like a joke going bad, this film fails to deliver consistent laughs and fails to bring out the sympathetic moments of the original Shrek that started the anti-Disney campaign. While they lay off Disney's back a little, the anti-Disney content is still practically everywhere. If you listen close enough you can hear music imitating the theme to Pirates of the Caribbean. The magic (or anti-magic, if you want to be correct) has disappeared, sending the third installment into another typical animated farce that we have seen time and time again.With the king (John Cleese in a short role) suddenly croaking (har har har), Shrek (Mike Myers back to his old self) is the heir to the throne. The problem is, he does not want to rule a kingdom, he would much rather be back at the swamp with Fiona (Cameron Diaz in a surprisingly minor role). Things get worse then a few more ogres might be in play in the future and a frustrated Prince Charming (fantastic Rupert Everett). With the help of Donkey (Eddie Murphy, loud and proud) and Puss in Boots (Antonio Banderas scene-stealing again) Shrek attempts to find another heir to the kingdom. There's a lot going on, the writers were not afraid of packing the film with a lot of conflicts. Unfortunately though, some of them result rather abruptly and even in a lazy manner. The voice acting isn't half-bad, with Banderas and Everett leading the way and Justin Timberlake being rather mediocre. As a matter of fact, the casting was quite good with several cameos and most of the voices from before making a return.What kills Shrek the Third is the cast of underused characters and overused characters. The supporting cast in the first two Shrek films return and provide the most laughs, yet is limited to mere cameos. Even Fiona, a strong and important character in the original, is quite limited the third time around to make room for others. The other princesses, voiced by the female cast of Saturday Night Live, failed miserably in bringing any smart or humorous material. With limited screen time, the chemistry amongst the cast is also lacking, most notably the main three (Shrek, Donkey, Puss). The insane amount of borrowed material and jokes does not help at all, as we can draw content from Toy Story 2, Happily N'Ever After, Blazing Saddles, Looney Tunes, and more. Then we have some jokes that have worn out its welcome a long time ago, you'll know exactly what it is when it happens. Shrek the Third became a repeat of past viewings of other television shows and movies.The first act had potential, as they did not rely on pop culture but instead on physical humor and sight gags that does not involve burping, farting, or throwing up (which apparently and sadly runs the film to the very end). Then the film started collapsing in entertainment value when all the random music started kicking in, when the pop culture references start flying, and when the plot holes start appearing. Shrek the Third has easily the most plot holes in the series, and also isn't as well written as the other two. Shrek has been watered-down into a franchise just for the kids, as they aimed low in its humor. Replacing satire is gross-out humor that fails. The pacing wasn't as good; the climax was rather anti-climactic, and even the ending seemed rushed and effortless.Bottom Line: Shrek is nothing like the entertaining ogre we met years ago. The main characters stopped being funny, the supporting cast remains funny but very hidden in the midst of all that is going on, and Shrek the Third just practically fails overall. It is weaker than the second installment (despite the much better beginning) and is not even close as good as the first. With too many characters and running time under 100 minutes, we have quite a convoluted mess that did not know how to end so it ended suddenly, when you least expect it. Shrek is starting to lose his appeal to the mainstream, even though some can argue (*raises hand*) that he started losing it in the first sequel. Let this franchise die; don't make it dip any lower in quality. The kids may have a blast (even then that's a stretch) but the adults should all be quite disappointed with this lackluster blockbuster. Shrek the Third: No more please, three is quite enough. Thank you.",4,4,9,18 May 2007
The Hurt Locker," The Hurt Locker: War Movie + Quality + Tension + Excellent Direction - Accuracy
","Good war movies are hard to come by. Whether it's the political agenda, the abundance of clichés, or just the overkill of violence without consequence, its very hard to truly feel for a war movie. Saving Private Ryan didn't help either by raising the bar to a level that has yet to be even challenged. Spielberg's amazing masterpiece combines uncut violence with heart-thrashing tension, groundbreaking cinematography, and an intense amount of heart and undeniable evidence that war is absolute hell. Since 1998, there hasn't been a single war movie to come even close in terms of quality. However, in 2009 we were dangerously close. The Hurt Locker was a quiet wartime film that swept away the hearts of critics and quietly became the Oscar favorite in the summertime. Instead of World War 2, the setting was the Iraqi war, which has its share of film clunkers. Instead of focusing on the battlefield, The Hurt Locker focused instead of a group of soldiers hired to prevent bombs from going off and killing innocent civilians. What we have is a decent script, nearly flawlessly directed by an underrated director, with a superb cast of actors involved. While the movie misses the masterpiece ranks by not digging deeper into the human psyche and providing clichés it had avoided in the first two acts, it's a great film that mixes suspense, action, and unbearable tension. This movie, like previously stated, focuses on a small group of soldiers who are part of the bomb squad. They are in charge of making sure no civilians get hurt with any of the bombs that are sprinkled throughout the country. While the accuracy of the content within the film has been heavily contested and criticized, the movie focuses much less towards the big picture (The war itself) and instead focuses on several smaller incidents that are usually little blurbs in American newspapers everywhere. While you loosely read about a suicide bombing, The Hurt Locker throws you right in the middle of the scenario at hand. This Mark Boal script is a page-turner because of the immense suspense and tension involved, and because it allows you to see just how violence and death affects your average soldier. Boal obviously didn't have experience in the battlefield, but knows how to tell a good story.Accuracy takes a sidetrip, because this film's strong point is the quiet, unnerving action that slowly ruins the psyche of everyone involved, even if they rise victorious. The acting and directing allows the anxiety to spew its way into the viewers. Jeremy Renner provides an Oscar-worthy performance of a soldier that seems to show no fears of death, but at the same time show signs of pure panic. Renner behaves a certain way with a bomb involved, and behaves another way when in a situation that is not his usual calling. But Anthony Mackie is just as effective as a tough-as-nails soldier that shows his true colors when death stares right back. Oddity of this movie is that the bigger names took the smaller roles, including David Morse and Ralph Fieness. Kathryn Bigelow's film career spans many decades, but had only one hit with Point Break. In The Hurt Locker however, she directs her finest work by stretching many scenes far longer than most directors would dare, turning little situations into extended moments of emotional torture. The sniper scene is the most controversial amongst the critics because of its length and spaghetti western-like pacing. But this scene (like the other troublesome scene involving the main character seeking vengeance) perfectly describes the feelings of the soldiers involved and remains constant with the harsh theme attached: you cannot trust anyone. Every situation has the soldiers pitted in an environment they don't fully know, containing people they know nothing about, as they desperately try to figure out who is a bystander and who is a potential terrorist. The directing is what propels this movie into such high acclaim. If there is someone to thank for the Best Picture nomination, its Bigelow. Sadly, The Hurt Locker misses the mark because of the final act. The final act has a few of the clichés that it had avoided for so long. If the movie had run a bit less, than it would be amongst the great war classics like Saving Private Ryan, Platoon, and Full Metal Jacket. While mentioning which ones specifically would lead to potential spoilers, just know that it throws the film off and leads to a rather quick ending. The writing was great, but one would have hoped for a deeper analysis into the minds of the emotionally drained men. Bottom Line: Don't let that bring you down though, because The Hurt Locker is a superb film with great writing and even better directing. Becoming the second-most tense movie of 2009 (Inglorious Basterds takes the cake) The Hurt Locker combines thrills, emotional chills, and enough suspense to make Hitchcock and Spielberg very proud. It dwells away from the average wartime movie by giving us a look into another type of wartime combat, the one that involves bomb detonating and trying to see who is on your side and who isn't. This is the best war movie since Saving Private Ryan, and is one of the best flicks of 2009.",8,4,11,5 March 2010
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales," The Two Hour Continuity Error
","The Pirates franchise has been a bit of a doozy since it's shocking box office success way back in 2003. Curse of the Black Pearl was never meant to house a sequel, as it was an open-and-shut swashbuckler flick that was heavy on energy, action, humor, and blockbuster soul. It garnished tons of Oscar nominations (and money), upped Johnny Depp's persona several notches, and helped give Disney the box office crown in 2003. 14 years later we see the fifth installment, with the second consecutive attempt at creating a new Will/Elizabeth love story, the second consecutive attempt to replace the underrated director of the original trilogy Gore Verbinski, and once again taking the crown as arguably the most expensive film shoot in cinematic history.Production hell doesn't begin to describe the attempts to create the fifth movie, even though On Stranger Tides was met with very poor reviews. Johnny Depp refused the original idea, which would have featured a female villain for the first time. Johnny Depp was going through a nasty divorce and got injured, delaying the shoot even longer. Disney and Bruckheimer were arguing about costs, and the script itself (which is a disaster we can describe later) was undergoing changes and multiple hands. And I'll still never understand how the writer of Rush Hour 3, Speed 2, and Tower Heist managed to get his hands on such a big film. Oh Hollywood The only company willing to cling on to a sinking ship of a film is Disney, simply because their patience constantly gets rewarded, and it's impossible to discontinue a franchise that has earned them a nasty 3.8 billion within only four films. So after epic struggling for many years, we finally see Dead Men Tell No Tales gracing the screen.Not going to lie, this film is an entertaining mess, and part of the wave of recent sequels/prequels that went through similar production issues which affected the final product. Alien: Covenant went through tons of trouble, and then we see Fate of the Furious have to find a way to edit out the obvious tension between Dwayne Johnson and Vin Diesel. But the Pirates franchise is more than just a cluster of movies, its part of the Disney fandom culture, it has a life of its own through video games, books, and mysteries and intrigue surrounding it all. So copying, abandoning and contradicting plot elements of the original trilogy gives this movie a layer of frustration we didn't need, and we definitely don't deserve after such a long wait. Even after the entertaining first half, it all gets damaged by the unmet potential and by the awkward familiarity of the plot. And this comes from the Disney Company, a film studio notorious for being vigorously detailed with all of its IPs, from Marvel to (especially) Star Wars.Another curse that doesn't allow the cursed to touch land? Sounds familiar. Woman who doesn't believe in the oceanic supernatural mumbo-jumbo? Sounds familiar. A person who denounces pirates suddenly becomes one? Also sounds familiar. British navy trying to conquer the seas from the pirates? Heh, okay. The entire plot line felt very similar to Curse of the Black Pearl, yet this installment felt like it was tapping the brakes far too much. This watered down and clownish Jack Sparrow didn't perform any swordplay once, he didn't trick anyone a single time, I don't think he even delivered any clever quips of any kind. The villain didn't have a final showdown against Jack, as we witness a CGI-laden chase as our climax, a far cry from the dizzying mayhem during the big showdown in Dead Man's Chest. Worst of all, we didn't get the dramatic showdown between the enemy ships and the Flying Dutchman, the ship that you know, controls the damn seas, and has a captain that's related to someone that is in danger throughout the film! The potential was there, and wasn't met. From script to direction to storytelling decisions, Dead Men Tells No Tales has us wishing for the original writing team and the original director to somehow bring this franchise back to decent waters. This film only further enhances At World's End and Dead Man's Chest—two films that were met with ho-hum reviews but have honestly aged well and remain better than most of your modern-day blockbusters. The script here opens the door for many intriguing scenes, and they didn't deliver. We could have explored Jack Sparrow's aging and increasing alcoholism, Barbossa's past, the Flying Dutchman/Salazar curse connection, the fallout of the elongated separation of Will and Elizabeth, and the series-shifting scene of breaking every curse. And after seeing this, I don't have much hope in the eventual sixth installment touching these story lines either.The Pirates of the Caribbean series now looks like its more interested in the international box office receipts and just keeping people entertained above keeping the flavor of the franchise and keeping a continuity between each chapter. On Stranger Tides, despite the mediocrity, had interesting unresolved story lines that were completely neglected here. The original trilogy's details don't match up with the backstory of Jack Sparrow in Dead Men Tell No Tales.You will see some high-budget fun, comical mayhem, a good performance by Javier Bardiem, but it all gets evaporated when we reach the series-changing yet series-contradicting final act. The franchise is far from being dead, but boy it might be time to let this ship disappear out into the horizons unless we get a superior cast writing and filming it. Jack Sparrow and all his fans deserve much better.Blog: https://coffeeandscriptblog.wordpress.com/",6,33,59,6 June 2017
The Illusionist," A rare, but excellent movie-going treat
","The popularity of the average magician is fading away into obscurity. No longer are they amongst the most popular celebrities out there like in the much older days centuries ago. A good magician film is even harder to find. With technology progressing the way it does nowadays, it is even harder to craft a good magician film without it being overblown or revealed with special effects. The Illusionist however, is a diamond in the rough, a rare exception in which when special effects is required, it delivers, but in such small doses that the magic comes off as almost believable. To add to the stunning visual effects is a magnificent score, an emotional love story, a murder mystery, suspense, drama, great writing, decent directing, and magnificent cinematography. Emerging almost out of nowhere back in 2006, it has become a surprise hit and with good reason too.The Illusionist follows the life of a controversial magician by the name of Eisenheim (Edward Norton) that has a very unique and special gift that allows for him to do things that other people only dream about being able to do. But, despite his talents, his position in the social circle of Europe prevents him from getting a certain amount of respect. What's worse is that his love (Jessica Biel) just happens to be higher up in the social ladder, and it would be almost impossible for them to be together. Using his talents, his wits, and persistence, he tries to win his dream girl Sophie and stay away from the troubles of a corrupt inspector (Paul Giamatti) and the crown prince (Rufus Sewell).What else is there to say about this film? Its woven together beautifully and presented magnificently. We'll start by praising the acting. Edward Norton, whose previous work has proved his ability as a superb actor (Especially Fight Club), shines yet again as the main character. You can almost feel his sorrow, his despair when he is at his emotional low points. Jessica Biel, despite her start at a mediocre family dramedy, does a swell job as Eisenheim's love interest. Mixing her natural beauty with vulnerability in her eyes Biel is impressive as a woman stuck in a world she obviously doesn't belong in. Surpassing them both is Paul Giamatti, whose work has quite a range (Big Fat Liar, Big Momma's House, Sideways), yet nails it home portraying the calm yet rather lost Inspector Uhl.Continuing on the praise express, the next stop is congratulating the writer for lacing a great screenplay out of a relatively unknown short story. Full of details, plot twists, mysteries, and tense moments, you as the audience are left mesmerized and unaware of what is about to happen next. Taking advantage of a fine script, the director (Neil Burger, who happens to be the writer as well) and cinematographer (Dick Pope) capture all the majesty and mastery of our main character and the unsolved questions of the conflicts by displaying beautiful scenery, a knack for tone, and the ability to drop off little clues and fine points as the movie charges along from one scene to the next. Also helping progress The Illusionist is the original score of Philip Glass, which stands as one of the best composers in Hollywood today.The third act is where everything falls into play and the true abilities of everyone involved is revealed. In the third act, we see the best in directing, music, acting, and writing, as the ending comes almost out of nowhere but comes off as so refreshing, you cannot help but have a smile on your face as the credits roll. Unlike most films, the final moments of the movie rewards the audience by revealing the tricks that not only the magician but also the director had pulled right in front of your eyes. The Illusionist serves as a piece of work that is a magic trick: there is the teaser, the scenario, and then before you know it, the magic.Bottom Line: A nice movie that exceeded expectations and stunned critics and audiences alike, The Illusionist serves as a unique movie going experience that is quite captivating and entertaining to watch. With a hint of mystery with romance, drama, suspense, and themes of love, fate, and life against death, this serves as one of 2006's biggest and most underrated surprises. Firing on all cylinders and hitting the mark quality-wise in all aspects of film-making, it's really hard to find something wrong with this picture. Morality issues may be sparking once the film is done, but in terms of technical issues and directing techniques, there's very, very little to complain about here. Highly recommend, hopefully we'll see more of Neil Burger in the near future.",10,3,5,5 March 2007
Fantastic 4: Rise of the Silver Surfer," Rated PG. Same staff from the original. Same actors. We might have a problem here
","Not only does the entire cast of the original Fantastic Four return for a second installment, the flaws make a return as well. Whether it's the painfully obvious product placement, the bad acting, lack of action, cheesy lines, pointless scenes, lack of chemistry amongst the main two characters, low usage of the villains, mediocre treatment of the villains, lack of character development, or the abundance of jokes falling flat, Rise of the Silver Surfer is practically a prettier and more polished version of the original failure film. While it is a much more entertaining movie than the first, it still needs a bit more work in order to even compete with the hotshot comic book franchises like X-Men, Spider-Man, and Batman.In Rise of the Silver Surfer, we see the Fantastic Four preparing for the wedding of the century, as finally Reed and Sue are getting married. However, there are new threats approaching, hindering the wedding and also messing with the fate of the world. An alien from outer space is entering Earth and creating massive craters for unknown reasons. To add to the mayhem is a return of an old villain, whose hatred towards the heroes is stronger than ever. Upon all this lies an even greater danger lurking deep in space. Quite a lot for a film that's only 92 minutes. This would explain the lack of development and lack of action sequences.We can start by bashing the acting. Besides the performances of Chris Evans (Human Torch) and Michael Chiklis (The Thing), the acting in Rise of the Silver Surfer is rather awful and laughable, even at the more emotional moments. There are several scenes in which are accidentally funny, and many lines awkwardly delivered, especially that by Ioan Gruffudd (Reed) and Julian McMahon (Dr. Doom). Not supporting the lack of decent acting is the writing, which becomes just as dreadful. There is a lot of cheesy dialogue in this movie, and while the story had potential, ultimately doesn't deliver because of the lack of screen time share by the Silver Surfer and Dr. Doom. Most of the movie we see the Fantastic Four fighting and bickering amongst themselves, while the villains kick back and wait for their moment to shine.There are many good stories in the Fantastic Four comic books; it shouldn't be that hard to flesh out a good storyline involving the heroes and villains. The handling of the villains and enemies are just as bad as in the original. Dr. Doom is one of the roughest scoundrels in all of Marvel, yet is limited to a mere joke and side note in the second installment. Doom was wreaking a bit more havoc the second time around, but yet again doesn't deliver the sense of danger and fear that is presented by over villains in other comic book films. The Silver Surfer is heavily underused, as he was able to showcase his cool-looking powers in just one chase sequence and another run-in later in the movie. Also not helping is how the audience is never able to explore the origins or the motivations of the mysterious being. Worst of all is the totally unique image and portrayal of the planet-eating monster Galactus. There are comic book fans that will squeal in anger upon seeing its appearance.The short action sequences of Fantastic Four were nicely handled and drawn-out, but just didn't last long enough. There weren't enough showdowns, not enough epic battles, and most certainly did not deliver on the climax. By the end we'll see stupid departures and a slew of cop-outs, as well as anti-climactic scenes, massive plot holes, and unnecessary emotionally heavy moments (you'll see why). The special effects were a mixed bag as well, as the Silver Surfer and doomsday effects were done nicely--but then contradicted by the effects of the Fantastic Four in action (especially the stretching done by the main character). Add a ridiculous dance sequence, bad jokes sprinkled, and blatantly obvious product placement, and we have ourselves the biggest disappointment of the summer blockbuster season.Bottom Line: With so many things wrong and going against it, Rise of the Silver Surfer disappoints and is a letdown in almost every single possible way. Granted its better than the original, the franchise still needs major changes, or at least a totally different cast. Is it too late for a Fantastic Four Begins? Seriously, stop making a joke out of the enemies. Stop screwing around with a potentially good franchise. This movie isn't going to attract any new fans nor would it please the people already fans of the comic book. Skip this and read the books, you'll be much more entertained and have a better chance of feeling like you got your money's worth.",3,4,9,16 June 2007
Transformers," 'Left cheek! Left cheek! Left cheek!!'
","This following review has no product placement whatsoeverthe movie being reviewed has done enough of that on its own. Transformers is a great idea turned sour because of pitiful writing, bad directing, sloppy acting, weak editing, and a slew of perky little flaws that some people will catch but others will totally miss. With such a heavy budget, one would think that they could hire better writers, right? And Mr. Bay, why on earth do you still attempt to add emotion to your mind-numbingly loud movies? The special effects were indeed amazing and the CGI work was nearly flawless, but that gets tampered by all the lower-budget work involved. This movie could have been cut by nearly 40 minutes, the pacing was slow, it was just all wrong. To fail this movie would be exaggerating considering the intensive effort into making the robots (and the effects were executed perfectly) but do not expect anything worthy of being among the summer popcorn champs past and present.In a mindless action movie, a plot isn't totally necessary but something has to be established in order to give the viewer a reason to continue watching despite all the explosions and body parts flying. Transformers doesn't have a weak plot (Powerful cube-like object embedded in the Earth and two armies of alien robotic things fighting to obtain it) but the dialogue is easily the weakest portion of the film. It must have been so hard for the actors and actresses to not laugh at some of the insanely cheese things they have to say. Bay hasn't been very lucky with the whole dialogue thing (Pearl Harbor, The Island) but its reached a new low here. What also mars this movie is the endless amount of clichés sprinkled all over the place. The pretty-female-with-jerk cliché has been done way, way, way too many timesplease stop now. Oh, and let's not forget the barrage of plot holes too (How can ANYONE outrun a Transformer?!)Acting was rather wooden as well. Despite decent performances from Jon Voight, Rachael Taylor, and John Turturro (hey, its not his fault he had so many bad lines) the acting was pretty weak. The voice acting amongst the Transformers was a mixed bag, and Shia LaBaouf comes off as pretty annoying sometimes. The lead female, Megan Fox, is amazingly pretty but that was about it. Speaking of wooden, let's discuss the musical score, which seems to borrow from all other popcorn flicks, including previous Bay works.The worst part of Transformers is Michael Bay himself. Despite the screenplay, he could still craft a clever action movie; it has been done before (The Rock, Bad Boys anyone?). Instead, we get the hypersensitive camera work, the spinning-cam that Bay has suddenly fallen in love with, too many long shots of people looking at something, and then too many close-ups during the fights, resulting in a mess of a battle. Sometimes, its extremely difficult to see who is fighting what and who is the hero and who is the villain. Like Fantastic Four: Silver Surfer, there were little action quips, but no major action sequences until the very end; which even then consists of a lot of miniature battles jumbled up into one final showdown.In order to get to the action we've all been craving, we have to put up with pointless and useless character development and unnecessary scenes that made the movie at least 40 minutes longer. Michael Bay is no Spielberg; he cannot portray emotion for the life in him. His pacing is really fast when conflict is spewing, but when this isn't happening the gears shift into negative third gear. Spielberg should have been working on this, since summer popcorn blockbusters is his specialty (Jurassic Park, Indiana Jones trilogy, Minority Report, Jaws, War of the Worlds). Bay should have just made this a frenzied action film, instead of a complete film full of all sorts of genres, from comedy to action to romance.Something not to gripe about however are the incredible special effects. The robots look absolutely fantastic, and their movements flow beautifully. Despite the camera moving too much and not finding the right range, the robots going at it is one of the best-looking CGI shots in the history of cinema, and we've been very blessed with incredible special effects this summer with At World's End. The audience was applauding every single time that a robot was first revealedunfortunately they don't get much screen time. As a matter of fact, some just ultimately disappear from the film altogether, while some have extended periods of absence. Nonetheless, when you do see them, your jaw will drop in amazement.Bottom Line: Wonderful special effects destroyed by practically all other aspects of the film. Whether it's the bad acting, bad writing, bad directing, bad pacing, or just overall all-around bad clichéd cheese, Transformers is a very good idea turned sour because it fell into the wrong hands. Bay should stay away from all attempts of adding emotion to film and just blow things up and create carnage. However, he even screwed that up by giving the camera a bad case of Parkinson's. Transformers may entertain the hardcore fans but it will take a while to see the action that's been advertised heavily in the media everywhere. Watch it once, see it for the booms and kapows and blams, and then forget about it like most of Bay's other works. Wait, what else has Bay directed?",4,1,5,7 July 2007
Coco," The Powerful Sabor of Coco
","Pixar has traveled through murky quality waters since arguably the greatest quality run in the history of filmmaking (2007-2010, research it), with Cars 3 sputtering earlier this summer. And with Lasseter shenanigans, lay offs, secret struggles with several projects, the once-invincible animation studio is beginning to show its wear and tear. Coco successfully rights the ship by offering a very engaging storyline that hits every emotion you can possibly fathom and even though its subject matter might scar and emotionally deteriorate some of the youngsters, the film overall is a superb work of detail, love, and a respect for the audience and the culture its representing.The respect towards Mexican culture and folklore is the backbone and most crucial element in the film—messing it up ever so slightly would create all sorts of problems. Luckily despite the recent struggles Pixar remains the best and brightest of the animation studios in terms of sheer detail. From the visible damage on Wall-E to the 'jail tattoos' on the Toy Story 3 cast, Pixar's history towards meticulous subtle touches keeps them above the competitors at all times. Coco's Mexico (dead and alive) is about as vibrant an atmosphere as you'll ever see in cinema. Animation allows for the scope to be infinitely larger than any live-action sequence, and the animators use every penny of budget and every fiber of talent to deliver two stark yet expansive environments linked together by the Dia De Los Muertos that operates as an extra character in the charming tale of a boy in an anti-musical family trying to follow his dream and become a musician—against the protests and warnings.Whatever this movie lacks in humor (to be honest, it's hard to laugh when the pain is so damn deep) is recovered by the beautiful story and surrounding themes about family, forgiveness, sacrifice, death, and legacy. Being the black sheep of the family and potentially becoming that broken link in the family bond (which is a conflict that is by far stronger in Hispanic culture as compared to most others) is a conflict well-executed by Lee Unkrich and the entire writing team (how Pixar can churn out gems with four writers is a baffling mystery, while working on a script I argue with myself). Managing to find light in the darkness of a film centered around death is a tough task, and it can get quite heavy-handed.The world of the deceased is one that was whimsical, creative, vibrantly colorful, and easily the strongest visual of Coco. I also wish it was explored a little more. At the same time, I would have also loved to see more of Pixar's Mexico, which perfectly nailed the Central American vibe within the opening frames. And at over 100 minutes, it's interesting how the film reveals so much, yet keeps you seeking more, similar to the settings created by Miyazaki. I'm not asking for an arsenal of irritating Frozen-sized featurettes surrounding the world of Coco (I went there, and I don't care), but Mexico and the Land of the Dead deserves some revisiting. The core of the film is the quest of the boy, and no time is wasted sending him on a seemingly impossible task of finding his inspiration to become a musician while running out of life, literally.The secondary characters, the family on both sides of the fence, add a burst of life to an already-vibrant movie. This is supported by strong writing that guarantees no one-dimensional characters, and an excellent ensemble voice cast that deliver flawless performances (special nod to the singers of the spellbinding soundtrack) to help keep the heart of Coco very strong. And in keeping with recent Disney tradition, plot twists and surprising antagonists emerge towards the final act, which ironically gives it a slight twitch of predictability. But as the constant theme in this review, all flaws small and major are forgiven because of the personality and soul of Coco, which will make you smile and simultaneously break you.Mexico was very well-represented to a point that I was secretly irrationally demanding more (the soundtrack should have been sung entirely and only in Spanish for example), but succeeds in not being a movie with Mexicans, but being a pure Mexican flavored film. Coco is one of the best films of the year, the best animated film of 2017 by a long shot, containing one of the best music scores in quite some time, and a delightful 100 minutes that you should spend with family and friends—-so you can all ugly cry together and see who looks the worst.Original Blog: https://coffeeandscriptblog.wordpress.com/",9,1,4,9 December 2017
Lincoln," Spielberg's dream come true.....?
","One of Spielberg's ultimate dreams was to be able to make a Lincoln film. And after over a decade of speculation, we finally see the master director's vision come true---albeit in a manner we didn't really expect. While the film focuses mainly on Lincoln it narrows the structure down to his final months of the presidency and his life. Instead of the log cabin child to lawyer to president timeline, we get the end of war to 13th amendment timeline. But although it is masterfully acted and directed, it's a tough pill to swallow because of the length and because of its focus on the bare-knuckle politics of the time period.To keep it simple: if you dislike politics this will not be your cup of tea.This film however isn't without its assortment of strengths. For starters, let's please give the Oscars to Daniel Day-Lewis and Tommy Lee Jones, because they did phenomenal in their perspective roles. The rest of the cast did outstanding, ranging from Sally Field to James Spader to Hal Holbrook. Arguably the best ensemble cast within the past year, Lincoln is a movie that could have posed as a Broadway show because it was the acting that stole the show and maintained the film.However I can almost bet you anything that Steven Spielberg would have preferred a superior script that focused much more on Lincoln's life and less on the politics surrounding it. Nonetheless, he did a grand job with the script on the table and doesn't overdue or overblow the film with an abundance of style. It was framed like a high-budget play, and was paced like one. And this is where the audience can become alienated; in terms of content politics covets about eight-tenths of the movie.And this is where the film becomes to unravel mildly. If Lincoln had found a good balance between the president's personal life, political life, and life dealing with the war, we would have had ourselves a loaded movie that will push for the Best Picture prize. Instead, we have a movie that doubles-down heavily on politics and the maneuvers done to accomplish what Lincoln set out to do---while sacrificing a few key moments in the president's life. The ending in particular comes off as awkward because of the clunky catharsis and unique editing choices.After a slow start and a grand second act, Lincoln winds up mere inches from becoming one of the better movies of 2012 because it stumbles towards the end. Great performances and simplistically quality directing was marred by questionable editing choices and a final act that couldn't decide what ending to choose from. This most likely isn't the Lincoln film Spielberg wanted, but nearly crafted a diamond out of coal.A few Oscars are in place here, but Best Picture isn't one of them. Nonetheless, it's still an entertaining political drama that is sure to cement Day-Lewis and Spielberg as among the best in their proper craft.",7,0,2,19 January 2013
Big Hero 6," The Student is catching up to the Teacher
","There was an interesting cinematic juxtaposition that occurred on the weekend of November 6th, 2014.Just as the silently sputtering and problematic Pixar announced yet another sequel, this time a pointless one to a masterpiece of a trilogy that ended perfectly, we see the Walt Disney Animation division deliver yet once again another surprisingly powerful and entertaining film. Continuing a quality streak that began with 2009's Princess and the Frog, Walt Disney Animation Studio has essentially created a second Renaissance that has delivered quality Oscar-winning films (Frozen) as well as a few surprises (Wreck-It Ralph). With Big Hero 6, we see a great animated film devoid of a love story or princesses that is full of humor, heart, action, and overall entertainment.The Disney formula is alive and kicking in Big Hero 6, as we have the themes of heavy loss, the strong villain, the essential supporting cast that steals the show, and of course minimal surprises that doesn't deviate the movie too far from its main course of entertaining the kids and adults alike. And although the Disney formula prevents Big Hero 6 from reaching the necessary shock in your better comics and comic book inspired movies like The Incredibles, it's still a fun flick that becomes a nice departure from your recent influx of animated and superhero sequels.Part of the requirements of making the ultimate comic book film includes a unique look and feel that distances itself from other works—whether it's the toxic dark Gotham City or mythological-laden Asgard. One of the best aspects of Big Hero 6 is how deep and engaging the world of San Francisokyo is, as the visual range of the city is just as expansive as the environments of recent Disney movies like Frozen, Tangled, and even Wreck-It Ralph. This gives the added visual flair to the chases and action sequences sprinkled throughout the two hours.Just as spellbindingly good as the animation was, it was the powerful and quick-moving script that propels Big Hero 6 to the next quality level. Although it is based off of a Marvel comic, the adaptation is extremely loose, extremely watered-down, and toned down to appeal to a wider audience---while at the same time giving it a necessary dosage of likability that was absent in the original comic. The trio writing team crafted a screenplay that acts like an origin story but paces like a complete film. There just isn't enough time to give the correct amount of attention to the delightful supporting cast of characters (and its crafty anime-influenced villain) but luckily our well-rounded hero (aptly named Hiro) and his robotic pal have strong personalities, and a strong friendship to propel the movie forward. Beymax has layers of depth that the trailers and commercials could never convey.Although the tropes and current financial strategies of the Disney company (and suddenly Pixar) prevents Big Hero 6 from truly reaching the stars (Because we all know what happens to successful Disney animated movies), we are still treated to a well-directed wholesome blend of comedy, drama, and action swirled around a cool comic book setting wrapped in a Disney bow. From beginning to end this film will entertain, will move you, will make you laugh, and will make you cry. Even if it's a few feet from reaching 1999-2009 sans-Cars Pixar level (then again, this epic run may not happen again from any film studio), Disney Animation is doing a fantastic job fully recovering from Eisner's attempted murder of the animation studio.After spending years following in Pixar's footsteps, it looks like the Walt Disney Animation Studio has just about caught up.",8,6,28,11 November 2014
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," A Soon-To-Be Controversial Product From the Disney Machine
","Love or hate Disney and the direction they have taken with all of your beloved childhood favorites (or Lord, what are they going to do to The Simpsons?!?!!?), they are the company everyone else is looking up to. They have 5 of the 10 highest-grossing movies in cinema history, the highest-grossing American film of all-time, and in the year 2017 own 4 of the 10 most successful films globally-and this is with Star Wars and perhaps even Coco making its way towards the top. They have their crap figured out in an era where Hollywood is struggling to go up against indie cinema, Netflix, digital streaming, and the YouTube generation of sheer creativity, incredible access to the past, and overanalyzation.Point is: Disney has a plan, they always have a plan to beat and defy the odds. Disney hardly missteps and when they do, it's because they become arrogant or take too big a risk. They are basically the Golden State Warriors of American entertainment, they are their own worst enemy. All this must be remembered when viewing The Last Jedi, because this film has Disney's psychotic blueprints all over it, even in the midst of all the risks they clearly take in the eighth installment of the beloved and slightly polarizing franchise. The Last Jedi is a visual feast, a dramatic work that will flood the fanbase with controversial decisions, and overall yet another step in the right direction for a franchise that was sputtering just a decade ago. Disney has indeed made treasure out of trash, and has given an intense breath of life to a series that has spanned five different decades-from film to comics and books.This span hinders the current trilogy more than anything. In the real world, people age, people die (look at what happened to the Harry Potter and Matrix series after key actors passed), unexpected twists and turns occur, and screenplay decisions sometimes has to bounce off what is happening once the cameras stop rolling. The Last Jedi is most definitely affected by Carrie Fisher's passing, the aging of multiple actors, the sheer amount of time and scope since it all began, and of course a legion of hungry yet hesitant fans that have been collected in different generations, leading to differing views on where Star Wars has been and where it should go. This movie is great, yet polarizing. It will have its enemies and defectors, and Disney doesn't care.To say I agree with all the events of The Last Jedi is inaccurate, but nonetheless within the 150+ minutes there's a passion, a magic that cannot be explained. The camerawork, the soundtrack, the visual effects are top-notch and keeps in line with the Star Wars look and feel. Rian Johnson's take on Star Wars mixes the same formula with a few unique quirks and some subtle and not-so-subtle contemporary commentary on the way the world (or in this case, universe) works. The dialogue isn't as wooden, and the characters aren't as one-dimensional as what we're used to in Star Wars. The original trilogy in the midst of all its greatness was pretty darn black-and-white. Just like in The Force Awakens and especially Rogue One, The Last Jedi doesn't operate this way. From Rey to Luke to Kylo Ren, their motives and emotions constantly shift and develop.The story in the eighth installment is actually much more grounded than the previous films, as it mainly involves a race against time as the First Order is inches away from fully destroying a small Resistance group led by Leia that is desperately just trying to escape the clutches from the overpowering legion of enemy ships. At the same time, Rey is trying to figure out her place while also attempting to convince Luke Skywalker to join the tiring fight that seems to be tilting heavily towards the First Order. The Last Jedi is a mental and physical race, as everyone is running out of time, patience, options, and most importantly hope. The theme of hope in a cruel world is very much prevalent here, much like in Rogue One.All your favorite characters from The Force Awakens returns, even though some are very short on screentime (because your entourage of questions and hunger for more content will lead to book sales for Disney; and yes they are evil). I assure you, some of you will walk out disappointed in the lack of focus on some. And yet no matter how lengthy the build-up feels, the payoffs were consistently gratifying, and then we have cameos left and right tossed in for good measure. There was plenty of action and different locales, but we needed more. There was plenty of interaction between the new school and the old school, but we needed more. The Last Jedi felt like a main course that was plentiful, yet left you hungry for more. And if you think this is an accident, then you are missing the entire picture. Disney (once again) prevents one of their films from going truly mad and absolutely crazy, once again not all the cards are left on the table. This was the biggest problem with Force Awakens, and other massive Disney blockbuster movies like Age of Ultron, Civil War, and especially Dead Man's Chest (which just missed being an all-time blockbuster masterpiece)-just a cinematic tapping of the brakes. You see three movies making up a trilogy, Disney sees seven through nine as three episodes of a massive television series, each with their cliffhangers to keep you thirsty and desperate for resolution and answers.Force Awakens was the salad and drink, just to start the process. The Last Jedi, as enjoyable as it was, definitely felt like the hearty appetizer leading to a (hopefully outstanding) main course that we won't receive until 2019. You can disagree with this direction, as even Empire Strikes Back didn't quite feel this empty by the final frame. But, this is the current system of Disney filmmaking and as long as they keep getting top-tier talent to produce top-quality content in a current age of cinema that can become frustratingly dry in large sections, this is a formula that will not change.The Last Jedi is quality from a filmmaking and production standpoint. From music to cinematography to directing, this film is no slouch and is even deserving of some Oscar nominations (although lack of screentime really hurts the outstanding Adam Driver and even Mark Hamill from theirs). However, this movie will upset fans, especially some of the old-school fans guaranteed. Personally to me Star Wars has become so big that we each have our interpretation of the franchise. This is why only some love the prequels (those poor souls), why only some enjoy the Clone Wars series, only some enjoy the current films, and why only some will truly hate this film. Putting on the fandom hat, I definitely expected and hoped for something different, and might need a second viewing to digest it all. Taking off the fandom hat, I can't deny the fact that aspiring big budget filmmakers and movie studios need to see this as an example of great storytelling, pacing, and a genuine care of the main characters--exactly how Disney wanted.",8,0,9,15 December 2017
Brave," Still not back to masterpiece form, but Pixar slightly redeems with Brave
","Cars 2 was the ultimate proof that Pixar is indeed mortal and capable of producing filth.Brave is proof that Pixar still has a ways to go before reaching its previous masterpiece status---the movie didn't even feel like it matched the title.But despite not having the emotional complexity of Up, the humor of Toy Story 2, or even the distinctive creativity of Monster's Inc., Brave still works in many levels and will entertain us all just like your usual Pixar fare. Like Pixar's best, there was a clear multitude of effort in terms of the storytelling, the voice acting, and especially its animation.Brave is about a feisty carefree princess that is absolutely not ready for a suitor, and not ready for the lifestyle of a queen. After a nasty spat with her mom, she sets off and makes a drastic decision leading to a difficult series of events. Without spoiling too much, Brave offers plenty of twists to the usual rebel-against-the-parents story that we see in kids movies.The outstanding part of this movie is the animation, which is leagues above anything else the competitors can weave. From the backgrounds to the action sequences to the subtle clever visual jokes to the staggering details concerning Princess Merida's hair, Brave looks spellbindingly gorgeous. The voice acting was also superb, as plenty of emotion was delivered by Kelly McDonald, Billy Connolly, and Emma Thompson.What will make this princess-driven movie stand out is Merida herself. She has quite a personality that in sharp contrast to princesses in animated and live-action ranging from Snow White to Princess Fiona in later Shrek films. She is funny, caring, adventurous, and far stronger emotionally and physically then what we are used to seeing on screen. The shameful part is that on the latter half we don't see her adventurous qualities---she barely uses her bow and arrow that had been sprinkled all over the marketing (which is definitely the worst part of Brave and most likely will hinder its box office receipts).As a matter of fact its the latter half that prevents this from being something truly magical and special. We don't see the Braveness in Brave, we don't see Merida as much action but more in a preparedness pose, and ultimately the climax wraps around a bit too quickly. The changing of directors definitely had a profound effect on the pacing and direction of the movie.Have no fear however, the little kids will definitely enjoy Brave. There is still enough humor, heart, and suspense to propel this past your usual computer animated drivel. And the Pixar fanatics will just be thrilled that its a turn back to originality after experiencing sequel after sequel---- -----And Cars 2.",8,2,4,22 June 2012
Guardians of the Galaxy," The Crazy Uncle of the Marvel Family, Guardians of the Galaxy is the comic book wild card that entertains from start to finish
","The Marvel enterprise has been practically saved by Disney as it's become more structured, more organized, more successful, and less prone to ill decisions since the buyout from the House of Mouse. Love or hate them, Disney knows how to draw up profits from any smaller company----just ask Pixar. And Guardians of the Galaxy is pretty much the assertion that the Marvel universe and comic book movies are here to stay as they took even one of the more obscure and pulp cult hit comics and transformed it into a big budget hearty fest of entertainment.Guardians of the Galaxy is a film that works but should not work because of the content and the heavy tongue-in-cheek humor, as well as containing a cast that hardly has the appeal of an Iron Man or a Captain America. For crying out loud, we have a regular joe, a tree, a raccoon, and a condensed version of the Hulk amongst the main characters. The comic book it's based on is meant to be a Scott Pilgrim type of cult hit that engages with a specific niche audience, but I assure you that it stands perfectly on par with the other Marvel films without overkilling itself.What mainly allows for newcomers and veterans to the franchise to warm up to the characters and the premise is the major focus on character development, fresh script, and also providing a beautiful blend of sci-fi action and rambunctious humor that dances along the PG-13/R line. Although the diehards were probably hoping for Disney to truly let this movie get unleashed, they should be satisfied with the fact that this movie is definitely the dirtiest, rowdiest, and most gutterball of the Marvel bunch. James Gunn holds very little back as we see plenty of dark humor sprinkled on nearly every scene.The outstanding cast also allows for the movie to flourish. Chris Pratt (Peter), Bradley Cooper (perfectly voicing Rocket), Zoe Saldana (Rising up the sci-fi queen ranks), Dave Bautista, and even Michael Rooker (small role, but steals the show as one of the antagonists) portray their characters perfectly without missing a beat and intertwine themselves with the heavy amount of special effects without any issues. The production value here is top-notch as we've come an extremely long way from 70s Superman.If there is something that Man of Steel (ugh.....) has proved, it's that special effects should not be the main hull but the icing of the cake. James Gunn does a fantastic job by giving everyone their moment to shine and allowing the audience to root for them. Unfortunately, Marvel still hasn't really given us a great villain outside the lines of Loki within the past decade, as we have several throwaway villains here that don't have much screen time or much personality either. Luckily the heroes and anti-heroes are far too much fun to watch to make up for the dullness coming from the evil side.Disney/Marvel has quietly revolutionized the film industry by providing us a yearly dosage of films that are connected heavily amongst each other by putting them in the same timeline. It almost makes for a required viewing of each Marvel film in order to be caught up and anticipate the next major blockbuster. So in other words as long as Marvel plans on using the dozens of heroes within its repertoire and maintain it in the same universe, they will not run out of movie ideas for at least a couple decades.Guardians of the Galaxy may have been a cult classic comic book with a quiet history. But thanks to a great script, great cast, and great direction and production value, this new franchise will fit and blend perfectly with Iron Man, Thor, Captain America, and whatever else Marvel decides (and is legally allowed) to throw in between Avengers movies.",8,2,4,1 August 2014
Shrek 2," Compared to the original Shrek, this is more than a disappointment
","From the beginning I knew it was going to be difficult to beat the original; which is one of the best animated movies I have ever seen. Just before Shrek 2 came out I was watching Shrek on NBC. I was watching when the Gingerbread Man was being tortured, when Robin Hood and his merry men were getting their butts beaten by Princes Fiona [In Matrix-style fashion], and also the classic ending, in which all the fairy tale creatures were dancing and jamming to 'I'm a Believer.' It was going to be tough to beat this one. It is pretty much like Shark Tales trying to come close to Finding Nemo's success [Which is pretty much an impossible task, especially after I saw the trailer for it].I see the critic's reviews of the movie, which were pretty much mixed. I saw the movie trailers, no help whatsoever. I checked the box-office numbers, and it obviously showed that Shrek 2 was anticipated by a lot of people; but then again, sometimes a lot of money does not mean a spectacular movie [Matrix Reloaded, Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle]. In the end, I went to see it with my mom and my two brothers. The end result was not good. I laughed more watching one episode of 'MarriedÂ…with Children.' Heck, I probably laughed even more listening to D12's 'My Band,' another one of Eminem's hip-hop satires. Shrek 2 made me laugh, do not get me wrong [hardly ever though], but it was nothing compared to the original Shrek.The plot is that Shrek and Fiona were invited to see Fiona's parents in Far Far Away, which have no idea who she married. Throughout the movie, you see that there was a plan for Fiona to actually marry Prince Charming, not Shrek. During the movie, the main conflict involves Shrek, Donkey, Fiona, The Fairy Godmother [Shocking], The King and Queen of Far Far Away, and also Puss In Boots, which is most likely the best character in the movie [I will explain later]. The plot has its twists and turns, which is why I will not explain the plot into more detail.Shrek 2 has only 2 funny characters, and one of them was funnier in the first one. Donkey, voiced by Eddie Murphy, was just annoying through the entire film, containing only a few smart lines and a few funny moments as a Stallion. Puss In Boots, voiced by Antonio Banderas, is the character that saved the movie. Fiona was not funny anymore, neither was Shrek, the Gingerbread Man, Pinocchio, and not even the Three Pigs were funny. As for Puss In Boots, he came up with a lot of smart lines, and funny moments that involves his animal instincts. Puss In Boots moans and complains in Spanish, fights with dignity, and also is cute when he wants to be. Puss In Boots also was caught on a fairy tale version of 'Cops', usually was seen competing with Donkey for becoming Shrek' best friend, and was even flirting around with women [Fiona was one of them]. The three blind mice had a lot more screen time the 2nd time around, and that did help a little bit.Shrek 2 had more music than the first one, but it was a lot worse. Shrek 2's songs includes the always-fun 'Funkytown', this one horrible song by Counting Crows, a few songs by the Fairy Grandmother [disgusting], and a very mediocre version of 'Livin' La Vida Loca'. The beginning of Shrek 2 was weaker, the ending was much weaker, the jokes were not as funny, it was not as emotionally moving, and had a lot less standout funny scenes than the original. Wait, as a matter of fact, there were NO standout funny scenes in Shrek 2.Shrek 2 also had a lot more cheap shots at Disney, since Shrek happens to be the 'anti-Disney.' Some of the jokes against Disney were okay, but others were just plain dreadful. This Disney-Dreamworks competition has got to stop, it is crazy, and the sad part is, Disney always wins. It happened with the Antz-Bug's Life contest [No contest, A Bug's Life creamed Antz], happened with the Shrek-Monster's Inc. competition, which resulted in Monsters, Inc. winning more money even though it lost the Oscar, and now we have the Finding Nemo-wannabe Shark Tales coming out this fall, which is totally going to flop [No pun intended]. Back to this movie. Shrek 2 had a lot more pop culture jokes, but some of them came off as stupid, while others did prevail [Example: Puss In Boots, being a orange cat, saying 'I hate Mondays.' Unless you have not heard of Garfield the Cat, you know what the joke is]. Just like the Matrix and Legally Blonde, they should have left Shrek without a sequel.In the end, it was a weak movie, especially compared to the original Academy-Award winning Shrek. It will be hard to win an Oscar the 2nd time around, especially with the upcoming animated movies 'The Incredibles' [Since when has Pixar failed us???] and also the underestimated 'Spongebob Squarepants: The Movie' [Well, this cartoon has won an Emmy before, so an Oscar does not look too bad]. Shrek 3 [Which is coming out eventually] better have smarter writing, less cheap jokes, and must try to bring the humor back to the main characters, otherwise, this franchise will lose a lot of fans. Will I see this again? No. Will I see Shrek 3? Maybe, as long as Puss In Boots comes back.Final Score: 4/10 [Originally, I gave it a 3 but I will give it a 4 for Antonio Bandera's standout performance.]",5,1,2,2 June 2004
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Review of Kill Bill Vol. 1 and 2
","One of the most acclaimed movies this decade is Kill Bill, Volumes 1 and 2. Both movies made over 60 million dollars each in the United States (over 330 million dollars worldwide in total) and has gotten so much praise one would wonder why is it that this doesn't have its own star in the Hollywood Walk of Fame yet. Directed by the unique and creative Quentin Tarantino, Kill Bill mixes bloody gory violence with a lot of beautiful imagery, excellent music, and a well-rounded cast of zany characters. Sounds great doesn't it? Well, Kill Bill Vol. 1 is a very good movie, but it is not as good as people say it is. As for Kill Bill Volume 2, now that is a spectacular movie. These two movies in actuality is one film, but for marketing purposes and because the finished product is so long, Miramax decides to release it as two separate films. Despite the rather slow start, Kill Bill finishes so strong you know why Tarantino is as popular as he is today.Kill Bill is about a woman, whose name is not revealed throughout most of the film (known as The Bride), looking for revenge after the gang of assassins she used to be with attacked her during a wedding rehearsal, killing every single person except for her. But before she goes after the man that started the massacre, she wants to get rid of the four people that were involved in the bloodbath first. Much easier said than done. The first Kill Bill basically is like an action flick, not concentrated too heavily on plot, but more on action. Kill Bill Vol. 2 does contain its amount of intense action, but also sinks deeper into the personalities of not just The Bride, but of the assassins, and Bill himself.The first part of Kill Bill is advertised as a massive action flick full of intense sequences of sword fighting and action. The truth is, there is only two massive action scenes, and both are good, don't get me wrong, but there is a lot of fluff in between the two action scenes. They range from several scenes of chatter, to an anime sequence, to a long sequence of The Bride trying to wiggle her toes. Talk about slow-paced. To add to that, it took 10-20 minutes before the final fight was finally set up. In other words, she was at the scene of the major fight, yet it took forever for the fight to begin. This first part of the movie would be much shorter if it was Robert Rodriguez editing the film.Tarantino also does this one-take shot that just can turn a potentially short moment into a very stretched and prolonged scene. And this happens twice. The movie is good, there is a good storyline, two jaw-dropping action scenes, good cast of characters(I fell in love with Gogo Yubari, and also the top assassin Elle Driver) and a shocking twist in the end, but overall I find Kill Bill Vol. 1 rather overrated. If there is one thing I love about the first part though, it has got to be the music, especially the credits theme and also the now famous theme to the hotel where the final battle takes place. Now enter part 2.Kill Bill Vol. 2 is everything Vol. 1 wanted to be. Volume 2 perfectly mixes suspense with action, humor, excellent music, brilliant acting, and a very good ending. Volume 2 basically fills all the holes Volume 1 created, and also answers all of the questions as to why the events took place and how The Bride became so skillful. Volume 2 concludes the entire ordeal, as the Bride has to deal with Budd, Elle, and of course, Bill, but gets a little more than what she bargained for. Elle Driver makes an even longer appearance the second time around, and Daryl Hannah (well-known as the mermaid in Splash) gives the best performance of the movie, as she portrays the ruthless, clever, unpredictable, and rage-filled rival assassin of The Bride. Her battle against the Bride stands in my opinion as one of the best fights within the past 10 years.The second half of the movie also has several flashbacks that helps weave the story together, and the flashback themselves were very entertaining and offered its share of foreshadowing. This was the pure filming brilliance that I was expecting from Tarantino. Very few flaws in the movie, and there never was a sense that the movie was dragging too long, and it is clocked in at over 10 minutes longer than the original, but it did not feel that way. There is not much more to say about the second part, except for the fact that it really picked up the slack and delivers one of the best movie experiences this decade. Kill Bill overall is a great film, overrated, but a superb film nonetheless. Not the best I have seen this decade, but has an entertainment value that is much higher than the usual films within the past few years. Kill Bill: packs a violent punch, a truly entertaining roller coaster.Kill Bill Vol. 1 = 7/10 Kill Bill Vol. 2 = 10/10 Kill Bill overall = 8/10",8,1,3,28 October 2005
The Hangover Part II," A raunchy, funny roller coaster you've already ridden before
","Select All. Cut. Open New Document. Paste. Thesaurus. Print. I can nearly guarantee you this was the process in writing the sequel to the most successful R-rated comedy of all-time. In one of the craziest and most blatant filmmaking moments of carbon copying an earlier installment I have ever witnessed Hangover II paces, moves, and delivers in the exact same method, style and speed as the original. The musical transitions are the same, some of the set-ups are the same, some of the conflicts and revelations were eerily alike and worst of all, the entire third act felt like the original----and they are thousands of miles from the United States. Every strength in this movie is deterred by the fact that Todd Phillips and company put no effort in trying to change things up a little aside from setting.Is the movie still funny? Yes, it is funny and there are indeed some standout moments. But, all the freshness and originality of the first Hangover is definitely not present here, and it hurts more because they could have fixed some of the setbacks of the original. This time Stu (Ed Helms) is getting married in Thailand in order to gain approval from his fiancée's father. During a night of drinking with the 'Wolfpack' (Bradley Cooper, Zack Galifianakis, Justin Bartha) and the fiancée's brother, something went wrong, and the crew is many miles away in Bangkok. And of course, one of them is missing. And of course, they don't remember anything. And of course, they are mixed up in multiple situations occurring within the city. The difference between this one and their stint in Vegas is that the stakes are much higher, as the adventure in Thailand is much more grim and dark than in Sin City. Hangover part one was hilarious, unique, and had flair of comedic originality. However, it needed a few polishes in order to become a true comedic classic. Zach as Allen is the biggest of the flaws. His characterization in the original was very uneven, too random, and just didn't deliver as much sympathy as the other characters. In the sequel, he is ruder, crueler, and an absolute pain to witness. In the original his actions are mildly justified because of his stupidity. Here however the stupid act gets old extremely fast. It doesn't help that Galifianakis doesn't have the comedic timing that superior funnymen possess. The rest of the cast throughout the movie was great, with Ed Helms and Ken Jeong being the best examples. Todd Phillips should have known better, as he is a good director with a nice track record. I am extremely disappointed that instead of taking an approach to trying something new while still offering the same type of R-rated college humor, he chose to stick to the formula far too close. You can copy some of the jokes and get away with it, but to imitate the entire three-act structure of the original Hangover is nothing more than lazy and uninspired filmmaking. He still has a few tricks up his sleeve with a few raunchy and hilarious surprises, but far too much potential was wasted in order for me to forgive him. Bottom Line: You will most likely have a good time watching this if you enjoyed the original. That being said, it will feel exactly like the original---except it's in Bangkok and the setting is much darker. They cranked the ante in conflict, but failed to improve anything or change anything from the 2009 comedy smash hit. Playing it safe hindered this movie, as part of Hangover's appeal was its inability to stick to a formula. Hangover II is funny, but lacks the satisfaction, zaniness, and appeal of the original. Hopefully they can spice things up for the third installment (you know it's coming out, stop lying to yourself) otherwise all I have to do is copy this review and paste it to the third chapter. diac1987.blogspot.com Entire Planet Observed on Daily Basis",6,209,309,26 May 2011
Logan," An extremely impressive wrap-up to the Wolverine trilogy, Logan is leagues above the other X-Men films
","Logan might become the first film to truly force the Academy to rethink its opinion on comic book films since 2008, when The Dark Knight forced the committee to expand its Best Picture yearly lineup. Yes, it is that good. And yes, it's the best superhero film in nearly two decades. Yes, I am pitting this above The Dark Knight. Stop shaking your head.What is a masterful blend of action, drama, and comic book flair, Logan is perfectly executed from beginning to end even though it will tear your heart apart as if Wolverine himself is coming at you in the midst of his infamous berserker rage. Even if you secretly and calmly knew the results of this film, considering that Jackman won't be reprising his role and considering the obviously bleak tone, you still won't be ready for the heartbreak. This dramatic style of comic book cinema is what DC has never fully been able to pull off (especially recently, I'm looking at you Batman vs. Superman) and Disney's Marvel has always refused to aim towards (Because Disney enjoys Marvel following the Pixar formula). It is a fitting end and an excellent finale to a rather clunky spin-off trilogy that is embedded amongst a plethora of other films.I don't use the term Oscar-worthy very often, especially in the comic book realm. However from the cinematography to the acting many elements of Logan deserves extra praise and an abundance of attention. We can start with James Mangold, whose writing and directing skills here have hit peak momentum. With an interestingly diverse career that spans from Kate and Leopold to Walk the Line to Knight and Day (huh?), Mangold and friends concoct a deep script that remains very much grounded even if the concept involves X-Men and superheroes. In here we see a much older and dying Wolverine and Professor X trying to help a young mutant reach the northern border for safety before the evil company that created her catch up and grab her. The emotions of a difficult life are explored far more than the whimsical events that usually follow comic books that we've read over the years. From the music to the cinematography, every element of Logan points to presenting a story that forces you to reflect on a life you've lived.Hugh Jackman and Patrick Stewart have always been the best parts of the entire Fox X-Men franchise (which has more mediocre films than good, I must add), and seeing them working together here in such a dramatic picture continues to showcase their range and phenomenal talent. As Logan and Charles as opposed to Wolverine and Professor X, we see them stripped down of their power and youth and witness a severely condensed version of what they used to be. It hurts to watch, but we maintain engaged and begging for them to just survive the day. They both deserve some Oscar buzz, I am deathly serious. And serious extra points to Stephen Merchant and newbie Dafne Keen for their remarkable performances. The cast was overwhelmingly stellar and made the film tougher to witness as the stakes are raised and you know death is imminent.I avoided this movie longer than I should have not because I was afraid of DC-like disappointment, but more because I knew it was the end of an era of films I grew up with, and I knew deep down that it was going to be a difficult watch. Much like us (most of us) as we grow older, the X-Men films have indeed matured, especially in the Wolverine timeline. Logan is nonetheless entertaining indeed, with the dizzying violent action and impressive visuals that compliments a story that feels like a grim western. The production value was top-notch, considering the smaller budget (for a film of its caliber and genre anyway) and considering the fact that the comic book visuals were mostly taking a backseat while allowing the story to organically grow and advance.It doesn't feel like a comic book movie because it hits so close to home. Logan is a punch to the gut, but a mesmerizing film that is hands-down among the all-time best of the genre. Whether you enjoy comic book movies or not, this is required viewing.Blog: https://coffeeandscriptblog.wordpress.com/",10,2,7,17 April 2017
Avengers: Age of Ultron," The train of joy coming from the MCU continues to deliver, but its starting to run out of steam
","I'd hate to spoil the party, but the Marvel Cinematic Universe is starting to run out of trick cards.Criticizing Avengers: Age of Ultron is the equivalent of being one of those prick judges on Cutthroat Kitchen, insulting a cook for making a mediocre pasta when all they had was marinara sauce and expired noodles. Joss Whedon and friends pulled out all the necessary mayhem, entertainment, and joy of your usual MCU flick, so let's mention this before this turns into a massive review of disappointment. However it's becoming a bit more apparent that the intangibles holding back Marvel and Disney's potential is hindering the quality of the movies. It hurts to point out the elephant in the room, but after seeing the final scene you can't help but realize that clearly Hollywood and the Copyright shenanigans is hampering the franchise as a whole.For those not truly knowledgeable of the subject, Marvel and Disney are restricted on who they can show (and for how long) and who can get their own spin-off movie. As of now, the true-true Avengers team assembling on screen is literally impossible. Fox, Sony, and Universal own cinematic Marvel properties and unless every film studio in California decide to drop the competition and hold hands, Whedon will be restricted on his vision of the Avengers and the current Marvel universe. He even has to change the origin stories of some of the characters because certain words can't even be used in this franchise of movies. Like a production version of mineweeper, you can avoid mines for only so long before you notice you're running out of space.The production value, writing, acting, humor, action, and attention to each of the characters has been spot-on lately, and Avengers: Age of Ultron is no exception. All the characters are back, and they remain just as entertaining and engaging as the original Avengers movie that overwhelmed audiences back in 2012. Iron Man and Hawkeye have all the great lines, Hulk and Thor has all the awesome kinetic energy, and Captain America remains our lovable heroic leader. Of course, a few other characters make nice cameo appearances, and others...well, we didn't really need them (one hero in particular was bizarrely underwhelming). Lastly, Ultron was quite a formidable foe, perfectly portrayed by James Spader.But.....There are no stakes to be raised. We all know the upcoming Marvel lineup for the next several years. We all know of their limited amount of cinematic resources. So with that we are presented with less surprises, less suspense, and less of the unpredictability factor that had been a major source of fun during the first phase of Marvel movies. The movie took off immediately without any sort of build-up because it knows why we are there: entertainment of the highest summer degree. But with sequel after sequel planned, the audience pretty much knows who is going to make it. What would keep us engaged would be if we saw any major left field surprises or unexpected turns. Because of the restrictions and because of the required schedule, there honestly was very little to be shocked at. It didn't have the ballsy shakeup of The Winter Soldier.No movie built to predate upcoming chapters has ever felt complete (Dead Man's Chest anyone?). Avengers: Age of Ultron tries its best to disguise this but the inevitable is clear: punches were held back because they need to be saved for later installments. Marvel has to keep whatever remaining limited cards it has on its deck. Unlike DC which pretty much has all its eggs on the same basket, Marvel has to make incredible omelets using less eggs. And although you will enjoy this satisfying meal of comic book action, you'll notice the kitchen staff starting to sweat.",7,2,6,30 April 2015
Hotel Transylvania," Light joyful fun, Hotel Transylvania is a shockingly good time for all
","From the outside, Hotel Transylvania may look like a clichéd and typical aim-at-the-kids-mooch-off-the-adults animated film with pop music, celebrities, cute characters, and plenty of childish humor. It may look like a film that doesn't strive for the heights of Pixar and instead aims for the likes of Dreamworks' lesser efforts. And from a film buff's perspective, it may look like an animated movie with known production hell that was tossed at September to just collect some cash and lessen the losses.But, Hotel Transylvania actually delivers. Surprisingly, and in many departments. It did not just succeed in pleasing the kids, but it actually entertains the adults with quick zany Tex Avery humor with very minimal downtime. Similar to the original Madagascar flick that remains DreamWorks' most consistently entertaining franchise, this movie rapidly fires jokes high, low, and direct to catch the kids, teenagers, and adults off-guard. They took the classic father/growing daughter concept and gave it a clever monster twist that allows for plenty of creativity.And if there is a man that can handle potential creativity, it's the incredibly underrated director Genndy Tartakovsky. Tartakovsky was behind such cartoon gems like Dexter's Laboratory, Powerpuff Girls, the original Clone Wars, and of course, Samurai Jack. He knows how to time jokes, how to time emotion, and knows when his product might be overstaying its welcome. This movie clocks in at a mere 91 minutes, so the movie never feels like its dragging. The script went through so many changes, but they hired the right guy to help mold it into a good backdrop to all the visual humor that dominates the source of all the laughter you'll experience.As previously stated, the overbearing father conflict is supported by an original concept so it never feels like previously charted waters. But let's also hand it to the voice cast for not hamming up the script. Adam Sandler isn't exactly the most prolific actor for doing accents, but with his Sandler touch and knowledge of when to cut back on his material makes for a surprisingly good performance. Partnering up once again is Adam Samberg, and those two work off each other quite well in an Abbot and Costello manner. Rounding out the fun cast is Devid Space, Steve Buscemi, Kevin James, Jon Lovitz, Selena Gomez, and the hilarious Luenell in a limited role.Bottom Line: Hotel Transylvania isn't deep and doesn't carry any cinematic weight, but is indeed a very enjoyable film with plenty of surprises, humor, and even a good bit of heart. It's perfect for kids with the fun cast of characters and silly jokes while it's perfect for adults because it is short, clean-cut, and also has some great adult humor to boot. Tartakovsky took a doomed project and injected plenty of life to it with his brand of humor and his ability to pack plenty of rich content into a limited about of time. Don't let the look or reputation of the studio fool you, this movie packs a light delightful punch.",8,4,8,7 February 2013
Big Fish," The beautiful Southern Belle in Burton's entourage of films
","Tim Burton in recent years has dwelled into a very familiar look, a familiar style, and to an extent a familiar cast of actors and actresses that continuously follow the man's career. But in the midst of this consistent approach to directing films in the past decade is a movie so magical, so majestic and so unlike Burton you can hardly believe it was him behind the camera. That's because Big Fish is the most emotionally-driven tale he's ever done, and this requires quite a different tactic. Big Fish is his Schindler's List, a movie that emotionally touches home to not only the viewer but to the director making it.Big Fish is about a wrecked father-son relationship that tries to heal before the father passes away. But the father continues to reveal himself through tall tale stories that blend tons of fiction with plenty of reality—although the son is determined to figure out the truth behind all the life stories. Based on a late 90s novel by Daniel Wallace, this movie follows the life of the father (and all his crazy moments) leading up to the present with him inches from death.Argue what you will about Burton's look, his selection of actors has always been superb and it's no different here. From the young Billy Crudup and Ewan McGregor running the show to great smaller performances by Jessica Lange, Helena Bothman Carter and Albert Finney we have ourselves a great cast representing a great group of characters we can easily grow to love and associate with.While Burton has divulged into the typical dark Gothic look with dark gloomy backgrounds and dark gloomy material, Big Fish's Southern Gothic roots demanded a different look. And this is where Burton excels in more ways than one. The visual effects blended with the story quite well, the imagery was a beautiful mix of warm, dark, and downright colorful, and the cinematography made Alabama shine beautifully in ways that not even Forrest Gump could achieve.Beautiful is the best way to describe Big Fish; from the writing to the acting to the overall look and feel. It tackled the father-son dynamic extremely well, flowed peacefully without ever feeling boring, and kept your interests and emotional investments nice and high up until the very end.While overall this will never go down as his most popular or more iconic movie, I can and will safely say that this is one of his best films and easily his best directing performance he's ever going to deliver.And unless he can learn to expand his directing horizons, this will remain true.",9,1,1,15 May 2012
The Dark Knight," Good? Yes. Great? Yea. Amazingly perfect in every possible way on an epic scale of perfection? No.
","I have the flame suit on. I've already called my lawyers. I've prepared fake passports and bought several different aliases to run by. I have also transferred my funds to a European account. Why so serious? Because, here we go, The Dark Knight is not the epic piece of Godly art that everyone is hyping it to be.*Runs* The Dark Knight is a good piece of work, a decent movie, but does not fall into near-perfection by any means. Despite the amazing performances, writing, and action sequences, the heart and core of the comic book flavor is severely missing. Issues from Batman Begins is carried over and repeated here, even though they aren't as easy to spot. This is much better than Begins, but still fails to totally erase the memory of Burton's vision of Batman. Resembling more The Godfather and Heat rather than a flick like Iron Man or Spider-Man, it's a totally different sort of movie involving superheroes and supervillians. Gotham City STILL doesn't truly look like Gotham City.Starting the movie is a bank robbery unlike any other, setting the tone of the movie instantly. We see the Joker (Heath Ledger) stirring some early trouble with the mob and crime lords. We then see Batman imitators lurking about. Last, but not least, we see Bruce Wayne's ex (Maggie Gyllenhaal) around the arms of another man: Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart). Then running amok throughout the 150+ minutes of The Dark Knight are action sequences, plot twists, several surprises, several close calls, and a whole lot of crime drama. Good vs. Evil is a battle that is horrifically blurred, and human nature surrounding Gotham City is being tested. All the tension is overcoming Bruce Wayne and Batman, and he begins questioning his motives and placement within the city. The writing staff threw in plenty of deep and engaging dialogue amongst all the action we see on-screen. It's a Batman fan's dream come true; or is it? We can start by crediting Heath Ledger for a fine performance as the Joker. But if Ledger deserves an Oscar for his role, so should Nicholson back in 1989, because believe there are many similarities in terms of performance. The Joker here is cynical, merciless, and is bent on anarchy for no reasonbut so was Joker in 1989. If Ledger wins the Oscar, then Jack himself should be accepting it on his behalf. Christian Bale yet again fails as Batman with his frustrating raspy voice. As Bruce Wayne he nails it, but as Batman he still needs a bit of work. When Batman starts monologing, it's hard not to cringe. The rest of the cast does a good job, most notably Gary Oldman as Lt. Gordon. Let's also not forget Morgan Freedman, Michael Caine, Aaron Eckhart, and Maggie Gyllenhaal.The biggest strength of the Batman universe lies within the balance of Batman and his villains. Almost all of them have some sort of connection with our hero. However, the treatment of villains yet again is disappointing, as we see a few villains limited to mere cameos, and the Joker himself (despite the trailers) does not get as much screen time as you may assume. In the infamous 1989 version, we saw the Joker rise from lowly punk criminal to a serious threat to the entire city. In the Dark Knight, unlike Batman, there is literally no explanation as to why he is the way he is. There is no backstory revealed, nothing that could possibly explain his physical appearance and mental state. Surely he may craft some tales, but why believe a madman's tale as he wields a knife to your lips? Dark Knight's best moments were not the action sequences, but the immense tension and suspense predating the payoff .Rarely could you predict the outcomes of some of the conflicts, and for the most part all the payoffs were grand, sometimes leading to applause. The chases and action-packed moments themselves were also well-crafted and made great use of special effects. Yet with so many problems flying at you at the same time, it's impossible to expect them all to be concluded and wrapped up in the end. Nolan's direction is stunning from time to time, but then he runs out of steam towards the end of the third act, when the movie is almost finished. The ending, albeit unexpected, was a bit underwhelming and quite vague, especially considering the fact that The Dark Knight is 150 minutes long.Bottom Line: The negativity is sprinkled about in this review, but don't let that fool you. The Dark Knight is indeed a great blockbuster flick that will have you forgetting that there's popcorn and soda by your side. From the dazzling performance of the late Heath Ledger to the carefully-constructed action sequences that keep the pace flowing, there is plenty to praise about. That being said, it's still not the best superhero movie of all-time. Batman is a comic book, and the cast of this new franchise must remember this. You can dwell as much realism as you'd like, but the fact remains that this isn't a realistic franchise nor should it ever be treated as such.Gotham City is still missing its gritty, Gothic, dark architecture and style of Burton's films, and needs more emphasis on the villains that are in Batman's world. The villains are the 'yang' to the Batman mythology, and Batman himself is the 'yin'; you can't have too much of one and not enough of the other. While it isn't Batman and Robin or Fantastic Four (both of them) The Dark Knight still falls short of masterpiece quality simply because of its exchange of comic book style for realistic crime drama. The Dark Knight is a great ride, but not an epic one to Quality Heaven.",8,19,38,20 July 2008
Into the Wild," Like life itself, Into the Wild is a wild and beautiful flower with some nasty thorns attached
","The best stories are those that even the greatest novelists couldn't make up. Real life, the real world creates some incredible adventures led by incredible characters. In this film, we follow one of the most amazing true stories ever captured on film. Into the Wild is a very deep and engaging one-man trip through the unknown portions of the United States. Based off the best-seller written by John Krakauer, Into the Wild is about a man that gives up all his material possessions and life altogether in search of purpose, in search of happiness, and in search of a direction to head towards in his life. Written and directed by Sean Penn with a lot of love and detail, this movie is beautifully shot, beautifully edited, and even though the third act drags quite a bit, you'll remain hooked on Christopher McCandless' travels up until the bitter end. In case you had not read the startling true story, Christopher McCandless was a very gifted athlete and student with high marks and an extremely bright future. But, spiritually, he was extremely lost; emotionally, he was empty. Upon this, he donates all his money to charity and runs away from his family, his college, everything he had worked for. Now, whatever your stance is on his decision-making, we can all agree he was clearly a man that was lost, and needed to be found. You can be unhappy for only so long before you decide to do something drastic. Some move to another city, some pursue a new career, some search for love. In his case, he chose to become one with nature. Like I said, you can question his common sense and decisions, but don't question his desire for something more. Sean Penn and John Krakeuer clearly admired the emotional strength and bravery of our main character, as they infused his story with a lot of love, a lot of content, and a lot of overall emotion.The main core and best element in this film is the overall acting. While not one performance stood out, everyone did an exceptional job. Emile Hirsch does a spectacular job portraying a strong-willed yet spiritually lost man hellbent on achieving true happiness. The smaller roles (people Christopher meets during his journey) added charm to the overall flick, including Vince Vaughn, Kristen Stewart, Hal Halbrook, and Catherine Keener. The writing supported the acting, as not one line sounds forced or shoved upon, and it adds an added layer of realism to the already-true story. The directing however is a bit of a mixed bag. Sean Penn really loved this story and definitely displayed it with the elongated running time, insistence on shooting every scene on location, and the artsy final moments; but sometimes the French-style directing was a bit too much. There are instances in which the characters look at the camera and make faces or pose, and that totally breaks down the fourth wall and throws you away from the main structure of the film. You realize it's a movie and not a story when the main character glares at the camera for a few split seconds. Then the final act, when the climax drags, hinders the overall quality of the movie. Approximately ten minutes could have been cut from the last third and it would have been fine. Finally, we have the controversial element of morality. Sometimes, moral codes amongst each of us prevent us from sympathizing with the main character, leading to some issues. A recent example is Sex and the City's first movie's final act, which results in us totally losing sympathy for the main four (with the exception of one, but avoiding spoilers). Into the Wild also suffers from this. While we can clearly understand and see the frustrations of Christopher against the world we live in, his actions are heavily on the selfish side, despite what he's gone through. Instead of seeing a man that has suffered through the childhood and teenage years and needed to escape everything, we see a person so closed-minded on his journey that he shuts off all the people that cared about him throughout his trip. All the offers of help he received, and he practically shuns them all (especially the final human encounter, in an especially gut-wrenching scene). Upon seeing this, the viewer knows how he is going to end up. And whether or not you'll feel sorry for him is entirely up to you, the witness to all his decisions.Bottom Line: Enjoy the journey, even if the destination and bumps on the road is going to create some discussions and disagreeing points. Into the Wild is a wonderful film that is beautifully shot, despite the direction being misguided at some instances. Once you get past the questionable directing though, prepare for a visually stimulating trip chronicling the adventures of a man on a self-discovery expedition like nothing else seen before on film. While this movie will not convince you to do what he did, it will lead you to questions concerning fulfillment, love, faith, and happiness. Into the Wild is about a journey in search of answers, and despite it being a beautifully flawed (mildly) flick, it does lead to more questions. Great movie to emotionally digest, just do it slowly.P.S. Where on earth is Eddie Vedder's Oscar for his musical contribution?",8,6,9,5 June 2010
Annie Hall," Classic? I think not.
","Back in 1977 Star Wars was conquering the entire world. Amassing box office numbers never before even imagined, Star Wars was truly becoming a massive part of American culture very, very quickly. With brilliant writing, casting, direction, and also a good dose of fun, Star Wars is hands-down one of the top movies of all time. It was expected to sweep the Oscars that year. But, the film would be overshadowed at the Oscars by the quiet film Annie Hall. Annie Hall put Woody Allen on the map and made him a star. The film would also launch the career of Diane Keaton. Using a very unique form of storytelling that would become perfected by Quinten Tarantino, Annie Hall is totally not the average love story, for many many reasons.But, just because of it being a different kind of film, it does not make it any more entertaining. Annie Hall is charming, it does have a few laughs, but it is nowhere near the greatest film of all time. It is not worthy of the Best Picture Oscar, nor is it worthy of being listed as a true classic. Instead, the film should just be accepted as one of the more groundbreaking filming achievements of the 1970s, and nothing more. Woody Allen's one-joke film (the entire film focuses around the bizarre personality of the main character) clocks in at a decent amount of time and offers a realistic bittersweet ending, but seems to lack that punch that truly makes it a standout film.The story revolves around a very nervous and neurotic comedian by the name of Alvy Singer who falls in love with this interesting and pretty singer Annie Hall. Throughout the film, you see the ups and downs of the relationships, and also get glimpses into the pasts of both people in order to get an idea as to why they are the way they are, and why they have so much chemistry together. The best part of this movie is the chemistry Allen and Keaton have. When they are together, you can sense the love and care thy have for each other. Both performances were excellent; they truly were the ones carrying the film. Everyone else in the film really carried no weight and are totally forgettable characters, besides Christopher Walken's character, which shared a very funny moment with Woody Allen.Annie Hall denies the fact that there is a fourth wall, as the film has the main character talking to the audience. This is not the only bizarre element of the film. The movie has many things that prior to being released, had not been witnessed before, which included the thoughts of two people talking to each other as they engaged in conversation, also has tons of flashbacks and moments in which the main characters interact with their past counterparts. All these little unique moments throughout the movie make this movie very fresh, very different from the average romantic comedy. While these little things do enhance the experience a little, it fails to save the movie from at times being a bit boring or a bit tedious. There is just way too much time in between laughs.The humor is at times a bit dry, which could be another reason why it appealed to so many but did not appeal much to me. I personally thought Napoleon Dynamite was the worst comedy within the past three decades. Annie Hall is no Napoleon Dynamite mind you, but it still lacks that edge that the better romantic comedies contain, comedies like The 40-year-Old Virgin, When Harry Met Sally, Pretty Woman, and There's Something About Mary.Bottom Line: Annie Hall is not worthy of having that Best Picture Oscar; it should have gone to Star Wars for sure. I have never found Woody Allen that funny, and I did not really see what was the big deal about this film. It is just an average, mediocre love story told in a very unique way. While paving the way for interesting movie making from Robert Rodriguez, Quinten Tarantino, and others, Annie Hall is an experimental film that appeals to some, while failing to appeal to others. This is not the romantic comedy classic that everyone makes it out to be. Annie Hall: superb performances barred by many slow and dull moments and boring situations, not a classic in my standards.Score: 4/10",4,24,48,18 December 2005
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," Erasing memories of a loved one: eternal sunshine, or a black hole sun?
","Who you are is shaped from what you've seen, what you've experienced, what you've felt, and what you've learned; getting rid of any portion of the past diminishes a part of you, it strips away a piece of you. Gondry's film Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind explores love in a different way; what happens when its over, and you want to move on by destroying what had happened before. Can somebody continue living life after forgetting events that had occurred to him or her years ago? This concept is very unique, quite bizarre, but is handled so perfectly it speaks to the soul, becomes food for thought, and is a blessing disguised in 108 minutes of deep, insightful popcorn entertainment. Flawlessly written by Kaufman and Gondry, wonderfully acted by Carrey and Winslet, and beautifully directed by Gondry, Eternal Sunshine is a bittersweet movie that should bring out tears of joy and despair in anyone that has been through the highs and lows of love.Eternal Sunshine follows a quiet, tightly wounded, almost emotionless man by the name of Joel (Jim Carrey) whom just learned that his ex-girlfriend, the carefree, impulsive, unpredictable, and needy Clementine (Kate Winslet) erased him from her memory using a special procedure. In retaliation, Joel attempts to undergo the same procedure, to destroy any living evidence of a relationship. However, as the procedure is underway and Joel is running around through the memories inside his head, he realizes just how much he still loves her and how empty he would become if the woman that turned his life around suddenly vanishes. In his mind he races to save any shred of memory of Clementine, despite the doctors successfully dismantling his mind at the same time. In the meantime, not all is well amongst the people involved with the procedure, as the memory-erasing business impacted their morals, their beliefs about love, and their sympathy towards people in general.The movie is displayed in a very unstructured manner, which pretty much represents the hostile timeframe of recollections. Eternal Sunshine is displayed in a totally non-linear format, and repeatedly jumps settings with little or no warning whatsoever. That aspect alone requires multiple viewings of this film just to see how genius the directing and editing really is. The writing staff delivers one of the most original love tales in recent memory (pun intended), as they craft a deep story about a bond between two people that love and need each other, whether they know it or not. Every line, every bit of dialogue is important and strengthens the belief that Joel and Clementine were meant for each other.Complimenting the writing is the excellent direction of Goundry. While the visual effects were stunning, the story propels the movie instead of the imagery, which is a rarity. Goundry doesn't just film, he films and then edits severely using a montage of colors, blurs, textures, angles, and also alternates with different speeds throughout the entire movie to set the tone and mood of the moment. His music videos aren't as great as critics claim (Personally, Spike Jonze destroys him) but all his usual music video techniques shine brilliantly in this film. Clever editing (that should have at least gotten an Oscar nod) helps display the chaos towards the climax in the movie.Finally however, we have to give a special congratulations to Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet for providing yet another great performance as the main couple in the movie. You saw them at their happiest, their saddest, their angriest, and at their most caring. Both actors have a nice range of roles in their resume, but ranking high up there in terms of performances are the ones here. Supporting cast is very good too, especially by that of Kirsten Dunst as the adorable employee of the morally questionable company behind the memory-erasing procedure.For being a sci-fi movie, this plays off as incredibly believable, partly because it never goes over-the-top. The erasing process was never dwelled upon nor was it totally explained as to how it works and how its possible, but raises a lot of moral questions long after the movie is over. How much would someone change after taking away a special person from their life? Even when the sun settles and it's all over, can the love still remain? Can the love still be there? Eternal Sunshine raises so many questions and leaves so much room for discussion, that it can become an event in itself to discuss the movie after watching it.Bottom Line: With excellent acting, directing, editing, and visuals backing a unique yet engrossing story about love, memories, and all the hardships and happiness it brings, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is easily one of the best films of 2004. While the concept and the presentation of the movie may distract and even drive away the avid moviegoer, underneath the complexities of some of the scenes lies a very basic theme about moving on: You can move on, try to forget, but the love for that person remains, forever and always, and so will the memories, whether you like it or not. Just watch it, whether you are alone, with somebody, or more than one person (in which case, shame on you). But can a spotless mind be a happy mind? Not sure but a spotless film like this one is hard to catch, so whenever you have the chance to see it, take it.",10,0,3,16 July 2007
Taken," Of all the women we kidnap, we happen to nab the one with a deadly spy as a father....just our luck...
","Remember that time period when Hollywood used to release incredible action/thriller movies in an orderly pace? Neither do I. What used to be a great trend to participate in back in the 90s (Terminator 2, Speed, Face-Off, The Rock, Con Air, Die Hard: With a Vengeance, Jurassic Park, The Mummy, The Matrix, Bad Boys, Under Siege, True Lies, Desperado, Clear and Present Danger, The Hunt for Red October, Patriot Games, Saving Private Ryan, Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction) suddenly became a distant memory, as the 2000s served very few decent Hollywood thrillers. Instead, we have to head overseas to find them. The 2000s consisted of many surprise-surprise excellent European actioneers with Hot Fuzz, Run Lola Run, Transporter, Kiss of the Dragon, Unleashed, and this superb flick. What happens nowadays is that Hollywood is scaling back its amount of action in order to make the extra money. In the first paragraph, 15 of the 19 movies I mentioned from the 90s were rated-R. In other words, they did not care about the PG-13 rating. Now, nearly every action movie must hit the PG-13 barrier. Even the fourth Die Hard was edited to not reach rated-R (which was a Die Hard staple). To add to that movies from overseas (like this one) become edited in the States in order to hit the weaker and friendlier PG-13. But don't let that stop you. Taken is one of the most vicious PG-13 movies you'll ever see, and you'll enjoy every minute of its inability to cut back on the gruesomeness. It sounds barbaric, I know, but if you truly want to see what good action used to look like from the studios of Tinseltown, look no further than this excellent effort. Luc Besson and his talented filming crew provide yet another gripping story to sink your teeth into. This time it's about a retired spy (Liam Neeson) who searches all of Europe in order to find his kidnapped daughter (Maggie Grace). He is given a small time frame, since his daughter is about to be sold into the deep, disgusting, and grueling underworld of sex trafficking. The movie starts off with Bryan, the spy, trying to adjust to a life without espionage, and the rest is just a wild roller coaster ride containing plentiful action scenes and fight after fight. Written by Besson and Robert Mark Kamen, Taken provides a healthy dosage of father-daughter sentimentality as well as provide an insight into a dangerous illegal world not seen often in movies. But it's not just the delightful taste of gunfire, fights, and chases that maintains the entertainment in Taken. Liam Neeson does an excellent job portraying the retired spy. While there are indeed great action stars, very few of them are excellent actors as well. Liam Neeson can proudly say he fits both billings, as his version of a spy is just as cold and calculating as even Daniel Craig's James Bond. Most amazing fact is that he is over 55 years of age. While Jason Bourne remains the most lethal of all the movie character spies in the last decade, Bryan isn't too far behind. While everyone else in the movie delivers decent performances, it's Neeson that runs and carries the show with a mix of emotion, determination, and rage. Pierre Morel directs this movie well, by keeping the action within a decent view, maintaining good pacing, and also allowing for the actors to breathe out a scene when more emotion is involved. The fights themselves are brutal, and not held back in the least bit. You will feel every blow, you will chuckle at every clever maneuver and trick, and sometimes even jump in surprise as to what's happening. The movie is quite cold, as sometimes you'll forget that Bryan is the good guy, especially in moments where innocent people are within the crosshairs. Like Jason Bourne in The Bourne Supremacy, it's at times difficult to root for Neeson when he involves people that well.aren't really involved. But that feeling is quickly vanquished when you see him waste the next sap that is part of the sex trafficking ring. Bottom Line: This movie proves multiple things: Neeson can be an action star at a relatively old age, Europe is suddenly a rising force in the action/thriller genre, and also that you don't need fancy CGI or special effects to craft a good movie that will also lead to good money. Taken quietly emerged as the top action film of 2009, and becomes another great film with Luc Besson's stamp on it (The Fifth Element, Unleashed, Transporter, Nikita, Leon). The movie has the trills and the tension, but also has the heart that is sorely missing in most mainstream action films. You will cheer this movie on as it delivers with a great storyline, great acting, and just an overall satisfying cinematic package. Did I already mention that Liam Neeson is 57 years old?",9,14,21,1 February 2010
Alice in Wonderland," The characters in the movie were right, this isn't the real Alice..
","Whenever there is a dark or whimsical movie script floating around Hollywood, you know that Tim Burton is close behind. Then we have Disney tapping into the Hot Topic-like culture that hit full blast with Nightmare Before Christmas. Place the two together and we have a high-budget version of Alice in Wonderland, one of the most whimsical yet essentially pointless pieces of literature this side of Shakespeare. While Disney has dabbed with the story before back in 1951, it was met with massive criticism from major fans of the book. Nonetheless (and rather ironically) that version is not only the best one, but is easily the most well-known. To add some oomph to the accomplishment, there are at least 15 versions of the book that had been released at one point or another.Which brings us to the biggest issue of the 2010 Alice in Wonderland: it has some major shoes to fill. If imitating Walt Disney's majesty with animation back in the day was so easy, we would have much heavier competition against Pixar. The 1951 version may not be 100% accurate, but it has a lot of classic scenes, a lot of classic characters, and has the crazy random tone of the book. Tim Burton, using a script that mixes both Alice books and provides us with a version that has a bit more adventure, a bit more peril, but at the same time makes little references to Disney's previous version.Sadly though, it doesn't have the whimsical majestical tone and mood of the book. While the special effects were nice, the acting was good and the music was Danny Elfmanny, this Alice is a pretty picture painted on an empty canvas. The movie won't test your imagination, it doesn't really provide as much laughter and insanity as it should, and towards the end it becomes a retread of nearly every single fantasy flick within the last decade. Why there is a battle that resembles that of Narnia, I'll never know. This isn't the Alice we know. It may look like Alice, it may behave like Alice, but it still just isn't Alice. It is more accurate in content than the other Alices, but it isn't more accurate in tone.We know the tale, and this movie takes most of the events from the two books and mixes them together into one grand adventure. However the events happening before entering the rabbit hole is much more extensive than usual. We see Alice (Mia Wasikowska) pretty much getting forced to be married when clearly she isn't ready. Upon running away at the altar, she follows the white rabbit and we all know where it goes from there. A major plot difference though is that the characters in Wonderland constantly believe that she isn't the real Alice for one reason or another. Along the way she meets up with talking flowers, a smoking caterpillar (Alan Rickman), a mean queen (Helena Bonham Carter), the Mad Hatter (Johnny Depp) among others.Let's at least praise a few things before thrashing the movie into disappointment level. The acting is superb, especially that of Anne Hathaway believe it or not. Johnny Depp is always deep into the role he plays, but unlike other works (Edward Scissorhands, Pirates of the Caribbean, Ed Wood) he isn't given much material to work with. Helena Bonham Carter is a hoot as the Red Queen. As for our Alice, Mia Wasikowska looks the part and plays the part well. The special effects, while they surprisingly weren't utilized that much for setting, definitely enhanced the visual experience. The Cheshire cat is one example of an improvement over the 1951 version.And now, the criticism. Alice in Wonderland starts off decently, but once she enters the world of Wonderland, its one that isn't full of curious characters and circumstances, but instead is a dangerous world that throws Alice into a quest. Alice in Wonderland was never intent on being a quest, it was a trip through a totally different environment. In the 1951 version, Alice never had a goal in mind, she spent the entire movie dwelling deeper and deeper into an insane world. In here, we see Alice having to fulfill some sort of destiny for reasons not totally explained. The Mad Hatter isn't as mad as in the book (Or..well, you know by now). The Red Queen isn't as cynical or stupidly cruel asthe other installment.Last but not least, the movie just doesn't have the trippy look or feel as the book portrayed. Tim Burton is a one-trick visual pony: he rarely ever dwells away from dark and gloomy atmospheres. Instead of looking more like Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, it resembled that of Sleepy Hollow. Then we have the third act, which mimics that of Narnia, Golden Compass, Lord of the Rings, and the other fantasy flicks that propels the viewer into one final battle. Like previously stated, Alice in Wonderland isn't a tale about a quest, it's a trippy tale about a trippy trip into a trippy place.Bottom Line: The actors were good, the special effects were good, the music was good, but this version of the literary classic just doesn't feel like it should. The movie paces like a fantasy epic, when it should dwell far from it. Part of the charm of the book (and the 1951 version, which by now you should realize I find superior) is that it was so unique, so different, and so defiant of the normality in literature, entertainment, and storytelling. This Alice feels like another movie we've seen before, and with that statement alone, it fails as a remake, retread, or re-telling of the book. Sorry but I won't follow the white rabbit into this rabbit hole again.",5,14,28,5 March 2010
Avatar," Dances With Wolves: The visually-amazing, out-of-this-planet, year 2145 edition
","Every so often, there comes a movie that changes the way movies are seen, displayed, and filmed. These are the movies that visually change all the rules. Back in the late 30s, we had the instant classic Wizard of Oz, which was visually groundbreaking in every possible way. The colorful 60s was led by the epic acid trip 2001: A Space Odyssey. The Star Wars trilogy dominated the box office in the 70s and 80s and constantly set the bar for movies to come in terms of special effects and the overall visual look. Jurassic Park in 1993 and The Matrix in 1999 are other major examples. In 2009, we have our new special effects peak, and that is Avatar. The difference is between Avatar and all the other groundbreaking spectacles is that it's a visual trip that doesn't scream for a requirement of a second visit. While Avatar never dwells into disappointing or boring, it never propels to a level that has you begging for more.However, if there is something amazing about the film, it's the special effects. Motion-capture technology had been hit-and-miss for a long time, but James Cameron and his team have perfected the skill. A beautiful environment and setting emerges from the special effects as we see images and settings we've never seen before. This is basically a Star Wars for the new millennium, as its box office run has proved. The amount of effort placed on the visual effects is obvious here, as we see an alien species move, breathe, talk, and interact so realistically, you may forget that these creatures do not exist in the real world. Apparently there are people reaching some sort of subtle depression after leaving the movie theater because they suddenly know the beautiful world of Pandora doesn't exist (True story). Like previously stated, it all looks very nice, but the film is a 3-star helping served in a 5-star manner.Avatar's plot follows a handicapped soldier (Sam Worthington) trying to earn the trust of the creatures in the planet of Pandora in order to try to find a way to move the entire colony away from an area chock full of valuable minerals. This is a road often traveled, you know that at some point he will realize that what is doing is wrong, and at some point he will realize that the other people he is traveling with (American soldiers, businessmen) aren't going to care either. The script borrows major plot elements from Disney's Pocahantas (even if it is loosely based off a true story) and Dances with Wolves. The plot is part of the reason why it's such a global phenomenon; it's hitting all the well-accepted messages of anti-militarianism (not a word, don't care), pro-environmentalism, anti-deforestation, and themes of accepting other cultures. James Cameron has worked with some of these themes before, like Terminator 2 and The Abyss.The special effects and direction is what propel this movie into new heights, not just on the quality of the film, but the overall structure of cinema. You are transported into this new world, and Cameron adds these elongated sequences so you can become comfortable with Pandora and all its mystical wonder. Unlike Spielberg's patience to reveal his special effects tricks in Jurassic Park, Cameron gives you only 10 minutes and you will already become acquainted with the reason you came to see the movie in the first place. The motion-capture is flawless; the CGI is inches away from perfection (very, very limited amount of awkward-looking scenes), and the cinematography was spectacular. The camera moves and flows with the action seamlessly, and you always get a good visual grip of what is going on. The details were immense, as Pandora's overall look is a blend of beautiful scenery we have seen before and images that we can only dream of.Of course, reading this far, you know flaws shall become exposed and discussed. What makes Star Wars such a timeless masterpiece is not only its look, but the immense amount of out-of-this-world characters, unique settings, and impressive maneuvering through these environments. Jurassic Park remains a classic because of the lovable characters driven into a world they can't possibly survive in. With the case of Avatar, only the main character is likable, and everyone else is there just to propel the story along. In Avatar, the main character is the planet Pandora. In the other movies, the beautiful and never-before-seen-in-film scenery is just a backdrop for the events happening. Avatar doesn't suffer from Star Wars' mediocre dialogue, but it does suffer from an elongated running time, unnecessary scenes, and filler moments.The second act is where your patience is tested. The entire scene of our hero Jake adapting to Pandora could have been shorter. The entire scene of Jake's first evening as a Na'vi could have been shorter. What makes them seem longer is that you know what's going to happen next, and you have to sit there and wait for the more-impressive and more exciting third act to develop, when the action becomes center-stage. The final act makes up for the second act, with some intense fighting and plenty of tension and suspense. The ending, albeit a bit short, was fitting and consistent with the themes and tribulations of Avatar.Bottom Line: Avatar looks good, it looks like nothing you've ever seen before, but the story is something you've seen before, and the characters are people you've seen before, and the overall film is a well-known cliché, even if it's an amazing-looking cliché. James Cameron does a fantastic job updating the world of special effects, but with a repertoire consisting of The Abyss, Terminator 2, Aliens, and True Lies, one would ask for a better overall cinematic experience. Seeing it once was a delight, but wanting to see it again is something not in my heart's desire.At least it is better than Titanic.",7,2,4,22 January 2010
Grindhouse," It is everything you were wishing it would be, and more.
","With action, comedy, romance, drama, suspense, mystery, satire, horror, sci-fi, political commentary, thrills, and also a plethora of nods and references to previous works and previous genres; Grindhouse is a package full of everything and anything you can think of. Not only does it contain all that (and more), but also it has easily emerged as one of the best films in a very long time. Tarantino has finally met his match as Rodriguez has perfected his skills. Overall this film is just way too much fun to miss. Granted it is not for those easily sick or easily offended, those who can take the heavy content will leave the theater with a smile on their face guaranteed. Welcome, to the Grindhousereview.The review will run in order of the films and trailers presented. The tone is set with the hilarious and action-packed 'Machete.' Featuring Danny Trejo as a tough-looking renegade, the fake trailer is full of guns, action, and fun one-liners to repeat time and time again. We make our way into the first major motion picture, 'Planet Terror.' Planet Terror is the best part of the movie without a doubt. With fast pacing, a lot of action and terror, superb acting, fantastic direction, and enough gore to please zombie fans of any kind, Planet Terror is a horror fan's dream come true. To add to that, the make-up and the special effects here are beyond startling, and definitely not like the B-movies that Rodriguez is paying homage to. Robert Rodriguez has done some great work in the past; but this is him at the peak of his game. Not only does he continue the choppy/quick-paced editing and hardcore uncut thrills, but he also brings in a hefty dose of emotion not seen in his recent pictures. Also serving as the composer, he has a nice soundtrack to top it all off with the help of his band Chingon.After the trip of ecstasy that is Planet Terror, we get a few more trailers. The second trailer is directed by Rob Zombie, which is a bit weird but has a cameo that more than makes up for it. The mastermind behind Shawn of the Dead directs the one after that, and his trailer comes off as a hilarious treat. Topping them all however is the most disturbing movie trailer in the history of cinema, but also one of the funniest and most rewarding. Eli Roth (maker of the sadistic Cabin Fever and Hostel) is behind the camera on that bizarre and sick gem. After the trailers sicken the audience we then get a very mixed bag from Quentin Tarantino with his film, Death Proof.Unlike the approachable Planet Terror, Death Proof is proof (pun intended) that Tarantino cannot craft a mindless action film, or a film with little dialogue. Even with the little running time he is allowed, he still writes a doozy of a script in his segment. In this film, we follow the lives of several women as they enter a city that is haunted by the presence of a serial killer that uses a unique tactic of killing his victims: his car. But, unlike the previous flick, the buildup is quite slow, as character development is happening slowly but surely. The pacing is pretty much a quarter of the length of Planet Terror.Some people actually left the theater in the middle of Death Proof, which shows that they have not seen a Tarantino flick. If you like his previous stuff, then you will appreciate his usual blend of action and dialogue. Otherwise, do your best to stick around, because the payoffs are fantastic. Stating the genre that he is paying homage to would actually spoil the surprise, as it becomes blatantly obvious--but only in the end. Nonetheless, we get one of the best car chases filmed this decade, and also one of the funniest yet anti-climactic endings of its kind. The true beauty of Death Proof lies in the fact that you cannot predict where the story is going, nor can you predict where, when, and how it's going to end. Patience is a virtue, and the fruits of rewards come with the final segments of Death Proof. Despite all this, Tarantino actually provides the weaker of the two movies, which comes off as a surprise considering his track record (Pulp Fiction, Reservoir Dogs, Kill Bill Vol. 2).Grindhouse's look and style is authentic and only adds to its appeal that is already present. Besides all the raw footage with so much blood that you'll be checking your clothes from time to time, Grindhouse also has missing footage, unsynchronized audio and video, bleeding colors in the film, and a lot of dirt and dust all over the place. Don't worry; the films are still viewable, even if there are some times in which the missing footage comes at all the worst moments. The effort and time spent in this project is shown with all the little details all over the place. Finally, we have nods and references to not only films of the 60s and 70s, but movies from the directors themselves; including Desperado and Pulp Fiction. The die-hard fans will get the most out of Grindhouse, but the average moviegoer can and will get a kick out of this too.Bottom Line: Watching this movie is not a request, but a requirement. It is strong; it is violent and rough, but unbelievably entertaining. Everything about Grindhouse was spectacular, from the directing to the editing to the content to the extra goodies to the details to the acting to even the musical score. We have two of among Hollywood's best minds combining to deliver one heck of an experience that is refreshing and jaw-dropping at the same time. Both films are totally different, but almost equally ridiculously compelling. Grab some popcorn, and prepare to be dazzled.",10,1,5,13 April 2007
Up," Pixar delivers yet again. They must be cheating or somet---Squirrel!
","However they do it, whether it is by steroids, stem cell, Egyptian secrets, Babylonian water, or selling their soul to some monster, Pixar has been providing hit after hit, success story after success story since 1995. Surely they don't profit as much as their rival Dreamworks, but Pixar's films have lasting appeal that can and will span decades and generations to come. I severely doubt a century from now we'll remember Shrek or Madagascar the same way. Pixar's strategy has always been top provide tugs at the heartstrings for every time they deliver a laugh. This mix of comedy and drama has served them well in the past, with Finding Nemo and the Toy Story films being the absolute best examples. Up on the other hand, has overwhelmingly more drama and sad moments than laughs. If you can survive this little shift of film-making from Pixar, then you are in for a treat. Up is yet another grand film from the company that seems to do no wrong and it has great appeal for moviegoers of all-ages.Up is about Carl Fredrickson, a retired bitter old man whom is still reeling from the loss of his wife. Since children, they had a dream about going to Paradise Falls, a secluded location in South America. In her honor, Carl heads out on a quest to South America using his house, and thousands of balloons. Accidentally accompanying him is Russell, a trusty boy scout. Along the way, they'll meet all sorts of characters and more adventure than they could have ever imagined. Written by Bob Peterson (Responsible for Finding Nemo, need I say more?), the film explores themes of loneliness, letting go, life and friendship. The script excels with plenty of adventure, funny moments, and sentimental moments that will make you sniffle a bit.Forget 3-D. It's a stupid trend that will soon go away. The movie looks absolutely beautiful in 2-D and does not need any special effects for it to be appreciated. The people and animals themselves are composed of different shapes, representing their personality. Unlike in other non-Pixar efforts, realism (in terms of people) wasn't attempted, instead focus was on detail. The movie is amazingly detailed, but the production didn't demand as much complicated animation like in Wall-E and Ratatouille. Nonetheless, the film looks great, and yet again proves that Pixar is on top of the animation heap.The main strength of Up lies in the action and its characters. The film has plenty of exciting and perilous moments that keep you guessing how it's going to end. And then, there are the hilarious characters. Carl himself is likable, but doesn't provide as many laughs as Russell, and the eventual animals that are involved in their quest (especially the hilarious dog Dug with the special collar). Up falls more into the category of The Incredibles rather than Wall-E or Ratatouille because of its immense amount of peril. There's nothing wrong with that, just telling you it's not the Pixar fare you've seen in recent years.Like previously stated though, Up is a very tough pill to swallow in terms of its dramedy. The first ten minutes of Up are among the most heart-wrenching in recent memory, and towards the climax we have another moment in which you can't help but feel that lump in your throat. This sort of heavy sentiment has not been present in any non-Pixar animated film this decade, not even Shrek. It is hard to make a cranky selfish old man likable or sympathetic, but like in Finding Nemo with Marlin, knowing the past definitely clears all confusion and answers all the questions we would ask about their challenging personality.Bottom Line: Pixar strikes gold yet again, and in the form of a very creative story about an old man searching for adventure. All the elements that worked in all the Pixar films of the past are present here, and associated with a superb musical score by Michael Giacchino. The only reason you wouldn't like this film is if you don't like Pixar at all---in which afterwards it will be followed by questions concerning your taste in film. Ranking this film, I'd place it somewhere between The Incredibles and the original Toy Story as one of the 5 best they've ever released. How do they do it? It has to be steroids, there's no other explanation.When you're with Pixar, the quality of film has nowhere to go but Up.Highly recommend.",10,3,7,30 May 2009
Reservoir Dogs," Quentin Tarantino's cult classic that raised eyebrows over a decade ago still stands as among the best indie films ever
","Before The Bride had to kill Bill, before Marvin got shot in the face, before Mia and Vincent won a dance contest, and before dangerous gangsters start calling each other different kinds of fruits, someone had to get an 'earful.' If none of the references in the prior sentence are recognizable to you, then there is a problem. Reservoir Dogs is the film that put Quentin Tarantino on the map and captured the attention of critics and filmmakers everywhere. This low-budget instant cult classic remains a favorite amongst avid moviegoers and also influences a good portion of movies out today. Cleverly mixing dark humor with gruesome and yet realistic violence, witty dialogue, and also a fantastic cast of characters, Reservoir Dogs remains one of the greatest independent films of all time, over a decade since its release. What also makes this film truly shine is its unique storytelling and totally non-linear plot. This film is a true gem.Reservoir Dogs is the story about several men involved in a massive robbery that could result in many stolen diamonds and a lot of cash. After the robbery goes horribly wrong, it is then realized that one of the men involved in the heist actually told the cops about the plan. That is the plot, plain and simple, but what makes this specific plot different from the typical movie story is the way that it is presented. The plot is thrown at the audience like tossed salad, unexpectedly jumping from one event to the next in no particular order. What also allows this plot to shine is the heavy amount of dialogue amongst all the people in the film. The robbery itself is never actually shown, but all the grisly details of what happened as stated by the characters paints a perfect picture of what went on. This is one of the few films to ever come out that can be just as intriguing reading the script alone as opposed to seeing it unfold in the big screen.Casting was brilliant. The top performance in the film belongs to Michael Madsen, who portrays the rather psycho yet very calm Mr. Blonde. Madsen as Mr. Blonde has the standout scene in the film for sure as he flawlessly helps create one of the most humorous yet disturbing scenes ever captured on film. Everyone else did a superb job in adding a bit of realism and drama (and even some humor) into the film, including Harvey Keitel as Mr. White, Tim Roth as Mr. Orange, and Steve Buscemi as Mr. Pink. This film looks like an action film, but contains very little of it, nonetheless remains entertaining because of the suspense and never losing its pacing. It will keep everyone on the edge of their seats up until the very end of the film.Quentin Tarantino is one of the best directors out there, but what helps his status as among the top filmmakers is the fact that he can weave some very good stories. Like all his films, Tarantino keeps his films raw, out of control, uncut, and totally unpredictable. This kind of film-making is rarely ever seen, it is usually him and Robert Rodriguez that are known for producing films that perfectly blend action, drama, and a bit of dark humor. Another thing that separates Tarantino and Rodriguez from everyone else in the business is the careful selection of music. Instead of having a musical score all the way through, Reservoir Dogs mainly consists of several forgotten retro classics, and at many other instances, no music at all. This lack of an orchestrated score is another reason why his films are totally unique, yet unbelievably effective.The movie is much deeper than just a film about a bunch of people pointing fingers, there is much more to it. Requires several viewings, but by the end you will see all the dramatic irony, all the wonderful details in the plot, and even see the foreshadowing here and there. The film is truly a storybook come to life, details and all. The ending was simply perfect, it was totally anticlimactic and that is why it perfectly works. While the film itself is brilliant, the way the movie ended guarantees that Tarantino is not overrated in terms of what he does.Bottom Line: A superb film that should be viewed by everybody. There is nothing wrong with this film, and there is good reason why it had such acclaim, despite the lack of box office success. Even though this is not Tarantino's best work (Pulp Fiction takes the cake) Reservoir Dogs is leaps and bounds above the typical movie in terms of quality and importance to the industry. The casting was great, the dialogue was perfect, the directing was top-notch; everybody that wants to make it big should take notes. Reservoir Dogs: a tour de force that is so much better than the average indie film; it is no-holds-barred and out of control, and this is the way films should be made.Score: 10/10",10,0,2,7 October 2005
Pulp Fiction," Shot of adrenaline that lit up the film world of the 90s.
","Read this loud and clear: Pulp Fiction will never ever happen again. The impact, the delivery, the timing, and the overall stamp it has placed in cinema history can never be duplicated. See, there are bad movies, good movies, great movies, and trailblazers. The trailblazers are films that jump-start a movement, revolutionize the industry, change the landscape of motion pictures, and delivers an impact whether immediate (Star Wars) or down the road (Fight Club) that never exits the general consensus.Wizard of Oz, 2001: A Space Odyssey, Psycho, Jaws, Star Wars, Raiders of the Lost Ark, The Graduate, and Goodfellas are all examples of films that are trailblazers. None of these films have any contemporaries, they are their own category and all films of similar genres become compared to them. Pulp Fiction is a 90s indie trailblazer that absolutely altered the entire culture of movies by crafting what at the time was easily one of the most jarring, unexpected, stylish, and wholesome cinematic experiences ever witnessed.Pulp Fiction was a low-budget flick with such high aspirations that 1994 didn't know how to handle it. The soundtrack (among the best in film history), the unexpected blend of violence, drugs, and realistic dialogue, the surprises, the utter lack of chronological order, the style, the tone, and the overall look of Pulp Fiction made it stand out not just among the films of the 90s, but everything preceding it. It talks like a Scorsese movie, moves like a 1950s Italian neorealism flick, paces like a spaghetti western, and breathes like an underground comic book come to life. Pulp Fiction is tasty cinematic soup.Pulp Fiction knew it was cool before the viewer did. Pulp Fiction knew that its audience was going to put up with the 150 minutes of dialogue because the characters were so strong, the story lines were unique, and there were so many details (explained and unexplained) that it required multiple viewings to catch it all, and jump-started urban legends and mysteries that remain unsolved to this day. It was a movie that created its own culture and fanbase that would follow madman Quinten Tarantino for the entirety of his career---through the 'bad' (Death Proof) and the good (Django Unchained).Everything in this movie works. The cast was downright phenomenal and nearly miraculous considering the budget (Bruce Willis, Samuel L. Jackson, John Travolta, AND Christopher Walken in one movie??!!). The dialogue was sharp, witty, brutal, and breathes life into each character you see within the pulp-influenced saga. The directing by Tarantino was practically flawless as he makes transforms the camera into a curious witness by mixing in a barrage of close-ups, long shots, and spastic movement that never feels like its framing a shot but more so just following the story along where ever the action was going.This movie literally has it all: sex, violence, drugs, rock n' roll, dancing, singing, crime, morality issues, romance, revenge, monologues, potential miracles, shootouts, dark humor, dozens of film references, and even a couple glimpses of the California underworld that most people would rather not know about. And all this was accomplished without a Hollywood budget. There was a slight sense of amateurism that gave the movie an edge, like a black sheep in the meadows of the film industry. This would inspire an entire wave of budding, ambitious, and hopeful filmmakers that also had their stories to tell and didn't want to cater to the typical Hollywood output or abide by its rules. Pulp Fiction is a B-Movie setup executed like an underground masterpiece from the dialogue-heavy start to the sudden finish.You can't duplicate this. I couldn't duplicate this. Tarantino could never duplicate this. Pulp Fiction is one of the greatest films ever made, and a perfect storm of innovative filmmaking that lifted 1994 into one of the best years of film that has ever existed---and launched an entire era of indie filmmaking that still has its effects on the industry today. Pulp Fiction is as absolutely cool as its gets.",10,1,2,25 September 2014
The Da Vinci Code," Not a masterpiece but not a disaster either, Da Vinci Code will leave you entertained...and thinking
","Every single time that religion is depicted on film, there will be a problem and plenty of controversy behind it. It happened with Dogma years ago, Passion of the Christ not too long ago, and now with The Da Vinci Code. Now, apparently, I totally missed the memo that I was supposed to thrash this film to no end because it's confusing, boring, repetitive, and a written catastrophe of epic proportions. The Da Vinci Code is far from that; it is nowhere near as a bad as critics say it is. While the writing is different from the book (what book-to-film adaptation isn't?) and the directing is a bit flawed, this is still an entertaining murder mystery that requires an open mind and a will to receive a plethora of background information that will be revealed throughout the lengthy movie. It is rather obvious that critics and most of the public were ready to fail this motion picture from the moment the title is revealed.While it still isn't as shocking or as much of a page-turner than the original work, its Howard's fear of a backlash that results in this being different from Dan Brown's instant best-seller. Like Ron Howard's critically acclaimed Best Picture winner A Beautiful Mind, The Da Vinci Code frays away from shocking even more in order to avoid a recoil that will result in fewer people watching it. The weakest part of the movie is the writing and the pacing, which is what keeps it away from being an excellent film yet gives it potential in becoming an eventual box office success-turned cult hit (The Matrix). Anyone expecting an accurate description of the book will leave disappointed, even though some of the differences are actually pretty minor, and some actually result in the movie being a bit better. Lack of romance in the movie is a breath of fresh air as it goes against the average drama that needs to throw in some random love story in between the carnage. But, the first part of the film is built up way too slow, too much dialogue and pointless trivia can be found all over the place within the first half hour.Pacing is ruined because of this. Clocked in at over 145 minutes, The Da Vinci Code has the potential of giving you that nice, long nap that you've needed. Fortunately for us, the pacing totally picks up in the second stage, when the two main characters run into a crucial character, Sir Leigh Teabing. After they meet, the movie picks up and does not let go except for a few moments of slowdown. Ironically, the best action sequence involves a short yet satisfying drive towards incoming traffic while avoiding the enemyin the beginning of the movie. But, don't expect to just sit there and watch, thinking is required, learning is required, and so is the fact that this is all fiction and in no way is trying to question your faith. Actually, The Da Vinci Code does not question or bash any religion, it is an obvious fictitious tale. But when a thing such as God and Jesus is questioned, no matter what the circumstances are, we will have chickens with their heads cut off gawking obscenities at the body of work.It is about Faith against Fact, Fiction against Non-Fiction, Science against Christianity. This is the sort of stuff questioned constantly in the hit show 'Lost,' but it is presented in a more underlying manner, which is how it avoids the smoking gun of the public. Da Vinci on the other hand, is not afraid of such a touchy subject, even though Ron Howard obviously is. There is an entire portion of the book left off the movie, just so that it doesn't add to the negative hype. Another reason why The Da Vinci Code the movie failed a little is because Howard also underestimated the intelligence of the audience, as his clue-leaving skills from A Beautiful Mind sadly results in the majority of the public figuring out the plot twists before they happen.If there is a reason to watch this movie, it is certainly for the acting. Tom Hanks though, he really couldn't make his character that interesting, as hard as he tried. Robert Langdon is not that memorable a person, he is just another person jumbled in a religious mess. His assistant throughout the film is Sophie, played by unknown actress Audrey Tautou, whose previous works are mostly foreign movies. The best performances come from the supporting cast, especially the unrecognizable Paul Bettany as the amazingly creepy and psycho monk whose views on God and whatnot is just scary. Sir Ian McKellen also shines as the friendly and intelligent Leigh Teabing. Other notable performances come from Alfred Molina, and Jean Reno. The acting here is above and beyond the average summer flick, and runs this movie when the writing is running out of gas and Howard is taking a break from leaving obvious clues.Bottom Line: Risky, but not risky enough. Decent, but not decent enough. While it is not a horrible disaster, it does stand just a few steps above mediocre because of a few flaws here and there. A different director could have been better, and a better writing staff could have quickened the pace of the movie and also cut back on all the worthless dialogue that happens from time to time. We do have some Oscar-worthy performances here though, and we do have some beautiful, beautiful scenery to marvel at. While the Indiana Jones movies are much better in terms of hunting for religious artifacts, this movie isn't as bad as what the bitter critics have been showcasing as. The Da Vinci Code: Enter with an open mind, leave entertained and ready for discussion.",7,1,4,20 May 2006
Thor," The decent origin story of the black sheep of the Avengers
","Thor is the oddball in the Pre-Avengers movies simply because it concerns a character that is quite literally out of this world. That would mean that the origin story of this superhero would require more time, a heavier budget, and more emphasis on making him likable. There was a tougher task at hand: mixing in all the fantasy elements with the literal-down-to-earth elements and giving it the proper balance.For this main reason, Thor becomes very unbalanced as a script and as an overall film. When a movie looks like sci-fi Lord of the Rings on some scenes, and thennormal for the others it can become quite jarring. And for the majority of the movie it took a while for Thor to find its footing. Luckily once we get to the third act the movie does indeed take off.We do not have the best script in the world telling the story of Thor, but bad scripts can almost always be saved by good acting. And with the help of Tom Hiddleston, Natalie Portman (Who had the worst lines of all), Anthony Hopkins, and our lead star Chris Hemsworth, Thor survives past the clichés, past the slow middle act, and survives the sometimes-crummy dialogue.The action also paces like the script, plenty at first, minimal in the middle act, and plenty in the final moments. Even though the direction was a bit muddy (Kenneth Branagh's random career still hasn't given him the ability to helm big budget projects) he still delivers when the emotion is ramped up (which happens more than you may assume in a comic book movie).Thor's saving grace was the final waning moments starting from when Thor really gets to shine right up until the end, which was actually devoid of your usual blockbuster clichés. By the time we get to the end we are treated with a nice final action sequence, a few surprises, the emergence of a now-notorious villain (Now complete with a massive online following), and a great ending that doesn't wrap the production nicely, but sets the tone for things to come.As an origin story, Thor could have been a lot worse, could have been better, but considering having to follow up to the likes of Iron Man---this movie does just fine.",7,1,2,8 November 2013
Castle in the Sky," An epic animated adventure worth visiting over and over again
","Animated films can become a lot of things (especially nowadays with updated technology and a newfound respect for the medium), including romantic, life changing, groundbreaking, political, or sometimes just flatout surreal in scale. No longer are animated films just cartoons for kids to watch and enjoy, that stereotype is long gone. However, epic is not a word you can use to describe animated films, because they just don't happen often. Animated movies with the ability to become compared to the likes of Lawrence of Arabia, Gone with the Wind, Ben-Hur, Seven Samurai and other epic films past and present are extremely rare to find. However if there is a man that can weave a blockbuster animated tale, it would be the Japanese answer to America's Walt Disney. Castle in the Sky is epic in scale, with a massive adventure full of lush scenery, incredible action, memorable characters, and a nice dosage of humor. If there is an epic cartoon, it would be this underrated masterpiece.Castle in the Sky follows two kids that met under curious circumstances (Sheeta and Pazu) racing against pirates, the army, and mysterious agents in pursuit of a mythical castle located somewhere in the skies above the clouds. Sheeta is aided by a mysterious necklace given to her by her parents when she was younger. All the competition has their differing reasons on why they want to find the castle, ranging from gold to unleashing God-like powers. The film works mainly because the story is very unique, very original, and quite unpredictable. Written by Hayao Miyazaki, this film is the best evidence that his mind is among the most creative in film-making within the past century.The world displayed here is among the most gorgeous in the history of animation. There are massive airships the size of cities, caves that can look like the bowels of outer space, entire worlds that just float high midair and just entire towns built on the mountainside, leading to some unique and detailed architecture. No computer-work here, as this movie proves that hand-drawn animation's personal touch can be as magical as the best visual effects coming from any computer. The variety in colors and images here trounces those of Miyazaki's more popular works, like Spirited Away and My Neighbor Totoro.The epicness can be mainly traced to the consistent amount of peril and action throughout the two hours of pure movie magic. The opening sequence sets the tone for the rest of the film, while a humorous yet impressive train chase half an hour later provides some of the best thrills ever seen in an animated movie. Every so often humor breaks off the epic taint in the production, but it never dwells or outstays its welcome. Steampunk is a tough sell, since it's a historical and contextual contradiction. But in Castle in the Sky, Miyazaki gives the viewers time to adapt and witness the technological advancements and mannerisms of the characters in the film so you don't become too distracted by the unrealistic nature of it all.Miyazaki is the current Walt Disney, because not only does he avoid sequels (Pixar is unfortunately dwelling in this path) but he does his best to deliver a different animated experience every time he releases something new. Like Walt Disney himself, he can seamlessly blend humor, heart, and suspense all in one. He has the pacing, patience, and abilities of any decent Hollywood director, but with film you can do so much more. You can create shots that real-life cameras could never accomplish; and with animation you can create visuals that not a single CGI machine could ever duplicate. This is perhaps the main reason why Miyazaki avoids too much computer animation and avoids filming real-life altogether. When mentioning great directors like Spielberg, Scorsese, Peter Jackson, and David Fincher, Miyazaki is more than worthy to be mentioned in the sentence.Bottom Line: Castle in the Sky is a flawless work of art that spins audiences into a beautiful world full of steampunk goodness and lush scenery that's obviously influenced by the underrated landscape of Japan. Within the confides of this beautiful world (that travels by sea, land, and air) lies a wonderful story full of humor, heart, action, suspense, and an underlying message that's present in almost all Miyazaki movies. Pixar obviously has taken notes from the works on Japanese Walt Disney, as this movie has scenes and moments that can be compared to those of Finding Nemo, Toy Story, and even Up. If you enjoy excellent animated movies, you cannot miss this gem, as it's entertaining, thrilling, and mystical from the first second to the last.",10,4,5,16 May 2010
Zombieland," Indie Hollywood finally has an answer to the British classic Shaun of the Dead
","There just aren't enough movies about zombies nowadays. Now, vampires are the go-to horror clichés because of the emergence of the overrated, over-hyped, and overdiscussed Twilight. Now, a GOOD zombie movie comes along even rarer than a real-life zombie attack. Shaun of the Dead is the only exception to the norm, becoming one of the greatest horror-comedy hybrids in the history of film. Zombieland is a successful and entertaining American version of the cult classic. By combining action, comedy, horror, a bit of absurdity, and a small dosage of heart, Zombieland is America's first good zombie movie in an extremely long time. Its box office success can be attributed to the previous fact, by proving potential thrills not seen in the genre in over a decade. The most successful zombie movie in history deserves its major success.The plot is extremely simple, as it doesn't dwell deep into why zombies have taken over and also because there aren't that many speaking characters throughout the flick. Columbus (Jesse Adam Eisenberg), one of the remaining survivors, runs into a trigger and violence-happy Tallahassee (Woody Harrelson). They both team up together and go on a road trip towards anyplace that doesn't contain zombies---and contains twinkies. Along the way they run into a dangerous sister duo, a well-known actor (awesome cameo too), and of course zombies. Written by Rhett Reese and Paul Warnick, this movie contains plenty of action but also a lot of laughs and helpful tips. While Scary Movie started the entire how-to-survive-horror-movie shtick, Zombieland perfects it.Woody Harrelson runs the show in terms of performance and scene-stealing moments, but the rest of the cast does an admirable job. Jesse Eisenberg's dry subtle style of humor resembles that of Michael Cera, but let's just hope he doesn't carry this personality to every movie (therefore suffering the Will Ferell Effect). Of course in every horror movie you need attractive ladies, but Emma Stone (of Superbad fame) isn't just a pretty face to look at as she adds a mix of toughness, beauty, and quiet vulnerability. Final note, Abigail Breslin is always fantastic, and it's amazing she isn't 16 yet but displays the maturity of a professional actress.However, the best quality from the movie is the fantastic directing. Ruben Fliescher, a rather rookie director, directs this with plenty of flair and indie flavor. The slow-motion shots throughout the movie are some of the best you'll ever see, and they just add to the visual cleverness of Zombieland. The opening sequence is one of the best in recent years, as it immediately propels you into the mood and tone of the movie. Fliescher doesn't pull any punches as you will see plenty of blood, plenty of gore, and most of the carnage can be seen spewing right into the camera. The camera is never fixated, but is also never shaking to a point in which you can't see what is going on. The special effects are minimally used, which makes it much more effective. Sometimes, excellent make-up can provide better thrills and scares than the cop-out CGI.What makes Zombieland work is that it's as much of a comedy than it is horror and that minimizes the tension and allows for the audience to enjoy the ride---granted there are indeed a few scares here and there. This movie never takes itself seriously, which makes it more enjoyable and more gleeful for the indie crowd. For anyone getting tired of the gruesome rated-R horror movies with little character development, little reason to care, and awful special effects, Zombieland will become your breath of fresh air.Bottom Line: Zombieland is a brilliant action/comedy hybrid, and becomes the best film of its genre since Shaun of the Dead several years ago. Neglecting Shaun of the Dead, you have to go back to 1996 to find a superior horror comedy, which was the instant classic (and genre-changing) Scream. This movie has superb directing, great writing, a wonderful cast, plenty of action, and plenty of humor to look forward to. The only problem is that the movie is short and leaves you asking for much more. But this is the sign of a good movie, leaving you actually requesting a sequel.",9,0,0,25 February 2010
A Beautiful Mind," A harsh and gloomy story told in a most beautiful way, Howard, Crowe, and Connelly help craft a fine film
","Is a Beautiful Mind groundbreaking? No. Is A Beautiful Mind a cinematic achievement? No. Is A Beautiful Mind a drama that will change your outlook on life? Yes. Directed by Ron Howard and lead by an incredibly talented staff in writing, directing, acting, and musical score, A Beautiful Mind is leagues above the average drama and remains one of the few movies in recent years that actually did indeed deserve that Best Picture Oscar it had earned years ago. This film will make you laugh, will make you suspect, will make you cry, and will make you reflect on your life one way or another.A Beautiful Mind follows the life of mathematician John Nash. He is an extremely intelligent man but with his genius comes problems, issues, and situations that affect not only him but also the lives of the people he cares about the most. Throughout the film, there are many surprises and unexpected turns in plot that just reveals how his methods of thinking and attempting to find solutions ultimately eats away at his life. Russell Crowe plays Nash and pretty much nails it, one of the finest performances I've ever seen. You can even see him little by little break down emotionally as well as physically as he lived on with his problems. Jennifer Connelly is just as talented as she is beautiful, as she plays the loving yet frustrated wife of John Nash. Crowe and Connelly have excellent chemistry together, and their love for each other pretty much bleeds out of the film and into your heart, as you will have a lump in your throat during their best moments shared together. Another notable good job comes from Ed Harris, who plays a cold man hiring John Nash on a top-secret mission to help find out what the Russians are doing. The acting is basically what runs this film, but much credit should be given to the writing.Weaving a true-life story that needs to be told into a movie that can capture the interest of an audience is no easy task; especially involving the evil and cynical feature we all call mathematics. Fortunately for us, they kept the complicated, convoluted jargon that only true math experts can recognize to a minimum, even though there are times in which you are just better off zoning out as you see Nash engage into intricate arithmetic with other Princeton students. The story is paced well, as no section of his life is stretched way too long, nor does it ever become predictable. Ron Howard absolutely perfects his directing skills in this film, as he constantly leads the audience down one path, only to totally throw them off at the latest surprise. Kind of like Fight Club and Pulp Fiction, A Beautiful Mind may require more than one viewing in order to catch all the nifty details scattered about. Even the colors of the film are remarkably toned down as you dwell halfway into the movie.It is more than a biography; it is a love story, and a story about a man attempting to defeat a seemingly impossible task of daunting past his problems. While his dilemmas are far from normal, deep down, we all can sympathize and understand what he is going through, we all can see ourselves in him as he goes through his worst moments. But unlike most life-changing, eye-watering stories, this one didn't look like there was much hope, and as the viewer, you will almost deteriorate emotionally as badly as John Nash. Nonetheless, don't get the impression that this movie should be avoided if you are currently depressed or emotionally unstable, because underneath all the drama and chaos lies hope and anticipation, lies a chance that everything will be betterthis is what life is, an ever-changing quest for happiness that contains moments of darkness that seems to find no end. A Beautiful Mind is exactly an interpretation of life, that long, sometimes awful yet rewarding road that hopefully finds its way out of the bowels of rough terrain.Bottom Line: A Beautiful Mind should be viewed by everybody, as it gives a not-so-typical story about a man whose fears and issues threaten to get in the way of his first love, mathematics, and his main love, his wife. Acted out almost perfectly, and directed with few faults, this movie should change the way you view things or at least reflect a bit. While the dialogue does have its bits of slowdown, especially when the complicated math starts getting involved, this film is nothing short of spectacular. Highly, highly recommend. A Beautiful Mind: An extraordinarily beautiful film woven from a sometimes-ugly life story.9/10",9,0,2,14 May 2006
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," More of the same. Except its just the same. Just more of it.
","Bigger is better; that's what Hollywood and the Michael Bay team believes. They believe that if you hurl everything from the first film, enhance it a gajabazillion times, and then enhance it even more, you'll have a better film. This mathematical formula has been used for action blockbusters since the early 80s when Empire Strikes Back unleashed its sequelness for the world to see. However, for years, we critics (and moviegoers) have shouted back: 'Check the math!!!' Well, we don't really actually say that, but sometimes more of something is too much of something---get what I am saying? Let's simplify: Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen is basically the original film except louder, longer, more stereotypical, and even more anti-climactic. All the strengths and flaws from the original transform their way into the sequel, and the end result is another Michael Bay firestorm of explosions (you know the kind, in which there are explosions inside explosions).In Transformers 1 ½ (my interpretation, my title) we follow Sam as he heads off to college. But, trouble is brewing as a source of unspeakable energy is being hunted by the enemy (that sounds awfully familiar). Before you know it, evil transformers are everywhere, and our heroes see themselves being overwhelmed by the enemy and also by the United States whom is finding Prime and his followers more a burden than helpful. 8 million dollar script gets you a repeat of the original script, with more dialogue and more backstory. Call me crazy, but in a franchise known for the fights and the awesome robots, do we really need deep conversations about relationships? Roberto Orci (writer of Star Trek and several episodes of Alias) should know better. The other writers, well, their (Ehren Kruger and Alex Kurtzman) previous work wasn't as impressive.More. More is the recurring theme to this film. More transformers, more characters, more action, more talking, more exploding, more music, more comic relief, more build-up, more fights, more close-ups, more special effects, more scenery, more military vehicles and weaponry, more stereotypes, more danger, more deaths, and to top it all off, more animal humping. There was more Megan Fox showing off her body instead of her acting. There was more from the parents (Kevin Dunn and Julie White), as they throw in more sexual humor and a surprising bit of drug-related humor as well. The parents was actually one of the better portions of the movie, as they provided the best comic relief; much better than the hoards of transformers whose only job was to attempt to make the audience laugh.In a film that has more, there are surprisingly less of other elements. There was less Optimus Prime than the original, there was actually less robot-on-robot fighting, as more of the action sequences involved the military going at it against the robots (Funny how we only see the United States military in the entire movie despite the fact that the fighting took place in two other countries). Michael Bay cannot deny he loves the military and the weaponry brought, since this film could have passed off as an Army recruitment video describing and showing just what the United States army is capable of. Bay himself dons the same directing techniques as all his other films; the man is coming off as a one-trick pony.Despite all the setbacks, you will see this film for one main reason: the special effects. The special effects team yet again delivers some of the best work in history, as the transformers themselves look absolutely fantastic and full of detail. The special effects never drop from prime quality, and is the main strength in the entire film. The fights themselves do improve, as the scope and range allow us to accurately see who is fighting whom. Unfortunately, the third act is where almost all the intense and gigantic action is, as the previous two acts had little blurbs of action. What hampers Transformers 1 ½ even more is that like in the original, the final battle (and the ending itself) is extremely anti-climactic. When the main and grand finale does appear, you are already tired from all the build-up that happened for about 45 minutes. There just wasn't enough activity coming from our robotic heroes, all the focus was on the military.Bottom Line: Am I being too harsh to a blockbuster flick? Most people would say so but guess what, summer action blockbusters can be noisy, explosive, and smart at the same time. This has been proved with the likes of Jaws, Raiders of the Lost Ark, Last Crusade, True Lies, Speed, Pirates of the Caribbean, Terminator 2, and even Michael Bay's very own The Rock. Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen will satisfy the action junkies loosely, but only if they are willing to accept all the drawbacks, especially that of the franchise changing from robots vs. robots to man vs. robots. 150 minutes, several stereotypes, hundreds of explosions, and a couple dues ex mahcinas later, a weak sequel arrives.The ironic thing is I grade this film the same as the original. So, more does not equal better in this case, and more does not equal worse either. It just means, more of the same, and it's the same sort of stuff that prevents this franchise from ever being halfway-decent.",4,17,41,24 June 2009
Zero Dark Thirty," Gripping, Thrilling, and Quite Cold
","I walked out of Zero Dark Thirty with quite a headache. This is definitely what the film was aiming for, tension that racks up your nerves, increases your heart rate, and leaves you with your teeth continuously clenching. The movie will leave you breathless and numb, much like your better wartime movies like Saving Private Ryan. But all this comes with a catch---this movie is quite cold, and the timing of this movie gives it an emotionally manipulating tint.It is manipulating because it's the premise and not the cast of characters that sells this movie or keeps it afloat. It is the story that truly drives the movie, not the interactions amongst everyone involved. There is no character development, there are no catharsis moments, and nothing changes except for the progress towards the ultimate goal of killing Bin Laden. It is indeed an entertaining and a thrilling ride, but one wonders just how much mainstream and critical investment would be placed in the movie if it had not been so soon since the actual event.The plot is simple; a massive manhunt begins immediately after 9/11 for Bin Laden and the leaders of Al-Qaeda. The movie follows mostly the feisty and hardworking CIA officer Maya, as she scrambles, gambles, and fights her way through the government ranks into ensuring that the man behind the awful terrorist attacks gets his justice. Throughout the two-and-a-half hours we see major step after major step as well as setbacks delivered through misinformation, more attacks, and bad surprises. Written by Mark Boal, his script here is full of intensity, drama, and everlasting anxiety.On a technical and mostly artistic standpoint, the movie fires and hits on all cylinders. The performances were amazing, the technical direction by Kathryn Bigelow was superb, and the cinematography is among the best from any movie in 2012. That being said, the entire movie is extremely one-sided to a point that it almost runs as American propaganda.We know all about the whos and the whats and the wheres, but we never ever get a glimpse of the whys. In movies like The Kingdom and Three Kings we are presented with the motives, thoughts, and mannerisms of the Middle East enemy. But in Zero Dark Thirty it pulls a Hurt Locker and doesn't give us any insight whatsoever into the mind of the enemy of the Americans—they are faceless, nameless, and the audience is offered no chance whatsoever at sympathy. Which is borderline ironic because the movie itself offers minimal emotion, with the first hint of emotion coming from.a scene involving a suspect finally getting something to drink after nearly starving to death.Zero Dark Thirty is a well-shot film with many curious decisions, ranging from the timing of the film (waiting a few more years could have given the third act more details), to the sheer bitter and cold mood of the entire production hampering it and preventing it from becoming a modern war classic. Much like The Hurt Locker, it lacks the heart required to add the necessary layer of substance and depth into the movie. Despite this, it is a very tense ride full of exhilarating performances and gritty realism that gives Zero Dark the edge over your average drama.",8,3,7,2 February 2013
Wedding Crashers," Not an instant classic, but very, very funny.
","I never liked Owen Wilson. I think he is overrated, not funny, and usually just stinks up whatever film he is in, whether it is the already-bad I Spy or the well-done Shaghai movies with Jackie Chan. He was decent in the Meet the Parents movies, but because he had a small role. He is the main reason why I was not going to see this film. Plus, I knew nothing about Vince Vaughn at the time. After several weeks, several great reviews, and a ton of money and a ton of praise from audiences around the country, I finally decided to give it a try. This movie hands-down surprised me, I had no idea it was going to be this good. But, what ruins the film is what ruined Episode 3, made Fantastic 4 worse, and also what tainted Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. And also there was just too much Wilson, and certainly not enough Vaughn, who was certainly the funniest man in the movie.Wedding Crashers is about two men who crash weddings to pick up women but their biggest challenge comes at one particular wedding in which Owen Wilson's character John falls in love, meanwhile Vince Vaughn's character Jeremy has trouble staying away from the latest person he made love to. What was supposed to be a one-wedding visit turned into a weekend stay with a popular secretary (Christopher Walken) and his not-so-normal family. Throughout the entire film, you see John try to woo the already-taken Claire (played by the beautiful Rachel McAdams) and you see Jeremy have trouble containing Gloria (Isla Fisher). The movie is just amazingly hilarious; I had no idea that it was going to be such a hoot. There are many reasons why the movie is funny, but there is one actor that steals the show, and that is Vince Vaughn.Vince Vaughn has the best one-liners, the funniest moments, the best reactions, and also is the liveliest person on the screen. While Wilson kind of slows the movie and Walken does not put much effort into acting during this film, you see Vaughn get tied in bed, eat like a maniac, confess in a most hysterical way, and curse his way into one of the funniest performances I have seen in a very long time. The last time I saw someone steal an already funny movie from the first minute to the last minute is Jim Carrey back in 1994 when Dumb and Dumber came out. His scene in the dinner table just had everyone almost on the floor in laughter; it was so crude yet funny at the same time. This movie scores because it does not try too hard to be rater 'R', it embraces the rating, by throwing every curse word at the right time, by applying the nudity only at the correct moments, and by sneaking in some of the most crude humor in films nowadays just as the film shows signs of slowing down. It did not try too hard to pass the PG-13 rating.This movie was just doing so well for so long, and then decides to throw in some romantic elements into the film. What really makes me upset is when directors and writers try to add another element into the film, therefore making it worse than it should be. Action movies throwing drama (Transporter 2) or sci-fi action movies throwing pointless and pitiful romance (Star Wars: Episode 2) some films suffer from putting something else into the film that it really did not need. This movie did not need any romance or touching moments, throughout the first 80 minutes it was a fast-paced unpredictable comedy and during the last parts of the film it disintegrated into a slow-paced, sappy romance story that was literally saved by a spectacular cameo. Owen Wilson's depression just takes away the happy mood most of the audience felt throughout the first half of the film, and it just dragged, which is what kept this movie from being among the best comedies I have ever seen. At least the ending made up a bit for the sappy and pathetic moments. Maybe it was because I was watching it by myself, I don't know, but this film was going so well before slowing down almost to a halt. Nonetheless, this movie will make you laugh, and Vince Vaughn will catch your attention for sure, he truly surprised me.Bottom Line: Excellent movie, but its dragging towards the end keeps it away from being among the funniest of all time, with the likes of Meet the Parents, Dumb and Dumber, Airplane, the Naked Gun movies, and some of the classic Mel Brooks films (not in any order). Wilson was not funny, but his partner, Vaughn certainly was. Superb performances by the lead females and also excellent job by the writers, who managed to throw in a lot of funny and silly moments throughout the first half of the film. The cast obviously had a blast making this film, and you will have a blast watching it. Wedding Crashers: join the party.7/10",7,1,2,6 September 2005
Whiplash," Whiplash is cinematic freeform jazz: unexpected, unpredictable, and quite fulfilling
","Being an artist, whether writing something, filming something, or playing something, requires a special edge. This special edge is a passion that not everyone can possess, and not everyone can maintain. This special edge can alienate you from the rest of society, can cast you as a black sheep, can drain all your willpower, but at the end of the day if you are good at your craft this is all that matters.Whiplash is a grandiose work of cinematic bittersweet delight that explores that darkness of said passion and the drawbacks that comes with it. It is required viewing if you ever want to know what it feels like to be a tortured soul determined to be the best. There were only 12 people in the theater when I watched this: we all wound up clapping in the end.Whiplash thrashes around like bebop jazz: initially inviting, then becomes loud, unexpected, twisted, daring, violent, and entertainingly tedious. On the surface it looks like a simple tale of an aspiring jazz drummer entering a tough course with a nasty instructor becomes something much more. It is about two people that seek perfection in their craft in an art form that can easily hide the blemishes. It is about two people trying to succeed in a type of music that is a far cry from what it used to be. The olden days are referenced aplenty, from style to music to the victim artists within the genre.On the surface, it may look like a simple film to direct. But Whiplash contains a heavy and hyper dosage of extreme close-ups, long shots, fast alternating cuts, and just a dizzying cinematographic energy that is on par with the best action films. Damien Chazzelle not only writes the strong script that is far from predictable, but also gives the movie a strong flavoring of authenticity from the small details to the music that is ultimately performed in front of our very own eyes.The acting deserves Oscar nominations all around. Although J.K. Simmons will receive almost all the (well-deserved) attention for a spellbinding and flawless performance as a profanity-laced and dangerous perfectionist teacher that becomes a tyrant once the class starts, Miles Teller also deserves just as much acclaim for bringing his extremely devoted yet sympathetic lead character to life. The jazz action is intense, the blood, sweat and tears are frighteningly real. The tension is heavy in an unlikely Hitchcockian sense, and by the time you get to the climactic scene you will simply be swept away by the musical, emotional, and psychological madness.It is not an easy movie to stomach, it is a tough pill to swallow. But surviving the intense thrill dramatic ride of passion brings enough catharsis and snarky emotional payoff to have you hooked from beginning to finish. Whiplash is easily one of the best films of 2014 as it all comes together perfectly like a great jazz ensemble.Being an artist is zealous torture, plain and simple. Whiplash perfectly personifies this fact of life.And this type of torture is exactly why I am writing this review at 4 in the morning. And whether you understand this aspect of my life or not, I wouldn't have it any other way.",10,0,2,22 November 2014
The Wolf of Wall Street," Welcome to the Jungle
","Very rarely does a film weave in AND out of Best Picture of *insert year* territory, but Wolf of Wall Street manages just that.Accomplishing exactly what No Country For Old Men did years ago, this film was the greatest work of cinema in the calendar year----until the final act. That cursed final act that ultimately prevented this from becoming the Wall Street version of Goodfellas and Scorsese's best movie since The Departed.The first two acts was a man's man's man's man's film. It was ballsy, it was gutsy, it was directly in your face, out of control, and so full of testosterone you become unsure if you can handle it all. It threw you right into the world of Wall Street where there were no signs of softness and Martin Scorsese directs this with a certain rampant speed and attitude that made it all the grittier and edgier. The language, sex, immorality, and take-no-prisoners approach to life within the broker industry was in full display and even though it got jarring, it was still breathtakingly entertaining to watch. The script held nothing back, and neither did the editing, directing, and especially the acting.Leonardo DiCaprio gives one of the best performances of his career, and gives it an energy and furor that would make 90s Jim Carrey impressed. He threw everything he had in this role, as it required a stamina that very few actors can successfully manage. Even Daniel-Day Lewis couldn't provide a taste of the mayhem that DiCaprio provided. The rest of the cast excluding Jonah Hill (Who really, really bogged the movie down a bit) were also superb, especially Matthew McConaughey in a role that was far too short.The soundtrack was blazing and skipping around like an indecisive teenager using an IPod shuffle, the amount of detail was staggering, and there wasn't a single dull moment. Although our lead character was a terrible human being, you couldn't help but be mesmerized and slightly jealous at all his success, while also be enthralled at the cutthroat business he was engaged in.And then came the final act.This movie already had a heavy Goodfellas vibe from the getgo, bringing with it a predictable aura that brought the movie twisting towards a downward spiral that never recovered. If the first half felt like an adrenaline shot to the chest, then the latter half felt like a full bottle of sleeping bills taken simultaneously. With the shift in tone and pace, all the setbacks from earlier were suddenly being put out in full display. The editing suddenly looked weaker, the script suddenly lost focus, and the movie got repetitive, really fast. There was a great sequence of physical comedy from DiCaprio that forgave all the issues temporarily, but it was immediately followed by multiple failed chances to finish the movie in a strong note.Easily 35-40 minutes could have been cut, limiting the movie's predictable final act. But before you know it you are watching the slow descent into despair that muddles heavily after the animated testosterone-laden personality of the first half. Scorsese should know better, instead of coming off like a gambler who doesn't know when to quit while he is ahead and ending the evening dead even. Wolf of Wall Street is wildly entertaining, but being half a spectacular movie shouldn't earn you Best Picture, no matter how good the opening half is.But Best Actor however..is definitely, definitely here.",7,0,1,31 January 2014
Con Air," Flying solo men? Here is a film that will complete any Saturday night being spent alone
","If there is nothing else to do on your wimpy, pathetic, miserable life, then do what most lonely people should do on a Saturday night: check out a mindless action flick. Of course, the trick is, finding an actual good one. The 80s was a decade chock full of them, but the past two decades, we've seen quite a decline on full-powered action movies destined to destroy the plot and still be able to run on fight after gunfight after explosion after unnecessary roughness. The Rundown is an example of an action flick that doesn't allow the plot to conquer the film, and allows for style to conquer substance. The Transporter relies on an extremely simple plot and expands upon it with a long action scene that runs in the second half of the movie. Jerry Bruckheimer knows how to blow things up (a lot of things I may add), and while this isn't always good for Hollywood, which doesn't get many films nowadays that can be attributed to the word 'instant classic' or 'masterpiece,' the technique does indeed work for this movie; the mindless yet satisfying Con Air.Con Air has enough action, blood, and guts to make you look away at the screen and wipe off the bloodstains that have suddenly appeared all over your shirt. While being hyper-violent but not a point of losing too much realism, Con Air stands as one of Bruckheimer's best works, director Simon West's best work, and one of the best action movies to come out within the last 15 years. Also, unlike most action movies released in history, this one actually has believable acting, some convincingly tough and creepy convicts, and also doesn't allow the sappy moments to soak in on the running time.Convicts. Plane. Convicts entering plane. Smart convicts. Hero of story is at the wrong place at the wrong time. Convicts take over. Simple enough? Now, add the fact that more convicts have to enter the plane, add the fact that some feds want to shoot the plane down despite the innocent folks boarding, add the one guy about to die if he doesn't take his insulin, add the one female aboard and a rapist ready for his next victim, and then add the psychotic murderer who scares even the toughest aboard. We get conflict after conflict after conflict; it doesn't end. By the time the movie is over, we'll be able to see four to five fights, one massive gun battle, and a dozen action sequences, some ranging from short, to amazingly loooong.Scott Rosenberg does a superb job in giving the characters in the film a lot to do, even with the film clocking in at two hours. Also, he doesn't sap the movie up with too many tear-jerking scenes about Cameron Poe (Nicholas Cage) wanting to see his wife and daughter after 8 years. John Malkovich is excellent as the main villain, as he is violent, unsympathetic, yet portrays himself as trigger-happy, when he is much smarter than the impression he gives others. Ving Rhames does his usual awesome performance as the main villain's second-hand man. Rounding out the supporting cast is Dave Chappelle, Steve Buscemi, Danny Trejo, Mykelti Williamson, M.C. Gainey, and also John Cusack.Con Air takes no prisoners, literally and figuratively. This is a Man's film, and it's not for the easily offended or queasy. This film has it all: good fights, action sequences that stretch beyond the imagination, brutal deaths, amazing gun battles, and then an obsession with pyrotechnics that delivers so many explosions, it almost looks like World War III was going on. The special effects were excellent and was never overused, and rarely did it ever look unrealistic. But for some odd reason, everything flammable that you can possibly think of just happens to show up.With little time to think about what just happened, you are forced to sit there, like some of the victims in the plane, and go along for a wild ride that seemed to have no end. Nonetheless, it's a better ride than you would expect out of an action movie that has more fire than air in almost every frame. Witty dialogue, nice little twists, well-thought out sequences, and a cleverly creepy scene involving the most psychotic killer and the most innocent of children rounds out the 1997 action blockbuster.Bottom Line: Lowlifes, single men, get off your seat, and rent Con Air. You'll forget your troubles; you'll forget everything that's going on, because this movie won't allow you to think. Instead, you'll be practically forced to sit there and witness all the carnage, all the senseless violence, and all the bitter, no-holds-barred action that is sprinkled upon every single set and scenery in the movie. No, that's not a bad thing at all. Despite the fact that mixing action with good acting and great writing happens so seldom it can be considered a modern-day contradiction, Con Air pulls it off nicely. The movie doesn't take long to start, and once it starts, it will continue flying high on bloodshed up until the very end. This is indeed a Man's film. Before Snakes on a Plane, there were convicts on a plane. Difference is, the snakes didn't have motivation, or weapons of mass destruction. Con Air: please remain seated, and enjoy the trip",8,0,0,25 November 2006
Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy," Not quite as 'legendary' as some would hope, this one-liner bonanza is hit-and-miss, with too many misses
","What happens when a bunch of acting buddies take a crazy idea and stretch it to epic proportions? We get Anchorman: Legend of Ron Burgundy. Written by the lead actor Will Ferrell and director Adam McKay, and then improvised to death by the stars throughout the film, this is really a hit-and-miss movie. Unfortunately though, we get plenty of misses amongst the few hits. This technique of improvising the same scenes over and over again is what made movies like Caddyshack and Dumb and Dumber complete classics, and what saved Talladega Nights, but unfortunately wasn't enough to carry this film far enough out of boredom every so often. The plethora of cameos and surprise appearances couldn't quite save the film, despite for the most part being very humorous. Last but not least, there just wasn't enough Steve Carell.Anchorman follows the journeys of a popular San Diego news anchor whose placement at the top seemed to not have an end. Followed by his trusty crew and his news station, he remains on top of the ratings with his charm, ability to capture attention, and maybe even with his hair. Could be the hair, who knows? But, but, a rising anchorwoman was threatening his placement at the top and that thread is named Veronica. As she continues to gain support of the ratings, Ron starts losing respect, friends, and potentially, even his job. One side plot involves the constant rivalry between him and the other news stations, which escalates to epic proportions as the second act rolls around.Will Ferrell has his moments indeed, he can be a very funny man, and he is one of the leaders in one-liners. Yet, underneath the one-liners lie a lot of jokes that just fall flat, including his antics with his dog, his 'guns,' and his embarrassing way of trying to impress women. Same problem goes with the rest of the cast; they all had their moments in the spotlight, but at other moments were quite boring. McKay also failed to bring out any humorous moments with the lead female, the usually funny Christina Applegate, whose beginnings included her hilarious portrayal as Kelly in 'MarriedWith Children.' This idea wasn't meant to be a motion picture, but instead more like a Saturday Night Live skit, a recurring one at that. One would wonder if all the extra material filmed that didn't end on the final draft could have improved the movie a bit more.The best performance by far was that of Steve Carell. His expressions, his dialogue, his posture, and his comic timing is absolutely brilliant, if only others followed his lead. Steve Carell was an obvious star on the rise, and it was a total shame he wasn't utilized a bit more, because he delivered some of the funnier moments in Anchorman. What kept Anchorman going was actually all the cameos and small roles by famous actors, including Ben Stiller, Vince Vaughan, Tim Robbins, Luke Wilson, and Fred Armisen. Best part of the movie happens with tons of cameos, as all the crews of the competing news stations join together and.dance.Yet, after that amazingly funny scene, it all slows down almost to a halt. It becomes almost unbearable as the third act rolls around and we see Will Ferrell run out of improvising ideas and the writers running out of material. The climax falls kind of flat as well, with once again Carell helping a bit. The ending pulls in way too fast, and what we have ourselves is a quotable movie, but with nothing really worth watching more than once. Hey, just because you can quote it doesn't make it any good, right?Bottom Line: A reunion, a party, a festival of improvising fiends with a knack of stretching an idea and not being afraid to take risks is what basically makes Anchorman a watchable film at times, but then a bore at other moments. Obviously it was fun filming in an atmosphere where anything goes, but sadly not all the fun is transferred to the screen, to the viewer. We get decent scenes, and then get boring scenes. It was a hit-and-miss film like Talladega Nights and other Frat Pack movies, but unlike Talladega Nights, it gets kind of slow. Will Farrell can do these kinds of movies for only so long before they become repetitive, and its about time to explore other ways to make people laugh. McKay deserves credit for being able to film despite not having much control over the filming, but he should have filled in the gaps in between instances of comedic gold with some material. You can get by on improvisation for only so long.",8,2,4,11 December 2006
Inception," Whether this is all just a dream or reality, Inception is the Hershey's of eye candy
","Back in the 7th grade, a creative writing teacher repeatedly told the entire class that in storytelling, never ever ever ever ever end the story with 'it was all a dream.' The best example she gave us was the television show Dallas, which was ultimately killed ratings-wise after pulling the feat. That being said, it was very hard to not think about this rule of thumb when Inception starts. Inception is a crazy mind-bending, heart-pounding, and spine-tingling thriller that boggles the mind, tests your willpower, and keeps you one step behind. Keeping up is an impossibility, the images presented are some of the craziest in recent memory, and the overall experience was a very tense trip.This was the cleverest sci-fi flick since the severely underrated Minority Report years ago. There is one major difference between the nearly-flawless Minority Report and the oh-so-close-to-flawless Inception: the subplot. While both movies have their main characters trying to relinquish past personal demons, Minority Report molds it into the main storyline without issue; whereas Inception's subplot deters away from the fun and mayhem of the main conflict. My interest level was waning on the subplot, while remaining at the maximum during the heist. Despite that setback, Inception is a sinister movie that is worthy of a couple viewings.Inception is an original script by Christopher Nolan, who has proved many times before he can deliver in the screen writing department. It concerns a fugitive from the United States (Leonardo DiCaprio) that specializes in stealing ideas from people's dreams. He assembles a crew for his toughest mission yet, instead of stealing ideas, actually implementing one into the mind of a person. This plot description is very basic, because part of the mystique and fun of Inception is engaging yourself in the trip of a storyline as it goes through different twists and turns. The dialogue is strong, the story is intense and deep, and the rules about dreams and how to survive in them are well-implemented.Just like in The Matrix and Minority Report, Inception's rules about the universe the characters are engaged in are all established and explained quickly in the first act. In a nice move, the deeper and more confusing of the rules are explained as the movie progresses further; in a much more successful manner than the elongated conversations in the Matrix trilogy (especially the second installment). And, just like in the two examples, the visuals strongly compliment the story and all its rules. Inception is easily one of the most visually striking and impressive movies of the 21st century, by far surpassing that of Avatar. Cities are built and destroyed, a hotel loses all evidence of gravity and physics, and entire buildings crumble like Legos. The best part of this movie is easily all the chaos that you get to see. I strongly admire Nolan's attempts to use the least amount of CGI possible. And in this movie (just like The Dark Knight—his previous movie), the lack of CGI helps the overall look.The cast of actors and actresses definitely help the movie as well. That being said, only DiCaprio and Marion Cotillard have to truly flex the acting muscles, while the rest of the cast adds style, sass, humor, and realism to the experience. Directing them with precision and attention to detail is the screenwriter himself Christopher Nolan. He directs this far better than his Batman movies, and delivers his best directing work since the underrated Insomnia. He handles his shots carefully, and does a great job engulfing the viewers in beautiful scenery. And the hotel sequence is one of the most unique action sequences ever composed. It left the audience silently begging for more.So what could possibly be wrong with the movie? Great production value, great script, deep material, grand action sequences, good acting, and let's not forget the strong musical score of Hans Zimmer. The issue comes with the pacing and the editing of the movie. The first quarter of Inception runs rather slow and lacks that first excellent suspenseful piece that was in The Matrix and Minority Report (The opening encounter with Agent Smith and the first arrest scene, respectively). Then there is one of the subplots, which while it is important to the storyline, really drags down and breaks the pacing of Inception. The main character's conflict wasn't fleshed-out very well, nor was it that interesting. It's similar to The Matrix's totally unnecessary romantic sequences---necessary to plot, but highly inferior to the rest of the movie.Bottom Line: Removing the essential but rather bland subplot involving our main character, Inception is a purely majestic sci-fi flick that will boggle the mind, test your imagination, and satisfy your craving for something original to watch in the summer. The entire production value was excellent, from the musical score to the directing to the cinematography. I keep mentioning The Matrix and Minority Report because those two movies were the last two times a science fiction movie absolutely blew me away—before this one of course. Inception will entertain, confuse, and mentally defeat you (in the first viewing at least), but it's just a few knots below the two examples in terms of overall quality.Don't let that bring you down though, because Inception must be watched on the big screen in the best quality screen imaginable. Without the usual heavy use of CGI, Inception brings you into a crazy imaginative world where despite a variety of rules, nearly anything is possible. Watch this with an open mind and mental preparation for visual and content insanity. Recommend but with a fair warning: this is not for the mindless.P.S. I love the final shot of the movie, even if I did groan a bit. And you will too.",8,2,4,17 July 2010
WALL·E," Pixar is stirring the animation pot again, but not everyone will enjoy this recipe
","Pixar has been known for pushing the envelope not only for animation but for content within the films themselves. From the controversial storytelling elements of Ratatouille and The Incredibles to even the slow pacing of Cars, Pixar never follows the same formula twice (Even Toy Story 2 felt different from the original). While this adventurism is indeed good for the movie industry, it will have a tendency of missing the mark a few times. Wall-E is a defining example of risk taking to the maximum level. Blending no dialogue with slow pacing reminiscent of classic films, a bleak outlook on humans, and a space theme, this was recipe for financial disaster. Rarely do animated space films work, and even less when the content and plot is woven so deep that even most adults will miss the point. Wall-E is a beautiful, beautiful film, but an extremely tough pill to swallow. The movie-going audience of today would have trouble watching the works of Charlie Chaplin and even Stanley Kubrick for that matter. Our attention span has dropped in recent decades as a whole, and because of this, Wall-E forces us to let go of our usual methods in watching movies and makes us think, ponder, wonder, and perhaps even fear of what's becoming of our society.This method of forced thinking can and will alienate people from this movie, and some will find this movie boring, dull, slow, and claim there's little going on. In actuality, the plot is extremely deep and rich, and full of morality and social commentary. So much goes on in Wall-E, that most of the movie's plot actually runs underneath the main story about a robot that develops curiosity and a love for another robot. Wall-E has stories about commercialism, technology, end-of-the-world moments, contamination, acceptance of life, change, and of course, love. Wall-E is a robot used to clean up the Earth in a time in which no humans are living in the planet. As the years pass and he continues to organize the trash, he develops a personality and it leaves him lonely and sometimes depressed. Eve, a feisty robot, comes in to Earth in search of something. Upon their meeting, it sets off a series of events that will span centuries, galaxies, and a running time of 103 minutes.We can all question the quality of the pacing and the story itself, but to criticize the animation in any level should result in some lecturing of your peers. Wall-E is hands-down the best-looking animated film Pixar has created, and perhaps of all-time. The animation here is way up there with the likes of Sleeping Beauty, Beauty and the Beast, and of course Finding Nemo. Every last detail is spot-on, and adds a bit of irony to the movie as the more realistic-looking moments of Wall-E are the robots; and the more cartoonish feel of the movie comes during the witnessing of humans in the future. Helping the animation is the brilliant cinematography and sweeping movements of the camera that carries a hand-held feel throughout the first half of the movie.The lack of dialogue isn't a problem as long as there is plenty going on. In Wall-E a lot happens, but you are placed with the job of piecing some of the parts together throughout the motion picture. Wall-E and Eve share excellent chemistry together, and they rarely exchange words. Wall-E himself is a very adorable character, among the best Pixar has invented. They even made a roach likable, and this takes a lot of effort. However, the movie's running time can still be shorter, and the pacing could have picked up at least a little in the second half. When the adventure shifts gears; so do the tone and the direction of the tale. Subtle cynicism is the best way to describe the setting of Wall-E's future, as it looks very bleak for a long period of time (like a loose mesh of the classic book 1984, and the roughly similar 2001: A Space Odyssey).Wall-E runs into problems by swimming too deep into uncharted and dangerous territory in terms of presenting their story. Despite being a mere 103 minutes, it's a long 103 minutes, especially for children. While there is plenty of Wall-E in the beginning, he sort of disappears into the river of events that occurs later on. Even the adults may miss the big picture of Wall-E, and it's never good when nobody can truly grasp what is going on. For full enjoyment, you need a watchful eye, an open mind, a lot of patience, and a love for the idea of space being the final frontier. Otherwise, Wall-E will disappoint and bore you. Andrew Stanton of Finding Nemo fame tries blending substance for adults and kids to enjoy, but with the material it's tougher to accomplish just that especially when compared to Nemo and especially Toy Story. Deep down, it's a modern-day version of 2001, a tame rated-G movie with a lot more going for it than anyone could imagine. We can spend much more time truly dissecting the film, especially with the countdown towards a bleak future beginning at only one century past our time.Bottom Line: Despite the efforts, despite the amazing animation, despite the willingness to try something new, Wall-E falls into the category of a minor disappointment, especially by Pixar standards. It is a great movie, don't get me wrong, but it is a tough movie to watch, a tough movie to fully discuss, and nothing like anything you have seen within the past several years. Be prepared for a unique cinematic experience that boggles the mind and warms the heart. Unlike all the other Pixar movies, this is not going to be everyone's cup of tea. But if it is, what a tea you'll be drinking.",9,1,3,28 June 2008
Rango," Zany, trippy, bizarre, unique, and perplexing. But it totally works.
","After an extremely weak first quarter in the cinematic world full of remakes, re-dos, 3-D flicks and movies about gnomes (reallyreally?) we finally have something fresh, original, and quite trippy to kickoff 2011. Once again reaching into his Western roots, Gore Verbinski makes up for what he did to World's End and delivers one heck of an animated film. Rango is full of surprises: surprisingly violent, surprisingly smart, surprisingly full of western references left and right, and with a surprisingly incredible western score that matches that of Ennio Morricone (never thought I'd say that). If you can muster its sluggish start, extremely fast-pace humor and rather bizarre moments throughout, then you will thoroughly enjoy Rango and its Western mayhem. And who said the Western genre is dead....Rango (Johnny Depp) is a chameleon that after a mishap inside his tank comes across a town full of desperation and hopelessness. With a little bit of luck and a lot of lying, Rango becomes sheriff of the town but runs into a lot of trouble when the water supply hits low and tensions start rising. The storyline is nothing new, but the script (Good work John Logan) is full of fresh ideas, fun action pieces, and a great assortment of characters. In the midst of the script lie so many homages and references to classic westerns you can make up one heck of a drinking game.A strong factor into the fun of Rango is the excellent voice acting, which rivals that of Pixar's best casting work (See: The Incredibles and Finding Nemo). Johnny Depp is phenomenal in all his crazy roles, and his performance of the hilarious Rango is nothing short of brilliant. But, let's not forget the great work of Isla Fischer (as the lead female), Bill Nighy (as the sinister Rattlesnake Jake), and the great singing of the owl mariachi (Los Lobos). And speaking of singing, let's talk about music. Hans Zimmer was robbed when Inception didn't win Original Score, but he deserves even more praise with the score here. It is an incredible mix of guitar, strings, orchestra, and nods to masterful Morricone, and is hands-down the best score since Michael Giacchino's 'Up.' I am strongly contemplating buying the soundtrack if it's out in stores.The three main reasons why Rango works: Johnny Depp, Hans Zimmer, and Gore Verbinski. Very few blockbuster directors have the zaniness and range of Verbinski; as his repertoire includes Pirates of the Caribbean (epic blockbuster), The Ring (horror), The Mexican (I still don't know...) and Mousehunt (underrated dark family comedy). His talents can be shown here as he interweaves strange dream sequences with unique action sequences and plenty of hilarious moments. This movie also doesn't hold back for the kiddies, as it has the language, adult dark humor, strong themes, and heavy violence of a good-ol' western. Just picture what were to happen if Chuck Jones directed a tamed Quentin Tarantino script. And Lord knows there is not enough Chuck Jones influence in the modern animated movie world.Bottom Line: Rango works because of its fresh originality and its refusal to follow the clichéd rules of children animated flicks. It ditched the 3-D, ditched the watered-down tone we see all too much, while we experience a very unique take on Westerns while at the same time see plenty of odes and homages to them. The zany edge of classic Warner Brothers doesn't happen enough in this millennium (With Emperor's New Groove being the outstanding example) so its great whenever we see a Chuck Jones-style of entertainment. While the movie is quite gritty for a PG flick and some of its off-color content may throw you off, I am confident when I say that Rango is the first good flick of 2011. Once again Depp, great job. Your career is astounding and even underrated in critical acclaim standards. Zimmer, I think its time to start making an Oscar dedicated to you, because that was quite a musical trip. And Verbinski, I forgive you for World's End.",8,73,98,7 March 2011
Wonder Woman," DC Finding Its Groove Back, Wonder Woman is propelled by great direction and Gal Gadot
","I have been a vocal critic of the Warner Brothers/DC array of entertainment since Dark Knight Rises disappointed me immensely during that one fateful night. And for years after that I have been led down a dark path of pure disillusionment that ranges from the frustrating Snyder saga that gets nearly everything wrong, the unforgivable Teen Titans reboot, the strange cartoons we've seen of Batman, and of course the fiasco involving the animated adaptation of Killing Joke's abysmal first act. It's reached a point in which I was accused of just hating DC altogether. But I have finally seen a good side of DC cinematically, and it's in the shape of Wonder Woman.Wonder Woman isn't perfect, but is hands-down the best product from the DC/Warner Brothers spectrum since The Dark Knight ignited and changed the film industry back in 2008. Whatever issues you can dig up in the movie will be eradicated by a superb cast, great amount of respect for the source material, and an entertaining flick with a nice blend of action, comedy, drama, and comic book flair. The film doesn't try too hard to win you over, as it paces nicely to allow you to warm up to our newest Wonder Woman and her allies.Damaging some of the momentum of Wonder Woman has nothing to do with the movie, but its actually the timing. If this had been made and released before Batman vs. Superman and the revelation of Justice League it could have had a deeper impact to the DCEU; similar to when the original Iron Man jump-started the ultra-successful Marvel series of films. Wonder Woman sets the correct tone and mood for the DCEU and is the first of the modern DC properties to successfully establish the direction the comic book company was engaging in. It's dark, its gritty, doesn't have much time for jokes, even if we saw plenty of them in the first two acts.Gal Gadot is absolutely perfect as Wonder Woman. Whatever complaints you may have had about her should be diminished off of the face of the earth because she gave the role life, personality, a sense of wonderment, a layer of feminist power, and the exotic flavor to truly separate her from the rest of the characters in World War 1 Europe. She has great chemistry with everyone around her, especially Chris Pine as Steve Trevor, the WW1 spy that accidentally stumbles upon the hidden world of Themyscira. Trevor's initial appearance allows the plot to move from Diana's hometown to wartorn England, where she wants to find the source of the war and end it as soon as possible using her warrior skillset, determination, and desire to make the world good again. Of course, with war, there is no easy answer, there is no person to point to, which contradicts Princess Diana's viewpoints of the way the world works.Not sure how Patty Jenkins, a great but quiet director, wound up with the director's chair since she isn't as big a name in Hollywood. Nonetheless, she does a great job with Wonder Woman by spending time with the characters, allowing us to get to know everyone, and showcasing the horrors and consequences of war to complicate a simple plot. Then we have the feminist empowerment imagery and the well-designed action sequences that make up for the budget that isn't quite as high as that of the Marvel blockbusters. The village battle sequence especially is a delight. The final act however behaves a bit much like Marvel when it could have behaved more like the grounded Dark Knight in terms of content and execution (the villain should have been handled differently, common theme in recent comic book films), but it won't ruin the overall experience in the least bit.Wonder Woman connects better with the audience than the modern Batman and modern Superman. Chalk that up to Snyder and the subpar writing team, but Wonder Woman just might wind up being the new face of the DCEU because of Gadot and the way she has handled the character. This is the one branch of the franchise that needs to be protected from weak sequels and weak decision-making towards the character's future. They have something great here, about as strong as Robert Downey Jr.'s Iron Man portrayal. I beg they don't mess this up, as Wonder Woman is the best-written and performed cinematic female superhero since Elastigirl from The Incredibles.We finally have a DC movie on par with Marvel. Even though Wonder Woman imitated Marvel a bit too much in the climax, this is still a step in the right direction. Jenkins, Gadot (especially), Pine, Allen Heinberg (wrote the script), and the rest of the cast should be proud for striking the right combination between comic book mayhem and great emotional depth to allow us to care for the cast. I am silently begging that DC and Snyder doesn't mess this up, even though the track record would say otherwise. Wonder Woman is a long-awaited empowering delight, and hopefully a sign of more great DC-related works to come.",8,5,12,14 July 2017
Straight Outta Compton," This film has got somethin' to say
","This movie would not have been greenlit 15 years ago.And this movie took a decade to finally receive the full backing it needed to fully produce the story behind the rap group that started it all.Perfect timing too.Straight Outta Compton a surprisingly powerful and deep film that looks into the trials, tribulations, successes, and failures of the three main men behind N.W.A.; a group that fueled a short-lived but powerful revolutionary run of success with its urban attitude, strong lyrics, and absolutely biting commentary on devastating realities that music had never dealt with up to that point. N.W.A. became notorious for bringing light to living in the deepest parts of California while dealing with a society that constantly makes it difficult for them to branch out. This film doesn't just highlight their beginnings and eventual rise to success, it also deals with the outcome of their decisions and what happens when the wrong people are mixed in.Some have argued that the aftermath bogs down the movie, that the third act becomes a slight drag. But truth be told, no storm literally or figuratively is at its strongest in the aftermath, but at the point of impact. From the first tense scene on, Straight Outta Compton holds very little back in terms of the lyrical content, the violence, the drugs, and the disturbing environment they have to survive in as they fight for a way out. Gang members pleading for the next generation to stick to their books, cops destroying houses they believe might have drugs, and a systematic cycle of violence and grimness that comes with the impoverished life. The script gives light on the good, the bad, and the ugly part of representing the hood culture that N.W.A. managed to (slightly) escape with their bittersweet poetry.Movies representing this lifestyle and the people in it hardly get a good budget and good production value to back them up. But thanks to the powerhouse moneymakers that Dr. Dre and Ice Cube have become, it is now a hell of a lot easier for them to tell their story: and they got a great writing cast, great production team, and a superb director (F. Gary Gary has Friday and Italian Job in his resume) to back them up. Back then you couldn't have dreamed of an N.W.A. movie containing great cinematography, wonderful editing, and fantastic musical score (outside the source material) to follow a talented young cast that emulates the men behind the group perfectly. The movie is sleek, crisp, and sounds better than most of your biggest blockbusters.There is no scaling back the content and the lifestyles during Dr. Dre, Ice Cube, and Easy-E's rise to the top. Some of what you see is concerning and slightly paints some ugly on their personalities, and that's why the third act albeit not as energetic is required. Consequences are indeed dished out, people are lost, friendships and partnerships are tested, and devils left and right challenge the foundation and wellbeing of our main cast. The story is never pretty, whether they are buying a new house or losing it. This is why Straight Outta Compton succeeds as a film, very little sugarcoating while giving each character their good side as well as their dark side.The sugarcoating does exist though. With Ice Cube and Dr. Dre producing, I'm sure there were some skeletons in their closet that were not going to be revealed; especially when it involves the N.W.A. tours, the nasty rap beefs that followed (back when rap beefs had some actual meat), and especially during the darkest days of Death Row Records (led by rap music villain Suge Knight). Reputation is key, and I'm sure that Cube and Dre want to avoid any further controversies as their market value remains strong. They are now businessmen far removed from the dirty days of mixing records and avoiding arrest for being black. But hey, it's their money, so it's their story.Straight Outta Compton is a big budget biography that hits all the right notes, even though it doesn't aim to tell the entire story. But there's a lot that needs to be said, and plenty was unveiled within the 140 minutes of great acting, superb writing, and tight direction. It is a rags-to-riches story, except for the fact that the rags followed them long after the riches came pouring in. If you think it's just a simple movie glamorizing the gangster life then you aren't seeing this with an open mind and both eyes open. The story took a while to be displayed on screen, but thankfully the moment has finally come, and it definitely doesn't disappoint.",8,6,37,21 August 2015
The Dark Knight Rises," A gloomy finale to our first grand superhero trilogy
","I wanted to truly enjoy Dark Knight Rises.I honestly did. I wanted to appreciate the grand direction, the excellent acting performances, superb cinematography, obvious amount of effort, and excellent wrapping of a trilogy that revived Batman and DC Comics from the Quality Dead.I wanted to appreciate the obvious (and subtle) nods to the classic Batman comics and other works of literature. I wanted to appreciate and truly adore the way they fleshed out the Batman arc with containing story lines of the other two installments. I wanted to truly engulf myself in all this and hail this as the ultimate chapter in arguably the greatest superhero trilogy in the history of film.However..I can't get past the fact that the running time was zooming past 160 minutes, when 30 minutes could easily have been cut. I can't get past the fact that the appearance of Batman himself was reduced to just a couple appearances, getting far less screen time than many secondary characters (especially the villains Catwoman and Bane). I can't also get past the fact that Batman is contradicting some of his fiercest creeds. Rather ironic that two of our biggest criticisms of the 1989 version of Batman were happening here. I can't also get past the fact that within the first half hour, there were about four story lines rummaging around and we had to wait until the end of the entire first act to even get the Dark Knight.What most strikes me about Dark Knight Rises is that the utter lack of catharsis. The trilogy has always suffered from this, replacing payoff moments with moment after moment of despair. The gloom and doom of Batman works as long we have smaller tuned moments to exhale and relax the nerves. Dark Knight Rises has absolutely none of this throughout the nearly-three hour affair. Yes Batman is the antithesis of your Marvel heroes, but a little humor and deviance from the main conflict couldn't hurt the movie. Even Spider-Man 2 in the midst of all Peter's dramas still had the escapades at the Daily Bugle to infuse some relief into the movie.While the ending definitely redeems the preceding hour of tragedy and tension with plenty of twists and surprises (Thank goodness), and the final act was far better than the first two, I still can't help but miss the fun of the superhero subculture. Dark Knight Rises is definitely a well-crafted finale to the massive story arc, but it's not exactly a ride you'll want to experience over and over again.",6,4,9,20 July 2012
Iron Man," Lives up to the hype, and just might trigger even more hype for the sequel
","To kick-start the 2008 blockbuster season is an enjoyable entertaining first look at Marvel's answer to DC's Batman. After years of begging, one of Marvel's more popular comic books appears on the big screen equipped with a stellar cast, massive budget, and drastic marketing campaign displaying how much more fun it is to follow the man in the metallic suit rather than the man in leather. Iron Man is a film that contains enough attitude and energy to intimidate other films of the same genre. Much like Batman Begins, Iron Man slowly but surely explains the origins of our hero and displays how and why he becomes the superhero that we all know. The only difference is Iron Man is simply a lot more fun and enjoyable to watch.The hero in this tale starts off a womanizing, sarcastic, selfish and carefree leader in a weapons manufacturing business. Tony Stark was trying to sell his latest greatest inventions overseas when suddenly he is kidnapped and is forced to manufacture weapons for the enemy. Right then and there he realizes that he's accidentally producing for the enemies as well as for the allies. Upon this revelation and being caught up in the middle of it, he crafts his greatest invention: which is a killing, nearly invincible machine full of ammunition and tricks. With a few major adjustments, this ultimate weapon becomes his new alter-ego, which is the heroic yet fearful Iron Man.Iron Man's biggest strength lies in the realism. Guess what, Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) is not a flawless hero, he has his moments of questionable decisions, lack of morals, and inability to see some of the dangers he creates. His secretary (Gwyneth Paltrow) is not a mere toy for our hero, nor does she settle for Stark and all his flaws. The lack of attempt to make the superhero seem perfect is definitely a breath of fresh air when compared to recent comic book movies. To add to that, Iron Man is not a mindless action movie full of explosions and carnage; most of the movie focuses on Tony Stark and his transformation from carefree millionaire to protector of the general public. Using a great script from Mark Fergus and Hawk Ostby, the movie is sprinkled with great one-liners, good dialogue, and very little slow-down and unimportant moments.Robert Downey Jr. does an absolutely stellar job as Tony Stark, and fits the role perfectly. Paltrow, Jeff Bridges, and Terence Howard do pretty well with the material they were presented, with the exception of one scene that wasn't supposed to be funny (Bridges can't yell). Complimenting the acting is the special effects, which never overpowers the actors nor does it overpower the scene. When Iron Man is fighting, the only thing you can do is sit back and enjoy the wild ride. The special effects weren't the greatest, but they certainly got the job done. Unfortulately, the final fight wasn't that great because we witnessed robotic carnage to the nth degree last year in Transformers. Topping Spielberg and Michael Bay is never easy in terms of action pieces.What keeps Iron Man from becoming a comic book movie with the top-notch quality of the best comic book movies (My personal favorite is Spider-Man 2) is the fact that the main character and alter ego need time for presentation and introduction to the audience. The potential in the Iron Man franchise is not only immense, but it basically spills into the screen at all times, especially in the final moment after the credits. Iron Man is the beginning of something potentially very special. Spider-Man 2 had the advantage of us knowing the man behind the suit, and got the pass to deliver two hours of intense, emotional, and excellent film-making. Iron Man 2 can be the next Spider-Man 2, as long as the same amount of dedication and effort is put into the project.Bottom Line: In the meantime, we have one heck of a flick here, as Iron Man dwells beyond the typical comic book flick and delivers a great start to the 2008 summer movie season. Great acting, excellent special effects, and more promise for the future of Iron Man should be enough reason for you to see this. Even if you don't know a lot about the comic book, the movie does a great job in presenting the man behind the iron mask in all his glory (and anti-hero glory). Recommend, as the beginning of a great franchise is offered here.P.S. Except a killer soundtrack here too.",8,2,4,8 May 2008
The Emperor's New Groove," It's not groundbreaking or fantastic animation like Pixar, but it more than gets the job done
","What film is one part insane, one part extremely fast-paced, and overall a movie that breaks down the fourth wall so many times you are almost involved in the film itself? Well, there are multiple answers, but if there is one film that fits this description, it's The Emperor's New Groove. With stellar voice work, pacing that is faster than most films within the past decade, and also containing a dose of silliness that just doesn't happen in enough films, this Disney animated flick stands as the best amongst the animated Disney films (excluding Pixar) within the past three decades and easily the most underrated. While we see Stitch everywhere, the furious campaign behind Chicken Little, and the attempt to make a worldwide smash out of Dinosaur, Disney seemed to have little support towards this little flick. Nonetheless, this is the little film that could; as it defied lower-budgeted animation, defied a song listing, and delivered some of the funniest moments and one-liners in animated history. It also managed to destroy the long-running Seinfeld curse, as it made Patrick Warburton a solidified voice-acting star. Most amazing, David Spade was actually quite funny without the assistance of Chris Farley. The Emperor's New Groove follows a bratty prince by the name of Kuzco (David Spade) that lives without a care in the world as everyone caters to his every whim without question. When he fires his adviser though, things get interesting as Yzma (Eartha Kitt) and her dumb yet reliable assistant Kronk attempt to kill him, only to instead turn him into a llama. After the mishap, Kuzko needs to actually rely on someone other than himself (Pancha, voiced by John Goodman) to regain his position at the throne and stop Yzma. Easier said than done, as Kuzco must change his ways in order to succeed. Lilo and Stitch is not the black sheep of Disney films like advertised, its this one. With only one song, lack of detailed animation, total rundown of the fourth wall, and also a defiance of a plot without its holes, The Emperor's New Groove relies on quick, witty humor and its lively animation to keep the kids and adults entertained. To add to that, this is the first Disney film in ages to contain some true character development, as we see Kuzco slowly rise from a selfish brat into a likable character as he spends more time becoming a llama. Partly written and directed by Mark Dindal, his fast-paced animation and action techniques were perfected here after the underrated flop Cats Don't Dance years before. The voice acting is what carries this film from decent to beyond superb. From the zany and quick-witted David Spade, to the veteran John Goodman, to the funny and lively talents of Eartha Kitt and Patrick Warburton, those four ran the film with excellent one-liners, funny moments, and a chemistry that is very rare amongst animated films. Easily some of the best voice work in any animated film, as long as one of the four was at the screen talking, the laughs would just continue rolling in. We even have the late veteran John Fiedler lending his voice in a hysterical cameo. Easily quotable movie, and that is always a plus. One can say that this has a sort of Frat Pack comedic-like quality to it, as it doesn't rely on a deep story with morals, but instead on humorous situations and quirky lines to convince the viewer to watch again and again. Bottom Line: Among the best non-Pixar animated films within the past two decades, Emperor's New Groove is a fresh new look at the way Disney films are made. No longer do we have a romance story, no longer do we have a Disney princess in distress, we have a great cast of lovable characters in an environment that even gets the viewers involved. With a zany plot, clever one-liners, a lot of visual humor and a running time that never actually drags, there is really nothing really wrong with this movie. David Spade's last funny movie, the destruction of the Senfeld curse, and also the revival of Eartha Kitt's career can be found here. Watch it, no matter how old you are and what kinds of films you enjoy. Anyone that doesn't get a kick out of this one just doesn't have a sense of humor. 10/10",10,1,2,5 January 2007
Monsters University," The Unnecesscary is strong in this one
","Pixar, where has your courage gone? In this decade alone, we have been treated to two sequels, a prequel, a princess story (as if Disney doesn't have enough of those), with another sequel on the way. Pixar's Dreamworks mannerisms has been kind of unnerving, especially when we have seen the ballsy efforts like The Incredibles, Ratatouille, and especially (especially) Wall-E. The original stories are occurring less frequent, and while it's leading to guaranteed money for the company and Disney the die-hard Disney fans and film fanatics have been less than impressed.And now we have Monster's University. Surely the charm is there, the animation is the usual Pixar quality, and the production value remains the best in the animation business. But there was a constant sense of pointlessness to this prequel throughout the whole thing, and it lacks the heart and humor of the original Monster's Inc. The originality of the 2001 gem is also missing, as University dwells into familiar clichéd territory in the second half.This movie works well with the tykes and the true-blue Mike and Sully fans, but with the rest of us who really didn't care much to see how they met----well, there's not much here. It is simply about Mike and Sully's rivalry during the start of their university career and how they had to learn to accept each other if they ever wanted a chance to remain in the school.In the grand scheme of the G-rated filmmaking culture, Monster's University excels and surpasses that of the normal fare. But this is Pixar we are talking about, a company that bleeds pure quality and has created some of the greatest animated films in history. They have raised the bar too high to create something so.normal. It is odd from a Pixar movie to see failed jokes and a sense of predictability.It's not as funny, not as heartfelt, not as surprising, not as deep, and not as engaging as Pixar's best, and not even Dreamworks' best for that matter. It is simply light entertainment that will calmly entertain and not overwhelm---while at the same time not linger in your memory like Pixar's best like Toy Story, Nemo, Ratatouille and Up.Good but not great—and in Pixar standards that should never be good enough.",6,16,23,30 June 2013
Casino Royale," Would you drink with this James Bond?
","There are two kinds of Bond, James Bond. There is the sophisticated James Bond, the kind you would love to have a drink with (shaken, not stirred), and discuss politics, life, and religion (by religion, politics and life, I mean women). Then there is the other James Bond, the cynical, cold, merciless, gadget-free, ruthless, and all-around intimidating man that can kill you with his looks (actually kill you folks, no metaphor here). The more sophisticated Bond has been seen in more movies, as the likes of Roger Moore, Sean Connery, and Pierce Brosnan portray the classic character well. The other kind of Bond, the deadly one, hasn't been seen as much. Timothy Dalton proves that he could make a great villain as well as a James Bond, but this version of the spy has closer ties to the book. For whatever reason though, sophistication and suave is preferred on the big screen.But after a temporary revival with Goldeneye, the franchise yet again dips towards silliness, so a third revival is needed (might be fourth, but who is counting?). What we have here now is Martin Campbell yet again trying to boost the franchise, and a new Bond. His name is Daniel Craig, whose film experience includes a lot of low-budget independent flicks made overseas. Daniel Craig has the body of a spy, but lacks the sophisticated look. Which can only mean he is going to be the- Bond. Angry-I'm-Going-To-Destroy-You With-A-Paper-Towel James Bond. Craig plays this role perfectly, and even exposes Bond to weaknesses, a rarity in the series. However, this new Bond will not be everyone's cup of tea. Even the opening credits aren't Bond-like, as there is a surreal lack of women. Craig doesn't use gadgets; he goes through places with his feet and his fist, and whatever item is nearby. He is brutal, heartless, and becomes vulnerable in only one instance. Unlike the previous Bond, he doesn't have much patience, he doesn't talk much, and he just doesn't try to woo anybody. This is action-packed Bond, and Casino Royale has plenty of action.Casino Royale is chronologically the first time we encounter Bond, as we see him mold from cruel, impulsive, dangerous spy to a calmer, more calculated killer and defender of justice. Martin Campbell yet again does a good job in crafting a good action movie with plenty of lighthearted and romantic moments that ease the rising tensions that spring throughout the movie. We can also thank Campbell for introducing American audiences to Free-Running, which is a new trend that started overseas that can pave the way for on-foot chases to come. We can also thank the writing staff for bring Bond back to earth with realistic stunts and fights and locations (Paul Haggis, who has penned quite a lot of acclaimed work lent his skills here).The only problem is the action might be a bit too much for a Bond film. The James Bond enjoys success because it deters a bit from the mindless grunge of action flicks by providing dosages of beautiful women, unique villains, and fun character interactions. This one feels more grunge than Bond, and that may alienate some, while it will also bring in new fans. Also, Craig and the lead Bond lady (in this case played by the beautiful Eva Green) just pales in comparison to the chemistry in another Campbell movie: The Mask of Zorro (Why Catherine Zeta-Jones and Antonio Banderas are not together in real life is beyond me).Bottom Line: Casino Royale is a good Bond flick as long as you don't mind a revival of Timothy Dalton's version of James Bond. However, if you like Pierce and Sean, then you might be in for a nasty surprise as we see a vulnerable, and a not-as-likable James Bond running around creating havoc and frustration for the enemies. One necessity to a good movie is a likable main character, no matter what he or she does. This James Bond is well-portrayed, but not as decently fleshed-out as the action set pieces in this movie (best example is the insane chase/shootout in Madagascar). Craig was well-received, so be ready for the franchise gearing in a new direction, whether you like it or not. Be ready for a more violent, less gadgety Bond. For those of you that don't like this new Bond, there's always the new version of Get Smart. Why are you laughing?",7,1,3,7 July 2008
Toy Story 3," By delivering an amazing finale to an amazing trilogy, all we can do is bow and thank Pixar once again.
","Star Wars. Indiana Jones. Fistful of Dollars. Bourne. These are all incredible trilogies that can, will, and should stand the test of time. Yes, I am neglecting the fourth Indiana Jones. Upon the mention of the third Toy Story, I was deathly afraid. Afraid because it has some major, major shoes to fill. The original is a masterpiece that changed animation forever, and the sequel is among the best in the history of film (I mean that). The first two Toy Story films are among the best movies of all-time and to this day entire animation studios have failed to duplicate an ounce of the magic contained in Toy Story. Could part 3 even come close to the original two? My friends, I am very happy to say, the answer is a resounding yes.Toy Story 3 does exactly what the first two did, delivered on all cylinders, all aspects of film-making and entertainment. The humor is back, the heart is back, the delightful cast of characters is back. This time, thanks to an incredible script, there's more suspense, more drama, and many more surprises. Like any spectacular trilogy, it wraps up all loose ends. It literally is difficult to find any flaw or any slow moment in this movie, and even if there is, it will immediately be forgiven by the next major laugh or the next major revelation. The predictability factor in this movie is low, and the payoff to all the suspense is extremely high. Guys, this is the go-to movie of the summer, and makes up for any disappointment you have seen this year or last.Just like Toy Story 2's subtle and underlying themes, Toy Story 3 revolves around the group of toys and their latest adventure, but dwells far deeper than that. On the surface, this movie is about the toys in a series of circumstances, winding up in a daycare center that isn't all it seems. At the same time, Andy is heading for college, but Woody isn't quite ready to let go of his owner and the memories that follow. The deeper aspects involve aging, growing up, and moving on. Michael Arndt, the Oscar winner that wrote Little Miss Sunshine, was behind the spectacular screenplay in this third trip in the world of toys. Then with the help of John Lasseter and Lee Unkrich (who serves as the director), we see plenty of references to Pixar, other movies, the previous Toy Story installments, and even we even see nods to the influences of the entire animation studio (Miyazaki).The writing wasn't the only thing that was on par with the first two Toy Story movies. The voice acting cast was once again phenomenal, with popular actors, underrated talent, and great character actors filling the bill. Come on now, just read em': Tim Allen, Tom Hanks, John Cusack, Wallace Shawn, Jody Benson, Estelle Harris, Blake Clark, John Ratzenburger, Ned Beatty, Jeff Garlin, and Michael Keaton. Unlike what Dreamworks pulls off on a yearly basis, Pixar carefully chooses their voice cast in terms of pulling off the best performances, not to generate more money. Because honestly, was there even a point to Angelina Jolie voicing the tiger in Kung Fu Panda? On the other hand, very few can pull an authentic Barbie like Jody Benson (a.k.a. Ariel in the Little Mermaid). It takes reliable and authentic acting to pull at the heartstrings, and everyone definitely was on their A-game.Lee Unkrich directed this movie with incredible pacing and just as much heart and dedication as Lasseter, who was in charge of the first two. The truth is, Pixar directs the movie together, as they share ideas and suggestions amongst each other. This fact can be traced to the similar pacing and directing styles seen in Pixar's better works like Ratatoille, Finding Nemo, and Up. They all have the similar technique of incorporating just as many tears as laughs. But unlike all the other Pixar movies (with the exception of The Incredibles), Toy Story 3 has a heave dosage of suspense and peril, which is climaxed by one of the most exciting animated sequences this side of Castle in the Sky (a Miyazaki adventure masterpiece). Other reviewers have noted this before me, but this Toy Story is quite scary in depth and in imagery at some instances, so be wary of this while watching this with the kids. With so much time invested with these toys, the drama runs a bit high.Bottom Line: Toy Story 3 secures its place in cinema brilliance by becoming the best third installment since Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, the best sequel since Kill Bill Vol. 2, and the best movie we've seen this year. This movie is usually hilarious, sometimes thrilling, and sometimes downright tear-jerking. And yes, just like Up's opening 10 minutes, there is that one major sequence in which Pixar will play with your heartstrings like Eric Clapton playing tears of Heaven. If you enjoyed the first two Toy Stories, there's no need to worry about the third and hopefully final chapter in the quality-filled saga. How Pixar manages to deliver yet again is absolutely beyond me.Walt Disney may not be one-hundred percent proud of his company if he were alive to see it now, but he would be absolutely delighted at seeing what beautiful art Pixar has delivered ever since 1995. Pixar has re-created Walt Disney 's magical methods of storytelling and movie-making, and arguably has taken it a step even further by adding depth to the characters and depth to the overall stories presented. The direction was fantastic, the writing was Oscar-worthy, and the overall production is Best Picture caliber. This is Pixar's best work since Finding Nemo, and a must see by any means necessary. Despite my cynical nature, there's no way I can grade this any less than perfect. Just no way.",10,480,592,18 June 2010
Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs," Defying every science book imaginable, the third Ice Age becomes the most surreal of the trilogy.
","The Ice Age franchise is the lone wolf in the computer-animated franchises since its not from Pixar or Dreamworks yet however makes a fantastic amount of money and receives a good amount of praise. As a matter of fact, the original Ice Age remains one of the better non-Pixar efforts since 1995, when Toy Story started it all. Unfortunately, the sequel failed to live up to the original, despite the best efforts from Scrat, the unofficial mascot of the franchise. In the third installment though, the amount of believable material slips to a dangerous low as we have dinosaurs underneath the ice in a totally different atmosphere. Then with more characters introduced, Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs was beginning to look like Shrek the Third: too many characters, not enough plot, and too many futile attempts at humor coming from multiple different angles.Despite my predictions coming true loosely, the movie is surprisingly enjoyable. As a matter of fact, it was a few quips away from topping the original, while surpassing the second installment in every possible way. Scrat is as funny as ever, and some of the unfunny characters from The Meltdown have their shining moments in this film. The animation is beginning to lag behind Pixar though, when before they were getting close quality-wise (especially with Horton Hears a Who).Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs is about the entire crew discovering an entire ecosystem full of dinosaurs underneath the ice. Both worlds collide when Sid (John Leguizamo) accidentally takes some dinosaurs eggs while looking for new ways to entertain himself and find new friends; after seeing Manny (Ray Romano) focusing all his attention to closely being a father, and Diego (Denis Leary) suddenly leaving the pack. Along their travels, they'll meet a hyper and bizarre weasel named Buck (Simon Pegg). The other portion of the movie has to do with the lovable Scrat chasing an acorn along with a female squirrel that may or may not want him.Dawn of the Dinosaurs is a highly unbelievable movie, and it was crafted in a way that made it obvious that the writers wanted to milk the franchise even more yet couldn't find the proper way of doing it, so they dwelled even deeper in fiction. The first two Ice Ages were at least loosely scientifically realistic. This one breaks all rules covering which animals thrived in which time periods. Luckily for us, the dinosaurs were not the main focus of the film as much as the heavy assortment of main characters. Just like in the second part of the trilogy, the chemistry amongst the cast just wasn't there, and the voice acting yet again isn't to blame. Poor Ray Romano and Denis Leary, they just have no material to work with, and it hinders their voice work. They do deliver more laughs this time (even the opossums), but it's still not as present as the first Ice Age.The writers ruined and saved the movie. The concept itself was bizarre, surreal, and just didn't mesh well with the rest of the series. But they did craft some clever sequences of peril and did throw in some hilarious obstacles, especially the bit with poisonous gases. We also have a decent amount of modern-day references to Star Wars and even current issues. Then of course, every scene Scrat was in was comic gold. I stated this in my review of The Meltdown, but Scrat (just like the penguins of Madagascar) needs his own movie immediately. His Road Runner-Coyote-like antics just make the film and remain the top reason to ever watch an Ice Age movie.The director of the original was not present in the second, or in this one. This is probably why the original remains the best. Chris Wedge, the voice of Scrat, proved to mesh emotion and comedy best with his work on the award-winning short Bunny and his lead director duties in Ice Age. The third installment is directed by Carlos Saldanha, the co-director of the first and main director of the sequel. His strengths and weaknesses are the same here, as he doesn't mix emotion with comedy well, and gives the wrong characters too much screen time. Buck's (the main new character) antics themselves were very hit-and-miss, with the misses being quite painful.Don't let all the bad news bring you down though, the movie is indeed funny, and if you liked the previous efforts, there's no need for you to skip this one. It's just that with the bar in quality being set higher and higher as animation and storytelling is beginning to evolve in a much more mature manner, it's harder and harder to claim that this movie stands out amongst the mediocre ones.Bottom Line: Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs is a grand step forward from the second part with superior humor, superior pacing, and more Scrat hilarity. However, the emotion still doesn't mix well, especially with Up's incredible ability to rip you to your emotional core a few months back. More characters doesn't necessarily mean more humor, and its time that everyone learns this. Madagascar 2, Shrek 2, Shrek 3, Cars, Shark Tale, Ice Age 2, Ice Age 3 all suffered from the same fate of having too many characters, and then cutting back on the characters that we enjoy watching most. Dawn of the Dinosaurs: Surprisingly funny, but not fulfilling and ultimately quite forgettable.Quote of the Film: 'I don't speak wind'",7,1,3,8 July 2009
Vicky Cristina Barcelona," Its like a Travel Channel documentary, with annoying narration and a yawn-worthy plot packaged within
","Woody Allen's work has been around for several decades, creating quite a livid and faithful fanbase that dedicate their lives to watching his yearly films. His films range from romantic to mysterious to even sometimes the realm of science fiction. After a brief slump that was cascading through the 90s into the early part of this decade, Woody Allen re-enters the mainstream with a string of successful and acclaimed movies he filmed overseas. Allen's success derives from his deep flicks about love, affection, sexuality, etc.; and they reached their peak in terms of tone and theme in films like Match Point and Scoop, his 'comeback' movies. Riding the success wave with his latest muse Scarlett Johannson, Allen now heads to Barcelona to deliver another tale about the complexities of love.Let's get one thing straight here: the man is a tad on the overrated side. Surely none of his movies can truly resemble that of your usual romantic comedy dribble, but its nothing spectacular. Perhaps it's the fact that I'm still bitter that Star Wars, one of the greatest films of all-time, was defeated in the Oscars by Annie Hall. But it could be that his sense of humor is extremely dry, his views on love are just absurd and become repetitive, and the films never quite take off. His movies start in shallow waters and remain in shallow waters, with every so often a curveball being flung by for good measure. Vicky Christina Barcelona is no different; it's a film that doesn't quite take off, even with grand performances, a nice soundtrack, and beautiful cinematography.This film is about two women (The Muse and the unknown Rebecca Hall), one engaged and the other free-spirited, spending the summer in Barcelona. Upon their wanderings, they run into a handsome and charming painter (Javier Bardem) who wants to make love to both of them. A few twists and turns later, Vicky gets married but has doubts about what she wants in life, and Christina moves in with the painter; only to have complications arise once the ex-wife (Penelope Cruz) comes into play. Like previously stated, Allen's movies are never predictable or dwell into stereotypical territory, but the film lacks any sort of dramatic or comedic tension.To further simplify why this film can never be viewed as good or great in my eyes, Vicky Christina Barcelona presents a total of four main characters in a world full of love trying to figure out what it is. No conflict really arises, no climax is ever actually approached, and we never really care for anyone nor do we hope for someone to end up with someone. We are just witnessing, not really interacting or choosing sides. Plenty of dialogue, but very little of it actually enhances the plot. As a matter of fact, we learn most about our characters whenever the narrator (that comes out of left field most the time) describes the scenario at hand and how everyone is feeling.Nothing is more hampering to an actor or actress' ability to perform than a narrator in the background telling you how they feel. This is what hampers everyone's performance, we know how they feel not because of their actions or reactions, but because some guy in the background is mentioning their sentiments. It's annoying, and perhaps why critics believe Cruz didn't deserve her Best Supporting Actress Oscar, even though personally I'm glad she finally earned something for her work.Not bashing everything though. The cinematography is absolutely stunning here, as Barcelona looks its absolute best on the big screen. One would wonder how much better it would look in Blu-Ray; it can pass off as a Travel Channel documentary. The sets within the city are fantastic as well, further emphasizing the beauty of the setting. Adding to the allure of Spain is the fantastic choices of music. The classical guitar and laud-back music are like little finishing touches on the cinematic shots of the towns and restaurants within the city. Allen's direction has definitely improved over the years, as he broadens the horizons and films more than just characters muddled in dialogue. Too bad he couldn't write a better story.Bottom Line: I love him. I don't love him. I might love her. I don't love her anymore. We should all love each other. More or less, this is almost every single Woody Allen picture, and this one is no exception at all. But unlike Annie Hall, it doesn't even end very properly, by not proving enough closure. If you pressed mute throughout the film, you'll see why some credit should be given: the sets, scenery, and direction. Removing mute reveals relentless and repetitive dialogue and annoying narration; both elements ruining the acting and music of the entire film. This isn't the worst film of the year, but is indeed far from the best. Vicky Christina Barcelona is reserved for those who truly enjoy Allen's work—the good, the bad, and the pretty.",5,2,7,4 April 2009
Saving Mr. Banks," Truth, not all the truth, yet nothing but the truth, Walt Disney's Saving Mr. Banks is a Best Picture Hopeful with all the good credentials
","Walt Disney Pictures rarely aims for the Best Picture crown, being more a company focused on profits and sustaining its wildly popular brand. To make you haters hate more: they've earned $4 billion this year already and this includes the $200 million loss of Lone Ranger). They usually only distribute the movies that have a shot at Academy Awards immortality, with The Help (A Dreamworks film) being the latest example of a nominee and No Country For Old Men being their latest example of a winner.But with Saving Mr. Banks, Disney is going the whole nine yards. With a stellar cast, seemingly endless budget (Giving John Lee Hancock a much-less stressful job in directing), high production value, and heavy dosage of drama that hides beneath the happier movie trailers, this film stands as one of the better dramas of the year and a sure-fire Oscar-contender. Touching upon the tissue-happy themes of forgiveness, family, and seeking happiness in a miserable world, prepare for waterworks throughout the two hours.What makes this movie work more than anything else is the screenplay that didn't start in the studios of Disney, allowing for a more accurate portrayal of the true story behind the making of the masterpiece Mary Poppins----even if the entire world knows that with the backing of Disney some details will be left out. Kelly Marcel and Sue Smith weaved out an engaging story full of crisp dialogue and skillfully avoids becoming too overblown or too overdramatic. And whenever the movie gets close to being all-out depressing, we get treated to humorous moments here and there to keep the audience in check.In a movie about artists that are addicted to their craft, you need actors that work with the same type of fervor. Emma Thompson despite not getting top billing gets the most screen time, gets the toughest job, and delivers the ultimate performance. She becomes very dislikable and yet sympathetic at the same time, and it is impossible to see anyone other than Thompson deliver this type of impact. Tom Hanks in an Oscar-baiting year does a superb job portraying the icon planet Earth knows and loves as he gives Walt Disney a humanized performance that separates the flawed man from the myth the Disney Company has feverishly worked to this day to protect. The rest of the cast does not disappoint, and we even see Colin Farrell potentially impress some Academy voters as the loving yet extremely defective father figure.Disney's protection of its brand is the sole reason why Saving Mr. Banks could never ever ever ever ever ever be produced or made by anybody else. But luckily for all viewers, Disney doesn't pull back many punches in delivering the story behind the complex and conflicted making of Mary Poppins. It will be deep in the Golden Globes and the Academy Awards but ultimately indeed deserves the praise—even if you won't see all the details behind the true story on screen.",8,134,166,19 December 2013
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," A New Hope for the franchise, The Force Awakens brings Star Wars back to quality form
","Let's get one thing clear: there is absolutely no way in the modern economic structure of filmmaking and Hollywood are we ever going to get a sci-fi trifecta as good as the original Star Wars trilogy. Just ask Indiana Jones what happens when you try to revive a severely beloved franchise in a new era decades later (*screams in agony*). And with the Disney Regime having their fingerprints all over the product you know there will be limitations, there will be questionable decisions, and the eggs will never be in the same basket.However, Star Wars: The Force Awakens is not just a step in the right direction; its many many steps in the right direction. Despite the impossible odds to live up to the Original Three, The Force Awakens delivers an exhilarating experience that will revitalize your love for the franchise, and will give you strong anticipation for what the future holds within the LucasFilm universe. Although the movie definitely scales back some of the plot for future installments, it is still chock full of surprises, lovable characters, and the Star Wars magic that we haven't experienced in a very long time.J.J. Abrams revs up the nostalgic factor by not only doing several callbacks to the original trilogy, but but by crafting a storyline that builds and evolves in similar fashion to the original 1977 masterpiece. Without spoiling too much secrets are being pursued, rising evil is threatening the galaxy, and we see heroes coming from unexpected sources--these are all factors coming into play in Episode VII. Force Awakens actually takes off a lot quicker than Episode IV, but the difference is the 2015 revival slows down slightly to allow for more story lines to build (and not always necessarily conclude within the two hour timeframe). Don't let George Lucas fool you—there were no plans for a sequel back then as A New Hope tossed the entire kitchen sink in terms of budget to give you the most complete riveting experience possible.The Star Wars tropes are all far too present, and some with upgraded elements: our villain is quite menacing, there is a great cast of characters we wish we could spend more time with, the robotic creatures are lovable every second they are on screen, and of course there is the underrated variety of vehicles and weapons and creatures that we see in the Star Wars universe. Those expecting or hoping for a big deviation might be slightly disappointed. The production value of The Force Awakens was mesmerizing, from the battles to the outstanding cinematography supported by the booming John Williams score. Complementing the art direction is the CGI being kept to an absolute minimum (although the film really should have taken a page from Return of the Jedi and reached out to the Jim Henson Company for a few scenes).It paces like Star Wars, it looks like Star Wars, and it definitely feels like Star Wars. The Force Awakens has a major element preventing it from becoming the cinematic game-changer Star Wars was back in the 70s: the planned structure technique of Disney. The 1977 gem was layers ahead of the next best-looking film while simultaneously nearly bankrupting everyone around them. It would change the way we see, experience, and film special and visual effects. It was also a fresh new concept that had a wide open door of possibilities—leading to all the extra books and media filling in the structural blanks. Disney is going on a schedule, is going on strict guidelines (More money was spent on budgeting then the film itself if that's saying anything), leading to less power to the fans (we won't be seeing dozens of Star Wars books like in the past) and less attempts to ever fully finish the story. Love or hate Disney, they know how to keep a property from becoming stale but profitable.Can The Force Awakens be a better film? Of course, with more time, less limitations, more actually-completed story lines, and a lack of planning of milking the franchise. But Abrams and company still gives us a very entertaining film that begs multiple viewings to witness the new coming, and skim through all the details and potential clues to where the franchise is heading. Star Wars fans should not be disappointed, especially after what we witnessed during the darkest of times being a fan (The Prequel Trilogy).The Force Awakens is a dazzling blend of old-school Star Wars magic with new-school thrills and fresh blood that will revitalize the brand throughout the upcoming trilogy and all the spin-offs that follow. Thank you Abrams, thank you Disney, and thanks to all the participated: Star Wars is back and has removed all the stench of the past couple decades.",8,3,23,18 December 2015
Flight," Even with the reliable Denzel at the cockpit, Flight never takes off.
","Somewhere in Flight, there is a good movie waiting to pop out. Unfortunately, we never really got to see it. What could have been a nice display of the unraveling and the unveiling of an assumed hero becomes the typical drama about a broken man---except with an exhilarating turbulence sequence. Although the acting was fine and the directing was spot-on, the editing was convoluted and the movie was a bit lengthier than necessary. Denzel Washington is one of the most dependable actors arguably in the history of film. So of course, he is the outstanding factor on this film, and kept the movie from becoming too unbearable. He is supported by a great staff that includes the also-reliable John Goodman, Don Chedele, and Kelly Reilly. The movie may have the Lifetime feel, but definitely doesn't have the similar acting. During the darkest moments of the film, the staff delivers and deserves all the accolades it can get. If anything hampers the acting, it's partially the writing but mostly the editing. What really prevents Flight from becoming something special is that it reveals all its cards before having a chance to bluff. Detail scattered in the first third of the movie could have been hidden to not only subtract some predictability but could have also added some suspense and mystery into the movie. Knowing where Flight was going to go just a dozen minutes in was not a good sign. In terms of writing, you must always be one step ahead of the audience, must always have a decent trick up your sleeve if the story ever lingers. Flight being over 120 minutes and already treading down a familiar road from the getgo, there was no way the decent directing from the amazing Robert Zemeckis or the great Best Actor nominated performance of Washington could save this from being a bit of a bore. By the time we get to the finish line, the Zs will start developing in your system. When the most thrilling and most entertaining sequence of the movie occurs within the first half hour and three half hours to go, we have a problem. Mayday mayday, this movie is going down.",5,3,6,22 April 2013
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2," Enjoyable Swan Song of a Legendary Franchise
","Harry Potter has taken moviegoers on quite a ride ever since the original flew into theaters 10 years ago. There's been some decent moments (Sorcerer's Stone), excellent moments (Prisoner of Azkaban, Goblet of Fire), and some miserable moments (Half-Blood Prince). With the final installment, the cast and crew pulled out all the stops to try to deliver the most epic film in the entire saga. The drama, tension, and action were revved up to the maximum to compete with the final book—which was also a plethora of drama, suspense, and resolution. And while the tone still isn't as sinister as the book it's referencing, Deathly Hallows Pt. 2 remains a very entertaining and emotionally-charged finale that wraps up the saga nicely.Just in case you haven't actually read the novel, Deathly Hallows Pt. 2 follows the events from part one as Harry and company attempt to find the essential parts to crippling the strength of He-That-Shall-Not-Be-Named to a point in which he isn't ridiculously invincible. Along the way, major sacrifices are made, Hogwarts is in major trouble, and nobody is safe. Considering how good the original source material is, Steve Kloves' biggest job was to be able to translate it all in a reasonable amount of screen time. Considering that they were willing to split the last book into two colossal films, it shouldn't be too big a problem, right? Kloves actually decided to minimize the dark tone of the final book and cut back on the amount of 'grimness' that was featured in the final third of the story. Adding to that are a few small changes in terms of content and structure. Whether or not this is good depends on how much of a novel purist you are. To me the changes were not necessary, but didn't distract too much. The entire cast was back and all delivered their performances with no trouble. Let me just say: it is a pure miracle that the kids from the original grew up to become quite talented, and it's a miracle that they were able to maintain such an excellent group for all these years. No other movie franchise can ever boast such an achievement. We honestly take it for granted: Alan Rickman, Helena Bohnman Carter, Ralph Fiennes, Maggie Smith, Jim Broadbent, Emma Thompson, Gary Oldman It is honestly the cast that makes this movie work, since they perfectly bring the literary characters to life. J.K Rowling was totally on the lucky side in terms of casting. But enough about that, let's praise the pure amount of effort put into each of these movies. The special effects, sets, background design have been top-notch all these years and did not disappoint in the final act. Every detail from the book has translated well on-screen with barely any controversy. While there wasn't much to marvel at in the first third of the movie, once the final battles at Hogwarts took center-stage, the visuals will leave you breathless.David Yates for some odd reason became the main director of the franchise after the fifth installment—which was not as well-directed as the previous two Harry Potter movies. After his awful sixth installment, I lost faith in him. With Deathly Hallows however, he proved to me that he has learned his lesson. While the movie still paces a bit slow, unlike the last installment the slower moments were still very necessary. The backstories sprinkled throughout the film added a layer of emotion to the movie that we just didn't experience in the previous three movies combined.That being said, the action could have been better. Deathly Hallows has clearly the most battling of any Harry Potter story/film and could have really delivered a battle to the scale of a Lord of the Rings showdown. Unfortunately despite the great special effects and gargantuan scale; the fights themselves felt a little underwhelming. David Yates wanted to give every major and minor character in the movie some screen time and their final chance to say/perform something memorable. And while this does happen, it leaves less room for the wand battles between the dark forces and our heroes. Come on now, after years of torment and years of the destruction of countless innocent lives, Harry deserves at least a 15-minute showdown with his nemesis.Bottom Line: Deathly Hallows Pt. 2 improves over the first, definitely improves over Half-Blood Prince, and is a nice and touching finale to the franchise that the world has grown up with and loved. Prepare those tissues, because the deeper invested you are in the series and all the characters involved, then the more its going to hurt viewing the final half. Everyone did a phenomenal job translating a quite difficult novel into a watchable epic and misses the 'epic' quality by a few notches. The main question now is: what are we going to do in a world without an upcoming Harry Potter piece of work?",8,0,2,15 July 2011
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire," Just like the stakes, the quality of Hunger Games increases ten-fold
","Now this is how you do an adaptation.Catching Fire is a dazzling display of kinetic sci-fi energy that feels more polished, more complete, and more wholesome than the predecessor—which wasn't a bad movie but was marred by limited resources. Francis Lawrence and company wasted no time in fleshing out the issues of the original as they paced this story better, gave it better production value, and learned how to raise the emotional stakes without getting too ridiculous.What makes Hunger Games a success in bookstores is the heavy emphasis on the emotional aspects of the conflicts and also the realistic fiction that allows for us readers and viewers to connect with the characters. Catching Fire manages to re-create the experience perfectly by remaining accurate while never overloading the movie with special effects or pointless action.Our leading lady is also a major player as to why Hunger Games has been resonating with audiences so well. Jennifer Lawrence is once again remarkable as the tough and fiery heroine that is slowly but surely building a cult following within the districts in the movie. The supporting cast also each performed well, especially Elizabeth Banks and Woody Harrelson---but this movie is supported and carried by Lawrence. She deserves all her Oscar credibility.Lionsgate is nowhere near as a big a film company as the major studios like Disney and Warner Brothers. So their all-hands-on-deck routine towards this movie was expected. Their budget escalated, which results in a prettier and more visually stimulating experience. But then there's the other Lawrence that helped propel the franchise to new heights. With the better director, we got to see better action sequences and a better display on the mayhem that is occurring throughout the 140 minutes.But just like all blockbusters with multiple sequels planned down the road, the movie's ending makes the rest of Catching Fire seem like it was just a massive build-up to an exciting climax. With another book at the helm, we surely should have expected it, but it still feels like an incomplete ending.Hey, maybe that's just evidence that the ride was truly enjoyable---it left us wanting more.",8,1,19,25 November 2013
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," The original Hollywood blockbuster. The original blockbuster masterpiece.
","You know this film. You know the characters. You know the music. Why is a review even being written? Star Wars: A New Hope revolutionized and forever changed the game for American cinema back in 1977, and stands tall today as one of the greatest films of all-time. Back in 1977, there was absolutely nothing quite like it: the blend of epic music, incredible sets, spectacular ahead-of-its-time special effects, superb action sequences, and an overall complete package of film-making that before and since has rarely ever been met. You are immersed in a totally different world in a totally different time period, and thanks to George Lucas and the talented staff behind him that obviously gave their all in this movie, Star Wars is one of the 15 best movies you'll ever see guaranteed. For the first time in history, you really felt like you were in an alternate universe in space (Hush 2001: A Space Odyssey fans, Star Wars didn't separate its audience from the subject with ridiculously sublime yet frustrating subtle imagery that never quite explained what was going on).Based loosely off of The Hidden Fortress (A Akira Kurosawa film) and the Hero's Journey outline of Joseph Campbell, Star Wars follows a simple farmboy (Mark Hamill) rising to become a major threat to a rising evil led by the sinister and heartless Darth Vader (Voiced by James Earl Jones). Along the way, he meets the self-centered yet reliable Han Solo (Harrison Ford) and a feisty Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher). Basically, Luke's tale is a hero's journey, copying the same timeline that Campbell laid out for all writers to imitate. Written by George Lucas, it was a script that at the time was presumed to be impossible to imitate because of its lush settings, amount of visual effects needed, and of course, the mammoth sets required (See: Death Star).Luckily for all of us, they delivered. The biggest part of the movie (and the franchise) is how the special effects not only enhanced a scene and brought it to life, but also blended with the actors, actresses, and sets. The special effects were achieved in a variety of ways; whether it is small models (extensively used for the final battle), tricks with lighting, and motion control photography. Industrial Light and Magic, one of the top special effects studios in history, got its mammoth start here. Of course, you need good acting to bring the effects to life, and our main cast does a decent job even when the dialogue is less than satisfactory. Alec Guinness gives the best performance however as Luke's mentor Obi-Wan Kenobi. Last but not least, let's praise David Prowse as the intimidating, powerful, and downright scary Darth Vader. Just imagine having him as your boss.How many other ways can I praise this movie? John Williams gives us the musical score of a lifetime as he combines soft, lighthearted music, with bizarre tunes (like the one in Cantina) and epic tracks that resemble (and outperform) the best of 18th century classical music like late Beethoven and Tchaikovsky. George Lucas, despite his modern-day reputation, established himself as one of the better directors of the 70s with a combination of epic shots with ever-growing tension and mammoth cinematography. While he didn't take the director's seat in the two accompanying sequels, A New Hope displayed his absolute love towards his creation.Bottom Line: So where would we rank Star Wars among the best? We have the acting, the talent, the special effects, the music, the sets, the pacing, the tension, the action, the costume design, and even the puppet work as among the best you'll ever see—especially considering the year it was made. Lucas created an entirely new world for everyone to see, and delivered it with amazing craftsmanship, precision, and detail. The techniques of Star Wars has been copied and mimicked ever since. Surely The Empire Strikes Back would practically perfect any insignificant shortcoming this film had to offer, but A New Hope was the beacon for blockbuster cinema. No longer were the movies establishing this higher-class reputation; Star Wars bucked a trend of huge Hollywood blockbusters with full intention of blowing you away quality-wise by any means necessary.The Annie Halls, Godfathers, Space Odysseys (your pretentious films full of dialogue, symbolism, and feeeeeeeeelings) were now put aside because of your Star Wars, Indiana Jones, Aliens, Terminators, and eventually, your Pirates of the Caribbeans. I rank Star Wars as one of the 15 greatest movies of all-time simply because of its effect on cinema, usage of special effects, and execution of a hero's journey and execution of the handing of a villain. Name a villain that was even close as scary or intimidating as Darth Vader. Now name a movie that has a bigger effect on blockbuster cinema than Star Wars. Can't name one? That's because (aside from Raiders of the Lost Ark) there honesty isn't one. If you haven't seen this movie, it's because you are simply trying to avoid it. If you hate this movie, it's simply because you are trying to hate it. If giving Star Wars a 10 is morally, spiritually, and emotionally wrong, then I shall never want to be right.May the force be with you.",10,1,3,26 August 2009
Deadpool," Cinematic Redemption: Deadpool gets the restart we all deserve, despite the limitations
","Finally we have a decent X-Men origin story with plenty of heart, spirit, chemistry, and good connections with the original source. The baffling thing is that we receive this gift in the form of the most incoherent and random Marvel character in the entire universe. The character that least requires an explanation gets the most structured and most engaging Fox Marvel film since X-Men 2. But of course, the behind-the-scenes licensing drama and the infuriatingly small budget (compared to what the storyline demands) entangle the film quite a bit.Ryan Reynolds might be the only man in the history of film to totally mess up a cinematic character, and then get a second chance at getting it right by starting entirely from scratch. With the rated R guaranteed and a looser approach to Deadpool, Reynolds knocks it out of the park with a much more accurate performance, and one with plenty of depth and sympathetic pull. His chemistry with the rest of the cast reminds you why he's much better unhinged and uncut (Waiting, Adventureland).Reynolds has actually been the main catalyst at making sure that he helped right the wrongs caused by X-Men Origins. He helped fight to keep the R rating, helped increase the (already small) budget to make this a reality, and has helped craft the flood of social media hype. The hard R rating was the biggest requirement in making this film work; the story and mannerisms of Deadpool are not for the faint of heart. Deadpool is far more in the realm of Spawn as opposed to Fantastic Four in terms of adult content.The script is formulaic in nature, but fresh with crisp dialogue, great one-liners, constant shifts in timeline, and plenty of fun sidekicks to be entertained by. Sadly, because of obvious budget constraints, we are treated to only two major action sequences (the first one overshadows the finale by a long shot), not a single major X-Men cameo, throwaway villains, and most of the time being spent on the creating of Deadpool as opposed to the anarchy that follows. 10 years of production hell and dozens of re-writes could doom most screenplays, but Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick do a great job saving whatever was left.The biggest achievement of Deadpool is how closely it resembles the source material and personality despite getting less money. If you enjoy Deadpool in the comics, you'll enjoy him here as well---even if the eccentricity is toned down just slightly enough to keep the plot structured. The action is intense, the injuries are gruesome, the humor is dark and crude, and the movie never really takes itself seriously. Fourth walls go down, it reveals its own production setbacks within the film, and it has this kinetic comic book flavored energy that hardly ever slows.It might be a case of less money = more freedom, but the lack of funding really tarnishes the movie. Part of the glee of Deadpool in the Marvel universe is his wild interactions with other characters, especially the X-Men. But to put Deadpool in the same supposed Marvel universe as the X-Men and then refuse to have any of the popular characters join in on the fun is baffling and infuriating. Even worse is that we have long-unused X-Men like Gambit (especially) and Cable available. In a tragic case of the production team having more faith than the studio itself, the limitations aren't obvious but become apparent once the final act rolls in and you are left desiring more Deadpool chaos.As a risqué, adult version of The Little Engine That Could, this was a comic book film that was supposedly doomed, expected to fail, and was released with minimal hope---only to be saved because of the strength of the Marvel brand, the incredible online/Reynolds marketing campaign, and a legitimate effort to stay true to the source. Great cast, great energy, and great humor is restricted because of Fox and the ridiculous guidelines everyone has been forced to follow since Disney purchased the property. Deadpool can become a successful franchise as long as they are willing to tie him closer to the rest of the X-Men and Marvel movies---and as long as we keep the same dedicated staff. Don't expect pure unadulterated crazy here; but do expect a great blend of crazy, heart, and entertainment---wrapped together in a limited budget.Most importantly, this is much, much better than X-Men Origins: Wolverine.",7,4,14,14 February 2016
300," 300 is all guts, all glory, and mercilessly violent. Yea, that sounds exactly like the battle it was portraying
","Shooting an entire movie using a green screen had been done before, but was perfected by Robert Rodriguez and his crew with Sin City, one of the most stylish films in cinema history. Same strategy for bringing a Frank Miller comic into the big screen was brought into shooting 300. Shooting virtually the entire film using the latest in green screen technology, audiences around the world are able to see yet another one of Miller's highly acclaimed works on the big screen. But, unlike Sin City, 300 seems to be inconsistent in its slick, raw style. Yet underneath the few moments of questionable imagery lie plenty of substance, great acting, fantastic directing, and a really powerful and nicely woven story. Boldly being able to go where previous epic movies just weren't able to go, 300 is another successful Frank Miller comic book adaptation that is sure to please fans and bring in some new ones as well.We have a very straightforward story here: in 480 B.C. Sparta is in grave danger, and their king, King Leonidas (Gerard Butler), isn't about to give up the kingdom without a fight. Defying all odds, he and his really small army of just 300 men take on the most vicious army human history at the time had ever witnessed. To be even more specific, 300 is basically a glorified look at the Battle of Thermopylae. While they all knew how it was going to end, their impact on the impending conflict amassed into a level that not even they could predict. Written by Frank Miller (and painted by his ex-wife Lynn Varley, who also provides the colors in this movie), 300 is not an adaptation but more like a translation (Something Rodruiguez claimed he was doing with Sin City), since it pretty much takes everything from the comic book and transforms it to film.Frank Miller time and time again has proved that he can make a good story, but it is up to others to be able to display this quality storytelling to others in another format. For the most part it succeeds, but then at other times, it doesn't. Zack Snyder deserves the most credit in making this an entertaining film. He plays with the speed of the story and hands it to us in a very stylish manner. The movie goes slow-motion, Matrix-slow even, and then on another instance goes insanely fast. Even better is that he does not hide the fights by zooming in on everyone, there is plenty of room on the screen to see all the carnage, and the well-choreographed fights. There were some epic battles in the graphic novel, and Snyder perfectly transcends it to the screen.The acting is superb as well. Gerard Butler, the main actor, resembles a scarier, more fearful-looking Russel Crowe from Gladiator. The standout star in 300 though is not him but instead his wife, played magnificently by Lena Headey. She proves to be more than just a pretty face involved in a sex scene as her acting stands out amongst the men, just like the queen's personality standing out amongst a nation of males. There is no instance of overacting or under acting, everyone else did a respectable job.300 is gritty, raw, and isn't afraid to throw body parts and limbs at you. It is not as violent or sadistic as Sin City, but it still can make you look away from the screen in disgust. The blood and guts however is not Sin City-style, but resembling more like Kill Bill Vol. 1's final epic showdown. Most of 300's humor comes from the mere disposing and treatment of bodies that lie all over the place, while the rest of the little bit of comic relief in 300 derives from quick and witty one-liners that occur from time to time. It is indeed action-packed, but does have its hint of sentimentality, especially involving the relationship between the king and queen.Where 300 fails is not the writing, the pacing, the acting, or the content. Instead, it's the green screen usage. It is extremely hard to live up to what Sin City pulled off, but 300 still could have been better visually. The fights were great, but when the action slows down it then becomes rather obvious that a green screen was involved. With Sin City, it was like looking into a living, breathing comic book, and you were totally swept in it. 300 on the other hand has its moments in which the green screen usage overwhelms the scene, best examples includes the characters looking into the background, the scenery. With a green screen, you can only use so much of it before it starts looking a bit fake and/or out of place. Snyder's one flaw comes here, when the viewer is forced to look into the surroundings. Rodriguez had a perfect balance between the subjects and the scenery; Snyder did not. The only other flaw, and it's a minor one, is the treatment of Xerxes; supposed to be menacing, instead comes off as laughable with the make-up and the voice that obviously does not match the actor.Bottom Line: 300 is a good film, and is indeed epic, but do not expect it to sweep you away and change cinema for years to come. Sin City set the bar much too high with green screen usage, and even though 300 is action-packed and is heavy with content; its visual imagery just wasn't consistent enough to really awe anyone. Instead, the awes come from the queen, the fights, and well, the fights. While it is nowhere near as bloody and mind-numbingly violent as Sin City, it still is a film that will attract more men than women, even if there are hundreds of buff men revealing almost all their assets. Flawed, but violently fun.",8,11,23,9 March 2007
Pineapple Express," Different, but oh so much fun.
","Most of the problems in the United States can definitely be solved with drugs. With drugs in our system, we wouldn't care about the lack of jobs, lack of morality, warfare, and all that jazz. Okay, so this method of thinking will drive certain political parties up the wall, however, the druggie effect seems to work more with movies. This decade we've seen an influx of films featuring the controversial herbs and spicesranging from good to just plain awful. Cheech and Chong would be absolutely proud of this bucking trend. Now we have the Apatow gang throwing in their ideas into the mix. While before they loosely toyed with drug jokes (40-Year-Old Virgin's random scenes, Knocked Up's infamous mushrooms sequence) they went all out with their next production.Pineapple Express is not just a drug film; its one that meshes comedy with a heavy dosage of action. Then, unlike most genre-twisting films; this one separates the action from the comedy into two different acts. While the first half does have its action, it's totally infused with hilarity. In the second half, the movie takes a more somber tone; the comedy is there, but it's much more subtle as shootouts, fights, and absolute carnage spews all over the area. Not everyone likes the whole lets-change-the-entire-pace-of-the-movie ideal; which is what makes films like Moulin Rouge, From Dusk Till' Dawn, and Kill Bill Vol. 2 hit-and-miss flicks for the general audience. Pineapple Express isn't as funny as one would hope, but its definitely entertaining enough to keep your interest until the end, and let's not forget the wonderful performances and quirky one-liners.The movie follows a court-process clerk that wears disguises and hands out subpoenas (Seth Rogen as Dale) that takes his drug dealer Saul (James Franco) into hiding after he witnesses a cop (Rosie Perez) commit a murder alongside the next subpoena victim (Gary Cole).They have to hide because both of them are involved with a very rare drug, and the cops could easily trace the drug back to them. With all the hiding, they run into a double-crossing buddy, assassins questioning their job, and more complications than you can imagine. Written by Evan Goldberg and Rogen himself, it's easily one of the most original action films written within the past couple of years. The premise was very interesting, and definitely frays away from the typical drug-addict film.Seth Rogen doesn't just provide a grand script, but his performance is pretty good as well. He's never over-the-top yet believable and lovable enough for you to root for him; even when he is at his worst. James Franco's Golden Globe nomination was no fluke, he perfectly fit the role of the irresponsible, not-too-bright, yet reliable druggie. Rosie Perez and Gary Cole could have been more sinister as villains if they had more to say besides what's going on and what their next plan is going to be. Last but not least, we have the awesome Danny McBride providing even more comic relief as one of Saul's partners. While the protagonist side had many good performances and screen time, the antagonist side had a lot of short, small, and underused performances (Craig Robinson, ugh.) The directing role went to someone very few expected; a well-known, low-key indie filmmaker by the name of David Gordon Green. Directing mostly dramas and low-budget simple tales about growing up and all the jazz; he pretty much abandons his roots by going with this kind of movie. Sort of like what Green Day and Metallica did to their music, this total shift of film-making must have alienated some hardcore fans. Despite some questionable moments, Green does a decent job in maintaining the tone and pacing of the movie; until the third act when it looks like a totally different movie altogether. This was a very hit-and-miss decision and while it was entertaining the final 20 minutes; it wasn't up to par with the improvisation and mayhem of the first 80 minutes.While Pineapple Express does contain the writers and actors of the Apatow gang, its definitely a different sort of Apatow picture. Usually, we have raunchy and adult comedy with sentimental value and plenty of heart underneath. Not here. Here there's total carnage, insanity, and an ever-moving plot that seeks no common road. This isn't everyone's cup of tea, but if you are willing to expand your horizons a bit, then you'll have a blast.Bottom Line: Two genres in one, two movies in one, and one heck of a crazy time. Pineapple Express mixes classic stoner comedy material that would make Cheech proud with action that would make younger Michael Bay proud (before he decided to blow up anything that can be built). Rogen and Franco are perfect as buddies on the run from corruption; hopefully we'll see more of Franco now that the Spider-Man days are behind him. While the directing and pacing becomes very uneven in the third act, it's just what gives this stoner flick its personality. Don't expect an entire thread of just comedy, but multiple threads of multiple different genres woven together to create an experience you won't see often. It's not frequent that one year can deliver two great stoner movies (Harold and Kumar sequel was funny as well), but 2008 was full of surprises.Bust out the 'herbs and spices' and 'cook up' a hilarious evening with this 'special recipe.' Wait. Now I'm hungry. I wantWhite Castle.Back to the movie review. Recommend. Thumbs up for approval.P.S. The munchie ordeal continues.",8,13,27,28 January 2009
John Wick: Chapter 2," In action, more is good. John Wick Chapter Two is much, much, much more
","Whether you love or hate Matrix Reloaded, the film wrote the modern successful blockbuster sequel rules:1) Bring back everybody, add a few new faces 2) Jack up the stakes of the conflict 3) Increase the scope 4) Expand the universe and the origin story 5) Go absolutely crazy on the second half 6) Leave the audience asking for more, while promising moreThe Matrix Reloaded has more action, more insanity, and more juicy content than the original. It may not be overall superior to the 1999 sci-fi masterpiece, but it wasn't for lack of trying. We were still thrilled (The Highway Scene remains an incredible work of cinema) and were left begging for more from the franchise. Matrix Revolutions was an utter disaster, but that's another story.Hardly are action sequels better than the original, even the good ones struggle matching up to the film its following. John Wick: Chapter Two however is not only better than the first, but is the best action movie since Mad Max: Fury Road. Chapter Two takes the excellent stuntwork and camera-work of the original and turns it up a few notches with a better budget, larger run time, and oh so much more carnage.Part of the glee and joy of the original surprise-surprise hit was the intriguing premise being intertwined with well-directed and choreographed action. Assassins having this special code and hidden locations where one can interact and be safely tucked away from violence was a fresh spin on an otherwise stale concept of secret assassins existing all over the world. Chapter Two explores this further by expanding past the United States and digging into foreign locale. Although the scope is larger, the movie actually suffers slightly from having to explain the rules and regulations to its audience before unleashing all the mayhem.Action movies struggle the most in balancing content and story, because we see action movies not for the story but for what can be delivered within the script. Chapter Two's opening half is entirely plot-driven except for the sequence preceding the opening credits. Take the entertaining car fight away, and you wouldn't get a gun battle until 45 minutes in. But The Raid 2 also has a slow opening third before delivering some of the best action ever put to celluloid, so the ticking time bomb formula works as long as you fully commit to the chaos. Chapter Two is saved because the twist halfway unveils a dilemma that guarantees a relentless outpouring of action. And boy did they deliver.Once the true conflict actually arises from seemingly out of nowhere, we are treated to a beefy stew of gun fights, hand-to-hand combat, cleverly drawn-out showdowns, and even an Enter the Dragon-like climax towards the end. Just like in the original, Chad Stahelski uses his skills as a stunt coordinator and experience in the action film industry to carve out some killer sequences where the body count is high, the action is easy and clear to see, the sound mixing is top-notch, and lastly the camera-work rivals that of your best sweeping epics. The pacing is consistent, the special effects is kept to a minimum to focus more on stunts, and the violence is gritty and organic. The variety is also great, as we have a concert shootout, a subway battle, a museum chase, and an exchange of bullets and punches in the historical parts of Rome.Keanu Reeves may not win any acting Oscars, but his approach to action movies deserves some mention. In here he does nearly all his own stunts (driving and gun battling included) and garners sympathy as a man that clearly wants to leave his old life while grieving over his loss. Adding to the fun is a good cast of minor characters each with their moment to shine, each with their vital role in the doozy of a flick. Lastly, we are left wanting more, even you though you have to feel for the obviously crappy month John Wick is experiencing.John Wick Chapter Two won't change cinema like The Raid nor will it set a benchmark like Mad Max: Fury Road. Nonetheless it improves upon the original flaws and all because you get a healthier dosage of action-packed fun that is full of variety, creativity, and superb intense precision. If you like your action bloody and raw like the best we've seen this decade (Raid, Raid 2, Mad Max) then you will not be disappointed in the least bit here. Between this and the upcoming Atomic Blonde, it's good to see American filmmakers finally stepping up on their uncut action skills.Blog: https://coffeeandscriptblog.wordpress.com/",8,2,5,17 April 2017
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," The Brilliance Strikes Back
","Prior to 1980, there had not been a movie sequel that quite destroyed over dethroned the original in terms of quality, cultural impact, and everlasting effect. Ever since 1916, when the first movie sequel was born (Fall of a Nation---completing your pointless trivia of the day), there had been very few successful sequels that could stand tall with the original. Of course, there was French Connection II, and Godfather II, but neither of them could quite compare to the original. Enter Empire Strikes Back. Not only did this sequel have a tougher job to live to its original counterpart (a box office phenomenon that would forever change marketing, merchandising, and film-making for generations to come), but this sequel quite frankly did the unthinkable by changing the tone, raising the stakes, and not promising a happy-go-lucky ending that usually associates with sequels. Empire Strikes Back is yet another Star Wars movie that broke the rules of how to make a film and also ushered a new style and technique of film-making.This movie didn't have the expected ending. Not all the backstories and main stories reached a resolution. The bad guys did win. The good guys were doomed. This sort of stuff doesn't happen in blockbuster sequels, but Empire Strikes Back dared to do this. Accompanying the change in pace is an excellent score, superb directing, incredible action, top-notch special effects, and basically the complete package in entertainment. The blend of action, drama, suspense, romance, and humor is among the best you'll ever see in a movie. Not only is it one of the best sequels ever, but it's also one of the greatest movies ever. This sort of movie-making magic just can't be duplicated.Empire Strikes Back is about the travels of Luke Skywalker, Princess Leia, and Han Solo (Mark Hamill, Carrie Fischer, Harrison Ford) as they suddenly encounter a massive resistance coming from the Dark Side of the force. Led by an angrier and less sympathetic Darth Vader, the rebels are suddenly faster, swifter, and smarter in their attempt to control the universe. At the same time, Luke begins his training to become a Jedi knight, only to have his training stalled when the conflict is becoming increasingly dangerous to all his friends. While it is obvious George Lucas didn't have every detail planned out in the trilogy (Example: Leia/Luke/Han love triangle), he had a grand idea as to where the franchise was going story-wise.The strongest part of Empire Strikes Back is like that of the original: the special effects and the associating visual spectacles that transports you to a totally different universe. The film was larger-than-life, as every location is grander and more impressive than the last: beginning with Hoth (and its classic snow battle) and ending with Bespin. While this was Lucas' creation and story, we cannot forget the directing of Irvin Kershner, which was the best of the entire franchise. Thanks to him, the acting here was best, the surprises were best-hidden, and the pacing was at its peak. The two hours breeze by here, and is capped by one of the strongest finishes in any blockbuster movie.All of your regular characters were back and were at their most entertaining here: Han Solo is at his cockiest and funniest in the second installment, Luke Skywalker is at his most heroic (and most foolish), 3-CPO is at his funniest (and most irritating), and then Darth Vader is at his downright scariest. When Luke has to fight him, the only hint of sheer terror in the trilogy occurs then—as Darth Vader pretty much tosses him around like an unwanted ragdoll. Adding to the fear is John Williams' immortal imperial march song, which makes its debut here. The rest of the music in this movie is also spectacular, and should have won the Oscar that year.Bottom Line: This is one of the top sequels of all-time, because it separates itself from the original by changing the tone, and expanding (and improving) upon everything that make the original Star Wars so great: the writing, special effects, directing, costumes, blend of action and comedy, set design, characters, musical score, pacing, and overall fun. Empire Strikes Back outperforms the original Star Wars in every aspect; from the better first act to even the smaller things like the lightsaber dueling choreography. It would be years before we find a blockbuster sequel that can top the original, and that's Terminator 2 which doesn't occur until the next decade.Like I've said about Star Wars, if you have not seen this movie, it's because you are trying so hard to avoid it. If you don't like this movie, then it's because you just don't enjoy good movie-making. Empire Strikes Back is one of those rare movies that can be wholesomely entertaining yet engrossingly deep at the same time. This is borderline-art, and is a sheer joy from the first minute to the last. The Empire Strikes Back: raising the bar for blockbusters and sequels everywhere---too bad there's been so few of them that have matched the same level of quality.",10,1,2,2 October 2009
Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted," Utterly ridiculous. And it works.
","The cinematic franchise known as Madagascar is at its absolute best when the jokes are flying, the action is relentless and exaggerated, and you see more of the supporting characters as opposed to the main four. Everyone in the Milky Way knows that the penguins, Julius, and Mort provide the highest percentage of laughs on screen.So now taking a page from the playbook of Ice Age 3, the third installment stripped away all sanity and logic, removed most of the heart, and increased the speed of the entire production. So what we have here is an extremely fast-paced and random nutty funhouse that is heavy on laughs, heavy in action, and only slows down when the story picks up any sentimentality.Despite the movie moving so rapid that you don't realize there's a plot----don't worry, I will explain it to you. Alex and company are trying to find a way back to the United States before a psychotic animal hunter catches up to them. Along the way they get chased in Monte Carlo, join a circus, and befriend a group of circus animals that has seen better days. The plot is slightly original but still manages to hit all the clichés. But don't worry; it won't bother you too much.Not when Julius has an incredibly bizarre (but downright hilarious) love story.Not when the penguins and the monkeys continue to scheme, beg, borrow, deal, and build their way out of any situation.Not when Mort's big bulgy eyes and random moments continue to thrive on the big screen.And not when you are treated to action scene after action scene that breaks every single law of physics humanely possible.The staff behind Europe's Most Wanted (it's a three-director team, which is why it seems as though this movie wants to head in multiple directions) is fully aware of the power and appeal of the non-main characters---so they gave them more screen time and focused far less on the drama of going home. That being said, it still didn't feel like it's enough. Unlike the support (and their voice actors) the main characters have gone a bit stale; the writing towards them has weakened severely over the years.But as long as those penguins and lemurs continue to exist, Madagascar will remain a delight for kids and a guilty pleasure for adults. And the third time may not be the charm with the original still being the best, and although once again Madagascar mildly flounders in the third act, it's still a ridiculously dizzily entertaining movie that never overstays its welcome—even if the main characters do.",8,1,4,8 June 2012
Sin City," Most accurate comic book adaptation of all time, but not the best comic book film ever
","For decades and decades not a single comic book film has managed to perfectly translate the comic book into the big screen. Despite the fact that there have been some excellent comic book films like Batman, Spider-Man 2 and also Howard the Duck (just kidding) none of them successfully totally translated a specific comic book of a super hero into film. But, in 2005, it all changes when Sin City smashed into theaters and became a surprise worldwide hit. It is a surprise because it is one of the grittiest, most violent films in recent years, and it makes over 150 million dollars at the box office. This film by no means is the best of the movies based off of comic books, but it certainly is the best comic book adaptation ever done. Robert Rodriguez almost flawlessly transfers the graphic books and brings them to life in the big screen. As long as you love Sin City, this film is a must-see. But, if you never liked those books, then there really is little reason to ever consider viewing it.Sin City takes us to a world in which corruption, greed, revenge, rage, and all aspects of the seven deadly sins rule. Rodriguez and Miller both introduce us to a couple of episodes of the graphic and popular comic. The first story is about a has-been cop who does whatever he can to protect an innocent girl from the clutches of a sick twisted pedophile. The second story revolves around an outcast misanthrope who is trying to avenge the death of a woman he slept with for one night, only to realize that is going to be tougher than previously thought. The last story is about an ex-photographer who is trying to protect a secluded area run by prostitutes from the corrupt cops and the mob. The film is presented Tarantino-style, with the plot(s) not exactly moving in chronological order, but it is not as confusing.Few movies lately have had as much star power as this one. Ranging from veterans like Bruce Willis and Michael Madsen to rising stars like Jessica Alba, Clive Owen, and Devon Aoki, Sin City has a very well-rounded cast full of decent actors and actresses. Each person did their role very well, but the big surprise definitely comes from Elijah Wood. Wood destroys his persona as Frodo in the Lord of the Rings trilogy and does a swell job as the creepy, quiet, and deadly Kevin; a totally silent madman whose trademark is glasses that does not allow anyone to see his eyes. Be sure to watch for a small cameo by the creator of the comic book, Frank Miller.The biggest problem with the film is that if one does not like the comic book at all, odds are the film will most certainly not be enjoyed. I was never a really big fan of Spider-Man, but I really do like the movies, because they are action-packed, humorous, and has a bit of emotion running throughout the film. Raimi put his touch to the Spider-man saga, just like Burton putting his touch on the Batman films. Rodriguez did nothing to enhance the film; he wanted frame by frame exactly the way it was envisioned in the grim comic books. While to many fans this is a great thing, to others whom never really cared about Sin City and wanted to see a Rodriguez film is not going to be too happy. This is the perfect adaptation, but it is not anything more than that.Sin City on the technical side is done very well. The visuals sparkle and shine throughout the film, as a matter of fact this is one of the best-looking films in decades. The music is excellent like all Tarantino/Rodriguez flicks, the camera moves at a steady pace, the film is a comic book truly becoming alive. It is violent, seriously. This movie will leave your jaw on the ground and at times looking away from the screen or covering your eyes to not see all the carnage. This is much more violent than any film Tarantino has come out with, even Kill Bill vol. 1. Expect plenty of action and disturbing scenes throughout the entire film, even though there is a lining of humor and drama blended in as well. But, like mentioned before, aside from the choppy-yet-effective editing, the cinematography, and also the visual effects, this is Miller's film and nobody else's. Nobody is adding anything extra to Sin City; it is almost word-for-word, page-for-page the comic book from beginning to end. You are whether going to love it, or hate it.Bottom Line: Props to Rodriguez for showing Hollywood how to successfully take a book, comic book or whatnot, and translate it to film without taking anything away from the original creation. Casting was very good, the direction of Rodriguez is unique enough for this film to work, and visually this is one of the better films out there. But if you do not like the cast of Sin City or what goes on in it, skip this movie, because what you see in the books is exactly what you are going to get. I was never a fan of the ultra-violent stories, but nonetheless did get somewhat a kick out of this movie. As long as Sin City 2 follows the same formula, the regular fans will have no trouble accepting a sequel, but it will be tough to bring in any new fans to the world where sin rules everything. Sin City: Don't expect Desperado, don't expect Kill Bill, expect a true-blue (er, true-black and white) comic book adaptation.",9,0,1,17 October 2005
Spectre," After this entry, its time to shake the Bond franchise, not just stir it.
","James Bond suffers from the Simpsons Syndrome: its biggest enemy is its collectively stellar past, and its refusal to attempt to shake things up often (ironically, the beginning of the end of the Simpsons was a poorly-done shakeup involving the death of Maude Flanders). Bond has been exploring beautiful places and wooing beautiful women for decades, so when the formula gets stale it really meanders deep into the production. However when the franchise flips the switch and alters things while still sticking to the roots, we get cinematic gold. Goldeneye, Casino Royale, and Skyfall are the best of Bond within the past 25 years, and it's for those reasons. Spectre unfortunately fails to attempt anything groundbreaking.Daniel Craig is still fantastic. The cinematography is still top-notch. The directing (when the budget and script allows) is quite good. Waltz and Bautista were great adversaries (but with very little material). But underneath that, we have a Bond movie that struggles to live up to recent adventures. We have a Bond villain that doesn't quite match up to sinister folks of the past. We have a series of locales that had been explored before. And lastly, the producers should have known better then to not bring back Adele after her Skyfall song became the best Bond theme since the 70s. Sam Smith had no chance.What hurts even more is that the beginning was phenomenal, from the opening shot to the opening action sequence that follows. And just like Skyfall, it was so good that the rest of the movie struggled to truly catch up. What instead follows is a more realistic and grounded approach to the expected and familiar Bond formula; and to be honest it used to be effective but the competition of your exotic action movies in European territory has increased significantly---Jason Bourne, Mission: Impossible, and even the revived Fast and the Furious series. Making the movie a rough 150 minutes doesn't help at all either; it even felt like the budget ran out towards the end.The grounded formula was a shake-up to the Bond clichés, but by the end of all this you'll be clamoring to bring these clichés back. You want the entourage of gorgeous vehicles back (as opposed to several helicopter scenes), you want the outlandish villain back (Give me more 1960s Spectre please), and you want the clever gadgets back. As a matter of fact, I want the cool and calm spy back. In Spectre, they cringingly kept referring to him as an assassin—never a spy. It's a slight dialogue mishap but it speaks layers as to what we are currently seeing from MGM's final moneymaker. Remove Bond from the equation and you have a decent summer assassin flick. But as a Bond movie that has seen so many precious films and delightful moments---the past harms the quality.This is the weakest Bond since Die Another Day, another Bond movie that was ruined because it became too formulaic and frayed far from what we saw in the first act. The movie isn't a dismal failure, nor is it a total sequel disaster to the likes of Amazing Spider-Man 2 (Yep, went there). The Bond recipe is all here, but it's been diluted by too much filler and not enough flavor. Trying to connect the recent Bond movies together also didn't help its chances---James Bond wasn't meant for continuity because they can never add up no matter how hard you try. Spectre went through four writers, and the result was still messy.Don't expect peak Connery/Craig Bond, expect more along the lines of late 70s Roger Moore Bond---when it was obvious that change was needed. Perhaps they've run out of ideas with Daniel Craig and Sam Mendes. Perhaps more time is needed between Bond movies (the three great Bond flicks I mentioned had many years between installments). It might be time for that shake-up again. I wonder if Tarantino is still interested",5,0,5,9 November 2015
Her," Her may not win it all, but its definitely the best-directed film of 2013
","Leave it to Spike Jonze to create an expensive sci-fi movie that can still manage its heavy indie roots and tone.Her is a beautifully directed comedic drama that gives a major twist to your typical lonely-boy-meets-girl film. Spike Jonze continues to impress with his ability to keep the audience engaged no matter how unique the scenario is. His biggest strength is allowing you to be embedded within the environment no matter what the circumstance is, whether it's inside the imagination of a child or inside the mind of a well-known actor.The concept here is heavy science fiction, but believable science fiction in the style of Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. Her follows a lonely writer that starts a relationship with an operating device (sexily voiced by Scarlett Johansson) in a futuristic world that lacks communication and intimacy between people as technology has separated everyone into their own little world. The movie paints a future in which the technology makes life easier and smoother, but makes it much harder for humans to interact and seek out their vital emotions.Oscar-worthy performances also help carry this movie. Joaquin Phoenix is absolutely amazing as the nice, shyly vulnerable writer that continues to struggle getting over a past relationship. Phoenix flawlessly displays the raw depression that comes with having to separate from someone you loved and have spent a good hunk of your life with. And then there is Scarlett Johansson who manages to make you forget that she is just a computer program with her voice. Being able to convey all her emotions using just her vocal chords gives her one of the better voice-over performances since Ellen DeGeneres in Finding Nemo.Spike Jonze is the biggest strength, but also its biggest weakness. Although he skillfully directs Her with a dazzling mix of technical wit and Sundance flair, his script misses the knockout punch as the movie lounges in the final act. It is a tough enough concept, and felt like it was a great idea that had trouble coming up with the proper ending. Even with the amazing amount of detail, visual hints, and superb use of color, the wonderful ride ends all too abruptly and a bit too soon.The one advantage of Eternal Sunshine over this movie is that it had a delightful ending that wrapped up the entire story perfectly. For a movie so heavy in detail and dialogue, ambiguity can really stand out and Her does exactly that crossing the two hour threshold. Nonetheless, all the technical work from the cinematography to the art design was flawless. Just like the other Oscar contender Gravity, the visuals and direction more than make up for a script that could have used some polishing.Her is definitely a film that will not win Best Picture because it's a bit jagged for the typical crowd and because of its explicit science fiction atmosphere (Honestly, name a sci-fi movie that won Best Picture), but it clearly stands as one of the best films of 2013 and another display as to why Spike Jonze is one of the best directors in the business.",8,2,6,24 January 2014
Mad Max: Fury Road," Explosive whirlwind of entertainment, no action fan will leave this film disappointed
","So this is what happens when you give George Miller a good budget. Completing a recent trifecta of spectacular world cinema in the action category (The Raid 1 and 2), Mad Max Fury Road not only easily becomes among the top movies of 2015, but arguably amongst the best action movies this century. Two hours of absolute post-apocalyptic mayhem, this is one of the rare sequels that not only stands tall with the originals, but actually surpasses them. What used to slightly restrict the previous Mad Max movies were budget and technical limitations. But in the 21st century, with more money involved, and more resources to tap into, George Miller's decade-in-the-making vision comes to life in the most entertaining and thrilling way. Fury Road may have the Mad Max tag, but his story is just one of many that roam around. The most impressive amongst the cast (Tom Hardy as Max really didn't have much to do outside participation in the carnage) is definitely Charlize Theron, who plays the tough-as-nails woman that jump-starts the action that will preside over the last 100 minutes of the film. Without mentioning too much, Theron (has there been a quieter action career than Theron?) as Furiosa steals a massive armored rig and raises absolute hell as she tries to make it to her childhood homeland with other prisoners. Crossing paths with her is Max, a loner with recovering from his past who also has been taken prisoner. Even though plot isn't usually a focus point in action movies of this caliber, there is plenty of social commentary and feminist themes to stir the pot. While the verbal and storyline aspects are nothing to scoff at, the technical details of this movie is the headlining show here. Nearly flawless, from the art direction to the cinematography to the editing, the apocalypse has never looked so beautiful. The colors pop out at you, and the camera-work isn't shy of displaying the miles upon miles of nothingness that surrounds the characters. It truly feels like the end of the world as you see the small shadowy figures of vehicles maneuver through the layers of sand or see dark blue darkness when the sun mercifully comes down. And then you have the wide array of visually unique characters that look straight out of your pulp comic books (Yes, the guitar-playing fiend deserves his own story). It's a hauntingly beautiful ride. Miller's directing is what makes the movie stand out. The action sequences are intense, relentless, and done with so much precision and attention to detail; you cannot look away from the screen a millisecond as you see the next round of carnage take place. This movie tries excruciatingly hard to separate itself from the pack of normal summer blockbusters, and it succeeds by pacing like a video game; continuously escalating and topping the previous action sequence. The Raid movies also notoriously saved their best tricks for last. And my friends, even if you might be the slightest bit underwhelmed just wait until the final 30 minutes. Be prepared for some of the tightest and well-choreographed action since the criminally underrated Adventures of Tintin (The 'Opera Chase' deserves much more love). The mix of special and practical effects blends in so well you swear you can smell the burning tires. The movie is one big long vehicular chase, and one that never starts feeling stale. Summer may have peaked extremely early, because it will be very difficult to top the vicious joyride of Fury Road. From start to finish, from the top-tier acting right down to the sound effects, this Mad Max installment is the best hands-down, even though Hardy is no vintage Mel Gibson. Not sure what happened to American action filmmaking, but now Australia and Indonesia own the right to claim their country has produced the finest action flicks this decade. If you are in the mood for a highly entertaining yet original action extravaganza, look no further. By the time 2015 finishes, I can guarantee you that Mad Max Fury Road will remain as one of the best movies in the entire year.",9,4,10,19 May 2015
Transformers: Dark of the Moon," The 'D' in the report card full of 'F's
","We are now up to the third installment of the action-packed franchise. Is this Transformers also stupid? Yes. Does it still have stupid characters doing idiotic things? Yes. Does it still have Optimus Prime disappearing throughout most the film and still not being quite as bad-arse as his cartoon 80s days? Yes. Is Michael Bay still dropping the ball as director? Yes. Does the franchise still not know how to have a decent ending? Yes. And finally, does it still have this overgrossing obsession about the military? Yes. Despite all this, we have clearly found our best entry in the trilogy, as Dark of the Moon mixes the humor and heart of the first, with the utter carnage of the second, while jacking up the ante in terms of conflict and suspense. That being said, it is freakin' frustrating to watch sometimes.With Dark of the Moon, we follow Sam with a new girlfriend but no job and a frustration of not advancing far in life despite saving the world.twice. In the meantime, the Autobots and the Decepticons race to discover the secrets of a spacecraft that had crashed on the moon many decades ago. This discovery will lead to the most haunting conflicts in the franchise as well as a multitude of surprises and twists and turns. Unlike the first two scripts, which didn't really pack anything juicy other than action scenes, Ehren Kruger's script actually does a great job fixing the Megan Fox dilemma while adding a dosage of much-needed heart with a much more likable cast of characters and less of the embarrassing stereotypes that we had to suffer through in Revenge of the Fallen. The stakes are much higher and the film never really drags along with unnecessary scenes. The final battle did take a while though.......The special effects have always propelled this franchise during the dullest of moments, and they shine once again with Dark of the Moon. If this doesn't get at least an Academy Award nomination, I will be extremely disappointing. Action junkies, you will definitely get your money's worth as a major city becomes a massive battlefield full of nasty destruction and pure mayhem everywhere. In the meantime the Transformer fights, while (once again) minimal, deliver in the visual department. That being said, it was odd to change the blood of the robots from a dark color in the second to a clear red. Not quite sure what they were trying to pull off there. That little note can be pushed aside as we see a gigantic building get torn in half literally and fall on top of another building.The cast in the third was the strongest, and it's mostly because of the small roles. While Shia LaBeouf actually disappointed a bit, the Megan Fox replacement (Rosie Huntington-Whiteley) didn't do half-bad with the minimal material she was given. In the meantime, check out the talent in the small roles department: John Malkovich, Frances McDormand, Ken Jeong, Leonard Nimoy, John Turturro, Patrick Dempsey (okay, so the last one might be pushing it, but he did well. Honest. Despite being a really...stupid character). Of course, the parents once again weren't in the movie enough (Kevin Dunn, Julie White) and pretty much disappear way before the climax.Here is where the ball is dropped: Transformers 3 is a pretty stupid movie. There is some heart, some soul maybe, but no smarts. Without spoiling too much, some of our characters (heroes and even villains) just make some dumbfounded moves and utterly questionable decisions that defy logic. And then, Michael Bay, once again, falters as a director. He does indeed have a knack for explosions and military-based scenes, but the robots fighting each other (yet again) are sometimes hard to distinguish. And then he does some very questionable things lake fading the screen to black far too many times (in one instance three times in a small scene that wasn't even necessary). I miss 90s Michael Bay, when he kept the action close and crisp, but never too close to a point of getting a headache. He got the carnage and destruction scenes right, but once the action picks up amongst those robots, it becomes a frustrating game of Where's Waldo.Bottom Line: Transformers: Dark of the Moon is the best of the three films, but that's still not saying too much as the direction is still shoddy, I still don't care about Shia LeBeouf's character, there is plenty of stupidity sprinkled throughout, and it still just doesn't have the quality factor of the better summer blockbusters we've seen over the decades. While the casting, writing, and special effects improved, we are still treated to strong potential not being met. The main villains (and coolest robots) are still idiotic and reduced to cameos, as Optimus Prime once again does his 'I am going to disappear for a while and then re-appear later to kick some arse' routine. If you are a Transformer fan, you will probably appreciate this much more, as the transformers (while some reduced to cameos) visually look amazing, and the chaos they create is incredible on the big screen. But if you are looking for quality, you may want to peek elsewhere. For some mindless fun, look no further.And be happy that this is far better than Revenge of the Fallen.",6,0,2,1 July 2011
The Pursuit of Happyness," Will Smith and Will Smith Jr. propel this dismal tale of poverty full of gritty realism but an overload of drama
","Watching the Pursuit of Happiness, we were looking for the main character's pursuit of happiness as well. In other words, this is a very harsh film, very brutal in terms of reality and the way life is without the luxury of money. Thanks to a stellar cast, good direction, and a nice script, The Pursuit of Happiness is a good film that is hard to look at just because it's so tough, its so hard to see. This trait serves as a double-edged sword, as the realities need to be displayed on movie screens more often, but it comes at you so often that it becomes harder and harder to watch, and it drags a bit in certain moments. Nonetheless, this is a must-see for anyone that needs a little inspiration, of for anyone that might be taking their life for granted.The Pursuit of Happiness follows the gloomy life of Chris Gardner, a struggling salesman losing money, and losing the respect and the love of his wife, while at the same time worrying about the future of his son. He is forced to move constantly, at times doesn't even know if he'll have a home in the evening, all in the meantime he is trying to sell dated products and also attempt to become a stockbroker. With the odds against him, Chris fights for his pursuit of a good life for him and his son.The best part of the movie comes from the writing. The writing team crafts a script in which it showcases the true, true victim of the story; not the main character Chris, but his son. Chris' son, named Christopher, is shown as the one that suffers the most, as his future is seen in jeopardy, his mental and emotional status at the brink of destruction, and hope in his life fading away very quickly. Steve Conrad's script also displays that it wasn't just the world ganging up on Chris, but Chris making bad decisions as well. Last but not least, it's not a bitter social commentary with hidden propaganda; people are poor and starving for a reason, and the rich are enjoying the fruits of life for a reason. Chris soon realizes that pursuing happiness relies on constant determination and maintaining optimism.Will Smith delivers his best performance of his entire career as the under pressure father. Already proving himself in action, comedy, and romantic movies; Smith surprises with a heartbreaking and emotionally-moving portrayal of Chris Gardner. His excellent chemistry with his on-screen son can be traced to the fact that it's his real-life son, Jaden Christopher Syre Smith, who also gives a decent performance for a first-timer. Unfortunately though, acting isn't consistently great, as the wife, Thandie Newton, gives us a very mediocre presentation. One nice surprise is Homer Simpson acting; Dan Castellaneta has a role as Alan Frakesh, one of the big boys of the company Chris is trying to work for.This film's biggest strength also turns into its biggest weakness. While it is indeed incredibly realistic and can perfectly tear out your heart, the barrage of unfortunate events just continues piling up. Then, with a running time of almost two hours, it starts to drag and can hurl people towards immediate depression. Humans can only take so much bad news at one sitting before reaching for a sharp object. To top it all off after so much drama, sad, tear-jerking moments, and instances that force you to wipe the tears from your face; the movie is over. When the opening credits last longer than the conclusion, we have a major problem.Bottom Line: Excellent script and good acting is barred by poor editing, a long running time, and an ending that comes almost at the blink of an eye. Will Smith gives the performance of a lifetime, his son excels as well, but the story is far too sad to be inspirational, which is what Smith and his cast was not aiming for. Kudos for the tough, edgy look at the homeless life, but with a third act that was dragging, the appeal starts wearing off. Cutting the length, leaving out some of the bad events from the movie entirely would have improved the film, and made it a bit more motivating. Advertised as a dramedy, and comes off more as a gloomy drama than anything else; which is both a good and a bad thing. The Pursuit of Happiness: A story that isn't life-changing, but is a decent example as to what can happen to your life with a bit of effort and perseverance.",7,1,2,24 January 2007
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," Top-notch adventure masterpiece, The Last Crusade raises the bar and remains one of the best films you'll ever see.
","Of all the franchises in the history of film-making, not a single one boasts a better third film than The Last Crusade. Of all the sequels in this Earth, very few can quite measure up to The Last Crusade. This film set and raised the bar for all adventures following it—a bar that not a single film has yet reached. Indiana Jones becomes a movie legend with the third installment. This movie has it all: action, comedy, adventure, mystery, horror, romance, and a perfect way to end a nearly-flawless trilogy. The Last Crusade is not only an amazing sequel, but ranks in my list as one of the greatest films of all-time. Without exaggeration, this movie fires on all cylinders, hits all the targets without question, and quite frankly certifies Steven Spielberg as easily one of the greatest directors in the last quarter century.It has all the elements of an incredible motion picture: likable characters, quality acting, amazing action set pieces, superb stuntwork, amazing direction, clever and deep writing, a perfect musical score (John Williams), nice cinematography, and great pacing. This movie is underrated because it's never quite mentioned in the same breath as other Spielberg classics like E.T., Raiders of the Lost Ark, Jurassic Park, Jaws, and Saving Private Ryan. Last Crusade did a beautiful job wrapping up the trilogy by dwelling into Indy's past, and tying him to his father that long-eluded him.In The Last Crusade, we find Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) once again traveling overseas in search of the Holy Grail, a relic that for hundreds of years has eluded the most stubborn of archeologists. Along this journey, he also sets out to find and reconnect with his father. This adventure takes him through Italy, Austria, and Hatay. He also encounters Nazis, massive rats, under-the-radar religious cults, a man that is centuries old, and even runs into Hitler himself. Jeffery Boem writes the script of his life as he weaves a clever tale that contains many religious and family undertones underneath the massive adventure. This film was much lighter in tone than the second installment, and covers much more ground as well.Harrison Ford IS Indiana Jones, it honestly is hard to imagine anyone else fill the role. While River Phoenix does a swell job portraying his younger self, this is Ford's film for the running. Equally as impressive is Sean Connery has Indy's father. The two share a delightful mix of tension, awkwardness, and humor as they try to put up with each other's antics and methods of survival. All the other small roles were done exceptionally well, with special kudos to Denholm Elliot as the hilarious Marcus Brody. In James Bond fashion, we have a different leading lady for the third time in the franchise, and Alison Doody does a great job combining feminine toughness with a bit of vulnerability.Steven Spielberg runs this show and runs it perfectly. All the action set pieces were crafted and executed beautifully, with the best ones being the opening train chase and the epic showdown on the desert involving the German military tank. On both scenes mentioned above we see some of the best stuntwork in the history of film, especially with Indy jumping to a moving tank on horseback. Name a stunt from recent years to top that one. And whenever action and adventure isn't happening, Spielberg keeps the tension and suspense high, even when the two Indys go at it in humorous fashion. The scene when Indy is in a Nazi rally is one of the more tense moments you'll ever see, with the stakes being absolutely high and the result potentially chaotic and disastrous.What I dislike most about movies nowadays is that there is way too much reliance on special effects and CGI. While it does create shots and images that you couldn't imitate without computers, it also cheapens the look of the film and prevents it from ever becoming even remotely realistic. With The Last Crusade, the only reliance on special effects came in the final sequence, with the first two acts focusing on stuntwork, massive sets, and clever camera tricks. This prevents Indy's third outing from ever being over-the-top, and resembles classic adventures you would find in old-old school comic books. That's what Indiana Jones is, a down-to-earth comic book hero always on a quest for adventure, history, relics, and answers. To this day he remains one of the coolest creations for cinema in history. His name is now synonymous with adventure, peril, and quality film-making. It is such a shame the franchise didn't end on the now iconic final shot because of the extremely disappointing fourth installment. The fourth just didn't have the grit, humor, quality adventure, and delightful subtle religious weight of this film and the original.Bottom Line: One of the greatest films of all-time and by far the best movie of 1989 (highlighted by big summer flicks like The Abyss, Ghostbusters II, Batman, and Lethal Weapon 2), The Last Crusade overpowers the second installment by leagues and is right underneath the original as some of the best adventure/action film-making you'll ever see. There honestly isn't a single major flaw in here, as everything from the directing to the exceptional musical score was done beautifully. While Spielberg and Lucas have taken a different approach to film-making in this decade and leading up to the next, there is no denying what a powerful force they were in terms of success and quality back in the 80s. If you enjoy movies, it is your duty to watch this one and enjoy its epic adventure and pulp mayhem. If you want to make a good adventure movie, this is the film you must go by. Cinematic perfection is something that few movies achieve, and fewer franchises can achieve more than once. Indiana Jones and The Last Crusade fit both billings.",10,4,7,18 December 2009
Goodfellas," A Gangster's Life For Me
","1990 was a decent year for movies. We have the now-Christmas classic Home Alone, tear-jerker classic Ghost, several decent action-packed flicks (Hunt for Red October, Total Recall, Die Hard 2, Steven Segal before he became ridiculous), and of course, Rocky V (totally kidding). But, 20 years ago, there was one movie that truly rose up amongst the usual pile of movies and delivered one of the most exhilarating experiences in the history of cinema. Goodfellas is a masterpiece of its genre, and would change the movie world forever. It was too intense for some, but if you can rise past the grittiness, you are in for a wild ride through the drugs, violence, humor, and money associated with life in the gangsterhood. This movie would change a genre forever, and would pave the way for several promising careers.Much like the way Sergio Leone (and eventually Clint Eastwood) made classic westerns (For a Few Dollars More being my favorite) that made all the other westerns made at the time inferior, Goodfellas made The Godfather and all crime/mafia pictures look silly. That's right, I said it. Godfather is a decent flick, but it is no Goodfellas. Nowadays, whenever you make a gangster movie, you aren't borrowing details or techniques of Coppola, you are copying good ol' Martin Scorsese and his masterful directing style associated with this flick. Even television shows have a lot to owe to Goodfellas--—The Sorpranos features over 25 actors and actresses that were in the movie. Easily the best film from 1990, and easily the best crime-film of all-time.Goodfellas follows the lives of several gangsters and their families throughout multiple decades, as you see their rise and fall in terms of position, power, and money. All of this is being narrated by the main character, Henry Hill (Ray Liotta). What separates Goodfellas from every mafia/gangster film before and since its release is its very humble, down-to-earth presentation of its story. While The Godfather made the mafia life a larger-than-life event with a God-complex, Goodfellas toned it down and made it look like a gritty, blue-collar lifestyle that pays well and provides plenty of benefits. Also, unlike all gangster films at the time, Goodfellas didn't just focus on the main players, but also focused on the wives, mistresses, kids, and families of the gangsters involved. It was a family affair, and this was a realization that Scorsese and Nicholas Pileggi clearly pointed out in their excellent script full of crisp diologue and plenty of substance.Another great thing about Goodfellas is that gangsters, bosses, villains were all given a heavy dosage of human character. They were all people you can relate to, they weren't just existing and talking to progress the plot, they engaged in deep conversations about subjects that were not always related to their job. When the audience can associate themselves with the people in the film, it's a great connection, and few films can connect better than Goodfellas. It never feels like a film that is 146 minutes long.Complimenting the superb writing was the phenomenal acting. Every single performance was excellent, from the small (Samuel L. Jackson) to the much bigger roles (Joe Pesci, Robert DeNiro, Ray Liotta). The excellent cast of actors and actresses contributed mightily to the powerfulness, and the humbleness of the movie, as it humanized the lifestyles of mobs, gangsters, and the mafia. Even the rampaging murderer Joe Pesci portrayed was likable because despite his rage and murderous attitude, you can still feel his admiration and care for some of the people around him.But the standout feature of Goodfellas has got to be the phenomenal directing of Martin Scorsese. Prior to Goodfellas, there was not a single director that perfectly mixes long shots, close-ups, track-shots, freeze-frames, long takes, and gritty hand-held-like cinematography like Scorsese. The movie lacked the long, artsy, pointless sweeping shots of most gangster films before 1990; not a single shot or scene of Goodfellas was unnecessary. For example the wedding scene of the first Godfather went on for too long because of its constant shots of the wedding events; now compare that to the epic long tracking shot of the main character entering the Copacabana. The action and the mayhem was always close-up, sometimes with a gun pointed directly at the camera, as if it was right on your face.Bottom Line: If you enjoy a good film, then Goodfellas is for you. If you have not seen it, you are missing out on one of the greatest displays of perfect directing in the history of film, and easily the best crime film you'll ever witness. From the writing to the acting to the music selected to the flawless mix of style and substance, Goodfellas set the bar much higher for films of its kind, and all adult films overall. It's one of the first modern Hollywood films to not have that Hollywood touch; as it remains down-to-earth, and allowed for a similar R-rated crime masterpiece (Pulp Fiction) to flourish a couple of years later.While the general public usually ranks The Godfather as the quintessential crime film, I am one of the few that will safely say that The Godfather is overrated, and it's because movies like Goodfellas exist. This film is very realistic, very intense, and full of so many spectacular moments, you'll need multiple viewings to truly embellish yourself in it all. This movie is literally only one scene away from cinematic perfection (the infamous Last Day as a Wiseguy scene ran just a bit too long). I strongly recommend this movie, as it will change the way you watch movies. And if you are aspiring to be in the film industry, it will change the way you make them.",9,0,0,20 September 2010
The Proposal," More than you would expect in a romcom with a rehashed plot.
","The Romcom is a genre that becomes increasingly easy to craft, but as the years go on, it's a genre that is liked less and less by critics of all ages. Unlike the genres of action, sci-fi, and even comedy, the amount of ideas for a romantic comedy become quite limited. You can only find so many ways to make people fall in love before you realize you've seen it before. In recent years, romantic comedies rely much more on star power and chemistry rather than storytelling; since the story is probably something done before in dozens of other movies, romantic novels, television productions, plays, musicals, etc.In this decade, the most lucrative romcom hits emerge because of the main actors and their interacting with each other. Movies like Hitch, What Women Want, He's Just Not That Into You, Sex and the City, Knocked Up, and How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days used big stars, big names, and lavish productions for successful profiting. The Proposal does the same exact thing: they took a story we all know (and females love) and pitch it with two likable, bankable, and attractive stars. Add a dosage of beautiful scenery, strong supporting staff, and cute animals, and viola, there's a hit arriving. Yet, for the second time this year, we have a repetitive plot being saved by delightful performances. Just like He's Just Not That into You, it's a predictable ride, but an unexpectedly fun one.The Proposal is about a stern, cynical, and seemingly heartless boss (Sandra Bullock as Margaret) blackmailing her young and hard-working assistant (Ryan Reynolds as Andrew) to marrying her to avoid being deported. In order to prove to immigration that they are indeed going to marry and it's not a ploy, the new couple heads to Alaska to meet Andrew's loving family. Throughout the trip, the fake couple learns more about each other than expected; and as the plot twists and turns, sparks start appearing. Like I've said before, we've seen this tale before; it's not a groundbreaking tale that will change movie-making forever.Instead, we rely solely on star power and the supporting cast. Despite the age difference (and the movie experience difference), Reynolds and Bullock have a nice bit of chemistry together, and play off each other's tricks and subtle jabs perfectly. Bullock is very talented, but yet seems to have found a comfortable groove in these romantic comedies, and it is quite frustrating considering her performances in Speed and 28 Days. Reynolds proves that he can mold into different types of roles, as he was a comic book character just a few weeks before this movie's release. Check out the star power behind the support that was not advertised: Craig T. Nelson, Mary Steenburgen, Betty White, Malin Akerman.Yes, the clichés are present, yes left-field moments do occur (and since when do they not in romantic comedies?), and yes, you can predict where the story goes. Fortunately for us, Disney (in its marketing), and the director Anne Fletcher does a fantastic job hiding the surprises sprinkled throughout the 107 minutes. The surprises range from plot twists, to totally improvised moments in which you can't help but chuckle at the absurdness. Fletcher doesn't dazzle with clever shots or beautiful cinematography, but did do a fantastic job maintaining The Proposal in the PG-13 range with several scenes, especially concerning a nearly graphic yet hilarious moment that must have ruffled some feathers in the censorship department with the nudity involved.Bottom Line: Once again, I am surprised by a chick flick, and can't help but actually recommend the film, even with the flaws attached. Star power, like in all the good romantic comedies of this decade, is what carries and drives this film away from mediocrity and keeps it afloat even whenever the movie drags the slightest bit. This isn't going to win awards or become analyzed for years to come, but it will improve any gloomy evening with its comedy, chemistry, and overall lovable personality. Loosely shut off the brain and memory of previous flicks, and you'll have a good time.",7,1,5,22 June 2009
The Simpsons Movie," Nudge this surprisingly good movie somewhere between the 90s Simpsons masterpieces and the episodes of this decade
","10 years ago, it would have been safe to say that The Simpsons was the greatest American cartoon in the history of television. For several years, we witnessed instant classic after instant classic back when the 90s ruled. However, as the series continued, the quality declined a bit, leading to mere overexposure of the franchise and a constant yearning of a return to the old days. It constantly gets promised that The Simpsons will return to the glory days and prove the die-hard fans wrong but every year despite the occasional success lies disappointment and letdowns. However, with that being said, The Simpsons remains one of the best cartoons of all-time, and a movie was inevitable. But, with some of the creative staff of the past decade gone and ideas running out (400 episodes does indeed eventually create writer's block) can the movie even come close to what it used to be? Can we get a movie that will install catch phrases, controversy, and conversation sparkers all at the same time? Will The Simpsons Movie be able to stand on par with 'Homer at the Bat,' 'Marge vs. the Monorail,' 'Who Shot Mr. Burns,' and 'Itchy and Scratchy and Poochie?' Believe it or not, the answer is almost yes. The Simpsons Movie is high and mightily above the modern-day episodes of the cult hit television show, yet barely ranks below the episodes of the 90s. Nonetheless, it is an entertaining flick that will not only please the die-hard fans, but will potentially bring in some new ones. The concepts in the movie we have seen before, but it doesn't matter because in here we have an interesting plot, plenty of one-liners, less emphasis on gags, obscure visual humor, good running time, and even a bit of heart. What is lacking in the adult cartoons of today (Family Guy, Simpsons, South Park, all the Comedy Central garbage) is the hint of sentimentality, which was one of the reasons why the Simpsons moments of the past were so wonderful. This wasn't just a throwaway popcorn flick; there was a good dosage of content that explores why Homer Simpson is such a bad father and why Marge can put up with it. Despite it missing the rich, extremely clever humor and commentary of the 90s Simpsons, The Simpsons Movie is a step in the right direction for the franchise.The plot of the Simpsons Movie is a medley of past plots intertwining with a new one; Springfield is being isolated from the rest of the country because it has become so polluted, which turns out to be the fault of Homer Simpson. After they escape the Springfield dome, Homer is given another chance to show the family that he isn't a deadbeat loser. But as time drags, it's become apparent that Homer is not a good leader, a good father, or a good husband, even if the intentions are there. Can Homer Simpson prove his worth or will he be doomed to be separated from the rest of his family, the only people that understand him. The social, political, and/or cultural commentary isn't there, neither is most of the satire, but instead we have a plot-driven Simpsons episodesomething that usually doesn't happen. This concept is almost foreign to Simpsons fans but it works because we have plenty of jokes to move the story along.While the usage of characters may trigger differing opinions, it gets the job done. The Simpsons Movie is indeed about the main family, but almost every other character throughout the years of the show have their moment to shine and make a memorable moment. There is a lack of exposure to the Springfield fiends Mr. Burns and Sideshow Bob, and there isn't enough Duffman (Then again, is there ever?) but this is made up by enough running time of every other minor character, and very little emphasis on guest stars (Counted only one band and one celebrity). The voice acting like usual is top-notch, but we need to congratulate Julie Kavner for her portrayal of Marge Simpson, who in this movie reveals her broken and vulnerable side, resulting in the saddest moment in the film.Some can claim this is nothing more than a cash cow, but The Simpsons Movie is more like a celebration of all the great years in Springfield, (*insert state*). If you are fast enough, not only can you find the hidden jokes mentioned earlier, but references to past Simpsons episodes (Look for the broken-down ambulance). This extended episode doesn't take many jabs at pop culture or competing cartoons like it used to, but it's the one-liners and excellent visual gags that make up for it. Also listen for a surprisingly good musical score by Hans Zimmer. While this is more like an extended episode of the television show (Kind of like The Spongebob Squarepants Movie years ago) it is a darn good episode to watch, and worth the money.Bottom Line: The Simpsons Movie is an extended episode that surpasses that of recent seasons and just misses the mark when compared to the classics. Instead of a multitude of plots combining together with satire, wit, and commentary like in the 90s, we get a straightforward plot full of gags that hit the mark and one-liners that will most likely be repeated multiple times for months to come. Everything that's made the Simpsons one of the most successful shows ever is present here. You will be left thirsty for more time, especially so we can see more of Springfield and its crazy inhabitants, but that does not make this movie disappointing in the least bit. Unlike the latest couple of seasons, The Simpsons Movie will not let you down. Grab some Buzz Cola and some Krusty Os, and enjoy another chapter in the long-running success of the cartoon that changed the animation world forever.",8,2,7,29 July 2007
Up in the Air," Up in the Air is a decent flight with an extremely rough landing
","There is nothing pretty about the current economic crisis out here in the United States. For whatever the reason (and this will be a totally separate argument), most of your small and big businesses are dropping people like unwanted flies, and at a very dangerous rate. To find any sort of charm or humor in all this is extremely difficult, yet Up in the Air manages to loosely pull it off. This film is a charming little adult movie about a man's job and his unique lifestyle. The third film from Jason Reitman is entertaining; full of great acting, but like Juno stretches the running time just a bit much. Slicing a major portion of the movie aside, Up in the Air is fun to watch, and provides a lot of insight into today's cruel business world.Up in the Air follows a businessman (George Clooney) whose job is to fly to different parts of the country, to different businesses to fire people when the actual bosses do not have the guts to do the job themselves. This sort of life requires cynicism and a lack of personal connection. But, his boss (Jason Bateman) hires a young and up-and-coming businesswoman (Anna Kendrick) that develops a way to fire people without all the flying. Before the new technique of terminating people takes place, Ryan takes Natalie on a tour of how his business life is. Along the way they run into a beautiful older woman (Vera Farmiga) that starts a casual relationship with Ryan. Based off of a novel by Walter Kirn, this movie's screenplay was written by the director as well, with some added touches by Sheldon Turner.Jason Reitman's best ability as director is pulling excellent performances out of his cast. Whether the roles are small or large, every actor and actress did a fantastic job in this movie; and let's not forget the sympathetic performances of the people that were fired in real-life. George Clooney once again shines in his new-school Cary Grant-like performance as a man with a lot of vulnerability, but hides it in his charm, suave cockiness, and winning smile. Vera Farmiga and Anna Kendrick are strong female leads that went toe-to-toe with Clooney and did not disappoint. Kendrick, being so young, was the more impressive of the performances by remaining very likable in spite of her tough personality. Keep an eye out on J.K. Simmons for his fantastic few moments as a father of two getting fired.In adult dramas like these, the writing is pivotal in propelling the acting performances and the realism of the entire piece. Bateman heads back to the typewriter after directing someone else's decent script with Juno. Just like in Thank You for Smoking, the plot was simple, but dwells much deeper into the motivations, mannerisms, actions, and reactions of all the characters involved. The dialogue was great, some of the conversations were slick and hilarious and not one work was put out of place. Up in the Air also has a share of great one-liners and monologues.The directing of this movie was nothing special, but gets the job done. There are some wonderful shots of the cities featured and wonderful sights above the skies, but the directing is mostly focused on human emotions and pacing of the conversations and revelations. In the first two-thirds of the movie, it works out well. The movie paces itself nicely, and was entertaining, even when some scenes were heartbreaking (Firing someone always leads to emotional moments). And then came the final third.Falling into the trap of most decent movies that have trouble wrapping up (Cast Away being my personal favorite example), Up in the Air begins to stumble in the later scenes when Ryan tries patching up old wounds. These elongated scenes slowed the pace a bit, lost its clever bite, and even contradicted itself a little in terms of content. When the career didn't become the focus of the movie, it became a bit jarring and stale. Then by the time the plot shifts back to the career, it becomes very rushed, and the ending appears right around the corner. The resolutions fly in out of nowhere and before you know it, the credits are rolling. Some of this might be exaggeration, but in a movie where dialogue runs rampant and action is limited, off-screen major events was not expected.Bottom Line: Up in the Air was fun, entertaining, lightweight dramedy for the adults. That is, until the final third when the movie shifts a little, and then bolts towards the exit. The only blame for this change of pace was the editing team and the writer—which happens to be the director. Movies do not have to run two hours, excellent 90-minute movies can indeed occur (Up, the best movie in 2009, was a mere 96 minutes). If Up in the Air had paced itself to be such a length, it would have been a much better film, supported by slick dialogue and fantastic acting, with a hintage of subtle criticism and clever commentary on current events. Unfortunately, we have a misguided third act that was a fraction as good as the first two acts. Overall Up in the Air is a decent film, but nothing fantastic or Best Picture Nominee worthy.",7,1,2,9 June 2010
Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby," If you get a kick out of Ferrell stabbing himself to prove that he is paralyzed, this film is for you
","If you don't chew Big Red, then **** you. That's just one of the several humorous one-liners that are sprinkled throughout the silly and sometimes downright-hilarious Talladega Nights. Powered by a stellar cast and more product placement moments than one can count, this film spoofs the sports drama genre and also spoofs the sport of Nascar. Will Ferrell provided his writing skills as well as his acting chops, but it's really all the acting in the film that keeps Talladega from running out of gas. More or less, this is the Nascar version of Anchorman, except for the fact that it does not borrow jokes from other television shows.Talladega Nights is about a hotshot driver by the name of Ricky Bobby (Will Ferrell) whom with the help of his best friend, a fellow Nascar driver himself, he rises to the top of the racing world, and along the way marries a beautiful women and has children that could have been spawns of Satan. But, his success is short-lived when Jean Girard (Sacha Baron Cohen), a really good driver from France, moves to the United States and gives him a run for his money. Bobby's driving skills, devotion, and courage is put to the test as the new threat charges his way to conquer the racing world. Written by Adam McKay and Will Ferrell, who worked together on Anchorman and Saturday Night Live, they leave plenty of room for improvising and random moments of humor, and oddly enough those scenes are what delivers more than anything else.Quite frankly, where the writing and directing and pacing fails, it's made-up for by the acting. Whether it's the awesome improvising skills of Ferrell, John C. Reilly (portraying his best friend), Cohen, or even Michael Clarke Duncan (Yes folks, he is actually funny), it is guaranteed that the best moments of the film involve them just playing around, having fun, drifting off on very silly tangents; which includes interpretations of Jesus and deep dark secrets. The races themselves are well-directed, credit should be given to McKay for at least providing a share of in-your-face moments when the crashes lunges right at the camera on several occasions with enough realism to almost temporarily suck out all the humor at the moment. The soundtrack in the film is actually very good, as it mixes some AC/DC, Chicago, and even some Saliva. Good soundtrack, plenty of good one-liners, plenty of off-the-wall humor; the last time a sports comedy successfully mixed this together was The Waterboy, an Adam Sandler hit years ago.Unfortunately though, like most comedies, even spoofs, there are those slow moments that just slow down the film to a point in which its almost unbearable. The relationship between Bobby and his father is thrown in, and despite the father being a fairly funny character; he gives Talladega Nights a hint of unnecessary sentimental value. Then there are other moments in which they are spoofing dramatic moments from other films, so it is confusing as to when the movie should be taken seriously, if it should ever be taken seriously. You'll even get to see Duncan in tears, but thankfully that was during the best moment in the movie.Bottom Line: One-liners up the ying-yang carries this movie from reaching certain doom, and also might even inspire a second viewing to catch all the witty dialogue exchanged amongst the more talented improvisers. Don't let the product placements fool you either; they are all there for a reason. Ferrell is a whiz at entertaining the audience, but it is not just him making the audience laugh, most of the supporting cast lent their comedic chops and with plenty of success. While the film could have been shorter, and also could have done without the family theme, it is still worthy of viewing on the big screen at least once. While the summer is ending, the barrage of good summer flicks in the 2006 season has yet to end, as Talladega Nights will not disappoint as long as you are a fan of Will Ferrell and are not expecting Frasier-like sophisticated humor.'Shake...AND bake!'",7,1,4,7 August 2006
Furious 7," Bloated but still fun, Furious 7 is brain-eliminating popcorn entertainment with nice dramatic touches
","Imagine your favorite food. Let's use pizza, because 99% of the world loves pizza. Imagine a nice big pepperoni pizza. Always a good decision right? The cheese, fresh sauce, crisp pepperoni, nice crust. Now imagine that you pile nine pounds of pepperoni on top of the pizza. The ingredients are still good, these are still your favorite toppings, but the result remains overkill. That is Furious 7 in a nutshell: way too much of a good thing that results in the most ridiculousness and implausibility in the entire franchise. And yes it is indeed entertaining but for the first time we are seeing special effects totally overpower practical effects and the result is a movie that comes straight out of summer blockbusters as opposed to being a gritty and stunt-filled extravaganza like what we have been seeing in previous installments.If you are a fan of the recent string of franchise-altering movies, then you will be entertained here. Just know that Fast and the Furious peaked with the killer bank vault scene from Fast Five. Within the two hours of Furious 7 there will be elongated fights, massive car chases, and purely insane action sequences that forces you to remove your brain temporarily. Mixed in nicely with the carnage are the consistent themes of family and love---plus the now-famous final scene that will trigger emotions that Fast and Furious had never dealt with before. Paul Walker's passing gives this movie a haunting edge, as even some of the costume choices and dialogue ironically singled out Walker long before his actual untimely death.The cast is mostly back, although I do find myself missing the Don Omar/Tego Calderon combination. Vin Diesel and The Rock are at their toughest, Paul Walker is the perfect partner, Michelle Rodriguez continues that tough chick streak, and of course there's Ludicrous and Tyrese (whom we forget are music artists) working their comedic magic. We have now three villains they have to look out for (remember my comment about overkill?) but Jason Statham is the one that delivers the strongest punch as he mixes espionage with muscle.The movie paces and runs like a music video: combining gorgeous women (to a point of pure misogyny), gorgeous cars, lots of speed, plenty of quick cuts, and lots of slow-motion shots. James Wan quickly developed a knack of combining music video eye candy material with an abundance of testosterone-laden carnage seamlessly. He is far removed from his low-budget horror days. However this day and age when action buffs have become accustomed to Gareth Evans (*raises hand*), it's slightly tougher to digest the fights and chases that occur here without feeling the slightest bit underwhelmed.Furious 7 is more of the same, except so much more it really doesn't leave much for the eighth installment. After parachuting from a plane while inside a car, what on earth is there else to do? Fast and Furious has had a fantastic run but with each installment trying to top itself every time it will reach a point in which every scene becomes laughable. When the audience is chuckling and giggling during a serious action sequence, it's not the right reaction, even if the audience won't regret the money spent to get in.If you are fine with the Fast and Furious series drifting farther and farther away from the lower-key, more urban original flick that started it all, then Furious 7 will entertain you, thrill you, and leave you smiling. If you are looking more for a return to roots, a more realistic approach to vehicular action, run away from this movie. Furious 7 isn't the best, but it's definitely the biggest, and definitely the most emotional of them all. The stuntwork (when actually used) is fantastic, the directing is slick, and it accomplishes what it's set out to do. And lastly, Paul Walker despite his untimely departure cinematically gets to leave in the perfect time.",7,0,12,9 April 2015
