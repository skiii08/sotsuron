Casablanca," 'Of all the gin joints in all the towns in all the world, she walks into mine.'
","Ever since I first saw this film years back, I wondered where all the praise came from. Then I realized -- movies with figures of huge importance are widely regarded as masterpiece material.Citizen Kane has a man of large wealth and power. Casablanca has a widely respected night club owner. The Godfather has mafia kingpin Vito Corleone.Why is it so interesting for us to see men in power? I think it's because subconsciously we connect with the feelings of power - and in a way ride the American dream with these dreamlike images. These movies are true cinema - as it was always intended to be. The acting, the score, the dialog, the staging, etc, etc ... it's all great. As Rick fades into his first flashback with Ilsa and Sam hammers away at the piano we realize that we've now experienced something.
The direction is slow and methodical, as I like for it to be and I honestly believe this is cinematic art -- much different from painting art on a Hollywood palette. This is the kind of movie that will change the way you dream and has one of the widest known film quotes ever: 'Here's looking at you, kid.'The only thing that drags down the score is the over-hyper customers that often annoyed me. This doesn't detract much; but it's still there and I felt it improper when the rest of the flow is so formal.A-: Good film experience with screen legend Humphrey Bogart giving his best performance. Those who are easily annoyed may need to bear with this one, though.",9,0,1,30 July 2003
Citizen Kane," 'I don't think there's one word that can describe a mans life.'
","So sayeth Charles Foster Kane -- a bigshot stock-holder who is arrogant and cynical. But this is what interests us; not the honest american making his way through honest methods -- we like to see scandals and heart-ache. It enthralls us.What made this film important was it's narrative, which transcended typical movie fare and pioneered new age film-making. The visual trickery and camera mastery is so apparent. Welles created this at age 25 -- I applaud him.This film is artistic in its direction, but it's story is much more poignant, even today. One thing I remember off the top of my head was the cockatoo that lacked and eye - it squawked and then dissolved. Leaving John Q. movie-goer wondering what the deal was with this one. So, this guides us into looking deeper. There are moments of apparent visual trickery - and then there are moments of genius subtlety. The shadows that often look so really are often hinting at something behind the eye, something we have to feel instead of see. Is this the best ever? I don't think it bests The Godfather, but I think it runs a close race and dismisses other classics with ease.A+: A grand achievement that will long be remembered. Hollywood directors should focus more on deeply intimate stories instead of their regular tripe.",10,4,6,30 July 2003
We Were Soldiers," Mediocre, on level with signs.
","***SLIGHT SPOILERS*** Just not enough depth; as we saw with mel's latest. this movie is just brain-numbingly mediocre and the dialogue can be memorized in one sitting - as it rarely has any asides from the commands. Gun fire and death does not make a movie - a movie is made by its context and its social significance; a movie is good when it relates to one in the way it was intended to do so. i really dont know what this movie was supposed to do ... entertain us? didn't do that. I just kept waiting on something sad / dramatic to happen; never came. worth a one night rental but i wish i had my $19.99 back so i could buy the special edition of Se7en (which is farly superior to the movie in question here) Signs didn't really have a purpose... the movie pace was awkward and it really didn't do much for me. the only sentiment that revived the film was the man running over father grahms wife (spoiler?) that and her telling, in her dying moments, for phoenix to swing away; perhaps she knew of the on-coming invasion and what was to happen and it was used through fate that she die so he'd have what she said to compell him to tell phoenix to swing away. average movie, not ground-breaking; worthy of a dvd collection.Not horrible, but it sure as hell isnt groundbreaking. Want a decent war movie? rent full metal jacket or braveheart (gibsons best) otherwise retreat to your mainstream harry potter bs that appeals to the mainstream audience because of the clever merchandising.",7,0,0,18 November 2002
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," 'Of course it isn't only physical! I deeply respect you as a human being!'
","Being a fan of Kubrick's for some time before seeing this film I had mixed expectations; Kubrick is known for his savagery and brutality behind the camera. But, could he do a comedy? I bought this film sometime last year (it came in the Stanley Kubrick collection) and sat down with huge expectations. Although, the first time through I didn't really appreciate it; I thought I'd give it another go to give it a fair chance. The script is what holds this film up over time, I think. Peter Sellers is an extremely good performer and George C. Scott was great, and often subtle while being surrounded by over the top performers. The sets and models of the film are, of course, dated. But, at the same time it's nostalgic to me and I enjoyed it. The direction is always top-notch in a Kubrick film, so don't expect too many innovations that you've yet to see from Stanley, because all of those came with two of his other, and I dare say far superior, films; 2001: A Space Odyssey and A Clockwork Orange.Of course it's funny, but it's subtle humor. If you're a fan of someone getting kicked in the face thinking it's funny -- don't stop here looking for a laugh. If you think Kevin Smith is the funniest director working today -- pass by this one. But if you're a fan of Charles Chaplin and enjoy older, more subtle, humor; give this a look.Also, riding the bomb out of the plane is one of the most memorable moments in cinematic history -- and I'd long since knew of it before I knew this film existed. Rating: A-",8,1,3,30 July 2003
The Godfather: Part II," 'Everytime I said a hail Mary I caught a fish.'
","Oh what an act Francis Ford had to follow! Seriously, under-taking a project such as this must've been extremely daunting. After all, the first Godfather film is no easy act to follow. But, Coppola continued to pay attention to his characters and the locations in which he staged them.Without comparing this to its predecessor it's close to being without flaw. The prequel segments are beautifully done, shot, and staged. The pace is quicker and a lot more happens in this film, but in being the minority -- I don't think it's better than the first film. The parts with young Vito are certainly brilliant and Robert DeNiro gives a powerful performance of an emotionally restrained Vito Corleone.The music is still good, although not as good as the score from the first. The main theme has changed, and I -- for one, miss it and think there's something seriously wanting about it. Yes, it's beautiful; but I don't believe it compares. Al Pacino's performance here is un-rivaled, in almost any film. There are 4 pivotal performances I commend ahead of everything -- and that's: Marlon Brando and Al Pacino in The Godfather, Malcolm McDowell in A Clockwork Orange, and Robert DeNiro in The Godfather II. There are so many great moments in this film. Michael confronting Fredo in Cuba, on New Years eve, is my favorite film of the sequel continuation. Otherwise it'd probably be Vito Corleone following Don Fanucci through the roof tops and then waits for him at his apartment. The light flickers on and off lighting up Vito's face and all you see is ice cold menace.Some film fans like this film without even liking the first one, but I say the first is slightly superior, and only because Marlon Brando's missing and it just doesn't seem like 'The Godfather' without him.A+: A memorable experience.",10,0,1,30 July 2003
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," 'No one knows its here, do they? Do they, Gandalf?'
","Peter Jackson has an epic vision, there's no denying it. Everything we see is on a grand scale and is hurried in and out in the same pace. Jackson doesn't want to stop and become a character study or evolve the characters; he wants to draw us into this fantasy Middle Earth he is so proud of. And since he concentrates on beauty; that's all he achieves.The story-telling is extremely cliche. Especially for a fantasy film. Something is threatening the world and everyone must use their courage to fight the forces of evil. I'm not attacking the film, really, but more the original novel and script. The novels are good fantasy, yes -- but do we really need the same story over and over? I don't think so.The acting is typical fantasy fare; self-important and even self indulgent for most of it's running time ... the actors are the same. No one gives a stand out performance. The actors walk around and meet with other actors, and you can practically see the script when they talk.The cinematography and set designs are lush, but utterly pointless if nothing gives interest in the surroundings. It looks good, yes. It's a grand scale and it's a grand story and a vast achievement across the board. They're succeeded in bringing the Lord of the Rings to life. Ok, now what?The score is good but expected and really doesn't get anxious, or rushed. But, it's no risk style bores me, because we've heard it somewhere before -- typical fantasy fare. throughout it's 3 hour running time. I was taken aback by the harmony of sound and music. This is what made me look past it's flaws and now they're too strong to ignore. The whole movie I feel like I'm waiting on something big to happen, like everything is being built up and readying me for something amazing and yet it falls ultimately flat.Not quite the masterpiece it's made out to be but it's still a good film. But, I hesitate to give it a perfect score for obvious flaws in its screen-writing and acting.C+: If you're a fan of the genre indulge yourself in this visual landmark. If you're looking for strong story-telling and serious acting -- put your money elsewhere.",7,0,0,30 July 2003
The Pianist," Vivid image of a past nightmare
","The Pianist 'plays' very well in many ways. It's a very well directed and scripted story of the holocaust, and as some say; it could dethrone schindlers list as the best. The score is beautiful, the acting is top notch, the cinematography is amazing. It brings you into the film - it makes you feel like you're apart of the survival along with 'the pianist' himself. It's a beautiful story, and very dear to me.10/10!",9,0,1,31 March 2003
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Amazing would be quite the understatement for this wonderful epic of a film!
",I am completely in awe as of now as i'm still trying to catch my best. I was very lucky to see it a private premier; and i walked out in cold chills as did the rest of the audience. Think of the impact 'The Empire Strikes Back' had - and double it ... this is the magnitude of this film. The fantasy and realism mix so perfectly well it's a completely believable the brilliance of the novel is brought to life flawlessly. I'd say much more; words alone cannot do this film half the justice it deserves! Bottom line; 10 out of 10; best movie I've ever seen ... and i've every single DVD on the top 250 and about 300 more and i've been into the art of film critique for a long time. This movie is amazing; this is the second coming of christ metaphorically speaking. Unbelievable and unspeakable magic!SEE THIS MOVIE AND BOW TO ITS GREATNESS!,8,0,0,3 December 2002
Schindler's List," 'Who are you? Moses?'
","Extremely well written drama centered around the horrors taking place within the Holocaust of World War II. But, I don't think the Holocaust is entirely the point. The point is moral choice and the ability to choose freely even when everything around you has gone to hell; and a real hell at that.So many millions lost their lives in the Holocaust, and for that I pay my respects. But is a film good simply because of it's subject matter? Some people seem to think so. But I don't. I think this particular film is good because of it's pace, good writing, good acting, and good music.And surprisingly Spielberg attempts to create a style of his own here; unlike his plagiarizing Kurosowa's action film techniques. It's so subtle, but at times it is highly artistic for a Hollywood director.Ralph Fiennes is brilliant as Amon Goeth - in probably the best performance of the entire film. It's brutal and he takes no prisoners. For which I feel he deserved the best supporting actor Oscar.One nice moral point of the story is conveyed through showing the one little girl in red. In doing this the film suggests not to classify it as tragedy for the millions who died, but in terms of tragedy on purely personal levels for each of those 6 million (give or take) people. Each of them suffered, and each of them are remembered as such.B+: Fans of actors, directors, or material should give it a look. It's worth your time.",10,9,13,30 July 2003
Chariots of Fire," Running out of faith
","Excellent time portrayal and events make this film a must see. The acting is top of the line, and besides - although I dont really know if it should have - it beat Raiders of the Lost Arc for best picture, which is no small accomplishment. It's worth a look, or two.8/10.",10,1,5,24 March 2003
A Clockwork Orange," A real horror show, that.
","As you may be able to tell from my reviews that I expect a lot from any Kubrick offering, as I've only been marginally let down on one occasion by good 'ol Stanley, and that film was Spartacus. It doesn't feel like a Kubrick film to me, and there's not much artistry to it.But, in films like this and his other visual masterpiece Barry Lyndon; art is rampant and it takes a lot to squeeze everything in. So much happens in the course of this film it's insane. It's fast-paced, intense, brilliantly acted and scored.From a board, I've something I said in trying to 'prove' to someone this film was good, since saying the same thing twice would be a bit trivial, I now quote myself; (I'm lazy)Malcolm McDowell's performance is brilliant and energetic while being subtle at the same time. He delivers his lines well without looking like he's reading for the sake of the script. He didn't play Alex -- he became Alex.
Stanley Kubrick's direction is astounding here. More-so than other Kubrick films I'd say. Watch how he conducts his camera so methodically. After the singing in the rain bit (in which Alex sung to the estranged writer) how they walk back through the milk-bar. The camera is first focused on the stairs as the come down it, as they advance towards the camera it begins to back up; after that it spirals to the side and then behind them and follows them. Also, when they first meet with the old man when they're coming up to him all you can see is their shadows cast on the wall before him. Beautiful moments are strewn about everywhere. Such as when Alex is walking home from the milk-bar, to his home (the first time we see it; before the brilliant directed 9th symphony montage as he's going to sleep) and he's walking through an abandoned futuristic court-yard of sorts and all you can hear is a somber whisper. The music is used well in every scene, and sometimes it's to the point where it reminds of the imagery produced by the original disney film Fantasia. I don't have to explain the music being great, I doubt you question that.
The story, to me, is imaginative and brilliant. A writer, writing of his wife being murdered by hooligans is writing a story, the story we're watching, thus he's writing about a writer who's in the book he's writing about writing about the book he's in. It's brilliant because it's a poetic pi; which is very hard to create. The questions on moral choice have given me nice long thoughts at night. Think about it; so Alex was a rapist and a murderer; is that crime enough to take away his humanity by stripping him of moral choice. Stripping someone of their ability to choose is worse than murder. So many things happen within the film, think about it. It comes on and things spiral into the main story. Many many many memorable scenes and they're all done so well. First, they beat up an old man, terrorize the road and then go to the writer's home. After they make their way back to the milk-bar and things continue to happen rapidly. Events pour in and out in a constant and well timed pace for it all. It's more imaginative and unique than any movie I've ever seen. It's one of a kind and will never be copied without complete failure. The Usual Suspects plot has, and will be done, again. Same with these other movies with the 'great twists' at the end. They're just fluff with no moral center, no questions about humanity or anything else that actually matters. A Clockwork Orange is a character study and portrait of evil. The Usual Suspects is a quotable action flick with a 'twist.' The made up language delighted me throughout the film. There's no way you could predict the ending to this film, there's too many possibilities. As for you saying I need to watch mindless action movies -- that offends me. I do, but I dont hold them in too high of a regard. Such as Leon, I watch it for it's mindless action. Like Raiders of the Lost Ark and other action films. I love the stupid flick as much as the next guy -- but they dont really matter to me. They're not art -- they're just entertaining portraits. Art is something that makes a statement. The one reason people rate this lowly is because I think people get other ideas of what the ending should be; and as sporadic as this film is, I don't believe there's anyway to predict the ending.A+: Anyone who appreciates film as an art medium should experience this.",10,1,2,30 July 2003
The Shawshank Redemption," 'There's something inside they can't touch.'
","Let me review this film on two aspects: it's merit and it's high placement.
First of all, ask yourself this question: Is a film great simply because it achieves? I hope many think this is not the case. Shawshank has a slow and methodical pace. Along with good performances around the board. The simple staging and lighting of the film is over-done in it's simplicity and I personally see no art in it at all. But, I'm not saying it's a bad film. It's not, and it's far from it. But to be ranked over vastly more intelligent efforts is a sad reflection on our society.
The writing is top-notch. The best thing about the film is the flow of the story, and I could have simply read a book. I am no huge fan of visual effects or quick paced story-telling ... but I am a fan of art. Reading a book would be as enthralling as watching this film. Seeing the acting is like watching lines being delivered, but being delivered well.As for it's rating on the site ... the film pushes no boundaries in which film often offends people to the point of disliking it. It has a nice uplifting story at the end and presses a lot of hot buttons. Including murder, infidelity, and scandal. Searching for the soundtrack for this film is what brought me to IMDb for the first time, actually. So I dare not say this is a bad film; I only say it's ranked higher than vastly superior films.Rating: C+",7,4,8,30 July 2003
The Godfather," The definition of epic.
","The entire scale for this movie is huge, and every scene carries emotions with it. The acting is amazing, as is the score and direction. So, what's wrong with it?SPOILERS FOLLOW
First of all, people get their hopes up so high when they see this film that, it's to the point, if it doesn't change their life it's considered to be boring and dated. But, also, people also down vote it when it threatens the popularity of their trendy LOTR flicks and other movies that make you 'cool' if you like them.Acting - Brando was so subtle and yet had such a dramatic impact on the way acting was done. I have images from this film that I remember, and mostly I remember Brando holding the cat in the opening scene. His voice has influenced modern film and television - as almost every show on television has paid homage to the father of all film. Score - The score is haunting, and somber in all aspects of the word. It builds emotional tension and it has a pay off. The main theme is amazing and is beautifully put together and is always in the right context when it shows up in the film. It's beautiful, and I strongly urge you to get the original soundtrack.Direction - Francis Ford Coppola took a very subtle and consistent approach in bringing this film to life. Think of Michael in the diner with Captain McCluskey and Sollozzo, as the train is perfectly timed in going by, before Michael (in Al Pacino's career making performance) explodes with rage. It is so apparent in his face, and we feel as he does -- nervous yet we still anticipate. Story - The script is very well written, adapted from the brutal book by the brilliant Mario Puzo. The story of the film was ahead of it's time - and it still is. While being played on television today there are still people who refuse to like this simply because it's hyped. They try to go against anything that's popular in an attempt to look cool. It doesn't work - so give me The Godfather over Pulp Fiction (and all of the hip crime film copy cats that it spawned. i.e. The Usual Suspects [which is ranked higher than ON THE WATERFRONT] -- what is wrong with our society?)
Everything is perfect as we become immersed in the world of the mafia boss Don Vito Corleone, and we're along for the ride as well follow him through a few years of his life. This film changed the way I saw art within movies.
Yes, I hated it the first time I watched it. But, for some reason, felt I should watch it again. On the second viewing it was confirmed; I hated it. I trashed it everywhere, including on this site, and made it sound like the worst movie ever made. Boy, how much I've grown. I trashed it because I didn't want to be caught up in the frenzy this movie has produced. It created a whole spawn of copy-cats and followers trying to capture the art as The Godfather did, and sadly, it will never happen. This will never be duplicated or surpassed in any sense. From start to finish I am completely captivated at the imagery, the music, the brilliant acting, and the underlying script that holds so much warmth, and brutality.For any true fan of film - do not hate this simply because you want to be 'different' from others and look like some sort of outsider since you went against society by not liking a great movie just to prove how original you are. Face it, you're not original - you're doing the same thing others have done when it comes to this film for years, and as I once done as well. All of these kids who hate this film will have the hip movies in their best of lists, and you can figure out their personality from reading them.Their lists will have these films on it:The Shawshank Redemption (another reason why people try to hate The Godfather; Shawshank is their favorite film and it burns them inside to see The Godfather best it in the top spot)Fight Club (hip and trendy, violent and against society. What more could an angst filled teenager want?)LOTR (The scenery is beautiful, but turning everything into some sort of contrived melodrama because the script calls for it is ridiculous; this is by no means the best film ever made. It's a flavor of the month that will die out as time goes by and people realize the acting is horrible.)Etc, etc, etc. It seems like it's cool to dislike The Godfather films because it makes you look like some sort of 'rebel.' Trust me, Spock, it doesn't make you look like you're cool; it makes you look very stupid.
So many people have given this film a '1' in voting. How in the fudge? The music was awful, the acting was awful, the direction was awful? I highly doubt it. Anyone with an IQ over 100 would never say this film deserves a 1.My proposal for a new IMDb rating system, based on categories.SCORE: 1-10 [1 = awful   10 = excellent] ___10___ (KEY)
 ---------------------The Godfather:Acting (leading) 10, Brando changed method acting forever and, in this role, plays the most memorable film character to ever grace the screen. His voice only deepens his enigma. Respect this man.Acting (supporting) 10. Coppola got wonderful performances out of his mostly amateur cast.Score: 10. It's at the same time haunting and beautifully done.Direction: 10 easily. This changed American films forever.Script: 10. Written with brilliance, sheer brilliance. The story is brutal, and so is this ambiguous adaptation.Replay value: 10 -- this film never lets go of me, and has my eye from the very start. I could never get bored watching the masterful acting come from every character in the movie.There, and I average it up and get my rating of: 10. ------------------2 Fast 2 Furious:Acting (leading) 4. I've seen worse, but not much worse. Words are repeated so often it feels like a cheap video game.Actor (supporting) 5. Tyrese gives needed comedy, but still needs to watch some good films.Score. 1. Awful, tries too hard to market itself towards an ignorant mainstream teen audience.Direction: 3. Some of the scenes are decently choreographed, that's about it.Script: 1. Totally forgettable. The dialogue is stagnant and brings absolutely nothing profound or new to the table.Replay value: I'd never watch the film again. It brings nothing new to the table and is stupid.Average that up. If someone gives 2 Fast 2 Furious a 10 for ACTING -- they don't deserve the pleasure of being able to relate to the majesty of the best American film ever made; yes, that's right: The Godfather.
If you don't like it the first time -- watch it again and force yourself to not get bored. If you make it through the second time (it's an acquired taste) think about it, think about the profound story it expresses, the emotions it throws into scene after scene after scene, inviting us to consider, and even feel, the pain they are all going through, and the love and happiness they often share with their, you guessed it, family.Don't like this movie? I'll make YOU an offer you can't refuse: a hip trendy blow-em-up-shoot-em-up flick with no moral value and no merit at its core.
Score: perfect all down the board, this film could never be topped. To me, the only films that come close are Apocalypse Now and Rashomon (in the woods - Akira Kurosawa)But, before you trash this film -- do what I did: give it an honest chance and forget the hype. After a while you will realize the hype was there for a reason, this film is amazing and will continue to be looked at as the best film to ever be made, regardless of what anyone has to say about it. Say it's dumb, say it's long and boring, yeah yeah yeah, you've got ADD, go watch commercials. They're easy to understand and yet so informative. If anyone actually thinks this movie deserves more than a 6 in rating it is disturbed. No professional film goer (someone who has seen over 100,000 films) would EVER say this movie was horrible. Goodfellas is just a mundane rehash of everything The Godfather had already perfectly portrayed. It's a good film in its own right, but could never match The Godfather. Sure, it's hip -- let's get some of that so people will invite us to the mall so we can check out the latest ORIGINAL clothing that everyone else that's trying to be original is wearing! Oh, a shirt that says 'you laugh because I'm different, I laugh because you're all the same.' What a wonderful paradox; there's a million cliche'd teenagers out there wearing that shirt now, thinking they're original for doing it - but yet it's a mainstream shirt that everyone has. Come on kids, watch some good films.",10,3,7,4 July 2003
