Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Enjoyable, great Visuals
","This movie was great in terms of visuals, specially the city planet Coruscant, and the underwater city of the Gungans. The story did have logic and I can sense the direction in which the story will be heading in upcoming episodes II & III.As I recall from ANH, Obiwan took upon himself to train Vader now the young Anakin Skywalker. Some words from Yoda in TESB, about Anakin: who took the easy path to become a jedi. It would be interesting the path to self destruction or how someone can influence a good boy like Anakin towards the darkside..Honestly, I would like to see: LAWRENCE KASDAN to do the screenplay for the next 2 episodes. He actually wrote for TESB, and ROTJ, and also for Raiders of the Lost Ark. Lucas should collaborate with Kasdan regarding screenplay.I would like to see IRVIN KERSHNER (who is still alive) to direct episode II. He had done a great job with TESB..Also I hope to see the great STAR DESTROYERS, TIE FIGHTERS, Y-WING class fighters in upcoming episodes, and more of SPACE BATTLE, and of course speeder bikes.In Phantom Menace, I would have liked to see more of Coruscant in details, or more of Naboo.. and maybe more of space battle and those battle droids on speeder bikes. The spaceships presented in TPM is not very impressive compared to Star Destroyers, and some of the space ships were just a fleeting glance.Oh BTW, I would certainly like to see the Millenium Falcon in action.. again..=",9,0,0,24 May 1999
