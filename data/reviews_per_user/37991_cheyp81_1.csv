Walk the Line," Walk the Line--Excellent!!
",This movie was excellent. Highly recommend!!! This movie has the best actors and Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon deserve several awards for this movie. They couldn't have picked more perfect actors for those parts in the movie. I bought the movie and will hope to see them win awards for the spectacular acting and movie in general. IF you haven't seen the movie you are missing out on a great piece of work. I give this movie a perfect 10. And the soundtrack is sold out everywhere i go so I would give a standing ovation to Reese and Joaquin for the incredible vocals and acting in general. Two wonderful actors who just showed that they are worth more than just acting..they pulled off singing so perfectly..they sound identical to the original Johhny Cash and June Carter!!,10,0,0,5 March 2006
