Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," A directorial marvel .GUY does it again.
","Amazing plot. Excellent timing of action sequences. Chemistry between holmes and Dr.Watson is amazing. A perfect sequel.Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law are once again a true treat to watch as Holmes and Watson. Their chemistry and interactions are perfect; it's easy to tell that both had fun with the script and with each other. Jared Harris as Professor Moriarty gives a solid performance, as a cold, manipulative, power hungry villain. Unlike Mark Strong in the first film, he is a believable antagonist. Noomi Rapace is a nice flavor as Madam Sim.Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadow' delivers as a great, action-packed, and a rather humorous, popcorn loving flick. Note: the dog dies again",9,0,1,29 December 2011
