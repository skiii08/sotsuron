Conquest 1453," Nationalism
","I really didn't expect that in the 21st century someone makes this kind of film. It's without a doubt medieval fundamentalist nightmare that makes you wonder if contemporary Turks actually support this kind of behaviour. It's one thing to admire your past, but it's completely other thing when you don't acknowledge the tragedy of any war but actually cheer for one side like it's the Nazis on the other. The film explains the motivation for attacking Constantinopole by the words of Prophet himself! Nine hundred years before he started the idea of conquering Constantinopole! Really disturbing in so many ways, that after centuries some people's minds haven't moved in the more human direction. I hope this the movie doesn't represent feelings and attitudes of today's Turks.",1,36,68,20 September 2012
Hereditary," Not that good
","The hype may be real - for eleven years olds. Maybe I'm getting old but this movie, as well as many more contemporary horror films, is just not that great. A couple of decades ago even mediocre movies payed attention to some details of the plot, people worked their asses off to make the scene look better. Now, when a couple of movies a year just look ok, nothing special, just like someone actually got to his job and made something from 9 to 5, you get Hereditary - something that would be mediocre twenty-thirty years ago. So yeah, I gave it a 7, it's ok, don't call it a masterpiece, don't say it scared you, unless you also state you're eleven years old.",7,0,1,28 August 2018
The Babadook," Best ending in a long time
","Several reviewers said that the last 15 minutes were disappointing. But they're the greatest part of the movie! Sure, it's not some generic, idiotic horror, it's more complex than that, horror is a tool, there's so much layers in the movie, and it's actually a debut, first full length film by this female director, which is also important, considering feminist themes in the movie. The end is ambivalent, it's not one-sided pro or anti-feminist, it goes deeper. A debut with a 30.000$ budget, I mean, what else should anyone say when they hear a 30.000$ budget, and the film looks great. A director has to be given a chance to make more movies. Of course it's not a masterpiece, but for God's sake, if you watched Insidious, Conjuring or Annabelle than you've already wasted 5 hours of your life, and Babadook is definitely not a waste.",10,7,16,2 November 2014
Mad Max: Fury Road," Fishy Road
","Allegory about how big bad Immortan George Bush got enormous power (gas, water and bullets), became totally crazy, and someone needed to stop him! And one-arm Hillary Clinton stepped in! The Next President will manage those resources in a better way! Not!Of course, a bunch of girls escaped from a guy who gave them all the fancy clothes, not to mention the wax. And when they realized the feminism without hairy legs is immposible in the Green Place, they knew they have to go back for the wax, clean water and soap.Now one-arm Hillary will manage all the resources, the Gas town and Bullet farm. And you know what they say, bullets don't kill people, gas kills people!",1,22,46,7 June 2015
