Source Code," Good movie
","Source Code is a very good Sci-Fi movie which has come up in the recent years. The only thing which I feel could've rated this movie down is its ending part, where the hero sends a text message to the lady in charge in reality from inside simulation of a code to the real world. Thus, it gives a sense of feeling to the audience that its actually a time travel. In a particular scene in the movie, Source Code is described as a time displacement. Its not a time travel. But the last scene of the movie confuses the audience totally. Rest apart, all parts of the movie are really thrilling and exciting. Worth watching and you'll enjoy this movie like anything.",6,0,1,16 February 2014
