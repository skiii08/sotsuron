The Blair Witch Project," MMmmmmmmmyyyyyeeeeessssNnnnoooooWweeeeeeellll...
","To begin with I kind of liked it(Except for the end). Then I digested it for a while and found out it not as good as it seams. Why? Well I'm only human, and as human I easily get influenced by commercials. I think this movie sell on marketing and not on quality. It has been done before and the whole thing was a bit shallow. Never-the-less it's better than the other crap... So I voted 6.",6,0,2,26 October 1999
American Pie," SEX!!!
","And with a headline like that more people will read this comment, and sex is what make this movie popular. I can see their point, but it was just too boring. Sexual debut is something which is always funny to talk about, I was therefore disappointed that this movie did such a poor effort. Some funny elements, but too few. To the movies defence , I think one must know about American high school graduation. Being from Norway I can't understand the big fuss about prom night . All in all dull. Virgins will have no fun with this movie. And if you while watching felt that you learned something, have another father-to-son talk.",3,1,2,11 December 1999
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," It didn't look any good.
","Hmmm. I've seen a lot of Asian movies, a lot of Hong Kong martial arts from the 70's 80's and the 90's. I generally like drama but also love martial arts films, as well as Japanese Anime.  I know about Chinese myths, so I don't mind the over dramatization with long flights thru the air. BUT, it didn't look any good. It looked stumbling, not graceful. It was to slow. Actually the one time it looked good was the first time we only see a shadow darting through the roof. Some of the fight scenes looked Ok, but not the best I've seen(Tai-chi, Shoulin Monks, Judo Saga...).
 When it comes to the drama of this movie, it stumbles to much. A mediocre love story. Not a very good plot. And the film change it's rhythm on numerous occasions. Something which make it seem uninspired. The filming, colors, costumes and settings are as almost always in Asian film, superb... But most Asian films(who are obtainable in the west) have this quality. People who will love this film are the people who have never seen an Asian film before, who likes action and do not mind subtitles.
If you have seen good Asian films before, you'll only think it's ok. . . . .. . . . . . . . .  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .I think... ;)",5,0,0,24 January 2001
