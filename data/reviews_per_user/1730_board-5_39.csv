The Rock," Amazing.
","This film has a great message,what makes the film more original and emotional.The great action-scenes, has enough power to keep the story moving.The characters has more details like you may think.The acting is very powerful,and not just in the main roles.This film is the sign of Michael Bay-s talent,but just a sign.The earlier Bad Boys,and the films he made after this film,are far not good as this film,or just the scenery as good as in the others,but the film-the drama is far not.I hope Michael one day will return to this kind of film making,and stop making sex-lesson teenager,PG-13,jokes,without real good original story,and emotionally ending with a great score(not like in The Island)",8,2,2,21 October 2007
Mission: Impossible III," Could be
","I did not feel like it was 126-minits,this is a very good edited movie,with nice and exciting action scenes.There's no too much new ideas in this movie.Oscar winner Philiph Hoffmann can not play his role,maybe it's the directors mistake too in a part, but Tom Cruise plays himself again ,Maggie Q had not too much time, she is just pretty but not too good,if it's question of time maybe Billy Cradup is better,but I almost can not recognized him, cause he had very strange face,and I don't know why.Lawrence Fhishburn can not step out from the shadow of the Matrix,but he's not wrong.You won't remember for the others next day.The screenplay have big mistakes and holes.This movie could be much better, maybe if it's directed by David Fincher.",3,0,0,28 December 2006
Minority Report," Weak !
","Spielberg made very good films in 70-s,80-s,90-s.For example Duell,Jaws,AI.This films had good screenplay,(I think the screenplay is the soul of the film,not just the director)Washington,2054.3- special human type,with some scientific help can see to the future,and help for the special police force (called Precrime)to catch killers ,before they can kill anybody.Philip K.-s novel for now days become average ,bilt from used elements,can not take my attention.SPOILER ALERT !Tom Cruise sometimes help us to feel what does it mean when a almost perfect system want to catch you ,after he was the boss at the company,but the screenplay was horrible for me.",3,1,3,18 December 2006
Memento," Forgettable,poor.boring,not what I waited from Nolan.
","Absolute forgettable acting ,directing and screenplay,horrible executing,there's only just one memorable word -on ,or no.Boring,there's no REAL ORIGINAL STORY,just the director wanted to drive us crazy.I almost can not remember to a scene ,but the first some minutes maybe.After I had seen this film I had to realize Magnolia-from Paul Thomas Anderson was a great film.Cause that film has memorable scenes ,sentences,good acting,good ,and original twist.But that film has it's mistakes ,but don't want to show things,situations in a confusing, unusual ,too strange way.Nolan has far better films like the smart Insomnia, Batman Begins,and the interesting The Prestige.",1,7,17,21 September 2007
Zodiac," Average.
","Finally I found this film average,or just a little better than average,if you are a Fincher fan .Personally I always have a little bad taste in my mind when I know, now I will see a based on a true story type of film.This time it's very clear the earlier (almost 5-not-video version of the story),did not take BIG STARS,and this was the only reason to made this film,with a big star director who has enough charm to make the audience excited.The film has strong documentary style,average acting,what is not bad ,but not over acted,just powerless ,but realistic.The twists has not enough power,to build that atmosphere we enjoyed in Seven.",Null,0,1,4 October 2007
The Prestige," Fails in lot of levels.
","Spoiler alert!Christoper Nolan did not know this,or did not wanted to tell himself:supernatural elements just changing the situation,at all.But if I'am wrong when this is my opinion,why was that twist too important at the end.And that was not a serious twist.Acting:good,the actors are not guilty,they just wanted to earn money,as usually we know females get some sentences,in the old role,OK what could women do in England in that age.The message is acceptable,but this film was not full of joy,I don't know how the novel did,and what Christoper Nolan and he's brother changed while they wrote the screenplay,but this film is NOT A GOOD FILM.This screenplay is not a good screenplay.3/10",Null,1,4,1 May 2008
Lost in Translation," Sophisticated does not mean better.
","This film is not what it would be,and not enough emotional.I just don't understand the screenplay nominations,if this film has a plot,without for example:twists ,two dimension characters,dialogs.The acting is good,but the film has not real, own, new story,they wanted to say maybe this could happen to you.OK you will feel like somebody else did tell you this story.Sometimes the director Sofia Coppola just can not do anything to your attention.Someones says this is a very sophisticated story,and thats why we can not feel ,or see what we want to see or feel on the screen.And I'm sorry this is not a clever film,cause can not create DEEP emotions,and I have to tell you if you want to cry just watch for example:Titanic,Sixth Sence,Gattaca,Terminator2-3,Superman.",3,0,3,24 June 2007
The Bourne Ultimatum," Smart,but boring third part.
","Spoiler here:That sentence on the roof top,from Matt Damon is enough smart for a third part,SPOILER END.The third part of the series is smarter,than the first two part.But not a typical blockbuster as, action film,and a little bit boring in my opinion.The director Paul Greengrass wanted to make a realistic,and logical,action,crime,thriller,but it's destroyed the action scenes,cause the blockbusters usually has more action,than The Bourne Ultimatum has.A big-budget summer blockbusters need more scenery.Acting is good,maybe others can say some more reasons why,or why not.I'am not rich in words,as you can see.I'am personally trying to tell you what was my first impression,about the film.",Null,1,4,5 May 2008
The Hills Have Eyes," Directly long,film,to cover the problem,this is just a remake.
","Alexander Aja made a relative good film with Haute Tension,this is why some American producers were happy to find a director to a remake,cause today this is a fashion,to bring some Europien directors to USA productions.The film directly starts slowly,with typical,and well known jokes of the genre,and than comes some gore,and violence,looks like this is natural in a horror film.Against all of well known horror film elements,for me it was just a boring film,with a message that is not really clear,and cause I have not seen the original,I just can not tell you where is this different like the original,but I can tell you this was boring,and I just can not recommend this movie to you,rather watch Haute Tensione.3/10",Null,1,1,12 August 2009
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," Almost like T2
","Jonathan Mostow had the chance to direct American movie history biggest approved budget film (2003)Terminator 3-Rise Of The Machines is the continue of James Camerons legendary Terminator 2 (1992).I think the supporting cast ,exept maybe Nick Stahl (John Connor)good ,and plays strong their roles.Kristianna Locken very impressive in TX-role.The action-scenes are magnificent.The car chase scene was nominated in many awards ,against that year had big concurrent in Bad Boys 2,Matrix Relodad.Terminator fans are separated about this film ,cause this film is not James Camerons continue.I think Jonathan Mostow thinking different way like James Cameron,but it's does not mean he's work is worst like James Camerons",7,1,2,10 December 2006
The Shining," Stanley also made typical movies.
","As I can remember Matthew Lillard sad in the movie:Scream something like:loneliness makes people sick.Now the situation is similar like the content of this sentence.Jack Nicolson is not a bad actor,but I did not see him play a different character like this time.The writer Stephen King is also guilty,cause he did not recognize it's just boring,and not interesting.The director,screenwriter Stanley Kubrick failed,the film is boring,and formulaic.You can find lot of movies with similar content,those moving,well acted,and directed.This is a poor,mindless film,and maybe the worst Stephen King adaptation ever shoot ed to celluloid.Just watch it only on television.",Null,0,1,9 May 2008
American Beauty," Watch this film while it's fresh.
","Deep and interesting,this film will take your attention,but this film is sometimes little bit funny ,but I can forget this for this good script ( screenplay),and acting.Sometimes this film for me was a little bit calculable,but this did not disturb me enough to wait the end.SPOILER ALERT:The end is a little bit similar like Donnie Darko or My Life Without Me-(that film was not as good as Donnie Darko or this film,I felt like was a little bit empty,but not bad,and very personal)This film is not too visual,but good written film (story)Watch this film alone ,or with somebody else ,this film will makes you think about your life,don't be skin deep,these are important things in your life, I think.",7,0,1,16 March 2007
Disturbia," Typical mindless comedy.
","Disturbia is an absolute cliché filled thriller,but not a psychological thriller,cause,the characters are not visible,cause the director did not realized the dialogs are bad(in most of time).Not terrifying,cause the director DJ Caruso did not used that type of sound editing like John Moore-in The Omen(2006),or Stephen T Kay in Bogeyman.SPOILER:The twist is really not exist,or you won't know for sure which is that.SPOILER END.The acting is terrible,and the characters are not original.As a thriller this film is not boring,just the clichés will make you upset.As a love story it's just less than meet your family.Message:Not.Good news the DVD-version I had seen has not too much profanity.So if you never watched a film you will have a good time.3/10",Null,1,4,1 February 2008
The Machinist," Don't miss out !
","Brad Anderson made a strong mood film with Christian Bale in the main role.This film is half blood art film ,and half blood commercial movie,but very interesting,and emotionally without boring minutes.The story is about a machinist who became very slim cause did not sleep in a whole year.There are two womens in his life, Steve the sex-worker and a another from the airport-café.But I don't tell you more about the story cause it's maybe the only weak point of the film.You will understand what Brad Anderson want to tell you with this movie,cause it's not too difficult.You can learn something important about human behavior,and many other important things ,maybe just like your mind working.",7,2,2,21 December 2006
Saw III," Everybody get down !
","Finally great third -part ,as I can see most of us think the same.There's a lot of great twists in the film.In my opinion the acting is fine,I mean I liked all of the actors ,without exception in this film.This time Dr Jigsaw gives new life for a man ,how-?-please see this film after the first,and second part,and you will understand an important message,what will be very useful to you.The concept is not less than earlier,that is why I'm very excited about the 4-th parts quality.This time lot of gory scenes help to feel the hell in this film,but this time the film not just gory,dirty-and perverse-too,and enough realistic to makes you scare ,and fear,maybe to think.",8,1,2,25 September 2007
Die Hard 2," Enjoyable !
","The matter is the too much violence and ,the support cast,and some little things ,these are very relative things ,but I think this film is enjoyable.Emotionally ending,with the strong play of Bruce Willis.I think William Sadler is better than Franco Nero in this film.The direction is just a little bit strange,but this is what gives a special mood for this film.The important is still the same like in first part,one mans war against the group of a terrorist,but this time the place is an airport (Dallas International Airport,Washington)This place is not as claustrophobic as just a normal skyscraper,but in the half way to a big city like New York,I think this could be the concept,what the creators had.",6,0,2,26 January 2007
No Country for Old Men," Not flawless,but good as rental.
","After I had seen this,I had really really mixed feelings.It was calculable,but this did not hurt me really,some-why.I feel like the directors(Cohen's also writers,but from a novel)wanted to make a realistic fantasy film.SPOILER !It was funny to see Javier Bardem's car accident,but the lesson,(message,meaning,or call how you want)of this twist was very,very old as a film history discovery.But it was also executed in some other different ways,in other films.If you agree with me,you had seen lot of similar movies,with similar message.The acting was really brilliant,from all of them,and the directors has a great skill to control,and drive them.As a rental it was more memorable like the Big Lebowsky.But come on everybody,it's also another chance to read the negative comments,cause maybe perfect is not exist,as a famous artist sad.",Null,1,2,18 July 2008
The Lives of Others," No it's for me.
","A well known material,or just based on a material which is (could based on a true events)enough important to make films about it again and again.The director,writer of this film made movie which is enough strong in the right scenes to be memorable for a long time.The structure is mostly good,but there is some boring scenes at the start,and at the middle,but in these scenes the director trying to help us to know what was the situation in that time.And he did this with the dialogs.OK we can forgive this,I think it was not a big mistake.All the characters has something special,what is invisible for first look,but near to the end you will see that values.It's also important,cause the story has some used elements.Seems like the director wanted to make a film,which is not want to be a judge of political systems,but wanted to show what is the different among them.",Null,0,2,23 April 2008
The Mist," (3 out of 10 stars) Despite the smart ending twist,this was a long,and boring effort.
","Few killing scenes poses as something plus,in a film you had seen many times.A few good dialogs,but next day you will not remember to this film.This is a very simple movie,as creators wanted,but what looks good on the top of a skyscraper,that is not sure,that will looks good on the top of the tree.(Ironically,if you can understand this sentence)Rating show it's typically a movie which was loved by most of the audiences,but I'am personally not impressed by this science fiction,horror,with some typical doubt in the government problems.Acting is good as most of the audience says,but the script is not better than a high school student would write it,and the film is far longer than my patience can accept.",Null,1,4,17 August 2010
Resident Evil: Apocalypse," They don't respect you ,and your money.
","This film is a total disaster in quality.First there is another little girl who was a used element more times like you can tolerate in horror genre,and I can not remember one sentence she sad,but maybe she had some.Two: The Scenery:Sometimes video films has better explosions like you will see this time.But zombie filled places are not taking too much attention from me,cause we know what will happen in the next moment,and the whole film is just a boring second part of a medium quality first one.This film is absolute forgettable,cause the scenes are under- acted,and you can not understand,how and why the creators did not realize this film is not able to theaters ,maybe just video,and DVD- stores can tolerate this type of 'ACTION -SCIENCE -FICTION'But personally I wish you wait to cable,cause finally this film is not enough good to rent it.",1,0,1,22 December 2007
Mulholland Drive," Linchs own language is very unsatisfying.
","Mr Linch try to tell us a story in unusual way ( but in a very unusual way,so be careful)The main part of the viewers will not like this main-part looser type of film making,But this is just one problem,with this sometimes careful,sometimes ordinary written story which is not as interesting as Twin Peaks.While you may breath fresh air,the director gives a dust ,and smoke filled atmosphere.The whole film is just confusing,and boring,without the sense of Twin Peaks.The story become ordinary when the director (writer)reconized this is enough confusing,it's time to make a long third chapter.Few people will say this film is perfect cause Linch has a message what is not exist,and that is why this film is original,but they don't know 70s-80s-90s-USA film making.",Null,1,5,5 January 2008
Drag Me to Hell," Rather a science fiction comedy,just can not really love it,while Mister Raimi is not enough helpful to me.
","I had seen this movie ,and this is the only reason why I writing this comment.Spiderman director Sam Raimi directed a parents guide 13-horror,comedy for the main audience.Acting is very good in this film,and this means watchable movie,against I never waited clever story from this,this film has just clever points in the screenplay,but the whole screenplay is just a step here,and a step there,and there are some boring scenes,with oral jokes,and lot of editing,and you just can not follow,and enjoy what happening.I was just confused at the end,but not in a good way,cause Spiderman movies were better in every simple way.Mostly cause the audience felt something about the characters.5/10",Null,0,2,23 November 2009
A Clockwork Orange," This is not too much,but enough to talk about it.
","Stanley Kubrick adapted well a good book,this time.The message is coming across the screen all the way.Malcolm McDowell is really 'what' we want to see on the screen.('what'-I mean he's the object of the story really.This is a very personal story).The story is almost as great as simple and old.The execution has great elements like the music,the mood,the twists,the lightning,the architect.Specially this is a film which was not a good film for first watch.But it was enough to discover this is something,what started to build something,inside my mind.At the moment I have to say,don't miss to read some of the negative reviews of this film,cause there are interesting opinions too.",Null,0,0,13 May 2008
Mr. & Mrs. Smith," Awful.
","So everybody hates when actors (at this movie Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt)can not play their roles,and now I have to tell you ,seemed to me like they don't want to play at all.Cause what you will see is not acting,this is what we called plays their self's ,and we did not wait this from them ,we wanted to see real characters in realistic story ,2-dimension dialogs.There is no intelligent human kind who can believe this can happen in the reality,and you won't too,that is why this film is so bad at all.Doug Liman is just a business man in this project.So don't waist your money, and time cause you won't learn anything about real good marriage ,or life ,it's realistically if you watch a reality show.They don't bored with the screenplay.They don't want to tell you anything.",3,1,2,22 December 2006
The Departed," Very good ,but just for first time.
","How to sell many used twists,and two dimension dialogs with a powerful film.This is Martin Scorseses art and special feature in film-making.I had seen many similar story,and the way of story telling,and plots and situations like this film had,although I had not seen Infernal Affairs.There is lot of time with good acting ,actually Matt Damon ,and Leonardo DiCaproio,but the gang head Jack Nicolsons character is almost just one dimensional.Against this film was far better for first time like I waited,but the ending is too modern,but interesting.Personally I think,or feel like Martin wanted to say something like 'Who cares',or 'This is life','This is natural'.But Oscar for this film ?",5,0,1,5 May 2007

","Against I,am a huge fan of Joel Silver,and against I had seen this film more than 10 times,at the moment I have to say this was one of the lamest action drama I have ever seen.SPOILER:with the happiest ending I had seen on the screen.SPOILER END!Alright this is not the biggest matter with this film,but all the way help for the whole film to become (not the worst-I mean all the way still better than originally made for television films)mediocre.The scenery is poor,sorry the budget was low for a blockbuster.And lot of money was only the price of Bruce Willis.Maybe the acting is the best thing in this film,yes the acting is way better than average,if you want to see good acting,just see this film.McTiernan wanted to make a realistic action film,and in a part he did it,I mean my problem is not with he's concept,but what is the product itself,and what was the original concept,yes you can see the difference.Alright it was hurtfully maybe just for some people.John McTiernan sad once he is a porn film director,yes maybe blood,violence,swearing are the key to be a famous director like Eli Roth,Quentin Tarantino,and lot of others.Alright maybe the viewers won't pay for Romeo and Julie type of films all the time.I liked more the second,and 4-th part as action films ,but not like dramas.The 3-th part was a great comedy.4/10-A famous person sad:Die Hard says if you have luck,and you are mentally challenged,you can survive the end of the world.",Null,1,3,25 January 2009

","I almost cried after The Rock (was directed by Michael Bay )that film had good story ,strong acting ,emotionally end,and there was something behind the story.The only good scenes in this film are the action scenes.But now the main characters Ewan McGregor and Scarlett Johanson just can not play the role,and the dialogs they get are horrible from their mounts (this is the writers mistake).I felt like Shean Bean was not too good for bad guy,but he wanted to be.So the actors had better times, and the most of the critics are says the same.It's a good action movie ,but maybe next day you can't remember anything about the story,and Michael Bay won't be your favorite director again.",3,1,2,9 December 2006
