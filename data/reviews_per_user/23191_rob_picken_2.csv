Iron Man 3," Proof that not everything good comes in three's
","Like every Marvel fan, I was eagerly anticipating Marvel's 'Phase 2' in the movie universe, first of which was the 3rd instalment of Robert Downy Juniors run as Iron Man.However this time around, it's a little bit different, as Jon Favreau steps down as director and in his place steps Shane Black (Lethal Weapon 1-4, Last Action Hero, Kiss Kiss Bang Bang). And if there's anything comic book movies have tough me, not everything good comes in 3's (Superman III, Batman Forever/Batman & Robin, Blade Trinity... the list goes on). Now that's not to say its on the same level as 'Batman & Robin' far from it, however after sitting through a somewhat lengthy movie (it's a lot longer than the last two), it definitely shows why a change of director isn't always a good idea ( anybody remember X-Men 3?? Yeah probably best not to..). While the last two get their fair share of criticism, they were at least consistent plot wise whereas this one sadly, is all over the shop. While this is designed as a follow up to last Summers box office smash 'The Avengers', it really doesn't feel like it at times. Now.... on to the characters. While RDJ and Cheadle do a fantastic job as Iron Man and War Machine, they're barely ever there. Unlike the last two films, the screen time is mostly given to Tony Stark rather than Iron Man, who takes a beating early on in the film by The Mandarin (more on him later). Along the way he befriends a boy who later becomes his 'sidekick' (I use that term loosely but it's true) and he comes back to fight. Only..... The Mandarin isn't quite what we're lead to first believe and we later find out a big spoiler later on.Overall, it's not a bad movie as I've said... but it's definitely not the strongest in the Iron Man movies either. Of course this review is purely opinion, and you're more than welcome to go and watch it yourself, however if you're a comic book fan like myself there's a chance you won't like this movie.5/10",6,1,2,10 May 2013
Live Free or Die Hard," Die Hards still got it!
","Live Free or Die Hard (released as Die Hard 4.0 or Die Hard 4 outside North America and also known as Die Hard 4: Live Free or Die Hard) is the fourth instalment in the Die Hard film series. The film was directed by Len Wiseman and stars Bruce Willis as John McClane, the Hero of the previous 3 films. I have to say being a massive Die Hard fan, for Bruce Willis to be out of the series since 1995 I think he did a great job playing McClane again, overall I really enjoyed this movie as it went right back to the originals format of pure over the top mayhem with plenty of action. The only thing i was surprised about was it being a 15 certificate & being toned down a notch unlike its previous movies, that being said its still a great action packed movie none the less.",9,1,3,10 December 2007
