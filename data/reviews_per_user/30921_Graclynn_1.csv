Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," One of the best films of the year!
","I just saw this movie and laughed the entire time! This film really breaks the norms and exposes many deviant ones that are still inherent in the U.S. Though many will be offended, they can't help but laugh out loud in the process! Cohen plays the character so well, that anyone that watches the movie can sympathize with him at some point and be a little understanding when he commits such brash and offensive acts he's so culturally unaware of. One of the best things about this movie, is when he comes across one of his unknowing victims and we can intently watch their candid yet uncomfortable reactions. It's hilarious to see how squeamish and taken aback they become, yet try not to offend Borat in the process because 'the cultural differences are so vast.' I recommend this movie to anyone who loves satire and a little slap-stick thrown in! I can't wait to see it again! 'It's nice!'",10,3,15,4 November 2006
