Ford v Ferrari," Humanity, Machinery, & Filmmaking Collide Gloriously...A Must See
","How is the destiny of mankind interwoven with the machines we create? Quite powerfully in myriad ways I think we'd all agree. That intersection of man and machine becomes singularly pure in the realm of automobile racing.One of the great true stories is that of Ferrari's snubbing of Henry Ford II's attempt to buy into racing via purchasing Enzo Ferrari's company. Taking the insult personal Henry Ford became a man obsessed with winning LeMans and de-throning Ferrari.Ford winning LeMans, It's a mission no one at the time thought was possible and it rested upon much more than money, engineering, and sheet metal. Two men played pivotal roles not only having an impossible goal to chase, but fighting a corporate culture with zero understanding of how to get out of the way and let them do it.These two men persevered under the corporate interference which often hurt as much as bank-rolled their mission. That two-man juggernaut core was Carol Shelby and Ken Miles. Two very different personalities who often clashed yet had a mutual respect for one another much like brothers of different mothers. While the quest to beat Ferrari and win LeMans provides the back drop for the saga, it is the two men, their relationship, and their success which defines the achievement. Ford v Ferrari as a racing movie is great, but it's these two characters that give it the blood of humanity. Matt Damon as Carol Shelby and Christian Bale as Ken Miles are utterly fantastic in bringing these two to life on screen. Especially Bale as Miles, he literally assumes what you'd imagine the real man was like in a kind of 'beyond acting' if you will. Engrossing.Speaking of engrossing. The cinematography and realism of racing reaches new levels here. In both sight and sound. Framing of shots, colors that jump, and a stealthy soundtrack that provides great atmosphere while never overtaking shows tremendous craft in filmmaking. The film pulls one in as if there was a personal stake involved. That, again, is the human factor. One which surmounts great odds while taking life chances in order to conquer and succeed. I find little fault with this film and think it will be enjoyed by masses who have little or no interest in racing. Quite simply one enjoyable film whose long length is neither tedious or superfluous. I highly recommend seeing Ford v Ferrari. The fact it adheres closely to the true events make it even more remarkable.",9,2,3,17 November 2019
First Man," Mankind's Strength and Fragility Captured On Film Is A Must See
","First Man is a powerful study of the humanity associated with the first astronauts, in particular Neil Armstrong. Ryan Gosling achieves something akin to an actors pinacle digging deep into the role of Neil Armstrong. By choosing to only show the seriousness and sacrifice Gosling gives a powerful restraint that makes the viewer feel Armstrong's dogged determination through his pain and uncertainty born out of tragedy and great sacrifice. Armstrong is the whole American can-do ethic against costly odds and this movie nails that important drive.Most movies we've witnessed about space travel thrive on bombast. How refreshing it is to see the the sheer humanity of those who were willing to give it all presented naked and unadorned. Through the lens of Armstrong's unmatched accomplishment you will tangibly feel both the pride and pain of one of mankind's undisputed finest hours. I can hardly give a higher recommendation. I was a nine year old when this happened. I proudly wore a official Apolo 11 Nasa patch on my jacket at school for the next year. Yet I really had not pondered the human cost so deeply until I saw First Man. You should definitely see it few movies capture man's fragility and strength so stunningly.",9,0,1,14 December 2018
Frost_Nixon," A Portrait Of A Career Lost Provide 3 Landmark Career Turns...Excellent.
","This film is remarkable and it literally provides three career turns...First, late in his acting career Frank Langella gives such a tour de force performance that this is unequivocally his finest work. He simply becomes Richard Nixon in such an uncanny way that words fail to adequately describe it. I liken it to a seasoned immensely successful performer who luckily was chosen to do the work he was obviously made for. If there ever was a more tragic figure in American politics no one would believe it as Mr. Langella nails all the many juxtapositions that Nixon, the mortal man, possessed. Second, Michael Sheen, quite early in his career, reaches a pinnacle in his portrayal of David Frost which for the entirety of his future he will be hard pressed to surpass...He's that convincing. Frost, a kind of international playboy 'quasi-showhost' would seem to be the most unlikely candidate for such a landmark interview series. He possessed just the right enigmatic charisma and polar-opposite personality from Richard Nixon that lured Nixon into doing something no one else, try as they did, could. The gravity of which simply cannot be understated and Sheen's performance gives realism and credibility as to how he was the right man at the right time in history to achieve such. Finally, Ron Howard, whose work has always been eminently bankable yet purely entertainment and somewhat trite in weight, rises to the top of the heap of all-time great directors. He has made his heavyweight masterpiece, a movie which will likely be discussed a hundred years from now. One senses he is moving into a new phase and while he may not eclipse this great statement I have great admiration and hope he may again equal it.I recommend this movie to anyone who even has a passing interest in politics, history, law, or human behavior. The importance of what happened to the American people and President Richard M. Nixon, against the period in American history in which it occurred, is simply impossible to understate. A movie derived on a play based on this seems as though it likely could not undertake such a monumental task and succeed, yet it does so with such clear authority and naked emotional power that I, for one, am awed by it. A must see. Excellent in every way.",Null,2,5,11 December 2008
10 Cloverfield Lane," Mysterious Slow Intensity With A Shockingly Good Ending
","If you're the type who seeks films with a different slant on horror look no further. 10 Cloverfield Lane is a mash-up of different elements of drama, horror, and something else in the end. The film mixes familiar elements to the point of fresh originality.This film has an excellent dark and claustrophobic feel from the very beginning. The writer never gets in hurry and uses the slow pace to build it's mysteriousness. It turns even darker soon though and it gets you hooked. I'd have to say its a well done slow ride that keeps a palpable edge - creepier and better as it goes. Mary Elizabeth Winstead as Michelle is perfect as a conflicted person fleeing a relationship at its end. She immediately has your sympathy as you root for her to get out of whatever it is she's trying to escape. Her escape goes in a much worse way as she awakes from an auto accident. Her new predicament is worse as she is 'saved' by a real 'black belt' level doomsday prepper, Howard. Howard has loads of the requisite creep factor as portrayed by John Goodman. Just like he's not your average Hollywood star he ain't the run of the mill prepper either. An innocent and a monster are now in a really bad situation and there is that element of hopelessly being stuck between life and death played out in an enigmatic and quite original combination.Aside from the tone, the small cast, and the terror it's what is unknown that keeps everything off balance and, as a viewer, on full alert as to what's next. The methodical building up doesn't crash in a letdown either. The ending ramps up and takes a nice left turn. This is simply good movie making in my opinion. A creepy and harrowing ride from start to stop.",8,1,4,26 March 2016
Source Code," Stellar Sci-Fi Tale With Great Humanity
","Sci-Fi movies with absolutely as much humanity written in are somewhat rare. 'Source Code' uses a very 'out-there' sci-fi framework to tell such a tale.A heroic helicopter pilot who died in Afghanistan saving lives in the balance is kept 'brain-alive' so he can be used in an experimental program where he is dropped in to the last conscious 8-minute memory of a passenger in a commuter train targeted by a terrorist. His mission is to reveal the terrorist's name and subsequently allow authorities to stop a subsequent attack that would kill millions with a so-called 'dirty bomb' in metro Chicago. The whole scenario can be repeated an infinite number of times only limited to the time in between the initial attack and the suspected larger one that is to follow. Whew! Jake Gyllenhaal superbly plays the protagonist who is dropped into the train passenger who is experiencing a budding romance with a regular passenger played by Michelle Monaghan. The fact that his last memory is his latest mission in Afghanistan bewilders him and in eight minutes of consciousness on the train he suffers the fate of his fellow passengers when the terrorist's bomb kills all aboard. His next memory is in some sort of 'pod' type capsule where he is being reluctantly debriefed regarding if he was able to identify the terrorist. This all occurs in the first fifteen minutes of 'Source Code', so much for a set-up! As Captain Coulter Stevens attempts to extract what the heck is happening so we, as viewers, are brought up to speed as to what exactly is going on. We learn than 'source code' is an experimental project dealing with the final retrievable memories a person has before, and actually during death. The premise is that these memories can be used to thwart anything that may be follow subsequently. Well, this is a very good sci-fi premise and I have to say this movie doesn't 'drop the ball' as it unfolds.So, where's the humanity? Captain Stevens (Gyllenhaal) has another side that paints a very humanistic palate to hang the story on. He immediately feels a love connection with his beautiful passenger who we learn he has been sharing a common commute for a short time. He also figures out that he has been declared a deceased hero and his unrequited reconciliation with his father. This plays a big role in his decision to keep returning to the eight minutes through multiple 'scenario resets'. In a nutshell; this is where the story adds a great dimension.'Source Code' delivers a fast paced fine sci-fi tale made imminently more engrossing by the 'human factors' of love and light comedy. There really isn't a miss-step along the way even if the ending is, perhaps, a bit of 'feel-good' open ended one. This movie offers the rare combination of an excellent story, perfect fit characters played well, and fantastic cinematographyHighly recommended.",9,0,1,13 June 2011
Deja Vu," Reality Crime Thriller With Neat Sci-Fi Twist
","I usually like sci-fi when it's pure sci-fi. I usually like present day drama when it's believably real. Disaster, at least for me, looms large when sci-fi meets real life drama. So here we have a present day crime thriller crossed with sci-fi time travel...And, this movie kicks butt, works so well, in fact, it's nuances should be studied in film school. It's original enough to be compelling-where we are not in some distant future, but the here and now.The story, the characters, and the effects mesh well to suspend belief to the point that you 'get on-board' and enjoy the ride. This is the way to do sci-fi with believable real life situations. The cinematography, the implementation of technology, and even a beautiful (but presently dead) damsel in distress, combine to give the actors, who are uniformly good to excellent, the boost to put this in rarefied good sci-fi territory. Genre fans are shoo-ins and those who think they don't like sci-fi should enjoy this one too. 7.5 to 8 out of 10.",8,77,105,16 April 2007
It," Go Ahead & Hate, But I Don't Like This One Or The Original
","It defies me this movie is at present an 8.0 (as in the rare territory of a classic like 'Gone With The Wind'). True, I haven't read the book, but this isn't a book review and therefore no matter how excellent the book is it's simply not relevant. What I have seen is the remake of the movie as well as the original. I'm wondering, first why remake this movie as it is pretty lame the first time, at least on-screen (just because the first screen version was lame doesn't mean two lame versions should exist)? Of course we know many paying viewers like it. plus an there's always someone else who wants to re-live something they liked again. Maybe King simply has a Faustian bargain?So,'IT' get's remade. The new version is some better than the original movie even if it is surprisingly hardly different. The fans know who they are of courseand they will eat this up. I don't care one way or the other so I just call it like it appears to me. I don't think it is particularly scary, a good story, or even a compelling improvement over the lame original.I am not a fan of this King movie. I don't like the story or the execution of it not once, but twice. I like Sci-Fi- and the paranormal but I am not particularly on-board with anything regarding IT. I'm left with one thought: the book must have been so good you can have not one but two movies based on it 27 years apart. That speaks well for Stephen King as most writers never get one story made into a movie let alone many stories made into many movies and now, it would seem, the same stories are being made into new movies all over again. Though I don't care for either IT movie I certainly am in deep respect of how King connects with an audience even when his tomes are devoid of palpable scares. This stuff is pure pablum and it quite silly to the point of boredom.",Null,2,7,18 September 2017
Lone Survivor," Humanitarian Decisions In War With Huge Costs
","Based on the ill fated operation code named 'Red Wings' Lone Survivor immediately rates as a classic American war movie. Starting out somewhat by rote by mixing real training footage with segments filmed expressly for the movie it gets the point across that only the creme De la creme of our fine forces make the grade for Special Ops/Seals. The movie quickly gets to business after what seems perfunctory in retrospect. No harm, however, because what these men go through is truly extraordinary and it should be reinforced. The business is of the deadly kind with a multi-pronged battle plan. The four brave men who must be dropped in to do the recon do so with tremendous precision and achieve all initial objectives only to be hampered by poor radio communications and intel that underestimated the manpower surrounding their target. Trained to adapt they move stealthily in order to hide overnight and re-establish communications at the earliest safe opportunity. That opportunity becomes complicated and decisions based on moral high ground quickly play into not a retreat, but survival itself This is the powerful crux of Lone Survivor. How four soldiers fight so bravely, and effectively up to a point, against overwhelming numbers of Taliban is beyond amazing. The most remarkable thing is without doubt how Marcus Luttrell survived. It's a story that deserves to be told time and time again, not only for the one man who survived, but for those who gave their lives in that outcome. It's hard to fault this film in getting this story to the screen. It's both excruciatingly painful and gloriously uplifting to watch. As the credits rolled and the men who actually gave all were shown it is more than clear war is the greatest price so many pay for the freedom we as Americans tend to take for granted. This is a powerful film that deserves to be seen by all who wake up everyday enjoying the spoils. Highly recommended.",9,3,12,5 January 2014
Captain Marvel," Overall: Low Excitement & Entertainment Quotient For A Marvel Film
","I can't speak for the rabid Marvel comic fan and that, I believe, makes for a less subjective take which just as many movie goers have. I like most of the MCU movies or their entertainment value. MCU at its best gives us characters with lovable quirks as well as varying powers which they have to leverage: we like them, root for them, and as we get to know them love them more as cool and unique. Besides the characters things get better when the story is well timed with wicked humor and music.Captain Marvel is weak on most of the ingredients great MCU film adaptations stand on. Brie Larson looks stubborn and cold even though her soft smile promises more. The character just doesn't endear one as such. Samuel Jackson's Fury is a bit flat perhaps because the timeline of the film calls for him to be younger and more an even more cocksure stance. Even watered down Jackson is a big plus here though because it seems the story never seems too dangerous itself. When the Cree are exposed as the enemy they're weak even with CM not yet totally powered up. The whole feels like many half-baked parts even as there's regular and plentiful action. Jude Law is the only character that really hits it square. He's cold, shrewd, calculating, and deliciously two-faced...and that's just his human-like traits.All in all the good/bad story wasn't recycled with any panache or palatable danger. The central character wasn't quirkily endearing as should be mandated - especially as she finds her seemingly limitless powers. And a kind of political agenda seemed to hover which I won't go into. Did Goose the Flerken steal the show?",5,9,20,25 March 2019
This Is the End," Super Bad...
","This is the real 'Superbad' simply because it's super bad. Perhaps Jonas Hill conceptualized something of a Men Behaving Badly crossed with an apocalyptic cleansing of evil with Hollywood at it's epicenter. I'd say there's some kind of truth there! However, as soon as the Franco party was parted everything that was meant to be humorous fell to such a level of immaturity all the jokes were 100% predictable drivel. There's some great comedic zombie/apocalyptic movies and what is here is the polar opposite. As a comedy it makes Animal House look like Citizen Cane. As an apocalyptic flick it makes Armageddon look like Gone With The Wind. Point made, avoid this sorry self-indulgent immature waste of time, money, and egos.",1,6,13,10 October 2013
Green Room," Pulled Me In & Didn't Let Up...Tension Played Out Slowly & Masterfully
","We all know that sometimes one thing begets another thing. Hopefully most of the time the outcome is positive. Green Room explores what if a chance decision lead to a horrendous result and in the aftermath of trying to do the right thing lead to the unthinkable. Something worse than you could even imagine just minutes before.With the premise I've outlined, naturally, there would be many ways to present the problem. Green Room uses youth and a free lifestyle as a great story device. A starving punk band who do not even have enough gas to travel without nicking petrol. In many ways this has the feel of something very real likely experienced more than a few punk bands - most of whom haven't been heard from as they tried and failed. That's not to say they met up with the same fate as the band in Green Room however. This is a bit beyond the everyday and it shows the writers were both grounded in a ugly reality and, thus, inspired.It's a really tight movie after the initial part where the viewer meets the band and becomes aware of how hopeless it is for a fledgling band to make it. It uses unbridled youth and the eternal hope of some kind of serendipitous good fortune pulls off a small miracle, that being the band may pull itself out of poverty and obscurity. Alas, in the case of our story here everything goes about as bad as it possibly can. The fact the viewer hasn't seen another story quite like this helps tremendously. Once Green Room has you in it's tense grip it just keeps up the pressure.It comes down to a chance encounter and a kind of knee-jerk reaction. From that decision the unbelievable begins to crush the viewer masterfully. It's the time from this to the final scene that Green Room shines. I'm not going to say any one actor, or actress, gave a fantastic performance other than to say the casting served the story. However, it's the story and how it was played out that really kept this viewer rapt and totally in an edge of the seat mode. That's effective storytelling, and, in this case, creative filmmaking. Very good, thus recommended. The sad side note is this may be Anton Yelchin's final on-screen role. If so he did an excellent job that telegraphs this young man would have been destined for a much higher profile in the industry.",8,5,12,1 July 2016
The Babadook," At Least It Wasn't More 'Found Footage', Still Misses More Than Connects
","Australians have a way with stark stories and visuals and this is such a film. However the usual magic of the whole rising above the humbleness ain't here. Should I have known by the name? Maybe in some culture somewhere the so-called 'Babadook' commands respect or something, I thought it sounded pretty dumb and in no way hip or cute...or scary. As you can guess I'm a bit at odds with this movie. In some ways I think it could have been a lot better, but it stumbles on it's own dogged determination to build a world of misery for Amelia (I think that's the mother character's name). From the start there isn't a thing that seems pleasant or right, maybe save an elderly lady that babysits the son sometimes. The viewer simply can't invest in the mother or the son and we're not given anything other than the crazy black vapor of the Baba-whatever. The boy is so irritating he's either the most vile child actor of recent memory or he's actually got issues? Either way one quickly feels nothing for the kid, or the mother for that matter. Let 'em lie in their dingy beds in their dark home without any friends save for the 'dookie man'. I can't even remember how it ends I was so divested of the entirety of it. Move along, nothing to see here...how this is getting good reviews alludes me.",4,2,7,16 April 2015
Ted," When You Wish Upon A Star...Turned On Its Ear!
","One has to wonder that it is quite hard to make a truly funny 'conventional' comedy movie, so how on earth can a non-animated movie about a walking-talking teddy bear succeed? This stuff works fairly well for a certain kind of audience when it's animated as director MacFarlane's 'The Family Guy' has shown, but with live performances, and no animation, one would think the pitfalls to be insurmountable. That said, the fact 'Ted' succeeds in an even more mainstream way than MacFarlane's previous productions is a pleasant surprise.The movie is rich in satire and detail (the kind in which you'll catch additional humorous connections with second and third viewings), but has a real beating heart underneath the veneer of its unique combination of raunchy humor and political incorrectness (most will likely be at least somewhat offended at some point) - which is pure MacFarlane! The jokes are continuous and the wit is sharp enough to blot out the occasional dead-spots. Beyond the writing though it would still likely be impossible to achieve such a level of success if it were not for the cast. Simply put, the cast is uniformly excellent â€“ like an ensemble with great chemistry. Plus, outside of the outrageous Ted there's the great device of the Patrick Stewart narration which treats the story as if it is a heart string pulling Disney family movie â€“ until it veers into the profane, but laughable.Ted is even more over-the top than you'd expect in a come-to-life hard partying 30-something slacker teddy bear. Ted is actually a sweetheart underneath the smart-ass exterior. How the directors managed to make Ted look as real as the actors is for lack of a better description, amazing. Playing out the love story sub-plot, Mark Wahlberg and Mila Kunis certainly have that special something commonly called on-screen chemistry. They have to make it work because they are a couple that is simply meant to be and the viewer feels something for them. Add the fantastic characters they're surrounded by and the sum total is movie that manages to combine ribald humor with heartwarming story telling in the most unconventional sense. This movie blazes its own totally unique path. If you like comedies and are not easily offended it is an easy recommendation because it is certainly the best comedy of 2012. Plus, nice seeing Tom Skerrit back...He, he!",8,2,8,14 July 2012
Knives Out," Smart Little Play On Deceit, Greed, & Murder
",This will be my shortest review in simple terms. A quirky whodunnit story in a mansion with an entire family each having their own motives. It gives and takes what the story wants you to think to come around to a sweet ending. Just see it if this kind of stuff appeals as it is done quite well. As for Daniel Craig's performance....it's ridiculously tasty.,8,2,4,15 February 2020
The Irishman," Show Some Respect...Just See It, You'll Be Glad You Did!
","This is a movie you should see. Martin Scorcese has taken a forgotten story and made it vital, even gripping. It is with some surprise that at this late date Scorcese knocks it out of the park with a three and a half hour old mob story. Oh yes he does. It is with no small reason due to the late period acting turns of all three principals: Di Niro, Pacino, and Pesci. Nothing these three have done in recent memory matches their best, but this may eclipse that. The three are perfect and obviously invested completely. Did the real characters play their roles so well?Scorcese is a master. Like Welles and Hitchcock...but he's still with us and if this is any evidence he is at the top of his game. See it and try to deny this is almost certainly the Hoffa saga decoded.",9,10,21,2 December 2019
Superbad," Coming of age film that entertains yet ends up emphasizing importance of choices made.
","I am certainly not a prude, however gross out films for purely comedic effect fall flat in my opinion. When it's a teen comedy it can be more so. That being said this movie rises above the vulgarity of off color language depicting two dependent best friends showing that (in the end) doing the right thing is more important than pursuing what your adolescent fantasies involve.That it gives credence to doing the right thing,IMO, makes it a better film. Not that it's not gross enough to be 'the best movie a 13-yr old has ever seen', but it is filled with memorable characters who mimic real life types and situations as well as the obligatory absurd characters such as the two cops. It's not likely to be a comedic classic on the level of 'Animal House', but it is funny, gross, and..., meh, sweet? How many comedies can you say that about? Kind of like if Me, Myself, and Irene were a teen comedy...but different. Glad to clear that up!",7,1,5,27 August 2007
Creed," What Defines A Winner
","Reinventing an old franchise that has a lot of miles, as well as imitators, seems like a challenge. Kind of like a long shot underdog pulling an upset. Creed is not just a story about a raw underdog boxer surprising the boxing establishment, it's as much a surprise Rocky as a franchise is not dead. Some folks have said it's as good or better than the original. That's high praise, but does Creed live up to it? Overall, yes.Creed's most awkward moments are in the first 20-minutes. The back story feels a little forced and not as compelling as it wants to be. That soon fades and Creed makes barely a misstep in the rebuilding of the most popular on screen boxing saga in modern times. There is lots of conflict outside the ring as well as a brotherhood forged literally in life's hard knocks. Even as it feels predictable it just works. This is a completely engaging and entertaining story. Rocky passes the torch. This is a movie with a rich character who, finally, doesn't have to carry the show singlehandedly - and at this date it totally feels right. Recommended.",8,1,4,20 December 2015
Cloverfield," One Viewing Seemed Not Enough, Twice Was One Too Many...
","Cloverfield seems as if after watching you could, perhaps, appreciate more about it the second time...Well, not so much. It's a bit off-putting to start a review like this, but I think it's apt. WYSIWYG so just go with it.This movie is a bit slow for, say, 15-minutes. After that it takes off and due to the (no longer a gimmick, but a bona-fide cinema school accepted story-telling vehicle)-jerky camera method keeps you straining not to miss anything. If your a fan of sci-fi and, in particular, the monster genre you are going to definitely be 'in'.Now, since you have a commitment it's going to be a fast past rocky ride so you...Just go with it. And it really doesn't disappoint as even things that seem annoying pass quickly due to great tension. Unlike 'Lost' we pretty much know what our protagonists are dealing with, an unexplainable unthinkable creature whose appearance has changed everything in short order. What makes it work is the jerky camera, the quite serviceable acting from the heretofore unknowns, and decent special effects. It is, I feel, hard to make a horrific monster that isn't campy, but the producers have succeeded in doing that with the limited revealing segments showing it and it's offspring(?).If you like sci-fi see it, if you are enamored with 'creature movies' definitely see it...Just, if you're like me, don't expect it to be better or more revealing a second time. With Cloverfield once is enough.",6,0,0,1 October 2009
Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy," Of Three Choices...The Wrong Choice.
","If one wants to delve into the story here you have three choices: 1.)the book, 2.)Watch the '79 serial (DVD), or 3.) the 2011 movie. I picked the later and that choice must be the wrong one. The book is lauded, the British serial revered, but the movie is as flat as a flitter (had to use this cliché' because growing up I heard my mom use it liberally, however, I have no idea what constitutes a 'flitter').Apparently, the director has the skills, a respected cast, good writers, but the condensing of it all to a manageable two hours presented too much of an insurmountable task for it all to properly 'gel'. I've read many mention the slow pace with many visual references and other nods to be excellent, I found it, largely, boring. Granted the cinematography is inspired in its goal of becoming another actor in the story, but the story just drags. Worse, it telegraphs much of itself yet manages to be confusing. I really do not fault the acting so much as the lack of it being allowed to really bring the characters and their story to life.The story comes through enough one believes he should either read the book or seek out the made for TV mini-series. This movie just isn't the best place to start unfortunately.",6,0,2,9 January 2012
Molly's Game," Young Woman's Success & Downfall Is Riveting In Molly's Game
","Molly's Game was a pleasant surprise to me. I went into it knowing nothing of the person or the story. I found it refreshing how the backstory was laid out so clinically so one can see how the entire mess Ms. Bloom found herself in came to be. It's a good setup to how being relentlessly driven can go in several very different directions. The performance by Jessica Chastain as Molly drives the show here as she brings the intelligent highly complicated Molly Bloom to life.You feel Ms. Bloom was shaped into a tough cookie by early failure which drove her to succeed in a quite left-field way. That success did go sideways but, not without a complete reinventing of her life. That life was equal parts greed and proving herself while never selling out even the shadiest characters who often used her - and sold her out. Chastain makes you care for Ms. Bloom even as you never really like her. That's excellent acting because you still invest heavily in her situation It's a humdinger with loads of bad stuff including real life danger and ultimate ruin which looms right up until the finale. The other notable character in this tale turns out to be Ms. Bloom's unlikely defense lawyer Charlie Jeffrey played to conflicted excellence by Idris Elba. This movie makes me want to read the book as I'm sure it delves deeper. That's a real compliment as far as I'm concerned.",7,1,3,18 January 2018
Spider-Man: Homecoming," A Pure Fun Coming of Age Peter Parker Story
",For a suspension of belief plain old fun ride Spiderman: Homecoming hits a sweet spot. It plows a field of it's own by using a coming of age story where Peter is desperately wanting to elevate his game and learning he's rushing in without tempering his burgeoning abilities thus getting in over his head. Call it a superhero's school of hard knocks Add high school puberty and young love in the mix and you have a unique slant that makes Peter as human as he is super. Stark and Peter's assigned watchdog (Happy played by Jon Favreau) ) stay largely in the shadows as it's all Peter which works wonderfully. Special mention goes to the outlaw alien weapons dealer played by Michael Keaton whose smarmy mannerisms make a perfect enemy in that you like his screen time while you hope Peter brings him down. Early on I feared it might be too much of a teen movie but I was wrong as it just built Peter's young man blues to a critical mass. The humor was just right and regular too for a truly enjoyable and fun ride. The perfect antidote for all the dark Sci-Fii out there.,8,1,1,28 September 2017
Fast & Furious 6," I Couldn't Park Realism for Fantasy...Sorry.
","Dispense With Credible Story, Quality ActingAdd More Cow Bell (i.e. cars in this case) Heck yeah, this is F&F6 and we don't need no stinkin' realism to muck-up the fine action. Do we? Apparently not as Vin Diesel and Paul Walker trade leads In a most curvaceous alpine-ish mountain road which is, perhaps, somewhere in Italy near the Alps in order to claim first at the cloistered whatever (a monastery?) where Paul's other half is giving birth to his son. Wow, mindless racing where any minute you could be killed if you went over a curve? But hell yes its worth it if GT-R was ahead of the Detroit combobulation called a Challenger. Definitely worth the risk your infant child will become fatherless, no doubt! I'm rambling, but this movie starts out absolutely inane in every way.I love to be entertained with smart action such as fantastic car chases, but I abhor movie scripts that are so 'dumbed-down' as to make such demands, uh, like erasing a lifetime of education in order to 'buy-in' to all the BS. I also love comic-strip characters done right movie-wise, but supposedly (yeah, lol!) real-life ex-cons co-opted for an elite squad of a Seal Team 6 vehicular assault 'black-ops' teamWell, you need some damn fine writing to pull this off. Sorry, but this is a real mess. The dialog seems as if a fifth-grader wrote , edited, and gave it the 'hell yeah' I like it 'thumbs-up'. It is so poor as to be laughable. I didn't skip the premise, but actually waited until now to say it is among the most inane senseless movie concepts I've ever seen brought to screen with what appears to be a huge budget. P.T. Barnum's axiom of suckers must be like Moore's Lawit just goes on and on.It's not something to be particularly proud of, but the actors/actresses approach this stuff like it has merit. I'll give them some credit for that. With the infantile silly crap they've been given to work with they give it 110%. It can't save this morass of embarrassmentsexcept for the over-the –top car chases. That is the raisin De ete for this whole thing and they've really tried to meld reality with digital 'we'll do anything we damn well please' craftsmanship. This is where the franchise clearly goes from trying to have a foot in reality and stepping deeply into this is a comic-strip come to life movie which gives us total creative control. So, if you can last long enough through the interspersed crap of this mess and get to the several car chases sandwiched insidePlus, get into your no need for reality 'I'm watching an excellent comic-strip brought to life' mode, then you can actually see some art and some value in FF6.What I've asked of you is pretty big bill of goods. Your time is probably much more valuable and why should anyone ask you to dumb yourself downRight? Well, surprisingly I'm going to tell you for the car chase scenes you just might want to tryOtherwise, skip this dreck. I fear for several of these actors/actresses futuresI hope they got a slice of the pie cause we all know there's a huge number of folks who love this fifth-grader with unlimited wallet stuff out there. It'll be a big opening a big following 3 or 4 weeks, a big pay-per-view, and another life on DVD/Blu-Ray. It's still crap though.",5,0,2,20 June 2013
Horrible Bosses," Full of Memorable Quotes: 'That Isn't From A Movie...It is now!'
","Horrible Bosses first and foremost is funny. There certainly is a low- key comedic brilliance in the script, a solid premise creatively at the core from which to hang black humor. Simply put, a shared emotion almost anyone can relate to is an irritating boss wielding an inordinate amount of power seemingly for no other reason other than to be a jerk. The commonality makes it easy to get on board with such a story if done well. Horrible Bosses is done so well that it sells itself in spite of the liberal use of very low-brow humor. When there are copious amounts of foul language and sophomoric humor there simply has to be an element of brilliance to keep things from being weighted down by these elements, thankfully innumerable excellent nuances abound. The performances of the three principle actors and their related bosses mesh perfectly with the script and the result is a movie that is very entertaining in spite of the ridiculous situations depicted. Jason Bateman as Nick Hendricks plays the role he naturally inhabits which is the young exasperated professional who in his deadpan comments and frustrated expressions speaks to everyone. Topping that is the part of his friend played by Jason Sudeikis. Sudeikis gets his Saturday Night Live breakout role here with his depiction of the character Kurt Buckman. Sudeikis is the glue holding the three central characters, as well as the movie, together. His character, Kurt Buckman, is a simple hedonist quite detached from reality, he is wickedly funny delivering his constant smirks and golden nugget comments. And by-the-way, those comments become instant quotes which cult fans will be repeating ad infinitum. Finally, the over-the-top performance given by Charlie Day is so outrageously spot-on hilarious he almost steals the movie. Day's character, Dale Arbus, is the most unlikely of the three to be harassed by a boss and the fact that his harassment is of the sexual variety ,which his other two friends would welcome, is a large part of what makes this story gel. Day uses such an acute and hyper expressive delivery; Horrible Bosses is worth watching twice for his performance alone. Just listening to Charlie Day deliver his lines with his high register high 'rpm' screech slays this viewer. These three actors have a synergy when coupled with this script hit it out of the park for a grand slam homer.There is an excellent supporting cast which in order of magnitude includes Jennifer Aniston, Kevin Spacey, Colin Ferrell, and Donald Sutherland. The surprise here is the perfect performance, against type no less, by Jennifer Aniston. She truly shines and raises the performance of Charlie Day as they play off one another. Kevin Spacey plays a role he's done before except with a cold-hearted hilarious twist making his screen time irreplaceable. Colin Ferrell steps totally outside of his norm once more to create a creature like character that will double the viewer over before he spits out the few corrosive lines he delivers. Donald Sutherland is pretty much an icon who just adds a nice counterpoint to his evil son played by Farrell. Sutherland's role is small, but it is an absolute stroke of genius! And finally, speaking of utterly amazing small rolesBob Newhardt's cameo at the end is the pièce de résistance for a perfect ending! This movie is a slice of comedic gold which in spite of the ample use of low humor rises to a greater sum total effectA perfect comedy which speaks to both the mainstream and cult markets. Don't miss it.",Null,1,2,11 September 2011
Black Mass," Too Much Like A 60-Minutes Story With A Big Budget
","After watching Black Mass one has a detached feeling. A feature length film about a real criminal who had a long reign of running a criminal enterprise should seek to invest the viewer into the events as well as the man, Black Mass seems more like a glimpse that never reels one in to the time, the crime, and, most importantly never exposes much about the central figures. You really do not know more than, say, what a 15-minute 60 Minutes expose would reveal.The frustration begins with the use of Johnny Depp's James 'Whitey' Bulger character. Depp does an excellent job of creating the image of Bulger, but somewhere the writers seem to gloss over what his reign of crime in Boston was actually costing in depravity and murder. It was a truly bizarre reign with a psychopathic Bulger controlling everything the FBI was pinning on the Mafia. How did a government agency with the power to clean up both The Mafia and Bulger get so used? Whatever was going on was somehow made possible by one John Connolly who for unknown reasons, other than what we're told is Southie loyalty, constructed a false story of Bulger being a high-value informant. One can only deduce Connally was, in reality, also a member of The Winter Hill Gang who idolized Bulger and ruined his life to 'impress' the man. Joel Edgerton, like Depp, delivers shades of brilliance as Connolly only to be let down by what the writers glossed over. I simply think as viewers we aren't allowed to know these men in any revelatory way. Jesse Plemons portrayal, with limited screen time, as Bulger's lackey Kevin Weeks is far more revealing. We actually feel who he is a rough street kid without anything other than his devotion to Bulger. The same can be said for W. Earl Brown's dumb murdering thug Martorano and David Harbour's FBI agent John Morris as the we know better what kind of men these were even without lengthy development. It makes the omission of what and who Bulger and Connolly were all the more frustrating.So, if you want to see Depp really bring Bulger to the full light of day you simply won't get that. One feels Depp had the goods, and was in the mindset, to do so, but the writers failed to use him properly. This was just a recreation of an extremely topical overview with A-list talent instead. For those with an avid interest it may still, however, be worth a watch, for others not so much.",6,1,2,13 January 2016
Doctor Strange," CGI Deluged Boring Story
","Marvel's Doctor Strange is a very high profile, and expensive, train wreck. That is if you haven't drank the Cool-Aid and relish everything Marvel. For the acolytes it's likely to be imbibed just as ravenously as all the other Marvel cocktails.Dr. Stephen Strange is a egotistical neurosurgeon who chases his own hype at the expense of a real soul. Oh, he's brilliant in his realm, but he's a victim of his own success and self- centered selfishness. He's not saving lives, he's notching another victory for his personal scorecard. He faces his mortality after a horrific car crash ends his career. Due to his lack of depth beyond his ego he falls into a mean depression. He can't accept his lot to no longer feed his ego as a brilliant surgeon. Hearing of one man who beat the hard science that said he'd never walk again he seeks him out to find how he did it. That leads him to Nepal and, more specifically Kamar-Taj a mystical place where The Ancient One (a strikingly bald Tilda Swinton) trains warriors to defend Earth from a dark force.We get the predictable 'Rocky in training' sequence where Strange learns to harness power from teachings of The Ancient One and her band of mystics. It's all quite boring and rote. In fact it's a deluge of CGI the viewer was already hit hard with in the opening James Bond like big entrance. It was too much there and it only ramps up beginning with Strange's multi- dimensional boot camp where he learns to forget all he's learned. Science is crap and the mind is all that must be re-booted. The fallen warrior who stole secrets from books of The Ancient have become the Darth Vader of the dark other universe. If there's an original idea here please let me know because it's been done with far more flair and the love of humanity it seeks to preserve. This is stuff only a Marvel maven and CGI junkie could find compelling.Sure, Strange survives to win a truce and save Earth, at least until the dark forces regroup and we get a sequel. That is something I, for one, will not be anxiously awaiting. Only for die-hard fans of the Marvel universe.",5,12,25,2 November 2016
We Are Marshall," A Movie About The Human Spirit
","In this post 9-11 world we need to remember the good and moral qualities we possess as humans. Therefore, I believe only someone made of stone would not see the story of Marshall University and Huntington, W.V. as a great true example of the uplifting human spirit we should all let rise to the top in us.That said, how is the movie? Simply put...Sincere and impressive! I think the actors, especially Matthew McConaughey as head coach Jack Lengyel, depict what happened in very real terms so as you feel you're watching those people. I wasn't sure McConaughey had it in him to do such a moving portrayal...Bravo! Matthew Fox also does well, but he is doing 'intense with conflict' which is what he does so well on Lost, thus his acting was not nearly as impressive as McConaugheys.I recommend this movie to everyone regardless of age, race, and gender. What Marshall University did was so important and how the movie represents it is so touching...It's one movie I wish for all of humanity to absorb so that our world might be, like Marshall University, the best we can be.",9,3,3,7 January 2007
Interstellar," Modern Day Masterpiece of a Cautionary Tale
","Christopher Nolan loves the medium of film and the belief there is an, ultimately, benevolent universal transcendence. It would seem he trumpets this in his film Interstellar. That isn't to say he doesn't explore the evil that is inherent in all mankind. In fact, he, more or less, uses it as a 'jumping-off' point. It would seem watching the opening act of Interstellar man has in his hubris and greed, pillaged the earth to the point that it's dying - loosing it's ability to support life as we know it. We're further led to realize it's a fast 'slow-burn' as if we took our current problems roundly classified as 'global warming' and multiplied it by some grand factor whereby we literally feel the loss on a weekly basis. The main character and his family are struggling to hold on to a modicum of normalcy by pressing on in both the cultural and commercial sectors. Matthew McConahey, , is both a father and a farmer with neither jobs being, particularly, easy or straight forward. While McConahey is struggling with the loss of his wife he must preserve his remaining family of two children and his own father. As a father he's still making the grade, but the earth is failing him in his role as a farmer. He has, like the majority, forgone risky crops in favor of almighty corn. In other words, much like today over half of what defines you is linked to cornthis is a not so hidden metaphor to sharecropping slavery. Control as in you can achieve the threshold of existence whereby anything you might experience just over this point you'll perceive as such a delight you'll falsely achieve a pseudo-psychological state of appreciative compliance. It would appear the human race is in dire danger of extinction by their own hand.Lo and behold, there is a 'black' government agency not content with the status quo. NASA lives and in this scenario is actually noble in trying to save humanity ,if not on this planet, by seeding it somewhere so it can begin again if all else fails. McConahey (sp?)is a lapsed NASA pilot and in order to save his family he decides to risk everything in a grand mission hinged on the belief he can make a difference. One man's sacrifice as a kind of saviorsounds familiar.Nolan wisely directly sidesteps the duality of government whereby they're both our society's greatest achievement and, ultimately, our enemy - yes our enemy because eventually humanity's dark side taints our very our ability to govern ourselves and survive - no matter what noble men did before. We're left not really knowing how we came to this wretched point, but we get a prescient warning wrapped up in a damn fine sci-fi movie.. How's this for making a movie for mass consumption with intricate messages, layers as if an onion? The devil is, literally, in the details.Now, I'm really not sure what in the final analysis this movie says. Maybe that makes it great because when I saw 2001: A Space Odyssey I remember leaving with the same feeling. In retrospect I was like 12 when I saw that movie and now it seems to be blatantly clear that 2001 let it be known that man in his grandiosity may be his own demise. But, what is Interstellar? It seems like a letter of hope that man will awake and enlighten his own self to assure he not only exists, but thrives. Men can change the course we have set out on by following our primal instincts as opposed to blindly trusting our status quo. Man's spiritual good can trump earthly darkness - and the universe actually allows for this. Well, that's my take on Nolan's opus of a movie. It's accessible, assuredly so by McConehey's impassioned performance, but brilliantly cloaked inside is the message for a kind of revolution whereby each of us calls on our spiritual goodness to rise out of the mire we've been led into. It's the classic Sci-Fi scenario of good and badonly it isn't some dark army seeking to destroy, it's all within each of us. We all matter, we all have power beyond our day to day existence and we need to connect and act if not now then when? Interstellar's final act is one of hope even if it depicts an hour late indeed. This is one multi- layered movie and it, literally, demands repeated viewings. Low-key brilliance which is actually totally brilliant comes to mind. Highly recommended if not because of the complexity, but you may never see cinematography on any higher plane. And I say this just seeing it in standard 'vanilla' DLP Digital.! Imax analog 70mm should be another revelation altogether.",9,2,7,19 November 2014
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," A Small Town Becomes A Universal Message...Anger Begets Anger...Extraordinary!
","It's no stretch to say Three Billboards will be nominated for multiple Academy Awards. Here in one movie there's easily writing/directing, multiple performances, and cinematography that scream Oscar nominations. But, this is no art house or high film school concept piece. It's a grass roots reflection on how hate begets only more hate and how love, forgiveness, and tolerance is the only saving salvation. Yet as heavy as all of this is depicted it never beats the viewer over the head thus watering down that message. Quite the opposite as turns a soul stirring mirror expertly using darkly held prejudices and black comedy to do so.None of the above could be accomplished first without the superior story telling and directing of Martin McDonagh. He has created a masterpiece of a movie from which the expert casting propels. Previous Oscar nominee Frances McDormand turns in a performance of a lifetime in her portral of an anger-filled Mildred who has lost a teenage daughter to a horrendously brutal rape and murder. She raises the ire of locals and the police force in her small town as she boldly cries for justice. That sets up more hate on the other side which erupts in myriad related as well as unrelated ways. Sam Rockwell as a non-conventional, as well as non-law abiding racist deputy, almost steals McDormand's thunder. These two characters ride an arc of hate that brings them to a place neither could have achieved without the other. Wow! They are musts for awards if the Academy isn't out in left field because they really bring a meaningful story to life. Woody Harrelson is also in top form with a role he plays effortlessly adding to the quality here. If you see one movie in the next year this is one I think can speak to everyone as well as entertain.",9,2,7,27 December 2017
American Sniper," Epitaph of Great American Hero is Eastwood's Best Film
","Few times does a movie remain entertainment yet tell a deep truth, American Sniper manages just that. If one wanted a recent definition of a American Patriot hero it's effectively brought to life by the masterful direction of Clint Eastwood. This movie will be his crowning achievement in a much celebrated career. Such a feat could not be accomplished with just any story however. The life of Chris Kyle, and what he stood for, makes a perfect synergy.Bradley Cooper's amazingly real depiction of a 'complicated, yet simple Texas cowboy' breathes life into a story surrounded by the darkness of war. It single-handedly makes that phrase 'The Greatest Generation' as one that didn't end after WWII. It wouldn't be a stretch to say Coopers got a lock on best actor after seeing the film.American Sniper is rare in that it feels brutality honest yet palatable. While folks such as me led a very normal life stateside men just like Chris Kyle were laying everything on the line for the very belief of good we were enjoying. One can't help but feel humbled by what these men accomplished. War is the worst of humanity without doubt, but within war the best of America often rises above both evil and politics. Chris Kyle was assuredly one of the finest examples in all of American history of such and American Sniper is a fine testament of which we all can be proud. See this movie for any number of reasons, but take away the best we as Americans stand for.",9,196,365,9 January 2015
Southpaw," Learning To Live After Self Destruction
","I think it's kind of universal in that everyone likes a underdog story. Southpaw wastes little precious time in letting us in on the long-shot nature of Billy Hope as he's now at the top. But wait, whatever the story is we're here and Billy has already made it so this isn't really an underdog story at all. But, the life of a orphan who became a world-class boxer isn't going to be wine and roses just because he's now at a pinnacle of his sport. When you're at the top doesn't the old saying go 'there's no place left to go except down'? Old clichés' which have stood the test of time have a core that often is, mostly, a hard truth.A boxer by nature, no matter how good, is often one fight away from his career being over, and not by choice. It's a fickle sport with a potent unknown around every corner waiting for their own long-shot success. As Southpaw begins Billy Hope is at that intersection of what comes next after reaching the top. His wife is urging him to take a break, or quit, before that disaster occurs. The disaster will occur, but it won't exactly be what one might think even as this seems like a movie you've seen before. In everything that proceeds Jake Gyllenhaal is close to perfect in bringing the fictitious life, and heartache, of Billy Hope to the screen. There's a new king of boxing movies, Jake Gyllenhaal is Southpaw in every sense of the phrase. Great movie, highly recommended! Two other fantastic performances,, though paling in comparison, are turned in by Forest Whittaker (Tick Willis) and Miguel Gomez ( 'Magic' Escobar).",9,2,2,18 October 2015
American Hustle," Decent Low-Key Scam/Crime Flick
","Director Russell figures, wisely, that at this late 'Post 9-11' date, nobody really cares if a big-budget scam movie is based on reality or whatever. So, rather 'tongue in cheek' as the movie begins comes a disclaimer that some of the events actually happened telegraphs one shouldn't worry about the real ABSCAM story, but will hopefully chose to be entertained instead.American Hustle does entertain, but at times it does so in such a ploddingly slow build that it tests the viewer's endurance. From the start one doesn't doubt that Christian Bale has once more (emaciated in The Mechanic) suffered for his art: packing on 35 or more pounds and sporting a shaved upper skull in order to don a scrap of a toupee to create one of cinemas most horrid 'comb-overs' of all time. It's quite a sight to see Bale like this. His character is pretty complex and Bale seems to hold back in order to create an interesting dichotomy of sleazy Jersey conman skin with a secret, and highly intelligent, inner thinking man.Like some other famous crime duos when the proper con-woman falls into his orbit the scams get bigger...And, much more profitable. Amy Adams plays Bale's accomplice and mutual love interest. Adam's character is much more polished on the surface than Bale's. However, underneath, they're cut from the same cloth. Adams is constantly displayed as 'eye-candy' with revealing neck and hem lines, but she nails the role so well her looks are just part of her character. As one might expect as the cons get bigger it attracts the attention of an FBI agent named Richie DiMaso played by Bradley Cooper. DiMaso is all about career advancement and he sees an opportunity to get a con-man in his pocket for something much larger. Cooper has grown into a good actor, he gets across the drive of an agent that while ultimately getting some high profile indictments destroys himself in the process. Cooper's DiMaso really is a tragic character here and it really comes across. Fleshing out Bale's character, Irving Rosenfeld, is the fact he has a family which he is largely absent from, but not estranged. He cares for his wife while not actually loving her, and he truly feels that he is a father to her son from a previous marriage. I'm not sure what this tells us about Rosenfeld, perhaps that he has a chivalrous code? His wife is the lovely Jennifer Lawrence who really pulls limited screen time off with aplomb. There's nothing too amazing about the cinematography excepting it captures the era nicely and, largely, just gets out of the way. The direction and writing are a few notches above the median and Bale, Cooper, Adams, and Lawrence push it yet a notch or so more. There is such scant comedy it wouldn't bear mentioning excepting that what it entails is low-key brilliant if compact. I'm talking about agent DiMaso's interaction with his boss played by Louis C.K.. Robert DiNiro makes a clichéd appearance as a mob boss and the most interesting thing I can say about it he spoke in Arabic which added one more dimension to DiNiro's Mafia repertoire.It's likely you could care less about learning what ABSCAM was. But, though this movie may be mostly based on that now iconic FBI sting, this isn't about setting history straight or even exposing it. It's a scam, or hustle, story and as such it ain't bad. Serviceable story and some decent acting bring it up to a 7 rating.",7,1,3,4 January 2014
Oblivion," Another Day In Paradise...Hardly.
","A post-apocalyptic earth that survivors only use for a source of power is the set-up (i.e. whoever these survivors are they do not live on earth). In 2017 earth was attacked by an alien force that collapsed the moon causing utter cataclysmic devastation. But, that attack, even as the earth itself was being destroyed, was thwarted by use of earth's nuclear arsenal. The survivors set up a new colony in space and, while life on earth was abandoned by the survivors they depended on it for the already mentioned power source. Apparently, as is the case in almost every battle ever waged, there remains a pocket of resistance on earth – in an area capable of sustaining life, in spite of surrounding dangers of radiation, rebel resistance thrives. The new regime counts these rebels as a real enough problem to both name and hunt them. They're believed to be alien by the space colonists, an aberration these rebels use to their advantage. They give them a name to match as they're known as scavs.Jack, played by Tom Cruise, is the film's protagonist. He and a partner work for the good of the space colonizing survivors. They live in futuristic (it's 60 years post the 2017 apocalypse at least) 'home in the sky' until which time they have finished their mission and are ultimately rewarded with every survivor's dream: life on Saturn's Titan. Jack and Victoria dutifully work as 'an effective team' as they protect the earthly ocean water power harvesters from the Scavs. It isn't really clear if Jack and Vika (Victoria's nickname) are a romantically linked couple or just co-workers. What is clear is Vika is a 'company woman' all the way and Jack has something wild and independent inside of him. 'The Tower' is the control center which Jack and Vika must answer to. Specifically Jack and Vika keep uber-destructive, very deadly, 'drones' operational. Jack actually goes to earth and repairs fallen drones, in fact Jack loves the earth for reasons slowly revealedhe has a mountain cabin in a still livable area and he has vague remembrances of things that pull him toward earth and not Saturn. Vika, on the other hand, may be human flesh, but is machine like in all other ways. Saturn, for her, is the carrot on the end of the string and she must serve to achieve it.These things set up a film that is first good entertainment. It has amazing CGI which like a painting one can't stop gazing at keeps revealing more. There is much to convey in the juxtaposition between the earth that was, the earth that is, the Scavs who remain the only resistance, and the unseen force that is exemplified by 'The Tower' – as well as the almost painful southern drawl vocalization and scolding face symbolizing said Tower. The atmosphere is really engrossing and, like a cocoon, wraps the viewer inwardly. Think the tremendous emotional loss of humanity's beauty for a futuristic cold perfection. The cinematography here captures this much like the excellent movie Gattaca did over nearly 15 years ago. It makes one long to relive, if only in memories, the best of the human experience - Oblivion is quite effective in actually evoking this mechanism. Cruise fits the character Jack Harper well indeed. Jack may not be the company man his day job seems to indicate as something is very 'un-programmed' in his psyche. He's very human and Cruise excels at this even in a sci-fi setting. And, without spoiling anything here's the crux of that humanity vs. cold science thing: Who really is Jack Harper? Is Jack human, and his own man, or is he a creation of science without free will? If that did not cause conflict add in Morgan Freeman's Scavs group and a strange ship crashing that has a strange tie to an earlier time as well as Jack himself. There's enough cerebral plot twists to make this a serious sci-fi yarn if not on the scale of an epic.Not to be missed is the fact this movie has what may be the best futuristic hardware seen in cinema since, well ever. That would be the 'Bubble Ship' and 'Drones'. These two objects are a tour de force of futuristic, yet grounded in real world physics, designs. Wow! is the first thing which comes to mind, especially seeing The Bubble Ship on screen in full glory. Then, perhaps, a huge cloud of ominous darkness envelopes due to the deadly Drones – definitely scary in light of the coming moral dilemma of using drones domestically (might be a not so thinly veiled warning here). The team who designed these is clearly world class industrial designers and I want something, a car, a building or something, in the real world by this very team. They are literally amazing and that isn't an overstatement. These vehicles work here and carry more than they should (as if co-star roles) in the film due to their presence. Oblivion is highly entertaining science fiction movie making. The story of Jack Harper's world is interesting if not unique or exceptionally deep. The beauty of Oblivion is taking a lot of good things and making them better beginning with a good post-apocalyptic story, adding engaging performances, mind expanding world-class set design, jaw-dropping cinematography, and fully realized top-shelf CGI effects. Those for who this stuff speaks to won't be disappointed as they're absorbing a slice of humanity in their sci-fi.",8,2,4,29 July 2013
Bohemian Rhapsody," Malek's Performance Alone Is Truly Amazing. This Will Propel The Queen Legacy.
","I couldn't help thinking watching Bohemian Rhapsody that movies about bands are generally boring and for the dyed in the wool fans. Bohemian Rhapsody was anything but. The sole reason for than as well as the movie is the singularly unique Freddie Mercury. Watching the film I easily could believe Rami Malek was Freddie Mercury. That's a huge win. However the movie kind of drags the viewer down by keying on Mercury's inner identiy crisis and how it made him a tortured and lonely man. I think there is so much more to cover so we see Mercury as being over the top in everything and not just a amazingly talented sad soul. I have to think he rode the tiger in everyway and he had many heights besides just his chart-topping world success as lead singer of Queen. Sure some of it was off-putting for the average person, but it was who he was and he wasn't just a superstar floundering around off stage.The movie doesn't try to cover all you might want to know about Mercury, but it does give us the Cliff Notes of how he and his bandmates began. The begining, while compact, gets the message across that here was a once in a generation talent, not unlike the earlier Elvis, that was so talented as complete entertainer things happened fast. Against this backdrop of furious success was Mercury's early years of not exactly fitting in at school, a very brittle relationship with his father, and his wobbly orientation with the opposite sex. This was a kind of crucible from which Freddie needed the audience and a kind of unconditional acceptance. It was a very real addiction and we all know addictions have plenty of pitfalls. And, for a moment Freddie did seek a degree of normalcy. Mercury did experience joy becoming engaged to a beautiful woman. Remember though Mercury has some inner turmoil as to how he processes relationships with the opposite sex. Eventually his relationship disolves romantically when he realizes he is at least bi-sexual (probably his own lie to keep from admitting he was outright gay). As all of this is occurring his fame and wealth is ever increasing. Instead of being overjoyed by success, plus freed by his coming to terms with his sexuality, it seems to begin a protracted period of lunacy and knowing loneliness. Calling Queen his family helped to insulate him from the crouching tiger, for a while.That's the setup and then the movie really gets sad. You might think Mercury rarely enjoyed himself while taking ever more risky behaviors. I must believe we purposely don't see how high Freddie rode prior to his decline in health. By most reports he was indulging boundlessly, chasing ever more crazy highs. While we hardly see this we do get it that the resulting aftermath was close to a mental breakdown resulting in a protracted hiatus of Queen as a band. True, Queen never broke up, but they broke down due to Freddie's increasing problems. Malek made Mercury live again, so much so it was scary to watch all the known mannerisms..This movie is quite technically excellent. All of the actors bring the band Queen back to life as we might have seen them at the various times of their career. The singing must be Freddie as it as real as anything you've ever heard. The lip-syncing and band playing is such that you suspend belief as Queen with Mercury once more lives.. The ending has a sort of amazing vindication with real joy. So why is Bohemian Rhapsody more than good, utimately sad, and full of holes as to so much of Freddie Mercury's happy times? Because the bottom line is overwhelmingly sad that such a talent was tormented, lonely, and gone so soon. This may not be the movie everyone wanted, but it's the story we see could logically end as it did. It would be impossible to get such a colorful character wholly so we get what makes sense of the journey of Queen through the amazing character of Freddie Mercury. I believe it achieves what May and Taylor wanted us to see and it will most definitely reach a broad audience who won't be repulsed by things that may well be left to the imagination, but will preserve the greatness that Mercury was so very responsible for. It will, again, revive their musical legacy even propelling yet another generation of fans. As such a movie definitely worth going to see.",8,1,3,8 November 2018
Man of Steel," Epic Reboot
","Zack Snyder does for Superman what Christopher Nolan accomplished with Batman Begins. It's a huge overall and reboot that once more brings a very original slant on what the character is all about.Henry Cavill is absolutely perfect in the role of Kal-El/Clark Kent. He commands the screen just as fully as Christopher Reeve originally did. But, here there's much more going on in both ultimate CGI effects and dark story made palatable. This is a deadly struggle of good vs. evil and it isn't ever far from the surface as action permeates for the most of two-hours plus which makes up this movie.One has to simply enjoy going back to the beginning where Kal's parents sacrificed their lives to ensure his. It hearkens back to both the first comic as well as the first TV episode which fans will remember. It is important and it gets the full impact here with glorious CGI effects. Things move fast from the start and there is only, thankfully, topical treatment of the Kal as a youth through teen years. Don't get me wrong, these have importance, but they're walked through straightforwardly and not dwelled on. There's simply too much action to get to and fans have explored this ad infinitum in the, largely, excellent Smallville TV-series. As already mentioned this is all about the life and death struggle between Zod, protector of Kryton, and Kal-El.This may not qualify as an Epic when thought of in classic terms (i.e. Gone With The Wind / Citizen Kane), but in it's realm it absolutely is without further discussion. It achieves what it aims for, it stays true to it's roots while embracing the futuristic story as imagined with current technology, and for all of that it still embraces humanity which is the central theme beneath everything. This production has spared nothing in lighting, cinematography, and content. Even the supporting cast is stellar. Kudos to the casting because Michael Shannon, Amy Adams, Laurence Fishburne, Russell Crowe, Kevin Costner, and Diane Lane transcend their A-List (which may not include Shannon, but he's A-List here) baggage and insert themselves totally creating a wholly rich support structure.Here's the deal. If you're not already a fan, or lapsed one...Stay away. If, on the other hand, you have longed for Superman once more restored to a level befitting the granddaddy of all comic strip heroes come to life - this is your movie! Highly recommended if you fit the bill.",9,3,8,27 June 2013
Bridge of Spies," Story of Unsung American Hero
","The first crisis of the cold war is hardly remembered as both The Bay of Pigs and Cuban Missile Crisis have eclipsed the debacle of captured U2 pilot Gary Powers and Soviet spy Rudolf Abel. Bridge of Spies, aptly named is Steven Spielberg's moving, and entertaining, big-screen correction of, perhaps, the mostly forgotten story of the first major diplomacy between the superpowers in the avoiding thermo-nuclear war.The story revolves around a somewhat obscure attorney and great American (at least prior to the events depicted) James Donovan. A brittle serendipitous stage of events, uniquely, fell into place as 'the sum of all fears' began to reach a fever-pitch from which an unlikely chain of events thrust insurance attorney Donovan into the spotlight. It was not an enviable spotlight for Donovan as his only purpose was to avert any possibility of Rudolf Abel not being professionally represented in what could be an international incident.It was believed a swift and certain verdict of guilty with the death penalty would be reached justly. The message would be the U.S.A. is fair and just, but unwavering in intent. There was only one thing, Donovan was nobody's lackey.To James Donovan being a red-blooded American meant first and foremost upholding the constitution because it is what separated America from all other nations. Donovan believed any accused human, citizen or not, gets the rights guaranteed by the constitution in a U.S. court of law. While he didn't wholly succeed at first he set a series of events in motion that ended up defining post World War II détente. Spielberg masterly brings this story of a man who steps forward to embody something greater than himself at great cost. Fighting for something larger,he not only defines himself, but who we are as a nation. In the interim, before the righteousness the man stands on is actually embraced he may just be labeled a pariah, there's no doubt Donovan was being the target of many death threats. And without the lack of support from his family and employer. Slowly though his moral wisdom rises to save two men from prison and a nation from greater threat of nuclear war. This is a piece of American history very deserving to be retold, sure for entertainment, but also for our inspection. A real defining moment in history whose good set a precedent. This is, another of Tom Hank's finest moments. He captures the essence of a man whose time to become something more curiously fell into place. This, combined with the impeccable period sets and concisely powerful writing, make Bridge of Spies a very important movie that celebrates a lesser known historical event; an event which still defines how two mortal enemies can achieve a kind of peaceful outcome. I give this movie my highest recommendation and could care less even if there is slight artistic freedom interwoven; it gets the big things right and makes me proud. We need more men like James Donovan...maybe more than ever.",9,3,7,24 October 2015
Split," Bottom Line: Huge Wasted Potential
","Watching Split can be a frustrating experience if you wish too hard for the movie to go like it starts. With the abduction of three teenage girls by a genuinely creepy assailant Split gets off to a sinister start. Right away it becomes a James McAvoy acting class as we learn this isn't anything as one would expect. McAvoy has about two dozen personalities which his therapist believes she's getting both an education and a handle on. This is where some restraint might have kept a different thriller chugging along steadily building a more credible story. Of course this is M. Night Shamalayan so the paranormal has to be injected right along side the attempt at realism. It was brilliant in his Sixth Sense only seeming to weigh down what had so much potential here. It is not, however, a train wreck as it remains watchable slowly revealing the pathos of both the McAvoy character and Casey who is the odd-duck of the three girls. The hard-to-swallow part is how the McAvoy character continues to function being so out of control while manipulating his, we're led to believe, esteemed therapist, plus he's living below the NYC zoo in a secret madman's liar. A wall climbing scene totally jerks what little believably is left by the ending. Yes, with Shamalayan I know I should expect this, even though it comes off rather silly. Frustration is how good it started versus how it failed to use that start's potential fully. Plenty of folks are going to be 'split' on this film.",5,7,21,28 January 2017
Warrior," Fictitious...Yes, But, Damn Moving!
","As movie viewers we've seen about every iteration of fighting/boxing movie that can possibly be made...Not this one. 'Warrior' written and directed by Gavin O'Connor breaks out as completely unique and very moving in the bargain. Two brothers splintered by their alcoholic father are pitted against each other in a mixed martial arts super battle final in a truly moving way. How can one help but feel some kind of empathy for the dysfunctional climax where one may be declared the victor but the larger battle of healing is at stake?This story could be total pulp, but somehow it isn't. Director/writer O.Connor deftly creates a story that works with the excellent performances of Joel Edgerton (the well adjusted survivor) and Tom Hardy (the black sheep good soul) as the separated brothers who only become family after a spectacular showdown. Perhaps incidental, but oh so vital is the fantastic nuanced performance of Nick Nolte as their fatally flawed father. This combination could have been a sub-standard 'movie-of-the-week' celluloid piece of pulp...But, it is anything but! Instead it is one of the better 'fight' movies ever. If you have a shred of humanity see this movie as it will speak to you. You'll watch two hours plus as if it was 15-minutes. Everything works. The performances are uniformly excellent, the writing concise and real, and, finally, the fight sequences brutally real. How can one help but enjoy this ride? Don't miss this as 'Warrior' is truly entertaining and moving.",8,2,7,10 December 2011
Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story," Great in moments...But marred by too immature humor and senseless vulgarity.
","This flick has some great nuances that poke at a fictional musician who is obviously a composite character of all the usual suspects in the post WWII era to present. It nails our absurd pop culture past. It can be wickedly funny doing so. Unfortunately, it also has a tendency to dumb itself way down into the territory of infantile vulgarity. Not to be a prude, but the heavy handed crudeness serves to mar the excellent work of John C. Reilly.Judd Apatow and Jake Kasdan need to go back and watch the Farrelly Brothers catalog. There is an art to mixing tasteless humor, political incorrectness, and making it all acceptable and hilarious. They aren't in that special spot where one overlooks the crudeness-which seems forced not funny. Reaching that 'spot' can be like tap dancing around land mines, remaining funny to the extreme and tasteful enough that crudeness it isn't an issue, I see this as the 'acid test' that separates the brilliant from the hack. While Apatow and Kasdan are certainly way past the hack stage they can still indulge themselves too much and fall glaringly flat on their face. It helps, as displayed here, there are moments of great sly humor mixed in-Yet it doesn't, overall, end up totally redeeming the faux pas committed.I wish I could have absolutely recommended this without reservations. John C. Reilly really is up to the task and turns in a good performance in spite of the writing/directing lapses. I just keep wishing this could have been a Farrelly or a Leiner,Hurwitz, and Schlossberg (Harold-Kumar) project. They would have been able to keep the low-brow humor from being too pervasive.",6,1,5,11 May 2008
Disturbia," A Teen Thriller That Doesn't Condescend
","This isn't a great horror/thriller movie...But, it's actually fairly solid and good enough to hold the viewer. Most teen horror is just too unrealistic and 'campy' (but without actual humor) too appeal to me. This movie entertains and creates enough tension so I'd recommend it as one both teens and adults can enjoy.Though it shares a basic premise with Hitchcock's Rear Window, the main character is confined to his home where he voyeuristic-ally passes time, it does not mimic otherwise. It is not, or is it intended, to be a re-make, loosely or otherwise.The acting is solid all the way around. The storyline, a bit slow, sets up and builds tension that works itself to a climatic ending. However, it's the ending that prevents me from giving this film but a 6. The predictably overdone and quickly carried out ending seems to fall just a little flat for this viewer. Still, a quiet respectable stab at the genre",6,0,3,24 July 2007
Control," Haunting...
","This will be a short, hopefully concise review. I did not know Joy Division's work even though I was in my early twenties when they started to ascend. I always have loved music yet find stuff like The Cure and Depeche Mode not to my liking since it is darkly obtuse-that may explain my being unaware of Joy Division. That said, this movie seems brilliant in the way one becomes immediately drawn under the spell of both Curtis and Joy Division's music. Ian, though seemingly unaware of the audience, keeps the audience rapt. The music, though depressing, is very well played, the lyrics direct and as a result connects. We all had some of the same feelings, and not just as young adults. Unfortunately we have seen the effects too many times. Therefore it is relevant I'd say on some level with us all. As stated the movie brilliantly portrays what happens when mental illness and guilt derails the person. Nothing, short of addiction, is more insidious than mental illness and this is a sad document that should be seen as it pulls no punches and is truly haunting.",8,2,2,1 June 2008
The Conjuring 2," Perfect Tension With Plenty of Action...A New Genre Classic
","There has been no movie to stand with The Exorcist for over 35 years in that movies unique horror set. There is now, finally, one that can. The Conjuring 2 picks up the the same unique dark fear and runs with it. It does run too because almost immediately the viewer is plunged into a revisiting, by Loraine Warren, of the how the events played out in the Amityville N.Y. case. It's a good segue-way not just in tone, but as a personal vision Loraine senses regarding Ed. It pushes her, along with the guffaws of the press, to push Ed into agreeing they'd not take on any new cases. Of course this doesn't last when the Catholic Church asks them to vet a particularly high-profile situation a family is London is experiencing.Now, here's whee I have no touchstone personally if this is played out like the actual case or not. It is probably better this way. Already the viewer is invested in The Warrens as doing what they do very genuinely. Putting them in a case they did actually attempt to vet just seems like the two best people doing what they have a rare talent for. And what a case it is. Without any head spinning we get many of the same chills, maybe played out with a bit less shock, but none the less just as malevolent. It's this keeping it more in your face and simple that seems to be right here. There is a constant fear and oppression which unfolds in an escalating way. When the viewer feels the most fear the whole thing falls apart as it appears to be a hoax. Even the Warrens are shut down. That's when the clincher of a fine ending begins. For the horror genre this is pure gold.While I'm sure those whose dissect these things have made a long list of faux pas the average viewer won't bat an eye regarding. So much has been steadily crafted the brought to a climax by the great ending one feels a sense of relief in which a harrowing journey seems to be, finally, over. I give the entire movie many pluses. From the period spot-on latter 70;s London with gloom and doom portrayed in the excellent cinematography combined with the played straight screenplay and excellent acting this is a horror film that truly works. Like I said earlier, I feel it stands with the gold standard that for so long had few peers.",8,0,2,17 June 2016
Tropic Thunder," There's Sunset Boulevard...And Tropic Thunder
","Sunset Boulevard make have broke ground in that it shows writers and actors/actresses are only as good as what they've done in the last year, but Trophic Thunder makes it all look absolutely knee slapping funny.We can thank Ben Stiller for this madness because who if not him could have got it made? Well, maybe the Farrelly Brothers, but that's not so much the point as the fact that Ben Stiller conceived and acted it with help from his own sympathetic brothers-in-arms - literally! From the fake advertisements and trailers before the film to the last lampoon with Tom Cruise it never lets up in it's look at the superficiality of all things that make up the industry. Check out the 'full retard' monologue by Robert Downey Jr.'s character and the fixation with perks involving the ubiquitous Tivo which the agent played by Matthew McCounahey is determined to secure. They're inspired and hilarious to the extreme. Speaking of Robert Downey Jr., he's simply able to pull off the 'Tootsie' of the last 20 years as he plays his over the top roll here. This guy can act in any role as evidenced by this role being added to an already impressive cannon.If you love comedy, especially that which easily dispenses with a bit of reality to actually lampoon reality SEE THIS MOVIE. It's perfect to watch in mixed company and the more the better. It's a real crowd pleaser.",7,1,4,16 September 2008

Seriously this is the ultimate escapist celluloid brilliance I've witnessed in over 50-years of movies. This film is the masterpiece of the genre. What a cast too. I think after some settling I will actually feel inspired to go through the entire franchise again knowing this carrot is at the end. No criticism of any kind can I think of. Truly excellent to the point even if you're never seen anything Marvel you should step up and see Avenger's' Endgame.,9,3,7,28 April 2019
District 9," A Stunningly Fresh Take On Aliens Inhabiting Earth!
","First, it needs to be said that this is a science fiction movie that is uniformly excellent. Neil Blomkamp deserves much praise for originality in writing and directing. Beyond that, Sharlto Copley's acting stole the show, depicting character Wilkus Van De Merwe like a Steve Carell (The Office's Michael Scott) geek-ed up on Starbuck's and more!If the story isn't exactly new, aliens coming to earth and living among humans, every other detail screams inventiveness...From the beginning where the amazing gross, but intricate creatures are saved from dying inside their ship to the ending where the government's 'Fortune 500 Army' stages a no holds barred attempt to kill Wilkus Van De Merwe, you never feel less than rapt by the telling of the conflict you know is bound to happen. Though never overtly a political movie, there's a lot of social commentary that provides an undercurrent regarding greed and war.This alien movie, when held to a broad assortment of standards, simply shines. As already noted there is a really good storyline-the one must from which everything else springs from. The style of the movie, a shifting between a documentary like film record of the events to the normal third person aspect of 'looking-in' that we are more comfortable with, seems, to me, as a perfect way to pull the viewer in fast. The special effects, in particular the amazing detailed aliens who we have never seen the likes of, are a tour-de-force...they are strangely gross and compelling-never being reduced to any kind of campiness. Amazingly well conceived and realized! The real 'ace-in-the-hole' is the portrayal of Wilkus Van De Merwe by Sharlto Copley. At first you think of him an annoying nerdy geek and in short order you become very invested in both his character and his plight. Copley's deft acting works in a way not unlike Don Knott's portrayal of Barney Fife as it almost steals the show from everyone and everything else, his role makes the whole story cohere because you are feel empathy for his character and root for his ultimate survival. He may still be a geek underneath it all, but his transformation from milk-toast Mr. Rogers type nerd to a justice seeking 'Arnold-like Terminator' is the movies single most brilliant vehicle.District 9, to me, is an instant classic science fiction alien tale. It starts by grabbing your attention and wastes not a frame in building its story slowly gathering speed and urgency. Most science fiction, as well as a large number of other genre, movies blow it with a wham-bam quick 'tie-it-up' maximum shock ending that tastes bad and leaves the viewer cold. Not this one...District 9 ends in a worthy fashion that satisfies and still leaves the door open for almost anything in a sequel. This could be the start of another great science fiction franchise. I recommend it to sci-fi fans without any reservations and give it a 8.5! Excellent!",9,2,5,5 September 2009
The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford," Best Western Since Unforgiven
","One of the finest western movies this viewer has ever seen. There is so much atmosphere here it's hard to take it all in. Truly amazing cinematography with every device imaginable. As for the story it's quite interesting because it doesn't try to be too broad, it's narrowly about how Robert Ford's emotional state was such that his idolization of Jesse James turned into an all consuming paranoia...Ultimately leading to the 'cowardice' way he assassinated who was at the time Missouri's most wanted outlaw.The eccentricity and malevolent ways of Jesse James are portrayed stunningly well by Brad Pitt. Its the framework the entire movie hangs on as there is simply no story without this infamous western icon being portrayed realistically...Exuding dark menace and creating palpable fear among friend and foe alike. James may be a folk hero to some, but Pitt shows him as a heartless and unconscionable empty soul. Devoid of a moral compass, James can shoot a 'friend' in the back without remorse or pistol whip a young child experiencing no regrets. In spite of this unrepentant personality James was very charismatic...This is a juxtaposition certainly driven home by Pitt's screen presence-simply put, he is the 'Outlaw Jesse James'.This dark backdrop brings us to Casey Affleck's Robert Ford. With James you want him to get caught, but you like him regardless. But, with Ford I was as conflicted as was his character so miraculously inhabited by Affleck. Is Ford as evil as James? Is he sane or insane? Though not loyal is he doing his fellow citizens some kind of justice that he should be commended for? The answers, all of them, are being pondered in every frame here. What may appear to be a slow paced movie is so packed with morality plays it's nothing short of amazing. True excellence in directing and writing make this a wringing experience to watch. But watch you will and somehow two and a half hours pass with little or no regard.Do not miss this movie. Brad Pitt has already shown he can inhabit a character completely, here he raises his personal bar to the highest yet. Casey Affleck will, after this, be A-listed simply because he is able to stand toe to toe with Pitt's great performance, maybe even playing a more difficult character in the bargain and doing so with aplomb. Westerns don't come better...And to beat all it's based on historical truth!",9,2,5,24 January 2008
JFK," One Man's Search For Truth Against Overwhelming Power
","It's late 2012 and with that there is a certain kind of luxury one has when reviewing a film that when released seemed largely sensational, perhaps even an extreme weaving of more fiction than fact.As the years passed from 1963 to this depiction of Clay Shaw's trial (in 1969) it still was an accepted fact that Lee Harvey Oswald was the lone assailant of President John F. Kennedy, thus the hard-to-swallow claim the accused was part of a larger conspiracy birthed in the blackest operations of the U.S. government by certain benefactors. However, by the late eighties their was a definite turn of the tide with a large number of Americans finding the 'lone assassin' with the 'magic bullet' theory patently ludicrous. Enter Oliver Stone, a man impassioned by another man's lone crusade for the truth regarding one of America's darkest hours (The Civil War being the darkest and this being next along with 911). This picture was a tremendous gamble which shows the director's own brand of courageous patriotism.The above said, this is a film first about Jim Garrison, the fearless D.A. of New Orleans Louisiana. Garrison was to possessed to the point of obsession which cost him dearly personally. He ended up almost wrecking his family life for years and even depleting his own personal savings in his single-minded pursuit for justice to be served in what he believed was the highest act of treason: the conspiracy to kill J.F.K.. Stone goes about giving us Jim Garrison in a very realistic, if sympathetic way. One can not fault this because now, over 40-years removed from Garrison's prosecution of Clay Shaw, the mountain of known evidence is more vindicating related to Garrison than ever. It will likely continue to be more so even as those directly involved are largely deceased.The story of Jim Garrison is fascinating. Garrison had the back-bone to do what no one else either would or could. Kevin Costner gives a superlative performance all-around in his depiction of an lowly local elected official attempting to take on the world's greatest concentration of power. It is only due to his extremely high-profile that he likely survived and the danger of his possible assassination builds throughout the film as M.L.K. and R.F.K. are also murdered. Stone has reverence for the quest and takes it seriously. Though the movie is long, and some would say slow, I find it fastidious in detail and never boring. In other words it is truly moving that a man 'without a dog in the hunt' would hang himself so far over the line in his quest for the unthinkable. The viewer both roots for Garrison and cringes at how he is kept from securing valuable documents as well as many witnesses (like the obviously knowledgeable 'Mr. X'). One must feel pain for Garrison as even the trial's supposedly neutral judge is openly hostile (what a waste of humanity whoever this low-life of an empowered official was in real life).This movie is exactly what President Eisenhower warned Americans of so take it that way and do a comprehensive research of your own. You will end up validating so much of what the movie presents that you will be much more open to the larger picture of what both Garrison and Stone extrapolated. No, it may not be 100 accurate, but if it isn't the errors are forgivable with obstruction at the highest level preventing a clearer picture. That is the power of this movie because it literally forces the viewer to think and pushes one toward more investigation (it actually did force the government to release a quantity of previously sequestered, yet still highly vetted, information as well as calling out the Warren Commission Report as fiction). It is a wake-up call because we still are largely victims of government by the few in this post 911 world.I applaud Oliver Stone for bringing Jim Garrison's story so effectively to the masses. I am glad that not only was it surprisingly successful upon release, but that it has continued to be seen by millions more each year some twenty plus years later. Two things should be mandatory for all U.S. citizens: read The Constitution and see this movie, 'nuff said!",9,2,10,29 November 2012
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Cinema Candy With Some Alt History Revision Per Tarantino
","OUTIH is pretty much a big love letter to early seventies Hollywood. It helps to have a total A-List cast no doubt. But it's the care in the recreation of a time and place that grabs the viewer. The story, until the Tarantino signature ending, is nothing too special other than it is quite a good palate for DiCaprio and Pitt to give us some memorable characters in a time of change in both politics and the entertainment business. What is special is the way it uses the Charles Manson gang. It's pure Quinton Tarantino alt history wrapping up things as he, and the audience, would have preferred. After the quite entertaining slow build-up it's a great pay-off elevating the movie several notches. It probably won't get the cult status of Pulp Fiction but it has lots of great period props and music, fine seventies Hollywood ambience shot with meticulous cinematography, and that quirky Tarantino pat dialogue. It's a mass audience appeal movie as such that retains a lot of the Tarantino DNA. I think it's a great ride.",8,3,7,15 September 2019
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Uncommonly Entertaining Alternate History
","I can't say how folks born in the 80's and beyond will feel about this flick. It is such a nostalgic look at the late sixties culture grafted on to an outrageous real murder turned on its head here in a creative alternative way.What works without question is the attention to period kitsch, music, and a wicked lampooning of the rise of the unabashed self-important Hollywood art community of actors and directors breaking up the old studio stranglehold. There will be blood, a whole lot of it if 'Charlie's Angels' (& one particular Devil) extract a psychopathic warped justice.So it ain't really even comparable to Pulp Fiction. It takes a kind of old story of star whose career is flagging and then goes on more than a single interesting turn, several in fact.As expected dialog is sharp, but it is more visual and...funny as a result. This is a homage to a time and an industry as well as poking lots of fun at the whole ridiculous nature of these self-indulgent folks with their heads up their @$$e$. In the end it's not about if the story has anything original and moving...It's fun and it's the ending we wish would have happened if we could write it around the characters we get here.",8,1,2,12 September 2019
Gone Girl," Not Hitchcock
","This is a riddle wrapped in an enigma and I'm not just talking about Amy Dunne. The movie is basically the undoing of Nick Dunne, a cheating husband. It slowly becomes apparent, in spite of himself, the problem is he married the wrong woman to leave. The story that ensues is in parts both plausible and implausible where both are treated as one and the same. At many moments the story reels itself in with the believable, cloaking it's absurdity almost expertly. Almost is the key word here, much requires more than a modicum of suspension of belief.Using a failing marriage as the cauldron of resentment inside Amy Dunne is certainly believable. The extreme manipulation she goes about creating her own disappearance/re-appearance is at turns brilliant before veering into the insulting. Amy becomes a murderer, or was she always so mentally unstable, under the radar, she was destined to no less? As things unfold who she really is builds.Gone Girl insults the police and media, two groups that in their whole deserve to be held under the microscope. Both come off so self-serving inept, even criminal, the writers veer into comedy to shroud the ample silliness. While the media today has gone tabloid sensationalist driven and deserve the ridicule one still hopes there is no earthly way that law-enforcement can be this stupefyingly dumb and corrupt. Yet, even that is wrapped into that shard of fact that many innocent people get railroaded.So, Gone Girl may not be all that it aspires to. Viewers certainly must 'dumb down' what is accepted as possibly believable, it does keep the viewer watching because what may come next is never really given up too early. The craziness of the story, thus, moves slow and is rolled in things that could be which helps. As far as bringing this somewhat 'hard-to-swallow' ride to the quite alright open-ending requires talent and finesse. The cinematography is fine for such a story never being too defined or bright, totally right for a modern mystery. However, in the end it's the acting. Ben Affleck nails the often befuddled Nick Dunne who lost so many pieces of himself in his marital ride he struggles to regain his life. Rosamund Pike plays the America's Sweetheart writer character Amy Dunne to perfection going from precious to psychopathic maniacal manipulator, and murderess, morphing from an intelligent beauty to Satan himself. Tyler Perry hits the right notes on what could be any present day high-powered legal defender. Neal Patrick Harris plays the guy that lost the girl only to over-achieve financially - still never getting over his lost love which, almost comedic-ally and ignorantly leads to his murder. And, finally, Nick's sister Margo, played by Kim Dickens is the sibling we'd all love to have in times good and bad. The cast gets a big 'thumbs-up' for keeping the non-sense so much more compelling than it has any right to. Thus, in the end, I think there is good acting that acts as a catalyst in raising the viewer's interest and entertainment value. If this could be accomplished without the mis-steps of low credibility as far as the story goes Gone Girl would get a 8 or so, in the end it is less though still enjoyable. Almost, but not quite, Hitchcok worthy.",6,3,12,13 October 2014
Drive," A Thinking Person's Heist Movie
","The movie 'Drive' is a sort of anti-action heist thriller. There's a heist, there's action, and there's graphic violence, but it is all background atmosphere. Speaking of atmosphere, the movie certainly thrives on it, from the beginning and sustains it, never rushing or telegraphing the next event. It all hangs on a good character driven story where the viewer becomes invested in the protagonist even while feeling a voyeuristic wall due to the central characters utter lack of emotion . You bet the only real feeling he possesses must be a bizarre chivalrous code. You do not anyone like this, but you feel empathy. The strangely out of place, 80's synth driven soundtrack is eerily off-putting helping to create a general unease. The cinematography is artful, it's brightly lit yet claustrophobic and dour, strangely devoid of the California warmth which appears regularly as a counterpoint. The whole it creates keeps the viewer nervous, off-balance with a sense of dread. There is a quite storm brewing which is constructed in a truly excellent way, the director understands and accomplishes an imposing journey as the slow reckoning develops.Ryan Gosling makes this movie. His cool remove serves the excellent script perfectly, you get the feeling you are not watching a A-list actor playing a roleYou are watching a real person in a hellish situation doing whatever it takes to get out. Supporting him is a very able cast which includes Albert Brooks in a very different light and he's quite good with limited screen time. Ron Perleman is a sickly menacing gangster who never liked being allowed to work at the 'mobs' digression and steps out on his own, no longer taking leftover crumbs while the real money flows upward. Cathy Mulligan plays a romantic interest to Ryan Gosling, she turns in a key character performance requiring great finesse and nuance as there is limited dialog involved, that is likely more difficult than delivering linesimpressive. Brian Cranston from Breaking Bad fame plays an aged luckless loser who has believes his last chance at redemption for his own misses ride on the other worldly driving skills of Ryan Gosling's 'Driver' character; it works because you fear he is going to finally sink and take his protégé with him. Christina Hendricks from Mad Men has a serviceable cameo. All in all, an excellent cast given a decent story which is directed deftly by rising director (definitely rising faster since Driver') Nicolas Winding Refn, this movie gets a strong recommendation.",Null,2,5,29 September 2011
The Number 23," Obsessive Compulsive Psycho Murderer...With Shock Therapy Induced Amnesia Too!
","In all the movies I've seen Jim Carey in I was never able to forget he was,well...Jim Carey. With this movie the inner actor breaks free of the man himself to become the character and not the actor playing the character. In other words, no rubber faced overacting here, just an excellent portrayal of a one-time institutionalized mental patient who was 'cured' and years later is, seemingly, once again heading for a break due to a book he receives as a present from his wifeStrangely the book is exactly about his life...and how the number 23 is darkly connected to it. But there is one difference, his character in the book is a murderer and since he is a family man that can't be him...As far as he knows? This movie is fairly polarizing and is likely to be one the viewer either strongly likes or dislikes. You have to be committed as it isn't easy entertainment or fast paced. Instead it's atmospheric tension and moodiness slowly builds and pulls you in deeper if you can stay with it. It gets very creepy and only in it's ending does it let up. In fact it is, in MHO, an excellent psychological thriller until the ending, which is light and almost happy. Hey, that in and of itself is an unexpected twist, yet it's the only weakness in an otherwise solid movie. Recommended.",7,1,2,22 July 2007
Gran Torino," One Man's Unexpected Path To Redemption.
","Clint Eastwood has certainly turned out to the best 'double-threat' actor/director in Hollywood. As he has so often, here he once again portrays a very conflicted man. To complicate things as the story begins we see him at the funeral for his wife. The movie wastes no time in our realization that Walt Kowalski has been an volatile island his entire adult life who likely was reined in by the balance his better half just barely was able to provide. Without her it seems he just may veer into the abyss as everything around him seems to be in some state of decay.Walt has stubbornly chosen to remain in a way past its prime area of Detroit now inhabited by more Asians than Americans. He has a problem with Asians quite naturally acquired in America's forgotten war, The Korean War. That horrendous war has scarred him and he just is not the kind of guy to reach out. It's his racism that ultimately leads him to finally extend himself to his neighbors as well as his priest. He realizes, you will sense, that even a man's man cannot find peace through violence. His solution is very unlike the other famous characters he has etched into our celluloid consciousness as he chooses a very different way to end the vicious circle of hate.First, and foremost, this movie entertains. It does so with a sly undercurrent of humor mostly from the crusty Walt. The other characters are rich and well portrayed also. Key to the story is the developing father/son relationship Walt grudgingly initiates with his teenage next door neighbor Thao. I will not spoil that as its pure golden. Walt Kolwalski is a real curmudgeon that, while vile, is so funny you gotta love him. Though we never meet his wife we know she was the absolute love of his life. He's old too and perhaps is facing an eminent decline, possibly soon as we are led to believe. Against this backdrop he faces head-on his mortality and his wishes to have done things differently...Not the least of which are his regret of not being a good father to his sons and, even more importantly, not seeking God's forgiveness. When he decides the situation he and his Asian neighbors are caught in must end he seeks a resolution within which he constructs his own brand of redemption.Once again Clint Eastwood has brought to life a variation of the character he plays so well. This movie is full of humanity - much like Million Dollar Baby. Thanks Clint for this great movie. If you see it you will be richer for it.",10,8,19,15 December 2008
X-Men: Apocalypse," Polarizing: For The Faithful Fan Who Will Likely Love It
","This is for real fans, those longstanding readers of this type stuff, but probably for CGI junkies and, more generally, for those who lap up things getting blown up real good. For others simply seeking entertainment, noting to see here, move alongIt isn't entertaining in spite of stuff thrown in for the general moviegoer like the mid-part school rescue comic relief dialog et.al. It seems it's hard to root for the good mutants, the X-Men, most of the flick because of the all-encompassing darkness. As in: either I hope this gets better or ,maybe, I should have gone to Deadpool a second time. It's place is with the dedicated fan and to advance the celluloid story, it does both at the loss of the casual viewer who feels rather gut- wrenched and pummeled upon exiting.",5,2,9,25 May 2016
Ex Machina," Garland Fully Arrives. Recommended.
","Watching Ex Machina you'll witness a talent coming into his own. That would be Alex Garland who wrote and directed this movie which feels, at times, on a plane with 2001: A Space Odyssey. The viewer glimpses into a future in which so much will go wrong at the hand of man. It's often an uncomfortable watch, yet totally mesmerizing due to Garland's masterful vision and compact writing.This movie may, at first, not seem nearly as amazing as it is. The idea of the AI genie out of the bottle isn't, of course, remotely original. Forget that, however, because the AI as realized in Ex Machina is. What could be cold and analytical is compelling with little sensationalism save for some well envisioned futuristic technology.Ex Machina never bores, nor does it seem to speed along. The blackness just creeps in and builds. The locale and sets impress. The cinematography captures the feel of a Moreau's Island type world within a world, complete with the out-of-touch brilliant mad scientist. The protagonist, Caleb, is both lab rat and a litmus test of morality and conscience. It's a great conflict keeping the viewer off-balance in a good way.Garland, like the visionary director/writer Orson Welles, along with an amazing performance by Alicia Vikander as bot Ava, has constructed an disturbing view of the hubris of man. Domhnall Gleeson plays the central figure, Caleb, in his likable geek persona. Worth special mention is Oscar Isaac as the bent billionaire scientist Nathan, he's the right balance of unconscionable menace and futuristic visionary. Perhaps not for the masses like the Kubrick's epic '2001', it many times feels more prescient.",8,1,4,23 June 2015
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," One Mans Affliction As A Metaphor For Love And Loss
","First, I am struck by the originality of this story. I mean it's frickin' brilliant. But, the real brilliance is in the detail of telling a preposterous story that serves as a perfect metaphor for life's journey of love and loss.There must have been tremendous hurdles to telling this in a way that was not sensational - to make it seem relevant and not fictional. Yet, the digital effects are so natural and the seamless transitions so well done they merely serve the story and never get in the way. Brad Pitt is shear perfection, Cate Blanchett is absolutely transcendent and elegant, and Tilda Swenson is so wonderfully loving that the viewer can't help but be drawn into the shear humanity of it all. Direction and cinematography are certainly up to the same high level. I would vote for this in just about every category for the year's best.Bottomline: In a year where there are some very strong contenders for best picture I feel this is the one that rises to the top. If you miss it you will deny yourself something very special. A must see.",10,1,2,30 December 2008
Pawn Sacrifice," A Great Cold War Victory & Rembrance of A Iconic Person
","Bobby Fischer was, by many knowledgeable chess aficionados, the greatest chess player to ever live. As of 2015 there is a sizable number of twenty-somethings (maybe those in their 30's) who have no clue who he was, maybe even never playing the game of chess either. One might see this as an opportunity to correct a slight injustice or a sign that no one cares? Tobey McGuire goes for a bit of later day historical correction in Pawn Sacrifice as he and writer Steven Knight bring Fischer back to life for your introspection and entertainment.Chess as entertainment? In spite of all it's drollness, yes. This is in no small part due to the enigmatic Fischer and his all-time great defeat of Boris Spasky in the Cold War super-match of 1972. It sealed Fischer as chess icon and political pawn in a time when the US was trying to assert any dominance over communism it could achieve without actual war. Within this the game of chess was elevated to a heady pinnacle from which it quickly fell and has never quite recovered. Perhaps if this was all it would be more of piece for a documentary, but with Bobby Fischer being the most integral ingredient it deserves more and that is what viewers get here.Without ever bogging down in too much minutiae the story of how a very young boy with laser like vision believed he was to be the world's youngest Grandmaster Chess Champion is quite entertaining. Fischer from the time he was self-aware believed his lot in life was to be the world's greatest chess player. Complicating it all was the fact that he was somewhat anti-social outside of chess and had a mother who the CIA pegged as a potential communist political threat. High strangeness ensued in Fischer's youth that would only ramp up with age and his own disillusionment. In spite of it all he became a icon in the Cold War between the USSR and USA. A reluctant American hero if you will even though he crashed and burned as he fettered away his chance at becoming the youngest ever World Grandmaster Champion.McGuire brings it in his recreation of Fischer. The viewer actually feels turmoil just watching McGuire bring to life the war between his own greatness and crippling paranoia. It's not a totally sympathetic characterization in that as a viewer you often feel contempt for Fischer's selfishness. I'd say there's great truth in McGuire's realization of the man who for a moment united American pride much like the celebrated moon landing of 1969. It's also nice to see a fine role, and performance, by Peter Saarsgaard. And with limited screen time Liev Schieber turns in an excellent portrayal of the great Soviet Chessmaster Boris Spasky. Add an excellent score by James Newton Howard which includes fantastic period music and what could be a boring as paint drying is anything but. This is a great movie which also sheds light on the injustice of Fischer being somewhat forgotten as of the new millennial. A highly recommended film that should spur some latter day interest in a time where we counted winning against Russia in any way possible, even at the game of chess, as a great victory for our nation.",7,1,3,15 February 2016
Hidden Figures," The Space Race Begins To Become Race-Less
","Hidden Figures is one story that needed to be told. One thing is that we as Americans never tire of a good movie about how we became the world's preeminent space explorers, but the human story is what makes it truly compelling. Within that element there's many stories of which this amazing one is a crucial part most folks weren't aware of. It's how a group of talented female colored mathematicians contributed so much. Of that group were three whose contributions were of mission critical importance. This is their story.Hidden Figures elegantly, and compactly, tells how Katherine Johnson, Dorothy Vaughn, and Mary Jackson, three young black women, became iconic technical experts in NASA. The world in the early sixties was anything but colorblind but these three women's talents made NASA begin and continue to change. They truly made the space race race-less. It's something almost as remarkable as what they contributed to getting us to the moon. It must have been about as trailblazing and unfriendly. But like NASA itself they persevered. Hidden Figures respectfully tells the true story highlights in just two hours.As a viewer and an American I find this movie uplifting and very positive. Director Theodore Melfi doesn't waste a scene. There's no dead air or boring side stories here as the movie moves at a brisk pace that just gets better. The blending of period and current cinematography is excellent. Without nitpicking details the sixties is well recreated. Taraji P. Henson, Octavia Spencer, and Janelle Monae are uniformly excellent as Johnson, Vaughn, and Jackson. Ms. Henson is especially compelling in her performance as Katherine Johnson. I've enjoyed Ms. Henson in everything I've seen her in and she truly shines here and does an iconic woman's story justice. Supporting her are Kevin Costner as her boss and Jim Parsons as her reluctant supervisor. They bring the right tension and stay out of eclipsing the story otherwise. This is perfect casting aiding to bring a story to life with the impact it deserves. Overall Hidden Figures is an excellent movie telling an important, largely unknown, story as it so richly deserves. This is a reminder of why a colorblind society is so vitally important. Within true equality, acceptance, and cooperation getting to the moon and all things beyond become reality. Highly recommended.",8,3,9,5 February 2017
Sing Street," A Fun Film With A Heart...And, Some Good Music
","Being 57 years of age I'm hardly the target market of this film. But hey, since when does art have to be polarizing? It just needs to be good and have something one can connect to. Sing Street connects with the human spirit inhabiting us all.Sing Street is about being young and dreaming out beyond what you know. That's pretty universal. Conor has a need to break out of his existence, not reckless rebellion, just to follow his muse which he decides will be music. Turns out he has some talent and is surrounded by some supporting friends who believe in him too. It provides a kind of release he's looking for because he's in a kind of depressing lot within the break-up of his parents and the stifling school and town he lives in. Of course there's a girl because why would you want to be in a band if not for that reason? The phrase 'youth springs eternal' comes to mind and history has proved it to be a powerful catalyst for creativity and change and so it goes here.This is a fine little movie. It is well done though certainly light. It's a bit fantastical to be sure and if one is going to dream isn't it best to take that path? Besides the fine production values for a modest film there's some seriously decent 80's music reflecting much of the times as well as, surprisingly, great original music made for the film. This is a fun and uplifting film for all. It might help to love music though it's certainly not required. Writer/director John Carney obviously birthed this one from the heart and it shows as there's hardly a false step. It's kind of like an indie version of 'That Thing You Do' with a heart first and foremost. I hope this Dublin based production finds a larger audience as it certainly has merit and deserves to be seen. As of early 2017 it's available on several streaming sights so there's hope. Young Ferdia Walsh- Peelo as protagonist Conor deserves special praise as he's immediately likable and pulls the viewer in to story. Simply fun to watch which is a refreshing change from so many dark films of late.",7,1,2,1 February 2017
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," A Worthy & Different Crime Mystery When Compared To American Films Of The Genre
","An intrigue fueled slow building thriller, 'The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo' is a refreshingly different take on the 'whodunit' crime genre. This Swedish movie has loads of great cinematography, taking advantage of the beautiful Swedish country side as well as framing the eerie story. The principal characterizations are quite well suited by the cast who fit naturally in the roles they play with great realism. Like I have already noted this is a much different presentation as compared with American filmed crime thrillers. Even though this obviously has a well-funded budget it is grittier and less commercialized thus lending a realism over glossiness. The music score also adds quite a bit of ominous darkness.I guess if you want to be overly critical you could punch a hole or two here or there, but I think this story comes off so most all viewers will ignore any inconsistencies in favor of the mysterious pieces which, eventually, add up, but not too fast – keeping the viewer invested and hoping to figure out how it may all end.Though graphic at times, it isn't 'porn-horror', 'The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo' is a dark story where the unsettling pieces fit. I am fairly certain it will not be released in the US, but if you can see it do so as it is a well crafted and executed drama.",7,111,140,13 September 2009
Dumb and Dumber," 20 Years Later...Still The Definitive Jim Carey Comedy
","As of mid 2013 this is still Jim Carey's highest rated movie...Believe it! The reason is that it is a perfect palate with his best foil, Jeff Daniels in the co-starring role. Carey has such a unique physical comedy it's a gift and a curse. Though he has proved he can do decent drama, his 'wheelhouse' is assuredly comedy, and all cylinders hit here.Lloyd Christmas is a totally witless loser, except he is so naively innocent that he is lovable...And, damn funny. That is given the right vehicle. Dumb & Dumber is close to that perfect 'ride'. The Farrelley brothers understand how to utilize the special talents of Carey's comedic brilliance. First, they've provided a script that plays to the strengths Carey possesses. Then, they take what would appear to be a left turn and pair him with a formally serious actor, Jeff Daniels, who proves to be the synergistic pairing needed. Daniels shows a 'straight-man' (yet total dumb ass) comedic flair that nobody would guess he had in him. He almost matches Carey and in the process garners unforced knee-slapping laughs.This movie has a real pull for the viewer. Absolutely hilarious sight gags with snappy dead-pan comedic gold dialog delivered perfectly. Add the fantastic backdrop of Aspen, with all of it's pretentiousness for a brilliantly scenic juxtaposition to the low-brow comedy - what you get is an unexpected comedy classic. These guys are better than Martin and Lewis because, mostly, you have two Lewis'! While Martin was the 'cool' in those classic comedies this one uses two comedians and an assortment of 'cool' supporting characters to out-do other classic comedy 'buddy movies'! Even the sophomoric gross stuff rises above the usual into more rarefied air as a result.Nothing can take away from the fun that makes this movie comedic gold. We know in 2014 there will be a sequel. It doesn't matter, like the original Blues Brothers movie, if that sequel works or is an embarrassment. Nothing can take away the 'crown' of this gem. See it again as comedies with so much right like this one are scarce.",7,0,1,30 May 2013
The Boy in the Striped Pajamas," Absurd? What's so absurd about a mirror?
","If you allow yourself to be too pragmatic you'll simply say absurd! If you put history in front of a mirror, which this movie does, you'll say brilliant.In a time when intolerance and chaos seems to be making another great stand the message of this movie cannot be understated. Each one of us is capable of pure evil if we let that element reign...Collectively we must look honestly in the mirror and say: 'NEVER AGAIN'! See this movie, think only about the ultimate lesson and realize that regardless of how based on reality the story itself may be the larger truth is real, it's ugly, and it can be repeated. Film-making does not get much better or even more timely.",9,2,3,24 March 2009
The Imitation Game," Rights History As Well As Stands As A Call For Tolerance
","The story of Alan Turing is both triumphant and tragic. An absolutely brilliant mathematician who morphed into a juggernaut of a electrical engineer, a mechanical engineer, and a transcendent mind as to how best to use the troves of information only he, and his team, deciphered.Turing was deep in the shadows as the intel his team provided turned the war from the darkness of Hitler to victory for the Allies saving millions of lives in the process. He couldn't come out of that shadow as it was mandated his team's work must remain classified. The Imitation Game makes it poignantly clear Turing paid dearly for his crucial part never being celebrated. If his life wasn't difficult enough, being a closet homosexual professor, the laws of Britian made it infinitely more difficult by prosecuting what the law only saw as a common college professor with a lascivious and lewd predilection. The heartbreaking fact of some of the same intolerance Hitler practiced visited a man who should have been celebrated as a national treasure, likely propelling him to suicide, is finally revealed. A colossal irony to be sure. The Imitation Game brings some much needed justice to story of Alan Turing and does so with a very matter-of-fact telling of both the triumph and tragedy of his life.The Imitation Game is a movie that works on virtually all levels. It rights history and reveals much about how one man made a huge impact on winning the war for the Allies. It touches the inner humanity of the viewer as it quite eloquently shows the evil of intolerance toward our fellow human beings. Something many in the world still have not grasped; just today there was a terrible terrorist attack in France. This is a story that needed to be told and the whole of director, cast, cinematography, and production have brilliantly recreated so we can be immersed in, and, hopefully, learn from. A strong contender for academy awards for direction, actor, supporting actress, and best picture, you simply owe it to yourself to see this film.",9,1,6,8 January 2015
Prisoners," An Amazing Dark Abyss
","What happens after a family is shattered by the disappearance of a small child is darkly explored in Prisoners. Keller Dover, played by Hugh Jackman, is on a personal mission to find his daughter before its too late. An old truck camper as mysteriously seen in the Dover's neighborhood reveals an oddball suspect likely purposely named Alex Jones. When the police are forced to let Jones go Dover's obsession to take matters into his own hands quickly spins out of control. This is set against the mystery of Jone's apparently mental deficiency and seemingly innocuous aunt who is his caregiver. The film quickly proceeds painting a dark psychological thriller. Whatever is going on with Alex Jones and his aunt seems more pathetic than threatening even though Jones is most certainly is involved. Caught in the middle is police detective Loki, played by Jake Gyllenhaal. Loki's character is as intense in his will to find the two girls as is Dover's. Clearly, being on two different sides of the law while solving the crime puts Dover and Loki at odds with one another. The performances by Jackman and Gyllenhaal are such that these two create a mountain of tension on an already 'edge of your seat' atmosphere created by the writers and pounded home by the excellent atmospherically dark location shooting.Brilliantly, Prisoners doesn't give up too much as it builds a bleak picture of how all approach the battle of good versus evil. Moral questions swirl like black storm clouds touching all involved. This is a complex crime thriller that makes the viewer uneasy for the entire ride. It has a feel of realism and intellectualism while being 100% accessible save for the dread feeling of depravity which makes watching akin to witnessing a macabre disaster. In this regard one wants to look away, but simply can't. Prisoners achieves everything it sets out to with a cast non-parallel who all give uniformly excellent performances (i.e.the best ever from Jackman and Gyllenhaal to date). The supporting cast is above all scrutiny with spot-on direction and cinematography combining to weave superlatively written story never veering too far out or even feeling remotely like a crime story retread. This is a highly recommended movie - a must see.",8,1,1,4 December 2013
Logan," The Best Marvel Movie Adaptation
","Logan makes The Terminator a bore in comparison. It's that good. Jackman, Stewart, & Dafne Keen turn in perfect performances.

Hotel Mumbai," Excruciating Violence Creates Palpable Tension
","Ignore the negative reviews. This movie creates a horrific tension of senseless violent death dealt by brainwashed drones of a hijacked group of young zealots. It's down to good versus evil as closely to how it played out while still being a movie. It gets across the paralyzing uncertainly of those spared the initial wave of killing as to what to do next. Hotel Mumbai is a tense and excruciating emotional ride soon enough as the slow start is soon forgotten. The civilized world is far too often simply not prepared, often in a state of denial. Tragedy arrives just as shown here - and there's no do-over making this a painfully important film with a steep learning curve. I hope everyone sees this.",8,16,31,21 June 2019
Elysium," New World Order Cesspool Without Redemption
","Taking a particularly bleak picture of a future-time new world order to a sci-fi extreme is interesting in itself. Elysium starts with that expansive premise yet fails on a level of character and story development. What it does excel at is the actual CGI creation of the two polar opposite worlds. The effects are the one outstanding character if you will.Max, played extremely straightforward by Damon, is born into a cruel earth where the 'haves' have all left for the artificial outer space habitat of Elysium. Those left on earth suffer under the rule of Elysium's android enforcers. Max was raised in a sort of religious orphanage and as a young adult turned to crime which resulted in his incarceration and subsequent release on a tight leach. We can not feel much of a connection with Max as everything feels rushed.Through a chance meeting with Max's only childhood love/acquaintance a back story is clumsily thrust on the viewer. As Max struggles to keep out of prison, as well as to remain employed at the 'evil' android factory, this connection with his long lost love/friend Frey gives Max the only hope for anything remotely resembling a shred of human emotion. Due to the fast pacing, and the resistance of Frey whose only mission is to find a cure for her mortally ailing daughter, the Max/Frey relationship doesn't get much traction. Strangely, the viewer is left without much of an investment in these characters we're suppose to feel, and root, for.Max suffers a massive dose of radiation at work which is said to give him 5-days left to live. Max sets out on a 'failure-is-not-an-option' mission to reach Elysium where any affliction can be miraculously healed. Of course, time is short thus the movie ramps up its already fast pace. It's action from here on out which showcases the dazzling CGI generated backdrop without apology to advancing the viewer's relationship with protagonist Max or others. When Max gets wounded in the process of honoring his deal made in order to assume a false identity and trip to Elysium with the resistance. Seeking his nurse friend Frey for medical attention he waits outside the hospital she works at. Again, Max is a wanted criminal thus Frey must attend to him at her home. At Frey's home Max learns her young daughter is stricken with leukemia and she, too, needs the healing only possible on Elysium. Max seems hard hearted here as Frey pleads for him to take her daughter saying even if he could take the child she'd be rejected because she has no I.D. on Elysium. Strangely, until Frey's daughter recites a tale involving an insect and a hippo a much needed investment in our characters finally occurs. This little story, as told by the child, connects us to the characters on a small scale and totally re-purposes Max as to save Frey's daughter.Here, the story again veers toward seems clumsiness as the writers have chosen to use an implanted computer program in Max's head. It feels hurriedly concocted since it Max would have enough trouble getting to Elysium without it simply because there's battle between a resistance movement seeking freedom from Elysium's murderous/oppressive rule which the face of is Elysium's director of security played by Jodie Foster. Ms. Foster has never been more bland than in her character here. It isn't a character so much as a human android, even so Ms. Foster simply sleepwalks the part. More memorable is her head henchman. A mouthy white South African low-life, he adds some needed color if it's one dimensional. Capturing Max, Frey, and Frey's daughter the goon is being dispatched to Elysium where the program inside of Max;s brain can be downloaded (delivered) to Ms. Foster's character who can use it to ascend to leadership among the sharks she works under. Now, this story is by the numbers and without creative character development things feel predictable beyond reason. Still, when you accept the ride the CGI effects and action keep pushing things along. What could have been brilliant sci-fi is sorely reduced to passable and sometimes good. This movie is worth seeing by those highly addicted to science fiction, not so much by others, however. Matt Damon does all he's asked for, but the usual high level of charisma he possesses is simply squashed. For lovers of science fiction it is still a safe bet, but for the mainstream who likes their sci-fi with a healthy dose of human interest Elysium largely fails. Therefore, Elysium will be largely panned by the public at large. I'd give it a 5 which simply must be raised to a six based on the CGI alone.",6,0,1,30 November 2013
There's Something About Mary," A Comedy I Absolutely Love
","This movie needs another review like California needs a drier climate. Seriously, I can't help myself because this might just be my favorite comedy of all time.This is the perfect storm of political incorrectness matching the talents of Ben Stiller, Matt Dillon, Chris Elliott,Cameron Diaz, and The Farrelly Brothers hitting everyone's sweet-spot all at once. Then there's the devices of Jonathan Richman's surreal interjection and the musical soundtrack itself. What a great atmosphere to spring a hilarious story from! Plus, for all the 'take no prisoner's' satire there's an actual heart too. The movie moves quite well as it paints loser Ted growing up, finding his love, tripping everything up (as expected, yet hilariously not as expected), and never forgetting aboutMary. The journey he takes is absolute gold. So many funny things making repeated viewing not just mandatory, but even better.Now, I think I must admit this kind of comedy isn't so wonderfully entertaining to everyone. In fact, it's kind of a cult group who, many years later, still count this as a comedic watershed moment. But, if you like it in the first 15-minutes then it just gets better and you know who you are. I wish this kind of magic could be more of regular thing. I mean The Farrelly's were really on to something here. I've enjoyed many of their other movies such as Dumb and Dumber and Me, Myself, and Irene (this one almost as much). But, as of 2014 the latest version of D&DTo (liked it well enough, not great though) makes it clear there's been a big void in the years since. I'll just watch this again to help fill it in! It's that good in my humble opinion.",9,1,1,13 August 2015
It's a Wonderful Life," A 2019 Review I Hope You'll Read
","Why would I even think about adding another review to one of the most reviewed movies on IMDB. In a word, emotions. Few films I've ever seen evoke the inner feeling I experience when I watch It's A Wonderful Life. In fact I can't think of any even close.Capra's film is a masterpiece of humanity and spirituality. And it's light as a feather never preachy or heavy-handed. If a person seeing this can't get in touch with some deep inner joy of love and life it's probably a sign of some psychopathic character flaw. This movie celebrates the power within to overcome even when we all have flaws and weaknesses which if we allow do much the opposite. It's a fantastic journey of a life with roads not taken in while keeping an eye on what unites us all.Jimmy Stewart will forever have my awe and appreciation for his portrayal of George Bailey. George is waging war with a powerful foe. He's doing it for the right reasons and Stewart always allows the frail human side to walk hand in hand with the focused true believer. It's a powerful juxtaposition that mimics the eternal struggle of good and evil. It has never been presented in celluloid more masterfully and in such a way as to shoot straight to the heart. The entire cast is uniformly excellent in creating a microcosm of so many elements of mankind's struggle. It is not simply a journey of light either as there are many dark turns. In the end though it affirms a belief in man as a spiritual creation that can, with faith, rise and conquer darkness. I love this movie. It's a Christmas Classic that is an all-time great. So great it's my single favorite movie and I suspect it is others too and will continue to be this kind of film to even unborn generations. Yes, it is that WONDERFUL!",10,1,1,3 December 2019
American Made," Seal Is Still Unknown To Most Americans...This Will Change That & Everyone Should Know About Seal & Mena
","f you're like me you want to know more about Barry Seal. Short of conspiracy videos I've not had a lot of success save for Daniel Hopsicker's film which I did find scattered if informative...still heavy with conspiracy stuff yet has a ring of truth. Now we get the big one: The made for your entertainment Hollywood version. It's definitely good enough it should find an audience, having Tom Cruise paints Seal more as a likable criminal. Seal as pawn playing all sides like they were playing him to which he might as well make some major bank. But, the thing that shouldn't get lost is that this is about a man who really lived and a government agency that absolutely ran amok. Lives were lost and destroyed to which we really don't see that to any extent here. This fairly spit, polished, and filtered version based on the book American Made gives what I would term a peek at the top as it never delves too deeply in favor of pure entertainment..Is it entertaining to see a man get himself into the most unimaginable situation where you go from driving a bus in the sky for TWA to having so much much money you can't find enough banks or buildings to put store it in? Why yes it is! And the way Tom mugs for a videocassette camera retelling his story is interlaced (Seal may have actually done this for many reasons including his own safety) between scenes of outlandish occurrences and action as Barry Seal's unique criminal empire is pretty much built by The CIA. We know that part of this is absolutely true so it's not very hard to question anything here and it's often better than fiction.This movie is filmed wonderfully with some action that includes a harrowing short runway takeoff high in the Columbian mountains. They did a fantastic job of filming this and as well as a later controlled ditching. I think it shows that Cruise is a pilot himself as the detail is impressive. I recommend this movie. This is close to the story of the century since the aliens haven't yet landed. Who in The CIA thought this up? Who gave it the green light? Are these people psychopaths? The fact they did and got a colorful character like Seal almost demands further investigation, but for now here's the big-screen sanitized entertaining version and it's pretty good.",7,1,3,22 October 2017
Steve Jobs," Bicycles For Humanity...And Maximum Profit.
","Steven Jobs plays out like a four-act play with each act being a product launch. The associated side stories take precedence over actual launch events, they're just a clever device used to tell the story. This isn't a movie about science and technology, rather about a spectacularly flawed, brilliant, and undeniably narcissistic visionary. I purposely do not use the term genius which I think, too many documentaries regarding Jobs have posited.The structure of the movie works because of the way it allows one to see inside the tumultuous battles of Jobs, with his employees, the Apple board, and his daughter (and her mother), They existed side by side, and, strangely, this enabled the viewer to be appalled for the most part while still, on occasion, feeling a strange empathy.This isn't a feel good movie. It doesn't over celebrate even the fact Jobs lead Apple back from being one quarter from oblivion. It probably even barely shows how difficult Jobs was. It seems to accomplish a lot by not trying to do a lot in the final analysis. Fine performances from Kate Winslet (assistant Joanna Hoffman), Seth Rogen (Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak), Jeff Daniels (Apple CEO John Sculley), and three young actresses playing Job's daughter Lisa Brennan bring these integral people to a seldom seen place where they live and breathe. You can feel their anger and frustration with Jobs who they should have all turned away from, but couldn't. This is a very small window into the darkly inexplicable side of the man who brought us products we never knew we needed so much - until he showed us we did.",7,2,5,24 December 2015
Edge of Tomorrow," Recycled Theme? No Problem 'Cause It Works.
","First, this is a good Sci-Fi. The movie gets to it too as whoever the aliens are need not be explained as what's important is they're here and they're on the brink of eliminating mankind. The CGI effects are definitely 'perfect' here as we get really original bad-ass aliens and well realized battle scenes with them.Then there's the compelling differences. One big one, and it ain't even original, is the premise of replaying the day as per Groundhog Day. It doesn't ever feel recycled though and it is the absolute core of the story. Perhaps the biggest difference is we get a Tom Cruise character that isn't in any way a typical summer 'money-grab' cut-out: cooler than cool character. We get a real Sci-Fi anomaly whose persona is in a desperate situation and he plays it perfectly. PR officer Bill Cage, Cruise's character, is suddenly thrust into a major front line battle situation in which he, quite accidentally, becomes the one valiant person who can divert humankind's demise. He gets some nice support by a very physical woman warrior played by Emily Blunt and an obliviously gung-ho Master Sargent Farrell Bill Paxton (he drank much Cool-Aid).So, if you enjoy 'nasty' (i.e., big and good action) Sci-Fi this ones got you covered. The living the day over thing is treated with both humor and that needed tiny crack of hope in that outcomes actually can be changed by extraordinary means.",8,1,3,12 July 2014
Whiplash," Is Greatness Achievable Without Adversity?
","That J.K Simmons is a versatile character actor is a given. Simmons, as a kind of 'second banana' comedic foil has elevated just about everything he has been used in this guise for. But, Simmons is also an exceptional dramatic actor too when given the right part. Whiplash gives Simmons the part that should remove any doubt about him being able to bring a character you love to hate to a kind of artistic visceral reality. Simply put, Whiplash couldn't rise to the rare air the story aspires for without such a performance.No man is an island and though, the screenplay and the direction by Damien Chazelle is succinct in totally building a great story without anything superfluous. This is a movie with a powerful statement about humanity never veering into the maudlin. The seriousness of this straightforwardly told story is brilliant and never fails to entertain. It's anything but boring no matter if you give a whit about jazz music which is really not central at all. It's about the intersection of beliefs, self-doubt, and will to overcome whatever may come finding something held deep and dear. Collateral damage is often painful, raising questions of social morality which is to say; it's complicated just like the real life it portrays.Whiplash poses a big question: are some of history's greatest men and women destined to be all they become or are they ripe for something that pushes, changes, them to achieve it? If one is a student of history it seems it is very much the combination of certain events placed before a person, inherent brilliance not withstanding, that molds the final result. Along the way, many times, the great person must reclaim their humanity as the price they've paid may have stripped them of so much. Only by finally espousing internal peace can the person have the combination of immortal-like greatness and a well lived life. Even fewer achieve this than greatness itself. Whiplash intrigues the viewer, while being extremely entertaining and moving, to ponder this. Saving this for last, newcomer Miles Teller is not only utterly fantastic in his role of Andrew Neiman, the protagonist, but is one hell of drummer, apparently, too. He nails the role all around. A great movie, highly recommended.",8,1,2,15 January 2015
The Wolf of Wall Street," Debauchery As Entertainment
","Scorcesse must be in his element relating a sordid tale of Wall Street criminals because he cloaks the massive amount of depravity as entertainment as only he can do. He gets maximum help by a stellar performance by Leonardo DiCapprio who easily makes the amped-up story of Jordan Belfort more than palatable.It's not easy to admit this film is enjoyable entertainment because at the end of the day it glorifies some of humanities worst possible turns. As if gobs of money makes evil somehow noble. Obviously, this was the goal and to that Scorcesse has perfected it. Simply put, without DiCapprio's likable persona this may have been too dark to stomach. Way too much illicit sex, drugs, and stealing glossed over to readily accept...Except there's DiCapprio's way with the viewer which somehow makes one watch in spite of what you know is all wrong. Though in a year of lesser movies this could give DiCapprio an Oscar there is some justice in knowing this year a caricature of white collar evil, no matter how good, won't achieve that glorification.Yes, there is gallant stabs at real comedy relief here. It works, along with DiCapprio's role, to keep the disgust guarded. But, in reality there's a sordid tale here that is shown in horrific grandiosity with soft porn and drug glorification hovering. In the end it leaves the viewer feeling dirty as slight justice was served and so much bad seemed to be made light of. One question remains...Whatever happened to Steve Madden who likely profited from his mass sell-off, but disappeared???",6,4,7,9 January 2014
American Gangster," Keeps The Viewer Involved And Interested....Well Done.
","The story about Frank Lucas is one that proves fact is more interesting than fiction. The fact that such a character really did exist yet I do not remember it certainly intrigues me. I guess I was just too young at the time it broke. Now approaching my later forties finds me longing to research it further after seeing this movie.I get the feeling Ridley Scott was amazed a person such as Frank Lucas was actually able to do what he did and live to tell about it. I certainly share that amazement. The care in which he tells the story serves it well. Though it's basically a gangster movie it's not particularly graphic in violence except in a few scenes. Even Denzel's and Russel's portrayals of the two central characters are not quite as dark as the usual more stereotypical gangster/cop persona...Still there is a sense of doom and danger ever present as the viewer knows neither law enforcement, government, or mafia will let this man's drug empire go on.To sum it up I believe this is an excellent telling of a true crime story. It's intriguing, entertaining, and certainly serves as a cautionary reminder to remain vigilant in combating drugs.",9,135,211,26 October 2007
Kingpin," So Good It Elevates Politically Incorrect Comedy To Shakespearian Levels
","If there is a category for college alternative movies, like music, I nominate the Farrelly Brothers. They're just 'off' enough that their humor while often silly is whip-smart wicked funny. That means these guys are deftly talented. They can take liberties that in lesser hands would likely fall flat even being offensive. Instead they masterfully manipulate stupid and offensive into hilarious comedy as their debut with Dumb and Dumber hit big proving. So here we have a similar formula of two uncool guys on a wacky adventure Smartly, however, they are not even close in disposition and are serendipitously brought together by the most uncool sport on planet earth: professional bowling. These little differences make King Pin a superior film to the mega-successful Dumb & Dumber.In King Pin amidst all of the possibly sharply barbed satire there is a real heart of humanity. It hovers at different times and makes an excellent sum in the unexpected ending. I always love the Farrelly Brothers pop music sound tracks and it's excellent here. They often weave in overlooked gems that are so cool and well placed. When a soundtrack elevates the proceedings it actually affects the storyline masterfully. Speaking of masterfully. Woody Harrelson plays his role of Munson so well it appears we're seeing an actual person as the actor melts into the part. It is exceptional to do this with the portrayal of a downer character playing comedy wrapped in equal parts spiraling down and barely hanging on all the while retaining a sliver of hope. Munson as a character does all this for which you can't help love the loser. What's a loser without an evil foil? That is provided in superlative fashion by none other than the slimy comedic excellence of Bill Murray as profession bowling's reining kingpin 'Big Ern'. I simply cannot imagine this working so well without Bill Murray's role. He's an absolutely perfect slime ball. Then there's the glue which binds these character's together and it's Randy Quaid. Quaid playing the Amish 'kid' turns in one of his finest portrayals of a character, ever. Whatever happened to him in later life he had acting chops to play an utterly ridiculous role and do so in such a natural way it seems, again, that the actor faded into a very real misfit. Vanessa Angel as the femme fatale is so right her unlikely pairing with Munson and 'The Kid' never feels wrong in spite of it being wholly unthinkable. What's happening here? It's a mini-masterpiece of left-field comedy is what.",8,0,1,15 December 2019
Hancock," Superhero Turned Upside-down
","What if society's superhero was endowed with superpower yet was on the fringe of society as a marginally functioning person. A street type who bungled his miraculous feats, saving innocent lives but with always with enormous collateral damage. Sounds like a great twist that begged for a real visionary celluloid treatment...I am just guessing here, but I imagine that the producers thought something which resembled this. Reinventing the genre. Brilliant! Right? In order to guarantee a degree of success, regardless of all other factors, they (producer/director) knew they needed something of a chameleon 'A-List' actor. They got Will Smith, and when you think about it for ten seconds you have to think, of course, who else? Who besides Will breaches comedy, drama, and science fiction with so much credibility? They got it right here I would say.So why isn't it an unqualified success? It has to come down to the actual story and not the ideal itself. The aspect they chose to key on was the rehabilitation of Hancock. A sort of 'My Fair Lady' theme within the movie itself. With Justin Bateman as his conscience/public relations manager we are dragged into the rehabilitation of Hancock. This, in this reviewer's opinion, is where the story constricts itself. The idea of Hancock wanting to be a complete person in the most moral sense isn't in itself the pitfall. If he did not see his dark side and desire to save himself as well he wouldn't be the different superhero and thus would not be of any interest outside of being a Superman by another name. So it boils down to the actual screenplay and overall writing as the lesser of all the ingredients. While the special effects are, as expected, extreme. I think the story did not live up to the idea. Somewhere at an hour and change we get an interesting twist and that is the fact that Justin Bateman's wife, played by Charlize Theron, is also endowed with superpowers. So, now the story is going to ramp up and get really interesting. Unfortunately not so much. In the end another turn that really does not serve the original idea to the extent it deserves.This movie is watchable and even enjoyable. It could have been so much more and therein lies that twinge of discontent. I would say great idea, good cast, and lots of possibilities muddled by story that is weak and execution which simply can't save that weakness.",6,1,1,14 July 2008
12 Strong," Much Better Than The Negative Reviews
","12 Strong is based on truth and it would seem that in itself goes a long way as it took until a decade later for this story to become known through the book on which it was based. Quite simply it deserves the big screen treatment as it was a first victory in a war which goes on as I write this. The heroism is off the charts as everything changed the minute the 12 dropped in. Importantly the movie gets this point across. If it often seems like a lunatic's gamble as the small group of 12 immediately were split due the lack of trust by the Northern Alliance's war lord. Again the movie pulls no Hollywood bombast in depicting this. It seems like even our supposed allies are so distrustful the operation is doomed. As far as the battle scenes go there's that suspicion it may have received some of the Hollywood action movie push. I say don't over analyze this as it gets the point across of how desperate the situation really was and how focused, disciplined, and well trained our brave 12 were. The bottom line is this is a good homage based on real events and that always hovers large. If it could have been better depicted I'm certainly not sure exactly how as the victory was near impossible and that is captured on film quite realistically. I have nothing but praise for these fearless 12 warriors and I'm proud their story is now displayed for all of us who they put it over the line for. See the film and don't pick it apart, rather, be proud there is another great generation and just be glad we have soldiers like these 12.",7,137,276,5 April 2018
Sherlock Holmes," Old Classic Revamped Reverently
","Guy Ritchie's 'Sherlock Holmes' is a throwback to the old Saturday afternoon mystery serial..Except it ain't no serial, it's a blockbuster. Yes, it's delightfully fully blown and over-the-top in scope and execution – and it works delightfully for the adventure as well as the Sherlock Holmes fan alike.The story revolves around a most dark and sinister villain, Lord Blackwood, who is out to conquer the British Parliament and, yes, the world. When Blackwood mysteriously rises from his own execution, well, it provides just the perfect storm of fear from which Sherlock Holmes surely cannot resist. Oh, but one should never underestimate what Holmes will deduce given his uncanny scientific mind. This is the setup and what follows, though quite Hollywood in both effects and glamor, still manages to serve a classic because the story is worthy of the characters of both Holmes and Watson. Mr. Ritchie's dark and gritty style of film-making surprisingly works quite nicely.Perhaps no surprise is Robert Downey Jr.'s performance as Sherlock Holmes. Downey's portrayal propels the disheveled detective to new heights and remains true to Arthur Conan Doyle's literary icon. I get the feeling this will likely stand with the classic Basil Rathbone celluloid version for old viewers while bringing 'the franchise' up to date, if you will, to legions of new fans. Lord Blackwood, played by Mark Strong, is also close to perfection as he is evil without being cartoon-ish (nice restraint on Strong's part). If that isn't enough Jude Law mostly does the same for Dr. Watson and the somewhat greater role Mr. Ritchie envisioned for Watson seems to be on the mark as Downey and Law pair well, elevating the charisma of both through their natural chemistry. The backdrop of Old London is created and photographed so seamlessly it's hard to tell what's real or digital – the setting is so realistic it simply couldn't be better.So here we have a very good update that gives a nod to the classic nature of the material, the beloved Saturday afternoon movie serial, and brings the action level up-to-date while keeping the effects from stealing anything away. If you think this sounds a bit too implausible you should simply see it, in factSee it if you don't. Recommended.",8,1,2,20 March 2010
The Big Short," Entertaining Movie Expose Corruptness Eisenhower Warned Us Of
","Did you lose everything in 2007? Probably not, but you lost a ton anyway and here's a movie that sheds some light on how much that was. Oh yeah, if your tax money, and lots more printed just for the heck of it, didn't shore up the international banking economy you'd be looking at all your former bank account balances at ZERO.Adam McKay and Charles Randolph's 'Big Short' is a Cliff Notes like distilled version of what was going on in the American Banking Industry in early 2004. Things had become so obviously 'short' that few could actually see how criminal the whole system had become. But, like in everything...there were those who actually saw how corrupt things were. And, there were a few of these 'visionaries' that gambled on the fact that there would be a day of final honesty whereby the fake rated investments would have to revealed for the worthlessness that they really were.This is a movie that is ruthlessly brilliant. It really doesn't hit you over the head with the fact our whole banking system is totally corrupt...nope, it slowly allows you to question it and come up with your own conclusion. Kennedy knew something when he began to print money not tied to a system that was hopelessly based on criminal quackery, but, wait, he was assassinated. And years later we have this. We also have a generation of hard working Americans whose nest-egg was obliterated in a few days. A government that is perpetually at war, as well as not subservient to the average citizen, because the warning Dwight D. Eisenhower gave us wasn't really taken to heart and didn't include the Federal Reserve. This movie exposes the greatest threat to the American Dream and it ain't got a damn thing to do with Communism. To bad there wasn't a second American Revolution, one that finally righted a sinking ship. This movie makes that fact woefully clear and it is absolutely brilliant in that it is highly understated and wonderfully entertaining. Alan Grenspan should by any measure of a honest system be in prison and if he sang like a canary the depth of it would be so profound our monetary system would have to be rebuilt from the ground up instead of letting guiltless millions bear the brunt of a totally fake monetary system propping it up. You can't write fiction this unbelievable, but you can get a movie that distills it down to two hours. Take note: our current economy has nothing except intention backing it up. Let's hope China never calls our bluff.",9,8,9,9 January 2016
The Greatest Showman," A Magical Musical That May Be The Best In Celluloid History
","He Greatest Showman is moviemaking without a net (no pun intended) in the most wonderful way. I truly am taken back by the talented mind that envisioned this and had the bravery to go for it in a way that made me think Walt Disney's magic was once again summoned. From the start to finish this is an amazing musical. The story is both whimsical and moving. The music and dancing is of the highest caliber and tells the story as much as the dialog. All actors are superb in their roles to a point that almost defies reason. And it is all presented in the most spectacular cinematography which becomes a crucial player in it's breathtaking palate of composition, lighting, and color. Bravo! A real creative masterpiece. This is truly something special and not to be missed. I've often said I don't want to be friends with anyone that doesn't love dogs and The Beatles, now I can add those that do not see the amazing wonder of The Greatest Showman.",10,2,5,13 March 2018
Midway," Hollywood Finally Makes A War Movie Close To Perfect
","The only thing I feel compelled to add to the many reviews here is that the composite score as of early 2020 is off...way off. I admit it is shy of a 7 which generally means quite good. Quite good, however, is off. This is wholly excellent. History is respected with accuracy, the amazing resolve and bravery of the pilots is given proper homage, and the story doesn't add any superfluous elements The U.S. victory at Midway is one of our country's finest moments militarily period. It came at a crucial time at a tremendous cost of life and risk. I believe this is a rare movie that deserves a rare rating here. This is my sole reason for adding my thoughts.",10,2,2,25 January 2020
RED," Ridiculous...Entertaining...Delightful...RED is all this.!
","When Bruce Willis plays his indestructible yet on the surface everyday guy he is right where the audience loves him. In RED, 'Retired Extremely Dangerous', he has a close to perfect vehicle. And, so RED delivers in spite of a fairly ridiculous scenario of a group of ex-CIA operatives,or which Willis is one, being singled out for execution on the eve of the vice-president announcing his candidacy for president.We get the message from the first that Willis is somewhat lonely and bored with retirement and is searching for a companion to make his new life matter. He isn't aching to get back to fast track, but is venerable and is fixated on a kind and cheery voice on the other end of the phone line when he complains about not getting his pension checks (he tears them up just to talk to his 'handler'). He arranges a meeting with the sweet sounding gal just prior to everything falling apart because the CIA sends in a 'wet' team to erase him. As suspected the CIA, as well as most all the resources of the government, are not up to the task.Willis reassembles his old team, all in his age bracket or older, in order to survive. That team, if not on the surface a formidable threat, is pure cinematic gold as it consists of excellent performances by Morgan Freeman, John Malkovich, and Helen Mirren. It is almost impossible not to like this film because of the wonderfully entertaining supporting cast. In fact Malkovich steals the show providing the correct dosage of crazed comic relief. This leads to impossible feats making for deliciously served up entertainment; all with a 'nod-and-a-wink' that cuts through the unbelievable. Great action with comedy! Richard Dreyfus turns in a solid performance as a spoiled smart-ass (uber-wealthy and powerful) arms dealer who pulls strings behind the scenes. And, Ernest Borgnine has a cameo role which is memorable.It's a character driven action comedy that truly is RED (ridiculous, entertaining, delightful). This movie gets a 7.5 and, as such, is hard to fault in spite of being pure light-weight fluff. See it and smile.",7,195,244,15 October 2010
Flight," Dark Hero Has To Pay For Wrong To Make Right
","Sometimes we believe those at the top of the chain are some kind of super humans, you know as in who am I to question a doctor of medicine for example. Truth is no matter how high one functions, that person is still a fallible human being. Flight is a look into man, who even as he surely saved lives in a situation where he was not at fault, ultimately failed himself as well as countless others. If this sounds uncomfortably powerful you sense the core of what makes the movie Flight, staring Denzel Washington, worth your time to watch and, hopefully, ponder.Could a plane accident be avoided by better engineering of a several hundred dollar part? Could the strictest maintenance procedures correctly adhered to circumvent a preventable accident? Does any of this matter if the pilot of a doomed airliner performs a miracle of flying, one where many lives saved, yet said pilot is performing while under the influence of alcohol and drugs? These are the questions the viewer is forced to ruminate over. There is great discomfort involved because Denzel Washington's excellent portrayal of an equally likable/detestable flawed human being, who willingly has taken on this responsibility, but has miserably failed even while he has performed a statistically impossible miracle.Flight is in no way a typical Hollywood vehicle for anyone. It is a picture of grievous loss in which innocent people are caught, some even dying. Flight isn't pleasant, but it is extremely compelling in its nakedness of the reality of the human condition. Big business makes less than perfect airplanes, airlines do not always do everything possible to catch impending disasters, and finally those in positions of utter infallibility still fail. Sometimes all of the above come tragically together for an outcome. Flight is the story of a very real possibility of this. I applaud all involved, especially director Robert Zemeckis and actor Denzel Washington (who turns in a performance worth of a Oscar), for bringing a extremely upsetting portrait of the confluence of events resulting in a absolutely avoidable tragedy.Saving for the last, and quite powerful in its compactness, is a scene with Denzel, imprisoned yet finally being free of his addictions, begins to bond with the son he never really knew. A short segment that speaks volumes about a man facing his demons and starting to heal. This movie is worthy of your time, a powerful study in human frailty - don't miss it.",9,1,2,23 December 2012
The Hangover Part III," Skip This & Watch The Original If You Must
","This movie starts out lame...I mean a giraffe getting beheaded? It would take a master of scripts to make this somehow funny. It's a foreboding because the rut this digs the rest of the movie wallows in.The four 'buddies' had chemistry in the first installment of 'The Hangover'...So, what the hell happened? A money grab, pure and simple. No creativity in the writing and what director could save this screenplay is beyond human understanding.The fat bearded guy needs an intervention. The three other 'Wolf Packers' volunteer. They never get where they're going because of 'circumstances' involving Chow and some garbage about his gold brick heist. John Goodman plays a mobster whose henchmen run the Wolf Pack down and kidnap them. The sweet guy ends up a hostage until the others find Chow and the missing loot.Let's go to Mexico and find Chow because The Mob always hires idiots to do this kind of work. You know the Wolf Pack, in it's sophistication, are experts at not only finding Chow when The Mob can't, but retrieving the gold...Yeah! Well, just in case this doesn't prime the machine isn't it a good idea that Chow double-crosses The Wolf Pack in order for the movie to shift to good 'ol VEGAS!Sad to say, but nothing works here. There is so little humor that hits this is more like a study 'why sequels suck'! This is the rare movie that probably will have a blockbuster first weekend and won't last three. Not only that, it's so lackluster on-demand and DVD sales will likely tank too just due to word-of-mouth. Yes, it is that bad. This is the 'Heaven's Gate' of sequels (pure $#!+). If you must see it find a way to do so at no expense to yourself...That way the only thing you've wasted is time.",5,1,2,3 June 2013
The Nice Guys," A Good Pairing Hampered By Weak Script
","I think one either likes this movie quite well or feels like it was a much larger opportunity missed. For this viewer it was the latter. As the movie began I felt it had promise especially because Russell Crowe was likable slug Nick Nolte type and I liked his character. The film has a definite film noir nod, but it's a late 70's period buddy crime flick to be more precise. It does try to inject continuous comedy, but none of it is knee-slapping funny as it's more of a low-key, fairly constant, comedy. The story is pretty lame which is the main (only) problem. A young woman, Amelia Kuttner, whose mother is the head of the justice department (Kim Bassinger playing Judith Kuttner) seeks to reveal her mom is corrupt in letting the Big 3 auto makers off the hook for pollution. Think that doesn't sound stupid, well the vehicle to reveal all this malfeasance is an 'art house porn' flick staring the daughter. The inane reason for this was to shame the mother and get the maximum exposure only a porn movie could get? This is all while the porn industry in LA starts having mysterious deaths, including the top star, the top director, and this art house porn ,wanna be, director, With the last one the Amelia Kuttner film aimed at her mother's corruption goes missing. This is, basically, the mystery our two needy private eyes must unravel: find Amelia and the film. Oh, and stay alive since death seems to swirl around lately. Speaking of the twosome, I also like Ryan Gosling's acting and the character he plays. I found the young lady playing his daughter quite talented in her role. However, I do still get a bit uncomfortable seeing an impressionable youth in the middle of quite a bit of depravity being depicted. Since her dad (Gosling) is a bit of drunk she actually looks more after him than he does her. So I guess it serves that purpose, but I'm still a bit uncomfortable.Well, this is, in my opinion, a weak buddy movie from a director who is known to be capable of better. Maybe he did as much as he could given the story since - as stated earlier: the story is weak. A viewer could do worse for an evening's entertainment. Make sure your expectations aren't too high and the film is still watchable. I know because I appropriately lowered mine and kept watching. It is a good pairing of two quite different actors, also at very different points in their careers, allowing them to create two interesting disparate fun characters. I just felt the story did the characters potential more of a disservice than a benefit. This pairing could have yielded much better given the right script. One last note to casting director, though both Kim Bassinger and Matt Bomer have a kind of star power, she is plain wrong, plus terrible, here and he is way too opposite the type of a hit man.",5,27,50,14 August 2016
Mad Max: Fury Road," Movie Making At It's Purest...Just Breakdown & Go See It!
","I guess you could say my interest in Mad Max movies is non-existent. At 55, I've never seen any of the previous ones even though I watched my share of movies during the VHS years of which the original was a breakout hit. So, why now am I not only watching a MadMax movie, but reviewing it? Simply because I'm guessing there are others not unlike me.I like a good action movie or sci-fi flick and often watch ones I feel are over-ambitious ending up flat. Especially some that require total belief suspension which are, in my opinion, harder to pull off. With that in mind I wouldn't have desired to see the latest Mad Max movie as I had nothing invested in the franchise previously. What changed my mind is I kept hearing on multiple TV shows positive diatribes on the movie. After decades of being immune I broke. You know what? I really enjoyed it.This is pure movie making because the story isn't at all creative or, really, even compelling. The acting isn't anything special either though I realize some probably differ in my opinion. What is special is the sum of dramatic local vistas, unique characters brought to life, and a constant pummeling action that hardly lets up. This is what makes the movie so edgy and fun to watch. Here's some writers who found the right director and cinematographer to make a completely unbelievable storyline work due to 'hand-in- glove' synergism. The props are 'off-the-hook' as if someones drug-addled imagination came to life on the screen. I didn't feel I was 'dumbed-down' either as I watched this. It's a kind of grand 'steam-punk' industrial art movie discussed as a an action movie. So, here I am telling you other resisters to break down and go see a movie I'd never thought I'd even want to see. That's excellent movie making!",8,2,12,1 June 2015
Hacksaw Ridge," Important History & Gibson's Finest Hour As A Director
","Mel Gibson has become an enigma. I mean he started out a charismatic face, became an OK actor as he went, switched more to directing, even making some amazingly powerful movies. But, he seemed to become quite weird in his personal life. It kind of made you wonder if was just heading out in space? Well, with Hacksaw Ridge he's grounded more than he's ever been. Grounded in a great WWII story well told. It will please a large audience and without controversy.Gibson has brought the story of Desmond Doss, the first and only conscientious objector in the armed forces ever to win the Medal of Honor. It's a story that deserves widespread attention even this many years later. One might think that it was simple for Gibson to make since the story is the thing. True, the story is the anchor, but getting the power of it to the screen told straight without Hollywood bombast is what I believe Gibson should be credited for. There is some amazing cinematography here that is quite visceral and harrowing. And the choice of Andrew Garfield as Doss seals the deal. This is a movie that is entertaining even in it's violence. That's really an amazing thing to pull off. It's uplifting even as it is surrounded in darkness because it has a real feel that you're watching important history which you might not realize the gravity of unless you see it like this. It's a proud achievement and it really is special in many ways. Highly recommended for all.",Null,1,4,26 January 2017
13 Hours," Costly Fail On Hilary's Watch
","You know what's funny? Kids are still kids and they'll be so in the biggest stank hole on earth. You see this in Benghazi, a particularly stinky hole. Strange as it seems there's some people attracted to shitty patches of earth. It could be the pay is good, or it could be it next to the wild west (when it was really wild) it's just as wild (i.e. bad). So it isn't strange a certain kind of a ex-military guy might end up in such a place. Now, if you wanted another slice of danger, just for kicks, you might end up under the overall command of a CIA director who thinks he can use this job as his last 'easy out' before retirement. What this means, largely, is to ignore all the real threats as much as possible. Stay real peaceful while still conducting some 'official' business. That'd be good if the locals weren't a mishmash of killers armed with the spoils of Khaddafi's military weapon's cache. Sounds like a lethal pro1blem ignored until it can no longer, simply, be ignored. Never underestimate a clueless leader who has little pull in the agency he works for, let alone the needed, vastly more powerful, military.This is a great movie in the mode of Blackhawk Down, just more messed up if you can believe. Best line of the entire ride, 'OK We're officially lost neither Google or Siri know where the F you are'. This puts the cluster in perspective as in boots on the ground whose own intelligence is reduced to common AI phone apps. And this debacle at Benghazi is like a giant compressed big-ass cluster. I think no matter how accurate the movie is it speaks volumes about how the most sophisticated nation with , supposedly, all the right ambitions can get caught totally off-guard. Made to look totally inept. And worse, oblivious of putting it's people open for slaughter. This is occurring as the stock holders for such as Lockheed are racking up dividends yet there's not a one of the glorious war-birds to so much as strike fear in the enemies hearts.. Get it? There is a giant disconnect in our ambitions and actions. It has a huge cost and at the top the cost is human livesThis movie is a must see.. Michael Bay truly delivers an important blue chip film. If one gets nothing other than a most uneasy seat of the pants wetting ride, then you're a block head as there is so much more. This is entertainment with a message. How you use it is up to you, but unless you're made of stone you will be incensed along with being glued to the story. It's not worth saying so and so was great in their role, because the only thing that matters is if the viewers wake up and demand better. How many films can you say that about?",9,7,18,28 May 2016
Sully," This Time An American Hero That's Hard To Fault
","Once more Clint Eastwood turns his lens on a unique American whose actions put him in a category of one. Like American Sniper's protagonist Chris Kyle, Sully's Chesley Sullenberger has steely nerves that enable him to make accurate decisions. This time the accolades won't be tied to controversy...or will they? In the early going we see the aftermath that ensued for Sullenberger as Eastwood chooses to segue ahead of the 'miracle' forced landing. Tom Hanks, as Captain Sullenberger, ably portrays a man who believes in himself even as he is suffering from the trauma of an unbelievably risky nigh perfect water landing. The fact that he saved all 155 souls aboard may be the only thing that really matters to a man like Sullenberger, but he's a family man with a career to also protect. Still, Sully knows that even as he saved lives his own professional one will shortly be on the line. Honestly I did not realize how there were forces playing that would have liked to vilify such a, seemingly great, life saving captain. I get it now, as Eastwood has woven this other darker plot immediately into the otherwise upbeat story. By introducing this the way Eastwood has I realize that this is just as big as the actual landing. It's pretty clear that many factions stand to gain something by hanging fault on Sullenberger. Really? What's wrong with people. Here were have a horrendous disaster averted and someone is worrying about if the plane could have been saved along with the passengers? I guess that's life in the litigation lane?After this excellent setup the movie segues back to the the flight itself. For many of us this is what we've wanted to experience and it's pretty good even if the sheer terror of the passengers is not as palpable as I expected. The focus on the cockpit management is intense and revealing. You'll see shortly why Sully's decision was the only possible way an actual 'human' could have managed the situation for a favorable outcome. The writers and Eastwood did an exceptional job here of recreating the hearing where things could have easily went against a lesser man than Chesley Sullenberger. If not for him it's likely all on board would have perished and if not for his sheer determination to prove the experts wrong he would have been hung out to dry living a shameful existence. You'll see why 38-secons a computer can't understand, but a human actually must have (this is the minimum the board allowed and its actually shy of the real decision time of almost 1 and a half minutes) 's the hinge on which everything turns. This is a brilliantly revealed error in the flight simulation of the plane: multiple failures only a seasoned pilot can manage to which the computerized simulator can't accurately process.I think this is a great look at the only successful (i.e. everyone on board lived) forced water landing of a wide body passenger jet. I think this kind of stuff is not easy to blend the humanity and the cold analytics together into a homogeneous whole. Clint Eastwood has managed this and it's possible he'll get a nod for the best director Academy Award even as these kind of stories seldom do. Tom Hanks, well, he's his usual amazing chameleon self. He eschews all Hollywood bombast and any kind of over-acting. He plays it close and tight to a man who is a very serious type with the skills to match. He is, for an hour and a half, Chesley Sullenberger, not Tom Hanks. That's a high compliment and it's easy to miss as he inhabits the character without interjecting any Hank-isms. He probably won't get the nomination for best actor simply because he is so controlled, like an exceptionally intuitive and disciplined man...like Captian Chesley Sullenberger.See the film and then see it again to soak in more of the gravity of what actually happened. It was called 'The Miracle On The Hudson' to which this movie makes it clear that wasn't any news writer;s hyperbole. Just an amazing man who under the worst circumstance made the best outcome happen. I think this movie this point made well, plus it's truly uplifting.",8,1,2,15 September 2016
Valkyrie," Powerful Accurate Morality Lesson
","Evil will exist in the world we live in. It is our plight since the fall in the Garden Of Eden. When men allow darkness to gain ground it will do so. If good men stand by too long and do nothing evil will be even more sinister and difficult to contain. This is the story of a few men who could no longer watch a madman create a Hell on earth. They risked everything because they knew, in defeat, the wrongs were far too evil to excusePerhaps they were not even truly 'good' men, but they were aware that unchecked criminal actions beget even greater darkness. Thus, these men found it in themselves to risk everything to attempt an end to the greatest personification of evil in modern time. For all their flaws they had in their core a sense of right. They paid the ultimate price...Yet, they did act...And, in their failed coup they did not stand by idol. I would like to think that, like the thief on the cross, they too found redemption and forgiveness.At this late date it's a minor miracle that this story has been given the mainstream big-screen treatment. I applaud those responsible and give Tom Cruise a big 'thumbs-up' for his performance in making this story breathe. Everyone should see this movie because we can all learn from history. Evil can only exist when good men stand by and do nothing.",10,16,28,30 December 2008
Draft Day," The Human Element That Is Draft Day
","Give Kevin Costner a good human-interest role and he can bring his unique star power making it both entertaining and compelling. As an adult I've grown less enamored with pro football and in fairness I'm from Alabama where college football is all it can be and pro isn't a factor. That said, it's the corporate money machine mentality that, in my humble opinion, soils the things I fondly remember of the ancient NFC/AFC of the sixties (where loyalty trumped money often for an entire career). Well, this movie makes that big-business drama work as something much more human. Where the general managers struggle like desperate children for some kind of immediate better future. When even in the last hours those gilded picks are subject to human-error and wild scrambling per last minute decisions and deals. The kind of deals that come not just from statistics, but deeper beliefs. I'd say Draft Day brings this kind of tense drama to the screen with aplomb Is it a true representation? I'd say it doesn't matter because this is a movie and it's a good one.",7,20,23,4 September 2014
The Martian," The Inner Will To Survive...Multiplied.
","An famous (or infamous for it's amazing distillation of emotion) exclamation crept into my mind while taking in Ridley Scott's 'The Martian': 'oh, the humanity'. Humanity, this is what makes this movie rise above the Sci-Fi norm.. One thing is certain and that is man's humanity is his biggest asset and most vulnerable Achilles heel. Mix in ample helpings of hubris which often sets in motion a chain of events forcing a fierce reckoning - 'The Martian' is not a bad reflection of mankind's quest for meaning and progress in the untamed world around us.For the casual viewer this movie fits within a person's reasonable perspective of something that could be real in the not too distant future. The 'real' science, isn't too much of the story told here - it fades into a non-issue for the most part. So, we get a real compelling struggle with maybe not the absolute reality of movie such as Everest, but certainly enthralling.The story moves linearly with just a few flashbacks that aid one to invest in the characters, especially Matt Damon. His character is one you immediately feel an attachment for, plus his character supported by a stellar bit of well written characters.. This is a better than just good story with a nicely realized cast of characters. A wonderful humanistic long-shot survival story its brought to life engaging the viewer rapturously. Speaking of Matt Damon, he really is perfect here. It would be hard to imagine anyone, even a young Tom Hanks, being the combination of likable and all-importantly: believable. The viewer immediately is cast in with astronaut Mark Watney's dilemma. Entertaining, but with profound dialogue such as 'everywhere I go I am the first person who has ever been here' really bring home the journey of man we are still striving for. In fact, even more than the amazing visuals of a striking Mars a second viewing is likely needed to absorb all the quirks of mankind hidden in plain sight in the dialogue itself. Truly both topical and deep thoughts just as we all experience in this thing called lifeexpertly done as entertainment.The Martian is not unlike a re-imagining of the Apollo 13 story. It has that unique intersection of the unthinkable, humanity's will to survive, science, and something spiritually up-lifting. It works as entertainment as well as something deeper we all have in our soul. Bravo! Highly recommended.",9,6,11,11 October 2015
