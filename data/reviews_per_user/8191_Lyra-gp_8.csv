The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," If you are not a twilight fan you are definitely not gonna like it
","To rate this movie I think I should split my opinion in two: The twilighter side and the neutral side. Read the part that better mirrors your attitude.NEUTRAL: The movie has no cinematographic value at all. Just a lame, slow, in places disgusting report of how a vampire-human marriage could be in the first part, and a badly directed (with some very awkward moments) plot development in the second part. I could not help noticing the derisiveness of some scenes; e.g. the one in which the transformed Jacob addresses his other fellows (I thought the movie was turning into a joke at that very moment!) and the one in which Bella makes the bloodshake fall to the ground and kind of breaks her back. A praise goes to the actors: the acting is not bad, is not bad at all considering that, in my opinion, nothing better could have been done (Kristen Stewart's performance is not bad and I found very convincing the character of Jacob). Another criticize goes to the movie slowness; in fact, those who are not very fond of Ed and Bell's love story might probably find the fully detailed and slow part in which the two get married really annoying. Finally, I would rate this movie, in this case, with 4,5 out of 10.TWILIGHTER: I do think very few fans will be disappointed by this installment. Let's be onest, I was almost crying during the scene of the wedding (and I'm a male!!!) mainly because of my affection for the series (I was platonically in love with the story when the first Twilight movie came out). That's the truth: this movie's been made just for those who have always followed and liked the Twilight saga. I don't expect anyone to suddenly turn up and say: I've never given a *** about this series but I've found the movie absolutely awesome! This movie is for us Twilighters all around the world. Because all those scenes have an emotional meaning only in case you are very fond of the series. In this case I can and want turn many blind eyes (may I say it? haha) in the name of my affection for the saga. I enjoyed the Ed and Bell's wedding night, all those particulars (they even play chess!) that made me feel good during the projection of this movie. In this case I would rate the movie with 9 out of 10.That's all, according to my opinion. Thanks for reading.",Null,235,367,20 November 2011
The Adventures of Tintin," Riding and Remembering the shivers of an adventurous childhood
","When about a year ago, at the supermarket, I saw on the Empire magazine's cover the 3D reproduction of one of my childhood's toon-idols my eyes popped out. 'WHO is directing WHAT???' - the question that echoed in my mind: It was a bit of shock finding out that one of my favorite directors was working on a movie from a character I considered buried under the dusts of time. The astonishment was soon replaced by excitement and I made the way back home from the supermarket hopping and smiling. Today I decided to take an adventurous break from my dull academic life and went to the cinema to watch it. No wonder the room was almost full, despite the fact that the movie will be officially released tomorrow. As soon as the opening credits appeared on the screen I felt a shiver of excitement running through my spine as I was visually meeting an old friend from my childhood again; to my pleasure I felt the same sensations I would feel when I was a child. That's one of the VERY good points of this production: the spirit of Herge's Tintin, in Spielberg's movie, remains UNALTERED. There are some cases, though, in which the characters are even better and more deeply characterized than in the comic strips. OK, let's release now all the excitement about this movie. If I had just five short seconds to say how I think this movie is I'd chose 7 words: Mesmerising from the beginning to the end. That's quite true if you consider that even the opening credits are little shining pearls of direction and creativity. The general impression you get from this movie, talking about direction, is that nothing could have been better. Spielberg's direction is, in this case as well, a real warranty of general great quality. Three things I particularly appreciated: -The movie flows perfectly; it is kind of a pleasure for your eyes and for your brain to follow the adventure. -There's literally a STORM of brain-waves (and here comes the Spielberg's touch); especially, in the connection phases between one scene and the other the director totally expresses his genius, turning the open ocean into a pond, making two shaking hands become dunes in the desert and so on (you'll understand what I mean when you'll watch the movie) -The 'camera's movements' literally pull you into the movie and you can't help feeling excited or scared according to the situation.You can tell it's a Spielberg's movie even just looking at these things.Although all the things I have listed until now are enough to candidate the movie as the best movie of the year (in my opinion) there's still something I must remember: The quality of animation. I really could not find a proper term to define my astonishment when my eyes approached the beautiful places and landscapes shown in the movie. They look perfect, shining and bursting with emotions, sensations; they almost look like paintings: For instance, there's a sunset in the movie that I will hardly forget. It's the same with the CGI models: you can see the wrinkles on the character's faces, even their sweat. Furthermore, some words about the actors: Bells and Serkis are maybe the sole two living beings who could have given birth to the cinematographic version of the two main characters. The first succeeds in the hard challenge to provide the audience with a convincing and faithful interpretation of the beloved protagonist (he did A GREAT job indeed), the second is a delightful surprise again, with a funny Scottish accent and a very good interpretation. One last word goes to one of the best composer alive: Sir John Williams. There's nothing to do, every piece of music he creates is able to touch the deepest strings of our hearts. With a soundtrack (already bought at the HMV store) that ranges from the epic tones to the mysterious ones he gives us another example of his limitless genius, because he still remains one of those composers able to make us cry.Finally, Tintin - The Secret of the Unicorn, is one of the greatest surprises of the year. Another great adventure in the archive of the most spectacular stories of humanity, told by a MASTER story-teller (Spielberg). A movie you will hardly forget.",10,159,231,25 October 2011
Scott Pilgrim vs. the World," The boy who had the b*lls to challenge the world
","I wonder if you remember the short by Pixar named 'When day meets night'. There was a voice at the radio which said 'People are afraid of changements, people fear everything that is not usual'. I think this sentence perfectly fits the situation. Why hasn't Scott Pilgrim been a success at the box office? The answer's very simple: Because it's too different. What about a 'pee bar' that empties little by little as the protagonist piddles? Mhm...too ingenious for we poor people that think Avatar is the maximum the world of cinema can give us.I do not care what many people could think (and many reviewers, I outta add), Scott Pilgrim deserves (or maybe deserved) a great success. Because it is something new, something that anybody had never seen before then I'd award it even just for that. We shoulda go watching this kind of movies, because so doing we would show the Hollywood world that we viewers need something more than the usual Blockbuster.Anyway, I'd give this movie a 10 stars rating. At first for its protagonist, Michael Cera. Oh my God, his performance has stroke me so much that made me think I'd be gay for him (lol). Even all the others characters, so fascinating, original and histerically funny. The character played by Chris Evans, who perfectly fits his role, is in my opinion the best of the seven evil exes. Elizabeth Mary Winstead adds a little drop that doubles the value of the cast.There are a lot of brainwaves (Do you remember in the first teaser trailer 'What are you doing? - I'm getting' a life!') which make this movie pretty precious. Colorful and funny even in its smallest detail, it reminded me of the graphic novel the story comes from, adding some elements we often find in videogames.Finally, I rally in support of this movie because I think it deserved much more than what it is getting at the box office. Come on, go watching this movie or maybe someday the industrial world of cinema will be still thinking that another Avatar is always better than something new and then risky.",10,3,12,18 August 2010
Wreck-It Ralph," Wreck me Ralph, please!
","Since the release of its very first trailer, a long time ago, Wreck it Ralph has always appeared as one of the most promising animated flicks of the year. Having seen the movie, I have changed my mind: It's not just one of the best animated movies, it's one of the best movies (or maybe the best) of the year. I don't like to make Disney/Pixar comparisons, but this time Disney has outdone itself. Compared to Brave (which was good enough), Wreck it Ralph is a very strong movie, based on a complex, fresh and original story involving the video games world. I think this is the first step in the process of creating an animated movie: to find a fresh, involving idea. Every small detail, every character seems to perfectly fit in this magical world behind one of the most diffused hobbies in the world. This is undoubtedly Disney at its best. In Wreck it Ralph there are not boring parts, you can laugh or be scared, be moved or even be thrilled but you will hardly yawn while watching this movie. During the projection, I literally burst out with laughters, as the movies presents many funny situations. It's a real pleasure to follow the story and to enjoy every small detail present in the movie.The characters are very 'toony' but at the same time they seem to be real and very believable. There are no clichés or stereotypes, everything is fruit of the ingenious minds working at Disney. For example, if you asked me 'who's your favorite character?' I couldn't answer because they're all great and funny. Ranging from Ralph to Vannelope, from Felix to King Candy, every character is perfectly portrayed. But Wreck it Ralph is not just a way to laugh and pass a couple of entertaining hours: it's far more than that. Not only the film is full of references to the video game world, but it contains lots of references to movies and modern world themes. It's even full of reflections upon life, in the typical Disney style.The icing on the cake is the ending. I will not spoil anything about it, I will just say that it's astonishing and very unpredictable. To put it in a funny way, I would say that it's one of the best thrillers I've seen this year! Finally, two words for the soundtrack. Henry Jackman ost is catching and enjoyable. In some cases, it's a mix between music and the sounds of old 8bit video games. In particular, I really appreciated the track 'Arcade Life' and 'Arcade Ending'. The end credits song, 'When can I see you again' by Owl city is also truly enjoyable. I think Wreck it Ralph is not just one of the best animated flicks of the year, but it's one of the best movies of 2012. Disney has outdone itself, I'm looking for other animated masterpieces like this one, fresh original and entertaining.",10,15,17,30 December 2012
Kick-Ass," From no powers comes no responsibility...except...that wasn't true
","If you wanna here's a review entered by an unlucky Italian who had to go to England to watch this movie because in Italy it has not been released yet (I think it won't never be) because of the great costs. Well, at first I'd say that in the last years I've always been let down by a lot of movies which seemed quite interesting but which never impressed me. Maybe because of trite plots, maybe because of the lost passion for cinema of the directors whose interests concern just money, because of the dammit sequels and so on... I was praying God for not being let down even by this movie and...He realized my wish. OK, I'm pretty mad I had been travelling for two hours by plane but...it was WORTH! Then if I say so I think you have probably already understood how I thought this movie was. The first thing that leaps to the eyes is characters. I completely fell in love with Kick Ass, Hit Girl and overall Red Mist (I could be gay for him lol). The plot, even if it concerns a super-hero story, it's different from the traditional ones 'cause here everything's real (you may see youtube, played songs that really exist in everyday life, and the REAL kick-ass comic book) and it's not so exaggerate as traditional ones: no superpowers, just the normal strength of (quite) normal people. Special effects are worth of a special mention overall for fighting scenes (I love Hit-Girl 'parkour' and her acrobatic actions). I am just disappointed because of the fact that a lot of fantastic movies are often not published in many countries and that's a great pity. I won't add anything more, I just say if you haven't watched it yet, DO IT!",10,4,9,6 June 2010
Super 8," Super 8, the 'format of my childhood'
","I cannot even remember for how long I have been waiting for this movie before watching it this morning. It was kinda a dream come true, I could hardly believe that I was finally experiencing the film whose trailers had made me shiver more than just once. I was so keen that I could not wait: I went to the cinema for the first show at midday. The perfect mix (A pinch of Elle Fanning, some good chilling thrill, a mysterious creature and our darling J. J. Abrams) for a 20-year-old guy like me. Just to give you an idea of what impact this movie had to me I can tell you readers that, although several hours have passed since the show, I am still thinking of the plot, the characters and the music. Super 8 will unlikely make no impressions on you: You love it or you hate it. It's not just a matter of having sci-fi thrillers among the favorite movie genres because the film is first of all a cinematic experiment: A J J Abrams attempt to introduce the spectacular way to see the life of the 80s Steven Spielberg and a friend-love-family-destruction plot into the new Millennium generation. First things first it cannot be said that the movie is not well-directed: Abrams has a great experience, even when he 'copies' from his cine-mate Spielberg (There are some delicious brainwaves: The way in which he indirectly informs us about the incident in the factory, the way in which he avoids to show the creature when it attacks - You'll understand what I am talking about when you'll watch the movie). So, even just for that I'd rate the movie 8 stars. Secondly, the cast. And when I say 'the cast' I am mostly referring to Elle Fanning: She's stunningly beautiful and she has a face expressiveness I have seldom recognized in a 13- year-old girl. Concerning the other members of the cast I really cannot blame anyone and very surprisingly I really enjoyed the performances of the younger ones. Very well chosen 'faces' make this movie a must-see (And here I MUST praise those who choose the cast: In contrast with a large number of cinematic productions where people choose the actors according to their 'hotness' or 'being cool', NONE of the faces seen in Super 8 seem to be 'dull' and 'banal').Thirdly, the plot. OK, it's not Agatha Christie, it's not Shamalayan (at least at the time of The Sixth Sense) but it's good and gripping. Maybe a little bit predictable, but I would have blamed the writers if they had chosen to make the movie end in a different way. The plot is quite simple; however, it's all I was expecting from a movie like this: I really have no reason to be disappointed because I felt strongly satisfied at the end of the movie. It's moving, it's thrilling, there are even a lot of jumping-off-the-seat moments and, last but not least, SPECTACULAR. Fourthly, the Music. Even though we can identify a main theme that is repeated in different ways and tones during the movie, Michael Giacchino did a very very very good job. It's not an anonymous theme, it's a theme that I still keep humming in my mind and that, in my opinion, is far better than many other themes from movies far more popular than Super 8. Last considerations. Super 8 is a movie I've been waiting for for a very long time. Quite happily I may say, today, that it did not disappoint me, not in a single way. J J Abrams, the cast, the Music Composer did a very good job. It's not perfect for sure but it has everything it needs to be considered a 'cult' and I will probably let it in my 'cinematic'-heart.",10,38,70,5 August 2011
The Woman in Black," Frights that taste like antiquity
","The Woman in Black comes from the past, in any sense. From the best selling book by Susan Hill, written in the 80s, it tells a ghost story that accurately respects the ancient tradition of the genre. The attempt to bring to life this kind of novel, about ancient manors and ghastly appearances, might, at a first glance, seem rather risky and unnecessary. This is definitely true if we think of the nature of the movie that, in fact, does not bring any new innovation to the genre. Fortunately, if we focus on the way the movie is made we may find lots and lots of reasons to watch this movie.First of all, the 19th century atmosphere of the Woman in Black completely swallows you up. Many times, while watching the movie, I totally empathized with the protagonist. I cannot tell whether that's good or bad, as in many cases I was glad I wasn't really in the protagonist shoes. The whole setting (costumed people included) is so well-created that every time manages to make you feel anxious/worried/scared according to the circumstance. This is one of the greatest points of strength of the movie.Secondly, the movie knows how to scare you. I am not claiming that it will give goose-bumps even to the bravest man on the earth, but that it successfully manages to give you a general sense of sickness by an intelligent use of every detail present in the movie. And here we have scary dolls, frightening toys, spooky objects. All of them accurately created, aimed to make you feel uncomfortable and worried. Of course, this may vary according to the type of watcher but I really appreciated the way the fear was orchestrated. The most appealing feature of the movie is, undoubtedly, the presence of Daniel Radcliffe. Daniel's interpretation is highly satisfying and provides us with a great expression of his real talent. Along with all the other remarkably capable actors, he's exactly what we expect from a movie like this.Finally, even if you're not particularly fond of ghost stories, why don't you give it a try?",8,3,6,2 March 2012
Toy Story 3," Sayin' goodbye to my best friends. In the best way possible.
","I wanna all this stuff to be a part of my own life. Reviewing this title is not a simple thing to do: Toy Story 3 is not just 'a movie', it's THE movie. Not just a silly way to spend about two hours of your life like all the other movies but something you won't never forget, something you'll bring with you until being buried. Because are characters like Buzz and Woody who make our lives special. When I'll think of my early life I won't remember stupid things that boys of my own age often do, I won't remember any idiot girlfriend, I won't remember how difficult school could be, but I'll remember the trilogy that made me dream, the trilogy in which I found my real friends.I think it would be idiot talking about this movie homing in on graphic or plot and so on. Because Toy Story has stopped to be just a movie for me eleven years ago. Then it's like if I'm talking about a friend or even something more. Just a few words to express my thoughts: One of the best things I've ever seen in my whole life. Here is the magic of life. Here life can be surprising. The magic which makes adults become children again. Disney Pixar showed us how magic life can be. I'm proud of acting like a child even if I'm already 19. But who cares...I prefer being a 12 years-old-minded boy rather than being an adult if this is the price to pay.It's the perfect moment to release this movie for me because this is my last year of high school and next year I'll go to university. Toy Story 3 is for me the metaphor of abandoning all my childish world, that actually I won't never abandon because my heart won't never be able to say g'bye to what changed my life forever.The movie's perfect in all its aspects, starting from graphics and arriving to screenplay and direction. I think it's not useful to talk about this.FOUR WORDS: The best movie ever.Bye Woody, Bye Buzz. I won't ever forget you. I will love you forever. Thank you .Giacinto, Italy",10,3,6,21 June 2010
