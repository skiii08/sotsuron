Ali," Ali: A Success
","Ali succeeds at what it is trying to do. It shows Ali as a person, not a legend.I've noticed that a lot of people have been mentioning that this film is to slow and/or boring.  I bet you're the same kind of people that don't even understand 2001: A Space Odyssey. I have one recommendation for all of you; be patient and experience a movie: If it is slow, maybe it's supposed to be! Most of you don't even know how to determine what the intentions of a film are.On another note, I am very pleased that this movie doesn't shy away from what it means to be an American (through the Ali's words). It all boils down to freedom. So many people have forgotten the freedoms that they pretend to protect (i.e. the freedom of speech and the right not to support our government's actions). Look to the founding fathers, they knew what it was about.Also, Will Smith gave a fairly good performance... I even forgot that it was him by the end of the movie.",10,0,0,30 December 2001
"O Brother, Where Art Thou?"," Easily the best of 2000.
","The year 2000 seemed like a year when no decent movies were going to be released.  With such a poor selection of movies it would be ridiculous to even suggest that any other film in 2000 is better than this.  O Brother, Where Art Thou? is not only enjoyable on an intellectual level but an emotional level as well.  The only problem that I have with it is the decision to credit Homer in the opening credits. I would have liked to find that out on my own.  There is simply no excuse for not seeing this movie.",10,1,1,12 March 2001
