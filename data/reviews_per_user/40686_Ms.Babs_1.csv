The Blair Witch Project," Very effectively creates realistic ups and downs of playfulness and panic among the characters without obscene imagery.
","Like the flicks of old, this movie respects your intelligence by giving full room for your imagination and empathy for the characters without spoon-feeding you gore. I took my 15 year old son, who was deeply moved by it. Being an old horror movie buff, myself, my response to the movie was more respect than abject horror. Aside from the constant barrage of 'f' words, which we are supposed to believe are part and parcel of every college kid's vocabulary, I think this should be viewed as a new standard for the future 'old horror flick buffs.'",Null,0,0,8 August 1999
