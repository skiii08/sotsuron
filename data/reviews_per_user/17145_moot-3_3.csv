Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Excellent addition to the series
","I thought that the Phantom Menace was an excellent movie, except for one small detail.  Jake Lloyd, aka, Anakin Skywalker, I found him to be very annoying.  McGregor made an excellent Ben Kenobi.  Portman was very good as the queen.  And finally, as with 99% of all George Lucas films the special effects were astounding.",7,0,0,22 May 1999
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," good movie
","I liked attack of the clones, even though, hayden can't act his way out of a paper bag and that George lucas needs to learn how to write dialouge that doesn't sound so corny.  As most people probably know this movie was filmed entirely in digital format, and then was transferred onto regular film. I have had the opportunity to see the film once in each format.  there is just no comparison, the digital film is astoundingly better quality than is the regular film.  If you get a chance to see it in digital format I strongly urge you to do so, you won't regret it.Overall rating:	7.5 out of 10",8,0,0,3 June 2002
Braveheart," One of the best movies ever made.
","To put it quite simply Braveheart has to be one of the best movies ever made.  I walked out of the theater just astounded at the scope of the movie. Then acting was excellent, the story was great, and the battle scenes were perfectly executed.  There may have been some liberties taken with history, but the movie in totallity outweighs those items.",10,1,2,13 October 1999
