The King's Speech," Well, now we know where all the Oscars are going. Or should...
","I could write for hours about this film. I only just heard about it last night at a New Year's Eve party. Saw it today. To use the vernacular, OMG. Director Tom Hooper has a masterpiece on his hands. Geoffrey Rush, Helena Bonham Carter, Derek Jacobi, and Timothy Spall as Winston Churchill, all turn in excellent performances. Not to forget Guy Pearce as King Edward who abdicated his throne for an American divorc√©e. David Seidler's script is brilliant. The story is laid out cleverly. The pace and rhythm are PERFECT.I think this is one of the best films ever made. It will tear at your guts. And that is where Collin Firth comes in. Mr. Firth gives one of the most poignant and affective performances ever by a male movie star. Where, inside himself, an actor goes for a performance like this, is beyond my comprehension. In the movie, 'A Single Man', Colin Firth served notice that he was an actor of depth and subtlety, the surface of which he had only just begun to scratch. Now, he's more than scratched that surface. He's gouged a chasm through it. He plays the tormented, soon to be King of England, George VI, and does so in a way that very early in the movie buries his hooks in you and doesn't let go. I can not ever recall, while watching a film, having to choke back tears for over an hour and a half. The suffering portrayed by Firth as George VI is subtle at times. In your face at others. But painfully present always. When Firth bellows, 'I am a King' I nearly lost it in a very quiet, and stunned, theater. If you've already seen this film you know what this refers to. As an American I find the concept of a monarchy bewildering. Why is one person more privileged than another just because of the womb he or she sprang from? That being said, I do find the stories of those trapped in this anachronistic time warp fascinating at times. This would be one of those times. This film is the intersection of great personal pain, international upheaval, and a family that is ceremoniously dysfunctional to it's core. Above this chaos, confusion, and unrest, rises a weak shell of a man to greatness. Colin Firth is the vessel for that transformation and if he doesn't win an Oscar for this performance it will tarnish the Academy forever in my humble opinion. This is the kind of performance, and film overall, that you leave thinking to yourself that you've just seen the greatest movie ever. Maybe later you'll see another brilliant film and think that 'this one' is the best ever, but for now 'The King's Speech' has no equal.",10,228,298,2 January 2011
Training Day," Denzel Washington got an Oscar for this? Not so much...
","This movie is about the worst first day at work ever. Must have been a bad year for Best Actor for DW to get Best Actor by giving a 'Jack Nicholsonesque' over the top performance as a crooked narco cop who trains his new partner, Ethan Hawke, on his first day on the job. Ethan Hawke is a serious cop (and he plays the role well). Even so, his trainer, Denzel Washinton, manages to get him to, or I should say the 'script' manages to get him to, on their first day together as partners, smoke PCP, take responsibility for a murder, release two rapists, shake down a drug dealer in a wheelchair, drink beer and hard liquor on the job, conduct an illegal search, and more. It defies believability. The core of the movie seems to be a vehicle for DW to be the big angry, over the top bossy, black guy, and call his new rookie 'nigger' for the first fifteen minutes of the movie. There was no suspense, no tension, just an angry black man yelling at his new white rookie for two hours. Nothing here for me. Why this rates as anything Oscar worthy for anyone is a mystery, more of a mystery than anything in this film... If you have two hours of your life you don't know what to do with don't waste them here. Take Defensive Driving or something...",3,12,22,1 April 2010
The Birth of a Nation," It's beside the point
","I've read a few of the 10's at this site and am a little surprised at the pass given to this monument to slavery, racist bigotry, and violence. 'Birth of a Nation' is a national cinematic embarrassment. That it is well crafted is moot. If this were a movie that glorified rape or child sexual abuse, but was well crafted, well directed, and had outstanding performances in it, would we be discussing it's virtues as a fine piece of film making? I don't think so. Consider this: Nazi Germany committed mass murder against Jews, Gypsies, homosexuals, Slavs, and political enemies. The plunder and suffering inflicted against these people ripples through our culture to this day. The fact that Leni Riefenstahl's cinematography in 'Triumph of the Will' was 'groundbreaking' is kind of beside the point!!! I find the intellectual airy fairy commentary in the 10's section of the reviews here to be disturbing. Frankly, I think you people should be ashamed of yourselves for promoting this disgraceful homage to slavery and murder. Slavery is at the very least murder of the soul. But we all know that was the least of it's offenses. 'The Birth of a Nation' is a bad film because it promotes a reprehensible ideology. The merits of it's production values are irrelevant. And not that it should make a difference but for the record, I am a white male southerner.",1,140,275,6 September 2009
Brokeback Mountain," June 26th, 2013, DOMA and Prop 8 - Struck Down
","There are 2225 reviews of this film here at IMDb. On this momentous day when a good measure of marriage equality has been recognized by the Supreme Court of the United States I would like to add the 2226th. When I first saw this movie I was with my partner of 13 years and it was December of 2005. For the next two days I was in a state of sensory overload. And no matter where I was or what I was doing, this film, it's characters, and the story, ran unbridled through my head. We went back to see it again two days later. And then again the next day. And finally, a total of somewhere around fifteen times. I'm not sure because I lost count around ten. We held hands as we watched this film pour over us like a waterfall from this giant screen and for the first time understood, in a way we couldn't have ever understood before, the power of 'the big screen'. For the first time we understood what other couples experienced as they would watch films like 'The Shop Around the Corner', 'Romeo and Juliet', or 'Shakespear in Love', in the giant format. It was overwhelming. For the first time in our lives we weren't watching from the outside. The raw emotion, love, hurt, happiness, and sadness was in 'our language'. And so over and over again, we sat in a dark theater, holding hands, and watched our lives for the first time, role by on a giant screen. We could have gone fifteen more times.Our story, on paper, didn't resemble the one in Brokeback Mountain. We were actually very happy and loved and accepted by our friends and families. The tragedy of this story, though, was that Ennis could not bring himself to live the life he was meant to live and enjoy the richness of what could have been. He let the world decide his happiness. Or, unhappiness as it were. I found that heart breaking; and felt maybe just a touch of survivors guilt along with the sadness. A month later, coming home from visiting our families for Christmas, after these numerous viewings of this film, I was thinking about the part of the story that dealt with the regret for what might have been. The part about how this man diminished the importance of his happiness to the point of no longer believing he needed it or was entitled to it. Either way the result was the same: living in a prison without bars. I then took a moment to reflect on our lives together and asked myself if there was any way in which I/we might be doing the same thing to ourselves; and I remembered that about ten years earlier we had talked about getting 'married'. It would have only been a private ceremony for family and friends with no legal standing but it would have been an important public declaration of who we were. Ultimately we didn't go through with it. And the reason we didn't go through with it shocked me as I realized it, in that car, driving home, that Christmas. We had diminished it mentally and emotionally to the point that we no longer believed we needed or even deserved it. Mostly because we couldn't have it, for real. But in fact now, in 2005, we could get legally married in Massachusetts. Thinking about that film, thinking about how those characters had deprived themselves of a happiness they could have had, I proposed to my partner. I told him that I thought we had bought into the lie that we didn't deserve this, or it wasn't important, or that it didn't matter, because that's what most people believed. I told him how much I loved him and how I didn't want to wake up 13 more years from now even more disconnected from what our true happiness could be. Should be. We married in Boston a month later in January of '06. We flew there from Texas and faked a residence by using a friends home address, opening a bank account, and putting our friend's utilities in our names. Even though it felt a little like a cold war spy mission, the ceremony was very moving for us and our one witness. So, this film changed our lives in an unexpected way. I will never forget sitting in that theater, holding hands with my now husband, and seeing that film tower over us like a skyscraper from that giant screen. It is still overpowering thinking about it today, June 26, 2013, as we are now recognized as legally married in the eyes of the U.S. Federal Government. Is Brokeback Mountain also a great film? Absolutely. Is this a very good film review? No. But there are 2225 film reviews here to argue the merits of what I believe to be a terrific film. At this moment in time it is my intention to take the opportunity to say what a life changing film this is. My husband and I just celebrated 22 years together on our last anniversary. Today we celebrate equal justice under the law. But it was this film, back in 2005, that revealed to us the invisible bars we had wrongly accepted and placed around our own lives, and opened up the opportunity for us to rectify the injustice we had done to ourselves. And today, the U.S. Supreme Court has delivered us a long overdue measure of justice and removed it's bars from around our lives. This is a great film. And it was a life changer for us. And today, June 26, 2013, I just wanted to mark this historical moment.",10,7,8,27 June 2013
500 Days of Summer," Come here/Go away
","When the moon is in the seventh house and Jupiter aligns with Mars -- you get '500 Days of Summer'. This is one of those rare films where everything lined up perfectly and the results are stunning. Where do you start with a movie this good? Anywhere! Memories: They come to us out of order. We remember endings, and then we remember beginnings. We remember last month, then last year, then yesterday. Sometimes we revel in our memories. Sometimes they kick us in the stomach. And that is how this story is told to brilliant effect. Out of chronological order. And, from the front car of a speeding roller coaster. This is a SWEET film!!! And it could not have been cast better than with Zooey Deschanel and Joseph Gordon Levitt. Deschanel plays Summer Finn. She's alluring and desirable while maintaining a flat, detached affect that only makes her more desirable to all who come in contact with her. Words float from her mouth when she speaks as if to denote a subtle indifference. Holding her hand could cause yours to feel empty. Like holding the hand of a ghost. It's her way to be there, and not be there. She likes it that way. It's safe. Deschanel is brilliant at this and totally believable as Levitt's, unattainable, object of desire. Levitt is wonderfully lost in love for this 'perfect' girl. He is confused, bedazzled, and depressed - he's in love. He navigates all of the roller coaster stages of his characters head on collision with love with deftness and poignancy. I can not imagine any two other actors doing this movie greater justice. There are so many good moments in this movie it might be inappropriate to single out just one over the plethora of others. But I will anyway. It is a beautifully subtle scene with Summer and Tom sitting in a theater watching the final scene of the movie 'The Graduate' with Dustin Hoffman and Katherine Ross. Hoffman and Ross have escaped the chaotic world around them. It's just the two of them now, holding hands, moving ahead into the sunset. Seeing this, Summer (Deschanel), becomes emotional, surprising both herself and Tom. What happens in those few moments is at the heart of this film. And it's importance could almost go by unnoticed because it's done so delicately. As this moment is unfolding we already know everything about Tom. He has no secrets. From the start of this film his chest cavity is wide open with his beating heart on full display. Summer, on the other hand, is all secrets. But when the clock strikes this moment, we learn one of them. It's sweet. It's sad. It's revealing. And, I thought, very powerful because it changes everything we think we know about her up to this point. It also sets up perfectly the beautiful, but perhaps not 'happy', ending that is soon to come.In the opening credits, the narrator explains that this is a 'boy meets girl' story, but that it's not a 'love story'. Well, I don't know about that. I think this is a love story. And a good one. The script is genius. The direction is sharp but never heavy handed. The music plays through the action in perfect accompaniment with the story. There is nothing not to like about this gem. Everyone in the world has lived through this relationship at some point in their life. It's the one that makes you stronger, as it almost kills you. Yes, that one. Here's what it looks like as a movie. A good movie.",10,11,20,29 July 2010
Crash," Everyone who is good is bad and everyone who is bad is good...
","This got an Oscar for Best Picture? Seriously? Spoiler alert: Watching this film will spoil two hours of your life. Reading this will only spoil two minutes. Crash 101: Bullock (wealthy LA socialite) screams at her husband (they've just been carjacked) that the Hispanic locksmith is going to give their new keys to his gang banger friends. Then she screams at her Hispanic maid for not putting away the dishes. Then she sprains her ankle and none of her rich bitch friends come to help her but the Hispanic maid does. She puts her arms around the maid and says, 'you're my BEST friend'. Then, black carjackers (one nice, one bad) hit a poor/innocent/hardworking 'chinaman' with Bullock's stolen car as he's getting into his van. Chinaman's wife finds him in the hospital and he tells her to 'cash this check immediately'. It's a paycheck for the slaves still chained in the back of his van - because, you know, slave trafficers are paid by personal checks. Matt Dillon is racist cop who pulls over rich black couple, Terence Howard and Thandie Newton. Dillon makes them get out of expensive car, spread 'em, cop gropes wife, husband can't do anything about it. White racist cop forces black husband to make humiliating apology in exchange for 'freedom'. At home, drunk black wife screams at black husband for being a coward. While all this is going on racist cop's white partner, Ryan Phillippe, does nothing. Then asks his black commander for a transfer away from racist cop. Black commander won't grant transfer because he doesn't want to be seen as attacking lower ranking white racist cop. Later, non-racist Phillippe picks up a lone black hitchhiking teenager (the 'nice' car jacker from above), in the middle of the night because - so many people, cops or otherwise, do that... They get into an argument for no reason. 'Good' hitchhiker/carjacker reaches into his pocket for St. Christopher statue because lots of black/teen/thugs carry those with them. Non-racist cop thinks he's going for a gun and shoots thug dead. Non-racist cop dumps good/black/carjacker's body on the side of the road. Persian store owner and daughter buy a gun. White gun shop owner says they're responsible for 911. Persian store owner has Hispanic locksmith (same from Bullock's house) fix lock on his store. Store gets burglarized anyway. Asian insurance adjuster won't cover burglary because door/lock weren't good. Persian guy gets his new gun, hunts down Hispanic locksmith to kill him (btw, Hispanic locksmith speaks perfect English and is best daddy/husband in the world to 5 year old daughter and wife), finds him and confronts him with gun in front of his home. Locksmiths's daughter runs out and jumps into Hispanic daddy's arms to protect him as gun goes off. Hispanic daddy/locksmith screams over shot daughter (long story about magic bullet proof cape she's wearing). Persian killer (not responsible for 911) looks on in horror. But 5 year old isn't shot. Bad/white/gun store owner had sold him blanks to go with gun purchase because, you know, 911. Don Cheadle is an LA detective with a crack addicted mother and a missing brother, and a 'white' girlfriend. His crack mother only cares about her missing son even though Cheadle brings her groceries but she's too cracked out to notice. Brother turns out to be black/teen/thug/carjacking/hitchhiker who's body is found on the side of the road shot by non-racist cop Phillippe. Cheadle and his crack mother identify brother/son's body. She blames Cheadle for brother's death because he 'didn't find him and bring him home'. Cheadle is sad because crack mother thinks groceries came from thug/carjacking/hitchhiking/missing son and not him...Racist cop Matt Dillon is actually a 'good' guy because he cares for ailing father who can't pee. He also saves black/angry/drunk/rich/wife (from earlier 'spread 'em' traffic stop) by pulling her from fiery crash. Rich/black/'spread 'em'/husband later ends up being car jacked by 'bad carjacker' from earlier Bullock carjacking. They get into high speed argument, 'I'm taking your car - no you're not', and end up being pulled over. Rich/black/spread 'em'/speeding/husband decides this is a good time NOT to cooperate with cops. Standoff ensues. Non-racist white cop, Phillippe, happens to be there, intervenes, everyone backs off. Bad carjacker has been hiding in 'semi-carjacked car' through all of this. Rich/black/husband lets bad/carjacking/thug go but tells him, black to black, he's ashamed of him. Harsh man.I'm not even going to go into the black TV director/of a black sitcom/Tony Danza storyline... So bad/black/teen/carjacking/thug goes back to bad/hit and run/Chinaman's van and releases slaves. Good/black/teen/carjacking/thug is dead on the side of the road where his brother, Detective Cheadle, finds him during investigation. Sandra Bullock still loves her Hispanic maid. Dillon, the good/son/racist/molesting/cop is now a hero. Un-shot Hispanic locksmith family lives happily ever-after. Persian store owner goes back to store happy he didn't become a murderer. Detective Cheadle just goes on being under-appreciated by crack mother. And then there's another car crash and you don't even care at this point.This is a mediocre movie with a manipulative screenplay. It makes a pretense to be about interconnectedness but ultimately it's a laundry list of all the racist/racial possibilities in people. And then flips each one on it's head. You don't get to know or care about any of them because it's just a long list of reversals. 'Crash' is as much a 'movie' as this is a 'review'. Gotcha!",1,8,11,18 January 2015
Capote," Help me out. Who are we supposed to care about here?
","I saw this when it came out in '05. I've just re-watched all but the opening which I missed on HBO and could not care less about going back for. I had a sick feeling the first time I saw this and that was confirmed tonight. First, this screenplay demands that we ache for a sad one hit wonder of a writer and his grotesque infatuation for a quadruple murder who, 'In Cold Blood', murdered a father, a mother, their son, and their daughter. For nothing. Their murders, much like the source material, are used only as a means to comprehend the killers. This film is as senseless as the crime it purports to be about.I was a big Hoffman fan: 'Talented Mr. Ripley', 'Happiness', 'Boogie Nights', (not 'The Master') he always delivered. And he does here too. Sort of. But to what effect? We're supposed to have sympathy for his bizarre crush on a caged killer? And the improvisation scene after the book reading was cartoonish. And Dan Futterman? Why? How sick do you have to be to write THIS story from THIS point of view? And where did this phantom boyfriend come from? There is no historical basis for Truman Capote to have a 'boyfriend'. He was a sad lonely man who wrote one book, could never finish another, became famous for being 'odd', and then died a lonely alcoholic.I don't expect to make any friends here with this review. It's fashionable to like this crap. No thanks. The empathy is forced and pointed in all the wrong directions. I would really like for someone to tell me who we are supposed to care about in this story...",1,3,10,22 March 2017
Foxcatcher," How much for your soul?
","This film fires on all pistons. ¬†Skillfully directed with an economically written screenplay it is made real before your eyes by a cast of unparalleled performances.¬†This film is as near perfection as you can get.The screenplay is brilliant beyond words because it is beyond words. ¬†In the case of this film, the economy of words, and the power of silence, speaks volumes. ¬†And that silence, in the hands of a director and a cast like this, roils like volcanic magma. ¬†'Foxcatcher' is the true story of two brothers, Mark and David Schultz, who become entangled in the dysfunctional mother/son relationship of Jean and John du Pont.¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†¬†Steve Carell plays¬†John, a multimillionaire loner who's family's money is so old it smells. ¬†He wisely piled on about a pound of makeup and prosthetics to the point where he is unrecognizable as the lovable goofball from '40 Year Old Virgin'. ¬†He then delivers one of the creepiest and most menacing performances ever recorded on film, and it would never have been as effective if he had been in the clown suit he's been wearing for the last 15 years. ¬†Vanessa Redgrave as Jean, with only about three minutes of screen time, manages to buttress her son's weirdness with her own. ¬†They are each the byproducts of too much money, isolation, and total disconnection from consequences. They dislike one another and they dislike one another's obsessions: hers, expensive horses, his, male Olympic wrestlers. ¬†The estate they share has a world-class stable of Thoroughbreds presided over by Jean, and a world-class training center for wrestling presided over by du Pont. ¬†It is from these two fortresses that they war with one another. ¬†They are each, the only people in their respective lives, who spends any time with them that isn't paid to do so.¬†And it is into to this toxic tar pit that the Schultz brothers are lured. ¬†In 1987, the Schultz brothers are Olympic gold medalists in wrestling. Post Olympic glory, they are living a very modest, if not meager, life training in a run down gym for the Seoul games. ¬†The film opens with the two in a sparring practice with one another. ¬†Their moves have been studied and repeated a thousand times before and, but for a mostly disregarded bloody nose, rudimentary.¬†This is their war, their sibling rivalry, but tamed by rules. ¬†Nonetheless, it is a conflict that reaches beyond the boundaries of their sport. ¬† Out of nowhere this daily grind is interrupted by mulit-millionaire wrestling 'enthusiast' John du Pont. He makes the younger Schultz, Mark, an offer of $25,000.00 to come to his personal training center. The trade off is to acknowledge him as his coach. ¬†Du Pont, outfitted in coaching attire, walks imperiously around the gym, nodding and barking orders at his 'stable' of wrestlers, without a clue to what he is doing. ¬†He knows nothing about wrestling but is well practiced at grooming those around him with money and access to his privilege. ¬†Over time, though, Mark becomes unmanageable and equally uncomfortable with du Pont's demands which are only vaguely alluded to. ¬†Du Pont then purchases the previously unaffordable David Schultz to straighten out Mark. ¬†It is a deal with the devil. ¬†The startling pivot in this film creeps up out of nowhere when David is¬†asked to participate in a documentary and praise du Pont's coaching. ¬†Take after take,¬†with the film director prodding him, he is unable to say into the camera with any discernible sincerity, that he admire's du Pont's coaching ability. ¬†The footage is rendered useless but¬†it is¬†not forgotten. ¬†The tension between du Pont, Dave, and the younger brother Mark, who has Olympic weight on his shoulders, becomes unsustainable as the egos, dysfunction, and expectations, begin devouring the possibilities. ¬†The results will leave no winners on or off the wrestling mat. ¬†Art Director, Brad Ricker, has washed the imagery of this film in grey; the color of decay, dust, and inertia. ¬†The pace of the film is deliberately - not fast. The silence, so skillfully directed and acted, is deafening. ¬†Carell, Ruffalo, Redgrave, and Channing give Oscar worthy performances.The mixture of money, glory, dysfunction, ego, and the Olympic ideal, all come together here to create a compelling and disturbing picture of real life events. The snowball affect of one decision, leading to another, and another, until - well, bang, is unfurled with foreboding and deliberateness. This is a film that you can feel. It's not a good feeling, and you feel as though you are there. Not being nominated for Best Picture is unbelievable. But Oscar really only reflects achievement at about a rate of 50/50. This film will suffer the curse of being a great film about a bad thing. But it is a great film and well worth seeing. They'll get my ticket money twice.",10,11,16,10 February 2015
The Game," This could have been a DISASTER!!!
","The plot (not the writing) of this film is ridiculous. But it works! Director David Fincher did a masterful job of taking a well written, but very far fetched, story and knitted it together with great performances by Michael Douglas (spectacular), Deborah Kara Unger, Sean Penn, and brilliant atmospherics that make this a stomach twister from beginning to end, and end, and end, (there are three). When viewing a film like this you have to ask or answer only one question. Does it suspend your disbelief long enough for you to go along with what you're seeing and have the required emotional response for the story to move forward? The answer here is, YES. If not for Michael Douglas and Deborah Kara Unger this could not have worked. Douglas, as Nicholas Van Orten, brings the audience along with him on a terrifying journey, The Game, from his perch high above the financial world to his complete ruin, destitution, and eventual suicide. It is a wild and scary ride and at least once I jumped right out of my seat. Deborah Kara Unger, as Kristine, had an equally challenging job and I loved how she did it. She is the chameleon in the story. She deftly blends into whatever phase the story is at and you're never quite sure if she's a killer, a thief, the mastermind, or your best friend. How she does this is amazing to watch. A simple turn of her head can send a chill up your spine and you suddenly know (or think you know) she's not who you thought she was. When Van Orten confronts her with her fake first communion picture she's toast. Or so you think. Without missing a beat she walks right up to him and whispers, 'they're watching'. It's chilling. I love performances that are quiet and mysterious and hers is as good as they come. The original music by Howard Shore is brilliant. The score, as far as I can tell, uses only a few strings, piano, and a very haunting French Horn. So simple, but so effective. Other popular songs dot the movie and that's where my only complaint of this film comes in. I love the song 'White Rabbit' by Jefferson Airplane. And it's used to great affect in this film to scare the crap out of you. And so from now on when I hear it I'll think about getting the crap scared out of me. Thanks. This really could have been a disaster. It's very well written but without Fincher's direction and a brilliant cast all bringing their 'A' game it would never have worked. The holes in the plot, well itemized here at this site, are many. But it is still suspenseful and frightening and believable long enough for you to be taken in completely. The 'ending' is baseball bat to the head. It works so well though I didn't hate myself at all for falling for it. Twice.",8,8,12,30 January 2011
Call Me by Your Name," Elio, Elio, Elio...
","This is a visually stunning film. Dramatically, it pulls its punches until long after you've expected, and wanted, them. And stubbornly, it never goes where you want it to go. And that is the point. Even so, by its conclusion you will feel that you've been on a profound journey drenched with strong, and confusing, emotions. Armie Hammer plays Oliver, an American college student on a foreign study assignment to Italy. There, he is a house guest of a family in a country villa with a 17 year old son played by Timothee' Chalamet. It is the early 1980's: the purgatory years for gay people when 'Dynasty's' Stephen Carrington whiplashed between gay and straight from one episode to the next on American television, the AIDS epidemic was in, what turned out to be, its infancy, laws criminalizing gay people remained in penal codes around the world, and marriage equality had not yet been imagined; much less litigated, even much more less become a reality. Within this geo-social landscape, questions began to echo through these societal, and homophobic, norms. 'Norms' that turned out, in fact, to be abnormal. They turned out to be merely dominant; and poorly examined. It is within this societal context that Elio and Oliver meet. The pace, and arc, of their relationship is deliberately, well - not fast. On the way, however, we are treated to the breathtaking beauty of the Italian countryside, squabbling, and of course passionate, Italians, and the heterosexual distractions that constitute the moat between the two main characters. Armie Hammer throws his acting depth onto the sacrificial fires of this film for the greater good of delivering an Oliver who is as one dimensional as a billboard and as alluring as a mirage. He is tall, handsome, and cocky. He smiles with acres of white teeth and punctuates his conversations with one word quips like, 'later'. The power in his character is literally its lack of obvious depth. It is a thankless job. But so effective in the totality of this story. He is allowed a few brief moments to reveal the roiling conflicts inside of himself. Then just as quickly as they appear, they're withdrawn lest they be examined too thoroughly; which is the point. Elio, by contrast, is a walking human autopsy of the living. His deepest troubles and longings are laid bare. And Chalamet is extraordinary in revealing something about youth that we are incapable of taking our eyes off of. He is a fawn pulling himself up by his wobbly legs for the first time and then bursting into a full gallop fueled by instinct, exuberance, and energy. These are the qualities that have been slowly killed in the adults who surround him. They are the qualities that echo from the past; from the relics that Elio's father dredges up from the ocean floor (foreshadowing here...), to the beautiful countryside's centuries old stone walls adorned with faded, macabre, Mussolini posters. These same qualities will be killed in Oliver, ultimately. But you can't prevent instinct, exuberance, and energy, because it is continuously reborn. As it has been in Elio. The deliberate, and sometimes deliberately frustrating, pace with which this story is told renders its most powerful moments a punch to the gut. Before that sledgehammer (no pun intended) lands, we are re-acquainted with the chaotic messiness of youth where anything is theoretically possible; until it crashes head on into reality. That's the time in life when we learn how not to hurt people by hurting them and then regretting it. By the time the final conversation between Elio and Oliver arrives, over a hissing and crackling long distance phone line, you will need to pick your stomach up from the floor. Elio, in a barely audible whisper, cries out to Oliver. His voice is the only voice that hasn't succumbed yet. He is the sole survivor that, for all practical purposes (bizarre plot line detour notwithstanding), is alone is the wilderness. Oliver cannot hear his pleas over the din of the grinding gears of the pantomime of life around them. Elio's pleas echo back to him alone; and leaves us with the question, him too? You'll get an answer to that. But not in this review. Passing through the lobby after the film I saw a man, seated, head buried in his hands, sobbing uncontrollably. He was being comforted by a female companion; his sister, a friend, or wife, don't know. Truth be told, we all felt at least a little bit like the way he looked. Was he Elio? Or Oliver? Don't know. That scene in the lobby, for me, was the inescapable ending to this film.",10,3,6,28 January 2018
The Boy in the Striped Pajamas," Are you kidding me?
","This movie is proof that we have reached the point of diminishing returns on films about the Holocaust. Many reviewers here have already recounted the ridiculous storyline, the bad acting, etc., so I'll skip over that aspect of this cinematic failure. What struck me more than anything is how implausible the plot was and how unforgivably manipulative the ending is. My only emotions as the credits rolled on this dud were of disbelief that anyone would make such an irresponsible movie about such a serious subject matter. And so it brings me to the conclusion that we may just have said all there is to say about the Holocaust. When movies like this begin to appear, it's subject, the Holocaust, has become a tool. A tool for money making, emotional exploitation, or commercialization. It is a disservice to history, and to the murdered millions, to use the Holocaust in such a shallow capricious manner. Don't see this film.",1,84,173,28 November 2010
The Dark Knight," all you need to know is......
","I saw this movie on a Monday afternoon in hopes of avoiding a long wait and big crowds at the theater. Good plan. It worked. The movie didn't. Many reviewers have already commented on the gross mediocrity of this film so I'll skip that part. There were some very good, though isolated, moments in the story: a lesson about how torture is wrong and doesn't work, the equal value of all lives regardless of how they have been lived, 'abridged' civil rights are neither civil nor right, etc. I like all those concepts and they are certainly worthy of exploration given our current political state.To me, however, the most prominent feature of this film was neither Heath Ledger, (whom I greatly respect as an actor), Christian Bale, nor the script, directing, story line, performances, or suspense, but rather the gorrific violence that punctuated almost every moment of the more than two and a half hours this thing went on. Everything in this movie explodes!!! And the cut aways in the editing do nothing to mitigate the impact of all the slashing, stabbing, pounding, bludgeoning, shooting, and impaling that becomes ridiculous about halfway through. And though I have enormous respect for him, Ledger's Joker was basically Ted Bundy with face paint. I think the inspiration for this film came more from Oliver Stone's 'Natuarl Born Killers' than from anything that was ever written in a comic book.All you need to know is this... In the last ten minutes of the film, with the body count hovering somewhere around 100, a scene begins to unfold where a young child is about to be murdered in cold blood, (those of you who have seen the movie know what I'm talking about). The scene goes on for what I thought was an excruciatingly long time, but even as it was just beginning I was thinking to myself, 'no, no, no, this is wrong. This should not be done this way in a movie'. Then somewhere in the theater, behind me, a child began sobbing uncontrollably. Yes, real terror, real horror, real fear, a real child, right there in the theater. The scene finally came to an end. The sobbing didn't. As the lights came up for us to leave I saw a couple escorting their approximately 12 year old son out of the theater, still sobbing, and hanging on to his parents' clothing as they walked out.I don't blame the parents. This movie's PG13 rating is unconscionable. This is a 'Batman' movie! With a PG13 rating! 'Batman' originated from a children's comic book series. One would think that this movie would be a safe experience for children. It's not. Given the grotesque thread of constant violence that runs from the opening credits to the closing credits it's not even suitable for adults. Several of the postings here at IMDb with the lowest ratings have noted that they are putting their rating as low as possible to balance out the overly generous perfect scores that have vaulted this movie into the position of being one of the greatest film ever,according to IMDb. Not me. I really didn't like this movie. And in the last ten minutes of it I came to hate it. It does not do service to the Batman franchise, or movies in general. There is not a shred of 'comic book' appeal in it anywhere, and it will take it's place as one of the most uselessly violent movies ever made. That this offering has the broad appeal it has makes me a little sad, and sick inside. And if I could speak for the poor kid that was sitting behind me during this bloated gore fest I'd say this, 'thanks for the memories'.",1,65,150,29 July 2008
Les Mis√©rables," The good, the bad, and the ugly...
","This is possibly the most flawed great film ever. Fortunately, Victor Hugo's classic novel has survived re-tellings through opera, film, and Broadway musicals since 1862. It survives this film version of the stage musical too. Tom Hooper is to be credited for it's success (the good), it's numerous miscalculations (the bad), and some outrageous blunders (the ugly). The Good (Things that worked): 1)Two words, Eddie Redmayne! Tom Hooper wanted this musical delivered by actors who could sing. Redmayne delivers the biggest punch of the film. He is giddy and fumbling when meeting Cossette for the first time in a manner that is endearing and believable. Singing 'Empty Chairs, Empty Tables' he is tortured and grief stricken. His performance in this film is as complex as you might expect from the same actor who played the matricidal Bakelite heir in 'Savage Grace' opposite Julianne Moore. 2) Ann Hathaway's performance. Oscar worthy, maybe. 3) Tom Hoopers choice to have actors do the singing instead of the other way around. Though it didn't always turn out well, overall, it was a brilliant decision. 4) The indestructible classic novel by Victor Hugo, 'Les Miserable'.The Bad (Things that didn't work, but could have): 1) Hooper let the singers pace the movie. Bad call. Guess what happens when you tell an actor/singer that they have all the time they'd like. They take it!!! Each singer, with the exceptions of Redmayne and Seyfried, overstretched their phrases, repeatedly, until the pace of the film began to resemble the grinding pace of a rush hour traffic jam. 2) Diction!!! The chorus, which is a whole separate character in Les Mis, was disconnected from the orchestra, and each other, during 'When Tomorrow Comes'. The 'free association' approach used by the main characters REALLY doesn't work when you have 50 people singing, 'CCaann yyouuu hearrrrr the ppppeoppplle sssinngg...' It sounded like a barroom full of drunks. 3) The sound engineer should have been fired for burying the orchestral score to the point that you could barely hear them, DURING JAVERT'S SUICIDE!!! Think back to any film with a music score by Bernard Herman or Jerry Goldsmith. You'll hear THAT orchestra. If ever an orchestra needed to be heard it was here. It's a great score. And the music (of this 'musical') needed to soar above the film. Instead, it sounded like it was being smothered with a pillow. 4) Hugh Jackman, whom I really like, did not have the voice for this role. It's very nasal and strained. I get that Hooper made a calculated decision to cast: Hugh Jackman, Russell Crowe, Sacha Baron Cohen, Ann Hathaway, and Helena Bonham Carter for their box office draw and not their voices. That decision will bring in an audience. Doesn't mean, however, that it works for the film. 5) The film editor: for chopping up 'Empty Chairs at Empty Tables' for no apparent reason, and for chopping off the end of several scenes that needed to linger a bit. Yeesh! The Ugly (Things that didn't stand a chance and nearly ruined the film): 1) Sacha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter blew it. Too undisciplined to pull off those roles. Timing was horrible. Cohen flubs 'Colette' so badly that the audience is laughing over the real punchline where he's corrected and is suppose to quickly sing the end of the note with 'Cosette'. Not to mention his out of control ad libs that just look goofy (imagine that with him) and do nothing to move the story forward. They only (and what else is he good at) bring the attention to himself. 2) Russel Crowe: Yikes! Casting him in the role of Javert was the greatest colossal blunder of the entire film. His inability to sing neutered the polarity of right-versus-wrong which the story hinges on. He was so disoriented he couldn't do the one thing he was there for, to act. Now - does this add up to a bad film? No. It only adds up to a bad 'Les Miserable'. People in the audience were balling their eyes out. The story is compelling and it does get told here. The average film goer is not going to be bothered in the least by the glaring flaws of this work. Especially because there are enough glorious moments to even things out. Eddie Redmayne, Ann Hathaway, Samantha Barks, all deliver very strong performances. Samantha Seyfried, I think, is under recognized for her work here. Next to Redmayne, she does the best job of acting/singing. She has a sweet voice and it suits the character perfectly. She and Redmayne are terrific together. I think this is a great, though flawed, film. Imagine the sacrifices Boubil and Schonberg made by reducing Hugo's masterpiece from a 1500 page novel to a three hour stage musical. Were there 'Les Miserable' (the novel) devotees then, they would have been screaming about the bastardization by 'Les Miserble' (the musical). Today, however, our point of reference is no longer the novel, but rather the stage musical. Set it aside, as we did the novel when the musical came along, and this film is good. It works. And that's all it has to do, warts and all.",9,6,10,1 January 2013
The Happening," Question: did M. Night Shyamalan actually sit in a screening room and say to himself, 'Great! Stick my name on this.'
","Warning! Warning! Film turd ahead! Wow, you just can't imagine anything this bad coming from the guy who directed 'The Sixth Sense'. IMDb only allows 1000 words for a review. I'm going to try to keep this under 50. You have to start with the moronic script; and then end there. I haven't heard dialogue this cringe worthy since, well, ever in my life. Betty Buckley as Mrs. Jones... smashing her bloody face through a window, twice... no words. The only thing that kept me watching this giant pant load was the fast forward button and enough curiosity about whether or not it could continue to worsen. It did.",1,0,0,16 July 2017
Jersey Boys," How could Eastwood mess this up?
","I can handle a book to a movie, a play to a movie, a short story to a movie, an opera to a movie, a movie to another movie, name it, I can handle the transition. I can overcome high expectations brought on by great original source material - like Jersey Boys on Broadway to Jersey Boys the film. What I can't handle is phenomenal (Jersey Boys Broadway) to mediocre (Jersey Boys Movie). The first hour and forty-five minutes of the screenplay is a word for word adaptation from the play. Not a problem. There is original writing surrounding Frankie Valli's daughter, Francine, which was necessary and well done. The treatment used on Broadway for this plot point would never have worked on film. And with this original writing, you get to see Young, as Frankie, display some impressive acting chops in the diner scene. Then, sadly, when he gets the 'death call' the directing and editing of this pivotal scene is ham handed and blunt and the scene fall flat on its face. It could NOT have been handled worse; from the awkward staging of the entrances and exits, to the camera angle during the call, and Valli's final awareness of the death of his daughter is chopped off practically in mid sentence. John Lloyd Young, from the Broadway 'Jersey Boys' also stars in the film. His acting ability both on Broadway and in this film (a tricky transition) is amazing. He was powerful in both. His voice, amazing as it can be, has pitch problems, which in a live Broadway show is one thing, in a film it's another. Apparently all the singer/actors in the main roles performed live like, oh what was that movie where they did that, oh yeah, Les Miserable!!! They weren't exactly Russel Crow but post production could have done something about the consistent pitch problems throughout the voices and numbers. In fact the whole 'group' never gelled musically once in this film. Their voices don't blend and chords are out of tune everywhere. Then you have the added fatal flaw of Clint Eastwood's unimaginative handling of the storyline and production choices. For God's sake, Lloyd's 70's wig looks like it was stolen from a Vegas Elvis impersonator. Was there no one on the set to say, 'Hey Clint, 70's Frankie looks like a cheap Elvis impersonator.' These may sound like small things, but it's the plethora of small and big things that just strangles this film in its crib. Eastwood does a face plant with this indestructible blueprint. It's flat, flat, flat. What is this film supposed to be about? Music! But the singing is not good here. The Four Season's music alone starts this film off with an 11 out of 10. By the time Eastwood is done, his -10 handling brings us to 0 and I'm giving it one star out of sympathy for the cast and the music. Who's idea was it to give this film to him???This nearly word for word screenplay adaptation only works if it's done fast and in your face with quick edits and lots of snark. Here, it just falls flat (there's that word again), scene after scene, line after line. I am willing to bet that Eastwood never even went to see the Jersey Boys on Broadway before he took this project on. It's as if someone handed him the book, he said roll, then said cut, and everyone went home with a check.If the Broadway Jersey Boys is not accessible to you, and this is the only Jersey Boys you do have access to, I'm not sure that you will gain much from this experience. I saw the original cast on Broadway twice with John Lloyd Wright. He was great both times and he's great here as far as his acting goes. He's not the best 'Frankie' I've seen by a long shot. Christopher Walken once again proves that he is better at acting than most directors in charge of him. He's the only one who comes out of this unscathed. He can steal a scene with three words or a look. Brilliant. I've seen Jersey Boys six/seven, times in all. Different 'Frankies' different 'Tommy's'. Every time though, that show blows the roof off the theater. This film just blows. And that's one man's fault, Clint Eastwood. His flat footed handling of a great story, with great talent, and great music doom it from the first frame. You would think it would be fool proof. It's not.",1,9,13,5 April 2015
