Casablanca," The best film I have ever seen
","There is nothing I can say about Michael Curtiz's masterwork Casablanca(1942)that hasn't already been said by thousands, perhaps millions, of cinema lovers over the past 70 years. There aren't enough superlatives in the dictionary to describe just how perfectly the story, the characters, the images, the music, the sounds and all elements of the film's production are presented. The thing that sets Casablanca apart from the other films universally considered as being among the greatest of all time including Citizen Kane(1941) and The Godfather Part I(1972)and Part II(1974), among others, is the comedy of the piece. To balance the heart wrenching and soul shattering effects of war, occupation, fascism, betrayal and lost love with so much high quality comedy and so many great jokes is just stunning. Importantly, the comic elements disarm the audience without distracting from the life and death tension of the surroundings of the film. The emotions of the piece all feel very real and genuine and the audience is allowed into the lives of these characters in a way that very few films allow. Bogart's Rick is just about the coolest guy in the history of the world and Bergman's Ilsa it just about the most beautiful and charming woman in the history of the world. Claude Rains contributes a masterfully enigmatic performance as the police Captain Louis Renault and the entire cast of characters makes the place and the era come bursting to life. Curtiz's use of light and shadows sets the perfect tone for this perfect film and all elements of production are perfectly on point. I can't say for certain that Casablanca is the greatest film that has ever been made as I haven't seen them all but there's a pretty damn good chance that it is.",10,2,3,12 March 2011
Citizen Kane," A great achievement in filmmaking, but ya gotta have heart
","The first time I watched Orson Welles' Citizen Kane(1941) I had some trouble with following the film because of the unusual story telling structure. Upon watching it for a second time I was able to follow the story and the character development and it certainly improved my enjoyment of the film. I can certainly understand why so many rank it as the greatest film ever made, the groundbreakingly inventive visual style of the film is incredibly impressive and with the knowledge that this was Welles' first film it was an amazing achievement. But for my own personal enjoyment of a work of fiction I need to feel a personal connection to the characters. Charles Foster Kane is necessarily a character that the audience cannot connect with as his enigmatic and distant nature is the whole point of the film but I found it difficult to connect to any of the characters on any level, they all left me feeling cold. I think that perhaps with more repeat viewings I'll be able to penetrate the extreme density of the film further and may in time come to truly appreciate it but for the moment I'll have to remain incredibly impressed but not quite entertained.",8,0,1,11 May 2011
Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid," Seeing Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid the way it was meant to be seen
","George Roy Hill's Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid(1969) has long been one of my favorite films. The combination of great photography of amazing landscapes, a brilliantly witty and charming script by William Goldman and outstanding performances by two of the great leading men in the history of American cinema make the film one of the most watchable and most enjoyable pictures I'm sure I will ever see. I had watched the film at least half a dozen times but upon learning that the film would be screened in Albany's Palace Theatre as part of SEFCU's Classic Movie Series I leapt at the chance to see Butch, Sundance and Etta on the big screen in a beautifully designed local landmark. It was an amazing experience, complete with the old fashioned 'Let's go out to the lobby' cartoons and scratches and blotches on the over 40 year old film stock this was the genuine article and it felt as if I had traveled back in time for two hours. A great film and a great experience and I'd encourage anyone to see Butch Cassidy or any other classic film on the silver screen.",10,1,2,13 May 2011
The Grapes of Wrath," Very nearly a perfect film, a wonderful adaptation of a great novel
","John Ford's The Grapes of Wrath(1940), an adaptation of perhaps the greatest American novel ever written, does great justice to it's source material. The film is a bit more optimistic and a bit less gritty than the novel but the complex emotions, relationships and social messages of Steinbeck's masterpiece are wonderfully expressed in the film. The acting performances in the film are just about flawless with Jane Darwell contributing one of the great performances in the history of cinema with a tour de force in her portrayal of Ma Joad. Ford's direction is absolutely outstanding in his achievements in setting the perfect tone and mood with great lighting, visuals, sounds and art direction. The only thing keeping me from giving the film a 10 out of 10 is the slightly inconsistent performance by Henry Fonda as Tom. Overall it was a wonderful performance but there were times when it seemed to me like he was hitting the wrong notes. If I were allowed to give the film a 9.8 I would but I just couldn't quite give it a 10. Nevertheless, The Grapes of Wrath(1940)represents American film-making and story-telling at it's finest and it should be required viewing for all American citizens.",9,0,1,12 March 2011
Annie Hall," A neurotic love letter to the city of New York
",If you love New York City and you love comedy then you must love Woody Allen's Annie Hall(1977). Allen's presentation of the Big Apple captures everything that makes it the greatest city in the world and Allen's sense of humor ranks with the greatest comedic minds in cinematic history. The way that Allen is able to incorporate so many jokes into what is basically an existential examination of romantic relationships is revolutionary and has influenced a generation of comedians to explore deeper issues through the use of comedy but none have been able to match the genius of Allen and his work in Annie Hall. Woody Allen's comedy is something of an acquired taste but I have a hard time believing that anyone who watches Annie Hall and doesn't enjoy it isn't an anti-Semite.,9,0,0,13 May 2011
The Graduate," A rare combination of great comedy and compelling drama
","Mike Nichols' The Graduate(1967) has all of the elements that make for a truly great film and Nichols deftly handles all of the elements in creating one of the most iconic films in the history of cinema. The acting, photography, writing, music and tone are all flawless. As a comedy or a drama alone it would shine but the film's ability to combine the two is what makes it historic. Dustin Hoffman's Benjamin Braddock represents a generation of young people who see the world far differently than their parents and grandparents and believes that the meaning of life is not found through climbing a corporate ladder or following the path that is set before you by others but by making your own way and enjoying life at every turn. This was something of a revolutionary philosophy in the 1960s and the social significance of The Graduate was just as great as it's comedy and drama.",10,0,0,13 May 2011
Singin' in the Rain," A sharp and delightful film
","Gene Kelly and Stanley Donen's Singin' in the Rain(1952) is very nearly flawless. Great performances from Kelly, Reynolds and O'Connor entertain and impress throughout. The pacing of the film is absolutely spot on with jokes, emotional moments, entertaining musical numbers, impressive achievements in dance that all combine to create perhaps the greatest 'feel-good' film ever made. I hate to focus on the negative as there are so many positives but I feel that the only thing keeping it from being a perfect film was the extended sequence of the musical within the musical with the 'Gotta Dance' routine. The interactions between Kelly, Reynolds and O'Connor absolutely made the picture and as Kelly goes off on his own the film loses it's plot and it's heart. As an audience member I had fallen in love with Reynolds' and O'Connor's characters and being without them for such a lengthy period just felt wrong. Despite the departure, the film stands as one of the most enjoyable and entertaining works of all-time, I'll just have fast forward through that sequence in the future.",9,0,1,11 May 2011
