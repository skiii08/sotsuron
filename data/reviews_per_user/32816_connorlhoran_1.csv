Hereditary," Absolutely Terrible , I believe the director owes me money for my wasted time.
","This film from start to finish was horrendous. The plot is subpar and hides behind the mask of 'its metaphorical and philosophical ' . It tries to hard to be artsy. What makes the film difficult is the fact is has no backstory. In order for the viewer to understand the fear, there has to be a reason to it. The film attempts to be mysterious but comes off more like heroin junkies bad nightmare. You end up leaving the film just saying 'WTF'",1,5,16,12 October 2019
