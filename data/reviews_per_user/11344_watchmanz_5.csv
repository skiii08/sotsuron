United 93," A fitting tribute to lives lost
","A good movie, not only for its entertainment value but also because of its message. We still don't know exactly everything that happened on that fateful day and we may never know, but this movie accurately portrays what we know so far in respect of this particular flight. The director did an excellent job, showing the determination and the human weakness common to us all in both the passengers and the hijackers. The relationships were accurately portrayed and tension was realistically created right to the end. Some scenes were a little drawn out in places but the overall effect was an excellent movie with a message for us all. The cast did an excellent job in accurately portraying the tensions that must have been felt by all on that plane. All in all, an excellent piece of cinematic achievement that forms part of history lesson for the future, to commemorate all who died on that fateful day.",9,1,2,19 September 2006
Deja Vu," Great movie
","When it first started I thought it was boring - the ferry and the band etc. No hint of what was to come though, and at the end I was sorry it had finished. Spectacular cinematography, Denzel Washington is always great, and a twisting story line make this an engrossing and entertaining movie. The plot is based upon scientific probable reality although, being a movie, it twists and turns into ways that make the probable reality impossible. Hints of 'Big Brother', hints of future scientific achievements, a modern day terrorist plot, and fantastic acting. This must be one of the better movies I've seen this year and I'd recommend everyone to go and see it. I gave it an 8 out of 10 only because I'm interested in the probably scientific reality the movie deals with, and was disappointed the script went into paradoxes and other scientific non-probabilities instead of dealing more accurately with the scientific theory behind the whole movie. All in all though, it was great - I'll be seeing this one again.",8,1,2,19 December 2006
Silent Hill," Utter drivel
","This would have to be the worst movie I have seen in a long time. Not a single thing is believable, the acting is poor (the kid is the best actor), and the special effects are pitiful. I was prepared to be entertained and perhaps even frightened, instead I was bored almost to the point of walking out. The beginning is hard to follow, the middle defies any intelligence the viewer may have, and then ending is a poor attempt at trying to be a 'what if' twilight zone feature. If you want to watch this I'd suggest quite a few beers or wines beforehand to try and make it entertaining. If you're after mind-numbing rubbish then go for it, if you want decent entertainment try another movie.",1,27,56,18 September 2006
World Trade Center," Wasted opportunity
","Not as good as I thought I would be. It was less about the World Trade Center events of September 11th, rather than a story of the Port Authority cops and two who became trapped in the rubble. Some parts of it were good but other parts were boring, and the boring parts far outweighed the good parts. For anyone directly affected by the events of that day, it will probably have special significance and meaning, but to me it was far short of what this movie could have been. In comparison I felt 'United 93' was a far superior movie and the opportunity this movie could have taken to pay homage to those who perished on that day was wasted. It is difficult to make a great movie about such tragic events, especially when so many of those directly affected are still alive to judge the movie, but this was just a rescue movie based on two or three characters, when it could have so easily been a great tribute to all those who perished, survived, and gave of themselves on that day and the days shortly thereafter. The typical US hero-achieves-against-outstanding-odds-complete-with-stirring-music didn't endear me to the movie either - the opportunity to real make a fitting memorial to all affected was lost, and that saddens me. Five out of 10 because it was still a good story and because Nick Cage is one of my favorite actors, but I wouldn't recommend it, and wouldn't watch it again.",5,1,4,8 October 2006
Happy Feet," Brilliant!
","What a great movie! It started slowly and I was wondering whether it would ever get started, but once it did it had me enthralled. Excellent graphics, brilliant song track and voices, and a fantastic holiday season movie. What is even more important is the underlying messages in the movie. Messages about accepting those who may be different to us, and the importance of conservation. Even deeper are comments on religion and superstition. I recommend this movie to everybody - not just the children. We can all be entertained by this film and, what's more important, we can all learn something from it too. 10/10 from me - a brilliant movie with no faults.",10,2,4,3 December 2006
