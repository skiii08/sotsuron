Kill Bill: Vol. 2," not as good as vol 1
","me being a huge fan of Quentin Tarantino I was looking forward to seeing Kill Bill vol 1. It was great. Not one of his best, but still great. Now I've been anticipating vol 2 for months after it was delayed to april. It goes straight into the action, with a little introduction at the wedding, this being the first time I'd seen Bill's face. Generally this isn't as violent as vol 1, apart from one scene when the Bride is fighting Elle, but their is much more of a story. Vol 2 concentrates more on the love story between Bill and the Bride (whose name you also find out)and also you see where the Bride got all of her skills (the Pai Mei scene is very good). I was a bit dissapointed with the ending (though I'm sure we all know what happens at the end)I thought it could have happened a bit better, and Bill compares the Bride to Superman, which is just plain strange, but that's Tarantino for you. A bit of dissapointment after vol 1, but still a good film with some generally good scenes in it but not one Tarantino's best.",5,2,6,23 April 2004
A Bug's Life," PIXAR's worst movie
","I saw Toy Story and thought it was one of the most brilliant and creative films ever. However, when I saw A Bug's Life when it came out at the cinemas, though I was only 8, I still thought it was a pile of crap. It all just seems too happy compared to all of PIXAR's other films. Adults can enjoy all of PIXAR's other films, whereas A Bug's Life has nothing for adults. The story was weak and there was nothing to else to help the film, as there were no new visual techniques used.Compared to the likes of Monster's Inc. and Toy Story this film is nothing.",4,3,10,23 February 2004
The Matrix Reloaded," one of the worst films I have ever seen
","What the hell was all that about? I saw The Matrix and was amazed. It was the most spectacular movie ever made. What ever possesed the Wachowski brothers to do this film is beyond me.There is no plot, you can't argue with that. Basically all this film was was a load of talking, and don't get me wrong, I have no problem with talky films, but all the talking in The Matrix Reloaded was a pointless load of drivvle. Then there would be a fight sequence which lasted WAY too long, then more pointless drivvle, then another fight scene that lasts too long and it all builds up to the biggest anti-climax ever. A little bearded bloke talking a load of uncomprehensible bull for 20 minutes.Also, Keanu Reeves gives his worst performance yet. I knew he wasn't a good actor but this was beyond a joke. If you watch his films in the order he was in them it would seem he got gradually worse as they went along. God knows what his performance is like in Something's Gotta Give! Keanu Reeves: The only plank of wood ever to become an actor.After the splendor of the first film this came as a massive dissapointment. If you haven't already seen the first film I suggest you watch it, but don't waste your time with this utter pile of turd.",4,0,0,23 February 2004
