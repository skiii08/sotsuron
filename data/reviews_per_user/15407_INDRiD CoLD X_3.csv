The Ring," One of the creepiest movies I've seen
","I have been waiting for this movie ever since I heard about the original Japanese version back in 1998. I heard that it broke box office records in Japan, Hong Kong, and Singapore and also won awards at film festivals in the US. When I heard that, I automatically knew that it would be great and one of the creepiest movies I had ever seen. When I finally got to see the US release, I was soooo shocked at just how much I loved this movie. I really didn't think that I would get that creeped out, but the whole time I was shivering and so tense that I thought I was just gonna freak out in the theater. When I left the theater, my heart was pounding and I couldn't stop thinking about it for days!!  This movie is a definite for all movie fans!!! If you haven't seen this movie, you better go out and see it right away. I give it a 10 out of 10.",10,0,0,19 October 2002
Final Destination 2," Very Good Sequel
","In my opinion, this movie is the best horror movie sequel ever made. Everyone has been complaining that it has no story to it, and it's not original like the first one. But what do you expect! Of course it's gonna have the same plot. It's a little obvious by the commercial!, but you go to the theater to have fun, and because you liked the first one, or there wouldn't be a reason for you to be there!The opening scene to this movie was very well done. It was very cool and very intense. I don't know if it had the same affect as the first movie's opening scene, but it was definitely up there. This movie is really gory (which is always a plus!) and there were some very intense moments.Overall, if you liked the first one, you'll definitely love this one. I give it a: 9 out of 10",Null,0,0,15 April 2003
Mulholland Drive," A Very good mystery
","When I saw the commercial for this movie, I was expecting a good movie. When I finally had the chance to rent it, I thought it was great! This movie has so much class to it that makes it so respectable. The storyline in the movie is great and the acting is done well too. Every scene in this movie seems to hypnotize you and it stays in your mind forever. If you want to see a great mystery drama, then rent this movie! You wont regret it.",Null,0,1,11 August 2002
