Deja Vu," Wow!!
","Other than knowing it was a Denzel/Bruckheimer (sp?) movie, which was enough to get me there, I didn't know what else to expect. I saw a trailer at a Focus Group on 'The Sentinel' and decided it looked intriguing enough I was going to see it. I definitely wasn't disappointed! One thing I would like someone who hasn't see it to pay attention to though and comment on. This won't spoil the movie at all, just watch and please report back.I have heard of theater's/ studios changing certain aspects of a movie for different regions. I want to know if this is the case in this movie. On the front of the ambulance, there was an 'Olathe Ford' license plate on the front. That is the city I viewed it in. Is this in all the theater's? If so, bravo to their (Olathe Ford's) PR people or maybe just a coincidence?",9,8,17,23 November 2006
