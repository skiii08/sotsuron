The Blair Witch Project," Save your money!
","If you've ever wondered what it would be like to see a film with truly abysmal acting and a storyline too weak for Saturday morning cartoons, this is it!  'I'm cold, I'm tired, I'm lost, I'm scared' is more suitable for a bunch of toddlers on a field trip.  I had high hopes, too!  But it was utterly unconvincing.  Don't believe the paid professional movie critics, that promise 'the film makers turned a liability into an asset' by using mere 16mm film and hand-held videocam.  It's a crock!  Imagine having to watch the very worst of America's Funniest Home Videos thrown into a blender with only the reaction shots of the victims in When Animals Attack, with all the predator footage taken out.  As Porky Pig says: That's all, folks!  A prime candidate for future parody and satire.",1,0,2,10 August 1999
