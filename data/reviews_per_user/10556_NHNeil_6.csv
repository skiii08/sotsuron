The Blair Witch Project," The only good thing is that it's short.
","Who found this terrible movie scary? Almost shut it off in the first twenty-five minutes; When it ended I wish I had. Can't decide who was more annoying: Heather Donahue from this movie or Shelley Duvall(Wendy Torrance) from The Shining. If the whole thing were true it may have been interesting but I could pretty much make this movie in my backyard this weekend. What a joke. The only good thing about this movie is that it's less than ninety minutes long. What's next: 'Watching Paint Dry' starring Andy Kaufman? (Oh yeah, that annoying idiot is dead). Can't wait too see the annoying Jim Carrey playing the annoying Andy Kaufman. ANNOYING!!!",1,1,3,8 December 1999
The Hustler," None better
","One of the best movies ever made. I can think of none better. Paul Newman, Jackie Gleason & George C. Scott all were tremendous. The kind of movie you can see over and over. Watch the movie and then go and shoot pool; You'll play  200% better, at least temporarily. Look for Willie Mosconi !",10,3,4,27 September 1999
Notting Hill," More Spike
","Would have rated this movie a 4 but gave it a 6 only because of Rhys Ifans (Spike). He definitely should have had more exposure. This guys funny, the rest is just so-so. See it just for Spike. The movie left me with no feeling one way or the other. Blah!",6,0,0,27 December 1999
Halloween," Perspective changes over time
","Sorry it took me twenty-four years to comment on this movie; I've been busy. As I look back at all the horror movies and sequels made, I have come to realize that Halloween was one of my favorites. Never got tired throughout the years of looking at Jamie Lee Curtis. After watching more than my share of the terrible horror movies that have come out in the last quarter century (God, I feel old), I would have to say that Halloween has most of them beat. I could have been perfectly satisfied with no Halloween II, III, IV or V, but Halloween I was well made and scared the bejesus out of me more than once.",8,0,0,11 October 2002
Trainspotting," Feces isn't fun
","Guess as I get older I just don't get it anymore. If you like movies with feces in them, then this is your kind of film. Two scenes I can remember anyway. Dead babies, friends who don't give a damn about each other and an overall feeling of filth is what I think of when I think about this lame movie. How this ever got in the top 250, I'll never know.",1,43,110,11 April 2003
Before Sunrise," Don't waste your money
","Saw this piece of crap last month and I have one suggestion for all; don't waste your money to rent this piece of garbage. I really can't understand how anyone could enjoy this movie and have a hard time getting it through my head why it was made in the first place. As a matter of fact, I don't know why I'm wasting my time even talking about such a lousy movie. The main characters acting as if they an ounce of intelligence is not believable. The movie goes nowhere and all copies of this movie should be destroyed.......blaaagh!!!",1,15,44,5 May 2002
