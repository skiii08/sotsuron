Conquest 1453," Exaggeration and Sublimation of Ottoman History
","Almost everything in the movie, is very blown up: Costumes, characters, places... Not everything fits to what really happened back then, nor does it have to. But that doesn't mean that the director has the right to irritatingly twist history in favor of conservatives in Turkey.He falsely presents Emperor Mehmet II as a superhero that makes almost no mistakes, and as a monogamous person. Of course, the facts that he was a wine drinker, a lover of ancient Greek and Roman arts, that he let the city to be sacked for two days, he hanged one of his viziers, and killed all his brothers and made a law that allows and suggests his successors to kill their brothers 'for continuation of the state', were all ignored! And we see 'the enemies' always speak with a sneaky voice which shows that they're the coward and evil guys. Byzantine Emperor has a weird 'digital palace' that has numberless columns, and lives in corruption. War scenes and military costumes are so unrealistic, as well... The list goes on.Shortly, what I saw was a religious, peasant point of view and a foolish sublimation of Ottoman history. That's what happens with big budget and very limited mentality.",3,164,253,18 September 2012
Taken 2," Disappointing and Full of Prejuice and Mispresentation
","I ignore all the annoying and false things like they chose to shoot the movie in the worst possible streets, the girl can freely throw grenades in crowded streets of Istanbul, the Turkish police using junkie cars and 80% of the women in Turkey are covered in black sheets... However, there's one more grave mistake that can't be overstated. What the hell is 'US Embassy' doing in Istanbul? US embassy is in Ankara where is the capital of the country! There's only a 'US consulate' in Istanbul, that has a nice and mighty building which they could have and should have used. You don't have to be an expert on Turkey to make a movie there, but being unaware of its true capital and presenting another city as capital reveal a unique level of ignorance.And the story in general was weak. It's obvious that they wanted to make more money from success of the first movie. You can watch it for guns and blazings.",3,1,2,23 December 2012
