First Man," I wasn't expecting such an incredible movie
","A few comments:All the 'boring' comments here, and elsewhere on the web leave me thinking they must be kids.. but even then, I don't understand the hate. The man literally lead an out-of-this-world life with outstanding achievements. That alone can't be labled boring, but the fact that this film has paid respect to Armstrong's life and work in such a beautifully cinematic and respectful way? I don't really understand some people.I hesitated watching this flick as I saw the trailer in which Janet Shearon (Claire Foy) is angrily berating a group of NASA scientists telling them they're 'a bunch of boys playing with toys'.. or something along those lines. I rolled my eyes and didn't even finish the trailer.Eventually I watched it, purely out of nothing else to do at the time and quite honestly expecting to roll my eyes out of their socket until I fell asleep.The review:From the moment of the first opening scene - my heart was in my mouth. It was just so intense and placed you right in the cockpit with Armstrong. This is done through a means I usually cannot stand - shaky camera and extreme close ups. I mean, I really can't express enough how much I despise shaky camera and full face close ups. And yet here, it works in a way I never thought possible for such a technique.As a huge Sci Fi fan I'd rate this as a great Sci Fi film. The family scenes not only didn't make me want to cringe and barf (a usual reaction to family drama), but were instead touching in such a way that I felt a real heart ache for Armstrong and his wife, Janet - the drives and millstones.The music was perfect for every scene. I take my hat off to Justin Herwitz. Every actor played the part to a T. I take my hat off to Damien Chazelle. I didn't know it was the same guy as Whiplash going into the film. Will definitely watch La La Land now.",9,2,4,22 November 2018
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Everyone's so morally outraged? 1-3 star reviews? Sign of times.
","I'm 39. I grew up watching Star Wars on UK Christmas TV, and later on VHS. I wouldn't say they were the be-all-and-end-all for me (like some of my childhood friends), but of course they were a real treat and gave me a taste of a future love; sci-fi. This film transported me right back there. I loved it. There's so much goodness packed into it, from the brilliantly dark characters, to the genuinely funny comedy, awesome fight scenes, vibrant colours and lovely cinematography from faces to landscapes. It really is a triumph and I thoroughly enjoyed it. Some of the close up shots somehow feel so 80s, and nice touches like focusing on feet movement etc like old samurai flicks. The story had me engrossed throughout. The whole cast did a stellar job. Adam Driver I was unsure of having only seen him in Logan Lucky, but he did a top job. Yes.. more like this please! Don't let the 1-3 star reviews from the 'heartbroken' and easily offended take away the awesomeness of this gem. btw, IMDb - what's up with the reviews sorting 'Ordered By: Helpfulness'. It used tobe you could sort it by love/hate etc. You should implement that again, otherwise you end up with pages and pages of 1-3 star reviews before you find a real, honest review (same as War for the Planet of the Apes)",9,1,3,30 January 2018
