Ford v Ferrari," break at dennys
","At about 11am the guys all decided to turn their engines off and give away all their cash to ignited gasoline. The day ends at Denny's. One of the racers sits at a table with a huge picture laminated on the surface. Pulls a huge piece of black paper out of his pocket, un-folds it, and covers the table. He is then forced to peek around the corner, only to see the same picture on a t shirt worn by a laying down 900lbs dog.",1,6,14,12 March 2020
50 First Dates," Review
","This is a good one. Gentle souls in this one. Dramatic storyline, colorful views, capures the twirling human forces pretty good. Tall man does a back flip over sandler. Sandler ignores it and moves on to his feasting. Sandler drives the boat calling out. Does it turn out good? Does it turn out bad? Or is it that sandler will all of a sudden be able to keep quiet and not have to do anything at all? (stuff never ends like that because we're controlled). You'll have to watch it.",9,3,3,9 April 2020

","The main villan (i forget her name) is unstoppable. And she proves it in this movie. The beginning of the film is a carbon copy of the end. A dog is shown runnig through a park on a freezing night. while the villian comfortably sits in her vehicle watching him with one of those ghost smiles (like a person that is done with everything).

","Terminator genesis into the discussion here. Because its been said that both films (and all other films) have existed in all the points in time. Sara Conner (played by Emilia Clark) was born in a barn, woke up, and left the barn to try and live in the main house with the other people. But the year is 1901 and actress (Clark) is only a kid, not even a seasoned actress yet. So how is it that when she enters the house her mother holds out both terminator Genesis and passengers (dvds) to show Emilia? Of course the dvds were just drawings, sketches by a profit. Spooked Emilia then runs on all fours back into the barn, with her mother in hot pursuit. her mother says: 'please come into the house, use the bathroom and use the running water, we'll go get you a pink pillow case for your bed.' But Emilia did not want to hold a real life, and, of course did not want to eventually play character roles in passengers and terminator Genesis.",10,2,3,11 February 2020

","Look at the crab scene closely. He dances, sings (his lips off). Also, the story line in this movie is inspiring, in a logical highly controlled way.

Fast & Furious 6," It was ok.
","Its like watching a brotherhood of high performance monkeys passing Doritos to each other. It's like watching a tight-nit family on Christmas day; they're all there all happy and feeling important as they exchange gifts. She gets a new bowel of hangers and he gets 17 new fleece togas and of course all of them get comfortable with someone they'd give their life for. It's an exciting movie. Once these people start talking to each other you get the feeling they're on a special quest, it makes you want jump on the big screen with them and roll with some big time crowd, maybe even be like Vin diesel, driving fast cars and picking up shotguns from stores. 'The Rock' showed up in every scene of this movie like a boy scout, always keeping tings shipshape. When the rock caught wind of the tank chase he immediately ordered someone to get him a chopper so he could fly there. The tank chase featured characters like Ortiz, Vin diesel, Kelly, and Paul walker being consumed by a supreme whirlwind of drama. But The rock accidentally showed up at the end of the chase. He circled in his helicopter from above surveying the damage and said 'Jesus Christ,' which was a dignified thing to say.",7,3,4,24 August 2016

He stares, blanked faced for a moment, as though he can see a thousand miles in front of him, attaining a capacity that a dog would have who is stranded in the winter. The dog having a double choice.

","That is a fair movie. 'We need a naw vehicle.' That line was funny. There was a decent storyline and it didnt get too scrambled in order to distract viewers from lacking work (like terminator genesis and dark fate). Bad terminator was believable.

","Max was born during 'The indigo wave' (stage performance) by way of plastic tubing. The mayor wanted him birthed at this performance so it would be the first thing he saw. And from there on he was to be raised and trained by the robots. They had of course stated (in this documentary film) that 1941 was the year things like this started to be allowed. So film maker 'Ronald gear' wanted to show us what happened with Max rose (portrayed by Ewan). Training for Max began from birth, from there on he stayed moving in a bus. The trainer robots arrived on and left the bus, taking different shifts. Some were nicer to max: those who chilled a portion of his mind and affixed a cardboard box over his eyesight which contained a scene of the night sky and a glowing moon. Then there were the nasty robots who worked Max to the extreme, at one point in this documentary he was slapped in the thigh by one of them. Maxes stage performance meant bench pressing a water melon and then suddenly stopping to relax his body and facial expressions, completely. The play was about life and death, that's what max was trained for.",7,2,2,13 February 2020

Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," George Lucas, next time plan your future, thoroughly
","Granted there were some new ideas in this movie, (very few!) a lot of the original George Lucas material was rehashed or recycled within this new 'money making' star wars commercialized 'SYSTEM.' In one of the climactic scenes ('revenue generators') we see kylo, Ray, and snuke can be substituted with Luke sky walker, the emperor, and Darth Vader. Ray watches through a window as her 'rebel friends' are being decimated while she is simultaneously being pressured to turn to the dark side by kylo and snuke (will she buckle under the pressure? I ask, I, a rusty tripped up 50 year old man reclining in my rocker, already having seen 'The return of the Jedi' from the 80's). Did Luke give in back then?!!!! =No But we already saw that play out, we've seen it!!. Kylo, even for the most part, rescued Ray from snuke like Darth Vader rescued Luke from the emperor; dramatic right? wrong!!). So why did Disney reuse this scene almost exactly the way George had it and why do they keep reusing everything else? Because Disney is trying to drain money from a naive star wars community; they strategically perused something they knew had 'made a killing' in the past and maximized profit margins. They've already made 3 movies in 2 years, and they will keep hanging bait in front of us until we finally deem it as rotten! JJ Abrams and Disney did the same with their other star wars film, they copied the entire plot from 'a new hope' 1977. George Lucas, you said it yourself, 'These are my kids' Now theyre your basterds!! You shouldn't have sold it for 4 billion but I forgive you, only YOUR movies are epic, creative, fluent, dramatic, very good efforts.Daisy Ridley=fickle, Kylo Ren=no
