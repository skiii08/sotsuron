The Incredible Hulk," Can't Wait The Director's Cut ... Deleted Scenes Would Make It a Perfect 10
","I really enjoyed this movie until I saw the deleted scenes on the DVD. Then, I realized that including some of those scenes would've made this film a pure masterpiece. I hope they give us a director's cut or that 'Norton' cut we have all heard about. As is, even in an era when an explosion of comic-book superheroes are hitting the big screen, Hulk stands alone. This has nothing to do with being a blind superhero fan. It has everything to do with the classic Jekell and Hyde story with a great twist and awesome spectacles everywhere you look. There are plenty of scenes that you have to see to believe. The concluding battle is one for the ages. What's special is that it is held together by some great acting and a sci-fi but believable story (so very rare for a summer 'blockbuster') Banner is likable and the Hulk isn't some victim, he's the hero this time around. I really like this movie but would love it if they put a few of those deleted scenes back in to the film. (ALL the Bruce/Betty relationship stuff, the Ross cigar filled room speech, the pre-helicopter stuff, etc.)",Null,5,9,7 May 2009
Star Trek," Hyper and Too Slick For Its Own Good
","I know people have said that they didn't want a retread but what's wrong with sticking with what works? This movie is so desperate to modernize the legend that it loses its soul along the way. Is putting a slick, 21st century character spin on these characters worth putting up with what's lost in the translation? The movie is slick and hyper but it's not very good. Are a few good explosions worth wasting 120 minutes of time? For me, the answer is a resounding 'No!' There are far better ways to spend your movie money than this too slick for its own good movie represented by JJ Abrams's latest endeavor. Putting aside the hamfisted plot (which is unevenly awful), all that's left is a woefully underwritten motion picture that starts off interesting enough but is smothered under each hyper and slick scene until all you have is a film that gets smothered under its own attempt at being slick.",Null,41,126,7 May 2009
Captain America: The First Avenger," One of the better action/adventure movies in recent memory!!!
","I can see why everyone is praising Captain America in some way. Cap manages to deliver a little bit of everything and does it with style and integrity. This extremely talented cast fit each character perfectly, both large and especially the smaller roles. The story itself is told in a masterful, crisp manner. The dialogue is witty and the humor works its way seamlessly in to the natural order of the story. The film certainly is smart but it's fun first and foremost. Comic book style slugfests are certainly part of the fun but are inserted as a vehicle for the story and not just to see CGI things explode. Things aren't blown up just for the sake of seeing them go boom. What makes Captain America as good as any Marvel film is the fact that it's a fine film for kids but it's even greater if you're an intelligent adult. How many movies can pull that off? Like Thor and the Iron Man films, this is movie-making of the most entertaining order and it easily deserves all the praise it has generated from both fans and critics alike. It makes anyone long for that Avengers film to be sure.I don't want to make any deep insinuations or start trouble but Captain America's depth of emotion and character combined with tremendous fun and action means this could very well be the best comic book movie produced this year. For a year that's this loaded, that's really saying something. It's superb in every way. I love the fact that the film sets up fine but it doesn't dwell in darkness or get bogged down the way a lot of origin films often do. It lays enough groundwork but then advances a kick butt story. There's no doubt, comic book or not, it's one of the better action/adventure movies in recent memory.",Null,7,15,29 July 2011
The Soloist," Downey Is Great but Poor Direction Sinks the Overall Tone
","Robert Downey Jr. does not disappoint. He brings his 'A-Game' and then some as he delivers a compelling and layered performance. The rest of the cast (including Foxx) is remarkably average. That has more to do with the writing then the quality of the actors themselves. What hurts this film seems to be the director. You can feel his heavy hand on too many scenes. It's almost as if you can see him trying to find a way to make the film more compelling but failing at every turn. Strobe crazy lights filling the entire screen linked to the music, snot filled babies on TV, chaotic voices in surround sound trying to give the audience the feel of losing grip on reality...they all fail. Maybe the story itself didn't warrant feature length film consideration and drawing out the film didn't help matters. RDJr does make up for a lot of flaws and the stagnant pace but only to a certain degree.",Null,0,1,7 May 2009
