Hereditary," A complete waste of time
","We read the reviews before watching this movie, both positive and negative.
We both went in with an open mind, and were still very disappointed.
The trailer looked like it would be a great horror/mystery, but the movie failed to deliver.
We spend most of the time waiting for SOMETHING to happen.
And yes it is pretty and has good actors, but it was just sooo boring.
We were tempted to stop watching multiple times, but wanted to give it a fair chance so we watched til the end. And boy do we regret it.",1,5,11,8 November 2018
