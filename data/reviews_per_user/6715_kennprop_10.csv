Come and See," horrific but not as awful as the reality that happened
",This is based on actual events that happened on the Eastern Front in WW2. The Nazi deeds were monstrous.The suffering of the civilians and common atrocities were done in the name of Hitlers crazy ideology. Ethnic cleansing and industrialized murder were commonplace. This is based on the brutal reality that caused casualties on this front of more than 30 million . Mans depravity as seen thru the eyes of a teenager. A coming of age movie set in an apocalyptic time period. This movie has some Russian quirks but still rates as a monumental film.,4,2,7,11 May 2018
The Irishman," Long, kind of Mafia formula movie
","6.5 This is long and draggy.Deniro is too old for the part of the young Shearan. He also walks like an older man.His body looks it's age. The aging only works for the end scenes.It is not a great concept. You never get a read as to what made Shearan into a killer.His experiences inWW2? Shearan in real life was a large guy at 6' 4' .BobbyD. does not look like him. This movie had a similar concept as Goodfellas,the same type of music, similar to A Bronx tale. It's not the Godfather ,just as long.Pacino stole the show as the stubborn Jimmy Hoffa. Joe Pesci is a rather low key benign mafia guy. Are we supposed to think a for hire killer would want or need a daughter's love? If you say so but it was not convincing. Ensemble Italian mafia actors are always in these types of movies.That is why they are so similar and formulaic. Same faces ,music, draggy.",6,3,9,30 November 2019
The Grapes of Wrath," Not as connected story wise as the book
","The film is somewhat choppy as a story, the book isnt. The book has a much different ending. The supporting actors in the film are excellent and are seen again and again in Fords westerns. The main characters are fiery Tom Joad and his rock of the family mother 'Ma'. They dominate the film.The black and white scenery is typical Ford. the situations are too - good or bad. The dialogue is straight forward and the sound quality shows its age.I dont think the condemning of the capitalist system is as strong as in the book. The book has more nuance. The govt camp run by the people and govt by extension is the better way togo. Most of the existing society outside of this camp is fascist, police controlled, American Legion Nazi, exploitive and very greedy. Its a decent movie made to showcase the Depression Era effects on ' white Anglo Saxon 'American' land owners.' No people of black, or brown hue are in the movie. Evidently their problems did not exist. Its a classic , kind of dated ,yet relevant for today. California, the golden land, is a metaphor for the United States. Evidently the streets are not paved with gold and the reality falls short of the rhetoric in the US....People are exploited, greed rules, the game is rigged against average people. Socialism at that time, was a viable alternative. Capitalism had failed.",8,1,1,18 August 2018
Bohemian Rhapsody," Really this movie was vg
","When Freddy Mercury came along my music days were pretty much over. I guess he was a major star mid seventies on? I did remember his songs, but did not know who sang them. Given this, I thought BR was a very good movie. Lots of good music, a sad story, ending in an early death from aids. He was a tremendous vital personality and like many celebrities over did the lifestyle. Of course the gay community didnt know enuf about the disease in the pre 80's to take precautions. He was probably conflicted about his sexuality somewhat.That was a transition era.
I have not been to the movies in years because the recent productions have pretty much been crap. We decided to see BR while waiting for the election results to roll on in the US midterms. The previews of coming attractions before this movie were almost laughably bad. So the trend continues. !!!! A couple of Q band members were around to help recreate the situations. I have no idea how realistic this movie was, how egocentric FM was, or if he even had a career when Queen broke up. It seemed like he went back because he realized he needed them . Without them he was lost ?? He was a tremendous innovative performer as were his bandmates.
His performance, I watched the real one on youtube, at LiveAid was top notch.
The actors in this movie were well casted. They are almost dead ringers for his real band members. FMs lookalike Malek? seems perfect as far as FMS stage antics .The crowd scenes at the concerts seemd rather muddy and are probably CG created. I really dont see anything else one can criticize about this flic. Both my wife and I enjoyed it alot.",9,1,3,7 November 2018
Doctor Zhivago," Epic sweeping historic and could have been tighter.
","This movie is in the old epic David Lean style. Lush sets, huge panoramic shots, epic making historic events. It is fundamentally a love story formed by a lost war, regime change, changing society and of course revolution. DrZ prepares for a conventional life but historic events and an encounter with Lara change his life. His wife was wonderful but his passion is reserved for L. Russia is a gigantic country with a huge presence on the world stage. England, Germany, France, Russia, had the greatest influence in the west on the twentieth century. The US was not as important until after WW2. It is a pity that Russia did not create its own version of this story..Complaints that the actors are more English than Russian are odd since I think the book was banned in the USSR. I have no idea how real Russian actors would make a difference. A non Russian viewer probably does not know the basic facts of Russias history, revolution, or pre revolution society. Every couple of years I rewatch this movie . I like the scenery, history, geography, and climates influence on these events. Coming from a cold climate I understand how that would play a huge part in daily life and events. Russia is a fascinating country and its revolution was long overdue when it happened.That society needed to change and the outcome modernized the country at a
huge costto the Russian people.",8,2,4,21 December 2018
The Favourite," Kind of slow moving overhyped.
","The costumes in this movie are great.The pacing is slow and repetitive. The theme is similar to Vice where a lazy ,uninterested, dumb leader has power taken by ambitious underlings.
I saw this in a theatre with closed captions on the screen. It would be necessary I think to understand the dialogue. I dont think they said Okay in that era. A quick poll gave this movie a 5 and no more.Historic accuracy Nah!!! Probably not. Queen Anne only ruled 5 years. The movie seems to go on much longer. Boring 'Hollywood' story based on fact (yes these 3 people existed)very overhyped. The Lesbo angle is overdone. Did I mention that Queen Anne was happily married and miscarried 15-17 times?",5,1,4,2 January 2019
Django Unchained," Ridiculous.
","Its like a Richard Roundtree movie transported to the West. Simplistic stereotypes. Ridiculous situations are not comedy. I tried watching this and just could not stomach it. Tarantinos little cameo was just silly. My view of Ts films was not improved by this. Targeted movies like this are beyond the pale. Its done for cynical reasons and they know critics will not criticize them. I like westerns and I hated this one. I admit I didnot, could not ,watch this whole film.",4,1,7,13 November 2018
The Man Who Would Be King," A fine film but a definite racist element?
","Two near do wells sally forth to steal a kingdom for themselves. Setting modern technology against primitive natives they actually succeed. In afar off remote kingdom they are mistakenly recognized as godlike- the son of Alexander the Great. A Masonic connection makes them holy. All the native peoples bow down before the false white gods. This is set in the period when the sun never set on the British Empire. In this case the Gods were Englishmen. They even have a jolly brown accomplice, Billy Fish. This whole idea is racist. Afghanistan -Kafiristan is the setting for this movie. Probably the only reference to Afghan. I have ever seen before .
Its a well filmed movie with great location shots,amusing quippy dialogue,with the two accomplices Cain and Connery. It seems to work on many levels. The ancient looking fort towns look like something from the bible.
Best quote ' With proper training you can
slaughter your enemies like civilized men. '
Maybe Houston and the story are somewhat dated as the BE days seem a long time ago.",3,0,11,22 December 2018
Snowden," mediocre
","An incredibly important story some of which I already knew. The movie itself was frankly boring. My self and spouse both dozed off during it.The Snowden character was completely featureless,flat,boring,and frankly weird. His girlfriend was equally vapid.I believe she was a pole dancing instructor....!!!???? I would say this was truly mediocre. Obviously this was targeted for a younger techie date oriented audience. All the evil characters were old and the younger ones good??No wonder movie attendance is down. Oliver Stone must be be slipping. Or maybe computer spying is just not that interestin and thus making a riveting movie is much harder..",5,22,56,20 September 2016
The Departed," Excellent Boston based story.
","Loosely based on the Whitey Bulger? story this is a Boston based epic. The Godfather was a NY story and of course on a bigger scale. Boston is a smaller place and its old Irish ethnic neighborhood of South Boston is the setting for this gem. The statehouse sits shining on its hill and the
state govt. is riddled with corruption. Whitey Bulger survived and flourished for years as a gang head and was an FBI snitch. He worked with a FBI agent who was born in his home neighborhood. This agent eventually was convicted on corruption charges and went to prison. Whitey mostly gave info about th local Mafia and several convictions came from this. The Mafia ran Boston from Providence RI and its 'offices' were located on Federal Hill. Bulgers brother was the Speaker of the Mass. State House and later the head of the University of Mass. !!! Whitey was a fugitive for many years, was caught and convicted only to be murdered in prison. Probably for being a rat.
This movie has several stories going at once. Undercover police, Corrupt police, honest police, gangsters both Irish and Italian. Local color and Catholic religion role in the area. You have a heavy duty cast here with several important character roles by Sheen,Baldwin, Wahlberg and others. Dicaprio is huge in this and Nicholson is excellent. They dominate the screen. Matt Damon is very bean town but is just not in the same class. For me he lacks something in his roles. He is a major star but of a lesser magnitude of presence. I found the music in this to be overdone and somewhat distracting. My wife felt it was a very good, intense,tension filled movie. She thought the ending was weak, unlikable, not up to par??? At least the corrupt ones got what was coming to them and that does not always happen in reality.",9,0,1,27 December 2018
