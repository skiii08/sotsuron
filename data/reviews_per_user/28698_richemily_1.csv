Requiem for a Dream," Shock Tactics that mean nothing
","Yes this film does leave you in 'shock and awe' at the end and you could be fooled into thinking you have just seen a great movie. However, when you've had time to rationalise things it is obvious this film is an empty shell of tradegy which the root is caused by 'evil drugs'. There have been comments that this film is 'extremely realistic'  and 'what drugs do to you'. These statements are ridiculous to the majority of people who live in the real world. This film shows the almost comi-tradegy spiral of 4 people into a 'drug hell' which could have been taken straight out of a government 50's educational film. It lacked sensitivity, reason and any notion of reality, an absolute joke of a film.",Null,5,8,7 September 2003
