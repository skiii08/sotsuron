Skyfall," The WORST Bond film of all time
","I won't rehash some of the very poignant observations that many of you have made. I am astounded that the critics had any positive reviews of this atrocious film. The take home point is that if you want to make movie critics happy,add some Freudian element that make the film's characters appear to have depth. Similarly, you can add a background story to a well-known character (who needs no background story).The film is a complete mish-mash of half-realized ideas and stolen story elements from other movies. I was not hugely fond of the first two Daniel Craig vehicles. Not because they were bad movies, but because they could not decide what direction they wanted to go with the Bond character. Did they want to make him more like Jason Bourne, like John McClain, like any of a half-dozen action movie or espionage protagonists who were NOT Bond?In this film they decided to rip the very heart out of Bond and replace him with a psyche. It does not work. Does Bond save anyone or anything in this film? No! He lets 'good' or 'neutral' characters who are within his power to save, die. And for no other reason than he doesn't care. I was offended at how Bond lets people die in front of him (some pretty significant characters as well) without so much as a care. He has no passion. No drive. No motivation whatsoever, except for a very contrived (and kind-of spooky / gross) Freudian love affair with M. Yuck!!! He is NOT Bond! And the villain is a carefully constructed anti-hero. His mother-complex makes him homosexual. Oh, how sophisticated is that thinking? Mendes, you really stink!! The plot is otherwise a complete disaster. Let's steal from Mission Impossible (the first movie version) and do it badly. Let's steal from the Dark Knight, from earlier Bond films, and do them all incredibly badly! What did I learn from 'Skyfall?' Critics can be bought. A franchise can be destroyed and we, like sheep, will pay for it.To put it simple, colloquially,(and more intelligently than this film does); this movie SUCKED BEYOND ALL POSSIBLE SUCKINESS! If you doubt me, shell out the cash and see it. It will be some of the most intolerable 2 hours and 25 minutes you have ever spent. I",1,22,40,12 November 2012
