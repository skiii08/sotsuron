The King's Speech," Fantastic
","I love this period of the 20th century and this movie does not let history down. A must see with parts that brings tears to ones eye with that passionate speech at the end. A brilliant speech in its own right, and with the passions of someone, of people not with the King's best interest wanted to see fail, overcame all the adversity and stood up proud and strong and gave a speech that moved England's troops in the dark days of WW2.This Monarch is one of a kind who overcame his issues to put Hitler in his place; history records the rest. I tend to think had this Monarch not stood up to the plate, England's Monarchy might not have been the only thing ruined. In hind sight the commonwealth is better for the world at large but these were testy times and this movie does history proud service to this era. Great movie I will see it again.",10,7,14,18 December 2010
Argo," Mr Affleck......................................................
","I am about to cry now, this was one of the best films I have seen in years. Not only that this was a true movie, but really now Mr. Affleck you deserve the Nobel Peace prize as far as I am concerned. I can only imagine how the six people feel right today alive in our midst. This was more then a monumental task of putting something like this together KUDOS to the man and the everyone who made the moral decision to save American lives and with such selfless love of life.His reuniting with his family, I almost lost it.WELLLLLLL DONE is all I can add, very well done and am proud to be an American today who got to see this fine movie. Any Spoilers, you need to get a life.",10,0,3,27 September 2013
