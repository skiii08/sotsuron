The Blair Witch Project," One of the worst movies I have ever seen!!
","The Blair Witch project was the first movie (but not the last) to severely disappoint me when critics proclaimed it the 'scariest movie ever.'I suppose my main problem with it is that so many of the characters' choices defied logic.The two I thought were absolutely horrific were the decision to go back a different way than where they came and the decision to go back in the woods when they came across the river the second time.Anyone with even a basic knowledge of wilderness survival(which Heather if no one else was supposed to have) knows that if you're in unfamiliar territory you don't use a different path from the one that took you in. Also, they would know that if you find a river, follow it and you will eventually be led back to civilization(plus you'd have water if you're stuck for more than a day or two).Now I know there is supposed to be a degree of suspension of disbelief in movies, but when the movie is presented like a documentary that degree is decreased dramatically.In conclusion, the stupidity of the characters and the lack of any real 'jump moments' until the last ten minutes is what ruined this movie for me.",1,1,3,27 February 2004
