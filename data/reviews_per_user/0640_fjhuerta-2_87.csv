The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," After a surprising Part I and II, we get The Bore Games
","Most people have already said what is wrong with this movie. But I'll just add - NOTHING happens during the movie. Nothing. I was expecting SOMETHING, anything - all I got was hesitation and doubt from every single character.That, and the fact that the main character (Katniss) looked scared 100% of the time. She had a single facial expression: OMG. No smiles, no strength, no nothing. For a movie that is supposed to set her up as a hero, this is a disaster. All I could think of what 'JEEZ, I get it! You are troubled! MOVE ON!!!'.Terrible. Should have listened to my friends, who said just to skip this one and read the books.",3,5,8,14 June 2015
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Worst movie I've seen in my entire life. Period.
","Why?When I was 3 years old, I had the immense privilege of attending a real cinema. To watch 'Star Wars'. I might have seen a lot of movies before (the Disney classics), but one thing is for certain: I don't remember anything about them. But I remember where I went to see Star Wars. I remember the little space ships hanging from the ceiling. I remember standing in line for hours. And being amazed by this story which I was not yet old enough to understand. The same rush happens when I watch Star Wars at home today. I certainly believe I have seen that movie more than 100 times in my lifetime; and I think that it is and will be my favorite movie forever.Sadly, I only saw 'Phantom Menace' once. I did buy the videocassette (VHS in these days of DVD? Give me a break, Lucas!), and never watched it. The movie is just too boring, too slow, too dumb, too vain to be called Star Wars. I waited to see this movie for a long time. I actually went to the 3:00 AM screening the day it came out. And, oh boy, what a disappointment it was.I don't know where to start. The first one had Luke, the naive but likeable hero; Princess Leia, a nice (not gorgeous, but nice) leading lady; Han Solo, played to perfection by Harrison Ford, and the granddaddy of all baddies, the one and only Darth Vader. The new one has an irritating kid that can only yell 'Yippie!' every now and then, a princess who cannot move due to her customes, a lifeless Obi-Wan, who spends most of the time looking worried and speechless, a boring Qui-whatever (Liam Neeson in Star Wars?!?!), and the worst character ever to grace a movie screen: Jar Jar Binks. Makes me think the Ewoks deserved an Oscar for Best Performance. Even the bad guy looks like a circus clown with nice moves. Please!!!The magic is gone. I sure wish Lucas packed his bags and went home to develop a new THX system, or to give more money to his special effects team. Those are his strengths. But his weaknesses (poor storytelling, dumb plot as full of holes as a swiss cheese and wooden acting) show up all through this boring and lifeless movie.The only thing that saves it is the Pod race. And watching Jabba the Hut. Other than that, it's the worst movie I have ever seen in my life, just because it dared to call itself 'Star Wars'. Maybe if it had gotten any other title, I would have been more benevolent (Howard the Duck II, perhaps? =)Caveat emptor.",4,1,2,6 June 2000
Meet the Parents," I've seen this before...
","In real life. There is something about Meet the Parents that usually leaves you thinking 'I've lived through this before'. Everyone I saw this with could relate at one point or another with Greg, which made the humor so effective. You get to care so much about the main character because you actually feel you could have been at one time or another him.I? Well, a parent of an ex-girlfriend of mine was a criminologist. You can imagine how hard I laughed during the 'interrogation' scene.
If you have ever dated someone, you owe to yourself to watch this movie. It's hilarious, and Robert de Niro and Ben Stiller won't disappoint you. What a chemistry!",6,0,0,4 March 2001
Akira," Great visuals, bad plot (remember Battlefield Earth?)
","((Warning: MILD spoilers ahead))The good:* Very nice animation, although it sometimes seems choppy and other times it is as detailed as a Saturday morning cartoon. I wonder if there was more than one team working on this movie, since the animation quality is not consistent.* Special effects. The streaking lights on the motorbikes are superb, and they compliment the action nicely.* 5.1 / THX soundtrack. In DVD format, this movie has terrific sound and video quality.The bad:* Forget about understanding the plot if you never read the comic.* Editing is terrible. Imagine a cartoon version of Battlefield Earth (minus the dorky angles, terrible acting, and blandness). It all adds up to a confusing mess of a movie.* The pacing is bad. The first half of the movie goes by pretty quickly. The second half is boring and confusing.The ugly:* What's up with the scenes where a 15 year old has her clothes ripped off and she is clobbered viciously? Isn't this illegal? Bad taste... really bad taste.* Vices galore. Drinking, drug abuse, and violence. I thought these were only Hollywood traits.* The level of aggresivity in this movie is way high. Way too high. It makes Fight Club seem tame in comparison. We get the idea on the first motorcycle scene; so why emphasize it over and over again during the entire picture? Is this a trick to make us believe the movie is great, when in reality it is just violent?The verdict: you might have to watch it once, since it is really interesting (much more than the overrated Ghost in the Shell), but it is ultimately confusing, a bit boring, and unfulfilling. It's one of those movies you come out with a feeling of emptiness you didn't have in the first place.",4,9,20,23 September 2001
The Birth of a Nation," Unbearably painful to watch; a disgrace.
","How do we measure the worth of a movie?Do we take its technical brilliance into consideration? Or shall we value it because of its moral lesson? Maybe it is just its entertainment value?And how shall we rate a tecnically perfect movie, which just happens to be the most racially offensive movie ever made?Those are the questions I have right now in my mind. For I wasn't ready to watch this disgrace of a movie, and I still cannot fathom the anger and rage it caused. No, I am not an african american, nor a descendant of one. I am not an U.S. citizen, either. But it enrages me to watch it, for the sole reason that it is a display of racism and hatred for the masses.If you watch this movie, not knowing anything about racial conflicts, you might end up thinking that black americans are faithful and obedient when servants, despotic and lawless when in command, and all the while with just enough intelligence to survive. In fact, the leading black players are actually white people in disguise. There are mentions of an 'heroic' Ku Klux Klan, perpetually outnumbered by the hordes of african americans, and suffering from the worst of humilliations. The black slaves are noble beings, defending their white masters against the other black people. The black people in congress are simple minded, arrogant, badly dressed, with no manners or education whatsoever.If you are beginning to equate this film with the Nazi propaganda machine of the 1930's, then this review won't be in vain.Many people would like to believe that we should leave the past behind. That this film should be remembered by its artistic and technological brilliance, and not by the racial hatred it inspired. I say these people are the same that still proclaim the white (aryan, as it is known throughout the film -more Nazi references) race as superior, and that, deep within themselves, still hate and fear the black race.And thus, we risk in repeating the past ourselves. It's a shame this film has a 7.4 grade. I am a believer in freedom of speech, but people should know better than praise this pathetic, racist piece of garbage.",5,5,12,16 July 2001
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," Mind blown. I thought I'd never experience Star Wars this way again since 1977
","...when I was 3 years old.This movie had me literally at the edge of my seat, hands sweaty. I couldn't stop staring at the screen. I felt I was, once again, piloting an X-Wing. I felt the excitement I thought I'd never feel again. I felt fear when the most famous bad**s of all time was back. I was exhilarated. I cried. I cheered. I had a new hope at the end of it all.This is what the prequels should have been, instead of the garbage Lucas dumped on us. This is what we deserved all along. This is Star Wars, all grown up. And it's better than it ever was.I'd consider this as good as Star Wars; better than every other movie, and quite frankly, far better than I could have ever expected.Thanks Disney. You have definitely saved the franchise.",10,6,13,21 December 2016
Captain Corelli's Mandolin," Too long, too slow, too predictable. Not believable.
","First, the good points.<ul><li>The photography is superb. Greece never looked this good. - Penelope Cruz. She is pretty, although nothing special.</li></ul>Now, the bad points.<ul><li>This film shows a total lack of respect for italian soldiers. If we were to believe what was depicted, those men were irresponsible drunks who would rather run away than defend their country. Also, germans are portrayed as lying weasels, not worthy of any trust. </li></ul><ul><li>The storyline is simply not believable. It requires far too much reality stretching. For example, the italian soldiers are never into any trouble with the locals; it seems that they are not at war, but rather in some sort of vacation. Another good example: the german soliders order the italians to surrender their weapons; after a small fight, the italians prepare an attack that same night. While the germans were in town. Didn't anybody notice the huge cannons and mortars being loaded? Also, the scene where Corelli is shot at with dozens of automatic weapons. Another soldier protects him with his body, and he is saved. Next day, he is up and running as if nothing had happened. Too unbelievable.</li></ul><ul><li>The continuity of the film suffers greatly because of the director's obsession with Nicholas Cage's eyes and Penélope Cruz' talent (?). There are various scenes that only show Cage for what seems like an eternity, and another where Cruz appears dancing. She is graceless, mixing Flamenco and Tango during the scene. And it drags too long. The entire movie is too long.</li></ul>Overall: too long, too pretentious, too unbelievable, and finally, too boring. It could have been a lot better.",2,2,4,4 November 2001
12 Monkeys," Good, dark movie
","This is a really good, underrated movie. I felt it was very similar in many respects to David Fincher's works (specially Fight Club): although the theme in itself is not even similar, both share gloomy visions of our future because of our present. Even more, both films look as if they had been purposely treated to look incredibly ugly on screen (which, btw, is not a bad thing when you consider the plot).The plot? Well, humanity was wiped off the surface of the earth, and doomed to live underground. Before you start harvesting thoughts of 'Battlefield Earth', STOP! The plot is just an excuse for an incredibly complex story, which, if you are not paying attention, might not be clear to you the first time you watch the film. As a matter of fact, watching the film twice, or three times, will demonstrate all the possibilities of the story (which are many, and all powerful).I might be wrong, but I think this film was also Bruce Willis' first 'serious' movie. He is the 'hero' (if the word fits his persona) of the movie. Paired with Brad Pitt, in a stunning role as a psychotic man, both guys deliver quite a performance. Pitt, in particular, avoids the 'pretty boy' persona he seemed to have cultivated up to that point, and delivered a stunning rendition of a mad mastermind. He might be called the 'villain' of the movie. He is, but *not quite*. Everything in this picture, actually, is *not quite* it seems.Add to this a very good surround mix, and you have yourself a winner, what might have been the most underrated film of 1995.",8,0,0,10 May 2001
Beauty and the Beast," Strangely touching
","There was a time when Walt Disney could no no wrong. But then came DuckTales and stuff like that. And things were in turmoil for a while. Seriously, how many people watched 'Oliver and Company'? I know I didn't, and I have watched every single animated feature of the company (except that one).That's the reason Beauty and the Beast is such a welcome surprise. This film, and 'Lion King' are true masterpieces. I cannot say the same about Tarzan, or 'Hunchback of Notre Dame' or 'Aladdin'. But there is something in this film that makes me cry every single time I watch it.What could it be? Maybe that, since the beginning, you learn to care for the Beast and his loneliness. Or you admire Belle for her will to be something more. And you cannot forget the sadness of the inhabitants of the castle, who know that they might be doomed forever.And then... and then Belle and the Beast dance in the ballroom sequence, and they glance at each other, and you can feel the love they have for each other. But how? This is only a cartoon, isn't it? Fact is, the drawings themselves have an incredible power in them; the facial expressions are simply perfect, and the terse, beautiful song enhances the feeling. Movie magic at its best. Beauty and the Beast is a cartoon that makes you forget you are watching one. It's full of love, passion and drama. Should have been nominated for Best Picture. Sadly, the Academy hasn't (yet!) learned to appreciate the power of animated art.",10,0,0,9 June 2000
Madagascar," Forgettable. But...
","It's kinda nice to see things the other way around - we are nice to animals in the zoo, while they can be eaten in the jungle.Simplistic? Yeah, quite. But it's also quite refreshing. I can imagine PETA going crazy over some of this movie dialog, which gets it an extra point or two.Other than that... blah. Ben Stiller is kinda boring here. Same thing with Chris Rock. I'm surprised about it - I'd have thought they'd have the same level of energy Spade had in 'The Emperor's New Groove'. The story is as flat as a coke left open in the desert for 6 weeks - I can't even begin to understand who would have thought a pilot episode for a Saturday morning cartoon could make it into a full length movie.But... but... you have to love those penguins. I know I did. Penguins are my new heroes.",5,0,1,28 July 2005
Batman Returns," Tim Burton returns!
","Excellent movie! Second only to the first one, it has a degree of lunacy matched only by 'Mars Attacks!' also by Tim Burton.Many people feel that this is not as good as the first one mainly because of the lack of a character as powerful as The Joker. Although this might be right, IMHO it only makes this movie a different mix of values than the first one. It has the trademark darkness and psychological paradigms of the first one, but with a slightly sick twist: human oddities play a powerful role in the movie. The last of the 'real' Batman movies, it is a must see for the sewer scenes and the 'flight' over the abandoned zoo. A great movie by any standard.",9,0,0,13 August 2000
Finding Nemo," Absolutely stunning
","How many movies can you think about that:1) Have you laughing *before* the main feature starts ('The Incredibles' trailer, the 'Snow Man' short film).2) Keep you glued to your seat, just watching the incredible beauty of it all.3) Make half of the entire theater *stay* during the credits, just to watch the main characters swim back and forth and be generally cute, while being completely quiet.4) End up with all of the people leaving the movie theatre with a huge, sincere, honest and childish grin in their faces?Not many, I'm sure. Pixar's 'Finding Nemo' is all that, and more. A true family movie, a true 'buddy' movie, a  true 'kids' movie; a hugely entertaining and sincere film. Once again, John Lasseter and company play with your emotions, raise up questions to be answered, manage to deliver a deliciously complex, thought-provoking movie, all while entertaining kids from 1 to 12 years old, and making everyone else laugh and *think* throughout it all.I don't know what or how Pixar manages to deliver such beautiful, enjoyable gems with such regularity. All I know is, the little studio that could will be remembered for a long time for making the only movies that have a heart and soul buried deep within bits and bytes. Best movie of the year. By far.",9,0,0,6 July 2003
Dead Poets Society," A powerful antidote to conformism
","There are certain films that get under your skin, never to come out. They change your life, subtly altering your perceptions of reality, almost always for the better.Dead Poets Society is one of those few films.I saw the movie back when I was in High School. I had a teacher who told us that we really needed to watch it; in fact, it was our 'homework' for the day. We didn't need to bring back a report, or talk about it in class. All he asked from us was to watch it, make up our own mind about it, and that was it. As you can imagine, many friends of mine didn't watch it at all; I did. And yes, I feel I changed a bit from there on.Back when you are young, you never really stop to think what in the world you are doing with your life. You simply live for the day, hope your grades will be enough to pass, and that's it. Long term thinking involves maybe flirting with a girl. Nothing more. What this film showed me was that we have the responsability and the joy of being alive in this planet. That we are dust, and we will go back to it, so we have precious little time to make a difference. That we have a moral obligation to 'seize the day, and make our lives extraordinary' (my favorite quote in all movie history). That the world, basically is ours. That the only limitations are within ourselves, and that we owe it to us to fight, to rebel against conformity, to change what we hate and keep what we love. That living in this world is a beautiful responsability, and that only cowards dare not to change it for the better.The fact that the cast was basically my age, and was passing through the same dilemmas and situations I was facing made it all so much more powerful.So here I sit, 12 years from that day. I still don't think I have seized the day completely. But I keep on trying; I always will. I wonder how many people were transformed by this gem of a movie; I hope many.10 out of 10. A definitive masterpiece.",10,780,818,22 August 2001
Ed Wood," Just a man, and his love for movie-making
","As a B-movie lover, I was attracted to Plan 9 from Outer Space because of it being called the worst movie of all time, and Ed Wood as the worst director of all time. If I remember correctly.This approach to Ed Wood was wrong, apparently. This movie sure made me reconsider a lot of things about the man and his artistic vision.Surely enough - he was a pretty incompetent director. His movies are proof of that. Yet - once I watched Glen or Glenda, I began wondering whether I had misjudged the man and his output. Mainly because the love for his craft was perfectly obvious, in spite of all of his technical mistakes.Leave it to Tim Burton to tell the story about a misfit, surrounded by misfits, who is trying to make a sense of a world that can't understand him at all. Burton's love for movie-making is reflected on Ed Wood's love for movie-making - and it results in an extremely uplifting movie, which makes anyone reconsider their previous stance on Wood. No longer is he the laughingstock of Hollywood - he is, thanks to Johnny Depp, a real human being, with real feelings, fighting for a chance to make his dreams come true.I never saw Ed Wood the same way after this movie - now, whenever I watch Plan 9 or Glen or Glenda I enjoy it in a different way. No longer do I believe they are the worst movies ever made; far from it. I'm willing to believe many other Hollywood 'blockbusters' hold this distinction, if only because the people who made them lost their respect and love for the movie-making art.Thanks, Mr. Burton, for setting the record straight.",9,0,0,17 December 2008
Chicken Run," This shouldn't be funny
","This movie is, but shouldn't be, funny. It's a dead-ringer for a Nazi concentration camp in WWII, with executions, mass murders, cruelty and hope. It is funny because the creators tried very (sometimes too) hard to make this a light comedy. But it is not one. I wouldn't take my children to watch this movie; too many questions would arise that needn't be answered at a young age.It's a good movie; the thing is, it is great for adults. Entertaining enough. But for all of you who rave about the animation, I am surprised you have ignored the real masterpiece in plasticine stop motion: The Nightmare Before Christmas. That one is a movie with a heart and a soul of gold. This one is merely good; I think I will forget it in about a week. It doesn't raise enough questions (about life in a concentration camp -er, I mean, a chicken farm) and it fails to answer most of them (why did Rocky return to the farm? Why and how did he escape?). Read the plot outline, and you will guess every part of the movie in sequence.Not bad, definitely. But it could (and should have) been so much better.",6,0,0,10 December 2000
X-Men," Uneven pace, but well made
","* Warning: 2 spoilers in this review *Every summer the same thing happens: a new blockbuster film appears. Sometimes the result is astoundingly good (Batman, Matrix), sometimes it is so bad it's not worth even mentioning it (The Phantom Menace), and sometimes it's a mixed bag. X-Men is that mixed bag.Good points: excellent photography, dark and murky in the mutant fighting scenes, light and airy in the 'human' scenes. Nice special effects, although not in the same league by any measure as those in The Matrix. Also, Anna Paquin's character and acting are the best of the bunch.Bad points: the special effects sometimes actually *detract* from the enjoyment of the film. As an example, Ray Park's fighting scenes are almost non-existant (definite bummer) because his character is always enhanced by SFX in some way or the other. At least in Phantom Menace his lightsaber duels were always visible on screen. In 'X-Men', you get to see him leaping from wall to wall and hanging for dear life with his tongue, but not much more. Also there are some continuity issues throughout the film. For example, in the final sequence *SPOILER AHEAD*, Wolverine´s makeup is uneven, and it really shows. When in the scene with Rogue, he sometimes appears scratched, then healed, then scratched again. But the worst problem with the film is its uneven pace. It starts slow, then tries to catch up only to slow again. *SPOILER AHEAD* When the climax was over, I was wondering whether this was it or if there was any other scene. It wasn´t a climax, really. The action sequences are too few and far between, and it is very difficult for someone who isn't a fan of the X-Men to be interested the whole film. It is simply not compelling enough (if you are not a fan). And this shows also in character development, where you never really get to know the principal characters or their motivations (Wolverine, Charles Xavier, Cyclops, Storm, Toad). Seems like the producers wanted to concentrate on the esthetics of the movie instead of deeper meaning, thinking that fans would already know the basics.
I would have to say a far better example (although similar in many respects, such as photography) of a 'comic book' movie is Tim Burton's Batman. This movie has very, very strong principal characters (Joker and Batman, whose life and tribulations are made known with subtle hints), amazing sets (Gotham City's nightmarish landscape beats New York any time) and a dense, complex plot. I am sure this last opinion will be debated, but only time will tell which is the greatest comic book movie. I can hardly wait.",6,0,0,13 August 2000
Sleepy Hollow," Dark, but sweet
","Another great Tim Burton movie, Sleepy Hollow is a great re-telling of the Ichabod Crane story. This movie, in fact, reminds me strongly of another Halloween feature by Burton: 'The Nightmare Before Christmas'. The main difference here is that, while in 'Nightmare'  there are no villains or heroes, just characters in search of their identity, Sleepy Hollow has a villain, a quirky hero, and lots of action. But they both have something in common: they are sweet, lovable films. There is something about Burton, indeed.Another thing worthy of mention: the cinematography is masterfully executed. How could they capture such a range of hues with such a dim light is beyond me. A great movie. A classic for all coming Halloweens (back to back with 'Nightmare', if possible).",7,0,1,23 September 2001
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," A superb movie. This is what great cinema is made of. Best of the best.
","Best dark comedy I've ever seen? Yes. Absolutely.Best 'anti-war' movie? Probably. It does strike a lot of nerves. It'll make you feel strangely uneasy at the end.Best Peter Sellers' movie? Yes, without a doubt.  Best Kubrick's movie? Yes, indeed.One of my favorite movies? You bet it is.I had heard a lot about M*A*S*H and Dr. Strangelove. From all the comments, it seemed M*A*S*H was the better movie, and Strangelove was the more serious take on war of the bunch. So I watched both over the weekend. My final take? M*A*S*H is a fake, a travesty, an insult for all the people who ever fought a war. It tried to capitalize on the drug craze of the 70's by presenting a bunch of surgeons getting drunk and drugging themselves and having a good time. That's the extent of its 'anti-war' message, I guess: 'make love, not war'.Dr. Strangelove, is, OTOH, a cinematic masterpiece. It presents a series of questions to the viewer in the form of a parody. The fact that nuclear holocaust could start because of a human error, and the very specific and detailed characters who would intervene in it. The powerless president. The crazed general. The alarmed russian president. The obsessed texan pilot. It all comes together perfectly - there's no filler here. From the first shot of the bombers flying to the shocking conclusion, this movie never lets your attention drift and instead keeps on questioning the viewers' sense of right and wrong. And all of this is presented in the form of an hilarious comedy.I'm actually grateful about the comedy aspect of the film, because it makes it all the most impressive that, when the credit rolls, you end up feeling quite nervous and unsettled. This is a film that raises many questions, answers them with the particular point of view of Kubrick, and leaves you to ponder them.Truly, this is a great film. Highly recommended.",9,1,1,8 September 2002
Scary Movie 2," I laughed. I cried. And I agreed, the movie stinks!
","Let me first issue an apology:It's impossible not to watch this film with a couple of simple minded friends, in a full theatre, and not choke on your popcorn with laughter. If you are, say, between 18 and 35, like stupid comedies, are in that special mood, and don't care much about your self image, boy, this is the film for you. I was looking to laugh, and I got a movie in which I couldn't stop laughing. So that means the movie works, right?Well. It's like a chiclet. At first it tastes great, but chew on it hard, and the taste is gone. First of all (the apology has ended, BTW), I am SURE I saw a censored version of the movie, since there was a huge gap between the professors' death and the kids trying to get out of the haunted house. Second (and I cannot stress it enough), how come the directors are so keen in showing us the drug addict as the cool guy? I mean, kids are going to watch this movie one way or the other (rental, anyone?) and I can only imagine what they'll think when they see that the dopey guy even gets the girl at the end. Do we really need a drug-glorifying culture nowadays? Sheesh... I have known friends who regularly use drugs, and they ended up isolated and alienated. Nothing at all what is shown on the films.The story, as it is to be expected, stinks. No continuity, jumps from scene to scene, lots of jokes that simply don't work (the whole skeleton thing is stupid), and way too many counterculture references. Which will only help to date the thing. Which will make future viewing difficult or impossible. Which makes this movie appeal to future generation lessen a lot.Which might not be a bad thing, after all.",5,1,2,29 September 2001
MASH," Was this a comedy? 'Snoozefest' is more like it
","For years, I had heard about M*A*S*H, the movie. M*A*S*H, the series. How great they were. I knew Mad Magazine's parody by heart. I never watched the movie because, quite frankly, I could never find the place. Or the time.I usually get a good idea about what movies are about while reading Mad. In this case, though, I couldn't make heads or tails out of the story. It was as if a different artist had written every panel, so the story was nothing more than an incoherent series of sketches. Pretty much like 'Saturday Night Live': write a lot of sketches, get a one hour show, and hope that at least one is mildly funny.This is what this M*I*S*H*M*A*S*H is all about. It has absolutely no plot whatsoever, it has no comedy value whatsoever, and only a couple (1? 2?) scenes will make you laugh. The rest of it feels like a neverending series of medical operations, weird announcements over the PA, and... well, that's pretty much it.(Spoiler ahead) The storyline, if there is one, has something to do with a pair of surgeons arriving at the 4077 unit. Then they do some stuff completely unrelated to one another (one scene has them playing poker, the next scene has them playing golf, and nothing really important happens inbetween, before or afterwards), they hastily assemble a football team, they drink a lot, they treat some patients, have a good time, then they leave. That's it. Forget about the alleged horrors of war, the stress, the trauma - this is more as if there was a war without bullets being fought in a Club Med in South Florida. If you haven't seen the movie, I'm sorry I spoiled it for you. Actually, there's nothing to spoil - the movie is so completely lacking in plot, the characters so devoid of soul, I'm pretty sure you could spend 2 hours looking at grass grow and you'd be equally fulfilled.(End of spoiler)There's something about 70's comedies that's completely beyond me. Pre-70's comedies are usually fun. Pre-40's comedies are devoid of a plot, but are a complete laugh riot. 80's and beyond comedies are raunchier and funnier. 70's comedies (Animal House, M*A*S*H, Caddyshack) seem to be an uncohesive collection of unrelated activities, where it seems smoking a joint is the world's funniest joke.No, I didn't like it. And I can't understand how it made the IMDB's top 250. It's a completely mediocre film with no redeeming qualities whatsoever.",5,7,12,8 September 2002
Battleship Potemkin," So ahead of its time.
","After reading a biography on the last Russian Tzar (Nicholas II), and his failure to secure the army's support, I decided to give this film a try.I watched it with a completely open mind, not knowing anything about it (except its reputation).These are the things that impressed me the most.1) The shots of battleships, and the soldiers used as extras. More than once I stopped to think 'if this was done in this time and place, 80% of this would have been computer-generated'.2) The Realism  in it. From the maggot-infested meat to the shot of the sailor with his candle and the legend 'Killed for a bowl of soup', this movie makes no concessions to the PC cause (which, thankfully, hadn't been invented yet).3) The slow descent into madness of the Odessa Steps sequence. From the first shot, when the limbless man appears, you get the idea something might be wrong; since the overall shots are composed, though, you end up feeling comfortable in your surroundings. Then an amputee appears, and people start falling in dramatic poses. Still, the shots are composed... until the Cossacks appear into scene, and the incredible shot juxtapositions appear. This scene is easily worth the price of admission.4) The fact that this movie is 100% unadulterated propaganda. Then again, when Rambo fought in Afghanistan he also was having something to do with 'propaganda'; only a different kind.Overall: a film marred by a bit of a slow narrative. Nevertheless, Metropolis, The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari and this movie are perfect examples of inventive, edgy movies that are still remembered for their merits today. They really make modern movies look boring and repetitive.",9,3,5,8 March 2003
Tangled," Thank you, John Lasseter!
","I clearly remember the last time I was excited about a Disney movie. It was 'The Emperor's New Clothes'. My son sort of likes 'Bolt', but I can't stand it. With Pixar around, who wants to see stuff like 'Home on the Range' or 'Chicken Little'? In my eyes, Disney was absolutely defeated by Pixar in every conceivable way.Which is a shame, really, since there are so many great things about Disney - nobody used to be able to tell a story like them, and their hand-drawn visuals do things that CG can't.So, what happens when Lasseter does Disney? Well, 'Tangled'. It rocks. It looks awesome - completely distinct than any Pixar film, with a beauty of its own. The story moves slowly at first, but the set-up is well worth it. There's a moment that will probably take your breath away. It was magic, the kind Disney were masters at. I loved it. While nothing this year was going to be able to beat Toy Story 3 (I mean, why even try?) this is a great 50th film for Disney. They should be proud of themselves. They are definitely back in the game, with a little bit of Pixar magic.",6,2,5,28 November 2010
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," NOT the ending we deserved.
","It's not a terrible, 1/10 movie. It's entertaining. The visuals are terrific. But that's it.The story is terribly rushed. Everything happens and happens and happens. Once you exit the theater, you realize how rushed the movie is. And how many plot holes there are. Everything miraculously happens when it needs to. People land where they need to and find clues immediately. It's like watching a clockwork mechanism. Completely predictable and boring.There is no chemistry between the main characters. You could see how Luke, Han and Leia were a tight unit. These guys.... Not so much.In the end, you realize how this is just all about doing the old fans a service. But bringing back Lando, and copying verbatim several scenes from the old trilogy just won't cut it. We are smarter (and older) than that. So yeah, Disney could definitely do an incredible Marvel universe but they just didn't know what to do with Star Wars. A shame.",5,6,10,21 December 2019
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," It's official. George Lucas is the Ed Wood of our generation.
","((Mild spoilers ahead. Believe me, they won't ruin whatever enjoyment you might get from this 'movie')).Inept editing.Insuffrible dialogue.A corny love story which made me yawn in the theatre, while everyone else laughed at the poor acting.Plot holes as big as the Death Star (spoiler: how come Yoda commanded the Clone Army when he made it very clear no Jedi asked for it?).Jar Jar Binks. It doesn't matter it appeared for 10 minutes.
A 50's dinner. A city when there weren't such in the sequels. A chase aboard a spaceship which resembled a Ferrari Dino or a Porsche Speedster. Spaceships that look like buses. A transport identical to a B2 bomber.
1 1/2 hours wasted on a 'romance' that never, ever had any chemistry in it.Names pulled out from the loony bin ('Dookus'? 'Tyranus'? Lucas, for the love of God, pay someone to create *good* names!)There were few scenes worthy of a summer blockbuster (the Dooku lightsaber fight, the clone army attack, the initial chase). But nothing that can be compared to the simple, effective scenes in the original 'Star Wars' or 'Empire Strikes Back'. Those movies look dated, yet they have a soul. It might be a shallow one, but they are tremendously enjoyable.George Lucas, with his '***pisode II', has demonstrated he is, indeed, the Ed Wood of our generation. The only difference between them is that Lucas had a good idea once, and has been milking for what it's been worth for too long now (remember 'Howard the Duck'?). Lucas has not made one single good movie ever since 'Empire Strikes Back'.No, wait. I actually *enjoyed* 'Plan 9 from Outer Space' a lot more than I 'enjoyed' 'Episode II'. I'd watch 'Plan 9' again. Which is a shame, really. The possibilities were endless with this movie. Sadly, George Lucas insists on giving us 'The Little Lulu' of comic-book serials when we were all expecting something closer to 'X-Men'.A shame, a disgrace, a wasted opportunity. Lucas has to be the most inept director out there right now.",6,1,2,8 July 2002
Corpse Bride," Stunning. Once again.
","I have watched this movie three times now. I still can't shake the feeling off - the same one I had when I watched 'The Nightmare Before Christmas'.Although I enjoyed 'Wallace and Grommit' - a lot - I'm happy to have found this little gem, and I do believe it should have won the Oscar. It simply takes the art of animation to a whole new level, all while carrying on a sweet little story of love, redemption, and forgiveness.Yep, the same feeling I got with Jack, Sally, and the rest of the gang in 'Nightmare'. It's more of the same - only even more beautiful this time, and a bit sweeter, darker, and sadder. 'Nightmare' has a better musical selection (actually, it may be my favorite soundtrack), and the story has become a classic of sorts after all these years. But it'd be impossible to choose which one is better. I'm just happy both exist.Films like this, 'Big Fish', 'Nightmare', make you happy to be alive.10/10.",7,0,1,17 May 2006
"Monsters, Inc."," Polygon characters with more emotion than human actors.
","How do the wizards at Pixar do it? How can they?That's the only thing I could think about when I watched 'Monsters, Inc.' yesterday. And realized that, no, nothing I had seen there existed. It's a lot easier when watching traditional animation not to get too immersed in the scenes; after all, you are always aware 'this is not here'. But CGI is making tremendous advances every day.Furthermore, it's not only the realistic animation what impresses the most. It's the heart and soul Pixar embed in each and every of its films. Witness 'Shreck', a very good film on its own right, for example. It was a major hit when it was running on theaters, yet it's seldom talked about nowadays. Now, think 'Toy Story 2' or 'Toy Story'. Both were movie milestones, and definitely are destined to be classics in a couple of years (dare I say both are 'instant classics'?). The secret, or reason, is in the powerful dose of humanity Pixar gives each and every one of their creations. They all have so many human traits it's very hard not to end up liking (loving?) them as if they were real. In a sense they are, being perfectly well rounded characters in perfectly recognizable situations. The fears and hopes of human beings are indelibly etched in every character (fear of death, fear of loneliness, fear of failure, etc.), which makes them even dearer to our hearts.From the animated short that's shown at the beginning of the movie (the 'Birds' featurette, a very similar concept to the 'Carnival of the Animals' section of Fantasia 2000... very funny) to  story development, 'Monsters, Inc.' works like a charm all the way, all the time. Steve Buscemi, John Goodman and Billy Crystal are always having a ball, with a tremendous sense of chemistry between them. Couple that with the prettiest, best CGI character I've ever seen (Boo), and you have a group of superb people playing their parts perfectly well, in a story that is funny, very sweet, and that will leave you filled with love and laughter.
Still... I think this movie comes *this* close to being another Toy Story 2. It's not that it is a bad movie; it's just that TS2 is a landmark; not only the best CGI movie ever, but one of the best movies ever made, period. TS2 most enduring quality is that, to a certain degree, it can soften the most hardened soul with its sweet, beautiful message, while 'Monsters' is a bit less complex in its underlying theme. The fact that it managed to retain so much humanity throughout it, though, is a testament that the wizards at Pixar still have that magic touch that eludes so many famous 'live actors'.I want more.",9,1,2,16 December 2001
Bridget Jones's Diary," Mixed feelings
","I found this movie to be good, heartwarming and funny. I couldn't stop laughing at Bridget's misadventures, or feeling bad about her problems in life.But realistic? No.Here we have an incult, compulsive, alcoholic, chain smoker, whom, we are supposed to believe, gets the affection of the most decent, intelligent, witty and educated guy on the whole movie. That is a little bit too much to believe; I can understand the physical attraction part, but no sane man with such qualifications would dare to get romantically involved with a ticking time bomb of a woman. She was a great couple to Hugh Grant's character: both were basically airheads, only caring about love and sex in the most basic of ways. In fact, being harsh to Bridget's character, even Hugh would have been bored by Bridget's... hmmm... stupidity.Maybe that was too harsh, but I tried to find something, anything of value to Bridget's character. The only thing I found was her desire to find true love. The rest was shockingly bad: she was mediocre, full of vices, dumb, incoherent at times, fat, etc.I think I am looking too much into the movie. Maybe the whole thing was an exaggeration on loneliness and the failure of a human to find a partner in this time and age. If so, then this film is simply superb. If it is meant as an accurate depiction, then I don't think it's as good.Last, but not least, the minute I saw Renee, I was shocked. Was she the same woman that appeared as a sex symbol in 'Me, Myself and Irene'? She looks *terrible*. I wonder if she gained weight in order to appear in this movie (I don't think any woman alive would do that), or if she got the part because of her figure. Terrible.",5,1,2,26 August 2001

","Because, as you know, you didn't answer ANY of the questions raised on Matrix I or Reloaded.We all know about it now. Revolutions is your joke. You did this movie in order to show us all how gullible people can be - that, if a movie had your signature in it, people would flock to it and call it the best movie of all time, even if it was a catastrophic disaster.I laughed a lot! Your theory is right!Now, can you give us the REAL Matrix Revolutions, please?

Man of Steel," About as terrible as Superman Returns.
","Spoilers ahead.Not even remotely kidding. Not really caring about the comics, all I wanted to watch was a good movie. Something like the Batman reboot. I don't mind if it follows the canon or not, or whatever.I didn't even care if it was Oscar potential. All I asked for is to be entertained.Nope. Didn't happen at all.Sure, the SFX are great. And the new suit is OK, I guess. Other than that... what on earth did I watch? I waited and waited. The first half was slow and boring, but I thought it'd build up to a terrific climax. As many pointed out, I wondered about the plot holes (how did Superman know he had to go north? How did Louis Lane fall in love with Superman? How did he do all the amazing feats of strength while near the ship? Why didn't Superman take the battle outside Metropolis? The list goes on and on), but didn't care that much.What I did care about was - the second half was just explosions and nothing more. Violence, destruction, and that's it. The Avengers was fun because the characters had someone to talk to while mayhem happened around them. Batman was interesting because he had Alfred and the Comissioner around. Superman has.. nothing. All we see are loud crashes everywhere. The action goes by so fast you don't really see a thing.The characters are completely forgettable. Even Laurence Fishburne is a bore.I really can't believe this movie had something to do with Christopher Nolan. Batman begins is leaps and bounds better than this movie. I really wanted to like it, but in the end it's just as forgettable as Superman Returns. And that's a really bad thing.It seems Christopher Reeve will forever be THE Superman, after all.",3,4,8,9 August 2013
Cast Away," Good, but not great
","Tom Hanks is king. That's what I think after watching the movie. His transformation is totally amazing: from a very slightly overweight man to the a very skinny person, from a very hard-working employee to a survivor, Tom Hanks simply amazes me.The crash scene is the most terrifying aircraft footage I've ever seen. The sound effects actually made me feel uncomfortable and nervous. A masterpiece.Wilson was a great idea.Sadly, the rest of the film left a lot of issues unexplored. It should have avoided the 'before' and 'after' story, instead concentrating on Hanks' loneliness at the island. The 'silent' part of the movie was the best for me. I could've cared less about his soon to be wife, or his friends at work. It was pretty obvious how all that would finish. Very cliched.Oh, and if you don't know by now who paid for the movie, watch it. You'll all agree it was FedEx. At one point, I even got to think I was watching an infommercial, where Hanks demonstrated that 'not even being a castaway will stop FedEx from delivering on time!'. Yuck!Solid 8 stars because of Hanks, the crash scene, and Wilson.",4,0,1,1 February 2001
Lilo & Stitch," I gave this movie another chance. I'm glad I did.
","First time, I commented how 'The Emperor's New Groove' was my favorite Disney movie of the last ten years, and how 'Lilo & Stitch' had left me wanting for more.How wrong I was then.I gave it another chance. I went back to watch it with a couple of friends and their sons and daughters. What best atmosphere to enjoy a Disney flick?And then, the scene were Stitch is alone, with 'The Ugly Duckling' book, shouting 'I'm lost!' (or at least that's what he was saying in spanish) made me change my mind. I suddenly became very identified with the main character's quest for belonging, and suddenly realized he was actually everyone I know - searching for approval, trying to be loved, longing for love. The watercolor drawings, the facial expression, the music, the mood - perfection, indeed. There are a couple of animated scenes that convey this kind of mood - the Ballroom Sequence in 'Beauty and the Beast', Simba's dad being killed in 'The Lion King', Jessie's song in 'Toy Story 2' - and this one is one of the best I've ever seen. Such simplicity and beauty is strange to find.When we walked out of the movie, my friend's kids were talking excitedly about the movie, when one of their mothers asked them what they enjoyed most about the movie. And one of the girls exclaimed 'Ohana means family! And your family never forgets or abandons you!' (that's what is said in the spanish version of the movie).Then I suddenly realized we need more movies like this.Solid 9 / 10 for Lilo & Stitch.",8,33,44,29 July 2002
U-571," Mel Brooks does Das Boot
","This movie is another one in a long line of pro-U.S. war films. You know the kind. Those are the films where north american soldiers are the only ones capable of any wit, wisdom, intelligence and courage.Unfortunately, by now the rest of the world is a bit brighter, and we know that, really, Ben Affleck didn't save Great Britain from the Germans. There is an undeniable and deep love and respect for all veterans and U.S. soldiers that lost their lives in Europe during both World Wars from the rest of the world, the kind of respect that only comes from defending an ideal with their lives. It's Hollywood who is keen on destroying those heroes' reputation by making them seem so superior as to be ridiculous.In summary, this film is a parody of the amazing 'Das Boot'. It's quite obvious that the same things will happen in any submarine: depth charges, marine battles, etc. But U-571 makes everything seem sweet: there is no claustrophobia, the crew gets along pretty well, they kill every german in sight, and even a destroyer. Das Boot shows a destroyed boat, terribly strained relationships, a sense of quiet desperation and resignation. Where U-571 plays glorious fanfare, Das Boot counters with powerful silence. Where Das Boot puts grime, U-571 substitutes pretty faces. Where Das Boot has realism, U-571 doesn't.But most insulting of all, where englishmen should have been, U-571 cleverly substitutes them with U.S. soldiers. Oh, the nerve.Bottom line: this movie makes for a great surround sound demo disc, or a nice coaster. Hollywood is still clueless when it comes to making war movies. If a future historian only had U.S. war movies to base history upon, he would decidedly declare the rest of the world sub-human idiots, and the U.S. civilization as a more evolved race.A theory Hollywood debunks quite nicely.",3,387,555,22 July 2001
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," An action flick with a heart
","This film has to be one of the more 'human' action flicks out there. While most of them deal with the issue of good vs. bad, purely and simple, T2 introduces the concept of the villain in the first film being the hero in the second (T-800), while the innocent heroine (Sarah) of the first film transforms herself into the cynical person. All the while, the figure of a child (John) whose life has to be protected at all costs looms large, because this child wants to protect his mother and to befriend the Terminator.All this, and a villain that is absolutely relentless and cold-hearted. As I said before, while most action films are good vs. evil, this film confronts its principal figures with themselves:  John, who doesn't want to acknowledge his destiny as the savior of a future world, and risks his life for his mother; Sarah, who has transformed herself into a psychopath, and has to deal with the fact that her only hope is one of the robots that killed John's father in the first movie, and the Terminator, who tries to learn from his human masters the traits of honesty, love and principles.Who said Cameron's masterpiece was Titanic? =)",7,0,0,12 July 2000
Duck Soup," Anarchy rules!
","I guess I was born some 70 years to late. Maybe more. For I cannot understand how 'comedy' today is defined by movies like 'Big Momma's House' and very few people remember the Marx brothers.Groucho was the king of comedy. He was a terrific performer, with obvious roots in the vaudeville scene (he always did a silly dance in every film). He can throw verbal abuse as fast as anyone I've ever seen. He is witty, talented, intelligent and funny. Very, very funny. Harpo was the musical genious (although I felt bored of him playing the harp in almost every movie). Chico is complete mayhem. Together with Harpo, they are a little comedy troupe. Zeppo... well, I don't know about him. He isn't funny at all, he seems the least talented of the brothers. Maybe they needed a straight man in their team.But mix the four together... the results are dynamite. The plot has been told a lot of times; it doesn't matter anyway, since the plot is the last thing you watch in a Marx brothers movie. You watch the movie for the sheer anarchy that prevails in every scene. And this movie delivers.
Intelligent comedy at its best. Even almost 70 years later, it still makes you laugh. I wonder if people will do the same for 'The Nutty Professor' 5 years from now.Oh. One last thing. Did you ever wonder where Bugs Bunny came from? Change the carrot for a cigar; the 3 whiskers for a painted moustache, the big eyes for round glasses, the big, fluffy ears for fluffy hair... yes. Bugs Bunny is the reincarnation of Groucho Marx.",8,0,0,14 March 2001
Spider-Man," An odd mixture of Burton's 'Batman' and Donner's 'Superman' that works.
","*Mild spoilers ahead*It's not really a surprise, is it? A superhero is a superhero is a superhero, after all.Good thing is, this movie doesn't disappoint on many levels. It's a good movie. An entertaining movie. A nice departure from the moralistic / ultraviolent / depressive superhero movies of the last decade. And it does seem better than 'Superman', but not quite as good as 'Batman', which is a very, very good thing. There are way too many parallels with those two movies, actually. It takes the strong, colorful, happy world of Superman, mixes it with the hero's search for belonging, and in the process makes Peter Parker's everyman character to be immediately identified with the viewer. He's not tall. He's not strong. He's not popular. Yet he wishes so much to be. He's a likeable intelligent, everyday man just looking to make sense out of his life. Then, it takes the dark philosophical conflicts of Batman. He carries a responsability he decided to bring upon himself. He is condemned to live a life he wouldn't have chosen in the first place. Once he finds some inner strength, he has to sacrifice his personal life for the good of others. That, the dark alley scenes, and, of course, the balloon parade (a scene which is lifted intact from Batman, except that now the scene is filmed in broad daylight - the parade, the ballons exploding, the aerial chase shootout). Curiously enough, this scene also features some shoots eerily similar to Louise Lane falling from the helicopter - except now, it's M.J. about to fall from a balcony.There is a lesson in here for George Lucas, if he can swallow his pride for once. The lesson is, people like movies about everyday men leading extraordinary lives. Han Solo, Luke Skywalker, Peter Parker, Bruce Wayne, Clark Kent, Neo, 'Jack' - they were all ordinary men who happened to be in the right place at the right time. And they all had a jolly good time with it. As such, Spider-man is a very good, entertaining film which takes its cues from 2 excellent superhero movies. Hey, imitation is the most sincere form of flattery, right?",7,0,0,19 May 2002
The Exorcist," Great movie, except for...
","Chris MacNeil. Oh, what terrible acting. She spent the entire movie screaming and cursing and cursing and screaming. She made me want to turn the whole thing off. I simply couldn't stand her. Although her motivation was surely driving her histrionics, she should have tried to go for a little more restraint. If I had been the Exorcist, I might have tried starting exorcising her instead of Linda Blair. With a little luck, I might have been able to exorcise her out of the movie. Incredibly bad acting.The rest of the movie is an amazing work of art, though. 10 stars to it, -1 for MacNeil, a solid 9 rating.",8,1,2,6 August 2000

","This movie is all about style. Yet it manages to have some plot, too.From the setting (the Bellagio Hotel), right to Brad Pitt's shirts and ties, the movie screams 'classy'. It's just that. A good, very classy film, in which the villain (George Clooney) is as sharply dressed as the 'not so villain' (Andy Garcia). Where every shot is picture perfect, where all shines and sparkles, and where everything is just picture perfect. So perfect, as a matter of fact, it's incredible (which might be the only flaw on the film).Great dialogue lines, a fantastic setting, a terrific cast, an entertaining storyline - how can you miss? Terrific movie.",7,0,1,21 July 2002
Spirited Away," Ugh. Is it just me or did this film make no sense at all?
","I might have a thing with anime. I have never understood / appreciated it. Ghost in the Shell, Akira, and now this movie... I can't seem to like it.As a matter of fact, I find the movies visually stunning - for a framed portrait, that is. Try to make the elements move, and you are greeted with the worst animation since 'Speed Racer'. It's a jarring thing, watching smooth CGI against badly animated characters and elements. That's something I'm willing to ignore - IF the story is compelling, that is.Akira and this movie (and Ghost, to a lesser extent) share a terrible characteristic: they both can't make themselves tell a story with any consistency whatsoever. As in Akira, where the filmmakers were unsuccesful trying to tell a multi-volume story in 2+ hours, it seems Spirited Away tries to hard to tell a deep story - one that has so many dead ends you end up thinking either every small story is a metaphor about something the filmmakers didn't feel the need to tell you, or that this movie is just a collection of beautiful sketches.As an example - why did Sen parents were turned into pigs? And why was she able to find them at the end of the movie? Why didn't she try earlier to do so? Why did Haku try to attack Sen? What was the importance of Sen knowing Haku from before? Why did Sen thought it was a good idea to return the seal to the witch' sister? And why was No-Face introduced as a character when he didn't add anything to the story? and...Maybe it's just me, and the story does make sense once you think of it, or get to know the rest of the directors' output. As it is, I find it hard to understand just what the movie was all about. Which is sad, since, in a way, I was really expecting to like this movie.",4,10,25,15 June 2003
Pearl Harbor," Get a decent DJ... and remix this! Please!
","Warning: mild spoilers ahead.First (I truly have to let this out of my chest):As a non-american viewer, I felt actually insulted (even if I am not japanese) by some parts of this movie. The patriotism clichés (a torn flag floating in the water, the speeches by an englishman telling the north american that the U.S. could take any country in the world with such men, et cetera) are terrible for a summer blockbuster (at least, ID4 acknowledged the campiness in the President's speech). But the truly terrible part is the depiction of the japanese army. Every soldier or higher ranking man is ugly, short, with terrible hair, etc., while the north american soldiers are perfectly dressed, cute, handsome, etc. Still, since Hollywood made this movie, it is only logical that the North Americans must look their best against an ugly, almost deformed enemy. The real problem I see with this movie is that we are presented with Titanic Redux. Throw in a love story with a nice looking guy and girl, plenty of drama, a love triangle, and you have the teen market cornered. Add lots of bullets, and you will surely get men and boys. Then, historical accuracy, and (maybe) you will get the biggest audience possible. Sadly, this movie bombs almost as hard as the torpedos at Pearl Harbour on that fateful day.First, the love story. It is too long, too boring, too clichéd. It even has its 'I am the King of the World' scene (where Danny and the girl go flying). The audience I saw the movie with actually started making noises in protest... and I saw a couple leaving *before* the fighting scenes. They couldn't take it anymore (and neither could I).The love triangle. So predictable, it was boring. It was never gripping enough as to be an integral part of the plot, anyway.The war scenes. Simply incredible. Terrific. Awesome. Not quite 'Saving Private Ryan', but close. Very, very close. Not so gory, not so realistic, but perfectly executed. I can hardly think of anything that could be done to make these precious few minutes better. Historical accuracy: dunno. I'd have to check on that. Still, with so few references to actual events, it is not a movie you'd go to learn about the facts that made Japan attack the US (at the beginning of the film, it is explained that the fuel embargo was the reason for the attack. It seems a very flimsy reason to attack, but that's what was said).
So, what to do with this sad piece of film? Well, the war scenes are so good, I had to raise my final rating from 4 to 7 stars. Think about it. But there could be something that would save the movie. Get a good film editor, cut the love scenes (cut some 2 hours, actually), leave the fight scenes, and film the entire drama behind Pearl Harbor. The real things that happened before and after December 7. Make the film shorter by some 45 minutes, and you will have a knockout of a movie.As it is, oh well. I guess I'll have to wait and see Atlantis, so I can say I watched a great movie this summer.",3,0,0,23 June 2001
Independence Day," A good way to spend a Sunday evening.
","*Warning: Potential spoilers ahead*What about ID4, you say? Well, I think it doesn't deserve the 6 it has averaged at imdb.com. More like an 8. True, it has plot holes the size of New York's own potholes, and no one in his 5 senses would believe Bill Pullman could be President of the United States... or that a virus could be implanted on an alien mothership... and using a Macintosh?!?!?Then again, this movie should be looked at face value: no one said it was factual, possible or even close to reality. It is science fiction, pure and simple. And it excels at that.The movie is amazingly good at making people have a good time. It's simply a movie about good and bad guys, about America and their (or yours, given the case) patriotic feelings. Nothing more than that was implied in the trailer, in the posters or in the advertisment. And it works! The stunning images of the Empire State Building exploding were simply awesome. The CGI planes and alien ships had some terrific battles, similar in concept (although not in the final product) to the trench battle scenes in Star Wars (the real one, not the Fandom Menace). There were enough explosions to satisfy any action flick fan (although my neighbors might think they would have liked the movie more had I turned down a notch -or two- my subwoofer's amp). It's entertainment, and it's very good one. Just don't look for common sense or reality around here. That was not the initial premise. I loved this picture, and I drool over the DVD special edition. You really have to see the original theatrical ending. It would have been a good one.I cannot rate this movie less than an 8, just because I have seen it so many times and it has never failed to entertain.",8,2,4,14 July 2000
Batman Begins," I had basically forgotten there was a time Batman movies were great!
","This is the movie The Hulk wanted to be, and failed miserably - the story of the man that turned himself into a legend. While Hulk failed on every conceivable level, though, this 'Batman' succeeds.Although comparing Burton's Batman to this one is an exercise in tedium (both are great movies, although they satisfy different types of moviegoers), it may be enough to say that, while Keaton portrays Burton's Batman, Christian Bale is the comic book superhero. Keaton has an edge while showing off Bruce Wayne's strange and weird attitude, while Bale is absolutely amazing while depicting Batman as a man, driven by rage and hatred, who is willing to die to find inner peace.The only weakness I could see was Gotham city. Burton's vision of a future / past Metropolis is unsurpassed - his dark, menacing city is oppressive and hopeless. The new city can't approach the old one's power.Strangely enough, I found the actual 'Batman' scenes not as satisfying as the whole Bruce Wayne transformation sequence. And the new Batmobile looks as if Batman has gone SUV-crazy - not a good thing (at least to me). Who cares - this is the Batman we thought we had lost ever since Keaton abandoned his mask.",9,5,6,28 July 2005
Wreck-It Ralph," A movie that really took me back to 1980's....
","These movies... animated movies... are so difficult to rate.Because they all take you places that don't really exist. How do you know it's a good movie when you have no frame of reference? Should you judge them for how they make you feel? Or the worlds they create? Either way - there's so much to enjoy about Wreck-it Ralph I really wouldn't know where to start.It's just so obvious when you love whatever it is that you do. And it's immediately apparent how much love everyone who was involved with the movie have for video games and animation. To say that Ralph's worlds were perfect would be an understatement - they are reinterpretations of the perfection that the original video games already were. There's one reason why Pac-Man, Q*Bert, Street Fighter, etc. are still in our collective consciousness - and that's because they did everything they could with the very limited resources of the time in the best way possible. But watching them, reinterpreted, on the movies is an awesome sight. 'Ralph' shows an entire world where you can lose yourself into, looking for the smallest, tiniest detail you may have just missed.The story is pretty good and fun; the cameos by every video game character are fantastic, the animation is as stunning as anything. It's such a great movie I can hardly believe it comes from Disney, and not Pixar.",9,2,3,30 November 2012
Before Sunset," Surpasses the cinematic excellence of its predecessor. A rare delight.
","This is quite an extraordinary movie. A single, long shot, running in real time, about life, love, regrets and hopes. Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy take their characters and play with them in bittersweet ways - it's the only 'romantic' movie where there's not a single kiss on screen, not a single touch, if I recall correctly; and still, it's so poignant, so melancholic, so sad, so brutal, so real... I can't think of any movie that can come close to the way this one portrays relationships.Jessie and Celine are absolutely real - they are not characters, not actors, they are simply breathing, living persons. They have matured so much since the last time we saw together, and practically every question we as an audience had for them is answered. The way they both gently lead us towards an ending we are somewhat expecting, and then raising even more questions at the end than the first movie is simply brilliant.I sincerely hope Before Midnight is as good as this movie. I'm sure Linklater, Delpy and Hawke will make it happen. This is easily one of the best movies I've ever watched.",10,1,1,29 September 2012
1941," Racist, bigoted, dumb, unfunny.
","From Spielberg's portrayal of 'Japs' (his words, not mine), Germans, Hispanics, etc., to his one sided vision of the war, to his unfunny jokes... this film is an absolute mess from start to finish.Unlike other catastrophes, which are at least somehow tolerable because of how bad they are, Spielberg combines the worst elements he could find, and delivers a movie that can't be enjoyed on any level whatsoever. The plot is non-existent, the main actors, although well known, are stiff, act idiotic, and add nothing to the story, and the film wanders everywhere without any coherence whatsoever.What's the message here? That 'Japs' are stupid? War is funny? Spielberg is the most overrated director ever? I don't know, but really... don't waste your time and avoid this mess. Rent 'Dr. Strangelove' instead.BTW - 2 stars because some shots looked really nice.",2,11,22,21 October 2005
Cars," Once again, Pixar proves it has its heart in the right place
","I wasn't one of those persons who thought a car as a character was a bad idea. Mainly because, well, I love cars. But I did wonder - what kind of story can be told about a car - a story that is engaging enough to compete with stories about cherished toys of our youth, a fish separated from his father, or a cute ant banished from his colony? It turns out I shouldn't have worried at all - because, as always, Pixar didn't do a story specific to a car - it did a story everyone can relate to. Cars are just an excuse to tell it, and have a lot of fun.Years and years after it came out, I'm still enjoying the little details here, there and everywhere a car nut can appreciate. The love for America and cars in general is pretty evident throughout the movie. But, guess what? That really doesn't matter. I think the really important thing here is, once again, Pixar made a story that has more of a human side than many other movies with real life actors.And, once again, the fact that they did it with bits and bytes is nothing short of amazing.9 / 10.",9,0,0,24 November 2008
The Incredibles," Pixar can't do anything wrong, it seems.
","They can't.From amazing story lines, to the most realistic animation available, to the funniest jokes, the best characters... to values, morals...They can't do anything wrong. Every movie they have released so far rates as high as they can in my opinion. 'The Incredibles' is just another incredible movie in their incredible line-up.To compare this movie to stuff such as Shrek is like comparing a Ferrari Dino to a Pontiac Trans-Am. Pixar has a way with things - they usually leave a mark of quality, class, innocence and charm in a way nobody has ever really been able to duplicate.I think what we have here is the rise of a new Walt Disney. John Lasseter is a genius.",9,2,4,28 July 2005
Driven," OMG...
","...this movie is so bad it hurts.((Spoiler ahead)).To give you an idea of how bad this movie is, picture this. Elegant gala reception. A couple of fast F1 cars on display. The main character (don't even remember his name) gets mad at girlfriend, runs away, picks a car, wreaks havoc on the streets (all with corny and badly made computer animation). Our hero, the underdog (Stallone -wait... why is he always casting himself as an underdog, also ran, second place loser nowadays?) chases him, destroying cars and property. Good. They even manage to lift a sewer cover on the process (with computer animation straight out of a Commodore 64). Stallone catches up to his protegée, delivers a rousing speech while police (helicopters, cars, the works) watch. I swear many of them were crying because of the beauty of the moment...And they let them go, simple as that. Next scene is the big race.The whole movie is just one absurd plothole after another. Avoid at any cost.",2,1,2,21 August 2001
I Am Legend," Not the real 'I am Legend'...
","I have to wonder why this movie has the name of a book, if it isn't based on it. Plenty of spoilers ahead...The original 'I am Legend' book (and 'The Last Man on Earth' movie, with Vincent Price, to a lesser extent) is the complete opposite from this film. I suppose Will Smith's ego and Hollywood could never allow a movie where the main character is not a hero (or one in his own mind), but a modern day Dracula (which is what the original Robert Neville really was, and the reason why he became a legend). True; 'The Last Man on Earth' didn't strictly adhere to the original book, either, but it was close enough to make some sense. 'The Omega Man', as awfully dated as it is today (just look at the disco zombies!) at least kept some of the overall feel.But this movie? Nah, it's too busy with Will Smith to be something memorable. While the original movie and book had Robert Neville fighting for survival, killing zombies at day and losing his mind at night, this Robert Neville plays golf, shoots deer, drives fast cars and lives a life of luxury (where did the electricity come from, by the way? At least this question was answered in The Last Man on Earth).While the ending is somewhat similar among the three movies, this one lacks the overall tension of the other ones - these zombies look as if they came out of a video game console. And besides, what kind of tension exists between them and Robert Neville, if Neville never tried to kill them in the first place (as in the book and the other movies?) Even worse - it's explicitly said around 12 million people survived the disease - so, why is Robert Neville supposedly the only man on earth - which is the original premise of the book? Gotta go. I need to watch 'The Last Man on Earth' yet again. Try to find it - it's public domain now!",3,4,6,8 February 2008
School of Rock," I'm surprised... did anyone really like this film? Really?
","After watching this film (and leaving the theater 45 minutes afterward) and watching it again on video (watching the complete thing), all I can say is... 'What can people see in this film that makes it enjoyable?' Sure, Linklater is an amazing director. Jack Black is funny, and has an amazing taste in music. But this movie is a kiddie flick for adult audiences. It misfires every time, all the time. You can't laugh at the kids, since they make kid jokes all the time - maybe a 12 year old will find the jokes funny, everyone else will be rolling their eyes all the time.Jack Black.... well....I think he's funny, but he's boring in this movie. Either he overacts all the time, or he, well... keeps overacting a bit more. You never get to care about him, because quite frankly, you get the feeling all the things he does are for himself. You never get the feeling he cares about everyone else, or he does something for someone else. Boring...Still, most people seem to like this one. I'm left scratching my head and wondering what on earth did I miss this time.",4,2,7,2 August 2005
Cars 2," Pixar's Edsel.
","It had to happen. Nobody's perfect, and they had to fail sometime.And it's not that it's a bad movie. Far from it. It's just that whenever I see Lasseter and Bird's names, the LAST thing I can think about is a mediocre movie. I'm one of the very few people (apparently enough) who LOVES Cars - so I really was waiting for its sequel.I should have known after watching Tron: Legacy. John Lasseter is losing his magic touch. If he was really involved on that movie's plot, then something happened to his movie-making talent. This, the next movie he's involved in, suffers from the same problems.I won't spoil the movie for you - you already know what it's all about, anyway. The story is far too complex for a kid (I was left scratching my head at the end about certain things). There are too many new characters to care about. The show is stolen by Mater, and not in a good way - he was funny in the first movie as a supporting character, but he's just not likable enough to carry the movie all by himself; I was expecting a Lightning McQueen movie, after all. When it all comes down to it, the plot is absolutely unremarkable - and that's quite a remarkable thing, considering this is Pixar we are talking about.I *suppose* this has to do with the Mouse House. Back when Pixar was an independent studio they could do anything they could ever want. Now they are part of a bigger company, and they seem to be following their directions. Why? Well, have you seen Disney's California Adventure? That park was a disgrace, and part of the things they are doing to fix it is creating - yep, you guessed it - Radiator Springs, which will be opened in 2012. I can imagine the pressure was on Pixar to create a sequel to a sort of unloved movie, and as much as Lasseter and Bird tried to create something like The Incredibles, they ended up with, yep, you guessed again, their brand new Edsel.Here's hope Pixar can do a comeback with their next film.",4,0,3,26 June 2011
Moulin Rouge!," A modern cinematic masterpiece
","Being a fan of silent cinema, it strikes me as odd that I liked so much this movie. Then again, there is a very good reason for this.During the silent cinema golden era, visionary directors such as Fritz Lang, F.W. Murnau and others created bizarre interpretations of our world. They effectively expanded our perceptions by incorporating cinematic tricks, such as slanted angles, futuristic sets, chiaroscuro shots, and others.Moulin Rouge should be grouped among these movie wonders.This is cinematic art at its very best. The cinematography is fast, furious, and concise. Gripping. It locks your attention to the movie like no other I remember watching...(From now on, the review is *Chock full of spoilers*). ... for example, the opening shot, which is a movie theater within a movie theater, projecting an old movie of an old Moulin Rouge, with a music director conducting an orchestra playing the 20th Century Fox fanfare. Marvelous. The ending shot, with the gun flying overhead the Moulin Rouge and crashing with the Eiffel Tower. The entire depiction of the Moulin Rouge is amazing. The genius of the main character singing 'Your Song' to the prostitute. 'Roxanne' by The Police as a tango. Sheer geniality.Oh, and in case you are wondering, yes, there is a plot. And the ending is simply beautiful.You cannot miss it. It is a shoo-in for a perfect ten. It gets a 9, though, because I don't know how it will stand the test of time.",10,0,1,27 August 2001
Men in Black II," What were you people expecting, anyway? It's MIB!
","Which means -It isn't supposed to be serious. It isn't supposed to make sense. It isn't supposed to be serious sci-fi. It is supposed to entertain.It's not the best movie out there, granted (although I found it A LOT more enjoyable than 'Episode II'). It's not the sequel I expected to see (Agent K is very subdued this time). And it isn't as imaginative as the first time (probably because shock value is a one time trick). But it's entertaining, a bit disturbing (watch out for the closing scene - it tops the first one's ending), funny (Frank dressed up as an MIB agent is one of the funniest scenes I can remember in a long time), and at parts, clever.It doesn't try to be a serious sci-fi film. It merely seeks to entertain. And I was entertained for as long as the movie lasted.Again - it's not the sequel I expected, but it's not as bad as many of the comments say. And yes, I do think it's a lot better (as far as entertainment value goes) than 'Episode II'. Big surprise, huh? :)",5,0,0,22 July 2002
Coco," Stunning, beautiful, colorful, powerful, sad, happy. A joy of a ride.
","I may be biased, since this movie portrayed perfectly what life is all about in a small Mexican town. Or, perhaps I wanted to see Pixar really get back on the game. Go beyond Up, and make a complete movie that was as beautiful as the first 20 minutes of Wall-E.I got my wish. This is the movie I wanted Pixar to make, once again. A movie about what family means. A movie about the choices we make, and the roads not taken. This is a stunning work of art. It'll move you from happiness to tears, from memories of the past to the joy of the future. To understanding, to remembrance. To the joys and pains of being alive.I can't even begin to imagine how Pixar made a movie about life and death that is so colorful, so absorbing, so poignant, and so approachable for kids, and with so many layers upon layers upon layers of meaning and significance for adults.To watch Coco is to love Coco, and to remember the Cocos in your life that are no longer among us.Thank you, Pixar.",10,282,377,28 October 2017
The Nightmare Before Christmas," Absolutely beautiful.
","When watching Burton films, you have to be really careful. Style over substance could be the best description of what to look out for; so much eye candy, so little plot.'Nightmare' does not fall into this cliché. This film is absolutely wonderful; the best ever to come out of Tim Burton's creative brain. It's a knockout.The story is truly an original one: what would happen if the Pumpkin King wanted to take over Christmas, too? Starting from there, all sorts of individual implications come out. Why did Jack want to do that? Why was he sad, lonely and depressed? How come the characters are so real that they are not good or bad, merely human, when they are made out of clay? What would the love of Sally be able to accomplish at the end? And how would the nightmare be finally solved?This film solves all this questions beautifully, in a stunning land, where human feelings abound. There is obsession, passion, love, loyalty, courage and humility to be found everywhere, all within the bodies of these wonderful puppets. That a film so artificial can be so profoundly human and moving is no small feat. This is one of my '10' movies. Simply perfect.",10,1,2,23 September 2001
Caddyshack," So full of witty one-liners, such a bad movie
","I know I'll get blasted for this, but...Caddyshack is a bad movie. A bad, mediocre movie. A boring movie, at times.Dangerfield, Chase and Murray are not over the top here. They are waaaay over that. Each one of them displays their range whenever they get to appear on screen. Dangerfield is incredibly hilarious, Chase is dry and witty (sorta like David Spade), and Murray does his best ever imitation of Bluto Blutarsky (John Belushi). Oh, and let's not forget the gopher. The mere thought of it makes me laugh.So, how on earth did no one notice that the audiences would be interested in the interaction between those three? I can only think of one scene where Chase and Dangerfield appeared together, and they might have crossed one or two words. Meanwhile, we are subjected to the tediousness of stale, bad jokes made by all the caddies. Maybe I am wrong here, but if I had gathered those 3 comedic geniuses, I would have made a picture around them. Harold Ramis instead made a movie about an unknown, who nobody cared (or cares) about, and littered the film with sporadic appearances by the top notch actors.Kinda like going to a Pink Floyd concert and learning that they would sing 4 of their best songs, separated by 10-15 minutes of music by bad bands.Still, I rate this one a 7 / 10, just because the actors really push the script to the limit (that is, if there was a script to begin with). Take out the caddies, hire top comedians, and re-do Caddyshack. The right way. Please.",4,2,12,28 February 2002
Jurassic World," Yet more proof Steven Spielberg is a hack who should be kept away from a camera
","Sure, the action scenes are fun. Let's get that out of the way, because that's pretty much everything that is right about this movie.Certain people did one or two things right. George Lucas, for example. Steven Spielberg is another. But every single piece of cinema he has done after, say, Jaws, or Indiana Jones, is simply terrible.Take this movie. Jurassic Park had a certain charm, but once you get past the couple of minutes of CGI, you notice how terrible the movie is. Bad acting, bad plot, terrible acting, ham-fisted approach to storytelling, horrible acting, you name it.All of this - and more - is in this movie. It's basically a remake of Jurassic Park - it's the exact same premise, with mostly the same characters. Can Spielberg think of anything else other than child geniuses? The story is laughable - you get this feeling that the characters need to do something, fast, and they stop and try to drive the story... slooooowly. The ham-fisted approach is there - characters won't only tell you what is going on, but what exactly is going to happen. The whole movie feels like a mega-million dollar school project.Once, I thought Spielberg was an amazing presence in the movie business. But that was 30 years ago. Right now, I can't imagine why people flock to watch his movies. Perhaps because the alternatives are even worse.Save your time, watch it on video. Better yet, avoid.",5,2,7,28 June 2015
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," I haven't seen the original. As it is, though... this movie is *awesome*
","Just like 'Big Fish' before it... 'Charlie' is so warm, sweet, and enjoyable, I do believe Tim Burton is my favorite movie director ever.The lessons to be learned in this charming story are many, and the story is simply fun. Johnny Depp is creepier than Michael Jackson at times (his acting is fantastic). Luckily, he can be left alone with kids without lawsuits flying all over the place. The kids are perfect stereotypes for the Oompa-Loompas to trick. The scenery and stages are perfect - full of colour everywhere, yet as dark as any Tim Burton movie out there. The whole movie is a bit dark, although in a cheery kind of way. It seems as if the main characters have a ray of sunshine guiding their actions all the time, so even if you sense the desperation in Charlie's parents, and the sadness of Willy Wonka, somehow you know everything will turn out all right.Even if it's a bit slow during the first part, this has to be one of my favourite movies of the year.",7,1,5,13 December 2005
Big Fish," Masterpiece.
","This must be Tim Burton's masterpiece - an amazing portrayal of father / son relationships brought forward by a series of metaphors, which ends up quite surprisingly. After watching the film, I bought the novel and was (gasp!) disappointed by it. The novel is drier, a lot more realistic, and colder in its approach. Burton's movie is a lot warmer, funnier, exaggerated, and poignant. I watched this movie with my father - it was a most moving experience.Tim Burton's style is quite a feast for the eyes, too. Combining a fantasy story with his strange, eerie vision makes the whole movie a feast for the eyes; the metaphors, combined with surrealistic settings that never seem to fit quite right in reality are fantastic. I'd find it hard to choose between this movie and 'Nightmare Before Christmas'...",10,0,0,18 July 2005
The Dark Knight," The Definitive Batman. The Definitive Super Hero movie.
","And one of the best movies ever made, in my opinion. Simply stunning.Considering 'Titanic' had droves of teenage chicks just dying to watch Di Caprio and Winslet do the nasty on the back seat of a Renault car over and over again, it's a tremendous achievement that this movie came so close to the total BO of that film. But it's not surprising. This movie is absolutely flawless - even if you don't care about Batman. It's gripping, the plot is thought-provoking, it has the best Joker ever to be on screen, key scenes are on IMAX...While Burton's 'Batman' is a comic book turned into a movie, The Dark Knight is the best real life adaptation anyone could ever wish of our favorite caped crusader. And it's the best superhero movie ever made. And, again, I wouldn't be surprised at all if it marked a generation the way Star Wars did. It deserves to.",8,4,8,21 November 2008
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," Stunning...
","Right next to 'Before Sunrise', this has to be the best movie that ever tried to explain the process of falling in love.While 'Sunrise' does it in a chronological way, though, this one attempts to deconstruct a relationship from the ending right through the beginning, which is actually very interesting. Even though we feel we 'know' how the movie will end, we are still willing to go along for the ride. In a way, this also mirrors 'Sunrise' - you know that the ending will not be a happy affair, and yet you still want to live through the lives of the main characters just to find out more about what happens next.Jim Carrey, one of the greatest underrated actors ever, gives an incredible performance - I'm willing to believe many people would never believe it's him.This is one of the best movies I've ever seen... easily, a solid 10.",10,0,3,22 May 2008
Avatar," You've seen it before. It looks better here, but that's about it.
","This review is full of spoilers.You've seen the story before. It's basically 'Pocahontas' on some other planet - even with silly song numbers throughout the movie. You've seen the whole 'everything is connected to everything else' deal, and glowing effects all around the characters - in the 80's, in 'Tron'. You've seen the battle between the natives against the evil empire - in 'Return of the Jedi'. You'll feel a bit ill when you realize you are looking at thousands of Jar Jar Binks on the screen all the time, just like in the prequels. And everything else - you'll just know Cameron simply stole it from 'The Matrix' trilogy (right down to the 'plug-in' sequences and the human-controlled robots). There's even a 'Tank' character, but this time it's a female - and it's also from Latin America! You'll immediately know which characters live and which ones will die at the end. You won't have to guess twice at who the bad guy is. You'll know exactly what will happen and how it will all end.You'll notice how poor the acting is (come on, the lead from 'The Hottie and the Nottie' as a scientist?). You'll be bothered by jumps in continuity ('where did that guy come from???'). And you'll find out that James Cameron simply cannot edit a movie to its proper length, even if his life depended on it - you could cut 1 hour of this one and it wouldn't detract much from what it is.And you'll have nightmares all over again about Celine Dion - when you listen to the songs on this one. It's 'Titanic' music all over again. Same conductor, same style of music. The song at the end is a dead ringer for 'My heart will go on'. Ack.Sure, the visuals are awesome - if you catch it on 3D. If you don't, well, you'll be bothered by things that you just know should be jumping out at you, but in 2D, they look like someone's afterthought.6 stars, only because it looks awesome.

Toy Story 2," A feast for the eyes and senses
","Seldom does a film appears that warrants a comment. Episode I should have been that film this year, but the only thing that can be said about it is that it was the biggest disappointment ever. Enter Toy Story 2. A film that *should* have been a disappointment. The original was a great film, a milestone. How could it be that the sequel was better? Well, it is better. So much better in fact that it has been the most enjoyable film I have seen this year. I can't remember a cartoon or computer animated film that could make me cry since 'Beauty and the Beast'. Toy Story 2 managed that, and it also made me laugh as a kid 10 seconds afterwards. It is a real joyride, a masterpiece, a film with true content (the meaning of life), and it stresses the values of friendship, loyalty and love.If I had kids, I would take them to see this gem time and time again. This are the values that are so sorely missing in films nowadays. What are you waiting for? Go see it! Francisco.",10,0,1,21 December 1999
Up," Pixar just raised the bar to unreachable new heights
","I just can't understand how they manage to do it all the time. Up may just well be the best animated movie I've ever watched. It may beat anything Walt Disney ever made. In my opinion, it's even better than anything else Pixar has done. How can they do it?There are no real objects in this film; everything is made by computers. So, how is it possible that Carl plays with our emotions they way he does? Why is it that, 10 minutes into the movie, we *are* Carl, and become one with his journey? I have no clue about it.

Titanic," Proof enough that P.T. Barnum was right.
","Yes, he was right. There is one s____r born every minute. This movie proves that enough of those were born to carry this waste of celluloid to $1.6 billion dollars in gross earnings.'Waste of celluloid'? No, wait. That's a gross exaggeration. Actually, you could snip out all the scenes with Leonardo diCaprio and Kate Winslet, shorten the sinking scenes by 1/2, add some historical characters, and end up with a glorious 1 1/2 - 2 hour movie. Because, as it is, this movie is a gross slap on the face of all those who lost their lives on that ship, who seemingly died so that Kate Winslet could 'live her life to the fullest extent'.The movie, well, it's unwatchable. Completely, totally unwatchable as it is. That is, if you are not a 15 year old girl with a crush on diCaprio. For the rest of us, the movie drags incredibly slowly. Honestly, I only wanted for the thing to start sinking after the first hour.OTOH, the sinking scenes are terrific. Way above average. Very, very good. But what's the use of those scenes when you have to endure the pain of 1 1/2 hours of romantic nonsense? Especially when there is absolutely NO chemistry between the main characters.I have another idea. Steal some scenes from 'A Night to Remember', cut the sinking scenes from 'Titanic', and make a new movie. That would be good.... but no hordes of screaming girls would attend the movie, so no box office records could be made, so no Hollywood director would attempt to do it.

The Matrix Reloaded," I am surprised. It wasn't as bad as I thought it would be!
","As a matter of fact, it was good entertainment. Very good.Reading through all the negative comments, I have to wonder if I saw the same film as the rest of the people around here. Or whether my expectations were too low, or my standards are. Either way, I enjoyed this film way too much to be believed. And I sincerely thought this movie would be an awfully bad one.Comparing the Star Wars films (the new ones) to Matrix is an injustice. George Lucas is too inept and boring to be compared to any filmmaker alive - he's the Ed Wood of our generation. Comparing Matrix to LOTR is an excercise in futility - people who have read the books actually know how the Trilogy will end. Matrix is something... different. It's a lot of special effects, a lot of philosophical talk, and, yep, lots of surprises.I have *actually* talked with my boss for one hour straight about what Matrix: Revolutions will be like, and what, exactly, is the Matrix. And I guess that's what this movie is about - it gives you lots of hints about what the Matrix really is, but never tells you exactly what to expect. Given this approach, it's practically impossible to judge whether this was a good film or not. It absolutely depends on Revolutions and Matrix I to tell it's story - whether it's Neo's past or future, no answers can be found on Reloaded.Given this situation, it's quite difficult to judge this movie as a stand-alone product.But that damn car chase... whoa.ps Am I the only one who is actually expecting to hear Keanu Reeves shout 'Most Excellent, Dude!' everytime he cocks his head to the side in amazement?",5,0,0,26 May 2003
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Actually... it wasn't a bad movie. I can't believe it.
","After watching the first two fiascoes (the prequels), I certainly didn't have any hopes for this one. I was expecting a whiny Darth Vader (Palpie! My light saber is, like, SOOO UNCOOOL! I hate it, hate it, hate it! - and so on), a terrible storyline, predictable plot, and slow... s-l-o-w storytelling.Oh, and terrible acting. Did I mention it? No? Well, Lucas seems to be the only man alive that can bring the worst out of Liam Neeson and Ewan Mcgregor.Anyway, I was happily surprised to see that, although his dialog was beyond laughable, Lucas did it right this time. I can't remember being as amazed as I was with this movie since 'Empire' came out. This is the Star Wars that should have been since 1999 - the stuff kids can dream about for years and years.I was very satisfied with this movie, and can imagine it'll be considered as the only worthy addition to the original trilogy. It's a lot better than Return of the Jedi, and easily on par with the original Star Wars.I only wonder - will Lucas revisit his movies once again? If he does so, he'd do a good thing if he took Episodes I and II and turned them into a 2 hour movie... and digitally removed that whiny kid. And the lizard we all love to hate.",6,3,7,28 July 2005
Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs," Landmark
","What else can be said about this film? Much more than the first full length animated motion picture, it is a testament to the will and vision of Walt Disney. He always risked his own money, his own properties, in order to build all the things he believed in (pretty much the same happened at Disneyland, where he couldn't find any capital, so he had to put a mortgage on his own life insurance policy). There is so much love and devotion thrown into this film, I severely doubt it will ever stop being such a classic (that is, not considering the beautiful animation, drawings and songs, which easily put to shame many modern animation films).And Adriana Caselloti's voice... wow. Beautiful. I can hardly wait for the DVD.",9,1,2,24 September 2001

","Superb drawings. Good moral message. Very good songs. Then, what is it that separates this movie from the best (ie, 'Fantasia', 'Toy Story 2', 'Beauty and the Beast')?A very good question, indeed. It may be Disney's love for musical number (the grating 'I just can't wait to be king' is the worst offender here). Or the fact that this movie was released so close to what is arguably the best animated film of all time: 'Beauty and the Beast'. Or it could be that audiences could not easily relate to lions and hiennas.Either way, the small bad points of this movie are completely overshadowed by the grandiose moments in it, such as the opening sequence (pretty much the best I've ever seen in an animated film), or Scaar's rise to power in a scene very much alike a Nazi congregation.Still waiting fro the DVD to come out...",9,0,0,4 August 2002

","Coming from the company that invented, and has redefined the limits of the genre time and time again, perhaps Wall-E shouldn't come as a surprise. Then again, when you are treated to what may as well be the best 40 minutes of animation I've ever seen, coupled with one of the most lovable characters ever designed, and a story that resonates with children and adults alike, you can't help but be amazed at the incredible movie-making of Pixar.This is, quite probably, the best movie the company has ever made. Considering that every single one of them has been the greatest animated movie of any given year, that's quite an achievement. Wall-E is able to convey emotions in a way very few human actors can do - an incredible feat. The world he lives in is so real, at times I had to wonder which parts were computer animation and which ones were not. Camera-work is incredibly lifelike - at no time at all I felt I was watching an animated movie.But the thing that Pixar does best, the thing that no other animation company has ever been able to replicate (in my opinion), is the way they infuse everything they do with a healthy dose of love, respect, empathy and affection. The emotional rush you get from watching every one of their movies is one of the reasons why I believe they are the best movie studio out there right now.",10,0,2,21 November 2008
The Cannonball Run," So bad it's good. Yeah, it's one of those films.
","Where do I start? Oh, boy.This is worse than Plan 9 from Outer Space. At least Ed Wood was quite frank about not having enough money for a decent film, yet he attempted on doing exactly that. He failed miserably.Cannonball Run is quite frank about having enough money to make a decent film, and not even trying to do so, generating so many laughs in the process, it's kinda excusable.It lacks everything. Character development. A strong plotline. Well crafted humor. Nice racing sequences. Yet it's a sweet failure, just because it's so bad, yet so true, you can't do anything except watch in amazement and say 'I can't believe it'.What am I talking about? Well, remember the ambulance incident? It's true. It actually happened. Yes, it did happen to Brock Yates, his wife and director Hal Needham. They entered the race in the ambulance, they were stopped in New Jersey, and the dialogue is shown in the film (with a bit of artistic license, of course).Remember the guy who rammed the entrance of the hotel? Well, the character is based on a real guy who did ram walls in order to get to the highways faster than the rest. And he did ask at the hotel he stayed, 'Where are the w____s at?'Watch it while knowing many things are based on fact, and you will see the movie is so bad, you can't help but wonder how on earth this race could have been run for 5 years.It's good.",5,0,3,4 November 2002
Shrek," Summer is getting better...
","So, I watch Pearl Harbor, and almost lose my faith in Hollywood.Then, Shrek comes by. Yes!!!What can I say. It's a very enjoyable movie experience, aided by the vocal talents of Myers, Murphy and Diaz. I couldn't stop laughing when Murphy (or the donkey) was on screen. Myers wasn't that funny, but he had an ogre to portrait, so it was to be expected. Cameron Diaz was hilarious. Heck, everyone was hilarious.Spoiler ahead:You might wet your pants when the parody of 'It's a small world' comes out!This movie is a definite 9, 4.5 stars out of 10, maybe the best Dreamworks production to date. And I don't expect the Jurassic Dinos to come even close. It's a must-not-miss!",6,1,2,9 July 2001
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Awful. For all their money, DC can't seem to make a likable movie about Batman or Superman lately
","First: we all knew Henry Cavill would suck. He sucked before, it was just a matter of time before he was absolutely unlikeable as Superman again.Second: the minute Ben Assfleck was cast as Batman, we knew we were in deep trouble. He can be a good actor, but here's one word: Daredevil. Third: Zack Snyder. Need I say more?While Robert Downey Jr. and the rest create likable characters in a likable universe, with interesting settings and issues, this movie is all about big explosions, bizarre relationships and... well, not much more. Where did the third major player come out from? Why was she there? Where's the rest of the Justice League? Why was it all dumb explosions? Could they have found a dumber Lex Luthor? Why on earth would Batman care so much about what Superman was telling to him in the end? Why did I waste 2.5 hours, when this movie was so absurd, so empty, so stupid? Really, Ant-Man is Oscar material next to this. Guardians of the Galaxy is a thousand times better. And those are the small Marvel Universe movies. Why did they insist on casting Henry Cavill and Ben Affleck is beyond me. They destroyed the franchise before it started.",4,2,6,26 March 2016
The Emperor's New Groove," It's all about Spade!
","Am I alone in thinking Disney's 'Tarzan' was boring?Am I alone in thinking that, actually, all animated Disney films were sub-par since 'The Lion King'?Did I think that the future of Disney was Pixar, and not the animation department? Oh, yes. I did. Guilty.This is Disney's proof that they can still make an amazingly good movie. I am very surprised, though. I understand that the studio has two animation teams, which work on different Disney projects. One of them is far more powerful than the other, with more resources. If that is true, then Disney should promote the team that created 'Emperor', because, even tough it looks very cheaply made (when compared to Disney's high standards) it is a very entertaining, very good, very groovy film.It's all about Spade, actually. Reprising his role in 'Tommy Boy', we see the acidic, sarcastic character. He likes to torture everyone around him. He finds in Pacha his 'Tommy' (if you haven't seen that film, it is highly recommended), a guy who is noble, likeable and sweet (as a matter of fact, both films are very similar, being 'road trips' in some sort of sense). He, as you might expect, subjects his partner to all kinds of humiliations, until he learns his moral lesson. Pretty simple stuff, but it is handled with heavy doses of humor everywhere. This film succeeds because everything is funny, lighthearted and uncomplicated. Forget Tarzan's luscious scenery, or Hunchback's feeble attempts at humour launched at a mostly depressing scenario. This film is fast, furious and lighthearted. And musical interludes are kept to a minimum, and when used they are very effective. Yes!I loved it. I can only hope Atlantis will be as good as this one. A solid 9 (had it been animated by the 'heavy honchos' of Disney, the result would have been different... surely for the worst).",9,1,2,30 April 2001
Toy Story 3," Absolutely stunning ending to the best trilogy of all time
","I won't play with words - Toy Story 3 is the best film I've watched in a long time. It may be the best movie I've ever watched, actually - I was amazed, blown away, driven to tears. I laughed, cheered, cried. It made me feel alive, like very few movies before it.It's no secret - Pixar is the studio that cannot make a bad movie, even if they tried. But this movie goes far beyond anything they have ever done - they have made a CG movie that makes any live action one feel wooden and... fake.The Toy Story Trilogy is a tribute to every single value that makes us human beings. It has love, friendship, values. It dares to explore the most complex of human emotions via a bunch of plastic toys. It goes places where adult movies rarely dare to go, because they don't have a worthy comment about anything in the end.Pixar understands human nature, and makes us proud about it. Thank you, Pixar, for devoting your lives and souls to making movies. Thank you for Woody, Buzz, Hamm, Rex, and the rest. Thank you for making me laugh, cry, think and contemplate life. Your legacy will surely not be forgotten soon.",10,3,5,19 June 2010
Before Sunrise," Simply beautiful / Beautifully simple
","I love this film. I love it to pieces. I saw it on a movie theater some 4 years ago, and I have never quite forgotten it. Whenever I see an elderly couple, I am reminded of one of the first lines of the film: 'When people grow up, men lose hearing on the high tones, and women lose hearing in the low end. That's why it's so difficult to get along'. Simplistic? Maybe. Beautiful? Beyond any shadow of a doubt.The idea of a night in Vienna with someone you just met, falling in love and waking up to a very different reality is so full of hope and sadness. The characters know that everything will be over at sunrise, and yet they risk having a heartbreak, rather focusing on having the best night of their lives. This valiant approach makes the movie so much harder to take at the ending, when reality strikes and tears flow from my eyes.Movies should always be THIS good.",10,10,16,19 November 2000
The Sixth Sense," What a child actor!
","The Sixth Sense is a very good movie in itself (and yes, the ending is really something, with a twist I only saw that year in Fight Club... great). But the real credit goes to Haley Joel Osment, or 'Cole'. This child can really act. I watched the movie on home video (because I was pretty scared of watching it in a movie theater), and all the time I could only think about his acting; he looked wise beyond his age, more like a seasoned actor than an 11 year old kid. I think he has a great future ahead of him.
As a strange coincidence, I watched 'The Exorcist' 1 day before this film, and reached a conclusion: while Linda Blair was the star of the film (with Max von Sydow, of course), I couldn't stand Chris MacNeil at all. This limited my enjoyment of the movie, since her character appeared too often. Her overacting should not be excused. I couldn't find this flaw in 'The Sixth Sense', where Bruce Willis acted great.This film stands out from the rest because it makes you spend the entire time trying to figure out the ending, and by the time you think you know what will happen, you get a rather chilling surprise. What a masterpiece.",8,0,0,6 August 2000
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Is this the best Star Wars movie ever?
","I was absolutely sure this was going to be an epic failure. Disney. Star Wars. The horrible taste the prequels left us with. I watched the prequels before watching the movie. They were even worse than I remembered them. Atrocious. Unwatchable. The best thing that could ever happen was Disney getting Lucasfilm off George Lucas' hands. There. I said it. George Lucas, thank you for not being involved AT ALL in this movie. You almost destroyed Star Wars with the 'prequels'.But JJ Abrams and Disney... they created a masterpiece. This is movie is so stunning in so many levels I can only compare it to when I was 3 years old and watched Star Wars in a huge movie theatre. Goosebumps, chills, the whole deal. This movie feels real, looks real, just like the original trilogy did. This is amazing - I couldn't imagine Disney topping 'Episode 4' - but in my humble opinion, they did.Disney, JJ Abrams, everyone involved - feel proud about yourselves. You made me forget the prequels ever existed, and made me feel like a 3 year old kid for 2 hours. If these guys do Episode 8 and somehow state that the prequels were 'some sort of mythology that never happened', I'll be happy for the rest of my life.10/10",8,2,25,19 December 2015
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2," Such an epic disappointment.
","It actually took me years to watch the first 3 Harry Potter movies, which I considered to be aimed straight at kids. Once I did, I really found myself enjoying them (especially Prisoner of Azkaban, IMHO the best of the series), so I decided to get the books.I've read them twice since them, and found them entertaining - and I thought the first three movies were very faithful to them, given the time constraints.It all seemed to change with Order of The Phoenix, though. While the earlier movies felt like a story being told, OOP was more like a bunch of disjointed scenes that the viewer had to assemble into a plot. I thought The Half Blood Prince was the worst - from talking with friends, it was obvious there was so much stuff thrown out from the books some things didn't make any sense at all (as if, who cared who The Half Blood Prince was - the movie never made it obvious).Enter the epic finale. Once I finished reading the last HP book, I was pretty surprised J.K. Rowling actually made simply the best ending I could ever think of, and wondered how it'd look on the big screen. One word: terrible. Director David Yates should have been fired a long time ago (after Half Blood Prince) - and the Deathly Hallows suffers under his helm. It's completely disjointed - even though he had two movies to tell the story, the MAJOR plot points are missing: the real Albus Dumbledore life story, Kreacher's conversion, Snape's story, Harry's decision to seek the Horcruxes instead of the Hallows, the real way Harry defeated Voldemort, the sacrifices some of the characters went through (and the deaths of some major ones) - it's all gone or severely cut, and it was replaced by tons of CGI and lame one-liners.I suppose WB thought they'd rather go for epic fights, instead of telling the entire story as it was meant to be told, fearing people would not understand it. Sad.I have to wonder whether people who didn't read the books understand where the mirror came from, why Dumbledore's brother was still angry at him, why Neville killed Nagini when only Ron and Hermione knew they had to, and why Dumbledore used Harry the way he did. I guess not.",6,13,20,17 July 2011
The Matrix," There is no spoon...
","'The Matrix' came out on the worst of times: just weeks before the most anticipated sci-fi film of all time was to come out: 'The Phantom Menace'.Well the menace was definitely 'a phantom', so to speak. And while hordes of gullible fans talked about how great Lucas' latest space opera was, many more had discovered what they feared the most: that Matrix was everything 'Phantom' should have been, and then more.The film has so many high points is difficult to start. The visual effects are simply stunning; there is no eye candy, ala Star Wars I; every single one is used as a way to get you deeper into the movie. The 'Bullet time' technique is used throughout the picture, and it makes it seem as slick as the best piece of japanimation out there. The storyline is perfectly written: it manages to convince you that somehow it could all be possible. Neo/Thomas Anderson (Keanu Reeves) tells the whole story with his facial expressions of disbelief on the first 3/4 of the film, and then with self assurance. The rest of the cast makes you actually care for their fate (specially Carrie-Ann Moss and Lawrence Fishborne). And before the first half of the movie is over, you will hate the bad guys. Believe me.I, as incredible as it might seem, am not waiting for 'Matrix 2'. The first installment is so good I fear they won't be able to live up to its reputation (again, like Lucas did with 'Phantom Menace'). Still, I am crossing my fingers and hoping I will be surprised and mesmerized. Again.",9,0,0,3 June 2000
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," The real thing
","It would not be fair to talk about this film and say that it changed my life; it wouldn't be accurate. It actually defined what I wanted to be (and no, I don't attend Star Wars meetings or anything like that; in fact, I kinda feel sorry for the guys that actually dress like their favorite characters from the movie).I have been a fencer for quite some time now. I am also an electromechanical engineer with a master's degree in computer science. I am still surprised to think that maybe Star Wars had a lot to do with it. All I know is that this is the only movie I remember watching when I was a young child (3 years old, to be precise), and that the excitement I felt hasn't worn off. Oh no, not the least.This movie has to be my favourite one of all time. The premise is so simple, the acting is straightforward and the plot is coherent. But most important of it, you actually care about everyone in the film. Maybe because character development is so strong throughout the film, or because it is a very well told story. A simple tale of good versus evil, told in the best of ways.And so I am sitting here in front of my computer, wondering if how is it possible that a 2 hour story helped me find out what I wanted to be. I am not sure, but there is one thing I know: the best movie I will ever see is this one. Star Wars.(Sadly, George Lucas decided to destroy the trilogy by issuing a shame of a movie as a prequel: The Phantom Menace. I guess nobody is perfect.)",10,0,0,16 June 2000
Tarzan," Anaheim, we have a problem.
","I am afraid Disney is losing its movie making magic.A couple of months ago I went to Disneyland with a couple of friends (30ish, I myself am 25), and had the time of my life. We all agreed this place had a strange magic in it, a redeeming quality that went beyond its 100 acre site and went deep into your subconscious. We were grinning the minute we went in, and we were still like that 12 hours later. We went 2 days in a row to the park, and we were delighted.  OTOH, we all think Disney World is the blandest, most artificial theme park ever.Tarzan, Pocahontas, Hunchback and everything else after 'Lion King' seems to be like Disney World to me. Excess, excess (CGI animation, hyper-expensive songs by worn-out semi-pop stars (Phil Collins? how can you have Elton John do 'Lion King' and then Phil Collins???), an ultra-expensive cast) doesn't mean a good movie. Beauty and the Beast is a hauntingly beautiful movie. Lion King is a very good movie. Tarzan is not.The only hope I still have is that the Disney Studios sometimes release very, very good stuff (Toy Story 2 has to be the best animated feature I've ever seen in my life). Sadly, people seem to ignore them in favor of the commercial, 'safe' features.I can only hope my kids can still see Disneyland the way my grandmother, my mother and myself saw it. Yet, Disney wants to corrupt this park, too. Have you seen 'California Adventure', the new park opposite Disneyland? The Disney people seem only to care about money nowadays.Needless to say, Walt wouldn't be proud.",6,0,3,21 October 2000
Monty Python and the Holy Grail," A film that will stand the test of time.
","Warning: Mild spoilers ahead.Monty Python and the Holy Grail is the finest example of what you can do when resources are low, impetus are high, and the world's finest comedy troupe assembles to have some fun. The film was made as if a group of old friends were to come together and simply have some fun behind a camera. So spontaneus. But then, the magic of verbal exchanges as inspired as the African/European Swallow demonstrate once and for all that its not only vulgarity that can make you laugh... inspired pseudo-intellectual exchanges will, too. And that's Monty Python. The witch hunt (where it is scientifically demonstrated that you can distinguish a witch from a human) is an extreme example of intellectual stupidity. It's so much fun watching a group of educated, intelligent and astute people having a go at each other.It's not all intellectual stuff, though. The Killer Rabbit scene is very, very similar to the dog fight in 'Something about Mary', but without sexual innuendo or having to resort to obscenity. It's simply a stuffed rabbit being tossed around, killing the brave knights. Arguably, the best, silliest part of the film. Or what about the initial credits, filled with mooses? Or the Knights who say Ni? Or Castle Anthrax? or...This film is simply amazing. I have watched it more than 20 times in less than 3 years, and intend to keep on doing it. It's a delight, a simple, silly movie that will make you laugh without leaving a bad aftertaste. Good fun.",9,0,0,19 January 2001
A Walk to Remember," Weak, cliché-ridden and predictable, yet vaguely amusing
","The good: it's passable. Barely.The bad: It's just a rehash of the usual 'boy meets girl, falls in love, girl ((spoiler deleted))' we have all seen in movies such as 'Love Story' (minus the hyper-annoying musical score of that one).The veredict: Watch it with a girl you like. Impress her with your sensitivity. Try not to laugh when she starts crying, and try, by all means, not to remind her there are love stories men like, too (for example, the magnificent 'Before Sunrise', with Julie Delphy and Ethan Hawke) because they are GOOD, not poorly acted, with no underdeveloped characters, and with no clichés whatsoever.After all, we men have a heart, too.",2,1,3,24 June 2002
Gangs of New York," I don't get it. Maybe I saw a different movie than the rest.
","Many people are praising this movie beyond words.Maybe I went into the wrong theater.I went in expecting to see an epic on the creation of New York City, and the shape it took after hordes of immigrants made it the cosmopolitan place it is now.What I got instead was 2 straight hours of diCaprio wooing Cameron Diaz, and some 40 minutes of actual politics and gang wars.Don't get me wrong - I HATED this movie. Hated every second of it. Hated Martin Scorsese for having succumbed to 'Cameron's Syndrome' (which is, not being able to stop showing diCaprio as a sex symbol instead of concentrating in actually telling a story). It is 'Titanic' meets New York in the worst of ways. I hate diCaprio, because after 'What's eating Gilbert Grape' he hasn't been able to make one decent movie, while turning every single film he has been in into a tribute to his personna.I now can only wish some other director will actually try and tackle this subject with a shred more of dignity, all while telling a story that actually makes some sense. 'Gangs of New York' is a terrible effort - a movie that should and could have been the best movie of the year. Instead, it is a tribute to diCaprio with a couple minutes dedicated to the actual story of the Gangs of New York. Pathetic.",4,2,6,6 January 2003
The Wedding Singer," Sweet
","This is a very, very sweet movie. The story is as simple as they get: boy meets girl, boy loses girl, boy gets girl. It's just that Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore are made to star in this movie.Add to the mix a heavy dose of 80's pop culture and the film changes from romantic comedy to a beautiful one. The settings shown are lush, brightly colored and cheerfully happy. The songs are anthemic, uplifting and memorable. The overall effect is a cheery, happy film that contrasts *a lot* with the darker 90s.If you ever had a 'Relax' tank-top or a 'Choose Life' T-shirt, this is the film for you.",8,0,1,24 November 2000
Jurassic Park," Nice dinos, but what about the people?
","After watching Disney's 'Dinosaur', I simply had to come back and watch this movie to see why I had liked it more in the first place.Well, it might have been because Jurassic Park is, unabashedly, a grown-up film, while Dinosaur walks the thin line between a kiddie flick and an all-out adult assault on the senses. And I couldn't stop noticing the fact that 7 years of advance in CGI haven't been all that wonderful. I still somehow think that JP's creatures are more realistic than Dinosaurs'. Maybe the fact that the Disney flick had to make the creatures talk and have facial expressions were the reasons I give the nod to JP's beastly creatures any day, any time.But then, I focused on the characters. Excluding Ian Malcolm and John Hammond (Jeff Goldblum and Richard Attenborough), I reached the conclusion that I hated the rest of the cast almost as much as I hated Jar Jar Binks (and that's saying I really hated them). The best example I can think of is the one where the child is playing with the computer saying she is a computer wiz. Or when Laura Dern and Sam Neill stare in desbelief at the first dinosaur in the movie. One can see in their eyes they are trying to be impressed by something they are trying to visualize, without much success. Talk about bad acting!I guess the day when someone decides to make an epic with CGI dinosaurs *without* facial expressions and voice, and where no humans are present, that will be the day a dino-flick will earn my '10' rating. As it is, JP earns a solid 8 on the basis of acting from the dinos.",5,3,10,31 July 2000
V for Vendetta," Awesome entertainment... and food for thought, too.
","Not having read the comic book (yeah, as if comic books had any literary value to start with! :) ), I enjoyed this movie immensely. I'd put it on par with the original Matrix - a movie where I really didn't know what was going on right until the end. I'd say it's '1984' for the 21st Century - a vision of a totalitarian government, and how one man struggled to make a difference.This movie polarizes viewers. I'd guess you could even 'guess' the political affiliations of people by asking them whether they liked this movie, or not. The fact that action sequences are handled in a very sensible way doesn't help, either. This is not a 'blow-em up movie' that is easy to like...All in all, an excellent movie. A must-own DVD.",9,2,5,26 March 2006
