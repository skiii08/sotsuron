Iron Man 3," Even Though Not reaching the heights of Iron Man 1 / Avengers , Still A solid start for Marvel's Phase 2
","I found the movie quite entertaining , there were some good performances by RDJ , Guy Pearce and Sir Ben Kinsley although the script could have been a bit better but the editing was crisp and to me there was never a dull moment in the film. The Action was superb , even though not touching the heights of Avengers it was still quite good and innovative. I could not understand the motive of the villain properly and it felt quite generic to me , which is a big minus point for me . The 'twist' was done in a funny and unexpected way and caught me by surprise . Talking about 3D , it was pretty non-existent and only a very handful amount of shots had depth . So, While it does not reach the height of Iron Man / Avengers , this Shane Black 's film is a definitive improvement over the dull Iron Man 2 , It has good amounts of comedy and one-liners but I think it was under the margin for me. I also expected it to expand the MCU and introduce or hint new characters and other films but it didn't happen . It is a very good, if not quite a brilliant start to Marvel's Phase 2.",8,1,9,28 April 2013
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," Best of Phase 2 , Age of Ultron has begun
","A solid Political Thriller , great addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe , best movie of phase 2 , I will not call it better than Avengers but it was around there . For me its the third best in the Marvel movies (behind Avengers and Iron Man) . The story was brilliant , other marvel writers should take some clues from here . Direction was great , Russo brother did an awesome job . Action was another solid aspect and showed that good action can still be done without huge CGI.On Acting front I think it was a step up , Chris Evans played Steve Rogers with heart and soul , Scarlet now looks and acts like Black Widow , Robert Redford , Anthony Mackie were fine in their roles . Sebastian Stan did all he could and was menacing as the Winter soldier . The Winter soldier arc was the only thing which I think was slightly weak in the movie but we will get more of Bucky in Cap3 . Samuel Jackson was just being Samuel Jackson .I think this was a right way to go in terms of story and characters . Looking Forward to Age of Ultron . (Guardains of Galaxy is not related to Age of Ultron).Do wait for the two credit scene , both are very good . The first one is more related to Avengers 2 , while the second is related to this movie.Until Then , HAIL HYDRA .",9,1,2,13 April 2014
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1," The Best Of Potter Films So far
","I went For the afternoon show of deathly hallows pt1 but not with great expectations... as one of my friend who watched it earlier didn't liked it much. But the opening sequences only thrilled me!!!The great Warner Bros logo came out with much improvement in animation. There were very good points - as they followed the book , The visual effects , the acting and the Nagini close in was very terrifying!!! The locket scenes were well done and I literally cried at Debby's death.Radcliffe did a pretty decent role as did Grint and Emma.Just wanted that they should have shown the death of Alastor 'Mad Eye' Moody. How could the have missed that!!!Other than that everything was fine.I wanted to give it 9.5 but it being a potter movie I couldn't resist. I can't wait for 15 July 2011 . All in all a must watch Movie!!! 10/10",10,1,3,21 November 2010
