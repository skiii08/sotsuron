The Lobster," This why we only listen to electro music.
","I love this quote machine of a masterpiece. This is very Kafkaesque, and done just right as a satire, instead of pictures such as 'Deep dark', which are very commendable, brave and fun, but tend to escalate into pure flimsiness and really rub it in your face how 'edgy' they are. No, the photography, directing and acting in this flick will keep you on the edge of your seat throughout. I myself see myself as an easily distracted guy, I must admit I tend to get a little bored by drama, but the subtle tone of this film, the comedy and absurdity of the human condition had my eyes peeled throughout the film. I dare already say one of the best films of this year. What I myself being a writer find most noteworthy in the interaction and dialogue is how the pressure of society get really obvious when they flip the script like they have done here; Our modern world WORKS JUST THE SAME, but instead of how things are in our modern real life society, the characters here do their very best to parade their perfect treats and are all painfully honest about their disadvantages, but also invent new ways to lie, when the stake is that society will turn them into beasts and leave them in the woods if they can not mate. Because, as they say 'two is obviously better than one, this is a reminder'. Every characters antics and actions makes perfect sense in this fully logical context, where even just standing alone by yourself in a shopping mall will not only be frowned upon -it will have dire consequences. A brilliant portrait, analysis and analogy of what loneliness is. Let this remind you of death. It won't get more fun and stylish than this.",9,3,7,8 February 2016
John Wick," Zero stars.
","Willem Dafoe is bad at aiming: So my guess is that this is some old stunt-friend of Keanu's who now directs his first full length feature and Keanu has simply agreed to help out. Because the directing is silly, the script is bad, the dialogue is laughable at best, the plot is weak, Keanu is as 'whoa' as always, the other actors are ludicrous, the characters are not believable, the hardrock guitars in every fight is cliché, and for me as a swede it is fun to see Mikael Nyquist in a film, but my guess is that he only got cast because his English pronunciation is so cheesy. If you want to see an awesome movie without a plot, solely based on constant fighting and violence that feels, go watch The Raid instead. This is quite possibly the worst film I have ever seen, and the first time I give anything zero stars. Not even a soundtrack featuring Marilyn Mansons weakest song to date saves this.",Null,5,17,13 January 2015
The Babadook," Warning: Don't have kids.
","This is a very realistic tale about a single distraught mother descending into madness since life just being what it is, through the eyes of her own and her child. I have seen this too many times in real life. I have seen this in, sadly, nearly every relationship around me, including my own horrible upbringing, which eventually led to both my father and my mother committing suicide in very messy ways. We're talking most of my friends, my own family, and as an example; this new girl that I'm seeing. She has a four year old daughter who is awesome, but she's stubborn and a piercing yeller, and had they not been brought into my life as well as I in theirs just a couple weeks ago, things would have gone horribly wrong. I've just met her, and we are still trying to work things out regarding her and her daughters safety from themselves. Don't have a family. Don't have kids. Don't create life because, as they say in this film, life will be very treacherous and circumstances will soon make you find yourself alone in situations which neither you, your friends or ANY government authority can handle. Why would you want to inflict the very pain of existence upon your own child, should you have one? Why would you want to create a family just to have something to do, to have someone to be accountable to, to create meaning of your own life. Creating life is a selfish act which has, will and do murder us all. It's not that you shouldn't be happy, go ahead be happy, have sex and lots of it and have fun. But be careful, because you are literally giving the child you will have all the horror it will experience. And prolonging the human race is not necessarily a reward in itself, because you haven't even figured out why YOU are in the first place, you haven't even figured out why existence IS in the first place, and all the nightmares it can provide your family with, should you have one. On the surface this is a horror story about a child's book. Great acting, scripting, direction, everything. And very creepy as well, without any jump scares. But at the end of the day, this is a warning. You shouldn't play god, no matter how safe you think you play. Because in 999999 times out of a million , this will happen. Parents projecting and passing on their own demons onto their children. Your children. I don't even have to promise you, just look around.",10,6,13,21 December 2014
It Follows," One of the best movies I have ever seen.
","This is as metaphorical as The Babadook, as paranoid as The Ring, and as hard hitting as Fight Club. I don't get scared easily, but this one was just as scary as Utopia, and as romantic as Amelie.I don't like scary movie soundtracks much, but this ones reminds me of Drive, and the one theme is as good as Silent Hill's.I have watched tons and tons of film, and this one is right up there along with Eternal Sunshine of a Spotless Mind.An homage to the director for bringing up such as bizarre, fascinating, an unexplainable phenomenon as Sex. I have myself written and produced many scripts, music and books on the same subject and from different angles (excuse the pun), some published, but I have always met opposition on many levels when trying to delve in and explain this phenomenon. Be it from financiers not daring to touch the subject or be it from horrified parents. I feel like the best piece of fiction in any medium ever ever ever has been done here, and so done is also my own work. A weight has been lifted off my shoulders and I can now find new horrors in modern society to try and shine light on. I can now find peace. Seriously, it is that damn good and important, this film.This one pulls of to describe teen-ridden angst while it is eerily sexy and scary as s**t at the same time.Great cast, great direction, great script, great subject, great angle, great f***ing film (pun intended).And for the horrified parents; this is probably the best prophylactic/cautionary tale.",10,41,84,2 June 2015
Get Out," a race to the race.
","Instead of spoiling anything, I just feel like telling you a story of mine considering race. I have myself been working with movies, and one experience I have is how I needed to find a better lighting guy. You see, as soon as we put a black person in front of the screen, the lighting guy just didn't know what to DO. It wasn't about race or anything, he just couldn't figure out how to make the lighting look good on any black actress. It just didn't work on screen. Now I have been waiting for this movie forever, and I am a white privileged man –however white trash-but I live in a racist underdeveloped country (Sweden, oh the irony) so I found it necessary this morning to just download a shitty cam version of it, and all I can think of is how beautifully lit it is even on a cam version, how the light reflects so well on those ebony bodies even in the dark scenes, their white teeth, their genetic frame and whoops we are back into race again. This movie is very subtle, but always constant, in its remarks on unconscious racism. The direction is ever so slightly off beat sometimes to be subtle, perhaps because it handles issues almost too absurd to handle,but it is truly on the top in the absurdist horror genre right up there with films such as It Follows, The Babadook, and Scream. What this film eventually does is asking the big questions, like where consciousness is even located, which made me respect the script even more. Big ups to Jordan Peele, I seriously didn't think he had this in him, except for the occasional brilliant Key and Peele sketches such as Lil' Homie. Give this nigga an Oscar already. Since these are big questions to handle it never gets too gory, and the slight nuances in the acting is superb. Catherine Keeners evil goddamn chuckle as we remember it from films such as Being John Malkovich is right on spot, and Dexter's sister is brilliant in voice control (the phone scene!). All this being said, there is a contraption men can wear nowadays that with small electrodes let you feel what it is like to have a vagina and go through a period. This movie is as close you can get (apart from wearing a blackface?) from understanding racial tension nowadays. An important and very entertaining movie. You got soul.",10,8,18,8 March 2017
In Time," At least Cillian Murphy is in it.
","If you watch this, you are going to watch a really cheesy movie, which I myself felt like watching at the time, so why not?But you were warned.Firstly, the script is actually really good, by an obviously talented screenwriter.Secondly, the director seems ambitious but completely fails to deliver, and I respect that though, there is not much to work with here, because of;Thirdly, in each and every shot of this movie Justin Timberlake makes a duck of himself as an actor in my opinion, and pretty much the rest of the cast is obviously ambitious, which I respect, but totally fails to deliver in exactly every shot. And then enter: Cillian Murphy. Always nice to have him given screen time. He pretty much makes the whole movie. Gotta love him.The rest is just not good, if you ask me. I did not have a pleasant viewing with my girl tonight. Probably wouldn't have by myself either.",1,0,4,29 March 2012
Up in the Air," Unbelievably horrible.
","This is a film full of characters that I absolutely despise in real life. I still watched it though, as I currently have no life and was reeeeeeally bored. Yes, I see the irony in that, as it is about people without a life laying other people off. This film is a self-fulfilling prophecy that way, as watching it will make its purpose come full circle. If George Clooney would have come up to me and said any line which he says in the movie, I would have punched him square in the face. You probably would have to out of reflex, if you have any dignity. Anna Kendrick's character acts like nothing but a helpless strumpet in this film, and Vera Farmiga's character is just bitter, uninteresting, hollow and miserable. There is nothing likable about any of these characters or even any of the environments they lay about in. Even the parties they go to in this film are miserable. I mean, the entertainment for the party is named Young MC. Who in the name of holy f*** would ever applaud anything called Young MC? They all talk like people I hate, they all look like people I hate and they all act like people other more consistent people usually would f*** in prison. There is nothing successful about these elitist misguided people. If I ever end up like one of them, I honestly pray to God that someone will throw me off a bridge. What in the lord's name is the point of this movie? Is it a warning? Is it the wake-up call George Clooney is referring to?",1,4,10,19 January 2014
