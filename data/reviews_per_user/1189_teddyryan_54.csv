The New World," Still Needs A Trim
","Terrence Malick never ceases to impress. In stride with his classic films, BADLANDS and DAYS OF HEAVEN, the director's ode to the Captain John Smith-Pocohantas saga is a staggering work of beauty. The performances by Farrel & Co are solid. And the work of newcomer (There's No Way I Can Spell Her Name) leads the way into a stunningly accurate portrayal of love, virtue, and the human spirit. Unfortunately, Malick's cinematic indulgences tend to grow tiresome towards the end of the film; and, it soon becomes obvious that Malick needed a 5th editor (I guess 4 won't cut it for this guy). Still, if you're willing to be mildly bored at times, THE NEW WORLD is quite a viewing.",8,0,3,25 January 2006

","SPIDER MAN 2 has great sound design.  Listen as our hero (Tobey 'The Greedy Blue Eyed' Maguire battles Doctor O (Alfred Molina) and gets tossed into walls and through cars and breaks lots and lots of glass.In fact, the sound is a true offspring of the mother of all action flicks: T2 (remember Arnie battling the T-100 and the amazing advances Jimmy Cameron and co made).SPIDER MAN 2 has dazzling effects.  Watch as he flies through the air and rescues the beautifully dressed Mary Jane Watson (Kiki Dunst).  Or saves her from a tumbling automobile (noticing a fascination with motor vehicles?).Finally, SPIER MAN 2 has a tremendous cast and crew.  Sam Raimi is a master of the visual eatery, while Maguire and Franco hold potential for an incredible show down.Unfortunately, like its predecessor, SPIDER MAN 2 has a stinky script.

Black Mass," Johnny The Wolf
","It has been the Fall of disappointing movies. BLACK MASS stands at the top of this list. Take one look at Johnny Depp as Whitey Bulger and you'll think his make-up artist had Tim Burton on a direct line. Nonetheless, I understand how BLACK MASS fell into the trap of becoming yet another poorly failed Goodfellas/Donnie Brasco. The life of one of the most infamous crime bosses is hard to discern - what is even harder to discern is the world that surrounds him. It's not truth versus fable. It's how do we explain the damn thing? From his heinous acts of legendary proportion, the real Whitey is known as one of the most ruthless/inhumane people to ever walk this planet. He was on the 10 most wanted list for the entire world before being captured by the FBI. There's some nasty buggers on there - so we get the drift. However, for most movies/TV shows to work, the audience has to have an affinity for the main character - it's the element that made The Sopranos such a smashing success. Do we even have the right to give Whitey Bulger the privilege? Yes - purely on dynamics, of course. His heart is black (no spoiler here, folks). Lets see how it beats - not just look at a dude dressed up like the Joker with a leather jacket. In my opinion, there are alternatives to create a more compelling story - but I didn't write the film or will claim to be able to pull it off myself. Although I might have had some objections with making Johnny Depp look like the Wolfman.Give me a strong story runner from TV and we might have some gasoline. David Milch, want to hop in the batter's box? We'll surely give you a bat. SPOILER* We're not asking for a documentary - we can't ask that of any fictional movie. But, we do want human moments that make us relate to the character - if at least for five minutes. And, where Goodfellas has Henry Hill in tears when asking his boss for money or Tony Soprano crying in therapy, Black Mass has a few mundane blasé scenes with his wife and mother - who checks out early on. In fact, every female character in the film is the same (except for the prostitute Whitey strangles played by the sultry Juno Temple).SPOILER* the one good scene Whitey purposely freaking out the FBI agents at dinner when discussing a homemade family receipt - this is in the trailer - which is why I wanted to see the movie. This is followed by Whitey paying a visit to Connolly's wife upstairs. He is terrorizing, horrifying, you name it - and he's actually dynamic here. Too bad this is five minutes amongst 122. Wait for this on HBO. Do not pay for it on demand. Seriously. Don't.",5,3,4,5 October 2015
Barry Lyndon," Old School Delight From Kubs
","Old Kubs is at it again. A man with the most insane set designs I have ever seen, he goes to 11 with his period drama BARRY LYNDON. With a wonderful performance by Ryan O'Neal (although it might have been a bad idea to have him play the younger Barry), a wonderfully paced screenplay, and cinematography that rivals the great T Malick, he rifles us with an epic story of fortune gained and fortune lost. This film contains some extremely poignant moments, perfectly orchestrated and brought to life by O'Neal. At over 3 hours, however, BARRY LYNDON does test your patience. Towards the end, its hard not to get frustrated with Kubs. Still, the climax of the movie is some of the most intense stuff I have ever seen (and I have seen a lot). I mean, the guy is on point, and I think this is perhaps his best work. We miss you, Stanely, and I'm always willing to forgive you for EYES WIDE SHUT. Tedder.",7,3,9,8 June 2006
Forrest Gump," Run To The Hills
","Iron Maiden lead singer Bruce Dickson once said, 'If you're gonna die, die with your boots on.'  I feel much same way about Bobby Z's FORREST GUMP.  A pure star vehicle for Tommy Gun Hanks.  He basically plays Jesus Christ without the ability to be a pacifist all of the time; which, I will admit, at times is touching.  Especially when he watches Jenny (Robin Wright Sean Penn) play guitar at a strip joint, mistaking the event for a legitimate concert, and then slugging the skum balls that harass her. 
I also praise this picture for not being preachy.  It deals with large chunks of American history and treats them objectively, letting us decide what really was going on during such turbulent times.  Gary Sinise is also a charm.  Unfortunately, huge parts of FORREST GUMP lack the firepower to keep us glued to the story.  As a result, we become bored and wonder when Bobby Z is ever going to have the guts to make a period peace that does not use the most cliched songs of all time.

Bridget Jones's Diary," boring
","BRIDGET JONES'S DIARY creates a world where sex, dating, and emotions are like a CD you broke.  Yeah, it sucks it's in three pieces but you can always get a new one at the store.  This kind of attitude in filmmaking creates a relaxed atmosphere for the audience and allows us to see society like a circus as opposed to acknowledging it as anything real.  SEX AND THE CITY carries the same objective and makes the trendy singles scene look fun, happening, and intriguing.  Unfortunately, if a filmmaker's goal is to obtain a recognition of truth, BRIDGET JONES and its cousin fall far off. Although casted well and executed in a cute summer reading fashion, the movie continuously catapults us into English bar set ups, where each member drinks heavily in order to create a comic event.  Therefore, when the director tries to create a poignant scene with sustinence, it takes off to what Keith Moon would refer to a lead zeppelin.",Null,1,2,21 June 2004

Bridge of Spies," Turkey Without The Gravy
","I am biased in my review of BRIDGE OF SPIES. The Cold War is my thing, always has been my thing. I am dazzled by that time in history: surveillance, the cars, CIA, Eisenhower, and the mystique of John Fitzgerald Kennedy. From the trailer of this film, I expected a delicious plate of Cold War atmosphere, intrigue, and commentary. Like a gleeful child, I sprinted to the movie theatre – expecting a non-pretentious high octane version of Mad Men. I anticipated my favorite era in history being served up like LET ME IN (a piece of 1980s period perfection elegantly directed by Matt Reeves).I held close the trailer as I landed my perfect middle seat in the theatre. The clips of a U2 Surveillance jet spiraling at 70,000 feet, children overflowing in tears as they watch a thermonuclear film strip, and Tom Hanks' face plastered to a subway window as we see guards firing at bystanders trying to climb over the Berlin Wall. Then you add Steven Spielberg to the mix – the master of the period piece – modern cinema - the evoker of our deepest emotions. One of my favorite Spielberg films is Munich. Munich captures the violence of the Middle East 70s with revere, respect, and revelation. This is what I wanted from Bridge Of Spies. I wanted a dark, harrowing portrait of the Cold War, I wanted this tense era exposed in Spielbergian fashion, and I wanted to have 1957-1961 ruminating in my heart, mind, and belly. Bridge of Spies, however, met none of my desired expectations. Diluted by a PG-13 rating, filled with comedic moments (clearly due to the Coen Brothers having written or participated in this script) that don't tickle my fancy, and an avoidance of Cold War atmosphere – Bridge Of Spies hit me like a tennis ball on the head. It's taught, adequately plotted, and the hero is smart, likable, and witty. It's garnered rave reviews. But, for anyone that likes substance, don't look here. Spielberg's story is a moral tale – of courage and standing up for one's ideals – the universal plot which Steven devours like a hungry child. Unfortunately, there's no stakes. Hanks follows his journey and does what he does best – but his universe is given little context. You'll want turkey and you'll get turkey – but you're not getting any gravy. **Possible Spoilers – Things that bugged me about the film was plethora of wasted opportunities. When you have Spielberg at the helm, you know what could have been – 1. The relationship between the Lawyer (Hanks) and the Soviet Captive (Mark Rylance) is an unbalanced paper weight. We get a glimpse into the Lawyer's character, the archetypal Tom Hanks - fair, honest, moral, etc. We get very little info on the Captive. He is quiet, dignified, and keeps responding to Hanks wondering if he is aware of his dire situation, 'Would it help?' Rylance is the typical Spielbergian 'caught in the middle guy' – much like Ben Kingsley in Schindler's List. Physically weak, trapped and powerless - yet stoic and unafraid. That being said, what are his motives? He is a spy but what drives him – where is the monologue where he explains his background, what formed and shaped him and what forms the basis of his lifelong goals?2. What I love about Mad Men is its strong focus on the media and culture of the era. Except for the end of Bridge of Spies (where we get a clip of Pierre Salinger informing the news of the spy swap) and an early scene of a teenage girl watching a late night story, there's not much to nibble on – Spielberg wastes a huge opportunity in a class room scene where kids are watching a nuclear bomb film strip. Lifting the film strip like a YouTube Clip and then showing a few generic shots of kids watching it and one girl crying - the master of modern cinema stumbles and falls into shallow surf. In this instance, I wanted to yell at the editor – build this up, let it seep in, give us some Wonder Years or Let Me In flavor. There's none to be had – 3. Not only do we get a vapid Francis Gary Powers – due to lackluster character development and the miscasting (in my opinion), but the U2 Surveillance storyline is about 12 minutes. Give me at least 25, Steven!! When the U2 is shot out of the sky, we get about a minute of action – give us three. In addition, because Francis Gary Powers has no character development, I don't sympathize with him or even care if he comes home. 4. The PhD student who is included in the Prisoner Swap is devoid of character – another guy that I could care less if he makes it home. Both guys appeared to have a lackluster indifferent time over the in the USSR. The Soviets dowsed Powers with water and German soldiers rip up the PHD students thesis paper – oh no!5. There is no discussion of the disastrous political implications of the U2 being shot down over the Soviet Union. Reluctant to authorize the mission, Eisenhower was smeared by its failure and left office of the President on a black cloud. However, we don't hear Eisenhower's name mentioned once in the story. All and all, Spielberg delivers a cup of vanilla ice cream with fudge – most audiences are going to love Hanks and the Soviet spy. In the final analysis, it's a buddy film with some period costumes and a somewhat poignant conclusion. That being said, those that want a stirring pot of fear, sadness, and elation – I suggest you wait for this on HBO and watch Munich instead. Ted's Personal Enjoyment: C+",6,108,187,19 October 2015
Cold Mountain," No chemistry kills the romance
","I'm not quite sure if it was bad casting or lazy writing.  Either way, the love story that runs through COLD MOUNTAIN is like ice on a pond: looks great from a far but don't dare tread on it.  Unfortunately, the film maker sinks deeply through the surface as the picture concerns itself with endless voice overs from Nicole Kidman to her love Jude Law.  Repetitive and filled with the same words, you start to wonder what would have happened, if they had just concentrated on the crazy union army and its cast of evil characters.  Nonetheless, Law does a wonderful job opposite Kidman with whom he has absolutely no chemistry.  Renee Zellwegger is a bit annoying but bearable.  The scenery is nice and the costumes cool (except for Kidman who looks like she's out of 1934 glamour magazine as opposed to 1864).",Null,4,11,26 July 2004

But, T3 does have great action scenes and incredible special effects.  And, aside from Claire Danes, its cast that holds up pretty well. 
Unfortunately, Kristina Loken's T-whatever-she-is cannot hold a candle to Robert Patrick's portrayal of the infamous T-1000.

","I had high hopes for COLLATERAL.  Being directed by one of my favorite filmmakers and featuring Tombo 'The Gun Guy' Cruise, I expected this picture to be the gem of the summer.  But, let me say: I was wrong.  Big time.  The script is weak, flustered by strangely bland moments and hampered by a cat and mouse affliction that never lived up to its afore mentioned promise. Cruise provides the depth for Vincent, a machine-like villain.  Nonetheless, Max (played by Jamie Foxx) dances both sides of the character line; at times, hating his captor, at other times, in confiding him.  I found the relationship to be terribly unrealistic.  As for the rest of the cast, their story lines are wasted and given little resolution.  As a result, I cannot recommend COLLATERAL.  Due to its lack of structure, heart, and narrative, it implodes into the LA nightlife it so highly wants to emulate.",Null,1,1,20 August 2004

","CITY OF GOD is a bit self-indulgent, a film that shuns on the gangster lifestyle yet always eager to promote it.  Martin Scorsese and Tarantino's influences run heavy in this nearly 3 minute saga about life in the slums of Rio De Janero.  As a result, it's hard to enjoy the subject matter as you're hit over the head with garish displays of a filmmaker gone wild. Nonetheless, the performances are top notch.  A group of unknowns perfectly execute the instability of teenagers with access to guns, drugs and money. In one instance, a gruesome scene seems so real, you want to turn your head.

","Not having worked on the picture or participated in any form of the production, I can only wonder what went wrong with 1998's MEET JOE BLACK. 
For me, the questions start with Pitt.  Why did he take on that dull persona I wonder?  Why did he insist on playing death like a dolt?  Also, why did he have that high lighted sunshine-puff-puff doo?  He injured the movie with blank looks and a lifeless stupidity, while giving his love interest (played by the delicious Claire Forlani) absolutely no reason to desire him.    Director Martin Brest (who suffered immensely at the hands of GIGLI) should have known that his lead actor would be box office poison.  As kind as genetics have been to Pitt, they have not endowed him the ability to portray the surreal.  Therefore, I would have suggested Jim 'The Jesus' Caviezal for the coveted part of Joseph Black.  In addition, I would have held back on the whispering voice overs that appeared more like severe editing errors than the magical messages they were intended to be.

Jurassic World," Pretty Dazzling - one small annoyance
","The Jurassic Park/World legacy is a staple of modern fiction. Michael Crichton's exploration of dinosaurs resurrected - the unveiling of man versus our most revered beast – is cinematic gold. Steven Spielberg did a masterful job with the original installment, Jurassic Park. This type of story was made for the master of adventure, wonderment, and spine tingling thrills. Steven stumbled on the sequel, hampered by a hokey script – but still delivered more creepy little foes from the prehistoric. The third lacks any compelling characters and is largely forgettable – although the unveiling of the Pterodactyl.JURASSIC WORLD is the fourth installment from Crichton's classic legacy.* JURRASIC WORLD is a homage to the original film sprinkled with a delicious dabble of current culture and technology. If you don't know the premise, the original Jurassic Park has now become a fully functional island resort run by a corporate conglomerate. Over 20 years later, it is now called Jurassic World. As opposed to the three previous stories, the island is filled with tourists and multiple attractions.Dig in. JURRASIC WORLD employs the classic plot points from Jurassic Park and a myriad of timeless horror movies – such as Aliens and The Birds. It's a tasty dish.The hero played by Chris Pratt is a young Indiana Jones – an adventurer living in the wild – adorned with the classic brown vest (although minus the hat). Bryce Dallas Howard is a high powered corporate employee that runs operations of the island. The Howard/Pratt relationship - the clichéd rugged hero matched with the high strung upper class beauty – works surprisingly well. Howard breathes life into the role of heroine. She avoids many dialogue/screenplay/character traps that could've nabbed another actress.The new director manages to hold the pressure and weight of the Jurassic universe. I give this guy props. Outside of yelling action on the set, I can't imagine the grace it would take to deal with the studio, multiple writers, and master of cinema, Spielberg himself. This newcomer has what it takes and the studio is reaping the benefits - he re-lit a giant franchise! It's the third highest grossing film of all time, I believe.SPOILERS *Any adventure movie requires suspension of disbelief. Spielberg has been aware of this since day one and carefully tows the line of fictional reality and fictional unreality.Unfortunately, The Jurassic World director screwed up an obvious detail – and it drove me crazy.Would any human being survive the rampage wearing a pair of high heels? Bryce Dallas Howard drops her fancy clothes, gets dirty, and dawns a Ripley tank top – yet does not remove her high heels throughout the movie!! This means she's sprinting from dinosaurs, explosions, and near death instances in a pair of high heels. This ridiculous problem could have been remedied easily. One scene of her working out at the park's fancy athletic facilities and keeping a pair of sneakers close by – that she throws on before joining in the rescue mission.Honestly, take one look at a woman walking to work through Manhattan in heels and then try picturing her escaping a velociraptor. This one details bothered me enough to give Jurassic World a B minus as opposed to a B plus.",7,6,14,2 November 2015

Sicario," Potential Hindered by Script
","SICARIO has the recipe for a delicious movie. You have the director of Prisoners, Benicio, Brolin, and a kick ass score. You provide drugs and a drug war - I am there. That being said, this movie has no climax and flat lines - another beautifully made clunker. The scenes waiver like a flounder off the coast of Baja.Instead of ending with a strong finish, Sicario does the reverse. You're gripping your seat at the beginning. By the end, you want out and/or are praying for a fix. I might give Sicario a 6 because the director threw the right ingredients into the chicken and his direction (shots and performances) is spot on - unfortunately, it collapses under the weight of a flimsy screenplay. I think this picture is on par with TRAFFIC (a movie that has great pieces but succumbs to the misguided written word). *SPOILER Personal opinion, I wish the Emily Blunt character was casted with a dude. The female portrayal by the writer is like a Clarice Starling on a bad batch of Tylenol PM.Josh Brolin must have lit the script on fire when asked to memorize one line. He improvises to such an extent, I started wondering if he knew the plot of the movie. Thank God he had some semblance of an interesting character to work with - I think he's enjoyable to watch.This is no fault of his own but due to circumstance. But, seeing Benicio in another drug flick is like seeing another Volkswagen Jetta with skis on the roof.",5,35,65,5 October 2015
Inside Man," Yeah, Spike!
","Although this Spike Lee Joint has more plot holes than a piece of Swiss Cheese, it's a pretty entertaining ride. Denzel (who I always think kicks ass) is a hard hitting negotiator who plays by his own rules. Jodie Foster and Christopher Plummer are slimeballs that are there for him to eat. Clive Owen is awesome as well. Not to mention, Spike is working off a great Hollywood script. And although he takes every opportunity to throw in his typical racial messages, and references to the Yankees and Mets, you can't help but dig the story and cast. One of the better recent Spike films. Far better than 25TH HOUR, which I found to be a complete catastrophe.",6,2,3,25 August 2006
Mystic River," Falls short
","MYSTIC RIVER had huge potential.  The storyline is tremendous, the characters complex, and the conclusion powerful.  Furthermore, Sean Penn's performance is Oscar worthy.  Nonetheless, I felt the picture fell short in many ways:1) The portrayal of Katie Marcum and her friends seems unrealistic (note the girls reaction to Sean's interrogation).  In fact, the writer and director never take enough time to explore the relationship between Katie and her father.  The one scene they shared together was not adequate.2) Mr. Eastwood had problems pacing the picture.  For example, the juxtaposition of Brenan Harris' grief directly after Jimmy's grief is awkward.  3) Issues of tone haltered the film.  Is this a mystery or drama?  At times, when we're following Sean and Whitey's investigation, it feels like we're watching an episode of CSI.  However, when watching Jimmy deal with his daughter's loss, the story shifts haphazardly.4) The portrayal of Sean's estranged wife is poorly done and insufficiently resolved.     SPOILER!!!5) After getting to know Jimmy's character (especially his background and rabid anger), I thought he would've killed Dave immediately instead of making him admit it.6) Jimmy's wife's final speech is senseless.  With the knowledge that her husband just murdered a close family friend and will probably go to jail for it, she seduces him with an erotically bizarre 'king of the land' speech.7) Although claiming to not be friends, Sean's indifference to Dave's death is incalculable.I haven't read Denis Lehane's original novel.  Therefore, I'm not sure if these issues are a result of the author, the screenwriter, or the director. Unfortunately, whatever the matter may be, I don't think MYSTIC RIVER deserved to be nominated for BEST PICTURE.",Null,0,0,4 February 2004
A Beautiful Mind," Oh Ron
","Ron Howard seems like a swell guy.  But, I can't help the feeling that Brian Glazer extorts money from him.   Anyway, this movie has its moments.  It also has Russel Crowe. Jennifer Connolly was good.  I'm not sure if she's better than Judy Dench or any of the other woman that were up for best supporting actress. A BEAUTIFUL MIND will keep your attention if nothing else.",Null,0,2,7 October 2002
Jaws," Number One
","JAWS Is my favorite movie.   It provides me emotionally with everything I could want.  It is like seeing a beautiful woman at a party, talking to her, and then realizing she would be the perfect wife, mother, and bedmate.",Null,0,1,9 October 2002
The Terminal," A true master
","THE TERMINAL is slick and fast.  It is a picture full of camera moves I could barely comprehend yet I knew were right.  Spielberg and Hanks deliver a delicious blend of comedy and drama, which, at times, is a bit preachy, but easy to forgive.  Set mostly in the same location, the master filmmaker keeps the energy at eleven.  Even when he's delving into his cheese vat, I enjoy watching what this man has to offer.  As a result, I recommend THE TERMINAL highly.  It is the work of a director at the top of his game. Unlike A.I. or HOOK, Spielberg stays away from the mundane glow of carnival lights and provides us with content.  Keep going, wild one, your work is gold!",Null,0,1,12 July 2004
Vanilla Sky," no go
","On a rainy December night, more than a year ago, I piled into my local cinema to watch the latest film from legendary Cameron Crowe.  When I left, however, the only thing I wanted was my money back.  VANILLA SKY is a disaster in every essence of the word.  It shows what can happen when Tom Cruise gets his arms around a director and forces him to make a star vehicle. The whole dream/reality was far too much for a rock journalist turned filmmaker.  And although Crowe has talents in other genres, this one made him look foolish and grossly misguided.  The only thing I really wanted to say was, 'Get the led out.'",Null,1,2,7 January 2003
Trainspotting," fantastic!
","TRAINSPOTTING is fantastic.  One of the Top 10 Films of the 1990s.  Danny Boyle crafts a near flawless picture with the help of top actors and an incredible soundtrack.  In fact, next to Johnny Boy's entrance at the bar in MEAN STREETS, the hospital scene in this picture employs the best use of pop music in film.

Signs," Junior The Howling Idiot
","SIGNS is certainly creepy.  And M Night S-Dog has his hands all over the suspense.  Yes, he can make a grandly entertaining film like Spielberg. 
Also, this picture forshadows the next great actor of a generation, the dazzling Rory Culkin.  Nevertheless, M Night S-Dog's form is sloppy and his dialogue a bit weak at times.  And let me pose this question to the up and coming auteur whose face recently graced the cover of Newsweek.SPOILER!!!!!!!!!What would've happened to the Aliens if it had rained?  They certainly would've died.And ain't it a little wierd that this race had traveled across the stars yet they couldn't open doors???Just some food for thought.",Null,1,2,7 January 2003
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Yeah
","Pete Jackson has come along way from his first picture BAD TASTE. Nonetheless, his love of filmmaking is awe inspiring to all of us. Especially those that have witnessed the trilogy.  As result, I'm more than happy to grab my sword, raise my arm, and declare, 'Today we fight.'",Null,0,0,27 January 2004

There was some great stuff in this film.SOME POSSIBLE SPOILERS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Michael Mann knows how deliver that Sonny Crocket flavor.  Here's some examples. --Val Kilmer talking about his wife: 'the sun sets and rises with her.'  And, of course, we're looking out as dawn breaks over the Pacific. --A vintage Miami Vice theme plays when Pacino encounters DeNiro. --Yes, and then they finally meet.  Bobby D and my man, Al.  A friend of mine raves about this scene incessantly. --Don't worry.  Al does plenty of voice raising. --Al fishing his stepdaugher out of the bathtub.  She's just slit her wrists.

The Thin Red Line," a masterpiece

The Great Escape," Wonderful
","At first, THE GREAT ESCAPE seems like your normal 1960s war flick. However, as the picture progresses, it ends up being a heart wrenching tribute to POWS and their attempts to find freedom.  A masterful piece.Ted's Grade: A",Null,6,11,19 December 2003
Gangs of New York," far from great
","GANGS OF NEW YORK suffers from a confused script.  Giving us characters that make absolutely no sense.  Let me explain, and you might able to see why this movie is such a load of dung.SPOILERS!!!1) If Amstredam (DeCaprio) is so intent on getting revenge for his father's death, why does he spend an entire year helping the Butcher (Day Lewis) build his empire instead of killing him the second right from the get-go?2) Why does the Butcher have such respect for the man he killed when he is clearly an evil goat that has no sense of loyalty whatsoever?  I mean, watch him throughout the picture.  His motivations are always conflicting.  And especially in that beginning battle scene with Valmont.     
Just a personal note: The entire saga ends with U2's 'The Hands That Built America.'  But I honestly hope no one believes warring gangs and extreme violence are the true foundations of this great country.",Null,0,1,22 February 2003
Donnie Darko," A GEM
","Don't read the box for this film.  It is terribly misleading. What DONNIE DARKO really does is mix THE WONDER YEARS with DAVID LYNCH.  And, the result is spectacular.  The only person I know that didn't like the movie was my little sister.  And, she claims that CRAZY/BEAUTIFUL changed her life.",Null,2,4,7 October 2002
Born on the Fourth of July," Pretty darn impressive
","Stone does well.  Cruise delivers like I've never seen.  So much better than his sloppily suited Cameron Crowe collaborations or banal joints with Spielberg.  The script is absolutely delicious.  The scenes with Willem Dafoe are incredible.  The two of them screaming at each other on a lost Mexican highway, stuck in wheel chairs.  Wow.  John Williams provides a hauntingly fallen score.  The echoes of a trumpet as Ron returns home are painfully accurate.  And when he comes home drunk, your heart truly breaks. Out of all Stone's biopics, BORN ON THE FOURTH OF JULY seems to be the most relevant.  A well orchestrated piece of cinema from a director in his prime. Check it out and forgive ANY GIVEN SUNDAY; people make mistakes.",Null,0,1,19 July 2004
