The Avengers," Holy Mother God Almighty! What a film!
","The Avengers is truly a film that should be considered an instant classic. Joss Whedon does more than do justice to getting four superheroes on the screen, but he makes a tremendous yarn to go with it. Yes, the greatest strength of the film is the screenplay. The one liners are a keeper, and it comes with some great performances as well, particularly with Robert Downey, Jr and Mark Ruffalo. The film entertains in action, succeeds in comedy, and manages to be one of the greatest films we're bound to see this summer, and potentially one of the best films we'll see of the year. And an end note, if you do a sequel, please keep Joss Whedon. Without him, expect The Avengers 2 to be less entertaining overall.",10,11,22,14 July 2012
Men in Black 3," The men in black are back and still fun
","As a young child I watched the first Men in Black countless times and remains to this day one of the most fun films that has remained with me. The second one was nothing special, and after a ten year-absence, the MIB return. I was surprised to see just what approach the film took: make it fun, entertaining, and also a little heartfelt. As a second sequel to a film, that's exactly what it should be. One last point to make: Josh Brolin should really be considered for a nomination for Best Supporting Actor after such a realistic performance as a younger version of Tommy Lee Jones. A great third film that was quite better than it should have been.",9,1,3,14 July 2012
Iron Man 2," A sequel that could have been much better
","Coming off of one of the better Marvel films to date, Iron Man 2 is an OK film, but I expected a lot better. With Robert Downey, Jr., arguably one of the more popular actors in the world today, in the starring role, why wasn't the writing up to par this time? Yes, it may be said that the first Iron Man revamped Downey, Jr's career, it was notably because the writing was up to his performance, which was good, by the way, and the sequel is more worried about being an action movie and introducing new villains, allies, and trying to be funnier, which eventually becomes one of the more tiresome elements of the film. That being said, the film's action is quite satisfying, especially the last scene with the kind of robot war that happens. Unfortunately, it's the only good one. Otherwise, the party scene is reminiscent of Spider-Man 3's dance scene, and the Justin Hammer character is unnecessary and unfunny, but the film hits a few good spots, and it recovers.",6,0,1,16 July 2012
The Hunger Games," This could be the next Harry Potter
","While I haven't read the books and barely knew any of the characters names before going into this film, I was massively entertained by it. As a matter of fact, when I first saw the trailer, I flashed back, coincidently, to my first time seeing the first Harry Potter movie trailer. And I said the same thing I said then: I'd see that in a second. The film's best aspects are the performances. Jennifer Lawrence delivers a nomination-worthy performance, Woody Harrelson does the same, and everyone else was great as well. As for the rest of the series, let's hope that without even the great Gary Ross directing, they can be as good as this one was, and yes, I think the credit should go to him, a great director.",9,2,6,14 July 2012
The Amazing Spider-Man," Good, but not great rendering of Spider-Man
","I was in my first year of school when the first Spider-Man film from 2002 was released. Since then, it has remained to be one of my favorite superhero films. The second one only got better, but the third just stank from start to finish. Coming off of that, a re-boot seemed to be the only way to go, but of course they made it too early. It's only been ten years since the first from 2002. That's my main complaint: the film decides to retell the origin story when I'm sure most of the audience remembers the first film. Aside from that, the acting is surprisingly good, the villain is pretty good, and the action doesn't disappoint. Just a couple dumb moments, otherwise a welcome re-boot that makes me want to see more, but please make it better.",8,1,2,14 July 2012
Quantum of Solace," Bond is back...but it's not his best
","Daniel Craig returns as James Bond in this 22nd outing for 007. The last film, Casino Royale, was so fresh in its darkness, original storytelling, and overall rooting of James Bond so we see how he got to the way he is. Quantum of Solace throws all of that out the window and declares itself an action picture, with only a few links here and there between the two films. What works is the film is it's sometimes pretty good writing, but not without its flaws. The major complaint: the tacky, sublime, ordinary villain to the piece. I thought the performance was OK, but it's just the writing that makes him so bad. Yes, I agree, the writing isn't what makes Bond films, but here it's the film's greatest strength, yet it's biggest weakness. Craig is good, the action is well done, but that's all I have to say about this one.",6,0,0,15 July 2012
Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol," This mission should be accepted
","Tom Cruise's career has been down almost every road it seems, and yet the best road he has ever gone down is the action picture road, and his most successful has been the Mission: Impossible franchise. While I haven't seen any of the other films, I was very impressed by this one. The film has everything you need: comedy, action, suspense, a good plot, and well done performances, which is actually rare for an action film. The only complaint I have is the villain. Not only do we get maybe five minutes of screen time with him, but his motives seem a little questionable and he overall comes off as extremely weak. But the positive of that: we get to know the four team members very well and like each of them and hope they all accept their next mission, which I definitely will.",9,1,2,15 July 2012
Rise of the Planet of the Apes," Quite a good reboot
","After the disastrous Tim Burton remake of Planet of the Apes, a reboot seemed a little unnecessary, but after watching it, I realized that it actually seemed to be not just a good idea to continue this ever popular franchise that I feared was going to be in the dark forever, but it was smart filmmaking. James Franco stars as a scientist who's father, Jon Lithgow, suffers from Alzheimer's, and he rapidly tries to create a cure, but after testing it and it supposedly works on a chimpanzee, the mother goes crazy before the cure can be patented and financially supported and the offspring, who has the benefits of this drug as well, becomes Caesar, who in the fourth film in the original series, led the Conquest of the Planet of the Apes. The film's special effects, while they sometimes look cheap, do the trick, aided by a tremendous performance by Andy Serkis doing motion capture as Caesar, and a thrilling ride once the apes get loose and rise.",9,1,2,16 July 2012
Men in Black II," Not a sequel, a remake
","Where the first film was original, the sequel makes it bland. I really don't consider this a sequel, but a remake. I hate sequels that do this: unoriginal sequels that would rather repeat the original's plot with one twist or two. Yeah, I know, the film has a couple good elements: Rip Torn scores a few laughs as Zed, and Will Smith still gets me laughing, but everything else is so unoriginal or bad that I have to get it out of the way, in a top 5: 5. Patrick Warburton as an agent in the beginning was ripped straight out of the first film and doesn't work. 4. Johnny Knoxville as a supporting villain. Are you kidding me? 3. The return of Jeebs is bad. 2. The stick aliens. Too much, way too much. 1. Frank the talking pug. Don't even get me started with two second joke that goes on too long.",3,0,2,15 July 2012
Men in Black," Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones=greatness
","Back in 1997, the world was entranced by this film. It was a huge hit, and deserved every bit of its success. And the reason is obvious: it's fun to see the straight-faced Tommy Lee Jones up with the always smirking Will Smith. The plot may be simple, the subplots may seem a little contrived and unnecessary, but the duo are so funny that they make up for any small flaw the film has. And perhaps the very best parts of the film are the Oscar-winning make up and special effects that back then were not only convincing, they were special. And that's the one combination that hardly ever works: sci-fi extreme and comedy. And simply but, this film does this the best since Ghostbusters.",9,0,0,15 July 2012
Dark Shadows," Not great, but worth a watch
","Tim Burton's career has been kind of all over the place. Recently his last film, Alice in Wonderland, wasn't anything to get excited about, but this was a welcome return to form, if he ever had one officially, for Burton. The best part of the film is Johnny Depp having a great time in the role of the vampire Barnabas Collins. Eva Green also does well as the witch who cursed him. The film has flaws however with its uneven tone, not quite balanced between comedy and horror. Just a closing note: I thank the film for the Carpenters references and the montage featuring Top of the World. Thanks for resurrecting the Carpenters when they had seemingly disappeared from the modern culture.",7,1,3,14 July 2012
Back to the Future Part II," Back...to the dance we've seen before
","Back in late 1989, Back to the Future Part II was one of the most expensive films ever made. Now that I've said that, let that set the tone of the film. The film is good-looking, and a lot of that comes from the budget, an estimated forty million dollars. And when I say good-looking, still seeing the futuristic Hill Valley today still looks amazing, even though it was 1989. The plot, on the other hand, relies on repeating the third act of the first film over again. But it has fun with it, so it's somewhat forgivable. But where the film really shines is in it's writing, especially with the one-liners, the long over-complicated speeches and warnings from Doc, and of course, Biff's screen door on a battleship line. While yes, the film is much weaker than the original, and it seems to take a little bit to get going, it's still a very visual sequel worth watching.",8,1,2,15 July 2012
The Dark Knight Rises," A different movie from The Dark Knight, but it was meant to be
","I'm tired of everyone comparing this film to The Dark Knight, because the entire trilogy is different every movie. Begins is about turning fear into an ally. Knight is about chaos and how to deal with it. Rises is about why building up on a lie has consequences. Yes, it may be noted that each film is darker and darker, with this one being possibly a downer of a summer movie, but then again it's nice to see a difference from the almost flashiness of The Avengers, nothing against that film, but with a darker tone and mood, it's a bit more interesting. Christian Bale gives his best performance yet. Tom Hardy does excellent, Anne Hathaway blew me away, and Michael Caine gives his best performance in years as Alfred. The action scenes are well executed, the twists in the plot are great, and the whole last act just gets better and better. Nothing this summer can top The Dark Knight Rises.",10,2,7,20 July 2012
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," Indy Jr. and Sr. make up for Temple of Doom
","Indiana Jones rides again in this third adventure, and it is the most enjoyable of the three. Though I do think the first film, Raiders of the Lost Ark, is slightly better, this film sure does have its spots. One of the most enjoyable moments of the film is the scene in Venice. The boat chase is well staged, the hunt for Sir Richard's tomb is well crafted, and the rats are fun. But by far some of the greatest stuff in the film are the action scenes. From the opening chase to the race to the exit from the earthquake at the end, the film's action scenes are some of the best I've seen in a late 80's film. But then again, the end truck chase in Licence to Kill hasn't been topped. And of course I must mention Sean Connery. What a great performance worthy of a nomination, though of course he didn't get one. Indiana Jones should be fun at the movies, and that's exactly what this is.",10,1,2,15 July 2012
Jurassic Park," Adventure 65 million years in the making, but it actually only took about 3
","Steven Spielberg's Jurassic Park is his best original film, and by original I mean not a sequel, since Raiders of the Lost Ark. And what a film it is, and it takes a director like Spielberg to make this more than an animals gone bad special effects film, but adds in the human characters that make it exciting. When it comes to C.G.I., these effects, though primitive, are some of the most effective and well done I've seen even to this day. And do you know why? Because the dinosaurs are, in the story, almost computer generated themselves. Therefore, it's appropriate that they seem a little fake, because after all, they are not real, real dinosaurs. I must say, the human characters, played by Sam Niell, Laura Dern, Richard Attenborough and so on, are good, with the best being the almost childish at times Jeff Goldblum, who of course came back for the sequel, and it's fun to have some humans to identify with along with the mindless, yet tremendous special effects.",9,0,0,16 July 2012
