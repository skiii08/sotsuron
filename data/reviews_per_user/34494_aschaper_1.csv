Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Disappointing Sequel to a Fantastic First Part
","Many of the film buffs I talked said that they liked this film I however, did not.I was disappointed by all the romantic talk. I wanted more flights of fancy, but seeing everything brought down to a level of human-ness took away from the magic and fantasy that filled 'Kill Bill Part 1.' It seems strange that QT would get soft on his story of revenge and his viewers. I was not particularly impressed with David Carradine's final scene in the film, either. Too cerebrally, not fantastic enough.I also did not like how Elle Wood kills Bud, when I would have preferred to see 'Beatrix Kiddow' get the job done.Despite my disappointment with the film as a whole, I did like the scenes of 'Kiddow' on the mountains with the white-haired guru. I think those flash-back sequences were the highpoint of the film.",6,0,1,13 January 2005
