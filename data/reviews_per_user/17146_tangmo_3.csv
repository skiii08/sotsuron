Hereditary," Not scary at all, boring and at the end becomes extremely ridiculous.
","I really wonder... when they first read the story, if they really said 'oh wow this is great, let's make a movie, people will love it'. How can someone like this movie seriously unless they are 8 years old.There is no twist. There is nothing to make you scared. Nothing intriguing other than wondering how bad it can get. Trust me it exceeded my expectations on that. The only good scene was the accident and I genuinely thought that the movie was gonna be great right that moment where he was sitting on the wheel. Such a shame I was wrong. Why is it difficult to make a good movie? Why always go for supernatural stuff when you can easily freeze people's blood with real things? After all that if it turned out that she has a mental problem because of her mom and unwanted pregnancy it could have been a much better movie.Toni Collette was quite good as usual. She delivered the pain, fear and desperation. However everything else was just embarrassment.That's 2 hours I can never get back.",1,6,13,24 June 2018
The Fault in Our Stars," Tells you that it is sad but not feeling it.
","There are some songs just say 'I love you'. There are some songs make you feel the love. This movie is doing the first one. In the movie, there are many scenes were supposed to be really sad and I am usually sensitive about those scenes. However forget the tears I didn't even feel sad at all. If you do things right you don't need to burst in tears to make the audience sad; even a look would be enough. They said 'That's the thing about pain. It demands to be felt.' Well, I'm sorry but I didn't.For the ones who don't agree with me I recommend to watch 'My Sister's Keeper' and 'Don't Worry I'm Fine (French movie)'.I gave 4 stars because at least I was able to watch the whole thing.Cheers!",4,0,1,9 October 2014
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," Disappointment... It could have been better. (Spoiler alert!!!)
","First of all there's a spoiler, so if you haven't seen the movie yet, don't read this.Before I saw the movie I was very excited but the trailer had given some idea that it wasn't gonna be how I expected. Unfortunately I was right. I can't say anything for acting. The story was interesting too, but typical Hollywood found a nice story and just exaggerated it. The movie is too long and after all that waiting you don't get anything in the end. The idea was interesting like I said, but the movie was all that, nothing more. I couldn't believe that he became a baby at the end of the movie. I'm not saying that it was a bad movie, but it doesn't deserve 8.3 rating. I gave 7 for good acting and different idea. Would I want to see it again? I don't really think so.",7,3,5,16 February 2009
