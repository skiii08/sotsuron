Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Why did it all go wrong. (possible spoilers)
","I really enjoyed Vol 1, so I waited for Vol 2 with great anticipation.  I have been sadly let down.  This film is a trip into Mr T's self indulgent mind. There are far too many monologues along with unecessary scenes.  The opening at the church.  This was not needed, we knew what happened from the first film.  We didn't need it repeated in slow and boring detail without seeing the actual blood bath that ensued.  As Uma is meant to be the ultimate female assassin, how did she fall for the oldest trick in the book at Bud's trailer???  Anyone with commonsense knows you fling the door open but don't fill the space.  For an assassin she was particularly thick. Once in the casket we have to endure yet another flash back to explain how she breaks out.  Any martial arts fan will know, we don't need a somewhat tedious flashback.  She has already proved a skilled warrior in the martial arts in the first film.  Which brings me to the master.  So he falls to poison fish heads. :rolleyes:  For a master that is trained and highly skilled in mind and body control, he doesn't notice the poison!  Bud - He is meant to be a psychotic nutter.  So why does he let himself get pushed around at the titty bar???? The trailer - a Black Mamba is on the loose, but the girls don't seem to care.  I was expecting a major sword fight, didn't happen.  Quite unexpected eye gouge. I appreciated the link with the master.  We get long boring segments with Uma and Bill.  Playing the flute while she lies in front of the fire.  Bill's monologue about Superheroes.  Yes, we get it.  But please, it could have been quicker.  Which leads to the climax.  For someone who has so much hatred and anger and someone with so much to lose, I was expecting a huge climactic battle between the two foes.   No, just a little clever sword play and the exploding heart combo. Sad letdown. Where was the drawn out suffering for Bill that he showed to Bea. 
  Basically Vol 1 should have been an hour longer with the same tight script with the action continue to flow.  Instead we get Vol 2 which Tarantino has had to bloat, destroy and slow down. A real shame.",4,4,8,25 April 2004
Troy," Very Good.
","This was a superb film.  It is 'Inspired' by Homer, not based on the poem.  Some have complained or criticised it for not being accurate.  It did not intend to be.  As an action / hack and slash film it is simply brilliant.  The castings are all very well chosen.  Brad Pitt was in amazing condition, his years of training had obviously paid off.  Eric Bana also commanded the screen when he was focused on. Orlando Bloom as Paris always had me chuckling when he was trying to be manly and a warrior, simply too pretty and so was also well cast.  I liked the twist on the cause of Achilles demise.  A woman can truly bring a man down.  Even one who is supposed indestructible.I thoroughly enjoyed the film and look forward to the DVD release.",9,3,6,25 May 2004
