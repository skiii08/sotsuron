Walk the Line," I fell into a burning ring of fire.....
","What an absolutely marvellous movie! Packed with the truth about Johnny as only his son can tell it, with some awesome performances (but they could have done a lot better for Elvis) Phoenix and Reece demonstrate amazing singing talent, making the soundtrack worth the cash even if you haven't heard Johnny's original versions!!! I really felt Johnny's love for June from the very start and felt a surge of relief for him when it all finally came together. Admittedly you will want them to get together so much that at times this film will feel like it is dragging, but still you will enjoy this film then leave the cinema singing out loud!",9,0,0,9 February 2006
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," Don't expect sugar and spice
","As a true Potter addict, this is by far my favourite of the three. But don't expect any nice sugariness as we saw in the first two. With Columbus gone, we are left with the darker effects of Mr Caurons direction, which makes for a more grown up and serious Harry Potter. Viewers will note that the pictures might seem a bit cold and blue and that some of the original set has been moved around, just some little touches added by Cauron. Gone are the cheesy lines from the first books such as Harmiones obsession with Harry's broken glasses. The young actors seem far more at ease with themselves in the skin of their characters, showing greater maturity and understanding. You will also notice the humour that comes under the hand of Cauron. The new soundtrack, again by master of film scores John Williams, is very different from the often repetitive music from the first two films in the series, not as catchy but more devisive. Fans of the book will not be disappointed with this reproduction, but be warned that some scenes are a little disturbing, even for some sensitive adults, and not all children will be impressed. If you are lucky enough to have your hands on the DVD, don't forget to check out the extras disc for some truly entertaining moments with the Shrunken Head, engaging interviews and fun games.",9,0,1,23 August 2005
The Incredibles," Wow
","Pixar fan? You will love this. It makes Toy Story look amateur. The Incredibles sees Pixar step it up a gear with even more complex shapes and textures (which left me in awe of computer aided design) and the story is just great fun. Holly Hunter is so convincing as the worrying mum and the baby is actually quite adorable! I was left in stitches at times in this movie. It has all the humour of Finding Nemo and A Bugs Life yet it still leaves you hovering on the edge of your seat with anticipation. I especially found the character Edna hilarious- all the characters fit their stereotypes so well and yet they add to them too. But beware Disney fans. This partnership with Pixar looks to be making classic Disney animation a thing of the past and I for one miss those days- Beauty and the Beast was just as much fun for me. The 3D may be exciting and fascinating, but it leaves you wondering if Disney is dying on us.",Null,0,0,23 August 2005
The Boy in the Striped Pajamas," I couldn't disagree more- a disturbing but BRILLIANT film if you consider who's behind it
","As a media student and avid follower of film, I have always believed every so often some of the more disturbing ones need to be seen by everyone to remind them of their humanity and put things into perspective.I have just returned from watching 'The boy in the striped pyjamas' and I wont give away too much only to say that it was most likely the most upsetting and disturbing film I have ever seen and that is truly saying something. Some of the things I have seen would horrify my mother. Still, go and see it.I wont give away too much of the plot here but I was left sobbing and shaking and actually couldn't get up at the end.David Thewlis has always inspired me as an actor; he seems to choose roles that don't always appear to suit him at first. This one, a Nazi commander, must have been immensely difficult to produce but he manages it. The way he is so brutally cold- there is truly nothing behind his eyes. Even with his children it is hard to see the fatherly love. He is, just as his wife says, a monster. In the end I fought hard to see any good in him. This is the let down at the end- even in the face of such tragedy he acts more shocked than horrified, not quite the way a parent would react.His wife on the other hand (played wonderfully by Vera Farmiga) is constantly believable eventually going mad at the thought of her husbands barbarity and the way in which it is warping the minds of their two children.The camera work could have been put to better use- this was a wasted chance for some exploratory shots. There is use of shake and zoom to give us a feeling of connection with the characters (especially with young Schmuel) but why not low angle to show a loss of power? Same goes for the sets. Here was a chance to be very dark and daring with buildings (the most striking of which is the 'Nazi' house which reeks of evil in civil clothing) but the stairs to the chamber just weren't symbolic enough for me of the terror awaiting within.You want confusing characters? Kotler is your chap. Reduced from power crazed mad Nazi terrorist to weak and pathetic in less than a scene and then back again. I was utterly terrified by him; there were times when my hand raised to my mouth after his mouth opened to speak.All in all, considering the BBC had so much to do with it, I left wondering how on earth this only got a 12 certificate. If I was a parent I don't think I would be sleeping tonight. Scratch that- even knowing I'm not a parent I may not sleep anyway.",8,16,29,17 September 2008
Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix," Not as good as the other ones
","I have heard people complain about how the film cuts from the book, but this time it is a bit more obvious. However, for nearly 3 hours it obviously has to cut some of it. The bit that makes this film a let down is the death of Sirius Black. It was short and very very poorly done. Even an interesting bit of editing (slow motion reaction kinda thing) didn't save the audience from disappointment. HELLO THIS MAN WAS THE ONLY PERSON HARRY HAD LEFT WHO WAS LINKED TO HIS LOST PAST. Ten seconds of screen time doesn't not do this tragic turn of events justice. For those who complain about the adult nature of this film, it is not the kiss that is the problem, as this is quite tame really- but it is so much darker than many of the others. Remember- this is NOT a children's story anymore. This is more a adult/teen thing now. It may not be suitable for any respectable parent to take a child less than ten along to see it. Special effects- nothing notable really. Shots- beautifully done. Cuts from the book- far too many. However, YOU WILL STILL LOVE IT!!!!",Null,0,0,2 August 2007
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," The Boy Who Lived becomes Legend
","This film is truly remarkable. Fabulous clean edits, good use of colour, a brighter and more cheerful look than the last, but a dark story all the same. It deserves its 12a rating, as there are some scenes that even I found disturbing. Fiennes Voldemort is truly terrifying, but harder still it is to see Cedric Diggory die. Moving most of all is the scene in which Harrys parents come back to him in a beautiful vision, the moment at which my eyes watered! This film has everything- romance (cho was very well cast and Likable), edge of your seat thrills (the maze) and heart wrenching sadness. All the actors have come of age, including character Harmione who has stopped whining (appears that in this film, thats Rons job). JK will be delighted to see the book so well framed, but a word of warning to fans of the literary Potter- there's no Hogsmeade and very little Sirius... for he is star of the next movie. This installment of the saga will go down as the greatest, mark my words. Simply beautiful.",10,1,2,17 November 2005
War of the Worlds," Creepy but clever
","Tom Cruise and Steven Spielberg are made for each other. Their last pairing on 'Minority Report' was a match made in heaven, a gripping and engaging film. This is no different. Tom is pushed into the shadows by the truly talented Dakota Fanning (Hide and Seek)and he never quite convinces us that hes a careless layabout. Spielbergs directing is a sensation, with plenty of choppy editing and explosive special effects, but at many times the plot line is lacking and you are left feeling you might have missed something. The soundtrack isn't anywhere near as gripping as the original, but the narration, by none other than Morgan Freeman, pulls you right into the action. For those who haven't read thebook, the ending is a revelation leaving you in awe that something so simple can have sure dire consequences, and you will laugh that it had such a massive impact. Overall, the CGI is spectacular, the acting is only average, the plot is a little gappy, but this is a film for any action addict.",Null,0,1,23 August 2005
Fantastic Four," Its been done before
","Fantastic Four follows very closely in the footsteps of the previous modern comic book remakes- the recent Batman Begins and Spiderman. The CGI is great with some rather awesome explosions and dramatic occurrences. What lets it down is the rush of it. By the end one feels like the story has been pushed too fast to meet with the time is it alloted. The decisions the characters face seem too quickly resolved to be real and the baddies demise is too stereotypical and speedy. The ending is just wayyyy too predictable, opening it to that sequel most people can see coming. See it if you like comic book remakes. Don't see it if you are expecting something new.",Null,0,1,23 August 2005
