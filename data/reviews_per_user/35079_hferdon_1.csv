It," I'm thankful I didn't pay money for this in the theater
","I just watched the original It from 1990, and that was pretty good, considering some parts were a little hokey, but all in all a pretty good film I might buy later. This remake... I don't think I can say the same. I only watched the first 45 minutes, and then turned it off because I immediately felt uncomfortable and sick to my stomach. I understand that Pennywise is an alien that comes every 30 years to feed on the children to survive, but from what I saw of the first 45 minutes, they made It too graphic and gory. It's one thing to know that Georgie gets killed by It, but it's traumatizing to see Georgie try to crawl away from the storm drain on a knub of an arm... That gave me the complete sick feeling and uncomfortableness. The whole thing with Beverly getting picked on by a girl at school, in my opinion, was not needed and completely annoying, and the whole Michael having to kill lambs for his uncle's meat shop was COMPLETELY uncalled for. We all know that us humans eat animals, but we don't want to see animals get shot and killed, which made me feel completely uncomfortable and sick again!! AND, last but not least, I know that the guys encountered the bullies, which is expected, but I didn't think that Henry would go as far as ACTUALLY carving into the kid's stomach, I thought it would be the same as the original in the sense of he kicked Henry and then fell back before actually being touched by the blade, which made me also feel uncomfortable and sick. Do you guys see a pattern!?!?!?!? I don't like these certain parts because they made me feel very uncomfortable and sick, and that's not something I want from a movie. So, if I had to choose between It 1990 and It 2017, I would definitely choose the 1990 version hands down!",3,1,2,27 June 2018
