Whip It," love it
","this movie is quirky and exciting - i loved it so much i watched it several times and now look forward to adding it to my permanent collection i would definitely recommend this movie to anyone wanting to bust out of the rut of 'top 10' releases. i watch a whole lot of movies, and sometimes they all start to just blur in together - like yeah that was a fun slasher movie or a fun action movie But this movie is totally different from most movies you see. It's about a young female who is stuck in a small town, small life scene and reaches out for something new and exciting and different and possibly a little dangerous that is personally fulfilling to her.",10,1,4,1 February 2012
