The Blair Witch Project," Innovation and creativity in horror? Get the #@*! out of here!
","From the very first blurred image of Heather to the shocking final image, I came to the realization that I was witnessing film history.  Filmed on a budget less than the cost of a fully-loaded Toyota Corolla, Blair Witch sends chills up even the most Jaded horror film fan's spine.  How?  By letting your mind do all of the work.  Whatever scares you the most is what these poor kids were up against.'Blair' is the story of three student filmmakers (Heather Donahue, Michael Williams, and Joshua Leonard) who hike into the Black Hills area of the Maryland woods.  They plan on filming a documentary about a local witch legend involving children disappearing in the woods and, most of the time, never returning.  This, however, doesn't seem to phase our heroes who hike into the creepy forest of Burkittsville.  Some things in horror will never change:  The Naivete of teens.Directors Eduardo Sanchez and Daniel Myrick create a world of suspense and horror that would impress the master himself (Hitchcock) and the unsettlingly real performances by Donahue, Williams, and Leonard only add to the effect.  The Blair Witch Project belongs with such Classics as Night of the Living Dead, The Excorcist, and Nosferatu as one of the greatest horrors of all time.",Null,0,1,31 August 1999
Titanic," Am I the ONLY one who didn't care for this one?
","Let me explain by picking this flick apart.  Beginning: good, established the 'characters' nicely, set a decent pace.  It's all downhill from there, folks!  Leonardo DiCaprio's performance could only be described as a poor imitation of a twelve year old doing a poor imitation of Clark Gable (he should at least be happy that I said they're names in the same sentence), and Kate Winslet was either too subdued or, well, way too subdued.  Don't get me wrong, the beautiful costumes and lavvish sets were awe-inspiring. I do admire James Cameron's attention to detail.  I also admire James Cameron's ability to direct an exciting action/adventure film, and therein lies the heart of the problem: this is not an action /adventure film. When the boat was sinking it played more like Indiana Jones and the Temple of Hypothermia than a tragedy of epic proportions, and the fact that the two leads didn't seem scared during the whole ordeal didn't help matters much. To be fair I did, however, enjoy the Band, the old couple in bed, the architect turning back the clock, the captain enduring the oncoming surge. Little things not big enough to save this big picture.rent the Poseidon Adventure.",3,2,3,4 December 1999
A Walk to Remember," I'm sure it was fine, but.....
","...this film seemed to take place in some sort of Babysitter's Club fantasy world, where everyone in the school is fresh out of a Gap commercial.  The forced, goofy dialogue is what chased me away running and screaming.  I didn't see any of the movie after Mandy's line 'On one condition, you must promise you won't fall in love with me.'  Seriously, she actually has to say that, its in a script that was written by someone and later approved by someone else.  NO ONE TALKS THAT WAY!  Pure Danielle Steele without all the good stuff.
This movie was a piece of crap.",Null,0,0,16 August 2002
