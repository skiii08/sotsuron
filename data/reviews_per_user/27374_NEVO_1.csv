The Devil's Advocate," A Lost Opportunity
",There are a lot of great moments in this film. I would describe it as a cross between Rosemary's Baby and The Firm. The tension builds throughout the movie with some scenes quite shocking. The ending is quite frankly pathetic.The ending is the difference between The Devil's Advocate being a good film to being a classic.Message to Keanu - Stick to the airhead roles.,Null,0,1,1 February 1999
