Black Swan," Perfectly walks the line between beuaty and insanity
","I really enjoyed this movie it is the first of Aromofsky's films that I have seen and it was near perfect. The score and cinematography is perfect using many tracking shots. I really liked the sparing use of color since most of this movie is black and white. The one gripe I have with this film is Natalie Portman's preformance which is just all right up until about the last twenty minutes where she really starts to come into her own I did really like a lot of the preformances surrounding hers such as Winona Rider, Vincent Cassel, Barabara Hershey and Kseina Solo. My belief in the transformation of Nina Sayers from innocence to insanity is still beleivavle to me despite Portman's preformance because of the amazing diecting and visuals. All in all Black Swan is a thrill that I would recomend to anyone looking for something different.",9,0,0,10 May 2018
