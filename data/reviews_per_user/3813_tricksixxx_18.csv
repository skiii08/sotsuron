Lucky Number Slevin," Fun but overplayed at times....
","I REALLY wanted to like this movie. In fact I shouldn't say I didn't like Lucky Number Slevin, because I did. Instead I should say I expected better after reading the reviews and watching the trailer for it. A couple of key elements hold Lucky Number Slevin together so we will start with those. The script is amazing. The writing and dialog between characters is very well written and is on par with this year's 'V for Vendetta' (which also had a very well-written script). Josh Hartnett and Lucy Liu played much better than expected and earn some credit in my book since I haven't seen them impress me much in the past. Also, the chemistry between Morgan Freeman and Ben Kingsley was outstanding and the scenes they were in were masterfully written. With that said there are to many flaws present to give this movie higher than a 6. First and foremost is Bruce Willis. It seems to me he is a hit and miss kind of guy. He hit big with Sin City and missed big with Lucky Number Slevin. Though his dialog was nice, he didn't portray his role the way I think it was written and instead acted bland and boring. Realizing that assassins most likely aren't the most dramatic people on earth, I bring forth the idea that he is supposed to be some sneaky ghost of a man. He is supposed to be creepy and slide in the shadows, and Bruce Willis just didn't pull off that vibe to me. Also, the 'twist' in the movie wasn't all that good and seemed like a generic way to end the film. Also I was surprised IMDb didn't put a main genre of this as comedy, since most of it was obviously intended to be comedic. In fact, most of it is comedic up until the last 20 minutes or so. It tries to be something sneaky like the usual suspects, but just fails to enthrall me. It takes itself like the best movie this year, when really I'd rather watch Slither. Good effort by the screenplay writer though and Josh Hartnett deserves his props for sure. 6/10",6,0,9,9 April 2006
Requiem for a Dream," Wow.........
","This is one brilliant piece of art. This movie is in my eyes an instant classic. The story is perfectly sewn together and the direction is original and superb. Never before has a film shown the intensity of drug addiction. Basketball diaries is kool aid in comparison. It is so powerful and moving that it will leave you in awe at the end. The acting is flawless and the plot is hard-nosed and to the point. It doesn't mess around with any aspect of its sincerity. This movie is utterly chilling. There is great re-watching value here as well. Let me just say I believe this movie should be shown in High schools across the nation freshman year, unedited in it's entirety. This movie is a landmark in cinema and I will never forget how it touched me and moved me. Motion pictures like Requiem for a Dream do not ever go away or sink into the shadows of the forgotten. OUTSTANDING.....Wow............. 9/10",9,5,9,17 January 2006
Chinatown," Hey now!
","This is a true hands down classic motion picture. This film is utterly near perfect in its presentation, and flawless in its acting. All you can say when this movie ends is wow. This is 2006, and with all the CGI blowing city blocks to dust and rubble, and nudity and murder stylized and glorified, this film made 32 years ago shows us a dark and disturbing world of the city. Before gangsters had Escalades sittin on dubs, and crack rocks bigger than caramel covered candy apples, we had Chinatown. Gritty, down-to-earth, raw and never flinching, Roman Polanski shows us the not so glamorous parts of humanity. As we watch this crime unfold before our eyes, we come to realize to truth is even more bone chilling than the idea of the truth before it. Polanski touches parts of our soul not generally touched by Hollywood. How perfect can you make a film? This film is about as close as it gets. There are hardly any mistakes in this masterpiece. They never lead you on, or question your intelligence. Classic is the word for this one! 9/10",9,1,3,17 January 2006
Fight Club," One of the best films of the time.
","Fight Club will forever be a classic in my book. I have never quite seen a movie that so wonderfully grips every part of the human emotion and shakes it like the edgy camera seen in the film. Granted it's not some Million Dollar Baby drama with dying characters and tear filled moments of sorrow. It doesn't have women being abused and daddys dying of cancer. What is does have is some brilliant acting, a hard-nosed look at the reality of the every day average blue collar American, and redefines the meaning of mentally insane. This movie stands on the edge and creates a new genre for itself. The script is crafted spectacularly and the plot is so interesting, you will have trouble pausing it for a quick bathroom break. The violence does not try to hide from it's importance in the movie, and the dark gritty feel of the camera matches the setting and tempo of the film with perfection. Never in my lifetime have I seen a movie so artistic and genuinely intriguing. While there are still a few better movies to date, this one ranks up there as one of the best films ever made. 9/10",9,1,3,13 January 2006
Mississippi Burning," Now this is how you make a movie.
","Wow what a picture. This movie sets precedents for bringing to the limelight of how society was just 44 years ago (26 years ago when this movie was made). It's amazing to see how tolerant we have become in just a short period of time. This movie really speaks it's mind and holds nothing back. The acting is superb and the plot is one that can keep me interested up until the end. They don't make many movies like Mississippi Burning. Some part in this film are just so utterly powerful, it's hard to find any bad things about it. Willem Dafoe gives it his all, and he's a great actor. Of course Gene Hackman is very convincing as the tough agent whos morals outweigh his dedication to the FBI. If you are going to make some sort of statement in a movie, this is the best way I can think to do it. By simply making it a high powered, entertaining motion picture, your message can be widely accepted by its viewer and therefore making your statement known and clear. Good job guys! 8/10",8,2,3,17 January 2006
Hostel," Take the kids to this one!
","I don't think some people realized this a dark dark comedy in a lot of ways. I saw Hostel tonight and really enjoyed it. I love seeing people getting up and exiting the movie theatre after systematically throwing down 8.75 to see it. Eli Roth is a very interesting director let me tell ya. Cabin Fever was hated by a lot of people, because of the humor put in place of scenes that should have been exciting and terrifying. While this turns a lot of people off to his style, it gravitates me towards it, and that's what he did with Hostel. The humor is a little more straight forward, and is brilliantly done. If you can't notice the sheer comedy of this flick, then don't bother to review it because you are to stupid for me to care how you criticize it. Roth intently mixes dark humor and vicious, spine tingling torture in a nice hostel soup. Though not really a horror movie like advertised, it is a on the edge thriller without a doubt. Also, make no mistake that this movie is incredibly brutal and shocking. My advice is bring little Billy to this movie and let him get used to this kind of Hollywood because by the time hes 18, he wont even cringe at this sort of thing....just like I didn't. I loved the torture and it kept me glued to the screen to the last horrifying scene. This movie is one guilty pleasure any gore lover shouldn't miss. If you are a fan of dark comedies you might wanna check this one out to if you aren't squeamish. 7/10 baby",7,0,0,8 January 2006
Madagascar," So much potential lost
","The premise for this movie is outstanding. From watching the previews and reading the plot, I thought this was going to be another Shrek of the animation world. Sadly enough, my expectations were shot down pretty quickly. Though the voice acting in Madagascar are well-done, the story never takes off. If they are thinking big name voices are enough to carry an animated film, they are sadly mistaken. Not only did the animation seem low-end, but the only funny moments in it children won't even understand (unless you've let your 6 year old child watch American Beauty). The whole focus of the story with Alex realizing his true instincts as a lion is to prey on his friends is totally underminded for other not-so-interesting aspects of the story. The abrupt and hole leaving ending was anything but satisfying. It was like instead of trying to make a good film, the actors were trying to see who could make their voices better than the other. What a letdown man, I can't believe I spent 4 bucks to rent this off pay-per-view. The only reason this movie gets the score it does is because of 3 things: The good voice-overs, the criminal penguins, and the poor helpless little animal that is constantly frightened (that thing was adorable, and didn't get enough play). 5/10",5,1,3,17 January 2006
The Hills Have Eyes," I must put my two cents in on this one
","Right off the bat, I can tell you this movie will have very mixed reviews. I saw it on opening night with about 70 annoying teenagers, a few small children, and a couple real moviegoers like myself. After viewing the film, I jumped on IMDb to check the early reviews. I would like to address first my position on why the people that gave negative reviews are wrong. You don't go see a film such as The Hills Have Eyes for kid's night out and some good family entertainment. I read reviews that talk about this movie is atrocious and an over the top gore fest and things of that nature. The truth is, this movie is very violent with some gut wrenching scenes and some truly sadistic actions, but it is justified....let me finish. One review stated you would have to be a cold cold person to enjoy a film like this one, and I strongly disagree. This movie has a lot of emotion and very good acting. Very rarely in horror cinema do you get a chance to see what a murder actually does to a family. They really capture the suspense and drama of the situation and it's very real impacts on the family members. There is a lot of very well thought out heart behind the plot of this movie. Second, I read in a review that the gore takes the place of suspense, which is totally incorrect. The large amounts of unflinching gore and violence were put in places that were not supposed to be suspenseful to begin with. The gore comes from the protagonists actually rising up against incredible odds for the sake of love and family. The scene where the main character rises to his feet after being totally drained of all fight from opening his eyes to his wedding ring is absolutely genuine and fantastic. The suspense is there before the protagonists begin their uphill battle when they are the ones being preyed upon. OK now I've addressed a couple issues that concerned me. Now let me give you the good and the bad rundown on The Hills Have Eyes remake. The good points outweigh the bad by a long stretch. #1 - The acting is way above par from what I expected. The guy who plays Bobby is an especially solid and intense actor. #2 - The directing doesn't fall victim to clichéd ways to present a truly eerie feel. Aja gets mad props here. #3 - The antagonists in the movie are crazed and very monster-like, which makes the viewer have absolutely no sympathy for the murderers. To often we see movie makers somehow glorify the cold killers and the agony they place upon people. Not here my fellow moviegoers, here you will feel nothing but hatred towards these savages. Even if they are deformed and mentally unbalanced due to government nuclear testing, they still deserve to die. #4 - -------SPOILER--------- The protagonists actually fight back instead of just getting stalked and murdered like so many other movies. It is great when a movie shows the unbelievable fight a family member can have for another. They fight with every last energy they have and never give up or give in. The family fighting back is really where the gore hits in and it every bit appreciated by the time it happens. People were actually clapping in the movie theater when they fought with heart to overcome the eyes in the hills. -------END OF SPOILER------ #5 - I had to say it guys, the gore. The violence is well placed and satisfying to even 'Hostel' lovers. This stuff is truly unforgiving in it's presentation I kid you not. THIS MOVIE IS NOT FOR THE FAINT OF HEART. #6 - The setting was outstanding. They really show us the isolation and misery of the desert. With edgy camera work and a dark, gritty feel to it, the setting breathes and has a life all on it's own. The setting is the best element of the picture. OK, now for the couple bad elements to the film. #1 - Some parts with the antagonists were a bit cheesy and over acted. They tried to be creepy in a couple parts where it really wasn't needed since the setting and makeup alone was creepy enough. #2 - The protagonists make a couple dumb moves, but then again you must realize that you know the characters are going to go through hell, where as the characters have no idea. #3 - The very last second of the movie was not needed. #4 - The opening scene didn't much impress me and they should have either made it more impacting or just cut it completely. Overall though, this movie is BETTER THAN THE ORIGINAL and gets my 7/10 rating. I hope more people will agree with my points of view on this one and really give it a shot. Any horror fan will not be disappointed. Thanks for the time.",8,1,2,10 March 2006
Collateral," definitely an achievement
","This is a good movie by all means. Though it may not have been worthy of 2 Oscar nominations, it was entertaining and painted a dark picture of L.A. Tom cruise has improved so much as an actor that he can play seemingly any character nowadyays. Bravo, Mr. Cruise! Also, Jamie foxx has established himself as a very good actor as well and he plays the ambitious cab driver thrust into a difficult situation quite well. Cruise portrays the hit-man perfect, and there are some generally touching scenes throughout this movie. The thing about Collateral that stops it from being a great movie is the character build over the plot. In great movies, these 2 are equally divided and told in a brilliant way. Also, this movie would have been much better with a film-noir or independent feel to it, instead of just trying the ordinary built on acting. Overall though, this is a good flick and has some good things going for it. 7/10",7,0,2,17 January 2006
Million Dollar Baby," Doesn't hit the hype.
","I just saw Million Dollar Baby on HBO last night and I must say it doesn't live up to the hype. Is it a good movie? Definitely an achievement for Clint, but it is not one of the greatest movies of all time. The acting is certainly superb, I can't deny that. If you want to be incredibly sad and hurt, this is the movie for you though. It is a tear jerker for sure but where's the creativity? Sure it's interesting but movies are supposed to innovative and creative as well as entertaining. This movie just goes for gritty drama and relies way to much on it's actors to make it. A movie must have more than a line up of great actors to make it great. While the premise touches the heart and then rips depression into your heart, it doesn't have the qualities to be the best of all time. It's just missing that certain creativity to stand out. Unlike Pulp Fiction or Taxi Drive or the Godfather or A Clockwork Orange, this movie will be forgotten with the rest of the Oscar winning dramas. While a good movie, doesn't fulfill the hype, and I found myself sadder at the end of My Dog Skip than this one. 6/10 for acting.",6,0,2,8 January 2006
Saw II," Nicely done....
","-CONTAINS SPOILERS- Instead of repeating what has already been said, I am going to counter some of the reasons certain users said this move was 'horrible'. I am just doing this to show they have no idea what they are talking about. First, some were saying the characters in the film did not communicate and spent the whole time arguing. Not true. They all had an attitude because they were all formers prisoners. Name one prisoner that would be happy-go-lucky about the fact they are gonna die. They communicated quite well, and the on-screen chemistry between the characters was intense and realistic. As for saying the crazy testosterone fueled drug dealer started killing people once he found out the numbers were on their back of their necks instead of just asking, I would say watch the movie again. He plainly tells all of the characters simply to turn around, and they run in a panic because he is obviously insane. After watching him pick up Amanda and throw her in a pit of needles, I would be scared to. The truth of the matter is, the only person he killed attacked him first. He simply told the man to turn around, and the man started beating him up out of fear. And how can you say this movie was predictable? Please, no explanation required for that one. Plot holes? If there are any of those, they are rare and unnoticeable as they did a very good job filling in the holes. This movie wasn't low budget like the first one so it's not as interesting? What kind of logic is that I may ask. How does that take away from the fact the movie was well developed, fast paced, gripping, and horrifying? Why compare a movie to its original? The movie is amazing standing alone. The lighting is not as good as Saw? Same grimy feeling, same dark camera, and same sort of angles and shots make it virtually the same feel. I would like one logical reason how this movie at all sucked. My review? This movie has genuinely tense moments, and will keep you guessing until the last frame. The acting is above average, and the Jigsaw character is absolutely chilling. It is fast paced and packs a punch with every scene. I watch motion pictures to be entertained, and this movie certainly did the job. My eyes did not leave the screen the entire film. In fact, it had me leaning towards the screen in a dumb gaze for its short but effective 93 minutes. The cinematography was outstanding as was the directing and dark script. The ideas are truly thought provoking and the setting is disturbing to say the least. The editing was perfect as was the lighting. As far as horror movies go, this is one of the best. Take a look at this one for a bone-chilling good time.",Null,0,0,23 November 2005
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," An in-Depp spin on Wonka
","I just finished Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and was very impressed. Burton dazzles us with startling imagery and a perfect modern recreation of what we all envision the towering Wonka factory to be. Though Johnny Depp hasn't always impressed me, his quirkiness plays a vital role to bringing the ever-so disturbing character of Willy Wonka to our hearts. We see very quickly how much this movie differs from the original, in some distinct ways. Parts of the setting has been modernized, and is a very interesting mix between times and generations. Also, we see some background to Willy Wonka and explanations to why exactly he is the marvel he is. This movie for every sense was beautiful and stunning. Burton really hands us a treat with this one, and we should treasure it like a tiny morsel of creamy chocolate melting in the mouth. The reasons this movie is not a 9/10 or a 10/10 starts with the oompa loompas. While often funny and strange, the original orange and green oompa loompas served the setting much better. Everything is so colorful in the Wonka factory, why not the oompas? Also, they tried way to hard on the songs and just seem to come out over-the-top and not with the power held by the original's. Also, I would have liked to see Charlie's character have a larger role in the picture. They have reduced his role in the story to give Wonka a bit more depth, which in my opinion hurts the final 20 minutes of the story and impact that it is supposed to serve. Overall this a great movie though and I would recommend it to anybody. If you've never experienced Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, get ready for visuals the will spark your inner child and definitely an in-Depp spin on Willy Wonka and his amazing factory. 7/10",7,0,1,3 January 2006
War of the Worlds," 6.7?
","Let me start by saying the only way I would ever give this movie close to a 7 stars out of 10 is if I was blind folded with ear muffs on and a barrel of a nine milli meter pressed to my sweating forehead and a mass murderer behind it ordering me to write a good review. Since Spielberg's not here, I don't see it happening. If you've read the awful reviews given by other intelligent IMDb users, then you don't need me rubbing in the already pointless argument to how lame this movie truly is. I watch movies for entertainment, even if I have to suspend belief to enjoy the plot, characters, setting, or script. This movie goes far beyond the art of belief suspensions and downward spirals into the abyss of God-awful. I have a feeling Tom Cruise's Scientology 'religion' interfered with his ability to produce any quality acting, as it goes against some fundamental beliefs he has. Wait for this movie to come out on USA and watch it with Geico commercials that way you can enjoy at least some sections of the flick. The only reason I gave this movie 2/10 stars is Tim Robbins and the special effects. Try again Spielberg, you'll get'er next time. I still have faith!",2,1,2,3 January 2006
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Is it better to be a Sith?
","YES! Thank you Lucas for redeeming yourself and the Star Wars franchise with this spectacular spectacle of science fiction entertainment. Oh I tried so hard to like the Phantom Menace, but it lacked the true Star Wars character I was looking for. Then came Attack of the Clones which was definitely an improvement on it's jar jar infested predecessor, but now we have Revenge of the Sith. This move towers over not only the other Star Wars films, but most films in general. It kept me enthralled and glued to the beautiful glow of the screen the entire picture. Every aspect of Star Wars has been thought out and played to the way we all envisioned Darth Vader to become. The acting in this movie is splendid, and is in my opinion Oscar worthy. Of course the action is over the top and great in all forms and the special effects again push the line forward on what we can do. I can't speak enough good things about this picture, so I will just shut up and give it an 8/10!",8,3,5,17 January 2006
Lord of War," Yuri is impressive
","I really enjoyed this film. It's not going to make many top 10 lists, but it does have some very memorable lines, and some memorable scenes.....like the stack of A-K 47s. Nicholas Cage does yet another bang up job as Yuri and is very convincing as an international gun runner. The plot is thick and the directing is nicely done. It never hides from its agenda and never runs from its message. It stays on point and doesn't lose focus on our warlord Yuri. The ending sequences are powerful and there are more guns in this movie than Rambo ever dreamed. The only pet peeve I have about this one is the lack of explanation of how he conquered to much. How he could fly through international air in some scenes with ATF hot on his tail and a few other small things. Then again I suppose they weren't trying to make a 3 hour movie. Nevertheless it is very entertaining and I recommend it for anybody looking to have a good time. 7/10",7,1,2,30 January 2006
Hustle & Flow," Whoop that trick (GET EM)
","This movie is a nice surprise. The acting is great and the elements played out are deep and mesmerizing. The screenplay is perfect for the setting of Memphis, and the overall southern hip hop feel really works. A tough street-wise pimp having a middle aged breakdown is fed up with ghetto livin and the struggle to get by with his few prostitutes, and relatively small drug game. He resuscitates his rap game with an old high-school friend with limited studio equipment. While the protagonist is rough at times, and has few morals when it comes to women, he is surprisingly likable. The complexity of 'Djay' is that he is so simple. Obviously largely uneducated and in touch with how the streets work, he still formulates his musical ability with a hustler's ambition. He knows what he wants and he won't stop until it is obtained. Everyone has to have a dream, whether you have to lie for it or put everything on the line. Luda plays a Memphis boy that made it out of the ghetto with his rhymes, but then becomes consumed in his own image and the fortune put upon him. It makes him a despicable person when it comes down to it, and he really pulled the roll off. I had my doubts about Luda as an actor, but he does a splendid job with it. Overall a good effort by all parties. My pet peeve with this movie is the music is just average. Being involved with rap for years now, you have to understand movies like 8 mile really focus on the lyrics and music makin it a whole different type of movie. While this movie was better acted than 8 Mile with a grittier feel, the musical sequences were completely dominated by 8 Mile. Djay is supposed to come off as a good artist attempting to overcome insurmountable odds, yet his music is just average. On the other hand, there is so much more going on in this film that the music, it really plays a secondary role. Don't get me wrong it still has that Memphis feel to it, it just doesn't compare to 8 Mile's music. That said, it also points to the fact talent isn't always considered more than the actions you do and who you know. If you do a violent act, or have one happen to you that will get you noticed, the rap game will be faster to pick you up regardless. Overall this is a well-done flick and it gets my praises. 7/10",7,0,1,22 January 2006
V for Vendetta," I wanted to not like it.
","Simply because of all the hype and the proposed pro-terrorist agenda surrounding its big screen debut, but dammit it's a good movie. Maybe not AMAZING as some people have been bold enough to say, but it is an an entertaining and fun script and the action is wired up correctly. I usually don't lean towards movies that push political agendas, especially far left or far right ones, but this movie is about revolution. Yes, parliament is blown up, and yes the big ben clock tower is not spared, but these actions lead to a revolt by the people.....all of them, not just a small party with destruction at hand. Once all the people stand up and revolt against a government to overthrow it, it is considered a revolution and it is how America was founded. So before you judge this movie as a promotion for terrorism, watch it for yourself and make up your own mind. As for the acting, it was about what I expected....not great but certainly exceptional. I know nothing about the comic so I cannot comment on it faithfulness, but I hear it's not a very faithful adaptation so comic lovers beware. The action is up to par, even though sometimes it's a little unbelievable and the enemies of V stand still on occasion and just let him pulverize through them. The dark, gritty setting was nice and about what I expected coming in to see it. The ideas were a little far fetched, and America bashing does take place in it from time to time. The sound was very good though, and should be noted to be a good big screen quality. The directing was about average for these types of movies. The violence is not as strong as some may have predicted. Overall this is a good movie with a damn good screenplay and you should check it out for a good time.",7,0,2,19 March 2006
The Island," Michael Bay Nails It
","This is a very good film. Michael Bay has a real gift at stylizing action sequences. Though he failed with Armageddon, and Bad Boys 1, he blew the screen up here. Much like the feel of action in Bad Boys 2, The Island has an interesting premise and a few decent actors. Sure we have seen the idea before, though I wouldn't compare this plot to Logan's run as some have. This movie takes a couple of old ideas and gives them a life of their own. Without giving anything away, when the protagonists in the movie kiss for the first time, it is definitely magic on the screen. This could have been an excellent picture if not for some flaws of reasoning, but again I don't want to give anything away, so you make your own judgement there. I will say a couple action scenes are a bit over-the-top, but good action is why I watch movies like this. The reason this movie gets above a 5 though is because I was really impressed with the pace of the movie and the ideas behind the plot. He does a good job of predicting what 14 years from now may seem like, instead of making it way out of reach. Watch this picture with some popcorn and a girlfriend fellas, it's a lot of fun.",7,1,2,8 January 2006
