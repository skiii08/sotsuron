Child 44," They should teach this in schools! An dark, gritty glimpse of eastern history!
","So much happening in this 2 hour dark masterpiece that i cannot speak about all night! So dark, so gritty and sad. Watch it for yourself and keep it that way, in fact, this is an lesson of the eastern history of Europe! Truly dark in nature, I've lived it more than a quarter- century ago, maybe not that bloody but true, true to history. My parents listened the 'Free Europe' Radio from UK, we were living in Romania, listening that radio could get you in trouble, but they listened it no matter what! It was the single place where you could hear the voice of freedom! I was only a child, but i remember the dark atmosphere, the power blackouts, the gray of the city, the constant fear to speak your mind...so much memories. No wonder that this side of the Europe is undeveloped, just think outside the box for a second, what chance has an orphan kid for an normal life? What chance has an oppressed mind to develop and what can transmit to his children? Please have this in mind next time you speak of undeveloped countries. Perhaps this movie will serve as an lesson for many of us!",9,1,7,26 July 2015
Interstellar," Best SF Movie of the decade! The answer is out there between the stars, we just have to get there...
","I got the chance to see the early screening of Christopher Nolan's Interstellar tonight here in my home-town in Roumania. Interstellar is by far the best SF film of the decade. Nolan's best movie to date! Incredible original story, top notch acting (especially Matthew McConaughey, David Gyasi and Tars's dramatic voice interpreted by Bill Irwin) and unique cinematography made by Hoyte Van Hoytema (Her-2013)My rating for this movie is 10, because in itself this movie is a beginning for a new kind of cinema. And why do i say this? I dare you to watch it and argue with me on the subject! Just open your mind and let Nolan get in, you won't find answers but you'll find more questions. Actually the only 3 questions that matter, question posed by the talented director: Who are we? Why are we here? Where are we going? The answer is out there between the stars, we just have to get there...",10,4,10,6 November 2014
