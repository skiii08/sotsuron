The Incredible Hulk," Not worth it.
","Decent movie until the last 30 mins, then it dropped to dead awful.If you're doing a 'Marvel run' like me, you can skip this one; different actor from the new movies and completely different style.The movie is a mess; the director doesn't know how to make action scenes, the script is uneven, and the characters are sentimental in the most clich√© manner.",3,0,1,17 September 2017
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," Spoiler-free mini review!
","As someone who hated Force Awakens, this was a delight to see, as in Star Wars isn't dead just because Disney acquired it.Rogue One is like a well-written fan film but with a Hollywood budget. You would never expect something like this come out of Hollywood; and that's partially what makes it so great.They put everything in a good balance; suspense, action, and emotion. The ending was also slightly unexpected, despite the fact that we already knew what was going to happen eventually.I was nervous about the choice of director, also reading about various production problems (which of course could just be rumors). But in the end, it all came together, and I'm happy to say that I'm still a proud Star Wars fan.I rate this 8/10, not perfect but almost as good as the original trilogy. Compare this to the 4/10 I gave Force Awakens, which was honestly quite generous.",8,0,4,20 December 2016
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Better than TFA, but still not what it should be.
","Both this and TFA feels like two avarage blockbuster movies that completely ignore the legacy. It's STAR WARS! It could be amazing. But it's not. It's just... okay. And that's exactly why it's not okay. These movies could be so much more. Instead, they settle for mediocracy.",6,0,0,18 December 2017
Guardians of the Galaxy," This was unexpectedly bad.
","Looking at the high IMDb rating I was surprised how bad the movie actually is.Some masked man struts down an abandoned planet, turns out to be the good guy. Scene turns into music and dancing, alright this movie isn't taking itself too seriously. All is fine so far, after all, some of the other Marvel movies are pretty dark so maybe this will turn out well.But it all went down hill from there. The jokes just get worse and worse. And the 'hero'? The kid from the intro that watched his mother die but refused to take her hand is supposedly some kind of Han Solo type of character? Why should we care, when he is so goofy all the time, never taking anything seriously? This is a complete 180 degree turn from the intro scene. There is no connection, and the character doesn't feel credible at all.The point when the movie died for me was when the 'hero' and the raccoon joke about black lights and semen while watching Zoe Saldana's swaying butt disappear up the stair... wtf? I cringed so hard... and the same goes for most of the jokes in the movie; they are misplaced and stupid to the point were you get the impression that the writers just added poor jokes to compensate for poor writing.What I did like about the movie: The tree-man (Groot?), because he had a heart. The rest of the cast is a mess. Also the special effects looked pretty good, even though it's still just generic 3D Hollywood trashfood.",4,2,3,7 September 2017
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Just another Hollywood blockbuster without a soul.
","It's not a bad movie, they did 'just enough' to pack it, slap a label on it and sell it.Good things: - Daisy Ridley, great actress. - Some great moments.Bad things: - Poor dialouge - Poor story (basicly a sloppier version of A New Hope) - Poor character development. The movie is too short, it would need at least another half an hour to make us actually care about the characters. - The new 'emperor', poor CGI character that just appears as an oversized hologram. I almost laughed in the cinema. - Poor ending, we watch a bunch of CGI action in space and suddenly we're on Ireland (or whatever) and Luke appears, not saying a word, just looking old and grumpy. Movie ends. lolwut?I rate it 6/10. The second & third movie can be great, time will tell. But this one? Nah... not worth the ticket price.",4,10,19,22 December 2015
Her," Weak film.
","The director/writer has cool ideas but fails to develop an believable story. Most of the film is rather predictable and boring. Casting Scarlett as the AI voice is a huge distraction, should have been a more unknown actor. The behavior of the AI is not very interesting either, it's like a vision of the future of someone that has no knowledge of neural networking and fantasies about 'what an AI could be'. The film could have been great with a more visionary director, someone with actual interest in technology.",6,1,2,9 February 2019
