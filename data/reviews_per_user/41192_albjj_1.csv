Hereditary," Mediocre at best
","I can't fathom how people could say that this is good horror. Good horror is the first three 'Hellraiser' films, or The Japanese films 'Dark Water' and 'Juon', or the French film 'Martyrs' for example. I almost fell asleep numerous times while watching this snore fest. How this has been rated higher than 'The Witch' is a complete mystery. I was not the least bit scared at any time during this film. The ending was absolutely pathetic.",1,5,11,22 August 2018
