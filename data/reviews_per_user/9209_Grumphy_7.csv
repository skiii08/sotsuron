Blade Runner 2049," Do sheep dream of organic androids?
","Blade Runner 2049 in not a bad film per se, it's a decent replica reminiscent of the original, but unfortunately it's as shallow as it's hollow. A contradiction not all that unlike to the film itself. It boasts great visuals yet this time with a sole purpose to look cool, rather than to support the story. The grimy and gritty world does not exist as it did in the previous film: dark, noiresque, full of life. This time around the grit feels superficial, sterile even. And not in the infertile kind of way. A lot of beautiful scenes but with no real purpose. I guess that's why a lot of people recommend watching it in 3D, so at least that way you'd get at least some of your money's worth.Talking about pointlessness. Mixed in with the run time. There are a few scenes that should've been dropped either because they make no sense or are just pure unnecessary exposition. Why they're in the film? Guess they felt they needed to insert one specific action scene out of nowhere just to keep the viewer from falling asleep. And obviously they needed a scene for just the bad guy so that the audience would know that he's not just regular household evil bad dude, but a few steps extra. Etc. Which brings me to how magnificently cliché ridden this film is. One would think 2049 stands for the number of overly overused solutions in storytelling that they've included in the new Blade Runner. You can rarely escape from the hurricane of clichés. I guess these days it seems to be the criteria for the Hollywood's mass produced, mainstream mental-detainment. Thinking back now, I hope I am mistaking, because I can't remember a single original or unique moment in the whole film. Perhaps it's also one of the reasons why Blade Runner 2049 lacks the depths the first one took a dive into. Sure, it tries, but its attempts are feeble. The ideals or aspirations don't resonate because, well, they seem manufactured. Pardon my pun once again. Despite all of this, and make no mistake, I am no fanboy of the first film either (though I do think it's objectively better), you can still go for the ride and enjoy it. Even if it's going to be a bit jarring because of the overall pacing, but that also gives you time to repress some of the dumbest moments and imagine what else could go on in the world like that. Because the universe in Blade Runner is by itself pretty damn cool, just a shame the second film did not improve upon that.",7,2,6,11 October 2017
The Death of Stalin," Stalin's dead! Long live the satire!
","Death of StalinAKA how to tell the story of human greed so that it's entertaining and revolting at the same time. AKA if history books/teachers would tell things even slightly as colourfully as this, more people would pay attention. The story is very well presented. Artistic liberty is backed by major facts. Dialogue is witty and fuels the situations in which most of the humour lies. And most of everything is in contrast with everything. People are in contrast with each other and with themselves and with humanity. The story takes some really grim turns at times. Quite unexpectedly so. It kind of cheats you to think it's a more light hearted piece of work than it actually is. It's not. That also is a form of contrast. Acting leaves little to be desired. Though the pronunciations of some of the names can perhaps be a bit of a put off. For people with a little more knowledge in Russian language than vodka, medved i babuschka. Luckily they don't over use the names and convincing acting makes it more than even. At first I didn't even think that Steve Buschemi is fit (as in necessary shape) to play Khrushchev, but at the end I had no doubt that he was the perfect choice. The rest of the cast is excellent as well. Beria is as intimidating and repulsive as one can imagine. Perhaps Stalin's son is the biggest question mark, because he was straight out of control and can therefore seem a bit too theatrical than perhaps necessarily comfortable without it actually being so.Visuals are decent. Definitely not great, and the budget reflects that, but then again the focus is completely on something else. Camera movement is nicely put to work to help the story. Some nice plays with the use of perspective. General tone and the pace of editing fits the purpose. Directing is nuanced and well thought out. I wouldn't say that the film is hilarious, however. Not many films are, in my opinion. It's funnier in some places, more sinister in others. Humorous for the most part. But hilarious, no. That would be too much of a contrast perhaps. Too much of a grotesque. Too horrifying to laugh out loud from the beginning to the end. Only a complete moron or someone with complete disregard for humanity would do that. Because, though this is just a film, what happened, really happened. And I am not talking about what is seen, but what is not. Armando Iannucci walks a fine line, makes a statement, leaves us entertained and gives us something to ponder about.",7,2,8,18 January 2018
Darkest Hour," Not dark enough
","Darkest HourI wonder if anyone's heard anything about that story before. Is it real? Yes? How real is it? Does it matter? Pretty much everything in the film is overshadowed by the performance of the majesty that is Gary Oldman. So much so that it's even nominated for the Oscar Award in Best Achievement in Cinematography, though it has its fair share of 'mishaps'. Anyway. Back to the screenplay, which, once again, as it's a 'based on' production, takes perhaps certain liberties that are somewhat difficult to swallow in the form of inane scenes and moments that would be (are) cringe worthy if not for the great acting. Oldman is spectacular and like some have said - it's a one man show. Which it's true. Not to lessen others, well established members of the cast, who are also great, but it just goes to show the magnitude of Oldman's performance and pretty much just because of that, it's a film worth watching.All in all, the general set design, costumes and make up are to be praised. However, the camera work is way over the top at times and goes overboard with the extravagant behaviour. Unnecessarily so. It did not help the storytelling, if anything, it diminished it and the general effort put in the rest of the film's CGI budget. Definitely not something worth giving an Oscar for. Directing wise, if you've seen Joe Wright's earlier work, you pretty much know what you can expect. He does a decent job, but it rarely touches the ceiling. And though Darkest Hour is enjoyable for the most part, the aforementioned issues cripple the story. It seems like director himself was on the point were he had to choose and unfortunately he chose to give in. Perhaps it makes the story more cinematic. One could argue. But it definitely didn't make it dark enough.",7,0,3,24 January 2018
Knives Out," The film is as colourful as the poster suggest, but it's a good thing.
",Knives Out is a whodunit and hosts a plethora of interesting characters who remain within the roles of the genre's archetypes but doesn't become cheap tropes. The various twists and turns do not feel forced and everything has its place. One might say it fits together like a puzzle. Thoroughly entertaining from start to finish,8,3,16,25 November 2019
Ready Player One," I guess that title makes sense because it is a film about a video game... an online video game... with billions of players... but ah nostalgia or something
","So. Apparently there are a lot of people quite unhappy about the way the book was adapted. Now, I haven't read it, so I'm willing to give it the benefit of a doubt and perhaps it might contain something resembling at least a half decent story. Be it as it may, it seems that Spielberg chose to settle with the most crass and cliched aspects and run with them. The film is littered with menial 80s references. Seems like in the 2050s time is on a standstill and nothing relevant has happened for about half a century. However, even the more numerous than the references, are the plot holes, but I'll let that slide because otherwise I'd never finish writing this. Suffice to say the film is held together by the swarm of plot holes and convenient coincidences.Acting is forgettable but that's understandable. All things considered. Situations and dialogue do not lend themselves to great moments. So once again. Would mainly blame poor writing on this one, than the actors and actresses themselves.Visually it's alright, I guess. Though there are a lot of questionable decisions. The future does not really seem like the future. The OASIS does not really seem like an advanced VR computer program. And the people running around in the streets, in the real life, while wearing VR headsets is straight out moronic, but the bright colours, flashing lights and empty action scenes should keep the kids in their seats, chewing their popcorn.The overall film direction, moods, 'plot twists' and characters are all just so bland, generic and manufactured, that it's tough to care about the characters and their 'problems'. It makes me question how much Spielberg really spent time on the project. Especially considering that 'The Post' came out a few months earlier. Which wasn't all that great either but should definitely have higher score on IMDb than 'Ready Player One'. At least it seems that Metacritic agrees with that as well.Bottom line is that the film has nothing to offer. Nothing good anyway. It's mindless and did I mention that it's full of story breaking plot holes? But what does it matter right? There's a good guy who likes a girl and he does some action stuff and beats the evil dude because there's always the unnecessarily evil dude and in the end he gets the girl and everyone lives happily ever after and that's all what what you really want so you just don't care how badly it's all presented.",2,1,2,17 April 2018
Call Me by Your Name," Call Me Maybe
","Call Me by Your NameAnother not another love story. Beautifully told. Simple enough to follow, yet complicated enough to experience. Dialogue can be a bit sappy at times, but I guess that is a side effect of love rather than just bad writing. Nevertheless it feels stupid. Other times it can be a bit too vague. The dialogue. As well as what's currently happening. These are mostly minor issues though.Acting is great. Perhaps even slightly over done for the main character. Not in a bad way though. Perhaps they just wanted to show him off. Switching between 3-4 languages, playing guitar and piano with ease that'd make Rachmaninov blush; scribing music, reading tons of books and looking like a teenage Greek god in the process, is too good to be true. Relations between people feel natural and organic and most part realistic. Or lets say believable rather than realistic. The visual style and tone is smooth and gentle. Fitting well with the general flow of the film. Setting feels authentic and fit for the period. The countryside is as dreamy as everyone. The soundtrack, concerning the pop music, is brilliant. Did not care too much about the piano score in some parts. Though there is piano played in the film, the piece playing in the background at times, did not seem to fit. Pace seems to limp on occasion, but is not a major concern. There aren't too many obvious mistakes, but the scene where they pick up a freshly found archaeological artefact like it's just a random stick, is mind-blowing. Overall, Luca Guadagnino does a great job in portraying love without the usual drama and still maintains interest. It's easy to destroy innocence, much harder to retain, but the film succeeds. And his love looks a lot like love. And love doesn't care who you are.",7,1,2,18 January 2018
12 Strong," Perhaps just not quite strong enough
","12 StrongStory was ordinary. Nothing you haven't seen thousand times before. Pretty straightforward from the beginning till the end, but it worked. Dialogue was mostly sharp and clever, with a few missteps here and there. As it was yet another 'based on a true story' there were moments, quite a few, that felt way overly glorified. Artificial even. But perhaps that was a necessary evil to create more meaning for characters. Which, speaking about the devil, brings me to the compulsory over the top villain, because bad guys have to be maxed out on all aspects of vile behaviour. Acting was solid for the most part. Great cast all around. Hemsworth pulls his weight and the team follows. At times even blindly, which is fine, because the enemy (because they're bad) shoot like stormtroopers. However, the next time I'd recommend taking more cover, and wearing a helmet couldn't hurt either. Perhaps they're too pretty and wanted to show it off?Which brings me to visuals. Action was engaging and tense, nothing bad to say about that. Some key explosions felt a little flat though. Camerawork was enjoyable. Nothing too fancy and therefore unnecessary. No crazy 'shaky cam' during the chaotic battle scenes, but a mandatory shell-shock sequence, which seemed a tad too familar.The score and sound is decent. Both serving their purpose, but don't really go that extra mile. In a film such as this there probably isn't any need to. Unless one likes to challenge themselves to find out exactly how many guns are firing all at once during a scene or a take. If that's even possible. No memorable song to listen to when riding into a battle either. Well. It really wouldn't be much of a covert operation, crawling between the rocks, 'Valkyries' blasting from the boom-box. Same goes for directing. It's a job done well. All in all. And despite some minor gripes, the film is enjoyable for the most part. But I cannot help but feel like it fell a tad short. It seemed a bit too clean and cut out. What was coloured in was kept exactly within the lines. I guess that's that 'based on' aspect. Life itself is much more colourful, it doesn't care about borders. It's ragged, jagged and jaunty. Quite like the truth. And there are many true sides to any true story.",6,31,70,18 January 2018
