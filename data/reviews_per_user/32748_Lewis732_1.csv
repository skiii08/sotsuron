Lucky Number Slevin," This movie could have been great, but the ending was so long that it killed it
","Something was wrong with this movie. I really expected it to be excellent, but I was disappointed. I expected it to have a lot more style, but it didn't have it. I expected it to be funnier, but it wasn't. The plot was very good. It was smart. The twist was good. But the biggest problem was what happened after the reveal. It spoon-fed everything to you. It showed you every scene that you'd want to look at twice over again. So, instead of how Usual Suspects so excellently just showed you a quick montage of all of the things that you'd like to review, this movie actually spends half an hour on that 'montage'. You see everything so clearly that there's nothing left for you to guess about, or imagine, or think about. And it gives you no reason to want to watch it again. And showing how the girl really doesn't get killed? That just cuts against the intelligence and the bond of Mr. Goodkat and Slevin... With a re-cut, much tighter ending, this maybe could have been the suspense movie it was trying to be.",5,2,10,12 April 2006
