Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," A Good Comedy Can Be a Physical Workout
","'Borat' is hands down the funniest movie I have ever seen. Even though some of the physical comedy may repulse people it can be easily forgiven because 'Borat' sets a new standard for the entire comedy film genre.If you go see this film, you can afford to miss your daily (or weekly) workout at the gym. You'll be laughing so hard for 84 minutes that your abdominal muscles will cramp reflexively, toning and firming your six pack (or two pack, whatever) just as if you were using the ab machine at the gym. If you tend to laugh actively, you may have some scrapes and rug burns on your hands from slapping the arm rest and falling helplessly to the floor in spasms of laughter.Now you've been warned.",10,3,16,9 November 2006
Shaun of the Dead," Can you believe it? A funny, campy, emotionally stirring film!
","I haven't been this impressed with the directing and script of a film for ages! A few years back, I read in a magazine article that attendance at the cinemas has decreased over the years because audiences are realizing that they can get the same caliber of entertainment (particularly romantic comedies) from TV. 'Shaun of the Dead' puts movies back where they belong--as a respite to the garbage on mainstream American television. SOTD is an old-new kind of movie-making--a reminder of Hollywood's yesteryear where outstanding script and original direction is as it should be the bread and butter of the film industry.I haven't laughed this hard at the movies or been moved emotionally for a long time. This film has it all. Don't let the title fool you--it's more than just a funny, campy film about zombies. It will touch you in more ways than you can imagine.",Null,0,1,30 October 2004
Brokeback Mountain," It Delivers Every Step of the Way
","It helps that two handsome young actors are the protagonists in this film. Nonetheless it's a great film with great acting. What can I say that the newspapers and magazines haven't already said a thousand times over? Ledger is a ripe young actor truly flexing his acting muscles for the first time and stunning us with his skill for someone so young. Lee, as usual, teases out genuine emotions and life-like struggles--the fear, longing, and sadness in this tragedy. This is Lee's work at its best. The fine adaptation of Annie Proulx's short story by McMurty and Ossana is highly commendable. They carefully painted a portrait of life in 1960s Signal, Wyoming, setting a very realistic stage for the drama to unfold. All in all, it's impossible for such a formidable group of people not to produce a marvelous work of art. The cast, screen writers, director, and even novelist each rank among the finest in their respective fields. This movie could not have gone wrong and it doesn't; it delivers every step of the way.",9,8,11,18 December 2005
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," There is No Hero
","The whole Star Wars Prequel (both I and II) has been one big disappointment. All that movies seem to rely on these days are special effects. I found Star Wars: Episode II to be as confusing as Episode I. The genius which Lucas had drawn from the works of Joseph Campbell in the 1970s is highly lacking in the new episodes. Maybe it's for the simple fact that one has no interest in relating to any of the characters in the movie because there is no true hero and no real character involvement. Though George pushes for it, we all know where Anakin is headed and we are loathe to identify with this future traitor. The glory of the first Star Wars trilogy lay largely in the hero, Luke, who embodies the noblest and most ideal qualities of humanity.  Luke Skywalker inspired the audience with his naivete, integrity, growing wisdom, lofty idealism, and his eventual journey towards Jedi glory.  The viewer lived out Luke's experiences vicariously.  But in the new Star Wars triology, there is no one to take on the responsibility of our imagination.Certainly not the illaudable Anakin, who is surely the greatest known disappointment, nor the personality-less Jedi Council and grammatically challenged Yoda.  Not the uninspiringly fallible Obi-Wan (his folly being his conceit). And definitely not the passively hyper-feminine Senator Padme (at least Leia had an attitude on her--thanks to the saving grace of the Women's Liberation movement). These characters provide little fodder for an audience's yearning for heroism with a greater purpose. Though the prequels provides the history to Star Wars IV, V, and VI, they are unlikely to appeal to mass audiences who care less about science fiction and more about universal themes of human growth, change, and triumph over adversity. In Star Wars I and II, Lucas fails to engage the audience with these crucial elements that comprise a great heroic epic.",Null,0,0,15 May 2002
The Matrix Revolutions," Uneven movie, some dialogue insightful, some insipid.
","Best part of the movie were the special effects. The serpentine machines are wonderfully animated and the soundtrack is very intense and appropriate for conveying the might and threat of these machines. The settings (city of Zion, Machine City) are beautifully filmed, and you will be fully transported to another world.**SPOILERS**Hugo Weaving as Agent Smith, the insidious computer program, is compelling and full of interesting thought somewhat prosaic computer-type observations (eg, love is just conjured from the feeble human mind). Smith is one of the few characters in the movie who isn't full of foolish platitudes and excessive melodrama. He's spiteful but in spite of his spite(?), his observations are more keenly expressed than those of the other characters. It seems as if two different writers wrote the script for Smith and the script for the other actors. Maybe it's because of this that most of the newer actors (Matrix Reloaded and later) seem to just blur together indistinctly. I suspect that the interesting philosophical and existential musings throughout the film originated with the Matrix comic book series. I somehow don't believe the Wachowski brothers could have come up with these philosophical ponderings. I enjoyed them more than any other dialogue in the film. The observations of some of the other characters struggling so hard to sound wise come off as frivolous. The fact that they speak their lines with such a serious face nearly made me double over from laughter. Let's put it this way, these guys are pure cheese, whereas dialogues engaged with questions of existence, its purpose, and human nature are much more thought-provoking. I found this film to be nearly as uneven as Artificial Intelligence, though the unveven-ness is less readily discernible.",Null,0,0,25 November 2003
American History X," Transformation too good to be true, but an amazing film nonetheless
","The first word that escaped my lips after the film was 'WOW'. A wonderfully directed film with outstanding performances from Edward Norton, who plays Neo-Nazi, Derek Vinyard, and Jennifer Lien, who plays his frustrated sister. 'American History X' is one courageous movie.I didn't think such a realistic and sensitive portrayal of a skinhead could be possible. Though I felt that Norton's character, after a traumatic event, capitulated to the embrace-all-minorities point-of-view too quickly, the distinct periods in which he hated minorities and accepted them were wonderfully performed. The only part of the movie that made me uncomfortable was the transformation of Derek Vinyard. Throughout the film, I sensed an urgency to turn a misguided skinhead into a good guy (maybe someone who doesn't embaress white people?). The director, writer, actors all probably wanted Derek Vinyard to become more tolerant, less angry, (and, dare I say it?) more in line with the current racial politics that embraces diversity and abhors racism.But in order for Derek Vinyard to be believeable, he has to transform from a Neo-Nazi racist into less of a racist. The change in Derek Vinyard seemed overnight and miraculous. His change is like laser eye surgery that instantly restores 20/20 vision. Reality doesn't work like that. Derek the immigrant-hating Neo-Nazi suddenly became Derek the benevolent, people of color-loving liberal. I just can't buy it. Being a person of color myself, and having encountered more racism in my lifetime than I care to remember, I have never seen miraculous transformations in life. Nobody goes from complete bigotry to complete tolerance. A more credible outcome is that Derek remains uncomfortable with his former African-American history teacher and other minority groups. He will still be grappling with his conscience--guilt for the senseless murders, knowledge that he killed people of his teacher's ethnicity, and desire to protect and release himself from the misery of old hatreds.This film definitely has a social conscience, and wants to teach people well. I commend its success with such a difficult topic. Right after watching 'American History X', I saw 'Monster's Ball'. The latter was not a good movie to begin with, and unfortunately it came on the heels of one of the finest movies ever made about race politics in the United States.The only other complaint I have is that the film ended too happily. It is a sad movie that tries to make you feel good in the end. But that's not realistic. Edward Furlong's character, after hearing his brother's ordeal, shrugs off all his former prejudices and joins his brother's newfound doctrine of love-thy-ethnic-neighbor. The insidious influences of Cameron Alexander evaporates into thin air. I just can't quite buy it.",Null,0,0,18 June 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Choppy and Uneven
","I don't know what compels audiences to sit through 'The Two Towers' (TTT), especially when Peter Jackson's directing is uneven, the storyline choppy, and the movie endlessly long (nearly 3 hours). In the book, many events unfold simultaneously, but to depict Tolkien's finely crafted synchronicity takes a directorial finesse that Jackson just doesn't have in TTT. Though the special effects and musical score are very impressive, when a film relies heavily on these elements rather than narrative drive to evoke emotions and to move the story forward, you know the film is floundering. Several vistas of New Zealand's majestic geography are accompanied by equally evocative music. But whether the shots of the landscape were ill-timed or just too numerous, most of these scenes failed to convey any emotional intensity. In fact, the audience is left feeling a bit bored by it all. An example of better use of music and landscape shots is in 'Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon' (CTHD). It wasn't that CTHD had better scenery or more dramatic music, but that these scenes came at appropriate times and did not look awkwardly placed. Jackson's camera work also leaves much to be desired. The camera pans in and out at breakneck speed, naturally taking advantage of the immersive experience of a large movie screen, but the camera moves so quickly at times that the audience doesn't get a chance to form an emotional bond with characters. The sense of intimacy one tries to develop with characters is crippled when the camera zooms out precisely at the moment when we are starting to get to know them.Though the directing is nothing to brag about, TTT does have a few things to applaud. The special effects are truly amazing and several characters are well-developed in the script.",6,0,0,24 December 2002
