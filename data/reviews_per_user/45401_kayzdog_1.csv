Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Lucas does it again!
","The movie was great.  Jar jar sucked, but the rest of the movie was wonderful.  Star wars movies have always set the standard for other movie makers when it comes to special effects.  No movie will ever come close to this for at least another year.  Lucas is a mastermind, and I commend his effort for this film.",10,0,0,20 May 1999
