"Run, Fat Boy, Run"," Typical rom com fare with a serving of Pegg.
","If you're looking for a good romantic comedy to take a date to or something right now, go to see Run Fatboy Run. Simon Pegg of Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz fame (along with other comedies and Spaced, a popular British TV show) co-writes and acts in a movie about a man who, five years after running out on his pregnant fiancée on the day of their wedding, attempts to win her back by beating her American boyfriend at a marathon--no easy feat as he's lazy, overweight, out of shape, and generally lacks the whole discipline thing to really make something of himself.The majority of the proceeds is straight-up rom-com fare: the at-appearances wonderful successful boyfriend (Hank Azaria) is actually a jerk, the underdog flies his way up the presentability ladder to become someone the female just can't resist, and he proves himself to the greater of society as well. Conflict is in the form of romantic feud, people who obviously don't believe in him, and a general unimpressed world to contend with. Nothing is unexpected.But the point of these fares are really to entertain and beget optimism, and hey, Simon Pegg is GREAT at that. He's honestly a really good actor, and does his role with aplomb. Meanwhile, he's backed up by Shaun of the Dead supporter Dylan Moran and an attractive and lovable Thandie Newton. Whether for a night out for some good escapism or maybe a rental for friends, it serves up a well-known and well-made dish.Just... don't see it with anybody in the medical or athletic health profession. They'll spend a lot of time gripping about the end. And to be sure, the result of the marathon isn't exactly something to be aspired.--PolarisDiB",6,2,5,16 April 2008
Black Swan," Sticks close to what you should expect, with enough room to surprise newcomers to the genre
","This movie is actually difficult for me to review because it was pretty much exactly what I expected, through and through. I place Aronofsky's greatest gift at putting the viewer into the mindset emotional topography of the character, but here it sort of comes as part of the package, considering he's making what is honestly an identity thriller typical of his contemporaries back in the late 90s. You've really got it all here, mirrors, doppelgangers, mirrors, sexual confusion, mirrors, blurring of fantasy and reality, and mirrors within mirrors. If we consider 'identity thriller' to be a genre, this is one of its more straightforward additions.That said, it's still shot beautifully, featuring a particular style of grayscale that had me captured by the first few moments of the trailer and never ceased to let me down throughout the actual movie. And as Aronofsky's gift for cerebral suturing goes, unlike in his other films where such an immersion takes place over time, you're basically stuck in Nina's head from the moment the movie starts, with only enough indication of the world outside the movie to make everything so deliciously claustrophobic.But what makes that work (as opposed to just make you shift in your seat uncomfortably for two hours) is two things: Natalie Portman's acting, and small details in the background characters. Portman's acting does not need too much elaboration because she's the star of the show, and shines: that's what is. What helps is that it's counterpositioned against the rest of the ballerina troupe--not just Lily, but the rest of them as well. There, petty jealousies, misunderstood whispers, even gestures with no significance intended set the entire tone of the scene for Nina/us. It's common enough to set a movie inside someone's rapidly deteriorating mind--but it's really difficult to do what I think Aronofsky pulled off doing, and that is showing enough indication that there's an actual reality outside of the mind being completely washed over from stress. Dare I say that this movie is then exactly what it would be like, having a mental breakdown while the evidence is clearly there that the breakdown is occurring? Certainly there have been times when I've known there is nothing to be upset about, but managed to let myself go anyway. The problem here is that Nina is outright encouraged to go crazy.Another thing I really like about this movie, though, is that it's potential for literary allusion or allegorical meaning or whatever is actually ignored. It would have been so easy for Aronofsky to use this space as a place to pound Meaning and Significance, but for all the stylistic shenanigans I'd actually consider this movie quite reserved. The stuff that happens is kinda crazy but when it's over, it's over, and we're not left with some unearned pseudoquestion like whether the top falls or keeps spinning. We know what happened, because that's all the movie is concerned with doing.I don't think it's Aronofsky's best, nor that it should really surprise anyone who has ever heard of David Lynch, Nicolas Roeg, or Jorge Luis Borges (to name just a few off hand). I think this movie might have been quite the profound experience to someone not familiar with those people or Aronofsky's other work, in which case I recommend they follow up. For those who love or hate Aronofsky, it is not going to change their mind either way one bit. And for those of you who are like, 'Eh? Aron-who-sky...? Bore-gus? Isn't this the movie with Natalie Portman and Mila Kunis getting it on?!' yes, yes they do, and it's... pretty much the type of sex scene that is featured in a movie like this, which means you'll probably have something else on your mind while it's happening, like figuring out what the heck is going on. It's not that type of movie, bro.--PolarisDiB",7,1,2,24 April 2011
Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," Just the type of contemporary summer blockbuster needed.
","Now that graphics and interest has caught up, comic book adaptations have become normalized, and cross-franchising doesn't seem as unexpected as it once was, feature length movies have officially reached the ability to become serialized--and this is a good thing. Not to say that there are not movies in the past with a nearly endless line of sequels--horror and porn are sort of infamous for it--and furthermore, film serials were quite common before movies expanded to multiple reels, but nowadays we practically have franchise movies sold in narrative blocks of three. The problem is when each episode depends on each other--which is why Pirates of the Caribbean 2 and 3 are not that great, why Matrix 2 and 3 are not that great, and why On Stranger Tides is the sequel Curse of the Black Pearl deserved. Maybe other franchises will also embrace general serialization as a stand-alone interest, maybe not. Nevertheless, On Stranger Tides should make an example of things.It probably won't, because... people don't think about things like this... but nevertheless, what really DO you expect from Pirates of the Caribbean? You expect Jack Sparrow, and you don't expect him to be particularly bothered to make a point of doing specific things in a way that garners a logical plot. For that, you need other characters with other interests to drive the story. The problem with 2 and 3 is that it was bogged down in characters that outlived their welcome (Elizabeth and Will, aka Keira Knightley and Legolas) whilst introducing a broad array of other characters, none of which the filmmakers writers, director, or producers alike wanted to kill, dragging the story on an endless array of double-crossings until it finally just got tired and fell down like a kid spinning round and round yelling. Pirates 4 does the necessary and gets rid of all that crap. Now characters are in danger. Now they could possibly die. Now, when a handsome loverboy finds his missus magical (this time a clergyman and a mermaid, heck yeah!), the movie lets them do their lover-ly thing and sinks them into the water to be forgotten for good.This movie is the continued adventures, but in the way that anybody could come in or out as they please. Jack gets a bit more backstory, the worldbuilding gets broader, and there are flesh eating mermaids (not necessarily far from traditional merlore, but let's keep in mind this is the same studio that is responsible for Ariel the princess on first grader girls' backpacks). The only reason to see 2 and 3 would be to understand why Barbossa appears in 4--a throwback again to the fact that nobody wanted to kill anybody in the second two sequels, and in fact just had to bring back basically the only dude who died in film 1! More importantly, this movie has Blackbeard. After about seven or eight long hours combined of pirates scowling and buckles a-swashing (swashes a-buckling?) and a rather tepid Cthulhu wannabe Davey Jones following up the at this point fully all-too-lovable Barbossa, Blackbeard fills the presence of the screen with some real sense of unease. This is one maniacal pirate, whilst being cold and calculating--FINALLY! Spritey Jack has a foil! Blackbeard is everything Jack Sparrow is not--solid, burning, serious, destructive, fearful, and evil. The best part is, however, he has a relationship you can actually connect to--and its his treatment of that relationship that really shows how dangerous this guy is.Now let's get to the use of 3D. 3D technically doesn't do anything aesthetically good depth of field couldn't do in 2D, but for what it's worth, Rob Marshall and Dariusz Wolski don't clutter up the foreground of vision with out-of-focus layers (in other words, the exact thing your eyes were they on their own would focus on first, but instead stay out of focus because the camera decides) and lets the characters' faces loom in foreground, the world of fantasy and adventure in the background. It's a good choice, this movie is much more pleasant on the eyes in terms of stress than even Avatar, which reveals the limits of 3D in almost the very first frame with that friggin' droplet hanging in the air. And if you are the type of person to pay attention to such things, this movie is cut a bit slower than previous fares, probably to make room for the 3D and the delayed reaction times to spacial cuts audience's eyes have. It looks like Hollywood is finally learning to use its little spectacle beast correctly, finally. However, just as Avatar looks better in 2D, I wonder if Pirates 4 wouldn't seem a bit slow and laggardly in 2D. I suppose I'll find out later since I wouldn't mind watching this one again.At any rate, this movie is pretty much just as it should be, as far as the franchise and the technical aspects are concerned. Hopefully discontinuous serialization of franchises will continue to occur whilst 3D filmmakers keep their frames clutter free, and maybe someday Disney won't own a near monopoly on swashbuckling. Amen.--PolarisDiB",7,1,2,29 May 2011
Come and See," Visceral
","Have you ever had that dream where you're trying to run as hard as you can but don't seem to be moving very fast at all? One scene in this movie is that dream recreated amazingly! This is a Russian war movie about WWII, or rather, about a young boy eager to join the ranks in WWII but is immediately sent through about every torment personal and psychological imaginable.A lot of it is very visceral, gut-wrenching fear and agony at the atrocities being shown, but at the same time it has this flowing neatness about it. This movie loves the land that's being destroyed around it, the trees and the birds and the sounds, and with long smooth tracking shots it seems to suck in the idea of beauty everywhere it goes... even if the camera is focusing on the charred remains of a still-living but barely comprehensible human being who was torched by the Nazi army.It's also a very subjective based film, dealing almost entirely through the eyes of the young boy who is perfectly acted by a kid much younger than me! In order to increase the pov feel of this film, much time is spent having the characters or faces looking directly into the camera and talking to the audience, something that is effective in a lot of situations anyway but in this film basically traps the audience Clockwork Orange style into sitting and watching every minute of it.--PolarisDiB",10,5,8,19 April 2006
Walk the Line," When everything works together...
","Honestly, I was incredulous when Ray was getting all the attention it was getting.I was incredulous when Walk the Line was getting all the attention it was getting.And what do you know but that is but an arbitrary and minor parallel that ties these two brilliant works of art together.While some people might complain about a formula developing, such a complaint is slightly unfair. Sure, the focus of the two movies are similar enough that the exposition of the storyline sometimes seems a bit familiar, something that in a time where originality is upheld as one of the highest virtues, might lead people in the wrong direction about regarding works such as these critically.So they both involve a death of a brother at a young age. Uh, those deaths? They actually happened. So they both involve drug addiction. Uh, that actually happened. So they both involve adultery and special love interest. Well, that actually happened. And you say it's a shame how both deal so much with post-traumatic stress disorder? Well... with the things they've gone through.But focusing on Walk the Line alone now, let us contemplate on what this movie so GOOD.For one thing, the acting comes readily to mind. Acting is one of the most readily apparent and focused on parts of film-making for the reason that it's basically what makes or breaks the story. The acting in this film? Brilliant, and I'm not just saying that. Joaquin phoenix's role isn't just unbelievable... it's really believable. Reese Witherspoon pulls of June Carter and honestly it's difficult to imagine an actress like her actually pulling the strings like that. Okay, so I'm biased because she's been in mainstream movies of little importance. But that's the point: she does really well, completely redefining my image of her.And then they can both sing, which I find hilarious considering most vocalists of modern bands can't even seem to sing yet two actors can and can also sing exactly like the people they're portraying. Ahhh, the state of modern music... but I digress.Secondly, the writing. As discussed above, the story follows the same rough outline as Ray, but it is different in this way: Johnny Cash is a different character than Ray Charles. Furthermore, the story they tell of Johnny Cash's life is very good, very touching, and very well presented. It made the music itself seem that much more powerful.Oh, and the music. I'm no fan of country music, and I haven't had much exposure to Johnny Cash besides listening to the live prison album alluded to in the movie, but this is some very strong stuff. It's easy to imagine that miming and overrecording would have been used, but the mere fact that it wasn't just adds one of those indefatigable aspects of what makes this movie work so well.Then of course there's the directing and the cinematography. Specifically, if anyone's doubting the impactfulness of the work behind the camera, I argue to rewatch that long shot where Cash tears apart the bathroom. Watch how everything possible seems to be at full work here, movement, zoom, acting, makeup, set design, music, atmosphere, lighting, all targeted in such a way that it does not feel reasonable to assume that such a take could ever be done again, even if all the same mechanics were at work.Okay, so I've basically just hyped it up a whole lot more, adding to that same hype that has people tired and sick of the whole idea of the movie before they've seen it. Admit it, the mere fact that it's been nominated for some Oscars means that it already feels overrated. I know exactly what you mean......afterall, what made me wait to see it so long? But whatever. Think what you want. I think this film is pretty darned great. I'm just sayin'.--PolarisDiB",10,0,0,10 February 2006
Alien 3," Needn't be
","I seem to remember when I watched this a while ago that I really liked it, and also that it was one of the best in the series. It seems that I was really stupid back then.This movie is horrible. Awful. Terrible. I honestly was surprised at how poorly I reacted to it. I love Fincher, I love the Alien series, I have good memories of enjoying this movie, but this movie is still very poor.Apparently, it isn't much Fincher's fault that it didn't work out so well, what with the studio control issue and whatever, but a lot of what I find distasteful in this film is the Fincher element. This movie is very nihilistic, antimaterialistic, and strongly airs a lot of Fincher's later work. I wouldn't mind it so much, in fact I'd rather enjoy it, except that it messes up Ripley's character too much.In each movie she changes. In the first, she starts out almost completely genderless until the end while in the second she's very motherly. In this one, she's pretty much just despicable. In a way it makes sense... if you kept going through revolving periods of stasis and action--LITERALLY--you'd become a cynical nihilist as well. But this was overdone and unbelievable, not to mention ruined by her very out of character sleeping with the doctor. It doesn't fit, and it makes the ending even worse with her martyrism. Nothing's worse than a nihilist martyr.Anyway, it would make up for it with wonderful visuals if it weren't for the fact that the graphics have aged poorly. The CGI alien, though good for the time, is so bad by today's standards that it's ultimately unbelievable. It's sad that that has happened, but honestly there's no denying it. Apparently Fincher was trying for another psychological horror like the first one (an approach I agree with, considering the second one was pretty much a dull action film), but he shows too much and makes it too bloody. Most of the time the CGI wasn't even needed anyway. Whatever.Finally, I couldn't stand any of the other characters. Their religiosity, their Australian accents, all of that stuff really didn't add anything but a resounding sense of fatigue. It was a risky approach; if it succeeded it would have been awesome. It didn't.This is the worst part of the series.--PolarisDiB",2,485,516,1 September 2006
Source Code," By golly I think he's got it!
","Whereas it still may be too early to tell, I think Duncan Jones has GOT IT.This is a man who knows science fiction. He has currently made two of pretty much the best examples of the genre, but more importantly, he's doing it in a way contrary to the way most contemporary directors are trying to shine within genre filmmaking: he is not subverting it, mixing it, trying to rise above it--Duncan Jones is sticking to his premises and plying all the rules with a straight face. He is very referential, but takes care that the references are only gentle homage and that he uses them only if they fit the purpose of the movie.Let me put it this way: if this movie was made write-by-committee to be the genre film it is, the initial premise would become gimmick once several obvious options for flat and uninspired twists appear in the narrative, in the hopes that it would dazzle enough people to make money before everyone noticed that it doesn't make any sense. If it were made in the manner most contemporary but famous-name directors do (Nolan, this is me glaring at you), it would not keep itself contained to the science fiction and thriller aspects of what it's doing. Most importantly of all, however, the key is that what underlies everything going on here is a strict focus on the story. Anything else that doesn't fit, Duncan Jones doesn't do.Here's what I mean. Both Moon and Source Code involve an initial premise ripe with the danger of gimmick: in Moon, a man becomes slowly aware that he is a clone with an expiration date trapped on the Moon all alone; in Source Code, a man becomes slowly aware that he is a dead soldier being used in an experimental form of crime prevention involving quantum physics-based time travel (there's a bit of dialog in the movie that argues its not time travel, but for all intents and purposes, it is). In either movie both the premise, and the reveal that explains it, is delivered and clarified within the first third of the movie, with very little time wasted on exposition. Jones is not holding cards up his sleeve to wow the audience with magic tricks, he's laying out the hand early and letting the characters work with them. The rest of the movie follows their attempt to deal with their situation using whatever tools they have available. It's BRILLIANT.He's also keeping it small. Moon takes place entirely in a few sets with only two actors. Source Code is much bigger, but is still contained to, basically, a train, a train station, and a government facility. I would not be surprised if Jones' movies keep getting bigger, but I would be surprised if he loses his economy of sets, characters, and conceits. The point I'm stressing again and again is that this guy cuts out all the fat.Now comes the inevitable 'but'. I have to admit that there's a little more to be wished for in terms of the heavy, and his motivations. Since the story is much more focused on Gyllenhaal's character and his attempt to work through the very circumstance he finds himself in, it did not give Jones a lot of room to give much detail or development to the bomber that the character is eventually supposed to capture. The result is a rather lame high schooler who has just seen Fight Club for the first time and happens to have access to radioactive material. A little bland, I must say.But you know what? I don't care. This movie was great. If Jones peeved me in any way, it's in the attempt to differentiate the concept from time travel from the explanation given, a concise enough pseudoscience explanation operable for establishing the story if not entirely accurate itself, when he already refers in some sequences (especially the end) to movies like La Jetee (which I KNOW Zowie Bowie is aware of, considering his father's music video which is a direct spin-off of that film), which have pretty much established mental memory morality plays as a legitimate form of time travel long ago. That's the the time-travel geek in me getting a bit uppity, is all. I love you D-Jones, keep working the good work.--PolarisDiB",8,0,0,16 April 2011
The Ring," Meh! Meh...
","Remember when everyone was talking about this? Remember when it was, like, the scariest movie ever, and stuff? Man, am I glad that fad has passed.This decent but incomplete adaptation is also a decent and incomplete companion piece to the original Ringu. I consider a fan of Asian cinema, but Ringu was also a decent and incomplete film unto itself. That's pretty much the way to describe this entire series.Why does the ghost decide to inhabit the curse in a videotape (of all things, especially considering that this remake comes in the DVD era)? The answer can only be assumed. How does the tape come to exist? Well apparently it was first recorded by those teenagers up in the mountains, but then again, how did that urban legend then spread if it the teenager who dies in the beginning was one of the first and only ones to see it? But more importantly than plot holes... why do people think this movie is scary again? An answer shall never rise from the well.Anyway, as a production its pretty decent. Naomi Watts is as good as any movie she's in, which means she does pretty well but not spectacular here. Gore Verbinski is, I feel, a really good director, he just is caught in Hollywood doing stuff like this. Everyone gives their due and the movie itself goes along pretty well (in fact, I give it entertainment points for being funny, as the horse falling into the water scene is spectacular comedy). It's just that nothing in the proceedings really sticks or matters. It's a horror show that toned itself down enough to be handled by 13 year olds, which means it's pretty much refused the right to do anything really interesting at all.And if trippy videos scare people, why isn't avant-garde cinema taking off? Hey, Ring-fans: the works of Stan Brakhage, man. That stuff can kill you.--PolarisDiB",4,0,2,19 March 2007
I'm Not There," Hey look, a biopic that actually fits its subject!
","This film honestly could not have come sooner. Now that the world has 'Dewey Cox', the idea of the biopic as cliché (think about it, do artists lives ALWAYS follow that particular narrative arc?) has garnered its own momentum to literally standardize public figures lives into similar profiles. This movie evades and destroys this effect completely by throwing out veracity and accepting all of Bob Dylan's idiosyncratic messages, identities, stories, themes, and creative drives at face value, no matter how contradictory they may seem. The result is a movie that is possibly the 'truest' version of an artist's life: one that just says everything he does to represent himself is right, and builds up a much more interesting character than a single identity.Now, in terms of the various actors, they all do their due. Cate Blanchett and Christian Bale manage to project Dylan best by far, as they grab hold of his tics and his movements like dogs at raw meat and never let go. Todd Haynes also makes sure that the 'different' story-lines are inter-cut and layered so that no stress is given to a single 'character' and a much clearer understanding of Dylan's various identities as one identity is argued.That said, because of this approach, Haynes has the regrettable and understandably difficult job of trying to figure out where to start and where to end. Inevitably, 'I'm Not There' ended up running about a half an hour too long, something that could have been easily ignored except for how ultimately exhausting the movie is. HOWEVER, this movie is very experimental in the way that it uses cinematic devices to tie these seemingly contradictory approaches into a portrait that is at times spectacular, gorgeous, and compelling... and during a moment or two, manages to be all three! One particular point about Bob Dylan that should be noted and that this movie places emphasis on is his desire to evade classification. As shown quite graphically in 'I'm Not There', Dylan has alienated many of his own fans with his refusal to set himself on a single course. As a result, this movie itself can alienate a lot of viewers with its refusal to settle down to one direct theme or concept. Sometimes 'meaningfulness' comes almost into grasp, only to have the scene end and a completely different story continue where it last left off. The entire movie is 'in media res' as concerns where he came from and where he's going. In that way, 'I'm Not There' gratefully evades placing a sense of closure to an already idiosyncratic subject who is not yet dead.--PolarisDiB",7,5,6,6 February 2008
The Big Lebowski," Character-driven brilliance!
","This movie is very personal to me. The Coen Brothers have always been a favorite of my family and The Dude looks, acts, and talks exactly like my dead father.That said, my high score for this film is not just because I like it, but because it's excellent. I'm going to save the usual great directing, acting, cinematography, editing, and humor (all of which it has) and move into a few unique traits of this film that never cease to fascinate me no matter how many times I watch it.First of all, the dialog specifically. Move over, Tarantino and Kevin Smith, you have been owned. This dialog is faster, wittier, more real, and creates better characters through tangents than you could hope possible. Was the dialog even written down? Most of the time it seems the actors are just playing off each other's direction and they are talking about whatever they want to, and yet previous conversations and conceits and the like keep re-emerging later, characters go off on regular tangents (and I'm not just talking about the Vietnam War, either), and the actors never, ever fall out of character. It's amazing to behold.Secondly, the storyline's general arch. Many conversations I've had with people end up going into a lot of discussion over the fact that he never gets his rug back. In fact, the whole movie is kind of tragic in the way The Dude ends up worse off than he was before, but then again he's happier and the status quo has returned, so it's still contained brilliantly. The thing is that the Coen brothers tend to write very character-driven plots, where the character's personalities do so much more than the events they create to propel them into more and more absurd situations. Furthermore, it's not like the characters just move on to the next scene and the last scene is almost irregardless, like a lot of lesser character-driven plots: it all ties together and is contained beautifully. This movie could not have ended any other way.Finally, I won't bore you with the regular talk about how great a character The Dude is (even though he is), I want to talk about Walter Sobchack. Honestly, this the role John Goodman was born to do, and of course he did it brilliantly. Not only can I not imagine anyone else doing it, I can't imagine anybody else perfectly complimenting Dude. Together with Donnie, the three make a relationship so much more real than almost ever shown on screen.--PolarisDiB",10,2,3,29 October 2005
Akira," Singularity
","I expected to enjoy this, but I didn't expect quite the profound experience this movie was. Pretty much the best in post-apocalyptic, science fiction, animated entertainment, with hints of cyberpunk and strong attention to detail in both the script and drawing, Akira is pretty much penultimate anime. All of the characters are very realistic, the storyline is gripping, the voice acting (both Japanese and English versions, amazingly) is great, and the action is spectacular. For a full two hours, you get immersed in a very fleshed out world (no pun behind 'immersed' and 'fleshed out' intended...) and experience the transcendental energies of the Universe.One night a biker gang chasing another gang called the Clowns through the streets runs into (literally) a strange aged-looking little boy, right as public demonstrations on the street and military activity converge in Neo-Tokyo, the rebuilt metropolis of the area destroyed in 1988. Despite these disparate events, all of the elements of that fateful meeting come together as Tetsuo, the sidekick of bike-gang leader Kaneda, starts developing strange powers, attracting attention of the self-same military elements, a rogue subversive group, and of course Kaneda himself, who simply wants to figure out what happened to his friend (and also is just a little attracted to Kay, one of the subversives). It all has to do with something called Akira, which resides underneath a stadium being built and organized for the Olympics 30. Also, in the process of each character attempting to discover what's going on, corporate plots will be unraveled, governmental coups will be performed, and the landscape of Neo-Tokyo will change for a second time.Within the animated elements as well there are gorgeous metropolitan landscapes, surreal hallucinatory effects, dazzling environments, and magical realism. I've heard that there are talks going around to make this movie into a live-action, but though CGI effects have developed enough to pull off any of the separate visual effects featured in this movie, their synthesis could never be quite as great as the way this movie looks and moves, especially since live-action bodies wouldn't really belong to the landscape that this movie creates. As a completely idiosyncratic, fully developed piece of art, Akira is really inimitable.--PolarisDiB",10,1,4,10 October 2009
Citizen Kane," The greatest dull movie ever made.
","When watching a film, the average viewer comes to expect a few things. They expect a beginning, a middle, and an end. They expect building drama and a climax. In this film, they get both, only the film itself is the drama and climax--the beginning, middle, and end--and not the story.Orson Welles takes all of his talents in radio, theatre, and writing and tackles a new genre, the cinema. In the process, he does things unheard of in contemporary techniques and stuns critics... well, a few of them. Most of the critics and the general audience 'didn't get it', so to speak. That of course doesn't stop its fame, for it has another pull that keeps it alive for years before it becomes embraced fully: a nice helping of controversy, both with the 'outrageous' techniques and the, uh, political commentary.Today, we have a film that will never die and shouldn't. Breaking traditions in more ways than one, Welles has assembled celluloid with more poetry than what has come to be expected of cinema both then and now. Still, poetry isn't always liked, and contemporary audiences may have issue with the general dullness of the story, for after all, the career of Welles and the controversy of the film are sparks and explosions, the Rosebud mystery is the intrigue, and the importance is the art-value, but the movie itself trudges along, hardly leaving room for any entertainment.Part of this is intentional, and used to great effect. The movie is, after all, about failure, and regardless of how many times we watch it, it is begun and end with 'No Trespassing'. One problem modern audiences may definitely have is understanding that this film doesn't even pretend to answer its own mystery, despite the so-called revelation at the end. It's an exploration film where the exploration is the finale, without goal. Because of the perfection of the failure theme, the movie leaves the audience just as empty as the characters... and then what is the audience supposed to do with it? Thus, it all becomes a matter of approach. This film should be seen, but it doesn't necessarily have to be appreciated. It's worthy of its place as a critically-acclaimed classic, and yet it's still debatable whether it is worth it.--PolarisDiB",9,1,4,29 September 2005
Inglourious Basterds," And dirtier and dirtier
","The original Inglorious Bastards had the tag-line, 'Everything the Dirty Dozen did, they did it dirtier!' Other than that, Inglorious Bastards had next to nothing to do with The Dirty Dozen. Quentin Tarantino's Inglourious Basterds has little to do with Inglorious Bastards, minus a generalized subplot that is more like a synopsis. Instead, it is a lot closer to a remake of The Dirty Dozen, complete with a few word-by-word lines (such as the whole 'All of our rotten eggs in one basket--and we're going to blow up the basket') and the same vaguely moral-disturbing ending in the name of committing Nazis to carnage.Otherwise, the movie is somewhat of a mis-sell. The trailers and the title have it that this movie is about Brad Pitt's character and his fun-loving Yank-accented Nazi hunting, but actually the bulk of this movie is a vengeance plot involving one Shosanna, daughter of a murdered Jewish family who finds herself in key position to eliminate all of the heads of the Nazi party in one explosion of burning celluloid (and I'm speaking literally, here). The Inglourious Basterds running around the country-side just provide a little extra bang for your buck (again, speaking literally), and in the same way, the real emotional base of the movie is Shosanna whereas the Basterds are mostly, well, comedic relief.Except they're not funny. They're monsters. But that's all 'c'est la guerre.' It's not even really worth getting into the specifics of why these people should be detested rather than appreciated, because nobody cares, so I won't even bother. It's just now that I've sat with audience members laughing at the borderline personality in 'Observe and Report', cheering the sociopathic Rorschach in 'Watchmen', and applauding the megalomaniacal Basterds in this flick, I'm feeling modern audiences are becoming severely poor judges of character.Anyway, Tarantino refines his logocentric palate with a few more languages (and has some fun with them, hopefully to the chagrin of a few subtitle-phobic audience members expecting more Sam Jackson/John Travolta tete-a-tete), some very tense moments build based on the use of said languages (refreshing), and eventually Shosanna's vengeance narrative comes to a very satisfying close--and one that may not be quite what you expect. Meanwhile, the movie is laced with slightly more oblique movie-references than usual, providing extra interest to those trivia geeks out there. Indeed, this is still Tarantino being in top form, a real testament to his skills as a director if not a particularly 'good' movie per se. Minus a few b-movie references and sight gags, the faux-serial structure (which actually didn't make much sense), and the Basterds themselves, this is a very tense and original WWII thriller. Add those things and this is back into pastiche-land, a not-unenjoyable place where some things might not really fit, but it's all done for love.--PolarisDiB",6,3,8,6 September 2009
Kickboxer," Cheapy video classic
","So this would be classic Van Damme. A young man watching his brother getting crippled by a muay thai fighter vows ULTIMATE VENGEANCE! and goes to the villa of a master thai fighter to train for his final revenge in the box. Um, along the way he finds someone to love. Finally, near the end, things are ramped up a bit as his girl-to-be is raped and his brother kidnapped in an effort to destroy his chances against a highly bet-upon contest, but he kicks ass, takes name, gets the girl, all that.During the watching of most of this movie, I was wondering why so many people buy this movie even to this date, while much better action movies have been made before and since and the deathly 80s pall of egregious music and terrible hairdos makes this movie so laughably kitsch. It's because of the end; I kinda 'smagine most people just skip right to it, as it has some pretty good choreography and the whole ground glass thing adds some nice intensity. The rest of the movie is capable enough, though predictable and in a lot of moments pretty boring. At least they don't waste too much time on dialog, just getting to what needs to be done to get Kurt boy trained for his bigboy fight. Still, the movie could have used a bit more pep and a bit less pizazz.--PolarisDiB",4,1,5,8 March 2009
Alien: Resurrection," Well, okay then...
","*Sigh*... and here is where I ruin all of the other reviews I've written, all of any objective respectability, and imagined audience I probably didn't have in the first place.I liked it. A lot. In fact I think it's the best film in the series.Outrage! Horror! How could he say that when he says Alien 3 is terrible! I can say it because this movie is fun, it's very visually amazing, and best of all, it's complete. Joss Whedon has done an excellent job with this, something most people didn't notice probably because they were too distracted by Winona Ryder's terrible acting and the huge change in Ripley's character, along with a good ol' fashioned distrust of modern sequels, to notice that he has tied together some open threads that have existed basically from the very beginning.The thing I want to remark upon, that is, stress very importantly, is that Ripley's life throughout the Alien films is very horrible. It's an obvious assessment, but so obvious it's not often noted. She literally exists, by this film, to fight the aliens... there's almost no other purpose to her life. In fact her past is utterly removed at this point. She and the aliens have become a continuing conflict of good and evil, and it's gone so far that she's literally become a part of the alien world. So Whedon actually makes her an alien and the aliens a part of her. It's brilliant, really.Secondly, I think this film is a lot of fun. Ron Perlman and Dominique Pinon, Jeunet regulars, make wonderful supporting characters to Sigourney Weaver's new interpretation of the cynically stuck Ripley, the Ripley who went from androgynous to motherly to nihilist to an almost perfect conglomeration of all three in this last film. Other supporting actors are very well-placed too, such as the guy from The Crow and Dan Hedaya.Jeunet's visual activity is in full force here as well. I have to laugh and admit that it's completely over the top... and yet with the excellent cast it makes it more fun than the action bonanza of the second and more interesting than the brooding nihilism of the third. There's no attempt to be the first one with psychological horror. There's no attempt to be the second one with masses of aliens everywhere. There's just a defining compromise: a dozen of them. And mystery as to what their motivations, at this point, really are.There's a lot that needn't be in here, too much. It's too modern, the alien/human hybrid at the end is pretty ridiculous (though I still think a good continuation of what has been happening between Ripley and the aliens), too much modern fear of cloning, and too many characters trying to be 'bad-ass'. I can understand entirely why people hate this movie so. But I still think it's really good.It also has the perfect ending to the series. Ripley returns to Earth, and it's at this point that it should be noted: we have never seen Earth throughout all of the movies, and yet the whole reason why Ripley seems to exist is to protect it. It's transcendent, it's remarkable, and it's a beautiful scene. Remember that this is four hundred years and four stases since Ripley left Earth merely as a cargo carrier. She's been through a lot, and now look what she's become... This is why I think this is a really good movie.Bring on the neggies. I guess I deserve it.--PolarisDiB",8,1,3,1 September 2006
Au Revoir les Enfants," Malle's masterpiece
","I've seen this movie twice, and in the context of the situations I've seen them provides two good ways to approach this film, so I'll do both.The first context was when I saw it in French class in high school. Beyond just being the typical 'movie during class!' experience, I thought it was pretty amazing anyway: the two children actors who play Julien and Bonnet are extremely talented and perfectly encapsulate two children of the period, the story is heart-felt and visceral at the same time, and the ending has a tendency to stick in ones conscience.At the very least you have that. But in the context of the 3 Films of Louis Malle box set released through Criterion, it has its own aspect of interest. The first is how it combines the two themes of the previous two films, coming-of-age and the German occupation of France, into what Malle seems to be wanting to talk about all along. The most important thing is that this time it's true. You don't even need to research that, you can feel it as you watch.Not that it isn't without it's stylizations of cinema, but that's what makes it great. Especially amazing is the fear that runs throughout it, even in smaller scenes. The two key moments involving this fear, though, are especially great: the woods and the end. The woods are mostly childish fear, illusive and imagined, yet it gets the spectator's heart pounding. The end is real, and thus much more disturbing and helpless. The change in maturity of the character moves from an abstract ('I think about death all the time') to a concrete ('I'll remember every second of that day for the rest of my life'), and yet the feeling of fear through an artist's mind is still a drive to create something as strong and engaging as this work.--PolarisDiB",9,8,10,7 August 2006
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," How to make a successful sequel
","Trying to make a successful sequel is an interesting thing. There's a lot of expectation, but where the expectation comes from is contradictory--on one hand, everyone expects the same characters and the same general quality as the first movie; on the other hand, they don't want the same movie with repetitive, tired jokes. In a movie like Pirates of the Caribbean, which is very popular mostly by force of its interesting and dynamic characters, that line is a bit harder to hit because everyone is attached to the characters, but don't want them to ever really be damaged.I would say then that this is a very successful sequel. It doesn't necessarily rely upon the first movie, but a lot of what is going on is very aware of the first movie's influence on these characters. It brings back almost all of the characters, major and minor, from the previous movie, but it does accept the task of taking the time to develop them. In a sense, a lot of what happens in this film could be considered unnecessary pandering towards icon recognition. In the opposite sense, this movie seems willing to take risks with character development that might not be agreeable. I personally consider the two to even themselves out and create a sufficiently self-contained movie experience.A major issue with the film is its ultimate tie-in with the next sequel. This movie, like The Matrix Reloaded, is a bridge between two different movies that deal with different issues. It would probably behoove any potential viewers of this movie to understand that while it has a sort of climax, it doesn't really have a complete story-arch. Don't go expecting to have the complete story else you will be very disappointed. Go to see where the next movie will take you and figure out where the character development is going.Many have said that this film is 'dark'. I don't really consider a lot of the imagery darker than the original... this one does seem to like its Eldritch horror, but what really makes this movie less light and enjoyable than the first is that for the first time, we see the characters (and especially Jack Sparrow) at their very weakest. Throughout the first movie there's a sense even when things seem to be in conflict that the character's overall capability will eventually work itself out. In this movie, the characters themselves are completely unsure of themselves (the compass, anyone?). This development is actually why I really like this movie by itself: we know Jack the graceful but klutzy looking sort-of-drunk, but now we get to see Jack the nothing seems to be working out serious captain. We also know Elizabeth and Will the lovers, but now we get them not quite knowing what they're doing for each other as well. Because it's such a big change from what they were in the first movie, it does seem almost necessary to have them resolve it over two more movies.The idea of forcing it into two movies is kind of depressing to me; technically, there is no rule that says a movie must be between one and a half and two hours long. A movie could be a stunning narrative and still be five hours long. However, Hollywood does know audience impatience, and as many people have said about this movie: 'It starts to get a bit long...' Nobody seems willing to sit down to watch a complete four-hour narrative, so instead they are more willing to pay the price of two tickets. If that's the way their time is valued, that's the way their time is valued, and I don't think I can really do much about that.So for what it is, this is a very good movie. The strong parts are the ideas behind the character development (though I still don't think Knightley nor Bloom really have that much ability to carry the weight of serious acting on their shoulders) and the very inventive action. The swashbuckling is presented to quite an extreme degree here, and a lot of it is actually quite surprising in where it goes.Go out and enjoy it. Most everyone else is.--PolarisDiB",5,3,10,11 July 2006
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," Depp and Rush shine
","Everybody likes pirates! (Well, not the music industry, but whatever...) Johnny Depp shines as Captain Jack Sparrow, a cleverly klutzy pirate who is in search for the Black Pearl and the crew that mutinied it from him. Leader of the mutineers is Captain Barbossa, a mean dirty pirate with a curse that sends him searching for the pieces of some ancient Aztec gold... and the blood of a good pirate's son.It also involves a side story about that young son (Will Turner, played by Orlando Bloom) and the love of his life (Elizabeth Swann, played by Keira Knightley), but nobody cares.Honestly, Johnny Depp MADE the movie. His perfect characterization of a quirky swashbuckler is both funny and memorable. His personality and charisma shines from screen to screen as he tries to figure out how to get what he wants when everybody else seems to be against him.Depp by himself, though, would have made for a strained and bad movie indeed. Even a good actor with a good character can be dire and silly in a movie that doesn't compliment them. Thus we have Geoffrey Rush's Barbossa, the driven evil that compliments Depp's Sparrow well. Rush obviously had a lot of fun with the role and it's a real joy to see him, especially when working off of Depp.It also has some pretty good dialog, stuff to make you laugh in between action moments. Very quotable, stuff like, 'Where's the rum?' which is bound to stay in fanboy lingo for ages to come.--PolarisDiB",8,2,6,29 October 2005
12 Angry Men," Great directing supports strong performances
","For a movie based mostly in the necessity for repetition and seeing both sides of the issue, it does not, like it would seem, make one tired of hearing the phrase 'beyond a reasonable doubt.' This is an issue of objectivity, the idea that has taken centuries of philosophers to finally understand doesn't exist in a subjective standpoint. I can say nothing about this film that isn't repeated, with full clarity, in the dialog under many different contexts. They hold a man's life in their hands, and in the process are going to learn a lot about what must go into the proof.To be a bit honest, and a little hesitant, I must say that a lot of it strikes me as pretty liberal. I think this film is strongest when it doesn't get into politics, so the constant repetition of the phrase 'bleeding heart' kind of gets to me. However, it's something of a necessity, because one of the things that these characters have to overcome is personal politics and prejudice to figure out where exactly to take a stand and where to leave be. And as a product of its time, it's immensely profound.What I like most about it is that it is not a criticism of the American system, it's actually in full support of it. If it criticizes anything, it criticizes the people who take it aloofly and don't understand the power they hold when they operate within said system. Responsibility is something I personally find quite lacking currently, and it's nice to see a movie expound the virtues of personal responsibility towards lawful conduct. This does not mean falling into hegemonic status quo, for that would mean the boy dies because nobody takes the time to question him. This means making sure you understand what you know and what you can't know.Beyond the writing itself, the directing and the acting really shine. It must be appallingly difficult to shoot an entire movie in such a small space, but Lumet does it superbly and the camera shows the audience EXACTLY what it needs to know when it needs to know it. It's art to be beheld. Also, all of the actors maintain their characters and the characters' mood swings amazingly, making it fluid and above all, very real.--PolarisDiB",9,1,2,3 April 2006
The Notebook," Character issues...
","I think, for me, this movie can illustrate some of the difficulties in creating a romance drama that is very effective. This movie is a finely crafted and beautiful work of art. The story and the film-making are keen on providing a sense of profound happiness and energy into the concept of love, one that is both healing and outgoing.However, some various problems arose for me with the exposition of the characters. I was simply not attracted to either of the characters. They got together too quickly, too loudly, and from there I couldn't really feel love for them even though I could feel their love for each other. Does this fall into personal taste, or does this fall into shortcomings of the story? Well let's take a look, for a moment, at how they got together, that scene with the ferris wheel. It was loud, it was out there, and it was pretty obnoxious, honestly. Does it connect with us, the viewers, at a level where Noah's actions are reflections of what we secretly desire to do, to climb and to jump and to yell and to make sure she promises to notice us at all costs? Or is it simply brash and contrived, a character that is so outgoing that he represents anybody who is impulsive, albeit completely honest about his feelings and completely persistent in his emotions? Or Allie, is she honestly someone that guys would fall in love with, the person we can imagine as 'The One?' Of course at this point somebody will probably think I'm reading too much into them, or I'm just not accepting the movie for what it is, or anything along that line, but in the nature of film criticism I want to ask, what is the purpose of movies like these? As an entertainment medium, it connects us with the idea of 'love', the one, the search for that precise person that the two characters find in each other that loves each other and can love forever, something that is needed especially since the world gets so cynical now.So why am I just completely not in love with those characters? It's a good movie. What I liked especially were the opening shots and that entire scene involving the swans and the rain, which were indeed very romantic. The story was very touching. I just didn't like the characters. I think the real dilemma is that they had too much dialog. Sometimes they spoke when honestly they should have been a bit quieter; and I'm not talking about the first sex scene. That scene was actually one of the movie's strongest moments, one that was more honest about the anxieties for those two young lovers and the implications of what they were doing. I'm talking about moments in the film where all the characters needed to do was share a look, and instead they shared some dialog and it brought me away from the idea that they were truly connected on a deeper level.--PolarisDiB",7,3,6,10 February 2006
Public Enemies," Technique in trade
","People, especially critics, were all up in a tizzy because Michael Mann shot this movie in HDV and it's a period piece. This doesn't actually matter unless you're the type of person who believes that the world pre-1960 existed in tones of brown, like most period pieces are shot. That said, the hand-held cinematography was uneven and the editing was pretty poor, indeed, but that has nothing to do with the camera itself, which captured images that looked great.As for the story itself, it was pretty good, though like many stories of its type it ended up actually suffering for the love side-plot, which helped stretch the movie to roughly about 20 minutes over its justifiable playlength. Still, the acting was superb and there are some pretty surreal action scenes, plus great prison escape sequences. It was also nice seeing Johnny Depp not play someone quite so flamboyant, kinda a throwback to his Donnie Brasco character but with variance. Most important, the sub-plot involving the technological, ethical, and social changes occurring in America at the time and their interrelatedness was very interesting.For Michael Mann lovers, this is probably another win. For everyone else, I can't say I wasn't entertained. The violence might get to some people but neither side (Dillinger's crew and the FBI) are romanticized better or worse than the other. Like in Heat, you kinda want both sides to win.--PolarisDiB",6,1,2,21 August 2009
Oldboy," Interesting mix of influence and new cinema
","After a night of drinking, a man is imprisoned by some unknown people and left there for 15 years until he's let out. After a while trying to readjust to society and figure out what's happened, he is given 5 days to wreak vengeance upon whoever took his life away from him. Unfortunately, the progress is being watched by a less than benevolent spectator.What's interesting about this film is it's influences. It's based loosely around The Count of Monte Cristo, takes a lot of Shakespearian and Biblical elements, throws in typical Asian kung fu, and then puts it into a very modern stylistic context in terms of cinema. The best part about this movie's style is that it never actually feels overdone and it actually seems to make sense... a shot isn't canted just to be weird, it's more subtle than that, even if the tone itself bleeds the idea of style.Honestly, I was taken simply by a single shot, a long take where the camera tracks along a hallway as the main character fights off a large group of people. It straddles the line between realism and romance and creates a destructive ballet of choreography and motion that is downright beautiful in a somewhat horrible way. Then setting it into the context it has to a rather well done and structured story really helps this movie have a profound effect on the viewer. Just don't expect to be coming out of this feeling very happy, as it gets a bit disturbing at the end.It may have overdone the ending, but I don't care. The weird mix of hypnosis and not-hypnosis kind of constricted the story. It is interesting to note that this film is of a new group of films out there that a few people call Asian Extreme Cinema, and I've seen two other films from this neo-genre that involve heavy use of violence and hypnosis themes (and men cutting their own tongues out). Why do these images seem to tie this genre together? What is it about hypnosis, specifically, that creates an anxious desire in these filmmakers for broken vigilantes? --PolarisDiB",10,12,85,2 December 2005
Superbad," Their last true moment
","Judd Apatow has become a big household name in a relatively amount of time, as he's written, produced, and directed seemingly dozens of movies over the past couple of years, most of them widely respected by critics and really loved by fans; and yet, nothing with his name connected to it yet has really impressed me that much until Superbad. With a plot that sounds like American Pie but concerns that go far beyond it, Greg Mottola and crew begin what first seems to be another smart-ass teenager flick, but lead it into some tender and relatively unexplored territory of male friendship in contemporary times.Michael Cera and Jonah Hill are Seth and Evan (non-coincidentally sharing names with the two writers), high school buddies essentially tied to the hips in a strange alternate dimension where kids are allowed to enter classes, talk to buddies, and leave pretty much as they will. They want sex; they are leaving for college soon and to separate schools, nonetheless; and their friend Fogell has acquired a fake ID just in time for Seth and Evan to accept an invitation to a party. Unfortunately, they're also klutzes, and Fogell himself is somewhat of a joke with his fake ID dubbing him the now famous and over-quoted ironic tee-shirt du jour, 'I am McLovin!' But that's all the set-up. Then the movie actually gets good.Y'see, due to some strange circumstances, poor decisions, and a little of the old bad timing, McLovin ends up under the wings of two police officers (Seth Rogan NEVER having been funnier, and Bill Hader), Seth and Evan end up with a creepy guy taking them to a party way beyond their maturity, and a lot of distance between them and their goal of being the ultimate saviors of the party. As they wander over the empty nighttime streets in a strange alternate Universe where no parents are ever around to recognize them, they are forced to confront their impending maturity while dropping their witty facades and coming to terms with their friendship and reliance of each other. And there's hilarious drinking and sex talk, too.The ironic thing is that where Seth and Evan's story is really much more of the point of the movie, and a lot more intimate, it's McLovin's guidance into adulthood by two cops that simply want to reclaim their childhood that is the more remembered and talked about segments, and my own personal favorite. It's a wish-fulfillment fantasy culminating in free shots and a burning police car, and it all feels a bit more satisfying than the longing separation look shared by the actual leads during the final scene of the movie. On the technical level, however, it's the main relationship between Seth and Evan that makes Superbad just a little more interesting and lasting than escapist entertainment meant to make a buck and be forgotten.The movie is a little strange in that parents, true authority, boundaries are practically nonexistent except as a means of making a couple snide jokes. The world Evan and Seth and Fogell live is really not the real world, but that's kind of the point: it's their last chance to essentially trip and hop fences their way to their desires before it's time for them to grow up and gain pesky things like responsibilities. Everyone has their last great summer and such. It's a staple of the American coming-of-age story.--PolarisDiB",8,0,2,14 September 2008
Hot Fuzz," How to make a real parody, not package pop culture regurgitation into commodity
","Genre parody is running rampant currently, probably because Hollywood is so out of ideas at this point that they've gone down to the level of making fun of their own crap with even more crap that basically every year we get another slew of pop culture regurgitation in the form of Genre Movie and kids films like Shrek, Happily N'Ever After, and Hoodwinked to make sure nothing worth seeing doesn't have its hilarious counterpart. That is why we need people like Simon Pegg and Edgar Wright.The thing about Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz is that both of them manage to make fun of, respect, AND transcend their own genres. Shaun of the Dead isn't just a funny reworking of zombie horror flicks, its a damn good zombie horror flick in its own right, and also breaks new ground with the genre. The exact same thing is true with Hot Fuzz. Where any sarcastic Hollywood genre satire would try to show how dumb a clichÃ© is by making it even more outrageous, Edgar Wright simply has the characters say, 'But that would create a lot of paperwork.' Where a lesser parody would make an obvious twist as a nod to obvious twists, Simon Pegg finds out that the motivations for the recent crimes is really much simpler.But beyond that, these films are good films, removed from genre, in their own right. Hot Fuzz uses a style of quick-cut editing to match the ridiculous quick-cut editing that's become popular in such ridiculous nonsensical films as Domino and Walking Tall, but they don't over extend it to show how ridiculous it can get... rather, they learn something about the form and most importantly make the editing extremely, extremely good. Hot Fuzz has quick saturated action film editing, but it does it in a way that leads the eye gracefully through the action, thus one upping every other bad action flick being ground out by Hollywood.But the best part is that these films don't need prior knowledge of other films in order to get the joke. A more underhanded reason so many Scary Movie sequels keep coming out is that they directly make fun of recent horror films one-to-one, meaning one must actually see those terrible movies in order to get the jokes. Hot Fuzz stands alone. Even if you haven't seen Bad Boys II or Point Break, you can still follow this movie because it has engaging and colorful characters, good action, and most importantly--CREATIVITY. And even though it provides constant nods to pop culture, it also has its own quirky form of English humor to basically make everybody laugh. Not only does Hot Fuzz transcend buddy cop movies and slasher flicks (with a hint of Westerns, too!), it also transcends spoof genre. Take that, Hollywood! I figured Shaun of the Dead was a one-time deal, but now I hope Simon Pegg and Edgar Wright continue to craft even more genres into actually skillful and fun movies for years to come.--PolarisDiB",9,21,33,4 May 2007
Brokeback Mountain," An achievement in its own way
","Two cowboys in Wyoming are just looking for work when one day they happen to get the same job herding sheep about Brokeback Mountain. For a while it's a day-in, day-out job as they slowly get tired of beans, but then, one cold night, they get a bit drunk, they get a bit confused, and the next thing you know they're in love but don't know how to deal with it. The story follows their lives over the years as they try and manage families, keep their secrets, and yet still find time to see each other despite living in different states and having completely different lives.It's a slow, but beautiful build-up to their relationship, and then once it gets its momentum and finally starts moving, the film just gets better and better. Compliments, of course, are towards the performers (including the supporting actors) and the direction, and a lot of this films mythic quality is on the absolutely gorgeous shooting of the Brokeback Mountain area, the only really open area shown in the film--obviously because Ennis and Jake feel rather restricted by the normal world around them.It's a good conceit, and a good theme, and tales of forbidden love and social commentary are great too. Unfortunately, this movie isn't free from its moments of camp... like in the tent, when Jake and Ennis are looking at each other and I couldn't help thinking, 'But baby, a man's got needs!' Or the shot of the gutted sheep, and all the time it allows around it for one to think, 'Well ain't ever'one feelin' gutted today?' Or when Jake and his wife are out with the society couple and the woman is talking about 'Men never ask their wives to dance,' and of course the obvious response would be something like, 'Well that's 'cause I want to dance with your man!' I'd cite more examples, but I'd neither want to spoil it or completely ruin it for you, for afterall, unintentional humor aside, the story just keeps getting more and more involving until it finally hits it's real stride, with some pretty unforgettable moments and unforgettable emotion. Thus it is, in its own way, quite an achievement. Even nice little touches like the fireworks behind Ennis when he gets angry at the bikers and some rather abstract shots in the beginning keep this film engaging enough to ask us, gently, to have patience with it until it gets to where it's been meaning to go.--PolarisDiB",7,5,14,27 February 2006
Ed Wood," Alternative Hollywood iconography
","I rewatched this just now and holy hell, it's better than I remember it! Ed Wood speaks to the passionate cinema loving man-child in all of us, who just cannot play it straight with the big guys and has to live the independent route--even if he does suck. I would not be surprised if positive reception of Ed Wood's movies post-1994 stem entirely from Johnny Depp's charismatic depiction of him. I certainly know this movie lead me to Ed Wood's films (by the way, this is the first time I watched this movie since I've seen them. It's worth noting that I actually really like Glen or Glenda for precisely the reasons stated in this movie--because it was honest, even if he had no idea what he was doing and wasn't smart enough to know how to make it acceptable for other people).Oh God, and the acting! Martin Landau as Bela Legosi is downright chilling. Lisa Marie as Vampira is friggin' amazing! Vincent D'Onofrio as Orson Welles nailed it! This movie is all about its own kind of iconography, the pulp we grew up with (too bad Burton's Mars Attacks isn't as good).Everyone has a lot of fun, and the writing is snappy and believable--this movie is everything Ed Wood wanted to be, and it's almost heart-wrenching to think that he eventually got it, but through no effort of his own, but through Tim Burton's. Oh, and it's nice seeing Burton work without Danny Elfman; Howard Shore does a great job and hits the beats exactly! --PolarisDiB",10,1,1,27 January 2010
Juno," A probably unnecessary pre-emptive argument
","These days, Indie-wood movies involving quirky characters and certain sensibilities reflected by their prominent musical choices are a dime a dozen. So how can I convince you that this one is somehow different, that this one has warmth, humor, and intelligence, and that it stands out? Mostly, it's popularity is a decent argument: this movie has been pretty well received by both audiences and critics alike, giving it a devoted following. Unfortunately, there's also the tendency with situations like that for people to way raise their expectations and then hate it because everyone else likes it, and for once I'd rather that not happen. But as a single reviewer out there, I also kind of distrust myself to try to convince for the Universal appeal to it because, well, for once in my life I watched a movie where I got all of the music references! And I was one of the few (two, that is) people in the audience to laugh out loud at that Sonic Youth quip.But here's what I have to say about this film to those wary of the over-saturated nature of movies about sarcastic teenagers. One: this movie features a pregnant teenager, but is not a pregnant teenager movie (the baby solves no pre-existing problems, creates no questions into the value of life, and doesn't really change the character beyond her usual teen discovering of self). Two: this movie features a lot of Indie music, but it is not, as some people have already attempted to call it, 'A Moldy Peaches music video.' Three: Think you see a cliché coming? Wait five minutes, it won't happen. And Four: it may be quotable, but thank the makers, it is NOT Napoleon Dynamite.What this movie has that most of the movies it's compared to doesn't have is lack of brooding self-seriousness, spot-on writing, and the perspective of an absolutely lovable character who really has little problems at all--only a desire to be cool and work things out, which is much more beautiful than worry over hormones and meaning-of-life stuff. It has a few stumbling blocks--it's book-ended by a ridiculous device involving seats, the first scene in the convenience store is the only one that feels like it's trying too hard--but anyone who can relate to the voice of Juno the character and narrator can relate to anything about this movie, and it's pretty open. The dialog is, in fact, so brilliant because it isn't searching for quotability or lowest-common-denominator relatability, but it's also not bone-dry humor and totally obscure referencing (though I did already bring up the issue with the music). It's... *GASP*...GENUINE! Anyway, I'm glad that this movie is getting so much initial appreciation, I'm just worrying about the inevitable 'Mannnn, that movie was soooo overrated and I'm too cool for it' lashback, because Juno the movie only wants two things: to be cool, and work things out. So hey man, be cool, and sit back and let things work themselves out.--PolarisDiB",9,6,14,10 January 2008
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," How to make a successful trilogy.
","Here's how contemporary trilogies work: the first movie introduces characters and circumstances that capture the imagination. The second movie goes by the rule 'the same, only more of it'. The third movie has the same rule as the second movie, but this time it twists the situations around a bit more and organizes the characters differently. Often the third film is known as 'darker than the other two' (have you ever noticed how often that happens?). Thus, we have Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End, the almost three-hour action adventure story featuring Jack Sparrow.I like it! But then again, who doesn't? It's exactly what it promises to be, and that's what makes it good. The rule of thumb for this situation is, if you liked the other two, then you'll like this one. If you didn't like the other two, then why are you even taking the time to read a review of this one? C'mon man, it's more of the same! Just go out to see it like you're supposed to.Anyway, the plot is a little lengthy and convoluted to detail in this space at this moment (plus I'm still a little exhausted from it, so it's kind of hard to write all that much about it), but the whole company is back and battling the forces of evil, which I think is the trading company and their new merger, The Flying Dutchman, but since the ongoing joke is that pirates are only self-interested, really it's more like a continuous saga of bickering with each other. Captain Barbossa is back, but unfortunately Geoffrey Rush and Johnny Depp aren't given as much time to be foils to each other, which is literally the relationship that set off the series and really made the first movie so much fun to watch. However, at least there's enough Jack to go around and have seconds, and best of all, there's the scene where Jack goes slowly insane... which is one of the most fun and funniest moments in contemporary mainstream cinema! I loved it! If there's anything I would really say is 'poor' about this movie, it would be the unfortunate tendency of the music to play over the dialog. Actually, on that note, I'd really appreciate it if somebody could e-mail me and tell me what, precisely, giant Calypso was saying, as I kind of want to know and was very disappointed when I couldn't hear past that 'Womm woomm grarrr raaahhh!' tempestual voice she had.--PolarisDiB",5,4,6,18 June 2007
Spider-Man 3," No, it's actually really bad
","Most other reviews have been very good at pointing out that this movie is 'over-stuffed' and 'weighed down', but most other reviewers have been way too kind. This movie is ridiculous. Simply stated, any movie that thinks a hero donning an emo-swoop is a key dramatic moment deserves to be scoffed at.But emo-bashing popularity aside, this movie is still bad. A third of this movie (namely, the Sandman situation), should have been cut entirely, and I mean entirely. It did nothing to serve the plot and characters, until Raimi contrived a reason involving ol' Uncle Ben's death, which has been upsetting to Spider-Man fans of all types--but still doesn't do anything for non-fans either.Secondly, the resolving of the lengthy three-film arch of Peter and Harry would probably have been a good service to the characters, minus the horrible, HORRIBLE moment of selective amnesia on the side of Harry. If anyone took that and the subsequent relationship between them seriously, then they deserve to be served the fluff Hollywood is pumping out these days. Awful.And thirdly, importantly, comparing this movie to the Schumacher Batmans isn't that far-fetched, considering it's overindulgence of narrative lines that eventually culminate in a weighed-down and uninteresting story of too-much-villain. No single entity in this movie except for Peter Parker and Mary Jane are given enough of a complete development to even be given sufficient screen-time (Gwen Stacy literally disappears when she's not needed, and something some reviewers don't mention often is that she's only one of THREE love interests in this film, another aspect the movie didn't need).As I understand it, Raimi, Maguire, and Dunst have a pretty poor working relationship. I think it shows. Everyone looks tired, uninterested, and frustrated. Even the special effects seem rubbery and lazy, as everyone rushes to just finish up their part. As duly noted by fanboys of various types, only Bruce Campbell shows some real energy... but that's because he's Bruce Campbell, and he's awesome, and everyone knows it.Leave this movie for rental or a dollar theatre. It's successful because it's a franchise, and darned be the people who don't do their civic duty in seeing it so that everyone can be cultural aware in shared mediated experience. And yes, there will be more sequels. They may not have the same people in them (but considering the money, it's still possible), but as long as we have a self-functioning profit like this, why let it go? --PolarisDiB",3,0,1,14 May 2007
The Prestige," Awesome sleight-of-hand
","Magic tricks and cinema share a lot of properties with each other in several ways, the two biggest being the way of leading an audience along towards a surprise and focusing the audience on a distraction while using sleight of hand to conjure up something surprising. They both have a long history in perceptions, demons, and the occult. They're both logical when revealed, and yet despite such revealing audiences are willing to return to see a show over and over and over again.These days it's no special deal to try and trick the audience... Mr. Shyamalan has decided to permanently affix his career to it. Unfortunately, sometimes the attempt to out-dazzle the audience (and thus sell tickets) leads in a lack of performance from the magicians responsible. In this case, however, everyone throws in their due and we're treated to a stage that's absolutely magical.I've never previously understood why people put so much stock into Christian Bale--I saw that he was good but I didn't think he was fantastic--until now. I'd say he's the sole reason to go see this movie, if it wasn't for Hugh Jackman's acting. I can't speak of either in terms of actor/supporting actor... there is no difference between their importance, and this movie is so full of doppelgangers you might as well just sit back and be prepared to see double. The two of them are amazing.Nolan has definitely evolved as a director and shows it here with a much more hidden role. He's definitely the Man behind the Curtain and not self-conscious in his directing, and this film's use of broken chronology is much more structurally sound than Memento and other out-of-order works. In this case, its hardly noticeable--I only realized that I didn't have difficulty following the plot back and forth AFTER I left the theatre.And the stage in which this movie is set is spectacular as well. The world is enticing with its intrigue and the many obsessive characters; I especially like the side story about Tesla and Edison, one that's only hinted at but that a short research into history of electricity will help reveal more depth to this already double-deep movie. David Bowie as Tesla was an odd choice... I hardly even noticed it was he.It's a very enjoyable movie and pretty spectacular in its own right.--PolarisDiB",9,3,5,31 October 2006
Silent Hill," Pros and Cons
","This was an interesting experience for me as it's the first time I've ever been in the position of a video game fanboy seeing a movie adaptation of something I've gotten really into. Considering the overall history of video game movie adaptations, I was worried, but considering how cinematic Silent Hill was, I figured it wouldn't be that difficult to pull off. However, when I saw the trailer and noticed that there would be a side-story involving people outside Silent Hill, I was heavily disappointed because one of the key things that makes Silent Hill the game so great is the fact that it feels utterly futile to think of any world outside of it.Well, my disappointment was misfounded, they actually did that side-story pretty well, and it didn't affect the overall grade of the movie at all. All in all, this movie exceeded my expectations for it, though it still left me craving for a little more.A big dilemma in the creation of this film is the fact that it seems almost required to hold some of those coded horror-genre elements that tend to be a turn-off to even the average film-goer: horror-film style acting (sure they can scream, but can they pronounce emotion otherwise?), some very campy dialog at points (Cop: 'They say this town is haunted.' protagonist: 'I think they're right.' Audience: 'Ughhh...'), and the decision over what would be more scary, to actually show the terrifying elements or allow the audience's imagination to go wild. Sometimes it was successful, sometimes it wasn't.I can say this about it: it could have used a bit less audio, both in terms of dialog and music. Sometimes it just felt like the music was making it less scary, and some of the expository dialog was pretty much unnecessary: most of the dialog between the male cop and the husband, or that moment when the protagonist looks at the smudge on her finger and says 'Ash...' Yeah, we know it's ash. Now on with the imagery and off with the sound! Also, Pyramidhead's appearance was glaringly gratuitous, for no other reason than the plot didn't fully develop his character and thus he was pretty much there for the Silent Hill gamer fan to say, 'All right now on with the good stuff!' It must be noted, however, that it was some very, VERY good stuff, so his appearance wasn't totally wasted.But all in all, it gets enough of the mood, enough of the setting, and enough of the imagery in that it's a pretty decent film. Enough might not be enough in that I would really like some more... *HEAVY DUTY SPOILERS HERE* For a film with skin-ripping and barbed-wire raping, it seems to be pretty needlessly reserved in other parts, like pretty much refusing to show the entire crucified janitor *YOU CAN OPEN YOUR EYES NOW*. I did hear that a lot of the film had to be cut merely to give it an R rating. Thus, for once in my life, I'm actually more interested to see the Extended and Unrated DVD that inevitably will come out.--PolarisDiB",7,2,4,1 May 2006
Once," Good music and a story makes a concept album, not a movie. Imagery makes a movie.
","This movie has been getting a lot of attention, and has even made quite a few best-of lists. In a way, it's perfectly understandable: this movie is about music, it has good music, and mostly importantly, the good music it has is about the emotional ambiance of the characters, something that can be totally felt from the music. As an inspirational art-piece, it allows the creative desire for music and the expressiveness of music to wash through the viewer.However, I'm a film critic. I admit that sometimes that means that I have quips with a movie that possibly don't deserve it. Sometimes I worry about craft and function where it doesn't matter, where the point is only to tell the story or relate a certain sensibility, which is what I gather this movie is trying to do. But let's face it, as a movie, this movie sucks. The music is wonderful, and with a few bits of the dialog thrown in it would make an interesting narrative concept album. At any rate, it's quite the audio experience. It's visual aspect, however, goes beyond 'leaving a lot to ask for'. Its cinematic-ness, the visual storytelling of it, is completely inept.Here's the thing: it's a cheap production with hand-held cameras, but that's not why it's bad: it's bad because the production never rises above its limitations. Almost 60% of this film seems to be the camera-person just trying to find a place to set the camera so that the image doesn't just sit static or eventually become boring. You know, a good cut could possibly help, but unfortunately the filmmakers are much more interested in long takes, long takes that basically involve shifting perspective for no real reason but that they suddenly realize 'oh, oops, this is a movie, better get a different angle.' Forget actually setting up a scene or telling a story visually--this movie lays its emphasis so much on the music and dialog that almost all of it doesn't have to be watched at all, only listened to.And that is what I consider to be inappropriate. A movie about music can rely on its music to make most of its statements--that's fine. A movie that relies on its music to make most of its statements, however, cannot forget that the audience is watching. We need something to look at, something to engage with. I'm not talking fast cuts or unique editing or anything particularly special. I'm talking about something that doesn't involve the cameraman walking the camera from one side of a piano to another. I'm talking about needing some level of craft or design that helps bring the audience into the music instead of making them steadily stop watching the movie and just listening to the music solely. I'm talking figuring out how to express, in imagery, the same feelings the music is supposed to be expressing.This film doesn't do that, and thus this film fails as a film. The drama and performance is there, but not captured. The beauty and emotion is told, not shown. That is why this is not a very good movie.--PolarisDiB",2,9,27,10 January 2008
The Expendables," I'm here to see action stars fight each other, not speak. Why did Stallone waste my time with plot?!
","There is a Japanese movie known as Versus. In Versus, an idiosyncratic collection of characters find their way for various reasons to a forest, in which setting they fight. After they fight, they fight again. Some of them get killed. When they get killed, they come back to life and fight again. Flashbacks show they fought in the past. A lead-out shows they will fight into the future. Versus is full of fights fights fights and more fights. It's kind of pointless but at least memorable and strange for being a purely action movie with only the merest hint of plot.That is what I thought The Expendables was going to be. It was not. Sylvester Stallone made a strangely bad decision and gave his movie plot and character development. It may be strange to say that plot and character development is a bad choice when making an action movie (many movies do this quite well), but the movie is, after all, sold as a wide collection of meatpacking action actors fighting each other... and there is actually rather little of that, ultimately. Instead most of the movie is watching Stallone and Statham quip with each other. Which would be fine if it weren't for the fact that the lines are delivered, as expected, clunkily. And then you get the fact that some actors, like Bruce Willis, Arnold Schwartzenegger, and Mickey Rourke don't even fight at all--though to be fair to Arnold, he's busy, and to be fair to Rourke's character, he does get a surprisingly amazing monologue near the end of the film.So, indeed, this movie has a plot. The Expendables are a group of mercenaries who go around the world kicking ass and taking names, and after the success of one mission are contacted by a shady Mr. Church (Willis) to go to South America and depose a dictator. Unfortunately, when they get there, they realize they've been mislead into a situation involving a CIA agent gone rogue and become drug merchant (played by Eric Roberts, certainly running the fun badguy gamut with roles like this and The Dark Knight), who has set up a proxy dictator as misdirection to his scheme. Stallone himself decides to pull out of the too-dangerous mission, but the plight of the dictator's daughter (Giselle Itie) makes him reconsider the lives he's taken and the souls he has yet to save. Meanwhile, Statham pines over his ex-girlfriend gone run off with abusive jerk, Dolph Lundgreen sells out the crew because of an often spoke of but not really shown junky addiction (one gets hints of deleted scenes tying together the drug trade and Lundgreen's character's problem), and the other actors are just kinda there.That's where the problem lies. By introducing an actual plot with character development, now the characters all have hints of stories and backgrounds that are interesting and left completely unrealized. You have Ying Yang the Jet Li character, who lies about stuff for reasons not really explained, a couple of Expendables in the back crew who have fun conversations but don't really do anything but just be there, and only a couple real one-on-one battles of any 'What would happen if this guy faced this guy?' significance (the best one being Li versus Lundgreen). Eric Roberts' crew has Steve Austin and some other guy. Literally, that is all. C'mon, the set up is easy, split the cast half and half as two 'crews' and then have the usual double-crosses to mix things up a bit! Instead we have just enough of a plot to wish it were more fully developed, and too much to fit in all of the head-on-head spectacles we came to the theatre in the first place to see; we have enough acting to see how the acting is lacking, and not enough to really test or expand the audience's appreciation for the capabilities of these names to act. You also get strange and ill-fitted morality like how 'We don't kill that way' (but apparently, killing other ways is more justifiable or something--it's worth debating if it were, you know, actually discussed).Yes. Nobody's going into this movie expecting anything brilliant. However, they are going in expecting some mad action facedowns from popular and well known action heroes of yesteryear, and the movie is relatively lacking on this point because the movie wastes time doing something that nobody expects will be particularly brilliant.Or, to put it shortly, instead of watching Jason Statham fight a variety of other action stars to settle those 'What would happen if Jason Statham fought _____' bets, we're actually supposed to sit through him trying to make us believe he's feeling sad about a breakup.At least it showcases Mickey Rourkes' mad thespian skills. And the action scenes that do occur are quite actiony and action filled, with lots of action, as it should be.--PolarisDiB",5,2,7,17 September 2010
Pan's Labyrinth," Great story with some minor poor decisions.
","Warning: this review is a discussion fraught with spoilers. Please don't read it if you don't want key elements of the plot given away to you.Guillermo del Toro has brought us another story along the archetypal 'lonely bookworm uses fantasy to escape horrors of reality' arch, but has brought it to a stunning new level. Within is the typical orphaned life, evil stepmother (stepfather...), and classic fantasy images such as fauns and fairies, but set in fascist Spain, it is also an extreme example of the power of hope within horrendous evil.It's a beautiful and stunning movie for the most part. The characters are mostly engaging and I love the detail in the character animation. Some of the violence is very harrowing, especially in a movie about a subject most people associate with children's entertainment, and the movie is rather effective in many ways at taking one's breath away.I have a couple problems with it, though, mostly as it pertains to some of the decisions made by the characters. First of all...1) When in a fantasy/fairytale situation where someone tells you not to eat the food... don't eat the food. As in, when a creepy faceless monster guy is sitting at the table and you haven't seen the food prepared, DON'T EAT THE FOOD. There was really no reason for her to either. Del Toro could have had the same action sequence when she opens the wrong door instead, and that would have put greater impact with her decision at the end to disobey anyway. What would have made a much stronger impact, I think, would be if she opened the wrong door, retrieved that knife, the monster awoke, she barely escapes, and the the Faun gets upset with her because she didn't listen to the fairies, making her decision at the end to protect her brother an even more important thing. Instead, for really no reason shown within the film at all, she has to eat the food. NO REASON. She's familiar with fairy tales, she should know better. I know it's her imagination we're dealing with here, but she should still know better.2) When in a violent situation where you've just stabbed someone evil and need to escape, kill him! She already showed her lack of hesitation in hurting him, she had complete control over the situation, and she needed to get rid of him in order to have more time to escape before being found out. Instead she gives some weak warning about the little girl and nearly gets captured anyway. Stupid stupid stupid. And no, she did NOT know his warning to kill the little girl if anything happened, so she couldn't act upon that knowledge.3) Why is the little girl's mother attracted to this guy in the first place? That was never answered satisfactorily to me.Other than those (some may call them) nitpicks, this movie was great. I for one wouldn't mind owning it when it comes out on DVD, and I'd still recommend people go to see it.--PolarisDiB",7,2,5,24 January 2007
Knocked Up," Fairly straightforward and well-crafted situation comedy.
","Yeah, I can see what other people are saying. Judd Apatow definitely does have a sense for honest-to-life dialog, especially where his male characters are concerned. 'Knocked Up' is a generally funny, worthy two hour film about a common mistake and how it manages to bring two people together despite their differences.Seth Rogan and Katherine Heigl both do their jobs admirably, and for once a comedy of this type actually has supporting acts relatively worth something. This is a very open type of comedy, there's a little bit of humor for a lot of different dispositions. Never does the druggy humor or the whole point of Rogan as unattractive slob ever degenerate to simple stupid 'Mook' humor, and never do their worries fall into simple hysterics--the obvious approaches to this film. Instead, it's a much more natural, straightforward form of situation comedy that is relatable to a huge demographic of people.Now the question remains, is this a film with any lasting power? As it were, the movie itself is a finely crafted piece of work that is also so quiet and honest that it might not really stick out in people's memories at all. 'Knocked Up' is definitely an at-the-moment type of movie, indicated by such things as its contemporary technology humor ('I Google'd 'murder'') and the whole Internet-start-up subplot ('Like Mr. Skin?' was what I was thinking too). I ended up paying 9 bucks to see it... it was probably worth more around 6.--PolarisDiB",7,1,4,25 June 2007

'Mmmm, meat pies! I'd like some meat pies, would you like some meat pies?' Have good meat pie conversations with your neighbors (esp. if they haven't seen the film before). This can be especially fun during the song 'A Little Priest'.6) Try to memorize the lyrics and sing along, but even without having seen it before, EVERYONE should chorus to, 'I'll steal you, Joanna!' 7) Have fun and make up responses as you go along.8) YES, it IS just as good/bad as Rocky Horror Picture Show, so let's get some activity going! --PolarisDiB",7,0,3,9 January 2008
Horrible Bosses," Funnier than expected
","The first question going in the theatre is how these guys are going to justify killing their bosses to themselves and us in a way that doesn't feel like too much of a device. Just as how in Office Space their revenge has to be turned on them to prevent any viewers from getting the wrong idea, this movie had to really win us over on their intentions while also holding back from leading people to the wrong moral conclusions. So it did so by making the bosses incredibly sadistic.Which is great! The three main characters as television-trained comedy leads works for a sort of small-screen charm and episodic shortsightedness while the three bigger star actors as the bosses get to be Big Personalities. It's surprising how little of the gags in the movie end up being too gimmicky--even the 'wet worker' scene, the most disposable in the movie, ends up showcasing just how inept these guys are and justifies their decision that leads them to the character named Mother****er Jones (mrp mrp IMDb guidelines). Even that groan-worthy joke works, partly because of a buildup behind M. Jones' explanation if his name but also because this is just how out-of-their-league the leads are. Also, Jamie Foxx embraces that character and makes it shine. Everyone seemed to relish their roles. No one the less than Jennifer Aniston, who seems transformed here....but nowhere near as much as Colin Ferrell, which if the credits hadn't told me, I would have never noticed it was him.So anyway, the basic plot is this: three guys got three bosses that they decide to kill off. One boss is an unabashed egomaniac willing to tell you to your face that he'll eat you alive (Kevin Spacey, deliciously evil); another is a nymphomaniacal dentist (Jennifer Aniston) who sexually molests her assistant (Charlie Day) by blackmailing him against his fiancée; and the third is a raging coke addict (Colin Ferrell). From here, however, the movie plays it smart and focuses more on the leads (Day, Jason Bateman, and Jason Sudeikis) as they figure out how to pull off their intent. The smart move the movie takes is to show they can't even figure out how to figure out their intent. Things spiral out of control and it becomes a race for the characters just to catch up with themselves. These guys are so effectively clueless that it takes a deft series of mistakes and misunderstandings just to get them to the point where they can even ask themselves if they are capable of taking a human life. And of course by then things have happened beyond their ability to go back, really justifying the movie's brisk playlength. You'll be amazed how quickly time flies while watching this movie.There certainly is a bit of a disappointment that the movie did not really go into questioning and reminiscing on its concept a little more. This movie under the hands of someone like the Coen brothers would have made an amazingly dry classic. However, it is under the capable hands of Seth Gordon, whose King of Kong: a Fistful of Quarters shows an almost equally sadistic ego/underdog id relationship. Perhaps in a sense the characters ARE too big to be fully believable and there's something more serious to go with here, but what this movie does have works well for it, and its closing sequence is a perfect closing note to the rest of the movie.Now my qualms. Of all the boss/employee relationships shown here, the one between Jennifer Aniston and Charlie Day has a lot of room for criticism. This is a situation where if the genders were reversed, people would NOT find this movie funny... and my feelings about that are a little mixed. Is it wrong that we find this funny, or is it wrong that we wouldn't if the genders were reversed? However, there are two other reasons to criticize its inclusion. One is that whereas all the story elements ultimately work themselves out satisfactorily, nevertheless nympho-chick sort of gets forgotten as the two other bosses take over the movie for a bit. The unbalanced structure works because the movie ties up all its loose ends, but there is the fact that this part of the story is predicated on Day not wanting to lose his girlfriend. So, riddle me this, why couldn't he have said to his fiancée before psycho-lady drops the payload that she was trying to blackmail him? The question is tossed off with, 'Oh well nobody will believe you because you're a sex criminal', but if we're to believe that this marriage he hopes so much for is supposed to have any basis for survival, we have to also believe duder has a spine and the trust of his lady. The spine is character development--the trust... absent. Nothing can convince me that Day's character could not have found at least some way of telling his fiancée what he told his friends, how he told them, and earn her trust--especially since he is clear whenever he tells everyone else about it that this is real victimhood.So in that storyline is a wide variety of issues that may end up pulling this movie down from a deserved cult status. To be fair, it does point out things that need to be acknowledged, like the dismissiveness of most people towards the concept of female-to-male molestation and our tendency to automatically villify sex criminals without ensuring we know the actual crime. It's a storyline that I feel only falls apart because there's not enough of the relationship shown to believe in it, but it's open to being torn down depending on the reception of the audience. Nevertheless I found the movie hilarious and witty, well written despite three writers and with surprising and welcome twists, with a satisfying payoff.--PolarisDiB",8,1,2,14 August 2011
Elf," Maintains its gift of charm.
","I actually was not all that remiss to seeing this, Jon Favreau is one of my favorite filmmakers working in Hollywood today. Zathura is Where the Wild Things Are without the cerebralness or Karen O, I am of the camp that considers Iron Man and its sequel to be both living up to and counterbalancing Nolan's machismo brooding tale of The Dark Knight, Cowboys vs. Aliens promises to be geeky fanboy action in CGI awesomeness about in a blender with some actual plot and characters.I find Will Ferrell insufferable when he yells.Will Ferrell is like Jim Carrey. People like him mugging, mocking, yelling, contorting his face, and generally just being a big child, when homeboy could actually continue to keep making awesome stuff like Stranger than Fiction (or in Carrey's case, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind). For whatever reason, actually having a character is animus to an audience that just wants a clown banging his head against a wall. I'm sorry, Will Ferrell. You deserve better than that.So anyway, this movie is a modern classic for the Yuletide Time and for what it's worth, I can definitely see why. Buddy's absolute belief in Christmas cheer and his grinning dedication to spreading it is infectious, in its own way. It helps that the cynicism of the other characters actually works out sensibly. The movie still has to have its regrettable prolonged burp jokes, but it's nice to see things like random-taxi-hits-lead turn into actual character development as Buddy progressively gets a handle of this strange New York reality world he's found himself in and starts to adapt to its landscape... but all without losing his spiritedness. I can get behind that.Could be better. It did feel like just a few scenes were missing in the love subplot between Buddy and Jovie (Zooey Deschanel).What won me over in this movie was the North Pole land and the CGI references to old stop-motion animation Christmas movies of the past. Leon the Snowman is where it's at. Also, not only is Peter Dinklage an underrated actor, but his work in this movie shows he could do some really remarkable stuff if we'd all get over the 'But it's funny 'cause he's a little person' aspect of it. Compare his role here (oh so woefully, woefully short, oh so scene-stealing) to his work in The Station Agent and then his work in Death at a Funeral (the, uh, British one, not the redundant and confusingly way too soon after remade one) and this man has a gift.So what the hey, seal of approval for this one. Going back to Favreau, I can't emphasize enough he knows how to keep a movie moving and never outstays his welcome, Elf moves at a brisk pace and is over before you know it, whether you like it or not. Now that audiences are actually getting comfortable watching giant robot movies for two and a half hours or more, the art of moving along, one of Hollywood's major entertainment assets, sometimes feels like it's getting lost.--PolarisDiB",6,2,2,11 August 2011
Capote," The life of some minds...
","Two very engaging and very compelling things are centerpieces for works that people keep coming back to again and again: psychopaths and artists. Especially when both are slightly insane or egotistic, the analysis of brains abnormal and uncomprehended are fascinating and wondrous motifs that re-occur in literature and media again and again.This movie has both, a very contradictory and egotistic mind, Truman Capote's, matched with the alarmingly sweet and charismatic mind of a psychopath, Perry Smith, who Truman falls in love with and interviews for research to write his best-selling and important work, In Cold Blood.The result is very affecting. Hoffman's zealous and defined portrayal of Capote is matched by the outstanding performance of Clifton Collin's Jr., the lonely and slightly terrifying face of a killer who is human and humanized.The real drama comes from Capote's terrifyingly manipulative mind. For someone who didn't know much about Capote before I entered the theatre, Hoffman's performance was simply shocking. The commercials and advertising and posters and the like would have you imagine that Capote was a very strong artistic trope, like other biopics that show brilliant artists and their troubles. However, a couple of things should be noted... first, this is not a biopic. Second, Capote's flamboyantly homosexual and confrontationally controversial mannerisms both set the man himself apart from the type of character we like to see from artists, and also set Hoffman's performance apart from basically anything we've ever seen before.A side-result is a very discomforting and contradictory look. Capote lies, manipulates, cheats... and yet the presentation of these events help us concern ourselves with his character so much that we can't help but want every part of his innermost desires to actualize. We have a man who kills, but he's also lonely and afraid and willing to cling on to anybody who will give him attention. We empathize with characters we'd normally shun, yet simultaneously feel uncomfortable being so close to them, thus wanting to know more about them so that we can come to terms with who they are.And at the end, when we see the denouement of what is both a perverse and a relatable relationship, the movie centers in on Smith's heavy breathing as he awaits his doom and the audience breaths heavily along with him, feeling all hope begin to fade from the screen as the deranged Capote watches on. Now tell me that isn't great, great film-making.--PolarisDiB",10,0,0,20 February 2006
Corpse Bride," Not deathly, but not lively
","Well, this is no Nightmare before Christmas, but taken as its own work, it's a decently told fairy tale of a man torn between his living, breathing love-of-his-life, and the woman he accidentally marries, who despite being a charming and romantic individual unto herself is, well, dead. He has to choose between these two tender, caring women, without breaking either of their hearts--even if one of their hearts isn't beating. He has to live up to the obligations and promises he makes, no matter how clumsily, 'til death do they part--even if they're already dead. Yeah, yeah, I can come up with them all day, and really that's the basic gist of 90% of the humor in this thing.It looks pretty, though the 'Downstairs' neon lighting is a change from expectations. There are some really stunning moments of animation in here, but some of it is really flat, especially in the non-lead character design (is that a scrotum on her head?). I actually really like the lead characters for the most part, Johnny Depp's voice work is better than expected, but the movie doesn't get going until the 'She's a corpse bride!' song and a lot of the minor characters seem to merely stretch out screen-time. Plus, the evil Lord Barkis is... well, not really all that stand-out-ish, as characters are concerned. He feels almost obligatory.Fans of movies Burton's a fan of will get excited by those little asides (Victor and Victoria, really?), and fans of Burton get exactly what they want from him. This movie isn't bad but it's certainly not great, and for some reasons seems to miss some of the magical excitement of a lot of Burton's other works, animated and live-action--much like, unfortunately, a good part of his later career, which seems to spare no expense of the visuals but only seems half-hearted in the execution.--PolarisDiB",6,0,1,11 September 2009
Gone Baby Gone," It was almost there...
","The first two-thirds of this movie is honestly great. Ben Affleck presents a new level of dark and grit in a story about an abducted child, the private investigators hired to find her, and the local Boston community--a much more ugly background of extras typically used in even the most 'social realist' of film works, where the grim of the street is more effectively incorporated into the scarred visages of people without make-up effects. It's a compelling and dark look at a reality where children go missing all the time, where the media has a field-day with the attention while real families are brought into conflict and even the emotional demands of cops are not fully brought into closure.And then Affleck drops the ball, majorly. At somewhere around the 2/3rds point (give or take a percentage of the play time), suddenly the story switches gears with another one of those unnecessary 'twists' that contemporary movies trying to increase the ante tend to throw into what was previously a well-crafted movie. At the point at which the cops are implemented into corruption and guilt for the crime is when almost all of the characters suddenly start working entirely against their motivations and all logic and realism is frankly tossed out the window. This wouldn't be such a problem if it wasn't for the fact that realism was part of the point. But mostly, we as audience are supposed to accept that the following conversation took place:Titus Welliver: 'Listen, I have this niece who I love but who unfortunately is being neglected and abused by her coke-addict mother. I would like some help in getting her away from this damaging environment.' Ed Harris: 'Okay, I know the captain of the child-abduction section of the police force is dealing with extreme issues of loss from his own child's death, so let's kidnap the girl and place the blame on the coke-dealers while he'll adopt her.'when in the really real world, where even corrupt cops like Ed Harris' character have their credibility to protect and cops like Morgan Freeman's captain would never actually agree to that crap, the conversation would have gone like this:Titus: 'Listen, I have this niece who I love but who is being neglected by her coke-addict mother, I would like to help her.' Ed Harris: 'Okay, here's the number and the names of some contacts I know in social services, while in the meantime I'll follow up on this whole coke-addiction lead and maybe get me some dealers and users in jail for some good Boston P.D. PR!'Yep. Nonsense. The point of the movie, of course, is that these decisions create a real moral issue in the main character, played by Casey Affleck, who has to decide where the ethical ground lays and whether it may not be perversely better to allow Morgan Freeman to adopt the girl, albeit highly illegally and sinisterly. Except that crisis of morality makes no real sense and has no real importance in a situation in which none of the characters actually have a logical motivation for the crime. Instead, the movie is filled with truisms, pedophilia substories, and Catholic symbolism to show just how degraded our society can come to be in a way that basically makes this movie just a really intricate and fleshed-out episode of CSI: visceral and sensationally disturbing, but utterly absurd at heart. Too bad, because it was aiming more like 'Chinatown' for a new generation.There are other more minor problems with the movie, such as the fact that Casey's character's girlfriend pretty much doesn't need to be included: at first she plays the sensible foil and emotional weight of the two-character team, but that conflict could have easily been encased in Casey's role alone, especially as that very thing happens as the character gets more and more involved and the girlfriend, similarly, starts slowly phasing out of the plot... Secondly, whereas people can be violent, there seems to a strong inflection on the fact that these characters pretty much resort to violence before most other solutions. Add a scene which pretty much stands in for an unquestioned argument for capital punishment and vigilantism, and some of the less-fleshed out consequences of the narrative become disturbingly clear.It was a good job on everyone's part, but MAN did it need a massive re-write and re-thinking, especially since it tries to sell itself as the type of movie people are supposed to mull over for weeks.--PolarisDiB",3,25,39,28 February 2008
Burn After Reading," 'Well, what have we learned?'
","There it is, the Coens have done it again. They've hit another home run by taking what seems like a pretty standard plot and gleefully playing with the audience's expectations. 'Burn after Reading' is a hilarious and almost dizzying espionage comedy movie where the true intelligence has no idea what's going on and the lesser intelligence are creating problems over practically no goals at all. Like 'The Big Lewbowski', many players factor into the story, but this time you're treated to a much more ensemble cast of characters that frankly have no idea what to do with each other.Osbourne Cox (John Malkovich) quits his job as an analyst for the CIA after he's given a short shrift that sets him off. He decides to write some memoirs to damn the institution that he feels hasn't treated him fairly, while settling into a less-than-stable home life filled with infidelity and backstabbing. Actually, for a movie featuring the CIA as a major part of the character's lives, much more sordid goings on simply involve sex and loneliness than any international hijinks. But of course that's just the point as relationship-by-relationship, Cox' memoirs and computer data end up in the hands of two bumbling gym workers (one (Francis McDormand) of which ends up in a relationship with Cox's wife's lover (George Clooney), further sealing the twisting inter-relations of this group) who of course do the stupid thing and decide to try to get money for it, causing all sorts of scandal as Russians, Americans, public servers, and private investigators all try to figure out what's going on and what's important--because who cares about the memoirs of a third level government analyst, anyway? To the Coen's repertoire of working with great actors over the years is added Tilda Swinton and Brad Pitt, both of whom, of course, do amazingly. Apparently Brad Pitt's role was written just for him after he approached the Coens about doing something with them, and really the movie gets going once Chad appears. Other familiar faces from Coen brother history appear, sometimes in cameos (this is probably the most cameo'd movie of the Coens, ultimately), and all of them seem happy to be involved once again with another great movie by the masters.But, of course, the joy of seeing good acting and great direction is overshadowed completely by the Coens return to form as they twist expectations. Much has already been made about the fact that the characters are essentially idiots and most of them don't even know what they're striving for, but even better, some of the more significant moments of the plot aren't shown while other smaller moments are lingered on, creating a beautiful branching tree of a world where sometimes the real information is simply in an aside when people are aggravating over the details. This, of course, is pulled off with panache by the Coen brothers' legendary dialog, which of course had the majority of the theatre literally rolling on the floor laughing.And like most of their movies, the humor comes mostly from a dark place of absurdity that honestly makes one shake one's head and think, 'Where do they come up with this stuff?' If anything else, this movie is so unique and original it deserves a look-see just to watch the look on a Ceon brother's newcomer's face as he or she follows the inevitable, but winding course of their morbid fascination with botched crime, paranoia, and dysfunction.--PolarisDiB",9,3,9,14 September 2008
Watchmen," Quelle surprise!
","Well I did my civic duty and went to watch the Watchmen. Gotta say, this is some good adapted cinema. Zack Snyder plays it close enough to the original comic book that only die-hard fans will nitpick, and he manages to make a movie that can be enjoyed over some three hours and counting that doesn't feel all that long while sitting in the actual theatre. Considering the last thing he did was that real stain 300, we can tell that the really significant difference between the quality of one comic book film and the other adapted by him is the source material. Watchmen is a classic, and the movie does it a fair bit of justice.I can't speak to what people who HAVEN'T read the original source material will think about it, except that there was a disturbing amount of children in the audience attending the screening. Note to parents: comic book movies don't mean friendly all American superheroes. Actually, that's the image that this movie deconstructs, and with lots of disturbing material even by today's standards. However, for the REST of the world going to see it with no expectations, it tells the story quite well and hits the major points fluently, which is refreshing, and it is well-paced and entertaining, though in some places dark. Can't wait to hear what people who haven't read the comic have to say about the ending... gotta be good.Even the acting is pretty true to the original characters, which is surprising. Seems the actors did their research and feel those characters, which is a change in form for many adaptations, I must say. If Snyder leaves a personal print on this, it's in the music. Some of his choices work... some of them are unintentionally funny. Oh well.I'm sorry I'm writing this review as a comparison to the novel, which I'm sure there is no end of all across the Internet. It's just hard, when having experienced another version first, not to compare the two materials, and Snyder sticks so closely to Moore's ideas (if maybe not his specific vision... credit removed, yet again!) that the movie almost begs cross-reference. I for one miss the primary colors of the graphic novel, but that's just me. I'm sure other fans have their own personal beef with the movie, but I think in the end it is the audience who aren't previously acquainted who will really show how effective this movie is.--PolarisDiB",8,2,6,7 March 2009
28 Weeks Later," A nice companion piece that holds the key to good sequels.
","28 weeks later, England is declared free of infection and rebuilding has begun. People are being shipped in from overseas under the protection of the United States Army to repopulate the island, and among them is young Andy and his sister Tammy, who were away on an overseas class trip while their parents were stuck in a cottage fighting off zombies. Once the kids get on the island, though, infection re-emerges (in a contrived but reasonable way) and the action is on.28 Days Later could be said to be about a man who built himself a family and, when his family was attacked, defended it. 28 Weeks Later is sort of a mirror-reversal diptych of that concept, instead showing two children survive a dysfunctional and fragile family, but ultimately spreading their discontent into the future. 28 Weeks Later can't match up to Days' cinematography and mood, but the music far surpasses the original, and it holds true to the way the first film showed what people like that would do in a situation like that. In fact, 28 Weeks Later was very daring in being direct in how the characters in it deal with their respective situations, especially when it involves the military, considering how popular anti-militantism is right now.However, the movie serves up a big enough serving of contrivances to make it, unfortunately, that lesser sequel that we expect. No, 28 Weeks Later is nowhere near as good as the original. But it's still a decent film, and even though it has an annoying tendency to provide easy exits for characters in awkward contexts, it also has such moments as the helicopter-blade-meets-zombie-horde scene, the beauty of which will bring tears of happiness to the eyes and eternal love to the hearts of every zombie-movie fan in the world.So sit back and enjoy this next serving, and hope along with me that the bad cliffhanger ending will at least lead to some more movies that hold to the values of cinematography, post-rock music, and familial survivalism nature of the previous films.--PolarisDiB",7,0,3,14 May 2007
21," Pretty, and average, so pretty average
","What can I say, I like a good story that combines math talent with risk and danger. Not quite a heist movie, and of course 'loosely' based on a true story, 21 is some pretty good popcorn fare for a good two hours and change.The images are pretty. They are mostly clichéd and typical shots of Las Vegas, the usual glam and color on winding aerials and dissolves, but it's fun to look at. The characters are entertaining. For some reason, Kevin Spacey went to sleep for this role, which is interesting because if he had actually bothered to put some work into it, it might have made this a much more fun movie, and his character would be much more dynamic. Instead, he barely keeps his eyes open. It's strange. The story is predictable, but the details suffice to keep you interested.All in all, it's a very average movie. Sometimes movies are so average, that it's worth emphasizing the absolute average-ness of it. This is one of those movies. There's really nothing else to say.--PolarisDiB",5,2,2,19 June 2009
The Orphanage," Are we returning to good old fashioned horror stories finally?
","This movie has already been compared to way too many classic and well-known contemporary horror films. That's because it's a classic story. A woman moves into the haunted house of her memories, discovers ghosts and a mystery, starts working it all out while a cynical husband states that it can't be real, and eventually resolves the pained past of what causes the haunting in the first place, thus leading to transcendence. There are creepy children, bumps in the night, and an old woman with shady motivations. It literally couldn't go wrong.And it doesn't. J.A. Bayona gets the help of famed Pan's Labyrinth director Guillermo del Toro to float, move, and explore his way through dusty rooms, hidden basements, and creepy hallways. Belen Rueda plays a caring, compassionate mother who only wants to protect her son, though she makes mistakes that sometimes a mother makes. Creepy ghost children play hide-and-seek and treasure-hunt games, ultimately leading to a compelling twist. This movie is carefully designed and even holds a few surprises.Whereas it may not be the most original movie out there, it certainly has its place for an audience craving a good old fashioned horror movie themed around something other than idiots trapped in a room full of intricate torture devices. It's a very nice return to form, and it's probably something you should see before the grubby Hollywood execs put their dirty paws on it and turn it into a CUTITSACAT! glurge-o-mania.--PolarisDiB",7,4,7,23 January 2008
Wanted," Dragging and undramatic stylistic action sequences
","I was able to catch this movie for free, and thank God I didn't spend money on this. Basically, the director from Night Watch slows it down a bit (just a bit) and makes a cheesy, bland action flick about a guy who joins the Fraternity, a secret group of assassins. Now, me, I have a special place in my heart for assassins, rogues, cat burglers, snipers, and sneaky marginalized heroes of all types, so I understand that it's really a matter of taste when I say I didn't care much for the type of 'world-saving' assassin that flips cars and blows up trains shown in this film. On the other hand, I don't think it's a matter of taste when I say that it's stupid to watch a movie where a guy walking across the street gets the same stylistic cutting and zoom-sound editing as a guy trying to pick off a target from a moving train. Night Watch was frustrating because its most beautiful images (and thus, basically, the reason to watch the film) were cut away merely for stylistic effect; Wanted at least has some images that you can linger on and enjoy, but they ultimately begin to drag under poor stylistic direction and, of course, a pretty ridiculous storyline.Another thing is the concept behind the curving bullets. Me, I can accept such an idea in a movie of this type because it's not so much trying to be real as it's trying to provide a neat new approach to action and the movie does at least bother to explain it (somewhat), which is nice. But what with all the other things that happen in this movie, one discovers that what those characters are using are not guns. Guns don't shoot out knives that got jammed up their barrel, they backfire. Guns don't bend barrels around corners and then have the bullet follow the path of the barrel, they backfire. Guns can't be held like a friggin' baseball, they have this thing known as 'kick-back'. There's only so far things like that can go before what you're watching is not a gun battle, but honestly just a really boring exposition of some guy magically making all of his opponents die without a scratch. And that's not exciting, tense, or really much of anything, because there's no drama in it. I mean, really, all the jump-cuts in the world don't replace the need for some logical foil in plot to give our intrepid hero something to strive against. (And besides, in a world where people believe The Da Vinci Code is real, 10000 BC is an historical exploration into our past, and the selective trivia of National Treasure has any true referent in our nation's history, I can't help but wonder how many stupid people are actually going to try this curving bullet thing.) Ultimately, there's a lot of really good movies out there right now, and it's hard for me to imagine why anyone would really want to go see this one instead. Oh wait: it does have a shot of Angelina Jolie's butt. And for better or for worse, Morgan Freeman is always an interesting actor. Oh, and, well, all of the office scenes work for a sort of follow-up to Office Space style humour and catharsis. But, basically, all of that exposition is in about the first half of the movie, so once the unearned 'twist' in the plot occurs about two-thirds in, you'll pretty much know all of the plot you need to know and seen all of the images you need to see, and you can leave there.--PolarisDiB",4,6,17,1 July 2008
Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa," Moot point
","In a way, audiences can take comfort in the fact that pretty much at any given point in the movie, what's happening on the screen has little to do with what happened before or what's going to happen after it. Sure, Madagascar 2 has a plot, but said plot is boiled down to its bare essentials (Lion-guy returns to Africa to find out that he's the son of a king, must prove himself to his old pride, succeeds, the end) and is more of a bookmark for the various jokes and zaniness on display.Okay, so let me start over: the only reason anyone is watching this movie is for the penguins.Chris Rock as a zebra makes 'Zebras all look alike' jokes. Ben Stiller as the lion has a birthmark in the shape of Africa and Madagascar on his paw. The hippo is fat and the hypochondriac giraffe is in love with her. That's pretty much as subtle as it gets. Which is fine, because it really comes across as some quick, cheap escapism.The penguins, however, are funny. They banter and pun and, well, actually do stuff. Heck, Sacha Baron Cohen as the lemur king had his moments, too. It's pretty sad when the movie is stolen from all of the main characters by the characters they hardly interact with. In fact, I'd like to note that the penguins have their own shorts... two of them, in fact. So, uh, buh, duh, er... why not just make Madagascar 3 featuring, entirely, the penguins? Cut out all that other nonsense. It'd be a much better movie. (This problem is not peculiar to this specific movie. Ice Age 4 should be an epic, two-hour long Scrat fest. Nobody cares about the woolly mammoth and any of his friends already!) And as for that other little lemur chased by the shark, he pretty much set the movie overboard from mindless escapism to vacuous. This movie needed some paring down of in-jokes and more engagement with what the audience actually seems to want, judging by what actually got the laughs in the theatre I was attending.--PolarisDiB",3,3,8,4 February 2009
The Battle of Algiers," Classic and Document
","This is one of those movies that has not only become a classic of world cinema, but has become a historical document and technical discourse in its own right. While audiences around the globe cringe at its tragic narrative, military personnel watch it in order to understand the nature of urban-based guerilla warfare. Either way, the end result is the same: Empire is a Sisyphean business.The movie begins on a raid and then quickly dissolves into the story leading up to the raid. Ali La Pointe is one of the highest leaders in the resistance of French control in Algiers, a resistance structured by a hierarchy of anonymity so that no one tier of it can lead directly to the rest. The occupiers are forced to use arrest and torture in order to ferret out every member, and only through the most extreme activities are successful. Their success, however, hardly wins the overall war. In the end, nobody wins.Gillo Ponticorvo's approach is somewhere between that of Rome, Open City and Salvatore Guiliano. In theory, he's using realistic and documentary modes of expression, and yet those very grainy frames he creates is in its own way a darkly Romantic view of society degrading. His best approach to realism is in the use of non-professional actors, who all are remarkable.Hopefully no one stops paying attention. Sure, anybody can find parallels between what happens in this movie and what's happening today, but more importantly it's important to keep in mind how the movie documents a process over a specific time, and how that process can re-arise again and again and again. History repeats itself, so it is important to always remain aware.--PolarisDiB",10,0,1,6 April 2009
Ratatouille," More scrumptious than eye-candy
","Okay, first things first: scratch ANYTHING you've read in any review, private, published, online, or otherwise, that worries that children might not be that interested in this movie; the presentation I went to was filled with people of all ages, and they all sat right through the end credits. I'm getting really offended by reviewers' habits of passing off successful character development as something children wouldn't be interested in, as if children don't have the basic cogent powers to understand stories, but even if that were the case, this film is remarkably kinetic and exciting--it even is a little slapstick.But that's just the spice. The meat of the matter is that Pixar has followed up their still-good-but-somewhat-formulaic Cars with something really special, a pretty original movie about a rat named Remy who wants to be a cook and all of the things that get in the way--not just a world disgusted by rats, but a personal life that doesn't support his dream. In positive Pixar land, that means Remy will have to make new friends and discover the value in himself before he's able to ultimately work it all out, but believe me, it's all enjoyable and fun in the process.I've written a few and read a million reviews on various Pixar films, and there's just no way around mentioning the animation. Though computer animation has vastly improved over a very short time and other companies are beginning to reach Pixar's level, Pixar's animation is still distinct and original, and a great mainstream marker with which to base any other animated endeavor. In this case, the motion and energy seems to fill the frame as much deep and far as it does close and personal, and the team has built a world of details. Every Pixar feature seems to be an improvement on the last, and at this point the production company is getting uncannily... real...But what I think I like the most about Ratatouille is the use of Anton Ego, the bleak food critic who presents one of many major challenges of Remy's culinary skills. I can't help but read this as Pixar's comment on criticism itself, and the twist is that when something like this work is made right, it not only pleases the adult sensibilities but gets into the true heart of what entertainment like this is meant for: the child inside. The moment of Anton's food taste is a perfect moment of epiphany, handled well by every trick these master craftsmen know.Ratatouille pleases, and also leaves enough to tidy us over until next year's Wall-E. It's hard to imagine it getting any better, but these guys are strangely good at that.--PolarisDiB",10,4,7,17 July 2007
No Strings Attached," Unsupported
","Do you consider A Lot Like Love and Guess Who to be classics of rom-com cinema? We're in Ashton Kutcher as lead-man territory. The romantic sensibilities are the same in all of these movies, Kutcher's goofy exterior and sensible interior somehow hits a perfect note of completely dull. He's at his best when put into awkward situations that he tries to slip his way out of, but there is not a whole lot of that here.Right then. So the story is about how nobody can be friends with benefits, and comedy ensues. Except these two are jealous coy lovers nearly from frame one (the first fifteen minutes or so goes through their back history of meeting in which even just seeing each other with potential relationships makes both of them look sad panda) and so what it's really about is Portman's character Emma trying to get over a crippling and aggressive fear of commitment. The territory in which to explore this is vast, and the scenes that actually do all work just fine. For some reason I have no real comprehension of, the movie engineers as many ways as possible of refusing to acknowledge its own core dramatic element. Probably the most egregious deviation is this completely random rival for Emma's affections, whose presence is so insignificant to the plot that you're practically editing him onto the cutting room floor in your own brain while you're watching him do his Snidely Whiplash thing. Homeboy's around for maybe three scenes and not a one of them is believable, the absolute worst being when he challenges Adam and says that Emma will be all over him after leaving Adam, without enough provocation and any true indication of Emma's interest. This whole folderol set up was meant to put a jealousy element into the movie that was already there and not in need of elaboration from a completely unbelievable and unnecessary side villain, who gets dropped the second the camera looks away and only returned back later to be literally left hanging, looking around, wondering what the heck to do and why he's in this movie.Then there's the subplot about Adam's relationship to his father which works to move forward some important plot points, but manages to do nothing to develop Adam's character. The father is there to provide a couple reasons for getting closer to Emma so that their relationship doesn't stay static, but eventually the father gets regulated to 'Well if you love her fight for her' territory. Seriously this movie spent more time ignoring its own actual premise than working through it.Also, this couple actually wants each other forever from nearly every frame after the long expository flashbacks, so most of the movie is a matter of waiting around for Emma to come around. This could be frustrating but to be fair, so is being in that situation. To be realistic, the Emmas of our lives tend not to come around, and so this movie ultimately ends up playing off like the protracted pre-sleep wish fulfillment fantasy of the recent relationship reject trying to convince himself, 'She'll come around eventually.... she'll come around eventually.... she'll come around eventually...' This is one of those movies that had just enough elements that it could have become about a million other interestingly realized movies, but the actual movie it resulted in is hardly worth saving. There's even one of those rom-com final lines before the relationship is consummated that was engineered for some nonexistent much better other movie to become a classic of heart-thumping cinema, but was unfortunately left in this movie instead.--PolarisDiB",4,1,2,14 August 2011
Tropic Thunder," Vulgar and profound
","Hilarious! Most of the big points are pretty well spoiled by the discussions that have already gone around word of mouth and mediated, the whole 'Half-retard' thing and Robert Downey Jr. in blackface (both profound and vulgar at the same time), plus respect given out to Tom Cruise (he did well), but yeah, good times all around. My particular favorites were the small asides, such as the take-offs of such things as celebrities adopting third-world orphans and having to work with the crew (as someone who has now managed to find his way onto a few sets, can I just say that I've met these people? Even on the tiniest of sets, you will find the special effects guy from this movie there. And he talks EXACTLY LIKE THAT).Ben Stiller has, in fact, made an awesome satire of Hollywood and its ways. I expected it to be fun but I didn't expect it to be THAT good... but it was particularly biting and profound.Oh, and though everyone did a good job, Downey Jr. stole the show, here. I was absolutely mesmerized by his performance... especially once he gained the Australian accent. Hot damn that guy can act.And, once again, a lot of the things that people were offended about were purposefully made fun of as offensive within the movie itself. Somehow I still manage to be surprised when people criticize something without actually making sure it actually states what they mean. Yes, all of those big topics that are offensive in this movie are very clearly stated to be ridiculous and offensive by the point of the satire itself, save of course its treatment of Hollywood, who can take it because this is still a product.--PolarisDiB",8,1,2,26 October 2008
The Dirty Dozen," A dirty, grungy film.
","WW2 classics tend to have the unfair connotation as being those movies your grandfather likes because they reflect conservative patriotism and Americans defeating evil Krauts and Japs with flashing grins and gusto. The Dirty Dozen is not that movie. Instead of beaming, all American youth, the cast is filled with slightly menacing, slouching actors portraying counter-cultural antiheroes the witch tit's side of likable. Instead of glorifying the ranks and institutions of the military, the film delights in criticizing and tearing down its structure. And instead of an awarding cathartic defeat of the Germans, the viewer is treated to disturbing and morally ambiguous ending.It's definitely a film of the 60s, but weirdly one that you wouldn't expect would be as appreciated and recognized as others. Its counterculture and anti-institutional approach is not set as a rallying cry for individualism or anti-war protest, but instead is subjected to leering and sometimes frightening characters like Franko and Maggot (get it? A Spanish fascist and a putrefaction growth as a violent bully and a disturbed racist and sexist Southerner, respectively?). The movie doesn't have an anti-war message but certainly does not make war seem sensible or dignified. The Americans certainly aren't the good guys but neither are the main characters. Pretty much all the viewer has going for him in terms of relateability or enjoyment is Lee Marvin's curmudgeony major. Everything else in this movie stinks to high heaven--but at least that's intentional.It's certainly an interesting viewing experience, I'll give it that, and I'd like to know more about its reception at the time. Apparently Roger Ebert hated it and military men loved it. Makes sense to me.--PolarisDiB",6,2,4,7 February 2009
The Butterfly Effect," Pretty good, a bit extreme
","After being recommended this movie on three different Internet recommendation engines, being told to see it by a good friend, and having half a dozen other people mention it, I figured I had to get around to seeing it. This is generally not a good way to go about seeing a movie because either one's hopes are too high or one wants to dislike it just so that everyone can stop talking about it.But I liked it. It's a pretty tight psychological thriller, involving a pretty typical storyline about alterations to the past causing the future to to turn out in 'unexpected ways'... rarely ever the way the protagonist really wants it to be. 'I'll make everything perfect!' he decrees.Ashton Kutcher is an interesting actor. I think he's a lot like Keira Knightley: both of them CAN act, it's just that if the director doesn't tell them to they won't. However, this movie shows Kutcher's one-up to Knightley in that he actually did act in this one, and Knightley has yet to fully embrace a role (but I haven't seen all of her movies, so who knows on that part).Anyway, I think the biggest thing that prevented me from giving this movie a higher score is the way the children are presented. I know that children can be damaged, and can do extreme and horrific things, but oftentimes I have a hard time accepting a movie where they find each other and end up the whole group of them hurting each other. It's hard to explain, but it's the same reason why I don't really accept a lot of the contemporary cop dramas... there seems a need in those to get some mentally damaged woman with a completely differently mentally damaged man, and then work out this intricate plot involving how their mental problems cause this huge crime but also hide it in layers of mental instability. Same thing here, I find it pretty difficult to accept four kids from three different families all with their completely separate lives coming together to create specific incident which one just happens to be able to twist around. More than making the story unbelievable, it's a matter of making it seem as if everybody out there is some insane psychopath ready to explode in the right situation... when actually psychopaths are generally kind of rare.--PolarisDiB",7,1,4,28 June 2006
No Country for Old Men," A fresh, and somewhat experimental, comeback
","Alright, so here's the deal: The Coens often work with plots involving bungled crimes that are the inevitable conclusion of many different and sometimes perverse personalities' decision making processes. This time the crime happens before the plot occurs, and the story is slightly post-apocalyptic: what has happened has already happened and its up to the characters that manage to survive to pick up the pieces. It's dark (everyone in the movie either dies or gives up), and it's also really good.This movie I compare to being slowly pressed in the gut with a knife until it ends, at which point you realize you've just been hit by a train you didn't see coming. This approach is uncanny and uncomfortable, and the Coens also risk a lot by leaving many real plot elements up in the air and letting the audience figure stuff out for themselves. This approach, though it's been done many times before, has a fresh use in their movie, but it's still risky because to this day audiences still have problems with it. Lucky for the Coens, they're well used to film-making and have the skill and narrative powers necessary to make it work despite (or perhaps literally in spite of) audience expectations.This movie is also somewhat philosophical, but I haven't yet really seen that as part of a comment that the Coens are making, but merely a transliteration of McCarthy's book. Apparently the filmmakers stuck very close to the story and dialog of the book, and no matter my tendency to prefer to read texts as singular and separate, my familiarity with the Coen brothers tells me that they took up the adaptation much more as a matter of telling the story and making the characters than keeping with the message of Ed Tom Bell's ruminations. In fact, they use his speech at the beginning and end to lend more understanding to the decisions made than the development of a fate vs. free will theme (one that I think is getting a lot of attention, which may in fact become derogatory to people's enjoyment of this film as it is). To me, it's more important that Javier Bardem's character both bleeds evil and is also pitiable and careworn than that Tommy Lee Jones says Smart Things (tm).I do think, however, that this is the best film that's been released so far this year, and a great return of the Coen brothers from their slump of the past two films (the worst of which can be said that they were merely pretty good instead of utterly fantastic).--PolarisDiB",10,4,11,19 November 2007
The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford," Fatal Gravitation
","Less the title doesn't make it clear, the voice over narration explicitly states the direction this movie is turning from frame one, so here is a movie nigh impossible to discuss in terms of spoilers. Nevertheless, the awareness of the direction the movie is going is, sincerely, the movie's greatest gift. Using Roger Deakon's amazing cinematography, Nick Cave and Warren Ellis' gorgeous music, and the acting talents of Brad Pitt and Casey Affleck, director Dominick makes his mark with a singularly meditative film that pulls the audience along like gravity at ground zero--possibly not noticed, maybe even taken for granted, but a sure and constant force.For me, the thing I liked about it the most was Jesse James' death AS the process of the whole movie; Brad Pitt blankly, almost fatalistically, gets on the chair like a man at the hanging, and this surreal sense of acknowledgement is foreshadowed in the the structure of the movie as the narrator starts it out with an obituary and Robert Ford blesses Jesse for his birthday: within five minutes the movie itself sets the length of Jesse's life. He knows when his time is up as assuredly as the audience, and we all participate.Which is why the idea of Ford as 'The Coward Robert Ford' is so interesting. This movie could almost be called 'Sympathy for Robert Ford', except that as Frank James says so early on in the movie, there's something not quite right about him. Contrasting Jesse James and Robert Ford as described in this movie, both of them are nearly sociopathic--except James because he lacks shame and remorse, and Ford because he suffers from an abundance of it. Whereas the world is populated by so many Western genre types, Robert and Jesse as portrayed by Affleck and Pitt stand out for a singular awareness of what their characters mean--but this is not a bad performance choice, it is an uncanny clairvoyance within the characters that makes this movie tug the suspense along when the ending is already known and the scenes slowly unfold at a contemplative pace.The only thing I didn't like about it was it suffered malignantly from Too Many Endings Syndrome, a particular affliction of many a contemporary director. The movie should have faded out on the famous still of James and the rest of the information given in an intertitle, if at all. I do not honestly believe Ford's confession, two song and dance routines, and another assassination really did anything the movie had not fully explored and expressed by the time the aforementioned still was shown on-screen. I also think that in almost sympathizing with Ford, the ending removes some of the ambiguity that truly makes the character more heroic and interesting, which is what the narrator tries to do.I did not know about the four hour cut until after I saw the movie, and by all means I would be very interested in seeing it, though I really hope (and am probably not far off) that most of that material is before, not after, the assassination proper.--PolarisDiB",9,0,0,19 July 2010
28 Days Later...," Fully formed thriller
","An early movie in the DV release bonanza of our current age of film-making, Boyle's 28 Days Later... is a zombie movie that challenges the automatous hordes of moviegoers to treat them to a movie that first redefines zombies in a new and appealing way, and then proceeds to set them loose in a three-part story arch that explores the depths of humanity's inhumanity to other humans.Most viewers need little experience in the zombie genre to recognize the impact of Romero's infamous zombie trilogy on almost all subsequent zombie thrillers ever after, and while this one definitely has its nods, it takes more inspiration from actual crimes of humanity (Bosnia, Saddam's gassing of the Kurds, an explosion in northern Ireland, Sierra Leone, and Pol Pot, amongst others) and the anxiety of a modern world set to eventually face a great pandemic, and compresses it into a theme of apocalyptic emptiness set to Godspeed You! Black Emperor! Sound good enough yet? It also contains fantastic performances and a huge presentation of substance-based style that pulls together a story arch bound to be entertaining for anyone ranging from zombie-buffs to serious cinema enthusiasts always looking for the next post-modern symbolism launcher.--PolarisDiB",10,0,1,22 November 2005
Cars," Better than ever, good as always
","Man, I cannot believe Pixar. I felt they were going to start to slip when they released The Incredibles and I thought it was just another superhero movie, when it turned out to be an exploration of discovering your identity and knowing who you are and what you can do. Then I thought Cars looked kind of uninteresting and reviews that called it derivative didn't help. However, though this movie may be a bit derivative, it still is a huge helping of Pixar heart.Everything about this movie exceeded my expectations. I thought I'd hate the characters, especially Lightning and Mader because Lightning is selfish and Mader is voiced by Larry the Cable Guy, but I ended up really liking both (and all of the other characters too). I didn't believe Pixar could have made their animation even more stunning, but they did, both with high technological neon lighting animation and gorgeous natural vistas. Heck, I thought the movie would feel preachy, but it still feels very caring.It's also a slight return to form after the Incredibles in that it returns to homages of cinema past and tie-ins to other Pixar works, something that is both fun to look for and shows how much the crew working at Pixar really love their job. These films are still really magnificent and I can't wait for Ratatouille coming in 2007.--PolarisDiB",9,5,6,11 July 2006
X-Men: The Last Stand," No.
","I have never expected to like any of the X-men movies. The first X-men surprised me with how willing it was to take the time to develop so many different characters, and X2 had enough good action and follow-up character development to make it surprisingly good as well. With the mixed reviews of this one, I figured I wouldn't like it at all. I liked some of it; it exceeded my expectations. But it's still highly flawed and I don't like the direction it took.The key problem with this movie is that it makes the ultimate transition away from what the mutant's powers MEAN to focusing more on what they DO. That means while the writers and Ratner were more than willing to figure out interesting battles, they lost track of a lot of motifs and arcs that could fully encompass the general trend of the movies and make it very good. The driving force behind the franchise has always been the tension between mutants and humans and what to do with that tension, but this one seemed much more willing to give that (and any actual drama) second tier to just hurrying up and getting through all the events that it seems must take place. Unfortunately for Ratner, removing the drama and the point makes the events not matter, which means ultimately a very poor cinema experience.For example, most of the mutants introduced are no longer introduced by how important they are to the main circle and how they help range the debate and understand this new world everyone's entering... mostly they're just introduced as a contrivance to get the plot moving along. I'm definitely not the only one who thinks Angel could have been cut completely from the movie and not changed much. Leech and Phoenix also suffer this fractured character arch, most especially represented by the completely anticlimactic and unnecessarily random ending: The driving force of involving Leech is that he can suck powers away. The driving force of involving Phoenix is that she has an excess of power. Well look at that, don't those two make a great opposites cancel out! Unfortunately, I think the writers decided not to go that route because it would be too obvious... or worse, they didn't even think of it. Whatever the case, they missed a precise and organized denouement to the proceeds, ultimately causing both threads to be mostly spectators to the events as they unfold instead of their supposed function of indicators. In fact, now that I think about it, nothing in explaining who Phoenix is explains why she'd join Magneto like that anyway.This complete lack of functionality is further proof of the loss of focus on what the powers mean. I mean, come on... She's a phoenix, literally. Rise from the grave, more power, passionate... the openness to symbolism and the effect on the human/mutant debate is almost limitless.... did Ratner care? No, he seemed more interested in presenting situation after situation which ultimately proves that we're not even going to pretend Wolverine can die at this point.In fact, for a movie willing to kill off very iconic characters (though, maybe, not really...), it seems unwilling to really understand what killing off those characters will ultimately mean to the remaining mutant characters. Deaths are dealt with with a quick moment of silence and then a discussion of what to do next. There is no grief, or fear, or guilt or anything. What it really feels like Ratner says to his production during these scenes is, 'All right, the audience already knows what this means to the characters and stuff, no need to linger... let's move on to the next scene.' Not only does that suck the drama right out of the proceeds, it also pretty much destroys its pacing.Luckily for it, the movie has some pretty strong moments spattered here and there despite itself. The race between Juggernaut and Kitty was excellent, and for some reason I really started digging the enmity between Pyro and Bobby (even if it did feel like a cheap Star Wars rip-off from time to time). I also loved the imagery around the protesters and the people waiting for the cure, because during that time the movie alludes to famous protests from around the world.Otherwise, the movie was just overstuffed and under-functional. Even the dialog represents that, with Wolverine officially sounding like he's trying to be James Bond, all of the good lines taken straight from different works, some rather redundant lines like 'And that's why the pawns go first,' and so on. I have no doubt in my mind that subsequent X-men will lose further sight of what makes the franchise good, and they're beginning their full decent here. Oh well, it was fun while it lasted.--PolarisDiB",4,1,2,3 June 2006
The Incredibles," 'Monsieur Incroyable!!!'
","Ahhh, Pixar... that animation company that dares to make movies with plots... and good animation to boot! Brad Bird brings us through Pixar animation studios a story about the hero in all of us... actually, that's a lie, as it's pretty much the exact opposite, it's about the hero trying to be just like all of us. 'Mediocrity, that's the hard thing to do,' said Edna in her interview. Indeed it seems almost completely destructive to a family that just wants to do what they're good at doing.This movie is filled with everything from the big to the small... big action with amazing animated effects juxtaposed with small moments like Mrs. Parr (Elastigirl) and Mr. Parr (Mr. Incredible) cleaning up around the house... characters with the big aspirations to save the world with characters just hoping to be happy for a moment... big superheroes being belittled by small fashion designers...I suppose some could say that the story is 'predictable' or 'formulaic.' Booo! It is both, but it's not like one can notice with all the other stuff going on. Everything from the story to the animation to the voice acting to the soundtrack is enough to keep anyone's attention on ONE good aspect. When the villain is revealed it's not about it being a, 'Oh my, that's who it is, I am so surprised!' it's a, 'Oh of course it's THAT guy.' That's why he's revealed so early on in the movie... predictable. Ya crazy nitpickers.At any rate it's a fun feast o' animation that, along with Pixar's other works, sets a high standard (that I have found contemporary animation studios seem unable to reach, in my humble opinion). Sometimes I worry if they'll be able to keep it up but Cars looks really amazing after a few interviews I saw about it. I guess I'll just have to place my faith in them and hope it's not squandered.--PolarisDiB",8,0,1,15 May 2006
Stardust," Good stock fantasy
","If any style of film could be called my 'guilty pleasure', it'd be this generic fantasy type. Guilty is the wrong word for it, though, as I'm pretty pleased to be an escapist from time to time. 'Stardust' is good stock fantasy, the likes of which one should expect from Neil Gaiman (or Gaiman adaptation, as it were). It isn't the visual dream-scape of Mirrormask, it isn't the adult pretension of Pan's Labyrinth, and it isn't the fun-loving classic The Princess Bride, but it contains just what the fantasy-lover is familiarized enough with to be completely comfortable during the entire viewing. Fantasy lovers should rejoice--special effects work has finally become good enough and cheap enough that this stuff is in regular production now.The story of Stardust involves a young man named Tristan who, in order to gain the love and approval of the most beautiful girl in their small town of Wall, goes on an adventure to retrieve a fallen star. To make things difficult, however, Tristan's fallen star is actually a woman named Yvaine, and he's not the only one looking for her... some witches have their greedy eyes on the immortality the star's heart can give, and a brother's feud over the magic kingdom leads murderous princes in her direction.From there it's all pretty predictable, but it involves some attractive fantasy elements, some warm-hearted commentary on the nature of love, and the best part, Robert DeNiro as a gay pirate. On that note, DeNiro's performance is spot-on... it's not the excessive lisp that most actors use to portray gay people, but a surprisingly effective one from someone used to being seen as a rough-and-gruff typecast character (thus the ongoing joke surrounding his character matching DeNiro's own opening up into alternate forms of acting). DeNiro hasn't been so unique to his own image since Brazil, and that's saying something.Stardust is the type of movie, perhaps, that will subsist on children's and fantasy-lover's shelves for a long time. I can't say it offers anything new, but it's not really there to. It's actually those most familiar with it's tropes that will enjoy it the most.--PolarisDiB",7,5,8,23 August 2007
Dog Day Afternoon," 70s classic
","For me, this movie represents everything that was magical about 70s American cinema: good direction, acting, and writing mixed with social awareness and a finely tuned, engaging narrative plot. Before studios learned the wrong lesson from Star Wars and decided that special effects blockbusters were the way to go (not totally incorrectly), American movies managed to have their cake and eat it too, as far as entertainment value AND thought were concerned.The story is of a botched robbery involving Sonny (Al Pacino) and the shady, quiet Sal (John Cazale), an event already gripping but increased by the pervading influence of media and mob mentality, counter-cultural undertones rumbling through the streets and alternative sexuality, friendly hostages, pizza deliverers and cab drivers. By all means, what sets this movie apart from any other heist movie is the crowd, which acts almost as a Greek chorus inciting the drama of the plot as they simultaneously cheer for Sonny as a hero for the under-represented and heckle the cops for representing the authority. Under the PR knowledge that the cops can't shoot Sonny or risk a scene reminiscent of Attica, and they can't very well arrest him while Sal is inside the bank, slowly getting more distraught, instead the authorities are basically forced to give Sonny the stage to figure out his life and rant at society as a whole.Danger is always vibrating beneath the surface of every scene, building like an escalating earthquake, but Dog Day Afternoon is most often remembered for Sonny's cries of 'Attica! Attica!', a similar quotation in ways to Network's 'I'm ****ed off and I'm not going to take it anymore!' in expressing the sentiment of the time. This movie is almost a cathartic response to the social situation of the time, except of course for the main narrative concerns involving the robbery proper and the ultimate justice that the audience (nor the diagetic crowd) want to recognize: that this is not going to end well.In other words, its a classic of cinema from a time when making classics meant something and making a point was often respected and listened to. There are always closed-minded people out there who thumb their noses at anything they deem to be 'old movies', which essentially means any movie that came out before Fight Club (and even now that movie's starting to fall into the obscurity of 'my parents liked it so it must not be good'), but for basically everyone else in the world, this is a pretty essential classic that shouldn't be missed.--PolarisDiB",9,0,0,14 September 2008
School of Rock," You wouldn't think it at first...
","I saw the commercial for this movie, and thought it seemed like a real groaner. Let's put the silly music-based humor of Jack Black from Tenacious D and his role in High Fidelity and put it in a non-religious Sister Act II.Well, I was wrong.While there isn't really much in the way of being really 'spectacular' filmicly, Linklater wisely sets the camera back and lets the real talent shine. Most dominantly, what is immediately received from this film is that these kids rock. But what's really important is that these kids really, really do rock. Combine them with the personality of Black and the acting of Joan Cusack, and you get really enjoyable performances all around.Also, Mike White's writing and roll in this film are very much worth mentioning. What seems like a typical story really does have things to say about following your dreams, but more importantly it also shows the pitfalls of those dreams as well... the characters willing to 'sell out', the fact that they don't really win the competition, the necessity of avoiding those that just want to use rock as a way to be a bum... all of that is cleverly put in there. Just Cusack's little monologue when her character's drunk in the van with Black is enough to point out that there's actually real substance behind this script and it's not just a cop-out Hollywood film.Which is great because it's also low on the overt 'stupid loser' jokes that tend to be mostly thrown around in the attempt to make a story about a supposed loser funny. It's also low on language, so really it can be very enjoyable for many reasons, whichever way you want to approach it.It seems on the cover to be a film that would be a quick fad and then eventually disappear into the annuls of lost comedies, but if it actually does, that's tragic, because it really is a film worth appreciating.--PolarisDiB",7,0,0,20 November 2005
Cars 2," Formula One
","If you mentally switch out the vehicles in Cars with post-human description of entire cyborg societies where the beings can constantly update themselves and switch out their own body's mechanics, Cars is kinda trippy.If you do that with Cars 2, you'll completely lose your mind and probably get paranoia-laced nightmares for weeks.It's not just that the characters have personalities of their own and even things like empathy, friendship, and ego that is the problem. It's the fact that they're self-aware of damage and get to choose whether to keep it or leave it while blowing each other up to smithereens, over issues like self-recognition.In other words, it's a really good movie. A few random people here and there wondered about 'how the world was supposed to work' in Cars, and it seems like Pixar responded by giving them the finger. It's not that they have that in mind while they're making it--Pixar probably meets criticism with a shrug of, 'Yeah but our movies make millions and are children's fantasies with actual stories, so we'll just go about doing our work and you can deal.' However the point I'm making here is that though the more open theme of environmentalism is going to be the one getting the most press, the subtheme of identity politics is what drives this movie (pun intended), and that makes it closer to The Incredibles 2 than any of their other works, really.However, I'm hoping that their two summers in a row of sequels is just a temporary aside while they pull together their plans for more original characters, because though their narratives aren't suffering, characters like Lightning McQueen and Mater can get to be a little insufferable. This movie is better than its original but I'm still thirsty for more.Cheers, --PolarisDiB",7,10,18,24 June 2011
Gran Torino," Redeeming qualities
","I can say that I appreciate Mystic River and Million Dollar Baby, but I never really liked them personally for whatever reason. Clint Eastwood is a very dedicated and skillful director, and it's nice this time around to see a movie that he both did really well and that I also really enjoyed watching. Those seeing the commercial of his newest release might be inclined to avoid it because of how violent and racist it is, but I appeal here and now that everyone give this one a chance--most of the 'bad parts', so to speak, are in the commercial, and the rest is pure character-driven magnificence.Eastwood plays Walt, the ostensibly racist Korean war vet that everyone's so quick to compare to grizzled bad cop Dirty Harry, but is actually a whole new anti-hero: gruff, curmudgeon-y, and generally willing to spit in the face of everyone who approaches him, he's just lost his wife and has settled to a life of fending off shallow and selfish relatives while his neighbors' kid attempts to steal his vintage Gran Torino in a gang initiation. From there it's a pretty quick gravitational attraction between him and Hmong family next door, and despite his distrust and general hateful attitude to everyone around him, they warm his heart and low and behold, he finds himself saying things like, 'I have more in common with these gooks than my own family.' Striking a friendship, he still finds that the family just cannot escape from the gang-activity crawling pestilently around the neighborhood, so he takes the kid under his wing and does what he can to protect the family.I went in expecting one movie and ended up with a much better one. Like some others, I was expecting something more like a Dirty Harry meets Million Dollar Baby, and even throughout the movie it kept feeling like it could rapidly devolve into a vengeance narrative like Taxi Driver; instead, there's a lot of humanistic humor, good-will, and caring behind Eastwood's permi-scowl, and eventually the narrative is more like a mature deconstruction of those very expectations the audience has. Eastwood seems to be revisiting the architypes of his past and redefining them, partially because he no longer seems interested in violence as a justification for entertainment but as a real-world problem to deal with. Still, in this one he seems to be delighting in keeping people on their toes, and there are many things you'll leave with both expected and unexpected.As much as this movie wasn't as 'hard' as I expected it, it did have a very real and very devastating awareness of just how violent and deadly these things can be. Tension runs high through a lot of it because it's really hard to see such fleshed-out characters get hurt. It's interesting that a lot of movies that have come out recently, like Synecdoche New York, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, and The Wrestler, have been deeply invested in seeing people at the ends of their lives searching desperately for a re-evaluation of their value. Eastwood's particular concern in many of his later movies is redemption. Gran Torino fits right in with recent menu, while also being its own wonderful serving.",8,1,4,18 January 2009
Shrek the Third," An hour and a half
","First thing's first: Yes, Shrek the Third features The Eels. Twice, in fact! Good, now that we've gotten past the important part...Shrek the Third is, well, an hour and a half. That is to say that if you want to spend an hour and a half, this is a great way to do it, but if you want to spend that hour and a half enjoying yourself, or maybe even not enjoying yourself, or hey, feeling ANYTHING, then maybe you should reserve that hour and a half for something that isn't Shrek the Third. Shrek the Third isn't bad, I don't want to say it's really even tedious. Heck, it actually spends the time allotted to it quite concisely. There's no real way to say it, though--this movie provides absolutely no reaction. It wasn't just me: none of the forty some-odd people in the theatre seemed to have much to do either, except maybe the couple in the back, who tried desperately to make their forced laughter seem genuine. Then again, it might be their fault--nothing kills a mood like forced laughter.Here's the deal: Shrek and Fiona are, you know, dealing with married life and stuff when ol' King Fiona's Father Whatsits decides to croak (get it, croak? He's a frog? Get it? Get it? I should be a Shrek writer). Shrek doesn't want to inherit the kingdom, as his step-father wishes, so he goes off to find Arthur Pendragon, the next-heir-in-line. Meanwhile mean ol' Prince Charming has some designs for taking the kingdom for himself. Also, Shrek is worried about becoming a father. Funny thing is, you know this already, as every single review, synopsis, and advertisement for this movie details this. You probably already know the ending. You probably know the middle. Heck, even if you haven't seen this yet, you know all the gags.But even that would be slightly acceptable (except knowing the gags) if this movie had any, howdoyousayit, um, 'umph' to its jokes. Instead it is lazy and tired. Big bad Shrek just smiles and quietly shrugs off every situation that doesn't involve a spewing baby or a fart joke. Fiona worries around. Donkey, Puss'n'boots, Gingerbread Man, and Pinocchio reference the jokes that they're known for, and run around doing their supporting gags supportingly. In other words, everything that is is, and is what is expected, but isn't enough to really be, if that makes any sense. Believe me, it makes more sense than figuring out why this movie is making as much as it is.Anyway that's about all I can really muster to mention about something so unmentionable. Normally I'd recommend waiting for rental or discount theatres or something, but to be perfectly honest I can't think of a single reason to go see this movie at all. Oh, wait, yes I can: it features The Eels. Twice! --PolarisDiB",3,8,11,18 June 2007
The Hurt Locker," The New Arena
","Sometimes, we take war for granted. Between arguing about its inevitability and lack thereof, there is also the constant debate over wars' similarities to previous engagements, the historical justifications, mistakes, and results of previously wars, and the analysis of wars' evolution through theory, technology, and influence. Since filmmaking arrived, a social relationship to war has changed as visions of the actual carnage have been brought back to viewers, a constant redefining of social relationships between cultures during wartime up to the infamous Desert Storm, the ultimate post-modern climax point of war AS entertainment, virtual reality, and institutional product wrapped up in full media exposure and alienating digitized distance. However, the essential thing people miss when they get caught up in these ideas is the point where regardless of whatever people believe about the 'essential nature' of war or otherwise, and no matter how planned out the engagement from the military's side, or the training of the military thereof, each war, unfortunately, is very different.Iraq has provided filmmakers with another opportunity to bring up age-old questions about wars anew, but the relative failure of previous Iraq War films to stick, I believe, is because most of the new films are fundamentally structured around previously developed war films and their respective themes, meaning for the last seven years people have been desperately trying to turn Iraq into a visual desert-arena Vietnam. With a new arena, however, comes a new structure, and Bigelow actually points directly to the specific difficulties in this contemporary engagement. Choosing to relegate thematic statements to second-tier, Bigelow's interest is in the arena itself, and the anxiety and fear of a core group of soldiers attempting to navigate a foreign maze of booby traps among a foreign civilization of nearly undecipherable motivations.The Hurt Locker is a thriller structured with a classic horror trope: within the first five minutes, the film's arguably biggest name star is killed off, and from there the audience is invited to guess at the rate of survival of the remaining cast. However, in most horror films the unknown revealed is the first step towards resolution and understanding of the 'monster', whereas in The Hurt Locker, the soldiers' dawning understanding of the source of their conflict is met with uncertainty, indecision, and downright paranoia. James begins brash and under control, with enough experience to navigate the most web-like of demolitions, only to slowly fall apart as even the simplest relationships become a cross-confusion of static and misinterpretation. His impatience with radio communication at the beginning, in that regards, is significant: he goes into this engagement with no desire to understand, but only to do a mission. By the end, his own motivations and emotional addictions are in full question, and he is unable to remove his sense of mission from his own identity from the trauma of constant uncertainty.As for the actual motivations of the Americans themselves, the movie is a little more straight-forward. Bigalow's presentation of them is balanced basically because she lets them be selfish, kind, arrogant, and completely disturbed as the action goes along, rather than firmly placing any character into type from frame one. More importantly than tracing a specific character arc, Bigelow instead makes the movie a series of specific engagements, from IED set-ups to cross-sniper fire, from kidnapping to being kidnapped, and then formulates the characters' relationships to each other from there. In each new 'day' presented as the end of their service draws near is a new set-up for the characters to begin trying to understand again, both with the enemy and each other, and ultimately no clear standard of engagement is presented. This is exactly representative of the strenuous advance as it has been reported in Iraq, as each and every new day provides completely new conflicts for the soldiers to work out.--PolarisDiB",8,13,20,24 July 2010
No Man's Land," Well-timed trap
","This 2001 Oscar winner for best foreign film is basically a simple remonstration against the absurdities of war: two men caught between their sides on the Serbo-Bosnian conflict and a wounded soldier laid over a bouncing Betty are forced to deal with their own hatred and dehumanization of each other while their respective armed forces, the UN, and global media reporters prove entirely impotent to do anything to save them. It proves very effective at being both hilariously funny (the two men arguing over who 'started it' like little children, having to constantly one-up each other with weapons, and running around half naked trying to grab attention so that they can get help) and darkly desperate (their inability to fully lay down arms, the lack of care by the higher ups of any of the potential saviors, the leaving of the prone soldier to his own fate upon the land mine).The best part about it is that it presents its themes rather directly and earnestly without pounding it in too hard or lingering on it--even with an almost two-hour runtime, it actually breezes by never puts too fine a point on it; it knows when to end and it progresses fluidly through the plot the entire time. The pacing on this film is almost immaculate and the writing is really good, so that by the end it's really very satisfying even if it does provide a rather dark denouement.--PolarisDiB",8,0,3,28 February 2008
Patton," Underwhelming
","Patton was a romantic, a man who dreamt of glory, a man who put everything into pursuing his dreams of battle and prestige... so why does he seem so small? In an attempt to demystify the controversial general that has met both the scorn and respect of people and other military officials alike, 'Patton' has become an underwhelming picture. George C. Scott's amazing acting is placed far from the camera, often framed next to taller and bigger people and things, making him look small, separate, even unappealing. The famous shot at the beginning of Patton in front of the gigantic American flag is at first really visceral, but thinking back on it, I realize it becomes a structural set-up for the mythic hero constantly set beside things that overshadow him. It's almost depressing.Of course he was, after all, just a man... but this movie seems to go to such great lengths to stress that at times that sometimes I wonder why the creators even wanted to do the project at all. If it wasn't for Scott's grandiose portrayal, I would think that this movie would overshadow Patton so much that he'd disappear from the screen altogether.What this movie does succeed with, in my opinion, is pointing out how different modern war is from 'classic' wars in human history. WWII was the last war in which America had enemies that marched... in fact it was the last chance someone like Patton had to truly succeed in the way he did. Everything since has changed so much and the process differs so greatly that one of the reasons the US has had problems with wars ever sense is because we haven't yet recognized that we're not playing the same game as we were before. Everything's evolved and Patton in the movie is afraid of that, and it's for that reason that this movie still has something to offer.--PolarisDiB",5,9,24,6 November 2006
La Grande Illusion," A quick review for a deeper film.
","It was only after this movie that I went through some of my logs, lists, reviews, and whatnot and realized that I've never seen a Renoir film before this one. What the ... ? Anyway, this movie is about how war democratizes class politics, despite the pomp and standing of the various individuals involved, shown through the actions of a bunch of POW officers during WWI. It has a very good ending, but Renoir isn't quite finished making all his points yet and it continues on, including a minor love story and some more character development before finally concluding. The most remarkable thing about this movie is that it was made in the 30s... in the midst of depression, between WWI and WWII, and it definitely shows that the issues of WWI weren't resolved before the fighting concluded. In that way, it's a pretty observant and poignant film.--PolarisDiB",7,0,1,23 August 2007
The Illusionist," Darn
","You know, I heard a lot about this film while it had its theatrical run, and I even made plans to see it in the dollar theatre (but woke up too late), so I was very excited to finally get a chance to see it. Turns out it was pretty disappointing. Which was surprising, so I guess I can give it that (not really).Here we have your typical low-class guy falls in love with high-class girl flick, mixed with the typical brown-tinted period piece. Edward Norton plays a gifted young magician who must save Jessica Biel's young duchess from the evil upper-class boyfriend who is the crown prince. Seems ol' poor boy's shared love with rich pretty lady is controversial in its time, and now he has to use all his tricks of illusion and sleight-of-hand to save her from marrying the evil guy who's not only a jerk, but planning to overthrow the throne as well! Now, all this could possibly be interesting if it weren't for the fact that the first scene pretty much gives away the first half of the movie, and then the first half definitely gives away the second. I find it to be a sign of pretty bad storytelling if a movie that subsists on tricks and illusions is always at least two scenes behind me.That would also possibly be acceptable mostly because of good performance. Edward Norton does well. Paul Giamatti does what he does best. Biel and who's-his-face who played the crown prince sucked, and worse, the script pretty much assumed we already detested the boyfriend for whatever reason and only provided a few examples (eh, I suppose he was rude), and missed out on what could have been an intriguing battle of the wits between the two enemies.So you have Norton and Giamatti acting really well in a brown movie. Okay.--PolarisDiB Favorite Quote: 'The sword to its rightful owner!' Rating: 2.5 out of 5 stars.",5,1,3,12 January 2007
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," Enjoy your time and don't worry about the sentiments
","A lot of what one gets out of a movie has to do with their expectations going in, and I had read a lot about this movie when going into it. Turns out I think critics, especially negative critics like Roger Ebert, are taking this thing a bit too seriously. What we have here is a warm American fantasy, a magical-realism story of aging both inoffensive in its worldview and unpretentious in its approach. Everyone else is either calling it genius or stupid, and I don't know why. I'd rather just enjoy it for what it is.Lots of names connected to this one, and lots of reading into the movie for them. Here's a recommendation: forget David Fincher. He's a good, visual director, but this movie shares little of his nihilistic sense of humor found in movies like Se7en, Fight Club, and Alien 3. Forget F. Scott Fitzgerald, whose work is much more about the social spectrum and whose original short story was much more satirical in nature. Instead, remember Eric Roth, the screenwriter of Forrest Gump, because that is much more akin to this film--in fact, they share roughly the same structure, with some minor adjustments for a new malady. I'm not complaining, either, because I happen to like Forrest Gump for what it is and this movie had a lot of the same pathos, which made it heartwarming without being trite.Sure, it's not perfect... besides the anachronism of the backward-aging conceit, there's a few anachronisms in the general layout, and history buffs will probably find a lot to nitpick in it. Whatever. It was a fun movie with only that slight unfortunate tendency to believe that everything that happened before 1950 was tinted yellow and brown (why do filmmakers insist on doing that?!?!). There's been a lot of Oscar murmurings and grumblings about this, but frankly I don't really see it. Brad Pitt, for instance, does a great job as an old guy but as soon as he hits roughly his own age, it's all being Brad Pitt from there on out--you can sense the palpable shift in character and worldview from innocent underaged old-man to knowing-he's-a-sex-bomb Pitt re-enacting Brando's Wild One in small asides. The first half of the film feels very different from the second half, though that's not really a bad thing because a lot of things change throughout the film and the perspective is intentionally one of them.I thought it was finely crafted in terms of time and motivation of the characters, and I liked the small details such as the grave without writing on it (because he couldn't remember what the name was). The love story is disappointing if you're expecting the usual formula in two star-crossed lovers who somehow get pulled apart and have to find their way back together, because that happens by the time the movie is halfway done; but it's not disappointing if you're expecting a variant of it. Again, remember Forrest Gump.This movie seems destined to be overrated with subsequent backlash, which is really unfortunate for what it is. It's a compelling tale worthy of escapism and the pathos it generates, that somehow people insist on believing is some Big Art that should win Oscars and Be Immortalized--which basically means that a year from now you'll be hearing all sorts of sass from people who believe that they were too smart for it when it came out, even though they're singing its praises today. I hate it when that happens to a good movie like this one.--PolarisDiB",7,0,1,1 January 2009
Transformers," Giant robots standing around looking impressive does not count as action.
","Boredom isn't an argument, it's a complaint. Because of this fact, I try to avoid using the term 'boring' to describe any movie, no matter how boring it is, instead searching for some better way of criticizing it. However, I think there's no other real way to express it this time: Transformers is a very boring movie. Here's why.I went to the movie theatre to see giant robots fighting each other! Yeah, I got some of that... maybe about 25 minutes of it all told in a movie that was two hours and twenty minutes long! The rest of this behemoth was filled with scene after inconsequential scene of not much happening except the following three types of dialog:1) The characters trying to be characters. I.e., Shia LeBeouf: 'I want a car! This is my car! My car is an alien robot! Car car car! Worry about my car! What should I do about my car? I just wanted a car!' Jon Voight: 'What is this, Chinese? Korean? Iraqi? Afghanistani? What? How should we deal with this? What is it? Why do I know nothing of this?' Optimus Prime: 'We're here to fight for the human race, which has a choice, and that choice is a freedom, and there must be sacrifice, and, and, well, we're not much better race either!' Jon Turturro: 'I can tell I'm a completely useless character, so I'm just gonna be a jerk until I'm supposed to be a friend, or something! It's all because I have power because I have a badge!'2) Self reflexive junk: 'This is 100 times better than Armageddon!' (Hey Mike? None of us remember that POS movie. You could at least have said 'The Rock' or, if you were more daring, a recently released movie from a different studio, perhaps.)3) Ill-fitted and awkwardly random social awareness: 'I'm willing to bet my ridiculous government salary that...' 'I'm sure if anything was going on, the government would tell us, right? Right? Hint hint hint!' All of these things would have been at least a little fun if there was any amount of intelligence or wit behind it, but most of these moments are simply shoved into a giant, glurgy sentiment that goes on literally for hours with only the occasional transformation or rifle burst to keep interest. The apotheosis of this approach has its form in the scene in Sam Wicwicky's bedroom, where a relatively simple scene of him trying to find his grandfather's glasses turns into a twenty-minute bumbling session involving stupid parents talking about masturbation and earthquakes, stupid robots destroying a yard for no reason but to be funny, and way too much of Shia LeBeouf yelling at both of them. By the time that scene alone is over, Transformers has already lost a huge amount of momentum. It doesn't really pick up after that, and it's still a good half an hour before the final battle scene takes place.Michael Bay seems to have lost something, somewhere. Not that he was ever the greatest director in the first place, but at least one could depend on him for some action. This movie just doesn't have it. It has no suspense. Whenever things finally do get going, Bay seems to prefer to cut to a character worrying over something else, which ruins the moment. Hell, half the time the movie goes back and forth between night and day as if the average earth day is about three hours in length! The directing is lazy, the dialog is poor, and even the good actors have a difficult time truly making their characters seem zany or even interesting. The really bad part is how most of the action is resolved. The little spy robot thing that follows everyone around? Accidentally knocks its own head off. The defeat of Megatron? Accidentally activating the Cube... Oh, so that's all that had to be done? Great, let's go home now. And how does that have anything to do with 'sacrifice'? And why do we need a grandiose speech by Optimus Prime about how, like, humanity has hope or some crap like that?Forget it. This would have been a perfectly reasonable 45 minute movie, maybe stretched out to an hour fifteen for good measure. Instead it was two hours of painfully dull and unimportant crap with only just enough action to even claim that a giant robot war was all it was about. It's a pretty bad sign when I'm more interested in cleaning my nails than paying attention to whatever other character happens to be introduced for little purpose than to add yet another flat-trying-to-be-funny voice into the mix.I saw this movie in second-run because I didn't want to risk nine bucks on it. Even after that, I STILL want my $1.25 back. I've already run into some trouble when talking about this movie to some of my friends. 'You're over-thinking it, it's supposed to be fun!' Yeah, that's my point: I was disappointed in a movie about giant robots fighting each other. How can a movie about that not be fun? Bay somehow managed--PolarisDiB",3,25,40,1 October 2007
Children of Men," Amazing takes and gripping story
","This film is pretty superb. I still haven't seen Y Tu Mama Tambien (I'm ashamed...) but I was really impressed with Alfonso Cuaron's work in, of all things, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban. Cuaron put the long takes and multiple depths and fantastic background in that movie to provide magic to a series seriously lacking in what it's all about (and I don't think any of the subsequent movies are going to ever be as good). Thus, knowing he had made a Science Fiction dystopian flick, I was intrigued.Going back to the idea of long takes.... talk about long takes. Cuaron has somehow taking the complicated shots through multiple stories and buildings and sets that everyone is so impressed that PT Anderson can do and has stuffed it with more complications with a world falling apart from violence and despair. It adds to the tension of a dramatic lack of hope so much that I think if it wasn't for the comedic relief of Jasper (Michael Caine!), I don't think I could have made it through it.It's about the world twenty years in the future where humanity has suddenly ceased to procreate. Clive Owen plays a depressed and inanimate man who suddenly finds himself trying to accompany a pregnant woman (and the world's only hope) through a world filled to the brim with rioting, anxiety, and destruction.The dirty mise-en-scene and a lot of the dystopic imagery has already brought comparisons to Blade Runner, but to me this is a whole new image. Actually, it seems to me closer to 28 Days Later, but is vastly more infinite in scale.I think this movie would be perfect if it wasn't for the fact that a lot of the dialog is filled with contemporary meaning in a little too obvious way. V for Vendetta made the same mistake of making a science fiction that was just a little TOO obviously a comment on the political realm of today. Luckily the story and the action make this into an adventure all of its own.By the way, it also has a great soundtrack. Pointedly hippy, but great nonetheless.--PolarisDiB",9,4,9,5 January 2007
"Good Night, and Good Luck."," Mediated Media
","The visual media of television and film can be a tool or it can be a toy, a means of discourse or merely an object of entertainment. At either extremes, The Media (sic) can be either a degrading escapism that unfocuses the audience away from reality, or harsh propaganda designed to center the masses towards one specific ideology.How do we treat media? How do we know where to draw the line between entertainment and discourse, objectivity and subjectivity, documentary and mise-en-scene? These are the types of questions that come immediately to mind when regarding a film of this type, one that shows the effect media can have on life, politics, and truth, both personally and publicly, while attempting to create an effect itself.The set is McCarthy-era US, the characters a group of reporters, the drama the desire to defeat the fear of McCarthyism while keeping a safe distance away from Communism to be able to do it without losing their lives. Around the desire of the characters to defeat the clouds that hang over their heads is the almost defeatism stoic resolve they feel as they press ahead with full knowledge that they could lose their jobs and maybe even their way of life in the process. All to present one message: the television is a tool, not just a flickering image.What is compelling especially of this film is its comparison to two other noteworthy films about journalism, Citizen Kane and All the President's Men. Citizen Kane, being famous for its use of deep-focus, presents a character who is decidedly subjective, while deep-focus itself is a method of objectivity. This film, Good Night, and Good Luck., presents characters who are altruistic in their belief in objectivity and standards, and yet most of it is shot with a very small depth of focus, often times leaving most or all planes of action slightly fuzzy or completely indelible. All the President's Men presents an idealistic image of heroic journalism with open, clean spaces and long, white rooms for the newspaper men to move through. This film presents characters entrapped by their surroundings, already pre-imprisoned before they've even had the chance to fight back. Shadows cover the frame, and the edges of the shots are all dark.As a method of presentation, Clooney chooses to show the antagonist, McCarthy, through found media, acquired documentary images of actual things that he had done and said. This has a profound two-fold effect: on one hand, it's verite style creates an objective McCarthy, the real man, a knowledge that he actually existed and said such things. On the other hand, it means we never really see the diagetic McCarthy, the one that fits into the story. As a way of presenting a villain, it means that it's impactful to have true media, but on the other hand it removes said media from the audience twice, once as a mediated image between actual event and audience sitting on their couch, and once as said image being re-imposed through yet another screen, creating two layers of pixellation to affect our imagining of this character. The characters in the film struggle with presentation, thus reminding us post-structurally that we are being presented something by Clooney, meaning the discourse has been removed from us enough that we have to call into question the character of McCarthy as he was presented, not as he was.Now this is not some banal nor malevolent attempt by Clooney to create tension between the audience and the discourse, it's meant almost entirely of an expression of the issues with subjective media and the effects on human rights and their potential for abuses. The problem with mediating media is that it can't help but call attention to the director's own bias, whether or not that is the point, even if the audience didn't initially question the producers of the original medium.Such semiotic reading comes to a point where it becomes an almost infinite loop. For example: I am now writing a review about a film about an event in television about an era that ended fifty years ago. How far removed, then, are you, the audience, from the actual event? What are you to think of this film by itself from my own discourse, much less McCarthy or the era he moved within? I'm sure you, as my potential audience, are merely wondering whether or not this film is any good, or if it's worth the time to see? So I end rather bluntly and uneloquently: Yes, it's quite good, and you should see it if you get the chance.--PolarisDiB",9,8,14,21 December 2005
Caddyshack," Worth a rental and some memories
","I finally got around to seeing this well-known comedy classic. It turns out the whole Murray-vs-animatronic-gopher thing is only a small fraction of the overall comedy, which was interesting because actually the movie skips and hops over various different comedic forms on purpose, providing a somewhat well rounded, somewhat flawed sketch comedy.Bill Murray is the foul-mouthed, creepy groundskeeper presenting some of the gross-out comedy. Rodney Dangerfield is Al Czervick, successful realty investor, mixes things up with the characters with his screwball comedy. Chevy Chase is the dry-humored zen golfer. Ted Knight is 'Caddyshack''s attempt at making fun of The Man. Michael O'Keefe is the young kid providing the movie some character to get behind, and Cindy Morgan plays Lacey Underall (nice name, right?), the sex comedy aspect of the movie. They meet and play golf. There are fights, bets, gunfire, and explosions.I don't think 'Caddyshack' has aged all that well over time. Sexed up raunchy comedy has just gotten dirtier over the years, leaving most of 'Caddyshack' behind in the dust. The story doesn't flow all too well, trudging along scene by scene and often getting distracted by some other anecdote to tell. Each character seems kind of like they came out of their own comedy and were lumped together for a 'best of' skit. However, some of the more drab and dry comedy, especially coming from Chevy Chase as Ty, but also with the attempts of young Danny to get the Judge's attentions for a future he doesn't even want, not only hold up well but give this movie legs to last a bit longer. I can't say it has all that much rewatchability, though.--PolarisDiB",5,0,4,21 September 2008
The Evil Dead," Fun small, more fun large.
","Even though I own this movie on DVD, I had to catch it on a special midnight screening last night so that I could finally see it in all it's big-screen, publicly squeamish glory.I'm not saying it needs it, but on the big screen this film is so much more obviously amazing. The crazy angles and tracking shots are very involving and basically disallow the viewer from not getting trapped into its story.Especially nice about this movie is its fun. The makers obviously never wanted to let up, so it just delves right in and never stops. Not only does it not matter that a lot of the events in this film are unexplained, most of the time nobody thinks even to point that out. The movie is so true to it's own desire to just immerse and never come out for breath that it is wonderfully self-secure. It only gives a few tidbits of why things are happening to give the audience some foundation so as not to just float away in a random haze of chaos.On a smaller screen, the effects don't seem very special, but on a wide-screen, they are quite good and still very fun. The entire movie is by no means the greatest horror film in existence, but everything in it is good and just as good as it needs to be.I'd say all horror fans should see it, but especially if there's a showing in an independent theatre nearby. Then buy the DVD anyways because how else can you say you own a film where a woman gets raped by a tree? --PolarisDiB",8,1,3,29 October 2005
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," Very refreshing, surprisingly better than I expected
","The audience sits down as ten minutes of commercials scroll past, the separate groups waiting, intrigued and wanting to see Burton, Depp, and memories of Gene Wilder. The lights fade, everyone quiets, and I wonder why I spent money when I know I'm not going to like it... just look at Depp's annoying acting in the trailer! And I love Johnny Depp! Danny Elfman's score begins. I hate Danny Elfman, but of course he would be used, he's in every one of Burton's endeavors. A CGI factory makes CGI chocolate in what seems like a mockery of the same imagery used to make cookies in the beginning of Edward Scissorhands... the narrator starts; in Burton's typical fairy-tale style comes images of fairy-tale times with fairy-tale dilapidated old houses, and I'm really beginning to not like it until......it all sucks you in. You watch Charlie's family as they anticipate the finders of the Golden Tickets, and their quite acute comments on the nature of the winners. You watch as Charlie simultaneously tries to hide his hope and maintain it at the same time, along with his family's fluctuating eagerness to get a Golden Ticket. And as Charlie finds a ten dollar bill on the ground, you suddenly realize, 'Geez, this movie's a lot like the book... well, of course it was one dollar and not ten dollars, but who's really counting?' And a lot like the book it stays, with a few minor deviations which frankly are brilliant. Wonka's flashbacks into his childhood are perfect addendums to Depp's quirky new creation of the beloved character that most could not separate from Wilder, and in the end Wilder's character is still maintained because he is not blaspheme'd. Johnny Depp and Tim Burton make a new Willy Wonka that is standalone enough that all thought of Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory becomes mere nitpicking by people annoyed by change.In fact, considering the book, Willy Wonka movie, and Charlie movie, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is truly brilliant. It holds true to the book while still maintaining cinematic appeal by becoming it's own thing. It is not a remake of Willy Wonka, and thank God (or just Burton, as it was his choice anyways, right?) for that, because even though I like the older version, remakes are just incredibly tedious.Special appeal to Burton fans would be the almost demented acting of Johnny Depp... the strange grins when kids get in trouble, the timid voice when he becomes unsure of himself, the reclusive germophobe he makes of a once maudlin and glurgy character. In fact, all the characters are perfectly translated to the screen, even if they do look like porcelain dolls from time to time (I hypothesize this comes from the drawings found in many of Rhoad Dahl's books).Another great aspect of this movie is it's adherence to the musical bits in the book without really being a musical itself. Other than one other song, the Oompa Loompas sing everything, and though their music isn't really that good (I'd like to have it on a CD for laughs, but I don't really care for it otherwise), at least the situations are pretty funny, especially since all of the Oompa Loompas have the same face... and aren't like Munchkins.As the movie progresses, it deviates more and more from the book, which is fine because it feels at that point like the trust has been salvaged. If people are still worrying about details so far into this movie, then I don't really see how they enjoy very many movies at all. About the time we reach the television room scene, it begins to feel a little tedious but right then wraps up everything pretty nicely (not to say there isn't more good stuff to come, but I'm not going to give away ALL the details). Eventually the credits roll, the audience is clapping and leaving, and I'm suddenly realizing, 'Wow, that was two hours... felt like two minutes.' A sure sign of a pretty good movie if there is one.--PolarisDiB",8,1,3,17 July 2005
For Love of the Game," Curveball flies straight
","For the Love of the Game Sam Raimi throws a curveball and goes for the sports movie/romantic comedy mash-up starring Kevin Costner. The topical aside is matched by something not often seen in the average Raimi movie: subtlety and care. Luckily he pitches it good and it keeps your attention through a decently long playlength and a lot of character. Costner is never all that great and this certainly isn't one of his best roles, but there are moments when he delivers quite well--usually while he's on the sand talking to himself; the love relationship is a very well written one but it sort of suffers from Costner's lack of affect. No biggie there as it's more than made up for a tense building of parallel dramatic arcs that come to their inevitable happy conclusion in a not-unpredictable, but still satisfying way.You can tell that Raimi enjoyed taking a break from thrillers and splatstick to clear the mechanism and play catch for a little while. Kevin Costner must have enjoyed having his parents play his parents, and for what it's worth everybody else seems to enjoy themselves too.--PolarisDiB",6,0,0,3 October 2009
Hedwig and the Angry Inch," Don't procrastinate, see this now
","Good lord, I've had this movie recommended to me by many different people, but I still didn't expect for it to be this good! The reason I held it off was due to expectations--I figured it was a mock-rock flick that had Rocky Horror aspirations. I couldn't have been more wrong!I've never been a fan of glam rock, but this movie does it right and does it well. John Cameron Mitchell shows himself to not only be a stunning visual storyteller but an amazingly poignant narrator. Between interesting and well-written songs that actually really help develop the psychology of the character are expository anecdotes that range from tragic to poetic. Mitchell is not only comfortable playing a transsexual but stunningly plays a transsexual that only thinks she's completely comfortable playing a transsexual. Hedwig is a fascinating character, and 'Hedwig & the Angry Itch' is a well-made character study. What makes it all the more remarkable is its uniqueness.Michael Pitt makes an interesting costar as Johnny Gnosis, the glam rock superstar who stole his music from Hedwig. It's a hilarious and ironic statement, considering that Hedwig's music is very much about things that Johnny Gnosis is very, VERY obviously not: coming from East Berlin, being a transsexual, involving onesself with music from a very early age. Yet as the denouement reveals, there's a surprising amount of Johnny Gnosis within Hedwig, making a very bizarre doppelganger story with too many associations for me to get into right now. Whatever the case, the ending to this movie is just as haunting as the rest of this movie is entertaining.'Hedwig and the Angry Itch' is not a movie to be missed, though it does seem to recognize its own confrontational nature. It's a movie about someone unlike anybody you've ever met but who you relate entirely to like a mirror image or a sister. It's a glam-rock fest of color and kitsch. And it's a haunting commentary on stardom and dreams.--PolarisDiB",9,1,3,30 April 2007
Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix," Decent adaptation, better at least than most of the others
","After 'Goblet of Fire' I wasn't so sure seeing any subsequent Potter movies would be really worth it, considering the books keep getting longer and longer and the movies, by mainstream default, must cut a lot out to fit comfy feature presentation time. However, enough people were actually pleased with this movie that I figured I'd give it a whirl, and it turned out all right.I'm not gonna bother tedious comparisons with the book or trying to summarize that plot: let's face it, if you're at all interested in watching this movie, you've read the book and will notice the differences between book and film yourself. It's kind of a moot point, really. Here, however, is the breakdown that matters: For the very first time, it seems that the filmmakers have managed to take the best and most important scenes from 'Order of the Phoenix' and string them together in a relatively hole-less film narrative. There's some things to be wanted with Cho and Harry's relationship, and the Occlumency lessons could have offered more, but for once the film version manages to feel a little more stand-alone than the other movies, which pretty much depended on the audience's familiarity on the books to explain how one scene fit with any other. That, my friends, is a good thing.Also, of key importance is the fact that it seems they've finally managed to get casting relatively down pat. Natalia Tena as Tonks, Evanna Lynch as Luna Lovegood, and Helena Bonham Carter as Bellatrix Lestrange all do their roles well and all, except in the case of the latter (and I love you Helena, but it's true) fit pretty much pitch perfect into the characters described in the book. Now Imelda Staunton as Umbridge... THAT was absolute perfect casting with absolutely perfect acting, and not only does she delight in the role (which helps it work so well), but I think director David Yates delights in it as well, as she pretty much gets more screen-time than any other character minus Harry himself. In fact, I'm sure some fans will bemoan the pushing of Ron and Hermione into much smaller supporting roles as a necessity for making room for these two giants of the story, but honestly, it's nice to have evil-with-a-relish without having to rely on Alan Rickman all the time.Finally, I express some disappointment that the action in the Department of Mysteries had to be so cut short, but it's made up for with a pretty gorgeous battle between Dumbledore and Voldemort that's pretty much worth the price of a rental alone.--PolarisDiB",7,0,2,5 October 2007
The Graduate," Existential Quandary
","Back before existentialism was cool, we had The Graduate.Dustin Hoffman's breakout role is perfectly backed up by the story of a young, 21 year old man who falls in love with a young girl after having an affair with her mother. It sounds typical soap but really goes in directions still unexpected after all these years.The performances are powerful and affecting, even Mike Nichols'. As the actors brace their characters against one uncomfortable scene after another, Nichols keeps the camera usually very close to Benjamin, which causes an almost subjective and first person narrative while also making the screen very claustrophobic. And when the camera is far away from Benjamin (and he's looking at himself), he's usually blocked in by something, be it water or Anne Bancroft's (Mrs. Robinson's) legs.Very existential, it's a film that presents a hero who finds himself constantly alone in the world, and even his convictions seem unable to pull him together. It's not a happy movie, as the final shot of his face shows when he's riding off into the sunset that is definitely not of his dreams.Okay.Now that I'm done with the review proper, I thought I'd point out something interesting I discovered during my recent reviewing of this film.Modern day 'Indie' music is like this throwback to the acoustic folksy rock of the 60s, so of course sounds a lot like our friends Mssrs Simon and Garfunkel, who of course play the music for this wonderful movie. Also, Hoffman's hair and dress, along with his painful awkwardness and his conflict with the people who surround him ('people of society', so to speak), means that if this film was made today, it would be the Ultimate Indie Hipster Film. Hell, it's practically a Garden State, only without the cheesy happy ending and even better performances.I don't know exactly what that means, or even if it means anything at all. It's just something really interesting about how this film looks considering contemporary culture. It's not dated, per se, it's just that a lot of its motifs are weirdly similar to a cheesier and cheaper social subculture, even if it was made almost 40 years earlier.Crazy how things like that work out, huh? --PolarisDiB",10,1,2,3 November 2005
Once Upon a Time in America," Deep story that's still easy to follow.
","Crime dramas seem second only to epics in terms of relative length and pondering. For a genre that follows the lives of people who could die at any instant, crime dramas seem to relish the long takes of an actor drinking some (usually illegal) alcoholic substance, pause, smoke a cigarette, take a deep breath, stare at the camera for a while, and then deliver his response to the slowly seething other character. I think this is why I like Miller's Crossing so much... it has the general ideas and conceits of a crime drama of this nature, but it can pull it off in less than two hours.Well, okay, so let's start over. This is Once upon a Time in America, a crime drama about a man named Noodles who makes his way through the underground starting in the streets of New York and making it big during the Prohibition, eventually to find himself stuck in a quandary over his loyalty to his friends and his desire to keep them all out of trouble. In untypical genre fashion, we follow the movie through a series of flashbacks as Noodle is suddenly dug out of hiding 30+ years later by a mysterious force that seems determined to bring him back to whatever it is he's escaping from. Both parallel stories, his current life and his past life, are revealed simultaneously, each providing clues to the other's motivation. Leone ties the two together with some of the best editing techniques on film, and thus we get a deep enough story that's still easy to follow.In typical antihero fashion, we will watch our character Noodles as he makes it and breaks it, alienating friends and lovers and eventually spiraling downward from his comfort zone. GoodFellas? Godfather? The same basic structure is there, and let us focus a moment on the 'America' part of the title. If anything extra can be gleaned from the three hours and forty five minutes of this film, it comes mostly from the short conversation with the socialist. 'What, you think you'll change anything? All they'll do is rape you in the a** and keep on doing it.' We're never really presented Noodle's character as poor or not-very-well off, even in the younger stages of his career, but we understand--'The Underground', as it were, is simply a parable for American economics, of course. To follow the American Dream is at heart capitalistic, and capitalism is based on exploitation. That is why Noodles can't get the girl of his dreams even though they both love each other. That is why Noodle's era must eventually end to be replaced with a new one. That is why Noodle's eventual catharsis results basically in retirement, retirement not only from his source of income but from the memories of where that income came from.All of this is illustrated and structured around nice long zooming shots inward towards an actors face as he or she... acts. With silence, with movement, with dialog and keeping still. The characters are believable of course, but that's because we've been raised on a diet of them. What, besides the idea of the American Dream as it relates to the criminal world, keeps compelling us to sit for nearly four hours to watch Al or Robert slap hysterical women around, cavort with dangerous friends, and face down killers with a subtle scowl that suggests pure control and power over the situation? Whatever it is, this is a buffet of it. Just take the Intermission's suggestion and pause it a moment for a break, or you might digest too much and explode.--PolarisDiB",7,0,3,10 April 2006
This Is Spinal Tap," The retirement of the era
","Tonight I finally saw This is Spinal Tap for the first time, after years of knowing what I was missing and having to stave off people's incredulity that I'd have the audacity to have not gotten around to a classic. Actually, quite a lot of funny coincidences, from scratched discs to changed syllabi, got between me and experiencing this movie. Nevertheless, it is done, and all the jokes I've heard a million times I got to see in their original form.But that's not what this review is about.One thing that struck me about this movie is that yes, if I had been watching this on, say, VH-1 without a clue as to what I was watching in advance, I would have thought it was real. Fine, that's mockumentary. However, the reason why it works best is how it basically cuts straight through to the typical, clichéd rock drama of the VH-1 special genre, which makes this to me a little bit more than, say, Airplane style parody where the the whole thing is just set-up for sight gags, Mel Brooks' farces, or Shaun of the Dead loving parody/homages: it's almost an instructional video on how it's time to retire that story.It's ironic then that this movie actually generated real live shows and it ends with a 'Spinal Tap will live on' message, because it really seems most like it's pointing out how the rock doc has lost all its legs. A lot is laid on the age of the band members not only to emphasize their own mortality, but the feeling is almost as if the idea itself is in its forties and already ready to retire. Or maybe it just feels like that almost thirty years after this movie came out, sixty years from the point in which these documentaries started getting made.Anyway, the only other Christopher Guest penned movie I've seen is Best in Show, which I found far funnier (I have to admit I'm full of schadenfreude), but this one was a lot sadder. Might as well been called This is The End.This is Spinal Tap is sort of like an instructional video rock documentarists should watch to see how rock documentaries should no longer be made.—PolarisDiB",6,3,7,5 August 2011
Avatar," The tagline says it all: Enter the World
","In 1999, the Wachowski brothers made a science fiction action movie which changed the face of action for a good five years as suddenly now every movie had to have this new thing called bullet-time, which is ironic since bullet-time is essentially proto-cinematic and the first 'movement tests' of Muybridge circa 1880 were the exact same thing as bullet-time. The theme of The Matrix was essentially technophobic despite its game-changing technological spectacle because it said outright, 'Don't take that blue pill, get out of dream land and live in the real world. The sucky, barren, survivalist real world that is so much more worth saving than your tasty steak-filled dreamland.' Exactly ten years later Cameron comes out with a movie about saving the environment and the killing off of our connection with the earth, but the entire narrative is developed through the titular thematic component, avatars. And no, not just the Na'Vi avatars. EVERYBODY in this movie has an avatar. The big bad meany boss commando is never more comfortable unless he's in his Cameron-favorite Mechwarrior. The Na'Vi download themselves right into the creatures of the forest. The ore-miner general uses his corporation as his avatar. The problem is that through all of this downloading, virtual recreation, and multiple personalities is that the theme of re-connecting to the world gets lost in the pure desire to log into a different outward appearance of one's self, which is never deconstructed, but in fact reinforced by the Na'Vi's own spiritual uploading of personalities between bodies. The weird thing is that the whole idea that the world of Pandora is a giant synaptic brain really never seems to be of consequence until the battle at the end, except that we're just supposed to believe in it based on what characters say, not what is shown. Whereas The Matrix makes it's downloading program quite clear from the, uh, intro screen. You know, that famous intro screen? Pandora never really makes its presence known except for an action sequence. I'm just sayin'.The only two quotes that mattered: 'I see you now.' And, 'Now real life felt more like the dream.' These are the rough equivalents to The Matrix's 'Why do my eyes hurt?' and 'Stop trying to hit me and hit me.' Therefore, as much as I'm not really as critical of other people about Avatar's storytelling and themes (it's all archetypical and not worth getting upset over or endless comparisons to similar story lines), I just feel it's necessary to point out that wherein the medium is the message, the message of Avatar is 'Log in.' It's a technophiliac celebration of virtual reality, and functionally so. I do not, in fact, consider that to be a negative thing or really criticize that approach, I just feel with the amount of attention this movie is getting, I have not really heard that acknowledged. So going to those people who are sad 'cause Pandora ain't real--it is, in fact, functionally dialectic to the experience of the film. Wherein fan culture develops through cultural events such as this film, I see Avatar as predominantly an invitation, and it's one that the world has seemed to accept. So now that the game has changed and 3D is the blockbuster motif, it is time to start reappraising fantasy worlds and figure out how to immerse the audience into truly alternative realities than simply escapist worlds.--PolarisDiB",6,1,3,21 February 2010
Drag Me to Hell," Love letter to Sam Raimi, by DiB
","Oh. Oh God yes. Oh man. Oh yes.Sam, it's been hard. Those were some dark times you went through, making those Spider-Man movies, producing those horrible Grudge movies, falling from grace. I've always kept with you because I've always figured that you were so much more than the sum of your oeuvre, and that some day you would come back with something special, something noteworthy and fun once again. I have just come back from seeing Drag Me to Hell, and Sam--I've missed you. I've missed you so much. I didn't even know how much I missed you until I saw you once again, almost as if for the first time.You've always been a remarkable person, you know? Fun-loving, entertaining, with a grin on your face that makes the world smile. It just seemed as if you got tired, disinterested, depressed. It was so sad seeing you throw away so much on such a big project when we will always remember you from your optimistic Evil Dead years. What I didn't expect was for you to actually improve, to build on it. If horror is porn complete with money shot, you've learned the importance of foreplay and a little mouth to mouth. Actually, a lot of mouth to mouth. Actually, A LOT of mouth to mouth. You dog...But I've never felt so warm as for what you've done for me tonight, and you know what? I forgive you. It's my fault, really, I shouldn't have ever doubted you. Nobody's perfect and no filmmaker is going to have a 100% amazing filmography of classics, and I was wrong to imagine that you were becoming anything less than what you are. Good or bad, you're still Sam Raimi and you know what you want, and you are willing to work for it. Other people may or may not doubt you in the future, but Sam? From now on, I'll stick by your side.Thank you, --PolarisDiB",10,5,10,29 July 2009
Grindhouse," The best tasting trash in the galaxy
","Now, I expected to enjoy this movie, and everything I heard about it had me ready for some fantastically kitsch entertainment... but I have to be honest and say...WOW, I wasn't expecting to enjoy it THAT much! Rodriguez and Tarantino have managed to recreate the experience quite well, almost to the point where it's surreal. Everything down to the 'Prevue' and 'Feature Presentation' screens really give it a trashy-somewhat-70s vibe (which actually makes the use of cellphones in the movies feel a little awkward) that brings you right into the mindset you need to be in to watch a kick butt zombie movie followed by a car-racing thriller. And I don't know what people are talking about when they complain about Tarantino's dialog... everything in this movie is well-paced, and how can dialog about 'Vanishing Point' be considered pretentious? In fact, the different ways in which Rodriguez and Tarantino use the 'degraded film' effect shows Tarantino's own fun with himself: the biggest jump cuts involve jumps in the dialog editing, causing several lines to be repeated awkwardly during 'reel transistions.' It's a fitting production of a particular director's own approach to film-making.Which is one of the reasons this movie succeeds at being so fun. Even through all the degraded imagery, one can tell that Rodriguez and Tarantino know what they're doing, and do what they want, and love what they do. Sometimes the higher budget shines through the pseudokitsch, which especially happens during Rodriguez's segments, but still there's a recognition of the importance of the original 'quality' of these types of films and the reason why they are so endearing despite their lesser budgets and construction.This event is not to be missed, really. It's fun, it's trashy, it's hilarious, it's bloody-good, and, oh, it's fun. Even after three hours of this stuff I didn't feel like I had enough, so after I went home I dragged out my b-movie collection and kept right on watching. Never have I watched a movie before where afterward I found myself hoping they make an almost endless array of followups. I know I'd pay money to see 'Werewolf Women of the SS.' I do have one complaint, and it's a minor one: Tarantino does need to realize that his screen presence isn't nearly as interesting as his name entails. His presence in both features was distracting and at times somewhat obnoxious. I had a lot more fun with everyone else hamming it up when he wasn't around.--PolarisDiB",9,0,2,18 April 2007
Saw," Good premise, mediocre actualization
","This movie starts out very strongly. Two men wake up in an old, isolated bathroom chained to pipes and with a dead body between them. As they slowly start to figure out what's going on, they discover clues to a puzzle that they must get out of; if they don't in time, they'll die (in various ways). It's all an elaborate scheme thought up by a serial killer named Jigsaw who's out to do something about people who don't appreciate their lives in the way he feels they should.The plot--and general creepiness and scare factor--are weakened once we start playing the 'flashback and twist' game. The doctor fellow knows who this killer is, because he used to be a suspect in the case... and thus the story gets told directly to us. And from there the movie loses most of its power. Instead of working out a great mystery over how this all came to be, we're just TOLD it (but with twists, see, because twists a good horror movie make). Instead of being confined, literally, to this room to find all the clues, we're taken on asides to other characters, one of which was completely superfluous (Danny Glover's detective character... seriously, could have not been in the movie at all and probably wouldn't have changed anything). And then we get some weird form of selective memory: 'Oh gee, I just now remembered what happened to me yesterday! Now that it's important for the audience to know!' So it's definitely not what I would call the most tightly wound thriller, but the premise is a very good one. Knowing the way sequels work (and the fact that there are two already), I doubt they'll pump much more strength into the loose ends of this first one, so it's a shame that this great idea turned out pretty mediocre.However, it was fun to watch anyway. It made up for superfluousness by inventing even more crazy traps and characters. One scene was so full of glurge it was ridiculous: 'And did you? Did you turn out a better person?' '*Cries* He saved me!' I believe these situations would do a lot more to permanently damage people's lives than make them realize how important life is. I think that's part of the point of having him, is that he has this great idea but is too insane to realize that it would backfire, and just ends up hurting and killing people.So ultimately, fun to watch, not the greatest slice of horror pie ever.--PolarisDiB",6,1,1,5 July 2006
Super 8," Hard-edged nostalgia with lens flare.
","You know how James Bond is now tougher, Batman is now darker, and slashers have become 'torture porn'? Stephen Spielberg's nostalgia-laced children's adventure land is likewise more dysfunctional and militant.This movie is unapologetically advertised LENSFLARE and sold as a Spielberg homage, not just his own movies but the rippled effects therefrom. The way LENSFLARE the PR for this movie went, I was rather surprised they didn't hand out a checklist card with a 'Find the movie reference!' list on it, but actually the references LENSFLARE were really more understated than it seemed, and the nostalgia surprisingly LENSFLARE more sincere than it was sold as. What's more interesting than Abrams' beloved Super 8mm childhood is the fact that that idea LENSFLARE is put to the background as a series of plot points that serve the popcorn LENSFLARE adventure just as well as any other device could, just as the story could have been told in any decade but forced itself into the 70s/80s to fit LENSFLARE the device. All of LENSFLARE this would be fine but Abrams I feel makes a misstep in actually not keeping the movie confined to the essential elements that he, and we as audience, are LENSFLARE there for: the childhood adventure.Instead it is more adult and darker. Now the thing about those wonderful Spielberg and company movies is that they were a lot more adult than subsequent generations of children's entertainment, featuring potty language and blood and monstrous thrills amidst the otherwise magical fantasyland. However what I mean by more adult and darker here is the way the movie loses focus, breaks away from the kids' perspective (which could easily have been maintained by sticking to the Super 8 camera motif) to do its evol military thing, investigative local cop, adult grief, and all layered into a movie that handles it well but didn't really need any of it. Again, The Goonies, ET, Gremlins, so on, they had those hints, adults struggling with something difficult the kid doesn't fully understand, forces beyond the community's control threatening their livelihood, the alienation of the kid familiarized by the alienation of the alien, but yet again, from the kid's perspective. Here it's laid out bare and thus much more hard edged and cynical in what is otherwise supposed to be a return to innocence. James Bond doesn't just flirt with Moneypenny anymore, now he's a vengeful force of nature. Batman doesn't just quietly suffer his traumatic past but fights moral conundrums as aggressively as his opponents. Slashers don't just go out for blood but lock victims in rooms to protract the bloodletting. And now we don't worry about Han shooting first or walkie talkies replacing rifles 'cause we've already an entire suburban landscape blowing up from out of control heavy artillery.So when's nostalgia not nostalgia and innocence not innocent? Perhaps that would be the point except that it clearly isn't. The characters are written very lucidly to type, Chunk is now a burgeoning director, Data is now a fireworks fanboy, Andy is now a neglected loner girl. In this way the movie works, especially when the kids go off on their chatter. There is a lot of 'GEE WHIZ!' 'THIS IS CRAZY GUYS!' 'DID YOU SEE THAT EXPLOSION!' fanfare that really is the heart of the movie and the best characterizations by the actors as they all run around doing their adventurous thing. It's fun hearing their interests and opinions popping up even in such cases when buildings are falling around them. So once again, though the story is fully fleshed out and makes sense in context to how its told, still yet the adult element is really unnecessary and distracts from the point.This movie will also probably be debated in terms of its choices LENSFLARE of reveal. People are already LENSFLARE rapidly falling into the, 'Should the monster be seen or shouldn't it?' debate, and actually I didn't mind the movie's LENSFLARE choice. In a way it is a different type of old school, a newer old school if you don't mind the contradiction. This movie LENSFLARE recalls Jurassic Park and early CGI feasts by LENSFLARE keeping things even when in plain view either in the distance or in the dark. Though we've gotten to the point LENSFLARE where South Korea has The Host and LENSFLARE Norway has Troll Hunter, proving that you needn't require even Hollywood production to make acceptable CGI, this movie plays that card safe and leaves the best parts LENSFLARE for actual emotional beats.In the end the movie is going to be summed up by a variety of people in the same way: a summer popcorn movie that embraces its popcornness. For some, that's exactly what they want from cinema and for others, they'll mean it in a bad way. I'm completely neutral on the matter so unfortunately my response to the film is rather mediocre. I enjoyed it and was glad that I saw it with friends, I especially enjoyed the crowd's reactions to it in the movie theatre as an 'event movie', and I couldn't really say there's any reason to see it again or own it on DVD or recommend it to anybody or anything. It's a good movie, I'm glad I saw it and it surprised me a little. Something tells me Spielberg's own Tintin is going to blow this out of the water.--PolarisDiB",6,1,3,17 June 2011
Up," As their techniques improve, they maintain the same level of quality
","Pixar's first venture into 3D is just about everything you would expect of it. Beautiful, gorgeous, colorful, and all that and a story too. A story full of lovable characters, adventure, and a gruff ol' fart. Everybody loves gruff ol' farts, especially those that have hearts.Some stand-outish things: 1) Whoa. Dog character dialog that sounds exactly like how you'd imagine dogs think.2) Whoa. Animated blood. Pixar truly pulls no punches.3) Whoa. One of the saddest cartoon deaths since Mustafa went down in Lion King.4) Whoa. What a tear-inducing ending! 5) Whoa. That scene when he looks through the adventure album again and discovers something new hit ya right in the heart.Make no doubt about it, whether I have kids or not I'm saving all Pixar productions to be watched over and over again. Nobody I think in the history of cinema has had such regular and trustworthy output, especially for movies that are aimed at children.There is one thing. As their animation has gotten more and more detailed, the character's faces have started looking more and more marshmallowy and plastic, devoid of quite the amount of detail put into, for instance, the millions of leaves in the background. This time you get to see Carl's face get all scrubbly and patchy as he doesn't shave for a few days, but the kid still looks like a plastic lollipop. I'm worried that, although they've gotten to an almost unthinkable level of detail in movement and environment, that Pixar isn't much interested in putting more dynamism into the faces, which still move roughly the same way they have for several years now. This type of thing wouldn't even be noticeable if it wasn't for the constantly improving level of all of the rest of their work. That said, like always, this is merely a nit to pick and not something that it ruinous or damaging to the fun and heart-filled Pixar experience. They are still, as far as I'm concerned, reigning kings of quality CG children's animation.--PolarisDiB",9,1,2,25 July 2009
The Fly," Master techno-horror piece
","If you're looking for a good mind blowing gory techno-horror, Cronenberg delivers with garnish and love. After the initial minute or two it takes to get over Jeff Goldblum's and Geena Davis' 80s style fashion and hair, 'The Fly' becomes a masterpiece of horror cinema.The story is actually very simple: Seth Brundle (Goldblum) invents a teleportation device, invites a reporter named Veronica (Davis) to share in the revelation, then, during a moment of weakness, tests the device on himself... accidentally fusing his genes with a wayward fly. Then he slowly falls apart while Veronica watches helplessly, also dealing with her own worries since she seems to be pregnant with Brundle's baby... and who knows how that'll turn out! Such a story is practically packaged in the 'this is supposed to be campy' production material, but Cronenberg doesn't do it like that. He plays it straight, and with Davis' and Goldberg's humanity, truly gets into the nature of this unique technological fear. But let's not wax too poetic: the movie delivers on a purely visual and visceral level. From Davis giving birth to a maggot to the prosthetics work as Goldblum's skin falls off his face, The Fly is a direct argument against the notion that it's always better to allude, not show, in horror cinema.This movie is absolutely delicious in a disgusting, rotten synthetic steak kind of way.--PolarisDiB",9,1,3,24 September 2007
The Wind that Shakes the Barley," Freedom, peace, conflict, violence, politics, love
","'The Wind that Shakes the Barley' is the latest Ken Loach film which analyzes the Irish War for Independence through the eyes of a young doctor and his brother, both who join the Irish Republican Army in order to fight for freedom and peace, but who eventually split ideologies to represent the conflict over what such things as freedom, peace, conflict, violence, politics, and love mean to society. Such concepts are in the air right now, but Loach seems to be sincerely inquisitive about them.This movie can easily be broken down into three parts. The first act uses violence and tension to create the exposition. The second act goes directly into the politics and dialog of the time. The third represents martyrdom and familial split. Of these parts, the third is the weakest, though but for the acting, which remains strong throughout. Cillian Murphy is a fantastic character actor who's gradually making himself known, and he's backed up by a stunning cast that doesn't do wrong.Loach also takes great pleasure in filming the countryside and the beauty that these characters live in. In many films such as these the idea is to show via the land what these characters are truly fighting for, and in this film it's particularly effective, also relating itself to the title (which is from a poem recited early in the film). A particularly ingenious use of landscape involves Damien and Sinead walking leisurely out of a heart-shaped copse that foreshadows their later relationship. Use of a love-interest in this case isn't maudlin, but done in a nicely understated way.--PolarisDiB",8,1,5,1 May 2007
"Salò, or the 120 Days of Sodom"," Mixed feelings about a strong statement
","First of all, this movie has more plot and more skillful development than most people tend to talk about, because most people tend to be struck by its hardest parts--which is the point. It's important when taking on a work like this that the intent isn't just to shock, but to shock for a reason, and that reason has to be backed up by a structural logic that Pasolini was obviously aware of.I didn't like it, but not because of how disturbing it was. I just think that fascists did enough real life evil that we hardly have use for such over-the-top 'allegories', as it were. On the other hand, if absolute power corrupts absolutely, it is interesting to see someone pointing out how that extends to joyless sexual deviency as well. So my feelings are mixed.I'm a general fan of what some call 'abject art' (a term I rather like and find very appropriate), which seeks to engage or compel an audience's negative reactions instead of positive ones. In the case of Salo, you are supposed to feel revulsion, not just intellectually, but physically, so that fascism and other forms of absolutist power is met in the audience with visceral revulsion, A Clockwork Orange style. Only nobody is holding your eyes open and there are no chemicals involved (unless you were the one to take them, at which case you've probably lost your mind by now and wouldn't be reading this), so in order to operate, Pasolini has to keep your attention and trigger your attention. I feel he successfully managed that for the most part, though to be perfectly honest, all those storytelling moments began to run into each other and drag.I also don't feel like all parts of the allegory were well developed. I understand that he intended for the cropophagia, for instance, to refer to fast food industries, but there was no other evidence that would lead to that association within the text--we have to turn to what Pasolini himself said about the movie in order to understand it, and that's not good film-making.Overall, the best aspect of it all told is the fact that somebody actually took a Marquis de Sade work and turned it into something just as loaded, just as controversial, and just as tasteless, unlike other de Sade adaptations (like Quills, which shows his life and parts of his work, but only the fun parts; or Lunacy, which mixes it with Edgar Allen Poe and Svankmajer's usual Gothic hilarity, making it all just fun absurdism and neglecting some of the straighter-faced harder-to-swallow bits).--PolarisDiB",6,2,3,7 July 2009
Some Like It Hot," Some issues I want to face...
","Okay, this movie is, indeed, very amazingly made. It's uproariously funny, pretty exciting, and has some very fine performances. Being a Wilder fan as well helps this movie quickly earn a bunch of big stars on the rating scale.However, I have always had a problem with this movie, and it wasn't until recently, my fifth time seeing it (yeah, it took that long), for me to realize what it was.I just don't believe Marylin Monroe's character.The thing is, she's so easily taken advantage of... and she admits it herself. However, her admitting it makes it okay. Sure, they sort of undercut it by making Lemmon's character actually finally tell the truth, but the fact remains that Sugar is ditzy, she's blond...she's everything a man wants, but for all the wrong reasons.Even the way Wilder puts the camera to her is very male-fantasy oriented. Think back, for a moment, to when she sings that one song, 'I wanna be loved by you/just you/nobody else but you.' She's singing at the camera, meaning she's looking directly at the audience members... presumably male, at least half-so.In fact a lot of this film could be considered prurient, but at this point I'd like to point out that so much of it is so playful, so light-hearted, that it doesn't really hold up that way. It's only with Sugar Kane herself that I begin to reject the notion that anything 'real' is happening, making it all seem vaguely false.Just a quick dampener before I go back to enjoying the rest of the performances.--PolarisDiB",7,0,7,23 February 2006
Inside Man," A fun charade, but ultimately no point
","It's hard to see why Spike Lee's films aren't more commercially viable on their own strength--the man has an eye for beauty and visual storytelling that makes his movies entertaining and enjoyable as much as they are important arguments about the world of ethnic unrest, which movies like Crash show are popular Hollywood fixtures anyway. However, for this reason or that, Lee is not typically considered a 'mainstream director', which is pretty much the biggest commercial curiosity this movie incorporates: Lee is making a joint that's a bank heist thriller?Well, yes, yes he is, and he's having it both ways. What is mostly a straight-forward genre piece is imbued with his floaty, detached camera, and ethnic profiling. The cops not only have to figure out a way to defuse a violent situation, but tensions underlying the community are getting in their way. Up to pretty much the ending, the movie is both a really great game of cat and mouse and a sober rumination on how cultural dysfunction can rise to the surface during some of the worst times.However, it all basically drops off at the end. After seeing this movie, I became a bit confused about what the point of all of it was supposed to be. At that point, any moralizing about crime or justice in this film drops off into emptiness or is deconstructed by Dalton's insistence that 'I am not a hero, and I am not doing this to provide a point.' No real purpose resides in Lee's focus on racial tension, either, besides the fact of his interest in it. We're made to believe that Washington's character is satisfied by the diamond he receives, but doesn't that go against the motivation of his character's direct and businesslike manner? A 'bad guy' not getting caught is an okay device, but for the purpose of some anti-heroic construction. This movie doesn't have that, it just has what is basically a sequence of events and then the letting go, or even purposeful forgetting, of them. So why tell the story in the first place? Of course, Lee's work is always somewhat ambiguous. Unfortunately, this time his ambiguity lacks real significance.Anyway, it's a pretty engaging and well-directed piece of work, it just ultimately leaves a lot to be desired. At least it provides proof that Lee can work quite well within the world of mainstream genre film-making, hopefully so that he can get funding for his more purposefully and significantly ambiguous works.--PolarisDiB",3,1,5,27 March 2008
Detroit Rock City," Silliness, Nostalgia, and kitsch (I mean, KISS...)
","This is a pretty decent coming-of-age, road-trip, dumb male friends, stoner, flashback to an era of kitsch movie. It's pretty simple: four teenage friends in a band want to go see KISS pretty much more than anything in the world, and they're pretty much willing to fight mothers, hall monitors, bullies, other metal heads, disco-lovers, and kindly church-going folk to do it, meanwhile employing such tactics as stripping, fighting, spiking pizza, getting girls, and sicking dogs to do it. The Joke, as it were, is that it's 1978, it's Ohio, and these young hooligans just want to smoke pot, get laid, and see their favorite band live for once in their lives.One thing that's kind of annoying about these nostalgia flicks is how focused characters that represent the generation are on a single influence. In this case, the plot revolves around KISS, and yet there's a certain level to which it really is questionable that these kids have nothing else to talk about. Except for in-jokes and a melange of era rock music, there's really not much world-building that gives this movie a particularly late-70s aura. Instead, it's pretty much a single punch-line: remember when KISS was cool and parents thought they were Satanic? Wasn't that funny? Yeah, yeah, it was.But still... you get to see Edward Furlong, pre-American History X, post-Terminator 2, throw up into a pitcher. You get to see a kid hold off an armed robber with a Stretch Armstrong. There's no end to silliness and laughs as long as you're willing to deal with mostly stupid characters and remember those glory days when you thought KISS was awesome, too (or, if you're like me and weren't around then, imagine it based on this movie's representation of it). Oh, and being from a place like Ohio helps. No, really.There are better movies with the same kind of humor out there, but that doesn't necessarily mean that this movie should be discarded. For what it's worth, at the moment it's in discount bins practically everywhere and can be acquired for some cheap entertainment with friends and beer pretty much whenever you want. I wouldn't necessarily pass it up if silliness, nostalgia, and KISS music is what you're into.--PolarisDiB",5,1,2,1 September 2008
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," Too bad they didn't have enough time to do it
","At this point, it doesn't matter how well filmed an adaptation it is, these movies are only going to come off like two-and-a-half-hour long commercials for the book.All the usual cast return for the very middle of the series, all in their robes and ready to say their lines and get out of the way of the camera for the next shot so that we can fit it all in. Several questions come to mind watching these young and intrepid kids trying their best to be their characters: What's gonna happen to these young stars after it's all over? Is Daniel Radcliffe disappointed that at this point he has no chance of learning how to act with ever shortening takes in which to deliver his lines? Will Rupert Grint ever be taken seriously after doing seven movies in a row about being a hero's buffoonish sidekick? What about that young man playing Draco Malfoy? He seems the type to become one of those typecast badguys that everyone loves to hate. At least that seems fun. Though I must say if I were Daniel Radcliff and company, I would totally rake in the cash I get from this endeavor and spend the rest of my life reading Dante, Milton, and Dostoyevsky without the translations.Really that's what was fun about this movie, watching it through the eyes of a talent scout and thinking, 'Where can all this talent go?' Sure, all of them do their jobs spectacularly. Too bad they didn't have enough time to do it. In fact, it wasn't until after the movie ended that I suddenly realized that I would have had no idea what was going on had I read the book. This movie fails to do some basic narrative things that create gaping plot holes: Uh, okay so yeah, Barty Crouch Jr. is a death eater and all. But, uh, where did he come from? How did he manage to do all of that? When did he capture Moody? Oops... all that work and the basic premise of the movie is completely disregarded.But it was fun. Ralph Fiennes makes a great Voldemort, even if he didn't have time to be truly evil. Instead he succeeds admirably at being creepy. Good stuff.This film is also important in that it reveals that pop music is just as terrible in fantasy worlds as it is in real ones. So much for escapism, eh? --PolarisDiB",5,0,0,25 March 2006
In Time," Topical and blunt but people are still talking about the concept for a reason.
","The concept intrigued me immediately, as Niccol's concepts tend to do, and by now it is clear that audiences on this one are going to be divided in those who love the idea and those too turned off by the heavy-handedness of the message. The concept is time is money--literally. The message is that the rich 1% gain immortality off of the very brief and stressful lives of hundreds of thousands of poor. It's hard to watch this movie without Occupy Wall Street in mind.Future generations removed from that context may have a lot more fun with it, in how the story is realized. Because it is in the way the characters think and deal with issues of time that this movie really flows, and Niccol handles it well. Phrases such as, 'Don't waste my time,' 'We don't have time to just stand around,' prostitutes: 'I'll give you ten minutes if you give me an hour,' waitresses, 'You're not from around here, you're in too much of a hurry'... even stock quotes from movies rendered with a whole new meaning--that's where a lot of the beauty of this movie is.Part of the issue is that Niccol didn't spend a whole lot of time on the type of background detail that would fill out an equivalent science fiction production like, say, _Soylent Green._ (I mean that pun about him not spending time, by the way. In places you can tell this movie's budget was spread really thin). Since there are no garbage men to pick up the bodies (say, for the pay of an hour per body), or traffic jam riots, or things like that, most of the realization of the concept of time is in the direct dialog and conflict of the characters. The dialog is a little audacious--in a way that's going to turn some audiences right off, whereas I think it was pretty wonderful, even in the places it got cheesy. There are a couple-few lines that are, however, completely groan-worthy: 'Do you even know HOW to drive?' (Chicka, homeboy's just been driving for the last half-scene or so, so yes). Expect lines like those as fodder for those who couldn't stomach the more political ham-fistedness of the film.Because, yeah, this movie is heavy-handed, in a way that is sort of disappointing considering Niccol's work on movies like Gattaca and The Truman Show. I think he gets kudos for embracing his concepts seriously, but could stand to work on his subtlety. So okay, Will's character and Weis' character are at opposing ends of the rich aristocrat social Darwinist/poor socially conscious hero dynamic. The two heroes are essentially Bonnie and Clyde in Logan's Run-land. That's fine. I think the biggest issue is that the 'system' described isn't filled out enough for us to know how it's supposed to break down, and that the situations like the 'Minutemen' and 'Timekeepers' being entirely self-aware of their complicity in the system does not fit a verisimilitude with the mafias and police officers they stand in for.Otherwise who cares? The movie still makes you think about things like whether the time you spend working is worth the time you gain from it, what the 'cost of living' really is, and if the increased danger of death is worth the time saved by speeding--common-day questions rendered strictly of essence in this movie, showcased by common idioms turned significantly important to daily lives.So all in all, good movie, potentially crippled by being a little too topical and a little less than subtle.--PolarisDiB",7,3,7,4 November 2011
Three Colors: Blue," Beautiful and colorful
","Kieslowski is one of those filmmakers whose framing, lighting, composition, and aspects of mise-en-scene basically bleed symbolism and interpretive meaning. This film is a virtual festival of light and color, though set under a rather murky tone... everything one comes to expect from this auteur.For me the experience was most engaging because of the way he seemed to use colors to denote different types of space: red for dramatic space, green for outside space, white for balanced space, and of course blue for personal or internal space. Not to say that this holds directly throughout; green is also around a lot during natural and life-giving moments and blue is used so much and in so many shades that it can mean a lot of different things. However, of the trilogy, this is the movie that most saturates the colors, spreading them over a bright canvas and making it impossible to ignore.It's also the most abstract, starting with a non-literal composition and finishing with a broken and open ending.It is, at any rate, very enticing and beautiful. It's one of those films that can take as much time as it likes and one doesn't begrudge the extra minutes staring at a person wrestling with internal thoughts.--PolarisDiB",10,0,1,3 August 2006
The Fountain," A Long Half-hour
","Being a fan of something creates both expectations and leniency. As a fan of Aronofsky, I had both high expectations and the willingness to let him take me wherever he chose to go. I wasn't disappointed, but of all of his films this seems the one least likely to be universally appreciated, mostly because it puts a lot on the viewer.Of course that means I love it. Anybody who's willing to let the audience figure the movie out for themselves has my appreciation because it's a lot more fun to observe. However, I think what really shows the power of this movie is that it feels like it's only a half an hour long... though probably one of the longest half hours you'll ever experience in cinema.Mixing Buddhist, Mayan, and Christian theologies surrounding creation myths and the Fountain of Life, Aronofsky shows a man searching for eternal life in three different times: Conquistador Spain, Modern America, and some unnamed, emotionally spent, seemingly post-apocalyptic future. Thomas's search for eternal life involves his love of Elizabeth (Izzy) who haunts him with her plea to 'Finish it'... the plea that anyone versed in theological implications of eternal life understand immediately. Eternal life involves the acceptance of death, and the drama here is Hugh Jackman's second obsessive character of the year learning to look past his own arbitrary existence.What makes this movie brilliant, to me, is the patterns. One of the difficult things about this movie is a huge saturation of overhead shots that feel distracting and needless, until one feels the pattern behind the movie. The movie is filled with patterns (even literally in the mise-en-scene, such as when Thomas looks at the wallpaper in the elevator or looks through the glass in the hospital), some that only reveal themselves in the third act. The overhead shots in the first act which seem so confusing are mirrored by the overhead shots in the third act which are visually amazing--the sweetest nectar for the eyes. If this movie has problems, it's that the first and second acts are entirely set-ups for the grand eloquence of the third act, a pretty difficult move to make and one that Aronofsky barely succeeded at. In this instance he could have toppled over, but he showed just enough reserve and foresight to hold the movie together with a strong emotional glue.Hugh Jackman helps with that glue. Hugh Jackman is one of the best mainstream actors out there, constantly rising in my opinion to greater achievements. The Prestige and The Fountain show what he's capable of, and I'm getting that contemporary directors are beginning to notice. We shall probably see some huge Oscar-centric role for him very soon.On the other hand, we have Rachel Weisz. Rachel Weisz is very photogenic, has amazingly perceptive eyes, and is a terrible actress. She works best when she's not delivering or intoning, and unfortunately as the love interest of Thomas she gets a bit more close-up than she can handle. I think if anything ruins this movie, it's Weisz's acting. Her modern character, Izzy, was unfortunately the weakest written, and adding the weakest acting to it made it a little difficult to get through.ON the other hand, one of the things Aronofsky seems much more interested in this case is the science fiction elements that tie everything together (and create one of the most breathtakingly visual cine-paintings I've ever seen). While the first act feels confusing and the second act can get a bit melodramatic, the sudden rending of space and time into a complete organism makes the third act change EVERYTHING. Suddenly all the difficulties with the movie disappeared. All of the patterns emerged, and the long plodding story suddenly shrinks to a half an hour in length. If a film has ever created time travel in the audience, it is this one.The themes and story I leave for other people to appreciate. The visuals and construction of the narrative are why I stress that people should see this movie.--PolarisDiB",8,3,8,27 November 2006
Rosemary's Baby," A devil of a good time
","Honestly, one cannot ask more from a horror movie. Sans any special effects, it's all up to the story, acting, and directing to pull it all off, and they all work perfectly together to appropriate the correct mood.Rosemary Woodhouse and her husband, an aspiring actor, move into a new apartment to start their future off... the apartment is near to where the husband must go to get work, and it's big enough that they may have room for children. Their initial excitement eventually leads to her becoming impregnated, though under suspicious circumstance. Eventually the pregnancy becomes less than welcome as physical pain and continually untrustworthiness of surrounding people start hemming Rosemary in...just as she begins to feel they are plotting against her baby.Roman Polanski said of the book, 'At first I thought it was a soap opera, and then I found myself reading it at four in the morning with my eyes burning.' So the directing goes. Mia Farrow's acting is of young innocence that seems rather childish in some parts, but profoundly adult in others: she is a young woman with hopes and dreams and worst of all, fears. Rosemary's concern is never for herself, even as she discovers the plot against her; it's for her child.Better, the audience is never really sure she's not insane. As the plot thickens away from cheery city life towards claustrophobic fear of entrapment, even as we sympathize with Rosemary her angst, her outward worry is not sympathetic to a world where everyone acts as if all is normal. For all we know, nothing could be wrong at all.Then we find ourselves at the end, the coup de grace of horror movie design, where she makes a decision that is sure to shock even the most blase of viewers.The cinematography in this film is amazing. At one point she's looking at a clock and it seems to warp in space and grow further away from her, fitting her insecurity expressionistically perfectly. Simple things like doorways are shown as if there's no mystery behind them at all, yet as they are opened they become foreboding.For horror fans, there is little better.--PolarisDiB",10,8,13,15 October 2005
There Will Be Blood," There will be even more rave reviews, but for the meantime here's yet another one.
","Released to immediate critical and audience acclaim, There Will Be Blood has quickly affixed itself to be the film of the year. Viewing this movie leaves no doubt in my mind that it will pretty much sweep the Oscars (though I prefer No Country for Old Men, There Will Be Blood has some of those key topics that Hollywood just lo-o-oves to care about), and personal feelings aside it certainly deserves it. In fact, running as it is alongside such fare as Cloverfield, it's nice to actually have an event movie that's worth something, much less so dramatically compelling.Now, Daniel Day-Lewis is the star and, as pretty much every review of this movie in the world mentions, eats up his role and picks his teeth gleefully afterward. But there are other people in this movie, too, and they are likewise amazing. Paul Dano plays Eli Sunday, a priest who at first sets contrast to Plainview's greed, but who eventually comes to become Day-Lewis' strongest doppelganger (in a weird way), and major props should be given to him for his role. Sunday's somewhat caricature aspect (he's pretty much the forerunner of a televangelist) can be controversial for what it says about religion, but of course Anderson writes and directs with more subtlety than that, and the brilliance of There Will Be Blood is not only the fascination behind the character of Daniel Plainview, but the equal-and-opposite (but not quite really opposite if you think about it) character of Eli Sunday. Even keeping in mind that a) Upton Sinclair was a raging muckraker who wrote books pretty much to condemn his characters, and b) current sympathies are very cynical and touchy around subjects of oil barons and priests, Plainview and Sunday come across as some of the strongest characters written for the screen in decades.And, of course, what review of excellence would this be without mentioning the skill of PT Anderson? Sure, he's mostly known for his assembly dramas, which is somewhat unfair because Magnolia and Boogie Nights are only 2 of his 5 widely-released movies. A lot of people are talking about There Will Be Blood as surprising because Anderson was capable of focusing so much attention and detail to a single character. If those people had paid more attention to Magnolia and Boogie Nights, they'd notice that their success depends upon him being able to attend and express characters fully with as much detail as possible. This is why I think other assembly dramas such as Crash and 21 Grams, no matter how popular, still suck. PT Anderson is an almost old-school director: one whose attention to detail goes over every aspect of the character's presentation from the actor as much as it's singularly aware of everything that is going on visually. Yes, the Anderson long take is featured in There Will Be Blood. Often, in fact! And yes, they're amazing takes in the way that they block and choreograph imagery, as well as create dramatic tension, while not calling much attention to the fact that they are single takes except to people like me who tend to ruin my own movie experiences to paying wayyy too much attention to that.I do think the ending was slightly a let down not because of the actions that took place, but because the mood changed a lot and suddenly the movie was comedic. However, I can't think of a better way to end it myself, so who am I to speak on the matter? At any rate, this movie is great, and hopefully if you're not convinced to see it by all the other millions of rave reviews from people even more and even less technically credible than me, then this review may put even more weight onto the 'Oh, I might need to see this, and soon,' side of the scale.--PolarisDiB",8,1,8,26 January 2008
Army of Darkness," Somewhere in between....
","Some movies are good, some are bad. Some movies are so bad they're good. Because of this, some people try to make some movies that are so bad they're good. If you try to fail and do so, have you succeeded? Well we don't have to ask that question with this movie, because it's not bad enough to be bad or good, and it's really not good. Thus we conclude it's a mediocre attempt at being so bad it's good.Our hero the brazen braggart Ash goes back in time, where he is the Chosen One who will defeat the Army of Darkness...provided he can remember a few simple syllables. That's really it as far as the plot goes, along with the whole deal with Evil Ash the doppelganger leading the Army of Darkness. For some reason, it sounds better on paper, and it really shouldn't have.That said, this movie still has it's tongue-in-cheek charm. Ash's lines are made-for cult favorites, and the action is wonderfully banal. One of the strongest parts of the movie has to do with its pacing, how development is discarded to just get the action moving from scene to scene. For instance, the wise man continuing nonchalantly with his speech after Ash dispatches of a Deadite that interrupts them.It is quite definitely a fun, good time not meant to be taken seriously, more fun especially with friends and a good crowd.--PolarisDiB",6,3,8,30 October 2005
Stranger Than Fiction," Actually quite superb
","I had heard a lot of good things about this movie, but was unsure if I wanted to see it as I haven't liked anything done by Will Ferrell so far (and yes, I've seen parts of 'Elf'). Deciding to let that X-factor slide, I went ahead and checked it out based on some of the reviews I heard.Turns out Will Ferrell wasn't only good, he was brilliant and perfect for the role. His usual sarcastic-saturated loudness was replaced by a reserve and quietness that created a Harold Click absolutely perfectly around the narration.Stranger than Fiction is a movie about a boring, lifeless IRS auditor who one day gets distracted from his daily routine of counting brush strokes on his teeth by a woman narrating his life. This oddity eventually turns out to be only one of his problems as his life suddenly starts changing one-by-one: he meets a woman he falls almost instantly for, his watch starts making fits, and the professor of literature he goes to see for advice can't seem to decide if he's in a comedy or a tragedy. Not only that, but the narrator told him he is going to die soon.This movie is hilarious and pretty well written (minus perhaps the cliché Stiff-Neck-Falls-In-Love-With-Free-Spirited-Woman subplot and the underdevelopment of Queen Latifah's character, who is surprisingly good in her role as well), which is probably one of the reasons why everyone does so well in it. Amazing what a good script and some decent directing will do to turn an annoying comedian into an actor.I was slightly curious about the ending. I actually secretly hoped he'd die just to see if the filmmakers would be gutsy enough to kill him. However, the ending it has is actually very appropriate and perfect.This movie does pose an interesting questions, and NOT the 'if you knew you had a short time to live' one. As a writer or storyteller, are you responsible for your characters' deaths? How important is a great work of literature over somebody's life? How close can you really get to your characters before you can't bear to see them go? --PolarisDiB",8,0,0,28 February 2007
The Wrestler," Heart and humanity from the director who has yet to do wrong
","Darren Aronofsky has largely made a career of putting his audience into the POV of his topics, from the migraine-induced paranoia of pi to the draining addiction of Requiem for a Dream to the spiritual fascination of The Fountain and now, to the momentum-fueled downfall of The Wrestler. Ten minutes into this film and I knew here was a film destined, yet again, to be underrated. Critics are praising Mickey Rourke's performance right and left, but Aronofsky is a risk-taking director and doesn't exactly play it easy here. Most of this movie is an over-the-shoulder perspective of Rourke's shambling form, and though most critics will probably interpret this as aiming for a pseudo-documentary effect, I hope the introspective nature of it isn't lost on too many people--here, the audience is made to feel the hulking weight of The Ram's form as their own body, with his stuttered breathing and pained lip-smacking creating austere ambiance.Once again Aronofsky shows off his acumen both in the stylistic directing of the movie itself plus with an intelligent and sincere screenplay. Some high-notes of the genre are hit, from the estranged daughter to the heart-of-gold stripper to minor drug use, but none of it comes off as sentimental and this is definitely not Rocky whatever-number-we're-on. Aronofsky is interested mostly in showing people who've lost the one thing that gives them talent (their body) slowly destruct their minds. The flag-waving spectatorship cues weirdly inherent in most movies is kept to the background, but the blue-collar sensibility is held dear and given more room and, frankly, more humanity and reality than just taking it for granted. Of all of Aronofsky's works, this is one with a specific voice, and Rourke inhabits that voice so well that I do have to agree with the lauding critics and mention that Mickey Rourke deserves an Oscar for this role.Meanwhile, it's emotionally devastating, but this time with an endearing humanism that makes it a lot easier to stomach than Requiem for a Dream. The problem getting people's interest in Aronofsky is that he doesn't play easy with his audience, and as a highly idiosyncratic director, is very hard to introduce. Finally he's come up with a movie that it seems almost anybody can really enjoy and appreciate, except for the problem that people just simply don't like movies that stay on the back of characters' heads (the same unfair criticism got shoved on Punch Drunk Love) and are willing to be as blunt as this. Nonetheless, this movie is amazingly crafty and endearing. I recommend it heartily.--PolarisDiB",10,2,4,18 January 2009
Inception," Just try to go to sleep
","People love to talk about the relationship between cinema and dreams. As a slightly surreal artform in and of itself, directors and artists have always tweaked with the filmic space of perception to achieve dream or dream-like effects. The problem I typically find in almost all movies attempting to recreate dreams is that they do so in too literal a way, often drawing attention to the dream effect they are portraying. This becomes even more difficult to pull off in movies that question the line between dreams and reality (a much more obvious line than pop philosophy ever really acknowledges) pretty much have to point out the dream techniques of the production you are watching. This is Nolan's central dilemma, and one he doesn't really manage to transcend. As a visual invention in technical prestidigitation, this movie is successful, but it is too bogged down by exposition to really let its dream-scapes breathe.Really, this movie is closer to The Matrix than Paprika, a Satoshi Kon animated movie I expected it to be closer to. A core group of technopirates get into people's dreams to steal information, but now they are a challenged by a corporate agent to actually plant an idea in the head of a target instead of steal the idea. This process is called inception. Now Nolan goes the correct route and centers the action around the head of the dream stalkers, Cobb, played by Leonardo DiCaprio. Seems Cobb has some mental juju to work out that keeps 'projecting' into the missions he undertakes (Nolan misses the point of Freudian 'projection', but hits a cute pun on the very medium we are watching). So as these mercenaries of the subconscious get ready for their mission, it is complicated by the fact that their intrepid leader at any point can cause phantasmic chaos. Enter a few rules about dying and waking up, losing your mind and creating mental labyrinths, and you basically have the movie's own architecture for what ultimately, when it comes down to it, past all the rhetoric and screen wizardry, becomes a series of set-pieces.Nolan creates a world where this technology exists, and sets the rules of the technology. He then adds the element that in a world where that technology exists, rich people like Cobb's target would have defenses set up. These defenses translate into literal nobody adversaries for whiz bang action. In order that death seem actually like a bad thing (beyond just waking up), he sets Limbo. Then the movie goes, losing track of what is essentially at the core of everything the audience cares about--Cobb's inception, and the working through the guilt he has. I guess ultimately Nolan didn't want to remake Shutter Island. I'm not sure DiCaprio really felt a huge difference between either role.So we're not in legitimate dream world here. The characters are too aware, the dreamy twists on reality are pointed out and explained via direct real-world correlations, the subconscious is generally predictable and follows ineffectual actions from barely described motivations, and in order to get there Nolan has to cram way too much exposition into the first twenty minutes, instead of dwell on the central drama of the entire movie, Cobb and his wife. That's fine because then we're in Nolan's world, not dream world, and he can make any rules he wants. So he does, and you get... you know.... chase sequences, Siberian battles, explosions. If Nolan is expressing anything in his subconscious here, it's that he deeply regrets not having an opportunity yet to direct a James Bond movie.However it's not all that bad. The story of Cobb, the creation of the labyrinths, the technical beauty of it all is engaging science fiction cinema. The only root problem is Nolan's asking of the somewhat clichÃ©d albeit age old question, 'What is the difference between dreams and reality?' Because no filmmaker who brings up this question never answers that question definitively, audiences shouldn't expect for it to be here. However, Nolan does miss one definite thing about dreams that does not work in his scenario.In Inception, Cobb and his wife live, and age, for years in a dream world of their own creation. Later, his wife cannot tell if them waking up came to another level of dream, or if they finally achieved reality. I would just point out the obvious: In dreams, you never go to sleep. You may wake up, but even in Inception, going to sleep within sleep requires an apparatus.Problem solved.--PolarisDiB",6,19,38,16 July 2010
Platoon," Necessary as opposed to gratuitous.
","When I first saw this, I felt pretty disappointed in how a sense of the glory of war still seemed to have slipped its way into the mix through the character of Elias, played by Willem Dafoe. Somehow Dafoe's moralistic inner-strength and the way he can run into combat to kick butt without any support because, 'Other people just slow me down,' seemed incongruous with the overarching point of intensifying the destructive feelings of fear, stress, and anger felt during combat.However, regarding Elias as a symbol of what the innocent people like Chris wanted to believe came out of war helps to reinforce the theme stated at the end of the movie: 'We are in war against ourselves and our enemies are really within us.' Sergeant Barnes' (Berenger) hidden execution of Elias shows the ultimate destruction of that romantic heroism from within rather than without.It is from that point that the high levels of violence, bodies ripping apart, disturbing fights, and harrowing warfare surrounds itself to become more than just voyeuristic appraisal of the Vietnam War. Much has been said about Oliver Stone's involvement in the war and how this movie was created of his experiences, but I think it's important to point out that Stone's writing and directing is strong enough that his reputation as a veteran is not the only excuse for the disturbing and disgusting images of a film that has upon second-thought no inspection, but contains itself admirably as a parable for the state of American politics at the time. Sure his use of an almost all-black cast for Sgt. Elias' half of the troop and all-white cast (a good few with strong 'hick' accents) for Sgt. Bob's half is a bit heavy-handed, but the point is still solid.This is also probably a really good film to watch just to cast light on a lot of what happens in Stone's other films. Ultimately this is the only Stone film I've seen so far that I've felt comfortable calling a 'Stone film' because of his strong and specific approach to it. Nothing in this seems as gratuitously extreme, only necessarily extreme.--PolarisDiB",10,2,4,26 June 2006
Halloween," A classic
","'Halloween' is, of course, a very famous horror film, and is well-liked today even though 1) modern audiences are being fed more extreme fare and 2) it contains some of those absurd types of reasoning that have become well-recognized and endlessly parodied. Part of the reason why is the sense that it's a classic... it's been around a while, has had many sequels to keep its name around, and was indeed shocking at the time. Another reason is that it was one of the films to usher in those now-recognized clichés, having come after Texas Chainsaw Massacre but before Friday the 13th, Nightmare on Elm Street, and the Hellraiser series. It also still has a subsisting sense of creepiness merely for the fact that the Michael Myers never talks, and he never reveals himself... lending the movie a surreal sense that is constantly pounded upon by Donald Pleasance's Dr. Loomis: 'Behind those eyes is nothing but pure evil.' 'Halloween' also came after 'Jaws', which helped because it was one of the beginning of an era where studios were hoping to make blockbusters out of the teen demographic. John Carpenter's approach to voyeurism in this film, though Hitchcock-inspired, was serendipitous for keeping it to the demographic, and 'Halloween' stands as a classic narrative about the deaths of the sexualized and the survival of the virginal. Michael's initial slaughter of his sister is completely unexplained (except by those comfortable with the 'Eh, he was insane, what can you say?' explanation) except by the extremely sexual nature of the opening take. While such a theme and approach had been used before, we can thank Carpenter for ultimately suturing it onto popular conscious.Finally, the 'Halloween' theme song is something of a famous work in and of itself. Carpenter wrote the score himself, as he did many of the synthetic sound effects, but while the latter seem dated, the former still has a resounding feeling of suspense. So effective is it that it marked every Halloween sequel as part of the franchise right from the commercials onward, and it's being upheld by Rob Zombie in his remake despite the fact that Zombie is a musician himself.Also, an interesting fun fact: in this movie, Carpenter homages 'The Thing', which he later remade. From this movie Rob Zombie used clips of the children nagging Tommy about the Boogeyman for the White Zombie song 'Boogeyman', and later Rob Zombie remade 'Halloween'.--PolarisDiB",7,6,7,30 April 2007
Iron Man," Comic book movie for fun's sake
","The two superheroes of the summer seem to be rich, intelligent inventors with high tech whimsy, consummate attractiveness, and a bug up their ass for truth, justice, and the American Way. Iron Man and The Dark Knight are like the same story told with completely different motivations and through completely different means. And after the rash of 'serious' comic book movies out there, it's very nice to see one that manages to be bad-ass without just being dumb. Iron Man is that movie.No 'I'm an alienated superhero with feelings' here, folks, Tony Stark is a contrary jerk and he knows it. He also doesn't care, doesn't have to care, and relishes not caring, which is why once he finds something to actually care about, that is, making sure that the technology he developed changes it's nature from weapon to tool, it's without a second guess or any real desire to be quiet and indiscreet about it. This is a nice refreshment after the last couple of years, where even cheery and almost always dependably sappy Superman has to become an emo kid in order to make serious comic book fans wet. Taking some of the riffs of Ozzy's 'Iron Man' and turning them into a decent metal score, 'Iron Man' the movie is mostly concerned with showcasing the awesomeness of a man who has the ability, the means, and especially, the cash to kick butt on his own motivation. No long discussions about the nature of vigilantism, no fear of keeping a secret identity, no real basic questions except, 'How do I get those thrusters to work without killing myself? I want to fly.' I'm not intending to use this review to give The Dark Knight a short shrift, but where Dark Knight finally succeeded at making a realistic, emotionally felt comic book movie that people have been aspiring to ever since X-men showed it was possible, Iron Man significantly shows that you can have superheroes just be superheroes, which has gotten a little lost in the grind (and the few cases where people have tried making a mindless superhero movie in the past few years have succeeded at making them quite mindless). Stark has weaknesses, he has doubts, but damn it, he also never slows down to think about them. It's about time something like this came back.That said, in the case of Iron Man 2? Eh, probably not gonna be all that great.--PolarisDiB",8,1,2,4 August 2008
Mother!," Allegorical Descent into Anger
","Expectations and frame of mind matter, and based off people's reactions, I came into Mother! expecting something like my experience with Knight of Cups -- a visually arresting and self-involved film that I was mostly just glad managed to get produced in this Age of Marvel, but otherwise didn't care for and wouldn't need to see again. I did not go in expecting to 'like' this movie so much as respect it.Instead, I loved it. I enjoyed almost every minute of it. It's pretty much the sort of experience I look to cinema for, and the sort of experiences that are the reason I'm into film in the first place. If movies like this didn't exist, I would mostly stick to other media.I think there are legitimate criticisms of this movie -- I personally didn't like the ending, largely coming from a place that I disagree with Aronofsky's beliefs in a cyclical universe (that he showcases in The Fountain and Pi as well, so I know it's his thing). But that disagreement comes from the statements he was making, rather than the fact that he was wrong to attempt to make them.As for what that statement is, if it isn't clear earlier, it's transparent by the time the frog bounces out from the blood-dripping wall that we're in allegory logic, the space where characters are types of energy and cause-effect is metaphysical as opposed to any sort of Newtonian rules-based system. The topic of that allegory is about as much about motherhood as Finnegans Wake is about a funeral; it's a reworking of the Bible the way Finnegans Wake is a reworking of Genesis; it's a rip-off of Rosemary's Baby the way Finnegans Wake is a rip-off of Tristan and Isolde; and it's a criticism on the egoism of fame the way Finnegans Wake is a criticism of alcoholism. Let this statement not stand as a comparison of QUALITY -- Finnegans Wake is incomparably better a work than Mother! -- but I use the analogy because too many negative reviews of this affix their criticism to only one track with complete dismissal of the others. But the whole is larger than the parts.Where you go from there is a largely angry, exasperated, and fearful mood piece about the self-destructive and bestial behavior of human beings, with a question mark as large as the titles exclamation point about why God lets all that happen, and finally a bittersweet and sort of hopeful / cynical exhaustion over the idea that it all renews to happen all over again. Take from that what you will and experience the rest for yourself.As for entertainment value, after decades of engaging on the subjects of tastes, entertainment, and escapism, I've learned I'm more at a loss than anything at understanding why brain-splodey headshots, squiddy toilet monsters, and cult rave raid battles fail the spectacle any more than space wizards, superheroes, and murderous clowns. I enjoyed just watching the movie, I didn't have to analyze it to fill the time of experiencing it. I have nothing I can offer there but vague platitudes about the unaccountability of taste and something about target audiences. If it's not your thing, I know I'm not going to convince you.But there are two arguments against this movie that are invalid.People are complaining that Mother! is too 'stylized.' Mother!'s camera is a forced perspective -- just to the side of POV (of which there are a few key shots punctuated about), the visuals of the movie reside entirely in the peripheral vision of the main the character. This isn't too stylized, this is something ONLY CINEMA CAN DO. You don't get that uncanny feeling of something just out of your vision in any continual protracted sense from any other medium. If that's forbidden from cinema based on your arbitrary rules of 'style', then cinema ceases to have anything interesting going for it. One reviewer who liked it quite a bit mentioned 'It makes you desperate for a wide shot'. Who else felt desperation? The main character.People are complaining that Darren Aronofsky is pretentious. If only more directors were pretentious, so that we'd get these visceral experiences that sent the audience I was sitting with (sold out show, post-bad reviews and flopping news) cringing, gasping, groaning, gagging, and eventually tumbling out onto the street talking about it -- love it or hate it.Pretentious is a movie designed only to sell toys claiming some universal meaning because it follows the beats prescribed by Joseph Campbell without reading the book to learn that the format is only the capsule -- meaning is the capsule's filler. Stylized is a movie throwing three layers of lens flare and grading firmly orange teal to avoid laying bare the overcoverage that allows the producers to undercut the director and DoP. Mother! was a movie made by a person's decision to risk it with a personal voice. I'd rather watch movies with a voice I hate than a movie lacking voice at all.",10,5,15,27 September 2017
Blade Runner," Humanity and God
","Three genres are traced back to Expressionism: film noir, science fiction, and horror. All three are represented to some effect (well, maybe not so much horror, though a few moments are spine-tingling) to create the dirty, sulky atmosphere of 2019 Los Angeles, where the rich have gone to live on the off-world colonies and the rest of humanity bubbles and ferments in a disgusting world of industrial sludge and ever-pouring rain, a world now penetrated by four replicants (androids) escaped from the off-world colonies and who must be hunted down by Deckard, a blade runner.Such is the overview of the richly articulated and darkly felt exploration into humanity and creation, where humans have created humans and those humans are aggressors against their creators. Man, beast, and robot are mixed and only divided by social taboos and product numbers, only that doesn't necessarily make the humans much different either considering how literally crushed they are by industry and advertising ever flashing through the streets in neon signs.The story arch follows Deckard as he is forced unwillingly into hunting down the escaped replicants and slowly finds all roles reversed, both of the hunt and of the status. As he falls in love with the replicant Rachel, Deckard is forced to hide her from the very people he works for just as much as he's forced to pass their judgement on people whose only crime is the desire to live. Such poetic exposition is not realized through the human characters; their actions are too mechanic and bland that they nearly seem invisible. It's realized in the replicants, who desire, love, feel, and hurt.This is an awesome and powerful look into what it means to be human and God. Both the stylistic elements and the craftsmanship of this film work together perfectly to create an atmosphere often attempted but never as fully realized in this distinct and important film. It's a must for all lovers of cinema to experience at least once, and hopefully see again and again and again.--PolarisDiB",10,1,3,25 October 2005
Toy Story 3," We've faced replacement and we've faced neglect--now on to death
","This is now officially one of the most qualitative franchises I can think of, and a Toy Story 4 of even half the quality would send this right to the top past the Alien Quadrilogy. The storytelling is brisk, the animation is beautiful, the scenes range from funny to disturbing to terrifying to heartwarming to outright tear-inducing. The garbage combustion scene alone is bound to give children nightmares, but Buzz bustin' out the flamenco is more than enough to keep this one fun for the whole family. What I like best is that they manage to keep to the spirit, look, and characters of the other movies while still amping up showmanship and surprises, storytelling and subthemes.That said, this movie follows the same essentail formula as Toy Story 2, including having a roughly similar turn-out for the villain of the picture, and the ending pretty much sets us back at point one so that this can just continue on and on. These movies are, essentially, all about limited time and limited life, these characters all know one day the end will come, but of course the audience knows that it won't, at least during the movie that they're watching. So even though I trust Pixar enough to go to see Toy Story 4, if it ever exists, right here would be a very good place to end. After all, the first is about surviving replacement, the second about surviving aging, and the third about surviving the afterlife (I would say that the daycare center stands in for Purgatory and, well, the inferno for Inferno quite well), so any more existential worries about the end of the toys given time would probably be repetitive--best to start thinking about other adventures they could possibly go on, or settling on the score while it's still high.--PolarisDiB",10,4,5,9 July 2010
Trainspotting," Fun depravity
","Cinema has had its fair share of morally questionable heroes, but Ewan McGregor's character is probably the most fun we've ever seen. What do we take from a guy who feels very despicable about sleeping with a minor yet steals money from his friends because, 'Well, the truth is I'm a bad person?' We get an interesting character, that's what. One surrounded by references to other nonconformist or antiheroic characters of visual past... the Beatles' Abbey Road cover, a bar set to look (somewhat obviously) like the milk bar from Clockwork Orange, the amusingly cheeky art of Andy Warhol... all to provide a background for a guy who takes drugs, quits, steals, and each time does it with different results and to different levels and with no really strict 3/5 act story design.This is a movie that simultaneously has a very disturbing death and a very cute one. It's a movie that has winners and losers, though we're never fully sure which are which. It has a guy who hates junkies and spends all of his free time befriending them, that flippantly rejects mainstream ideas of life and material happiness but chooses to end that way, and gets blamed for glorifying drugs while still containing scenes creepy enough to make anybody swear of junk forever... like they do a hundred times...What more could you ask for? Well, I guess it's worth noting that this is done by the same guy who's done 28 Days Later... and Millions. Everyone already knows that, but come on... Danny Boyle definitely has something going for him, and I think he still has a lot more to offer us. I personally can't wait.--PolarisDiB",9,0,0,8 April 2006
Fantastic Mr. Fox," Anderson World realized to its utter fantasia pinnacle.
","It is said that animation is the most pure way of controlling every element of a movie production, and nowhere is this proved more than in Wes Anderson's The Fantastic Mr. Fox. Viewers familiar with Wes Anderson's world (a self-defined and hermetically closed off alternate reality that remains consistent with each passing movie) are going to find themselves right at home--so much so that it's almost impossible to watch the film as anything other than warm homages to his own emotional topography. Quite literally: story? What story? We're in Wes Anderson Land, where the characters are quirky and the humor is almost always understated.George Clooney plays Mr. Fox and Meryl Streep Bill Murray Jason Schwartzmann Willem Dafoe Owen Wilson is blah blah blah. You recognize the voices and you especially recognize them from previous Anderson films. The music. Warm-hearted childhood narration with darker undertones. Okay now that we've gotten the basics covered, what's new? THE ANIMATION! Holy cuss but it's pretty! It has the same movement and feeling of the Brothers Quay and Jan Svankmajer, without, you know, the utter disturbing darkness and phantasmagoric splendor. Anderson always loves blocking his shots, as in not only deciding how the action should be blocked but literally putting everything on lateral rectilinear spaces, and the childhood shoe-box diorama feel of this thing is absolutely perfect for his vision. The movement only gets weird when the action gets fast, but otherwise it is hard not to get utterly involved with every little detail of this make-shift fantasia. This movie is at its best in close-up; people who get put off by the uncanny nature of stuffed animal eyes should probably stay home, everyone else will be drawn into them.Is it fair to discuss this movie solely as an Anderson production without taking into account the demographic it is promoted to? Well unfortunately, I'm not reading much of a positive reaction in kids. I went to see this with my friend because she was babysitting a four and a half year old and neither he nor the children of his general age-group seemed very impressed by the goings-on. Certainly I wouldn't argue that every kid who sees this was or will be turned off by it, but the audience appreciation seemed to come from the adults more in response to the detail and how the movie was made over the story and the characters. The story itself is pretty basic, and the funniest lines of dialog seem to fly right over kids' heads. Like what was expected of Where the Wild Things Are, The Fantastic Mr. Fox is really a nostalgic homage for the 20-30 something crowd, but unlike Where the Wild Things Are it didn't actually end up being a cerebral rumination on childhood, playing instead to Anderson's greatest strength: mop-headed hipsters unapologetic about their inner child and ready to watch some Roald Dahl accompanied by the Beach Boys. Of which, luckily, I am a member, which means the movie made no beef with me.--PolarisDiB",7,1,3,14 January 2010
Live Free or Die Hard," Worth what I paid...
","Caught this in a second-run feature for $1.25. It was worth EXACTLY that. The concept is ludicrous: Bruce Willis against a group of angry computer nerds. Not exactly 'Freddy Vs Jason' or 'Alien Vs Predator' there, now is it? Complaints involve the fact that most of the dialog sounds literally cut-and-paste from other action flicks, the opening scene is a testament to unbelievable acting and characters, and that several of the actors' deliveries and characters in this movie were so interchangeable that if I directed it, I'd've made the actors trade roles between scenes as a joke. However, I went there to see Bruce Willis blow stuff up, and 100% of this movie's creativity was put into just that. So I'm not gonna complain about paying to see it.--PolarisDiB",4,1,5,23 August 2007
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2," Illustrative
","There's this superstition about Star Trek movies that all the even numbered ones are good and all the odd numbered ones are bad. By the Harry Potter movie adaptation reckoning, it seems to be just the opposite: the odd numbered movies were spiffy and the even numbered movies were dull. However, the fact that the first adaptation didn't work out too well off-sets that and splitting '7' into '7.1' and '7.2' seemed to create a curious result: that of the fact that 7.1 was almost spot-on and 7.2 almost completely (save a few good moments) dropped the ball.David Yates has been one of the best Harry Potter directors (probably why the longest running) because of his closer attention to the characters and mood than just reciting plot points (Columbus and Newell) and focusing on the magic (Cuaron). Here it doesn't work. Previously, David Yates went the daring route of allowing the camping scenes to draw out the way they work in the book, focusing on the character's loss of direction and even boredom in a high stress environment as tension is building. This approach is unpopular in filmmaking because audiences don't like watching characters be impatient and bored--it makes them impatient and bored as well, and 7.1 had its critics for that. It seemed with all the careful mood-building Yates was doing, 7.2 was going to be the release we were all looking for in an ending: the tension explodes and the threads close....and though 7.2 certainly had its action, Yates managed to make the movie both slow... and rushed. For once his devoted focus to Harry Potter's mental working doesn't work out, because while we're sitting with Radcliffe in a room somewhere as he decides what to do next, information is getting straight skipped over in the Battle of Hogwarts going on outside. People've not read the book seem to all be reacting with confusion and require too much explanation from the audiences that have read the book as to what's going on. Deaths happen off-screen and are only mentioned in single lines of dialog, despite being important to both plot and often audience. The Snape's Story flashback scene is cut near to a third of the detail, but the limbo scene seemed protracted for no reason at all. The Battle of Hogwarts covers a good 80% of the playlength of the movie, but the actual action of that battle is regulated transition scenes where the characters have to run through it to get somewhere else--AND is shown more as crowded hallways with extras running wildly instead of showing the important elements of the battle regarding which characters end up fighting whom.It's difficult because the movie stretches at over two hours in length and should not be much longer. But Yates seems to have forgotten Griffith-old well-established cross-cutting. Compare to Star Wars Episode 6. Star Wars balances three entire battles with their respective character beats while Harry Potter 7.2 cannot even balance one battle with Harry's personal discoveries. Star Wars Episode 6 may have annoyed fans with cutesy teddy bears but Harry Potter 7.2 annoys them major plot points being dismissed entirely. All one needed was some cross-cutting between, say, the Room of Requirement and the people in the entrance way of Hogwarts, but instead of showing WHY Mrs. Weasley was so protective of her daughter to inspire what was supposed to be an epic line, the camera lingers longer on stone soldiers fighting giants.The split-up of book seven was intended to fit the amount of information in that book into a longer play-length, as well as increase the amount of tickets sold, but it feels like 7.1 was the movie that Yates wanted to make, and 7.2 was just him trying to shove some denouement in around studio-requested 3D shots. There is a lot of room for improvement but there isn't a whole heck of a lot that can be done now. So now its time to sum up the series.Whereas its taken as a general rule that the books are better than the movie, a good adaptation can stand on its own and deliver the story to a new audience. Lord of the Rings is a good example of this, creating a pretty consistent movie narrative that most audiences can keep up with and enjoy despite deviations from the books. Harry Potter from the get-go was too focused on enfranchisement that it took quite a few entries before it gained its legs--and by then it may have been too late. Its later movies got a handle on how to actually adapt the books, but all told I'm not sure these movies suffice for non-book readers. They work better as visual counterpart than narratives of their own, and now that the event-ness of them is over and we can all stop dressing up to go to the theatre, I think it's safe to mark them down as mostly illustration.--PolarisDiB",6,5,8,21 July 2011

Casino," Overstimulating Strip
","Scorsese follows up GoodFellas with a sort of variation on the theme, creating a similar structure but with different characterization and mood. Both GoodFellas and Casino tell a true story of mob activity in two parts, the rise to power and the inevitable downfall, featuring interwoven voice-over narration, pop music, and, well, Joe Pesci as short fuse to a bomb gone out of anybody's control. They contain different enough elements however that comparing them too closely can misconstrue the point of both; nevertheless, the similarities are there.Casino immediately appeals with its Saul Bass opening titles, and then quickly keeps up the momentum with sharp cinematography glorying in the light and spectacle of the Las Vegas Strip. The Strip is a popular place for filmmakers to play with the light and imagery, and Scorsese is all over it with some amazingly striking and glorious compositions. On a purely visual level, this movie is more than worth the time to check out, and on that note may be better watched silently.Because, the thing is, it's also very noisy. With almost never-ending voice over, constant music, and Sharon Stones superb but still harrowing performance of an overwrought junky falling into sheer hysterics, the very few and all too short moments of silence in this movie stand out for their sheer contrast, and end up being the high notes. It's a shame, too, because technically this is DeNiro's finest performance along the 'detached, cool, but cares' mode, and he plays a genuinely likable character who wants to play it as straight as possible and knows how to make everyone happy--provided they actually listen to him, which of course they don't, and provided that nothing goes wrong, which of course they do.There's so much to like individually about the film that it is hard to criticize it as a whole. Each individual scene works on its own level, most of them involving DeNiro and Stone as they work through their relationship (one of the most heartwarming moments when he proposes to her, and one of the most heartbreaking moments when he discovers their daughter tied up), the storytelling is sharp, and the visuals straight up eyecandy, but Scorsese still overdoes it in all marks, creating an overwhelming and mostly overstimulating project out of the whole. Form following function? Technically the Strip is one of the world's most famous realms of fully immersive virtual reality, along with New York Times Square, the Mall of the Emiratis in Dubai, and too many places in Tokyo to name. However, that not being a thematic point of Scorsese's movie at all, it doesn't really help the fact that he could have used a little reserve letting the individual pieces work on their own without distracting them from one another by layering them over each other.--PolarisDiB",6,1,2,27 August 2010
300," From legend to myth
","Fact: At one point, Spartans faced an army of Persians during the Battle of Thermopylae. History: A dispute exists over whether it was 300 or 30000, whether they were aided by other Greek city-states or not, or even if the intentions were to hold off the Persians or merely partake in glory. Legend: Sparta, a warrior state, was full of amazingly tough and blood-thirsty men who could hold off hordes of people despite their small numbers because they are so awesome like that.And then we arrive to this movie, Myth: 300 chiseled men go head-to-head with billions of Persians, Lord-of-the-Rings-style orcs, giants, beasts, monsters, and about anything the imagination can hold (including men with swords for arms and enormous rhinoceri). It's awesome, it's entertaining, and it's absolutely wonderfully gratuitous! Of course the thing about myth is that it's also a mediated value system. Whereas I can be assured that neither Frank Miller nor Zack Snyder intended any direct theme beyond the glory of being warrior men dying in battle, some of the more Western hegemonic characteristics of this movie go from absurd to downright disturbing.I have talked to a lot of people about this movie since I saw it and have learned that no matter which way I present this idea, it's an unpopular one, but I'm sorry: whether the filmmakers intended it, or not, this movie is jingoistic patriotism wrapped in testosterone-addled bigotry. The dialog is right out of contemporary fallacy and there's only a few uncanny parallels that keep returning a sense of contemporary urgency to the mix... Those 'Athenian' (read, French) 'boy lovers and philosophers', the corrupt oracles (the UN), fighting 'as free men for freedom' (even within the historically inaccurate--and let me stress that it's not supposed to be historically accurate--but even within the historically inaccurate imagery the Spartans still show no sign in their culture of being 'a free state'), the 'surge' at the end, and even the general focus on war as glory do nothing but bog down the action with strikingly propagandistic appeal. I mean, it certainly wasn't character development! The thing is, though, the movie is still fun, still worth it, despite that daunting theme. The imagery is, in fact, beautiful, the action is tight and interesting, and the long battles maintain their interest despite the fact that it would seem they would become repetitive. Indeed, I think this movie's only problem was adding to, rather than subtracting from, the dialog from the graphic novel. The entire side story of the Queen? Unnecessary. The longer dialog between the Persian messenger and the King? Unnecessary. Funnily enough, this movie could have used LESS plot than it already had! The sex scene? Worst sex scene in the history of cinema.Something that's interesting about this film though is how well it succeeds in being Greek. Instead of carving men out of marble, it carves marble out of men, but the actual imagery of them (in profile, in close-up like a bust, etc.) really does match with Greek Classic and Hellenistic sculpture. Everybody who comments on this movie has something to say about the visuals in terms of how the action and the atmosphere play out, but I would imagine the Ancient Greeks themselves would be very proud of the imagery described.This is an event film... it should and shall be watched in the theatre. Seeing it on any smaller screen will vastly reduce it's imagery and unfortunately will also make the yelling-command-pseudo-dialog seem even MORE absurd. I'm also pretty sure as time goes on this movie will lose its novelty and people will begin to hear what it's actually saying.--PolarisDiB",6,17,36,19 March 2007
The Great Escape," Escape and flight
","Fun, optimistic prisoner-of-war movie about a group of Allied POWs put into a German camp exclusively for those who tend to try to escape. Thus, they try to escape, en masse. Care is put into the camaraderie, personality, and general friendliness of most of the characters, while showing in a couple scenes how nevertheless the imprisoned life is slowly demoralizing some of the men.The escape itself is interesting, but the movie really didn't focus a lot on the watchful Goons (Nazis), making it seem at times as if the whole camp is given free reign to just do what they choose--obviously, making escape much more likely. Somehow I kind of expect the whole ordeal that this movie is based off of was a bit more challenging and paranoid, and I would have liked to see that.Where the movie does get really good is post-escape, as the several characters split ways and attempt to get out of the country, to various results. Steve McQueen's bike chase is, of course, a famous scene, made all the more silly by the knowledge that McQueen himself is the one who suggested it, and all the more riveting because his own bike is used and he also doubled for one of the Germans, meaning in this movie Steve McQueen chases himself. One thing few prison or prisoner-of-war escape movies tend to focus on is the problem of getting back into the world after outside the prison walls--those movies tend to assume that once the tunnel is dug, freedom is pretty much a skip and a leap away. It's much more compelling to see the POWs trying to blend in, sneak through, hide, steal, row, ride, and fly their way out of the country.--PolarisDiB",7,3,6,18 August 2008
Pineapple Express," Needn't toke to enjoy this one, but what the hey, can't hurt either...
","Well, I knew this was 'just a stoner movie' going in, though the trailer had a few laughs and it was directed by David Gordon Green. It's practically not worth reciting, but, uh, Judd Apatow and his crew. Man-boy. Those same old words that are in practically every review of these movies. And anyway...Pineapple Express starts out really well and manages to keep the humor up through most of its playlength. The dialog is pretty spot on in places, and the relationship between the two leads is actually really believable and moving. The real fun of it is that pretty much every party involved in the plot really has an imperfect notion of what is going on, leading to some pretty hilarious sequences as takers, dealers, and everyone in between psych themselves out over what is mostly just hyperactive imaginations--though sometimes they're actually correct, making it all the more silly.The second half? Not so great. Once the various parties start meeting and the guns start going off, the movie leans towards wanting to be serious as a sort of tease, then just goes for the slapstick and absurd. Make no mistake: it's funny, but it detracts from the real humor of a plethora of characters slowly wigging out over things they know nothing about, mostly as a result of being under the influence. Sorry, but once the action starts, it's like a cheap Hot Fuzz knock off... the sequences are silly but rather ridiculous, and some of them really lead no where.Also, there are some pretty massive plot holes in this movie, the type you can stick an arm through and see yourselves flipping off the writer over. Yes, I know: stoner movie, no one cares. No reason to at least put in a single line of dialog saying, 'Hey, I happen to know something about a supposed secret hideout, maybe it's actually there' instead of just having characters randomly show up there. I mean, I know expectations are low on this movie, but that's no reason to just ignore significant plot points.What does make the movie up is the performances and the contemporary pop culture savvy. This is definitely a movie with legs, the type of one that people will watch in 20 years and be all like, 'Hahaha, ahhh the millennium!' (like watching Dazed and Confused and laughing about the 90s). And as Apatow productions go, this is one that manages to be just intelligent enough to not be 'Dewey Cox' BS and still silly enough to not drag like 'Knocked Up'.What the heck. Check it out. And if you're the type, go ahead and toke before you go, because as Rogan's character says, 'Weed makes everything better... bad days, bad music, bad movies...' Luckily this one didn't have to be all that bad, so that the weed isn't required.--PolarisDiB",7,0,2,10 August 2008
Moon," Humanistic space odyssey
","It's nice to have some decently crafted science fiction still being made. The increased availability of CGI and digital effects for even low-budget productions along with its better quality has finally reached the level where we can do something important with it: focus on the human.Moon is a movie about an astronaut on a three-year solo job in space. He is harvesting moon rocks for energy (something explained concisely at the beginning), and staves off boredom by exercising, growing plants, building a model of his home town, and talking to his wife via belated signals. As he nears the end of his term, he begins to hallucinate and gets into an accident. When he wakes up, he finds himself. Literally, as in he finds himself still crashed in the accident and saves himself from a cold lonely death. The problem is, now there's two of him, a crashed harvester unit, and a robot who seems not the least bit logically put off by his doppelganger presence.Sam Rockwell gets to do the Dead Ringers duty here and play off himself, which is fun, and also brings a strong sense of dynamic to what was almost a movie about a single guy alone in space. Duncan Jones does a good job directing his first feature film, and on a tight budget creates a realistic lunar landscape that you'll see no flaw in. Kevin Spacey is perfect for the voice of GERTY 3000, a kinder, gentler, and more humanistic HAL 3000 with a smiley face instead of a big red eye. Music by Clint Mansell will be playing in your ears long after you leave the theatre.All around, a quiet science fiction hit. It could have done without the newsfeed ending that turned a rather flat political message onto a perfectly hopeful and open ending. GERTY's personality or programming was a little too deus ex machina, but on the other hand was a refreshing change from the general technophobic cliché of most robots straining to follow orders at the expense of the sanity or lives of their cares. The rest is all nitpicking.--PolarisDiB",8,3,6,10 July 2009
Slumdog Millionaire," Uncanny acumen
","Danny Boyle world: a place that's achingly gorgeous, seriously tragic, terrifyingly dangerous, and that I love to visit but have nightmares about living in. While zombies on steroids are attacking people in a poeticly empty London, while astronauts hide from sun-deranged madman, and while kids are trying to do the right thing with money they've stumbled across, down in India an 18 year old kid destroys the caste system while only attempting to get the attention of someone he loves. Sure, Boyle has nothing like a View Askewniverse or anything like that, but all of his movies seem to exist in a space where characters' struggles for survival get second-place for their need to fit in, belong, and justify having hearts. His genre-jumping techniques belie an inimitable style that really makes everything he does worth watching.Slumdog Millionaire is almost like to City of God what 28 Days Later... was to Dawn of the Dead--there are some major parallels both in story and structure, but Boyle's monster eventually takes sway over any comparisons and turns the movie into its own unique journey. Both Slumdog and City of God could have been really shot down critically due to seemingly excessive styles for such non-digital worlds they represent, except that they were so superbly done that you cannot help but fall in love with them. Boyle's acumen is such, though, that he's able to lead you through fear, longing, shock, and grief before taking you to probably the purest of happy endings deftly and articulately, whereas Moreille's City sometimes lost track of the emotional background while playing with its techniques.Everything is in high form here. The script is amazing, creating believable characters and painful dialog while deftly juggling three different points in time until they all arrive in their poignant destination (from the most rote meaning of the word, sharing its roots with Destiny). The acting is superb and it's nearly impossible to see the actors through it, especially when three different kids play the same characters and it's hard not to believe that they weren't really the same person. Danny Boyle gets into Mumbai and other locations in India and shows it from many different perspectives that don't just show what he see's it's like, but represents the characters' vastly chaotic integration into a varied and uncertain world. He also picks out a superb soundtrack capable of both blowing out the speakers with awesomeness and also deftly increasing the drama in the scene--something he does often, but this time is even more worth mentioning because he mixes Indian rhythms with the well-known dramatic digital sounds of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire with an original score, and the mix is seamless.However, technical specifics aside, quite frankly its nearly impossible not to like this movie. Jamal's romantic view of life mixed with already well-ingrained drama of the show, thematic plays with destiny and true-love, an alertness to the troubles of the world without the need to turn the movie into its own sentimental essay, all are powerful ingredients in this concoction. For all the intensely visual play with style and hand-held cameras, Boyle has remarkable reserve in alluding to the passions that drive him but making sure that the story drives the audience. It's actually really uncanny. One of the things that impressed me a lot about 28 Days Later... when I first saw it so many years ago is how even as a good horror movie it managed to both have the ability to make a point without slamming it into people's faces, and to coexist with the perception that there is more to the world than just what's happening to the characters. This approach comes out stronger than ever in Slumdog Millionaire, and as long as Boyle keeps up with it, I will continue to be an avid viewer of his works.--PolarisDiB",10,2,5,4 January 2009
The Runaways," The popularized aesthetic of the middle finger
","Initially, this movie seems like the type of joke people paste on message boards called 'What's the worst idea for a movie ever?' 'How about a movie about The Runaways featuring the chick from Twilight as Joan Jett and that one little girl from How the Grinch Stole Christmas as Cherie Currie?' Hahahaha--oh.However, let's consider a few things first. One, I hear down the grapevine that Kristen Stewart takes Twilight about as seriously as the guys who made Vampires Suck. However, it's a job that provides her exposure and money. Secondly, with Hound Dog, Dakota Fanning pretty much announced that she intends to be a serious actor and not next year's forgotten childhood star television special. This movie makes a bad marketing decision by playing out of typecast, but the stars make a good marketing decision by playing out of typecast. This makes the relative success or lack thereof of this movie at least somewhat interesting. Here is an opportunity for these two actresses to break out of type.But back to step one. We're talking about a movie about The Runaways. People who want to see movies about The Runaways want punks, rebellion, and disestablishment. However, this is obviously a commercial film. Those who want to see a nice movie featuring the innocent Bella Swan or cute-as-button blond girl from yesterday don't want punks, rebellion, and disestablishment. So the movie is kind of set up for failure before it even starts.Okay, so, that said.... how is it? To be perfectly honest, it's pretty charming. Stewart and Fanning get to strut, lurch, scowl, and slouch their way through that world of popular youth angst that, ironic as those subcultures really are, at least are refreshingly angry and passionate in light of that new form of commercialized teen depression, emo. It features sex, drugs, and rock and roll without editing or shying away from any of those three concepts (especially incredible considering the leads' ages). And the movie is a straight-up old school underdog story that gives every fourteen year old sneaking into a club hope that they'll get discovered by a record producer just because of the devil-may-care 'tude on their faces and tee-shirts. It is everything romantic about the rocker aesthetic, where even the negative things such as drug abuse and band conflict is part and parcel of Musician's American Dream.Thing being, of course, that it's no Almost Famous. This is all familiar territory, the rise to fame, the fall from grace, psychedelic breakdowns leading into junky rock soundtracks as the hospital scenes start stacking up and the stars stop having so much fun scene to scene. What it does have is a lipsticked Michael Shannon having fun as producer Kim Fowley, Fanning in Lolita chic, girls helping girls figure out how to get off, and yes, cinematography with wide angle lenses, hand-held moments, slow motion, saturated colors, club lights reflected off rain on taxi windows, everything set to rhythmic rumblings of electric guitar--you know, rock and roll. Yeah alright: underneath all the streaking eyeliner and angry expressions is something arguably quite vapid; but then again, that's kinda what rock and roll is, full dedication to acting out and getting fame and admiration for it.It is, in the end, a well-produced and delivered form of the genre, and audiences' enjoyment of it will probably be directly correlated to their interest in the concept. For me, more than anything, I saw it purely out of curiosity to see where Fanning and Stewart are going. From what I saw, somewhere good, even if it is set up for too-cool-for-their-own-old-school hipsters to hate it on principle.--PolarisDiB",7,1,4,10 September 2010
The Social Network," Sork the Finch of the Eisenzuckerberg.
","To paraphrase 99.9% of the reviews about this movie out there, 'David Fincher helms Aaron Sorkin's script about Mark Zuckerberg played by Jesse Eisenberg, who's Jesse Eisenbergness infuses Sorkin's Zuckerberg with Fincher's unique style of Sorkinian Eisenberg Sorkin Fincher, of which Fincher Sorkin make Eisenzuck and Sorks to the Fincherian Jesse Mark Zucksenbergergerai. I loved/hated it, it was terrible/brilliant. Facebook is a terrible thing even though I use it.' With reviews like that, I expected a movie with Personality, capital P. Actually, it was just a really good corporate thriller, which is nice because if we're going to mention Fincher, he's a director who can pull off anything technically, but obviously really prefers to make thrillers (The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, at times, seemed almost sad that there wasn't a serial killer stalking the Katrina-looming streets). The movie firmly places Zuckerberg at well past the awkward computer geek to suffering some level of antisocial dysfunction, spins him into a dog-eat-dog world of ego and greed, and then throws him off as a tragic hero at the end before they can go as far as to implicate him as some sort of murderer. It's high-octane action whilst the characters mostly sit at computers and hearing boards. As goes the Sorkinish writing of Fincherian plotting of Eisenberg portrayal of something or the other namedrop Justin Timberlake.Anyway, underlining most of how the movie works is the character Zuckerberg's habit of lashing out verbally like a cornered rat--even as the movie is opening. Those moments are the punctuation marks that structure the beats in this general shark frenzy, and would probably explain why most of this movie was shot as if Mark were in prison from the get-go. Thing is, if you watch contemporary biopics of people of the past, you tend to see such underlying emphasis (some call it exaggeration; others call it 'drama') in aspects of real people's character, placing this movie quite firmly in the 'inspired by' spectrum of the 'based on a true story' paradigm. This is some story, indeed, but it was a mistake to make it so soon--firmly centering the audience's grasping of what's real and what's fantasy as a major drama where otherwise a rather fun genre film would suffice.But the Internet is boggling Hollywood and so someone like Fincher has to step up to make something that isn't Eagle Eye. I still do not think Hollywood 'gets' the Internet. Just look at the DVD cover, visually weighted almost completely by an entire pillar of critic blurbs. They seem to be expecting that us Internet kids with our multiple tabs opened in Firefox and columnar listings of interests are attracted by visual noise in graphic design, when such phenomena exist specifically because covers like that are tl;dr. But at least the movie itself doesn't fall into the same detachment from its audience as Sony's marketing department, firmly establishing its type-A personalities and biting ironies as existing in some horror land Harvard far beyond the well-lit streets of lolcats and message boards.At least they didn't make a 4chan movie. That would be Miike's Ichi the Killer to this movie's Se7en.--PolarisDiB",8,0,0,24 April 2011
The Proposal," Great performances hold attention away from less substantial structure
","As romcoms go, this one is pretty high quality on the performative standard. Bullock and Reynolds are attractive and believable, the dialog is sharp, the story is interesting, the characters are fun to pay attention to, it stays close to familiar territory while being new enough to be interesting and not downright boring. As a date movie goes, this is a better example of the genre and I can definitely see why it made so much over the summer; and with this and Miss Congeniality, Bullock is certainly a new kind of chick flick hero who manages to be very sexy while not being very girly or ridiculous.On the technical side, not so much. The continuity in this movie is atrocious (literally, a big deal is made about a man frozen in mid-sentence with his glasses in his hands, then cuts to his reaction and the glasses are nowhere to be seen--understandable if the glasses weren't a major part of his reaction), the lighting is very uneven (though the wedding was nice and the Alaskan summer was realistic), and sometimes the blocking itself loses complete track of where the characters are in space. Anne Fletcher obviously spent a long time working with the actors and getting the performances while not concentrating so hard on the blocking and camera movement. I still say it works, since Bullock and Reynolds really hold all of the attention. If there were any problem with the world created at all it would mostly be that the supporting characters and background is not nearly as interesting as the leads.",7,0,1,15 November 2009
Jurassic Park," Most excellent!
","Great action adventure that can appeal to everyone? Check.Substantial dialog that makes the characters interesting? Check.Great character development that makes us care about them as they fall further and further into danger? Check.Crisp, clean directing and editing that is not only state of the art, but really hasn't been surpassed visually very much in the past decade? Check.Awesome, believable acting? Check.Commentary about the nature of science to add depth to the storyline? Check.A bunch of scientists are invited to Jurassic Park, a zoological exhibition that is a little different... John Hammond, its creater, has genetically engineered dinosaurs from isolated DNA strands from prehistoric mosquitos trapped in fossilized amber. He invites the scientists so that they may endorse his park to open it to the public, but a greedy computer engineer and other problems soon let the dinosaurs out of their cages, endangering the island's visitors and creating an unforgettable special effects adventure.Time is slowly outdating the science in this science fiction adventure, but the graphics and action are brilliantly done and very realistic, keeping the realism at the essence of the suspense still gripping. It also contains some of the best performances ever put into a summer blockbuster. Everything as large as a brachiosaurus and small as a little hand gesture are finely crafted by everyone involved into perfection.It's a movie that shall never go extinct.--PolarisDiB",10,4,6,18 October 2005
Evil Dead II," ADD horror comedy
","Ironically enough, I saw Army of Darkness before seeing this one. It's weird, but I don't actually like Evil Dead 2 and Army of Darkness quite as much as Evil Dead, and not nearly as much as most other people seem to do. I'm no stranger to camp cult classics, but Sam Raimi's particular brand of over-the-top pleasure always involves a sort of forcefulness, a kind of shouting, of the dialog and actions so that everything seems so frantic all of the time. Evil Dead still had this type of humor, but relaxed it and let it flow a bit... this movie pretty much shows off the scenes Raimi was interested in and which ones he just put in there for the story to connect. The beginning shoots by without a breath... the ending drags... some scenes or jokes are emphasized beyond their range, and other stuff is just shown and thrown away before the audience has time to really grasp it.However, Evil Dead 2 is much stronger than Army of Darkness, mostly from its physical comedy. Ash's wrestling with his own hand is some pretty genius stuff, and the scene where the entire house becomes animated, starting with a deer's bust, is pretty much one of the most trippy and bizarre scenes I've seen in cinema--the type of thing that would have scared the crap out of me if the silliness of the rest of the movie hadn't bracketed it in.I think the intention behind Evil Dead 2 and Army of Darkness was good, but I think Raimi could have stood to pace it down a bit and put less emphasis on being frenetic and hyperactive. If it wasn't for the fact that obviously these two movies took a lot of work (especially with the stop-motion animation and other special effects), I'd assume Raimi was having a prolonged bout of ADD during the filming of them.--PolarisDiB",6,2,4,18 August 2008
V for Vendetta," Many things to amaze and stun, but it's the character(s) that count
","In this rather colorful and clean (albeit darkly lit) futuristic British world, a fascist government has taken control. And since we don't like fascists, we need a very colorfully masked character to save us all from being mindless sheep. He also is wonderfully poetic, too, making him more than just a zealous terrorist: he's an artist.Hugo Weaving is, frankly, amazing. Not only does he have to overcome his (basically) typecast nature (who really saw him as Elrond in The Lord of the Rings? No, everyone saw him as Mr. Smith posing as a zealous elf), but he has to do so without a face. His voice acting is one thing, but its the pantomime that matches the voice acting that gives this character its compelling nature. He's graceful, and poetic, and artistic, and swashbuckling... and straight out of silent film, despite his 'verbose' dialog. That is why when he does stuff like pretending to be strangled by an empty suit of armor or speak an entire paragraph with words starting only with V, it actually works. No seriously, it's brilliant.Natalie Portman supports well, but none more so real than when she's really put into a testy situation. She moves from fear to chaos to acceptance to love in a moments notice, exactly the way the audience wants to move with her. Despite V's rather straightforward narration of events, it's at Evey's speed that we try to alternatively catch up and slow down to understand what's going on.And finally, Stephen Rea. Wow, what a perfect choice for that role. Now the movie mentions that he's Irish (and we all know what that means to England and it's ideals of status quo), but it barely even needs to. Not only is Rea's nationality perfect for the part, but the way he's proved himself through such films as The Crying Game really endear us to the guy who is suddenly shocked out of the status quo... and is now in the position to make a major decision about whether to reject or accept this sudden change. If anyone should be given credit for this film's success, it's the casting director.Now the story is a 'pretty good one', though it's really engaging mostly through its in-depth explorations of its characters. I haven't read the graphic novel. I've read enough vitrolic rants about this movie to understand that it gets nowhere near the depth of these characters as presented in the original work. But unlike such adaptations as our infamous Harry potter series and the like, this movie does have a certain care and understanding for the characters, doing the best it can to really give them lives and histories... and sidestories. In fact, it felt like this movie could go on forever, and that even if it did, I wouldn't have minded.I think there's two major places the story fails to make this film from good to really great. The first is that some of the dialog just simply doesn't hold up to some of the other dialog... V's lines are great (though I understand they are much better in the original work), but stuff like the policemen's constant repetition about coincidences doesn't hold up well.Secondly, at first it's really unclear why exactly the government we're watching is evil (except with the usual Big Talking Head that always makes us think of Big Brother), then even when it's cleared up, it's hard to understand why the subjects are so ready and willing to jump on the V bandwagon and practice 'Anarchy in the UK!' (By the way, was that line necessary either? I think this movie had enough trouble from the beginning without having to sound like a stupid punk who doesn't realize the 70s ended more than a quarter of a century ago). However, that's not to say that this film isn't full of some really strong points. I think what did it for me was the comedy show featuring the Grand Chancellor being humiliated. Both as a loving homage to British humor past and present, and as a thumbs up to satire and the power of daring media, it's a grand addition to the preceedings. The comedian's subsequent arrest places it into a morbid theme: you can't just talk about it or joke about it. You have to act to change it. Hint to the left, in case they're wondering why their 'Impeach Bush' stickers aren't doing anything.And about the politics, since it's such a big issue. This movie is very stunted in that it uses discourses we use today, and the Wachowskis are obviously very intent in putting a bit of Bush-bashing into it. It wasn't very necessary, but it worked out in places like the little quip about the Avian flu and whatnot. Personally, I could have used a much broader and somewhat universally-themed approach, especially since this film seems to be almost begging in parts for the Right to get angry at it so that it could get some free publicity.That said, despite all these things here, all these things here which weren't quite good enough to have me absolutely raving about it, I can't help but really love it for those characters. I think what appeals most about V is that not only is his mask just a wonderfully distinct image, but he has absolute control over a world where power seems to be utterly lacking. I especially love that last fight scene he does at the end with the vapor-trails around the knives. I've heard a lot of scoffing about how that's just pointless bullet-time, but it isn't bullet time. It's V's utter, almost mystical, control over the elements and the energy around him right as he's about to kick some serious booty. I think that's a great way of turning the Wachowski's self-created image into something entirely new.--PolarisDiB",6,3,7,30 March 2006
