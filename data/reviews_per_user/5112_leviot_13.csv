The Devil's Advocate," Pacino shines again in this story of vanity vs. morality
","Kevin Lomax is a rising young star. He's a slick-talking, intelligent lawyer, and he's never lost a case. So he figures it's time to move up to the big city, join a big firm, and enjoy great success and make a lot of money. But the firm he joins is full of greed and malice, and his boss, John Milton, is an eccentric hotshot who is acting very strangely. He begins to become alienated from his wife, driven just by money and fame, and just when it seems like everything he cares about has gone to waste, he finds out the shocking true identity of his overzealous boss...'The Devil's Advocate' is a very entertaining story about fame and vanity and the evil places it can lead one to. Keano Reeves does a fine job portraying the young attorney. Charlize Theron is phenomenal as his pretty wife. But it is Al Pacino who (not surprisingly) steals the show, acting out the mysterious and strange boss.As the movie reaches its' climax, Reeves and Pacino confront each other in a scene that's gotta rank up there with one of the greatest in motion picture history. Pacino's diatribe about God is simply brilliant.My only criticism of this film is the overdone goriness of some of it's scenes and the unnecessary lewdness portrayed. If you have the stomach to sit through some of that, you will be absolutely mesmerized by this well-plotted and well-acted film. Absolutely Recommended.",9,1,1,25 May 2006
Mission: Impossible III," Lives up to its billing
","Mission Impossible III is pretty much what you can expect out of a movie of this caliber. It keeps you enraptured and entertained, the actors and the action sequences do not disappoint, but it is what it is: another shallow action flick. So if you don't expect more from it than that (like me) you will not be disappointed, and actually find watching it to be quite a fun and engaging experience.Replete with clever schemes, and unexpected twists and turns, MI III is gonna hold your attention and have you hold your breath at times. Following Ethan Hunt with that constant determined look in his eye, first doing what he's told to do, and then doing whatever it takes to save his wife, you will enjoy having come along for the ride.Tom Cruise is a top-flight actor as long as the script remains reasonably simple and shallow, that's why his action exploits are extremely fun to watch, while the endearing scenes with his wife are not. Philip S. Huffman almost steals the show, as the lizard-eyed villain, playing his part very believably. Laurence Fishburn delivers the goods as usual, playing the mysterious head of the agency. Michelle Monaghan does a fine job as Hunt's wife.Bottom line: It's not all that, but it's worth the price of admission.",7,0,0,11 May 2006
The Big Lebowski," It's not about the destination; it's about the journey
","Do not watch this movie expecting a nice clean storyline from top to bottom. In fact, you shouldn't expect anything clean out of this movie, including The Dude's rug. Not to say there is no plot to 'The Big Lebowski', there is, it's just completely inconsequential. This is a flick you want to watch when you don't have much else to do, you're feeling kinda relaxed, and you have a beer (or a white Russian) in your hands. The Dude will fascinate you, him and all his quirky friends.If you watched it once, watch it again. The dialogue and the lines are so uniquely funny. You will find new subtleties every time you watch it. If anyone gives you trouble just say 'Hey, easy, there's a beverage here!'",10,0,1,6 April 2006
Fight Club," Dark and delirious yet thoughtful and enlightening
","'Fight Club' is a movie of a rare caliber, one that makes its points unrestrainedly, its characters dominate the screen with vivacious personalities. It has a dream-like quality to it, but it is excruciatingly real. A reality that gets uglier and more twisted until its stunning ending. Love it or hate it, it's a movie you will not soon forget.Edward Norton's character, who narrates throughout the film, is a depressed fellow with a dead-beat job, an insomniac who finds his only pleasures in attending support groups for the terminally ill. His life takes an unexpected turn when he meets Marla, a woman who finds herself in similar straits.Enter Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt): A young, clever and energetic guy, an activist who rants against the evils of our consumer-driven society. Their obvious differences notwithstanding, our narrator and Tyler strike up a strange friendship.Things remain on the relatively down-low, until out of the clear blue, Tyler tells his pal 'hit me!'. After they begin brawling randomly to release their natural pent-up aggression, the idea catches on, and they formally found 'Fight Club', a club that lets men be men without the artificial influences of consumerism, or the superficial effects of conformist society.But as 'Fight Club' gains popularity and begins to spread throughout the country, problems begin creeping up, both within Fight Club and in the personal lives of our narrator and his on-and-off girlfriend Marla.I think many critics were too creeped out by the dark and violent aspects of this movie, to give it its deserved due for its thought-provoking and intelligent script. Not to mention, its phenomenal acting, which aside from the great performance we expect out of Ed Norton who seems to thrive in these kind-of 'dark' roles, Brad Pitt establishes himself as a truly good actor (not just a 'pretty boy') and is just so ideal for the character of Tyler Durden.Unless you're extremely averse to dark and violent movies, this is a must-see for its unique and uninhibited storyline and extraordinary characters. It has an ending that matches those of The Sixth Sense and The Usual Suspects. Its thought-provoking ideas and concepts will be further enlightened after multiple viewings. Not to be missed.",9,0,2,23 May 2006
The Usual Suspects," Absolutely brilliant piece of entertainment
","'The Usual Suspects' has such a flair and a flamboyance about it, it's brilliance goes way beyond it's surprising ending. Rarely does a film mesmerize its viewers the this one does. Watching 'the Usual Suspects', you feel like you're being transported into the treacherous world of crime and criminals. You try to figure out who can be trusted, who cannot be trusted and who is just a distraction. You keep guessing who is who, and what is what, and it gives you no rest till the very end. I've watched many movies, but rarely does a movie 'get' to me the way this one did. When it finished I just sat back going 'Wow'! and I watched it over and over to pick up hidden clues I might have missed along the way. This film is not just a mystery movie, it's also a great drama, with bits of comedy and action sprinkled in. I was a big fan of Kevin Spacey before I watched this film, and after this it only solidified my opinion of him as the greatest pure actor of his generation. I think 'The Usual Suspects' ranks up there with the greatest movies of the last century, and it's definitely the best in it's genre to come out over the last 25 years or so.",10,0,1,16 April 2006
Lawrence of Arabia," A Masterpiece
","This film is an absolute classic. It's an amazing story of one man's influence on an entire culture. A great cinematic portrayal of the Arabs' life in the vast expanse of the desert. It very deftly depicts the political waves of the time, how the colonizing nations of Europe tried to exploit the less civilized nations of Asia and the middle east.But the theme and crux of the film is about one man: Lawrence. A man with the guts and bravery to inspire Millions, yet a man who was psychologically tormented. Lawrence, essentially, seems to be a manic-depressive. Most of the time he has a courageous nothing-can-kill-me attitude, with unending hope and optimism. But then he falls into a pit of depression and loneliness, and even hopelessness.I found this apparent dichotomy in the man to be most fascinating, and it is portrayed very skillfully by the actor who plays Lawrence. The contrast in Lawrence is an interesting historical perspective on the man, and a great allegorical perspective on men in general.",10,2,5,25 May 2006
Good Will Hunting," Outstanding drama, with great depth
","'Good Will Hunting' will always remain one of my favorite movies. It has an engaging storyline, great acting, and enormous emotional depth. It's hard to believe Matt Damon and Ben Affleck were young college students when they conceived of this complex story.The story is about Will Hunting (Matt Damon) a troubled young man who is working as a night janitor at Harvard University. He also happens to be a one-of-a-kind math genius, and catches the attention of award-winning math professor Gerald Lambeau (Stellan Skarsgard) as he begins solving difficult math problems left on the blackboard.Will, however, has no interest in pursuing a prestigious career in mathematics. He only reluctantly agrees to hold private lessons with the professor, being the only way to get out of jail after a spate of violence lands him there. Part of his parole deal, however, is to meet with a therapist twice a week. After getting a couple of shrinks to give up on him, Will finally lands with psychology teacher Sean Maguire (Robin Williams) who has a similar background as Wills', hailing from the same tough neighborhood in south Boston.As Sean tries to get through to Will emotionally, the professor tries to train Will's mind in advanced mathematics. All the while, Will, who has had trouble maintaining a loving relationships due to his troubled past, begins to get seriously involved with a girl named Skylar (Minnie Driver). Meanwhile, the professor and the psychiatrist, who've had a rivalry of sorts back in their day, begin to quibble over what's best for Will's future.Filled with great profound dialogs and intense emotional scenes, it's an immense emotional experience. It obviously has very 'heavy' subject-matter, and thus not an easy light watch, but it is very rewarding and entertains throughout.It's also a great buy because you will need repeated viewings to appreciate all its subtleties.",10,1,4,25 May 2006
Big Fish," Brilliant movie, if you're deep enough to 'get it'
","THIS REVIEW CONTAINS MILD SPOILERS AFTER THE FIRST TWO PARAGRAPHSThis is an absolutely brilliant thought-provoking movie. It's unique and original and very thoughtful. It's about how people view their lives and the accomplishments they made therein. The basic storyline is about a father who keeps on telling tall tales about his past, which frustrates his son, who wants to hear the truth about his father.This is really one of those movies you're either gonna love or you're gonna hate. People walk out of this one either thinking 'Wow! that was brilliant, I gotta watch it again' or going 'What the @#$%! was that all about!'.It's got a similar theme as 'Secondhand Lions', about a man nearing death trying to make sense of his life. The only way he finds comfort in his past is to fabricate all these tall tales that make it sound like he had this heroic and glorious past, while in reality he led a pretty average life. But to the father it doesn't matter whether the stories are false or slightly exaggerated, because often in life it's not really about what is true or not, it's more what we feel or believe in any particular situation. So even if he hadn't done all those heroic things, he feels that he would've done them given the chance, or thats what he really wanted to do.The son, however, doesn't understand that. He wants to communicate with his real father, not with some seemingly illusionary superhero. Yet what he fails to understand is that that superhero character is his dad, because that's the way he chose to live and view his own life. Only towards the end does the son begin to understand and accept that, after the doctor at the hospital so poignantly remarks 'I don't know about you, but I kinda liked your father's version of the story better'.Aside from all that the movie's got some great lines, and the fantasy-land world created in the movie is a great mix of the real and the surreal. I didn't like the real slow pace of the film, but hey, I guess that's to be expected from a movie of this caliber.",9,0,3,18 April 2006
Once Upon a Time in America," Dramatic and artistic gangster movie
","The legendary filmmaker Sergio Leone has pulled off quite a feat in the making of 'Once Upon a Time in America', taking a story about brutal gangsters and weaving it together in such an artistic way, paradoxical as that may seem.'Once Upon a Time in America' is an almost 4 hour long experience about the lives of four Jewish friends who grew up in the lower east side of New York in the 1920s. It focuses primarily on the life of David Aranson, better known as 'Noodles'. A spunky kid, with an awkward yet flamboyant personality, Noodles begins an unlikely friendship with Max Bercovitz, which leads him into a life of crime.It's fair to say that this film is much more character-driven than it is action-driven. Each of the characters come alive as the story progresses from the 1920s to the 1930s and eventually to the late 1960s where the culmination of this lifelong drama occurs.There are a number of very clear distinctions between this gangster movie and others of its genre. For one, it's not a very talkative film, relying rather on slow well-shot scenes and facial expressions to tell its story. The entire movie has a surreal dream-like quality to it, and is replete with symbolism and allegory. The soundtrack is great addition to the film, and the playing of John Lennon's 'Yesterday' intermingled with the childhood flashbacks brought tears to my eyes.Just to give an example of the great symbolism in this film, there's a scene which seems rather insignificant, but upon further contemplation one realizes its allegorical meaning. When young 'Patsy' brings the cream pie in return for a sexual favor from Peggy. As Patsy waits for Peggy to exit her apartment, he can't resist the temptation of the delicious cake, and begins picking at its sides, figuring she won't notice. Then eventually he eats the cherry, then goes on to greedily devour the entire delicacy, leaving him with nothing to offer Peggy. This symbolizes the lives of these men, who with a little patience and forbearing could have lived much more meaningful lives, but they could never withstand the temptation of instant gratification and pleasure, which ultimately was their downfall.If I would have to use one word to describe this film though, it would be 'ambiguous'. Many scenes and lines can be interpreted in a myriad of ways. In fact, the meaning of many of its scenes have been widely debated over the years. Not the least of which being the opening and closing scenes of the movie in which Noodles is seen smoking in an opium den, prompting many to speculate that the entire movie, or all that happens from that point on, is an 'opium dream'.Nothing is more ambiguous and ambivalent than the central character of 'Noodles', played masterfully by Robert DeNiro. He is awkward and clumsy, yet he is cool and quick-witted. He is calm and collected, yet extraordinarily passionate. He is cruel, yet compassionate. Tough, yet very tender.One thing is for certain, to be able to watch this film and appreciate it properly one needs a lot of patience. Sergio Leone is notorious for his slow-paced movies, and this one tops it all. In fact, originally Leone wanted to release a 6 hour version, but was persuaded to cut it down to a 'mere' 3 hours and 47 minutes.",9,5,8,25 April 2006
Reservoir Dogs," Unique and amazing movie
","'Resevoir Dogs' is a one-of-a-kind film, which only a guy like Quentin Tarantino had the vision and guts to make, and it is, in my opinion, his best movie to date.Intense and thrilling from the first moment of the action, you find yourself in the back of a car with a man bleeding to death, being hauled away to the agreed hideout by his fellow criminal. A meticulously-planned heist just has gone awry, and someone is to blame. But who is the rat? The criminals don't even know each other's names as they all have been named in colors (Mr. Brown, Mr. Pink etc.) to protect their absolute anonymity. What will the boss have to say about this total botch-up, and how long will it take for the cops to track them down?What stands out about this movie is how straight-up and realistic it is. No cheesy banter, no makeup, no fake romances or over-hyped personalities. This film is as raw as they come. Just a bunch of criminals trying to figure out what the hell to do after their perfectly planned robbery has gone to ruin.It contains a lot of blood and gore, often too much to stomach. But it's all part of its realism. The filmmaker wants his audience to feel like they are living this story, that they are in that room with all these frantic, bloodied and bruised criminals trying to make sense of the situation. Unlike other films where you feel like you're watching someone else's life from afar, here you feel like you are there, part of this incomprehensible mess.The plot is delicious and it has no holes. The acting is so great, it will not seem like acting, but real life. A truly unique and engrossing film. Highly recommended, although not for the faint of heart.",10,0,2,24 April 2006
Pulp Fiction," Entertaining but it's pointless fluff
","THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SOME VERY MILD SPOILERS Pulp Fiction is an interesting movie which is funny, entertaining, contains some great lines and good performances by its actors. Now if I can only figure out what the hell the point of it is! Samuel L. Jackson is phenomenal, it's worth watching this movie just to see him as a bible-thumping eccentric criminal. John Travolta is great in a supporting role. Bruce Willis is also in this movie, although I've yet to figure out what exactly he's doing there.The movie begins with a scene of a guy and gal who decide to rob a cafÃ©, the movie's ending is the continuation (and culmination) of that scene. To me, that was the only cohesiveness in a movie that essentially has no plot or cohesive storyline. All the stuff in between is just a collection of scenes about drugs, violence, partying and some more violence.I'm the type of guy who enjoys deep movies, and movies with hidden messages and the like, but I've yet to figure out what the point of this movie is. It seemed like the general theme of it is 'what goes around comes around', but that still does not explain all the bizarre occurrences and interactions contained therein.Maybe there wasn't supposed to be a point to this movie. Maybe it's just for our transient amusement. Or perhaps it amuses the filmmaker that so many people are trying to find a point to a pointless movie. Either way, it's still worth watching. It has some not-to-miss scenes and dialouges. Rent it, don't buy it.",6,0,1,24 April 2006
To Kill a Mockingbird," Fantastic screen adaptation of a great American classic
","Most of us are familiar with Harper Lee's classical novel by this name about depression-era racism in the south seen through a child's eyes, so the first question that comes to mind about this movie is 'does it do justice to the book?', and the answer is a resounding 'yes!'.Gregory Peck delivers a great performance as Atticus Finch, the conscientious lawyer who defends a black man against false rape allegations. His children, Jem and Scout, played by Philip Alford and Mary Badham are extremely well-cast and act very naturally. Brock Peters is right-on as the accused Negro, with James Anderson doing a phenomenal job as the villain, Bob Ewell.Although this a story which is probably better fitted for a book than a movie, it does not lose any of its heart on-screen, thanks in part to screenwriter Horton Foote. Although filmed on a Hollywood set, the rustic ambiance of the old southern town is brought to life very vividly.The Bonus Features on the DVD include the academy award best-actor acceptance speech by Gregory Peck, as well as an interesting recent interview with Mary Badham.In the Two-Disc Special Edition the bonus features include an extensive interview with Gregory Peck, as well as a long documentary about the movie and its production. Almost the entire cast comments on different aspects of the film-making, including Philip Alford and Brock Peters.",9,1,2,25 May 2006
V for Vendetta," Great thought-provoking film
","'V for vendetta' is a futuristic thriller that builds on the story of an Englishman who attempted to blow up the parliament in London some 400 years ago. The story is set in London, after a tyrannical dictator has gained control over the country. The plot centers around an eccentric superhero known simply as 'V'. Unlike most superheros, however, it is not perfectly clear if 'V' is a good guy or a bad guy, or what his true intentions are. Hidden beneath a mask, he's a mystery man.I don't see the similarities to the 'Matrix', as others have suggested. I find it similar to 'Batman Begins' in both the plot line and the general cinematography. If you liked 'Batman Begins', this movie's definitely for you.Although it gets a bit boring and drawn out (and somewhat repetitive) at times, it gets better as it goes along. What you will really love about this movie, though, is it's thought-provoking ideas. The overriding message of this film is that, over the course of history, people come and guy, but great ideas persevere, and you can't kill ideas. it also offers a lot of insight into how governments can manipulate people through fear. We also see how the positive side of human nature, such as humor and good faith can (and ultimately will) prevail over oppression. It is also notably un-Hollywood in that everything's not so clear and clean-cut and you can draw your own conclusions about things.Some have suggested that this movie is a subtle jab at President Bush, especially in regards to the whole post-911 happenings. I cannot know what the filmmakers' true intentions were, but I, as a pro-Bush conservative was not offended by the movie. I agreed with basic premises that were set forth, in that conservative government gone amock can turn into a fanatical dictatorship.The acting all around is superb. Natalie Portman gives a great dramatic performance, arguably her best to date. John hurt is also great as the dictatorial leader of england.Overall, I found it to be an engrossing, entertaining and intelligent film. Unless you just like shallow flicks, you will appreciate this movie.",8,1,3,21 March 2006
