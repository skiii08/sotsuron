The Blair Witch Project," Fear of the most primal nature
","Welcome to a world where the worst can and does happen to you. The craftsmanship of fear is deftly and subtly handled in such a way that you're scared before you even realize it. By using three amateur film makers, and limiting the field of vision to ONLY what they shoot of themselves, you become intimate with the characters almost instantaneously. By the time the movie ends, you can and will believe that the same thing can and will happen to you and your loved ones..",9,1,3,26 April 1999
