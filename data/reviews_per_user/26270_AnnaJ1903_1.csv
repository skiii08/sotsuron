Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Mocking of Polish People.
","I am writing my opinion in order to honor my friends' family. They were exiled from Poland to Siberia in 1941. In the same period, many other Polish families were exiled to Kazakhstan to 'lagers'. Only the highest educated people from eastern part of Poland occupied that time by the Soviet Union were persecuted this way by the then communist regime. Many of them died there. Whoever read the book 'The Gulag Archipelago' by Alexander Solzhenitsyn, will understand what these people went through. It is unlikely, that a person from Poland could behave like Borat, because Polish people in Kazakhstan were the people with high culture, intellect and dignity. I doubt, that Polish people do not know who Jesus is or that they favor prostitution. One can ponder whether an exile can cause degeneration of nationality. It was sad, to watch this painful part of the history turned into a subject of comedy.",1,14,28,13 November 2006
