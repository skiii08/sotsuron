Saturday Night Fever," The undiscovered SNF
","What many people didn't appreciate about SNF was the lifestyle and environment in which this story is set. People don't understand that to be known throughout the neighborhood was a prevailing desire for its' inhabitants.As a resident of Brooklyn, the highest honor was and is, is to be known by people all around your neighborhood and beyond. I remember chatting with just such a person who kept insisting that if I asked anyone one all around the area, they would know who he is. This may seem foreign to most people but in the neighborhood in which Tony Monero grew up, this was paramount.Of course, this way of living escaped those audiences that were critical of the film. In all, this was a brilliant expose on life as a Brooklyn youth in the '70's who radiated around their weekend temple of hedonism, the Disco.SNF works on so many levels that Travolta should easily have won Best Actor for his contribution in his film. SNF was not only a great drama but also a brilliant semi-musical with songs that will last forever.",10,13,18,9 July 2005
The Birth of a Nation," Brilliant historical drama
","Birth of a Nation is one of those rare brilliant films that comes along just a few times in a great long while. It was so magnificently done that even in the 21st century, film-makers are still awed by its' breath-taking style and grand epic inspired perspective.Along with the incredibly well made production comes a history lesson in the Civil War and its' subsequent Reconstruction Period that has been long since banned from public school books and forbidden from rational discussion in historical dialogue.The realities of the barbarism of the Union armies committed against Confederate civilians and the period that followed where White Southerners were denied their civil rights are displayed in the brutality of the era.Griffith's artistic bravery in accurately depicting the KKK as heroes (unlike the degenerates that occupy those roles today) in that time should be applauded. Although I dislike silent films, this film stands as a marvelous achievement and a must viewing for students of film-making and of anyone interested in an accurate perspective of the Civil War and the Reconstruction period.I highly recommend it.",Null,5,13,8 March 2003
Constantine," Scares the Hell out of you
","Just to think that such battles are going on everyday around our lives makes you think that there's a whole other dimension that is fighting tooth and nail for your soul. Your soul is so valuable that a war rages around you fighting for it.If you are an agnostic, surely a film like this would open the door to the possibility of such a conflict. Here's some background information on angels and demons that helps to better understand the motivations of the characters in this film:Satan, the most beautiful angel God ever created, so much wanted to be ruler of the universe that he convinced a third of God's angels to join him in polluting the world God had created.Satan showed these fallen angels the forbidden act of sex. And not with only with humans, but sex with every conceivable animal and insect. Satan promised them pleasure and to make them rulers of the universe. They could have and control whatever they wanted and didn't have to worship God any longer.Satan failed in his mission to became all master and decided in taking it out on mankind, he did everything he could to drive a wedge between God and humanity. For every soul Satan gets, he celebrates and lets his demons (former angels) torment these souls night and day, hurting them in every possible way. Physical and mental pain.God gave us a way out of Satan's tricks but few take the path. Films like Constantine remind us the horror that awaits us all if we choose the wrong path. While Satan is brilliant, he thought that God was sending Mankind's savior on earth and that if he could get the children of Israel to reject this person called 'Jesus', most of the battle would be done and God would have to give up earth to Satan's control where he would own mankind and do with them as he wished.But God is smarter. He knew that there's no way He could send Jesus to earth and allow man's freewill to accept Jesus. It just wasn't going to happen. Satan knows Biblical scripture as well as does God and felt that God was wasting his time.The only chance God had was to allow Jesus to preach the word and and heal the sick and bring back the dead. Satan was ready for that. He drove the Temple Jews to ask the Romans to kill Jesus thus ending this whole problem.But what Satan missed was that Jesus acted as a final sacrifice for all of mankind, forgiving them all of their sins and anytime the people of God sinned, they could call to God for his forgiveness as hi final act of mercy on earth.Satan didn't see this coming and was beyond angry. Now, mankind had a way out and Satan would have to fight a new battle on a new battlefield, making his job much harder. Gone were the silly stupid phoney Gods of Zeus, etc. now he would have to square off with the Son of God himself.The film had a lot of great visuals but veered from the Bible in a number of ways that could easily have been fixed. Gabriel should not have been portrayed in that manner and should have been played as a female. The film is definitely better than the comic book with its' rambling storyline and theological universe. In the comics, Constantine lives in a world where all the gods and their pantheons exist simultaneously.The film-makers came very close to making an excellent film. Nevertheless, it's still scary and I recommend it.",10,3,5,12 February 2006
Lilo & Stitch," Disney at its' very worst!!
","I was shocked at the way the Lilo character was depicted in this sickening film from Disney.First off, Lilo brutally beats a little girl mercilessly simply because she disagrees with her.Then, her older sister jay-walks then kicks a car and throws an insult at the driver for no reason.Next, we see Lilo living in a house of pure filth and her older sister leaves the stove on while she's not at home. It saddened me to see Lilo's older sister threaten violence against Lilo and then Lilo responds with horrid insults against her sister.This is a very disturbing image of what Disney calls 'an alternative family'. This film has absolutely no redeeming value can not teach your child anything about life that he or she couldn't already learn from the gutter.This trash is further evidence why many have boycotted and continue to boycott Disney. Showing this garbage to your child is clearly a form of child abuse and anyone who does so willingly should be arrested and their child put into protective services.",1,9,33,27 January 2003
Cold Mountain," Not a Civil War film
","If someone hadn't told you, you wouldn't know that this was civil war film. We've all come to expect that there would be some battle scenes in a Civil War film yet there was one scene at the start of the film and it was very short.It was basically a war about Southerners who were excited about getting into a war but after a few years decided to desert. Deserters are shot and those deserters are pursued throughout the film for their betrayal of the ideals for which they started this war.Yes, there was some good acting but the film dragged on and had very little action.It wasn't until after I read the reviews about the film that I found out it was made by the same dork that gave us one of the most boring films in history, 'The English Patient'. If I had known about this before renting this film, there's no way I would have rented this clap-trap.If you're in the mood for a mindless, boring, ineffectual film, then this is the film for you.For the love of everything that's holy, don't watch this nonsense.",1,7,13,7 November 2004
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," Utter nonsense
","I would like to know how John Connor and gang got into the Skynet base without clearance? I mean, a military installation that important would be surrounded by hundreds of soldiers. Where were they when Skynet took over? Everybody is getting killed and there are no soldiers anywhere to be found. No security whatsoever.Then, why did Connor leave the base? That's where Skynet is based and they could have just blown up all the mainframes and put a stop to Skynet.I don't even get how Connor gets killed in the future. Does anybody actually understand the circumstances surrounding his death? It was not properly explained.None of this makes sense. It was a poorly made movie and as Cameron said, Terminator is a movie of the 90's. We've seen it all before and if they were going to make a sequel, they should have made one that made sense.
We have all been waiting to see a war between the humans and the machines so why didn't they film the next film in the series back to back so people could actually see what we've been dreaming of seeing, not this nonsense.As much as I did not like this film, I do recommend it to fans of the saga just so they can get another dose of the saga.",4,1,3,28 June 2004
Meet the Fockers," Terrible
",What else can I say? This was just a horribly unfunny film. And they thought that adding Streisand was a brilliant casting move?!! You've got to be kidding. She's just a perverted pathetic one-joke character. What were the writers thinking when they wrote this tripe? Were they that desperate to capitalize on the success of the first film that they threw everything but the kitchen sink at this piece of garbage? There's nothing to see with this film. Ben stiller is naturally funny but everyone else needs serious help. This film was a disgrace and absurd for the other actors.They could have done some fun things with a sequel but instead they chose to pad the film with big name actors in hopes of attracting a bigger audience. The film would have been far better if they had gone with lesser known actors as the Focker parents.,1,4,5,13 November 2005
Caddyshack," Total Classic
","I loved this movie so much that when I was on business in Florida, I went to the golf course where they filmed the movie. I got great pictures of all the major scenes of the film and in the pro shop, I bought a 'Caddyshack' sweatshirt with a gopher on the back. Now, this was back in 1994 and they had changed some things around like the outside restaurant area was now fully enclosed but most everything was intact. Remember the part where Rodney yells at his Asian friend, 'What's with the pictures, it's a parking lot.'? Well, I took pictures of the parking lot as well!!The only thing that saddens me is that the sequel was a crime against humanity.",10,4,8,15 November 2004
8 Mile," Boredom, pure boredom
","You have to be a fan of Enema in order to enjoy this film. I mean, the acting is bad and the flow of the film is slow. You'll find yourself bored very quickly as the film is nothing but repetitive in its' themes and angles.Kim Basinger is an Oscar winning actress and for her to stoop to playing in this film goes to show you how desperate some people are to perform.Lots of screaming, swearing, and 'thug-type behavior' fill this pathetic excuse for a film. Enema pretends to be pro-Gay in his film but we all know that his true feelings regarding gay people is hostile as his words and actions have indicated.I weep for anyone that sat in a theater watching this film and were forced to sit there while being visually attacked with no way out.",Null,1,2,9 October 2004
The Last Samurai," Anti-American film
","Why is it that any film made since 'Dances with Wolves' portrays the U.S. Cavalry as ruthless baby-killers? That's the premise of Tom Cruises character and his hatred of the U.S. is blatant. That premise is utterly ridiculous and ignores the reality of how brutal the American Indian tribes were not only against women and children of Western settlers but also against each other as tribe fought tribe.The film displays some fine acting and a very good foundation of Samurai life and death. There are two battle scenes in the film, both of which are well done. Unfortunately, some of the plot makes no sense and appears to exist merely to display a forum for the characters to display their abilities. **Spoiler: What exactly is wrong with the American proposal?** We don't know because it's not important to the writers to tell us. Well, in the whole context of the film, it is important that we know. Otherwise, what really is the point of this film?While I did not appreciate the anti-Americanism that was displayed through Tom Cruise's character, I do recommend the film on a semi-historical level and some very fine acting. But, please, take the hatred that Cruise's character bears against the U.S. Cavalry with a grain of salt because it's just more anti-American garbage coming out of Hollywood.",1,4,22,7 December 2004
A Night at the Roxbury," The film that defined a generation!!
","I love this film!! It was funny, visually exciting, and the best soundtrack since 'Saturday Night Fever.' In fact this film is similar to 'Saturday Night Fever' in the way that it helped define a part of popular culture.Anyone that is not already going to dance clubs should, first, see this film, second, get to the nearest hot night club and dance to the sounds that were so well presented in this film. I promise, you won't regret it.",10,14,15,14 June 2001
