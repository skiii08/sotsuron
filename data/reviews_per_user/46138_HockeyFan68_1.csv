Miracle," Best movie ever! Definitely my favorite
","Miracle is the story of how the 1980 US Olympic hockey team, a group of young college kids, miraculously defeated the unstoppable Soviets at Lake Placid, and gave their nation, which was going through sifficult times with Cold War tensions and other issues, a chance to beileve in itself. The movie begins with the team being selected, and progresses by showing Coach Herb Brooks pulling the players together to become a team, providing glimpses of exhibition and Olympic games, and culminating with the US-Soviet game, which is meticulously choreographed, where the Americans out-skate their Russian opponents and win a seemingly-impossible victory, and later go on to win the gold medal in ice hockey. Broadcaster Al Michaels' original call, 'Do you believe in miracles?! YES!' is edited in to the movie at the end of the US's victorious game. I would highly recommend this movie to anyone (especially hockey fans), but even if you don't like hockey, you will like this movie.",10,1,2,23 July 2006
