Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Tarantino thought people wanted to see how the story unfolds and not better action. WRONG
","The Kill Bill movies are supposed to be silly and over the top. I get that, and I in some way applaud them for not being serious and going past rules other movies try so hard to follow. After watching Kill Bill 1, I was pretty happy with the movie. It was, well, silly and over the top with a very entertaining action scene. I don't think 2/3 of the movie should have been about trying to kill that Asian chick but whatever. Speaking of which, how come nobody else got a big animated back story? Like Bill's brother could have had a cool back story animated in some kind of western fashion... but whatever. So even tho Kill Bill 1 was silly it was still a fun movie and I enjoyed it.But what the poop is up with Volume 2? I didn't give a darn and a half for the revenge story and none of the action was even half believable. The first one was far fetched too, but come on. Punching your way out of a coffin? Getting shot in the gut and never acknowledge any signs of pain for the rest of the movie? The 5 finger death poke? Now this would all be OK if there was any fun action scenes to go along with it, but dang, the whole thing is them sitting around talking as if Tarantino thought people actually cared about the story. Which was stupid, but hey. It gave a good reason for a bunch of guys to be thrown around a room in the first one. But if you really cared about the story for some dumb reason then by all means go ahead and watch it. But if you hope that the movie is as cool as the first one then you are in for a disappointment. A boring piece of crap.",4,0,2,23 March 2011
