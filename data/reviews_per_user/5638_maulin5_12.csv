Airlift," Airlift will surely touch all Indians by heart!
","As this year has been started well with Wazir, the good work of Bollywood is on the road with increasing the speed and performance. Yes, I'm talking about Akshay Kumar starer Airlift, directed by Raja Krishna Menon, and which is based on true events! Film starts in Kuwait. Rajiv Katyal (Akki) has been reached on the top level in business with his ability. He refers himself as a Kuwait citizen. But when the government leaves their citizens when Iraq attacks on Kuwait under the order of Saddam Hussain, the people becomes needless. Rajiv now feels that he is an Indian, and so along with other 1,70,000 people who are actually Indians but lives in Kuwait, he starts the mission to run from Kuwait as soon as possible. His tries, his communication to India for the help, and the officer's help from India - These things you can find out in this movie. Some factors, like emotions of love for the family, for the nation, for the coworkers and their relatives, for the people who are only belongs to the same nation, have been described very well. Many moments where we can feel patriotism. Raja has directed a superb film. Akshay has given a stunning performance as usual. I was comparing Baby film with this, but both are different. But if you ask for just one movie, than I'll go with this one. Nimrat Kaur is my favorite since The Lunchbox and Dairy Milk commercials. She has delivered a fine supportive job. She shines as a wife of a rich businessman and a caring mother. Kumud Mishra fits absolutely in the character of a government officer. Poorab Kohli has a small role. Supportive cast are fine, too. De Di and Soch Na Sake are very small songs. Perfectly situated. Tu Bhula Jise is the song to remember. Background score suits to the film. Dialogues are good. Nimrat's 3/4 minuets long conversation with a unsatisfied man of the camp who always complains, is a must! Cinematography is good. Some scenes give are shaky, those could have been shoot better. Editing is fine. Indian flag has been waved by an airport staff of Jordan and Akki is watching that, while Tu Bhula Jise song is playing - the scene has been brought so many whistles and shouts. And than one more, in which Air India plane is taking off, while Akki is watching that and in background Vande Mataram is playing - a truly emotional scene! It will surely gives you goosebumps! Overall, a must watch movie for every Indians, to know the largest human evacuation. Salute to all the real heroes! Jai Hind!",9,74,96,22 January 2016
Deadpool 2," Just good, nothing much.
","Marvel is on the roll! After fantastic and super successful Avengers Infinity War, Deadpool is arrived to entertain public. With the solid comic elements, 1st installment of this franchise got fantastic response. And so do we all are expecting with the second edition.Ryan Raynolds as Deadpool is just become a part of X Men trainee. But, as you all know about his mischievousness, he tries to overdo things (to entertain us!) In the meantime, because of the biggest loss in his life, he changes a lot. Tries different things. But as we all know him, he changes accordingly but with the same behaviour. I am not telling anything about the storyline, because it will become spoiler. It is because of the simple story of this part. I have seen it in Hindi. As the first one was super cool in Hindi! Also, every superhero films have to be seen in Hindi language, for the extra amount of humour! As we were thrilled to see 1st part and its comic timing because it was natural and unexpected. Here, the problem is there are only punchlines, nothing else! Too much is also harmful for the cinematic experience. I felt that film and characters are speaking constantly non-sense! Hehehe. Yeah, may be because of poor dubbing. Or even unmatchable Ranveer Singh! There are some moments when the whole theatre split apart. But they were very few moments. Even it was stupid that he saying like Ranveer toh India ka best actor hai! Hahaha... He even tries to promote all his films with SLB! Ufff.... Having said that, I would like to say that usage of old Hindi songs in Hollywood films surely make you smile. Undoubtedly, post credit scene in this part was fantastic. Never seen like this before. I want to write about that part, but have to stop here! Hehe.Some slow motion scenes were fantabulous. But, if you want my honest review, I am not satisfied with this part. This happens many a times that in a franchise, mostly the least part has been the second one! I will put Deadpool in the same category. May be because I have seen it in Hindi, may be because I have seen the ultimate Avengers Infinity War just in last month, or the biggest reason is- May be because I'd seen the first installment just yesterday! These are the assumptions of mine for not getting the feel of Paisa Wasool! May be I am wrong, or may be not!Best scene is jumping from the plane with the entire X-Force team. I am eager to see what will they bring to us in the third part after watching the post credit scene here. So, on the whole, it is just a one time watch film for fans. 3/5.",7,1,4,19 May 2018
Bridge of Spies," No entertainment, just talks!
","A Steven Spielberg movie based on the era of the cold war. The film tells the story of lawyer James, who is entrusted with negotiating the release of Francis, a pilot whose U-2 spy plane was shot down over the Soviet Union & in exchange for Rudolf Abel, a captive Soviet KGB spy held under the custody of the United States. Though the whole film is talkative. No fights, no actions, just chatting. So, many may not like this. I'm in that category. Background score is nowhere in the film, and may be it's a plus point. But, I don't like this kind of a silent movies. So, even after having a good story and a good casts, the film offers no entertainment to me. So I am telling you to skip this. Or watch it if you find the subject interesting!",6,2,5,21 November 2015
Dangal," Bhed Ki Haahakaar Ke Badle Sher Ki Ek Dahaad Hai Pyaare- Dangal!
","Aamir Khan is back after 'pk' as a wrestler who wants his daughter to win the Gold for the nation. It is a biopic of Mahavir Phogat. And believe me, it's a must watch biopic to get inspiration. To achieve something you have to let go the rest of the things.A simple story with great performances make this film a worthy watch. Aamir Khan is as usual fantastic. But, the girls are true heroes of this film. Fatimah who plays Geeta is a sure shot winner. She looks exactly as per her character and delivers great impact as a wrestler. Younger girls of Geeta and Babita are also very fine. Sakshi has a small role, but she plays it safely. Aparshakti Khurana is doing a voice over here and plays a role of the girls' cousin brother. He is funny and entertains the audiences for sure. Girish Kulkarni is also there, who delivered a classy performance in Ugly. So, the star cast and their performances are the biggest point of Dangal.Direction and writing by Nitesh Tiwari are worthy enough for viewers as they don't get bored in any situation. Except one, after interval song, that is like something slow paced. Everyone has to applause him as he gives justice to Phogat's family and doesn't add any extra material which we often see in Bollywood movies. He has delivered the frame as it is, so the middle class viewer can easily be able to connect with the film. What I like the most in the film apart from the performances is Music. Pritam has given it with the lyrics of Amitabh Bhatacharya. Both were amazing in Ae Dil Hai Mushkil. This time also they are killing the stereotypes. I loved all the songs. I'm downloading it. Hanikarak Bapu and Dhakad are pitch perfect. They have some English words as well as some pure Hindi words in them which make them enjoyable. But the best song is by far the Title track in the voice of Daler Mehndi. Full marks to the music department!Yes, it is very emotional film. Those who get the connection easily with films, may cry during some scenes. Even I'm one of them, too. It is better than Sultan, because it's a pure wrestling movie with a family background. Sultan was like a love story with a background of wrestling till interval and then box fighting post interval. I wish, Dangal may cross the record of Sultan at Box Office.On the whole, just go and enjoy the perfect film with your entire family as many time as you can. Btw, I will go for the second time for sure. So, 2016 has ended with a perfect film. Jai Hind!",9,8,11,24 December 2016
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation," My Favorite Franchise, Not the best part, but still a worth watch!
","It's the 5th addition of the superhit franchise. Named as Mission Impossible: Rogue Nation. Starring Tom Cruise in the lead as IMF Agent Ethan Hunt. In the film, Hunt is on the run from the U.S. government as he tries to prove the existence of the Syndicate, an international criminal consortium. The director of the film is Christopher McQuarrie. He has written screenplay, too. The film starts with the plane scene which we had seen in trailer. Then the film just moves on a same pace. Lack of action in before interval portion. But, the Opera show sequence is good enough to engage the viewers. Post interval, there are lot's of action sequences. Especially, the chasing sequence will surely be highly appreciated by MI fans. Those scenes are very very fast and breathless! Underwater scene is also unique and fans will definitely love it. It's little short before interval and slight lengthy in post interval. I'm not saying this is the best part of the series. But, you can't miss this if you love the previous parts. It's a worthy watch. Background score is tremendous. Each and every beat helps my heart to beat little bit more! Cinematography is very good. All have performed really well. Tom looks aged but still able to give a killer look. So, on the whole, I know you are going to watch this, because you've watched all the previous parts, and eagerly excited for this one. So, don't read more reviews, just go for it, and enjoy the show!",9,0,1,8 August 2015
M.S. Dhoni: The Untold Story," So Far The Best Entertainer of this year
","After 3 films with Akshya Kumar as lead, Neeraj Pandey switched over to Sushant Singh Rajput and made this movie based on the life of Indian Cricketer Mahendra Singh Dhoni.First of all, to make a biopic is not an easy job. As what the maker finds interesting, the person on which the biopic is happening may not! He wants something to show, but the maker is not convince with that. These are some basic differences. And after all this, a movie should be a true entertainer. So, the toughest part for the maker is to decide what to show & how to show. Because the maker has to give pure justice to the person's life without hurting his fans and followers.Neeraj starts the film with the 2011 world cup final. And when Dhoni enters in the ground, Neeraj switches of to the flashback. From this point, the film picks up the speed. From the birth of Dhoni, to his schooling, to his relationship with his sister, to his caring mother & strict father, to his friendships, to his matches, to his practice, to his breakdown where he gets to know that he can't play Dulip Trophy, to his disregarding by selectors, to his job as a TC, to his hard work, to his self realization and getting into the train. Every single scene is running like a fast paced balling delivery. The 50% of the film is complete and than you realize that one hour and thirty minutes are over.In post interval, love story starts with Ind-Pak series. Some beautiful tracks and little lighter moments are there in love segments. But as compare to the first half, this is not that much in speed. But you don't feel like boring. And than Sakshi's entry, Dhoni's marriage, and back to the first scene and completes the circle with winning six in the final of 2011 world cup.Lyrics by Manoj Muntshir and Music by Amaal Malik are fantastic. Besabriyaan is my favorite along with the soulful track Kaun Tujhe. The entire album suits to the film. We have noticed in Neeraj's movie, that one background tune which has been constantly played throughout the film. In this movie too, one outstanding tune is there.Anupam Kher, Kumud Mishra, Rajesh & Bhumika are the backbone supporter of this film. Disha Patani looks pretty. Kaira Advani is suitable as Sakshi. Overall a good team in supporter.But the man, Sushant Singh Rajput is a true actor. After delivering a classic performance in last year's Detective Byomkesh Bakshy, he shines out this time too. As a lead, his dedication towards becoming Dhoni is fantastic. From gaining the weight as Dhoni to setting a hairstyle like him, he just delivered his best. His 150 days of cricket training clearly speaks out loud when he strikes the ball with a helicopter shot. He is a real actor of today's generation.Now, what to say about Neeraj! I love all his films. I've seen Baby and Special 26 more than 20 times. And I like this one too. So, whenever I'll get chance, will surely watch this again and again.On the whole, after collecting 20cr on the first day, the movie will fly high at box office. Without any promotions on TV, without any major star casts, this film is doing well, and there are two reasons- Dhoni and Neeraj Pandey. Public is smart and they know on whom they can trust. So, just go and see the film. A pure entertainer of this year. Get inspiration from Dhoni's life and his hard-work.And one more request, please cheer up the hall. As I've seen some snapchat videos where the hall is silent even on the winning stroke. I'm lucky that the hall where I went was so enthusiastic to see this film, that every single stoke of Dhoni or even Gambhir or Yuvraj got applause. Some glimpse of Sachin, Sehwag or any other cricketer also got appreciation by the audience. In my life, I've heard cheers on a six or four in the cinema-hall rather than a stadium. These things made my day. Best movie experience of this year so far.By far, my most favorite biopic film is Bhag Milkha Bhag. And after that, I guess this film.",9,14,22,1 October 2016
Sultan," A one time watch
","Salman Bhai is back on Eid. Last year, he came with a blockbuster movie Bajarangi Bhaijaan. All Non-Salman fans are saying that the movie worked just because of the perfect story and cute little Munni. Bhai's fans were saying Bhai did an outstanding job. Critics said he did a good job not more than that. Yes, I agree with that. But, for this movie, everyone is saying different! A wrestler's love story - This is what Sultan offers. Pre-interval portion is all about flashback love story of Sultan & Arfa with some funny moments, lot's of music, wrestling and emotional touch at the pick of the interval. Post interval, there is fight championship (just like we saw in Brothers!) with Sultan training under Delhi based gym trainer, come back of him in the ring, and emotional ending like a king! Salman did a better job than Bhaijaan. His expressions are so real in the fight scenes. Here Munni is Anushka Sharma. Like Bhai's any previous movies, no heroine got a major part. But, Anushka got, and she performed it really well. Even I can say that she's better than Sultan bhai! Kumud Mishra and Amit Sadh are as good as their roles. Randeep Hooda's guest appearance gets more applause and shouts than Bhai's entry.Cinema-hall creates shouting & cheering three times. First at Bhai's entry, second at Randeep's entry & at the third time, it's Jag Ghumeya song. Best song from this movie is this. Bhai's that dance step is so classic. Other than that, I like peppy song 440 volts, because of it's unique lyrics by Irshad Kamil, Mika Singh's voice and it's choreography and costumes. Personally, I don't like Baby ko bass pasand hai. Sultan's title track is energetic. Others are okay. Music could have been better.So, what's the new thing in Sultan? Well, I can say, Salman in drawers is the only one! Hahaha, jokes apart, yes it's a family film. You can watch it at your suitable ticket price. Anushka's best performance and Salman's fans around your seats never let your enjoyment down. If the show is full, than you can enjoy it, otherwise like what happened to me, that show is only 35% occupied, so a few shouts were heard, and therefore my friend felt the movie was too long. Though, it has not a single boring portion, but, than also, I'm requesting all the masses to shout out in the screen so everyone gets energetic.On the whole, Director Ali Abbas Zafar is playing smart with using Salman, as he wants the promotion! Similarity with YRF's Brothers is still in my mind, so I can't say that this is the best film of this year so far. It's even not better than Bajarangi. So, just a one time watch.",7,2,4,8 July 2016
Jurassic World," Jurassic World is a delight watch for your family!
","We had seen Jurassic Park film series earlier. So, we want more thrill, more variety and more adventures than the previous movies. And this movie surely offers thrills, varieties and adventures in 3D format. If you loved Jurassic Park, or not, you just have to watch this at any cost, because it's worth it. Irrfan Khan is the owner of Jurassic World. His role is bigger than I thought it would be! He is superb as usual. The main hero, Chris Pratt is also acts well and handsome hunk, too. Ty and Nick, two kids, are also good in their respective roles. Their bonding as brothers described well. Heroine is Bryce Dallas Howard and she is pretty and also acts good. Supporting cast is good. Locations and camera-work is undoubtedly too good. In this type of movies, the director's work depends on the camera-work and visual effects. Both are equally good. We can't imagine that the creatures which we are seeing, are fake! Kudos to the team. Some scenes can make you surprise. You can't control yourself for saying Oh, my God! Jumping of the kids in the river is one of those scenes. If you want to be stress-free, tension-free, and want to enjoy your weekend with your family, than this is a delight watch for you. Every single penny of your ticket will recover in this film and its actions. Heart throbbing climax has the best moments of the movie. And make sure you are watching in 3D.",9,24,65,12 June 2015
Happy New Year," A SRK-Farah entertainer for family audience
","After Om Shanti Om, Shah Rukh Khan is back with director Farah Khan to entertain audience. And this time also, they are giving the best entertainer film of the year. The story is not new. It's a revenge story from a son Charlie to his dad's enemy Charan Grover. But in between that, world dance championship has been put to add some songs, some action sequences and background plot of the film HNY. Director Farah Khan once again proved that the masala films are actually her part of business to attract masses. I think Main Hoon Na was the first Masala family entertainer. Than OSO has been released. After that she made Tees Mar Khan with Akki, which was a disaster. So, she made her 4th movie with SRK and again she made a complete entertainer. Although the film is 179 minutes long, but, SRK fans don't need to worry because not a single minute is here to bore you, even in the end titles, the casts and crews can make you smile till the end. Dipika looks stunning in Lovely song. Everyone is whistling in that song. She is as usual. Vivan looks cute. Sonu Sood has limited scope but than also he entertains. Boman is also fantastic and funny, too. Abhishek may get the best comedian role award for this year. I liked him so much. Jacki is also suitable to his role. Anupam Kher, Sajid Khan, Maliaka Arora Khan, Dino, Vishal, Anurag Kashyap, Prabhu Deva & Kiku Sharda as Faroj Khan did the cameo roles, which are the funny sides of the movie. I was laughing very loudly in the Prabhu-Kiku cameo scene, I loved that. SRK is a baap of expression. He can use his voice only to show or express the situation. He has given the best. His entry scene is very well captured. Whistlings and shouting may happen in every theater for sure. No doubt in the direction. But I feel, the editing could have been sharp. So the film gets appreciation from the haters of SRK also. But, the length is giving the chance to the haters to drag the film to a flop. But, this is a super-hit movie, a bollywood entertainer which is released after a long time. Music suits the motion of the film. Manwa Laage, Satkali, Indiawaale, Nonsense ki night - all the songs are well sung. Music is given by Vishal-Shekhar. Irshad Kamil proved once again that he is the best lyricist after Gulzar & Javed, who can write soulful songs as well as tapori and dancing songs with such a beautiful lyrics. Indiawale is the example. Dialogues by Mayur Puri are fine, but, the situations are more funnier than the dialogues. Farah and Geeta Kapoor are the choreographer and they did well. On the whole, if you want the Diwali gift, if you are a fan of OmShantiOm & MainHoonNa, if you like masala movies, if you love Dubai, if you like to watch film with whole family - Than go for it. Happy New Year is a complete paisa wasul movie. Fingers cross for 300cr.",7,9,19,24 October 2014
Deadpool," One more superhero is in the market!
","Another mutant has been created by Marvel, called Deadpool. Because of the last stage of cancer, the hero, Wilson agrees to to an experiment which can survive him so that he can live a life with his love. But, experiment goes wrong and though he becomes a mutant but his skin becomes very ugly. So, he plans to find Francis who can solve the problem of his skin. But, Francis is also a mutant, so the battle between the hero and the villain begins. And this is the story of this film! Comedy is super cool. Film looks like a pure paisa-wasool masala. It has all double meaning dialogues, and in Hindi, they are just too good. We can feel that these are our own! Two X-Men characters are there, too. Not more, because of the producer's limited budget! Hehe!Very sharp editing and some scenes are fantastically made with the use of graphics. And don't forget to watch the teaser of the second part in the end, after the end credits. Believe me, it is really funny.So, one more superhero is in the market. This movie is creating records and collecting money. Sequels will be definitely made. Let's see how long will it go!",8,3,12,19 February 2016
Spectre," Action-packed Bond is back!
","Daniel Craig in and as James Bond 007, directed by Sam Mendes. This time it's personal! The story of Bond and his brother. The continuation from Skyfall. Starts in Mexico, where the terrific Helicopter scene has been shown. Truly amazing, as I've never seen like this before on screen. From where Bond gets the signal of the main villain, which actually is his brother. His entry scene is very unusual. Dave Bautista is a surprise package. The chasing in snow is off to mark. Basically, besides story, which is a good point, we only want to see more and more action sequences. Thus, Spectre is able to provide it. So, fans will surely like this. Cinematography is a major plus point. But, the first thing which can affect you is the original music by Thomas Newman. Every single bit of every situation can able to give you the thrill which is required in a thriller. Kudos to him! Daniel's last appearance as Bond is remarkable. He's better than what he's in Skyfall. Christoph Waltz is impressive as a villain. Ben is always a fun to watch as Q. The new Bond girl, Léa Seydoux looks sexy. I'm disappoint with CBFC, as some scenes had been cut, and because of that, no charm left in those scenes. I can call it an immature behavior. So, all the Bond fans, just go for it, you wouldn't miss this one, as may be this is the last movie of Craig as Bond.",9,0,4,21 November 2015
Furious 7," One Last Ride Dedicated To Paul Walker... Action-Packed!
","Paul Walker's last movie, the seventh installment of the hit series of Fast and Furious. In every part, you can find mind blowing stunts and action sequences. Somehow, they are illogical, but, can give entertainment. And that's the reason this series is popular in youngsters basically who love cars, cash and girls! This is the sequel of its last part, though it is connected with Tokyo Drift, too. Jason Stathom becomes the villain in this part. Whenever he enters to the screen, the crowd shouts and give him a roaring welcome every time. Vin Diesel and Paul Walker and their team, are ready to finish Jason and one other villain who is behind the hacker girl. Team has to save the girl and take the revenge of the death of their teammate. This is the storyline, and it is full of action scenes. Director James Wan did a quiet good job. I think this is probably the best part of these series. 15 minutes before interval will blow your mind, and it will be refund of your ticket. The car scene jumping from one to another building in Abu Dhabi is also marvelous. The fight scenes between Vin-Jason and Paul- are just fantastic. It's cool for Ali Fazal to do a small role in this movie. This will help him in more Hollywood projects. Everyone knows that Paul Walker is no more. Some portions has been shoot using his body double, particularly his brother. Though, it is the last ride, in the end, Paul Walker's journey in this series has been displayed. Dialogues of that frame have been written beautifully. Some spectators started clapping in those frames. The film is dedicated to Paul, and that's why, the last line on the screen was 'For Paul'. Go for it in 3D. It is worthy. You can not dare to miss this as a FF series fan!",8,2,6,2 April 2015
