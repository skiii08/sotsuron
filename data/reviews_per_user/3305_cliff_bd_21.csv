First Man," I understand what the movie was trying to achieve but....OMG it was so boring
",I really liked the idea and I kinda liked the movie but I found it to be disjointed and slow...... I loved the part of the movie when Neil Armstrong was on the Moon and he dropped his dead daughters braclet into the crater .... to let her goThe rest of the movie was good and at times challenging to watch....,4,226,373,23 October 2018
It," Good movie, especially when compared to the 1990 version
","***May Contain Spoilers*** I liked IT. I read the book in the late 1980s and compared to some other inferior Stephen King book to film interpretations it was surprisingly good. For example, The Tommyknockers, was a truly poor movie, there are many other to discuss, but for for me this one was the worst. Obviously there are a few memorable movies such as the Shawshank Redemption, which for me was the best.So why do the Stephen King book to film interpretations hit so issues and cause so many negative comments in the IMDb reviews? It is because the Stephen King books are very complex both in story and in character development - Hollywood are in 'most' cases extremely poor when translating such stories and characters; preferring to keep things very simple (and predictable for the audience) and is so doing, heavily watering down the content until there is little or none of the original rich tapestry of the story and characters remaining.I was surprised that a remake of 'IT' was made considering how bad the original TV movie version was in 1990. It was a poor movie due to the reasons I have listed above.But being an eternal optimist I went to see the movie, and I was pleasantly surprised. Was it perfect? Absolutely NOT - and parts of the story was omitted again due to the reasons listed above. Having said that the movie tried to remain faithful to the book, it least as much Hollywood would allow the film makers.I am looking forward to 2nd part with some concern: The 1990 version completely destroyed the cross over between the teenage characters and the adult characters and I had to push myself to continue to watch through to the end. The end of the movie was just a total let down.In the book, it revealed the true nature of IT and explained that what the adults saw, was only what the human mind could accept seeing I.E what IT actually was, was something truly terrible and beyond human comprehensionTherefore I am hoping that Part 2 of IT 2017, will be true to the book (well.....as much as Hollywood will allow).",7,4,8,16 September 2017
Star Trek," The best stek trek since the original series
","I loved this Star Trek reboot - its what star trek is all about and the best Star Trek movie since Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home . Forget about the next generation movies which were a complete yawn-a-thon.I had lost faith that the Star Trek would ever again produce the a decent movie again.When I look back at Star Trek Generations, Insurrection and Nemesis they make me shudder... and were all a complete waste of my time at the movie theaterDon't get me wrong I love star trek .... just the story writers for TNG, need to be let go",10,3,11,26 September 2018
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," Well its says Star Wars in the title.........
","*****Spoiler Alert..........First Rogue One is a good movie....... but is it really part of the Stars Wars franchise? Well its says Star Wars in the title.........In short the first 30 minutes of the movie is really slow and had little to do with the Star Wars, the next hour is a little better and the last 20 minutes, the movie kinda of remembered it was a Star Wars movie and it was great through to the end.The comedy elements are there with a good performance from Donnie Yen and K-2SO was funny. The scene with Darth Vader at the end of the movie was great.As I say Rogue One IS a good movie ...... but a classic Star Wars movie - it is not",6,5,11,17 December 2016
Aquaman," Predictable story.....but still great fun
","I really enjoyed Aquaman......... sure the story was predictable..... but the movie is great fun and does not take itself too seriously.If I was to compare Aquaman to Black Pather and Antman and Wasp, I would say (in my opinion) that Aquaman is the superior movie. (See my Black Pather review).It has to be said that the Marvel and DC films story lines are predictable..... it's the characters and heart and of course action and pace of the movie that makes them.Aquaman characters are fun, the pace of the movie is fast moving and unrelentingThe measure I normally use is when I watch a movie for a second time, does it still hold my interest? For me, although I liked Black Pather the first time round ...... it did not hold my interest the send time.Anyway Aquaman is just a fun movie, don't take it too seriously and you will probably enjoy it.",9,5,9,15 December 2018
X-Men," Good effects and action but terrible story
","The X-Men movies for me have always been a disappointment. I love the X-Men and the Marvel / DC Universes however, the story lines for the movies always left me somewhat cold.The storylines were 2 dimensional and basically lacking any depth.I am all for making improvements when transitioning from comic book to cartoon to big screen movie - however the storylines in the cartoons had more depth and interest then the movies.OK maybe there are limitations when transitioning from cartoons to big screen movies I get that - but there is no excuse when the film makers tone down and over simplify the storylines or in the case of the X-Men change the storylines completely into something that just lacks substance.",4,0,2,28 January 2019
Spider-Man: Homecoming," Teen Spiderman....... really?
","**** Spoilers ****** Prior to Spider man Home Coming there were 5 Spider man movies, 3 with Tobey Maguire and 2 with Andrew Garfield. Although I liked the Maguire movies they were a 55 / 45 split between Peter Parker's failing relationship and Spider man story and at times the emotional failing relationship aspect of the movies became too over powering and the became main focus of the movies.Andrew Garfield's Spider man was more well balanced and although the movies did explore the Girl Friend /Parker / Spider man relationship struggle, it allowed the Spider man story to be a little more center stage.... and for the record had a much better story explaining how Peter Parker actually became Spider Man....So when it was announced that a sixth Spider man movie my first thought was ....why? I liked the fact that the film makers did not go back to the beginning to explain how Peter Parker became Spider Man because that did not need to be revisited. I liked Micheal Keaton's, Jon Favreau and Robert Downey Jr. characters... but it was down hill from there.In my view Tom Holland's Spider man is the weakest version of the 3 Spider man movie versions and in parts it was very slow ... the movie did not need to be made.Tom Holland's character was written like some (pre) teen movie and it was embarrassing to watch and not only that .... he spent the whole movie crying about not being listened to and wanting to be an Avenger ...but at the end of the movie he turns the offer to be part of the Avengers down..... this is just so predictable it was painful.Great for kids 12 years or younger I guess..... and this would explain why the movie made such a huge amount of money in the opening weekend... The whole family going to the movie theater rather than just couples. I not saying that is a bad thing, in fact its a good thing!.... but in my view the quality of the movie is the main priority of movie making",5,7,11,13 July 2017
Aladdin," Not one of Guy Ritchie better films
","I liked the fact that this movie was a remake of the original cartoon version from 1992.But. There are several problems with this movie....... firstly pace of the movie was too slow especially the first 30 minutes. Secondly the casting the actor that played the villain Jaffar had no dark charisma or humour ..... also... Will Smith made a good effort in the role, but ultimately failed, he did not carry the humour the role needed and lets face it he had some pretty big shoes to fill ...... Robin Williams was just so great in the 1992 cartoon version. As a result the movie just missed that zing or soul.I really like the magic carpet..... that really captured the essence from the 1992 version.But overall the movie was OK but not great.I was waiting for the movie to finish and was happy when the movie ended",2,29,49,26 May 2019
A Quiet Place," I loved the idea.......But.....
","Firstly I thought the general idea and concept of the film was great and the edge of the seat experience was excellent.... some truly jumpy moments through out the film.However, in between the tense moments the film was slow and at times frustrating. That I can forgive....... but what I cannot forgive at the following points:1. Letting the Youngest child run around a store full of things that they are just going to knock over and make a noise
2. Leaving the batteries of the toy rocket on the side is easy reach of the child 
3. When walk home allow the youngest child bring up the rear and walk at the back..... are they crazy!!
4. Knowing that they are safer next to a river and even safer next to a waterfall but they live miles away!!The list goes on and on ..... I am sure others who have written reviews have written all the gaps and issue in detail so I wont list them all out.But just one more point...... if you were being attacked by blind monsters who have super hearing ..... I would think that sound would be their weakness.... but the film spends the entire 90 minutes to delivery this revelation!! So great concept but the film really could have been SO much better",6,1,2,12 May 2018
X-Men: Apocalypse," I wanted to like it
","I paid my money and went to see X-MEN: Apocalypse. I am an eternal optimist and although I was terribly disappointed with the first 2 Bryan Singer X-MEN movies (I mean... character re-write of Rogue was criminal). I thought maybe he would get it right this time. Unfortunately, my optimism was not repaid and the movie was again disappointing. In my opinion the problem is the stories, then are just so bland which is a direct result of the Bryan Singer re-writes from the original X-Men stories, which were awesome. BUT... Bryan Singer does not limit his poor quality story telling to the X-Men movies - No! Just look at the awful Superman returns movie from 2006. This was the pinnacle of boredom and was the worst superman story I have ever had the misfortune to watch. Maybe Hollywood is happy to throw money at poor quality stories at the expense of CGI and special effects but the paying public (I hope) will not tolerate this forever. I will avoid movies directed by Bryan Singer going forward....",4,9,20,30 May 2016
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," A pale and poor imitation of the original and great Star Wars movies
","**** Contains Spoilers ****The Force Awakens and the Last Jedi are a messy mix of a new story line interwoven with the underlying original story. The result is weak movies which are only held up by the Star Wars legacy that so many millions of people around the world love. This is the only reason that the movie is and will become a huge box office hit.Luke Skywalker has been written as a weak and beaten character, which is a travesty. The film makers would have produced a far superior movie by using the Alan Dean Foster story Jedi Academy.There are no memorable characters in the movie, this is not the fault of the actors - this is 100% the responsibility of the director and the Writers - and Guess what they are one and the same person.Kylo Ren is not in the same league as a bad guy as Darth Vader..., and Is just a kid with daddy issues.The last Jedi is terrible compared to both the original and the prequel Star Wars moviesBut hey I am a die hard Star Wars fan and yes I went to the movie theatre to watch it - if you like me do go to watch the movie, be prepared for a huge disappointment.",4,0,0,19 December 2017
Logan," X-Men or not X-Men
","After seeing this movie I found myself myself torn between 2 views: (1) On the one hand the movie was good and kept me engaged throughout (2) On the other, I felt the X-Men / Wolverine story was ripped up and thrown away; basically this was not an X-Men / Wolverine movie.If I look at the movie purely on its own merits, the movie is very good. The movie builds its characters well, fight sequences are great and acting is good. If I look at the movie as a Marvel/X-Men movie, it left me feeling cold, although its still better then the previous Wolverine movie (not difficult)The Wolverine and X-Men movies have always had a basic problem and have always failed to produce a story line woven into the X-Men comic/cartoon history. They have always deviated from the core story lines, no doubt the film makers thought that this would improve the film experience, however, they have always fallen short of the mark.So yes Logan is a good movie but should be kept as a separate movie from the Marvel/Wolverine franchise and viewed strictly as a spin off",6,1,8,4 March 2017
The Shape of Water," Well produced movie .. but slow and boring
","This movie received several Oscars this year. Well I feel that I deserve an Oscar for sitting through this movie.Don't get me wrong the movie is well made. But for me a great movie (whatever the Genre maybe) must connect and captivate the person watching the movie. This Movie failed in this respect as I was looking at my watch through out hoping the movie would end.The other point to note about the Shape if Water, is that there are too many parallels with M Night Shyamalan's Lady In The Water (another adult farye tale and a movie which was ambitious but failed to deliver).
(1) the story is Centered around a being who lives in the water
(3) the water dwelling being is being hunted and is in need of protection
(2) the main character has a speech impediment 
..... the list goes onThe last point about this movie that did not sit well with me is the year the movie is set in - 1962 .... I found myself repeatedly asking the question why is the movie set in this year and why is there such a focus on the music of the era.... I mean it is almost pushed down our throats there is so much of it. In my view the only reason the movie was set in 1962 was to try and set the movie apart from other movies of similar themes, one of which I mentioned earlier in this review.So why did this movie win so many Oscars? I will leave you to ponder that question yourself",4,12,27,13 March 2018
It Chapter Two," A solid and very entertaining follow up
","I really enjoyed IT part 1 and Part 2, there was more humour in Part 2 which for me is why I think Part 2 is better.But irrespective of whether you prefer part 1 or part 2 the film as a whole was a really great adaptation of a complex novel by stephen King.Part 2 was well paced and the laughs and screams was echoed throughout the movie theatre.My only critique is the ending, and I know that many other reviewers has mentioned this. I have to given the high quality of the rest of the movie the makers could made a better ending..... and both the TV adaptation with Tim Curry and the big screen versions shyed away from the ending in the book which was disappointing but admittedly probably difficult to pull off.Anyway apart my gripe about the ending, my Wife and I thoroughly enjoyed IT Part 2.... this was not just a 2 dimensional horror movie, it had depth and the script in terms of the character interaction and casting was Top notch.IT part 2 really shows that horror movies can be more than just cheap jumps and shocks..... and I can finally forgive Stephen King for the terrible 90's TV adaptation of the Tommy Knockers!!",9,2,3,14 September 2019
Murder on the Orient Express," Why.....?
","I gave this movie a 5 out of 10 purely because I love Agatha Christie stories.I agree with many other reviewers that this remake was unnecessary, specially when they are so many wonderful Agatha Christie stories that have not made the big screen.As for Poirot, there is no way that the Poirot character could ever bear that huge and messy mustache, he would be trimming it down to small detail.Don't get me wrong I think that Kenneth Branagh is a fine actor and director... he has just dropped the ball with this film.David Suchet was and always will be the best Poirot. He lived the role for 25 years.",5,18,36,23 November 2017
Wonder Woman," OK film but it sags in the middle
","*****some Spoilers*****I liked the Wonder Women movie... but I give it 6 out of 10The not so good: The movie spent too long focusing on Diana's Amazon origins... This would not have been an issue but the story line was tedious. The usual she/he will have to find out the true nature of her abilities themselves story ... its been done before to death so many times. It got a bit draggy and I actually got up to go to the toilet during the movie... I NEVER do that in the Cinema.. and when I got back to my seat I did not miss anythingThe huge leap between Diana not knowing her true abilities and then jumping up a high tower or running in front of the German machine guns was kinda laughable there was no middle ground or 'oh actually I AM the daughter or Zeus, hey this is what I can do!!'The good: The actions scenes were great the humour was OK and the characters were OK the CGI was goodI am a fan but these things have to be saidI am looking forward to the Justice League - I think Wonder Women will be great again in that movie ...as she was in Batman vs Superman",3,2,10,3 June 2017
Black Panther," Good action movie let down by a poor story.....again
","****Spoiler Alert ***** DO NOT read if you don't want to know the story line! Black Panther had loads of potential, mainly due to the fact that the Super hero was not from America. I'm not saying that I don't like Super heroes from America, I do and I love them, however, the with BP film makers had a different back story to work with and had a real opportunity to produce something really creative and really different within the Marvel Universe; but did they? .....No!The story writers kept the film within a safe and regularly used story line frame work. Here's the frame work:
1. The parent (mother or Father) keeps some dark secret from the the son/daughter.
2. The parents(s) wanted to tell their off spring but never did, due to either dying or being killed earlier than they anticipated.
3. Throw in some dangerous element or threat or villain.... in this case the metal Vibranium which some bad guys are after and fill a portion of the film with chase scenes and explosions.
4. Then go back to the dark secret... in this case the father killed the brother and left the brothers son in American
5. The brothers son grows up vowing to take his bitter revenge.
5. The bitter revenge is then taken by the son and tries to kill our hero in this case its BP. Everyone thinks hes dead ....but hes not!! (Surprise!!)
6. Our hero (BP) goes to a his life time enemies (in this case the Ape tribe in Wakanda) to asks them for help (the life time rivalry could be a rival gang or child friend who he/she fell out with due a fight over a girl or money... in this case its the Vibranium)
7. The life time enemies say No, No way will I ever help you!!....... But guess what they come to save the day, just in the nick of time....
8. They all live happily ever after!Hollywood on occasion put movies that breaks the above framework and other similar frameworks... but it is rare and Black Panther is most certainly not one of the exceptions and unfortunately, has its fundamental story line built solidly within the framework.Did I like the movie, Yes. Did I love the movie, 'almost'.... I love Marvel and DC (Ok ... I'm a sucker for the genre)My Point is this - Hollywood spends billions developing CGI and non CGI special effects ever year - it is high time that they start investing the same time and effort to create a rich and original story line that justifies the budget of the movie",6,30,65,19 February 2018
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Great movie
","OK - this is a super hero movie so I don't take it overly seriously, but I want to be entertained.I was not disappointed ...good story, good acting the movie moved forward at an acceptable rate and did not drag or get boring.The movie did not try to justify itself and just pushed it out there - why should a movie have to send a lesson about how we can be better? As I say this was a super hero movie and it has lots of action and was very dark ... I loved it!I think the people who gave this movie a bad review, must have been watching X-MEN apocalypse",8,4,11,31 May 2016
Godzilla," Really Really disappointing
","*contains spoilers*I wanted to like the movie as I had been looking forward to it for several weeks.First off the CGI is impressive, fantastic Godzilla and MUTO monsters, 10 out of 10 for the monsters!However, the pace of the movie was too slow and the beginning of the movie really could be cut out without impactThe character development simply did not work and failed leaving me with no connection to them what so ever. The only character with a little depth was Dr. Ichiro Serizawa (Ken Watanabe)The movie was structured to focus on the characters rather than the monsters, but because the character development was so poor it completely failed; for example when Godzilla and the MUTO started to fight the movie switched several times to one of the characters either watching the monsters on television or a similar scenario. Actually, this was a really clever idea but it failed because I just didn't care about the one dimensional characters and was begging for the movie to switch back to the monster fight scenes.....which didn't happenAnd don't get me started on the Admiral, David Strathairn is a fine actor , but I was really beginning to think he didn't realise he was in the Godzilla movie.....no passion, not tension, no suspense, no frustration from the character he playedThe person sitting next to me in the Cinema started using his Iphone, half way through the move, normally I would ask the person to switch it off, but I felt the same ....boredWhat is it about Godzilla movies? The movie back in 1998 failed as the casting was terrible but at least it tried to create characters and tried to build excitement and suspense. This movie should have been and had the potential to be great..... but it left me feeling really really disappointed",5,5,10,17 May 2014
Life," Remake of Quatermass?
","*******Contains spoilers****I found this movie extremely frustrating and predictable. I am amazed that Ryan Reynolds agreed to be in the movie. However, Reynolds part in the movie was relatively small as he was the first to be killed off, I can only assume he requested this.The movie is about discovering a life form on another planet (in this case Mars) and bringing it back to Earth orbit in a space station .. it is similar to the Quatermass story in this regardThe frustrating part of the movie is, astronauts cannot are really this stupid, if they are, then mankind has no future in space.... let me explain.Firstly, the film repeatedly talks about the 'firewalls' and the importance of quarantine. But shortly after the life form has been discovered and starts growing at an extremely alarming rate (alarm bells!!), the life form expert (Ariyon Bakare) makes a silly mistake, does not follow protocol and puts the whole crew at risk. Ryan Reynolds than charges into the quarantine area to fix the issue.Secondly, they have discovered a life form, which is the first ever positive confirmation that life exists outside of Earth. So what do they do? They electrocute the life form and then wonder why it starts attacking the crew (or defending itself?)Thirdly, after they electrocute the life form and it starts showing a aggressive reaction (surprise!) the life form expert (Ariyon Bakare) is attacked and falls unconscious. Reynolds character (again) charges into the quarantine area and pushes the unconscious Ariyon Bakare out. This results in Reynolds being told by Rebecca Ferguson character, 'you can't come out!!' Why was allowed to enter the quarantine area in the first place?? – this takes me neatly back to my first sentence of this review......Exit Reynolds :)Fourthly, this worst part of the movie is when the third 'firewall' kicks in, which is a ship sent from Earth to push the space station into deep space to stop the life from reaching Earth. The scenes during this part of the movie are ridiculously confusing. Basically Hiroyuki Sanada character tries to get into the ship to escape, and this results in the ship breaking up and pushes to space station back into Earth Orbit. .. Great job of protecting humanity guys!!The rest of the movie continues on this downward spiral of silly mistakes an amateur astronaut would avoid doing and in the end the life form gets back to Earth (Surprise!! (again)) after a totally ridiculous scene where the last 2 survivors jump into escape pods (and again) completely mess up, sending the alien back to Earth while the escape pods that was supposed to go Earth is pushed out into deep space with Rebecca Ferguson's character in it!I came out of the movie theatre feeling cheated this is 104 minutes of my life I will never get backAvoid this movie at all costs",4,7,15,23 March 2017
Alien: Covenant," Makes Alien Resurrection look good
","***Contains spoilers***** Alien Covenant........... where to start......Firstly like everyone else who took time to write a review I was eagerly awaiting to see Alien Covenant.I went to the Movie Theater and after the movie finished, I came out feeling cold.God knows Prometheus was not perfect - but it least it left the audience asking many questions and there was the mystery around the who the engineers were, and why they wanted to kill off the human race with the virus and many other questions.So I was eagerly awaiting to see a movie with a great story that would answer at least some of the questions..... but what did we get? A synthetic (Android) with Daddy complex, who flew back to the engineers planet and wiped them out by using the virus on them.The Alien was more of a side story wrapped around the twist that it was the Android who worked on the virus to perfect the Alien form.I'm sorry but this is lazy writing and boring. This is not a return to form and in many ways Prometheus is superior to Covenant.The film is any other context would have been good (which is why I gave the movie a reluctant 6) - but for a Ridley Scott Alien movie.... it is not good enough and for me has destroyed the mystery behind where the Alien came from.Some people are saying that the film makers have once last chance left to redeem themselves in the final part of the Trilogy to be released in 2019 - but for me I cannot see that happening and I have lost faith in the Alien Prequel Franchise - Even worse the end of Alien Covenant sets up the Synthetic (Michael) to continue as a central character/theme of the final of the Trilogy. Come on!! What about the engineers? what about the Alien??? Hmmmm.... what to do now...? I will watch Alien Resurrection, maybe that will cheer me up!!",5,6,14,15 May 2017
