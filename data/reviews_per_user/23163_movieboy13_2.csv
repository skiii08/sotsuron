The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," From someone who finds the books overrated and hates the tween fandom, this movie is an astonishing surprise
","I have a love hate relationship with the Hunger Games series. I thought the first book was overrated and the first movie was a piece of garbage. I thought the second book was surprisingly well written and the movie was excellent. I thought the last book was fine and the ending was just awful. Although I like things about the Hunger Games, I was also very reluctant (and still kind of am in a way) to buy into the whole series. Although I liked the second movie, I was really reluctant to see the new Hunger Games movie. For some reason I just do not like the legions of fans and the hype it generates. I kind of feel like a hypocrite here, but I really cannot deny the excellence of The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part One. There is all this dreck geared towards teens likes Divergent and Vampire Academy, etc. If you are one of those people (you know who you are) who always says all of these movies are terrible (as they are) and wish that teens and audiences alike were treated with more respect by Hollywood, here is your movie. This movie depends on not much action action and virtually no dumb relationships but on human interaction, startlingly mature and graphic content, and the surprisingly realistic depiction of revolution through quiet and subtle direction from Francis Lawrence. Whereas the Hunger Games themselves were the driving force of the other movies, this movie takes a lot time and has a more adult approach to material and it is hardly boring, in fact it is engrossing. I was hooked from beginning to end. Talk about a chilling ending brrrrr.It delivers on every level. Media goddess Jennifer Lawerence does not ham it up with a freakout scene and does a great job. Phillip Seymour Hoffman (sadly in his last role) gives a really solid performance along as does the usually annoying Julianne Moore. In fact, everyone in the film is in top form. Also, how could you not love how intensely over-the-top evil Donald Sutherland is? Screenplay is great, directing is great, special effects is great, cinematography is great, shall I go on? This movie is just a great surprise. This movie is thought provoking, disturbing, and not completely crowd pleasing and that is part of why it is really great. Regardless of my liking of the second movie, the first and second Hunger Game movies were still seen by tweens saying, 'Is it Peeta or Gale? Who does she love. oooooooo!!!!!', yet this is just a great film on it's own. I cannot say it enough times. I applaud this movie for blowing my expectations out of the water and delivering what may be one of this year's best film's. Movies like this and Dawn of The Planet of The Apes are proof that Hollywood is able to produce well-made and intelligent films. Please explain Transformers 4 then?Sadly, this film is like Harry Potter and The Deathly Hallows and Part Two is just a bloodbath. Will not be as well made and emotional (maybe I am getting to pretentious here), but whatever, but I am glad I saw this and I absolutely recommend it.",8,23,60,23 November 2014
Rise of the Planet of the Apes," An incredibly pleasant surprise
","This movie is great. It truly is. Even though many people like it, I still don't think it gets enough praise. It is the third reboot of The Planet of The Apes series and it not only breaths new life into the series, but it has an incredibly interesting social message.It's entertaining, very menacing, fun, and sad all at the same time. A great combinationThe acting from James Franco and Freido Pinto are solid and John Lithgow is very memorable. Andy Serkis sets the standard for motion capture acting and is amazing. This is a short review, but this movie has so much too offer and is just great on every level. See this movie and it's sequel. Equally great.",9,1,4,12 July 2014
