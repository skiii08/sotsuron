The Devil's Advocate," A true gem of 90's...that is now getting its due
","Why this movie was never widely appreciated is quite a mystery to me. Must be just ahead of its time. It never got on my radar I had a chance to see it on a rare slow evening ....and it is a stunning, rare experience. If you have not seen it --ignore all the negative reviews--just get ready for a fantastic ride. It is not what you expect but no short-cut in story telling is taken. It is a thinking man's thriller, with an exceptional cast. This movie would not be same without Keanu, Theron, and Pacino. The acting is first-rate and they sell you the story the old-fashioned way. A thrilling ride that pick's up pace and reaches a logical but slightly drawn out conclusion....It is a long movie but it allows for complex theme of evil and how it manipulates the gullible is developed .,...but gullible (s) are not just plain and passive people---they have a complex psyche and their own strengths and reasons. All comes together spectacularly.The movie is also great visually but it never overwhelms you with dominating special effects. I hope some day the smart folks in Hollywood realize (or develops more faith)--- that the biggest special effect of all is the face, tone, and mannerism of an actor..yes it is called ACTING...so mesmerizing that it make you forget the celluloid screen and you believe and get invested in the character completely. This is why Casablanca can still give you a bittersweet feeling even more than five decades later and any product from (Master) Ingmar Bergman makes thinking during the movie easy and so pleasurable.",Null,1,2,12 October 2017
Blade Runner 2049," The best science fiction release since Matrix--a true masterpiece!
","I saw it for the first time only recently after skipping it for a few months after its release and all the hoopla has quieted down. If I find this movie in an IMAX near me I will go and see it again in a heartbeat-- but that is unlikely and still do not regret it. Marketing surrounding its release may have misaligned expectations that led to somewhat poor word of mouth from puzzled early movie goers. Understandable--this is a hard movie to market--It would have been hard to like this movie (even for many cerebral moviegoers) when expectations were shaped of a typical summer blockbuster that service a transient entertainment. A la generic superhero move entertainment that is so common these days...a sort of fast food experience....you know what you expect, you know the feeling when the movie ends and you know you will forget it in a minute). It you do not get this the reaction is usually negative. And this is from someone who actually thought Thanos focused infinity wars was a much superior movie and as entertaining as the first Iron Man. Anyhow those movies along with many other Marvel/DC releases are (as empty as they are) happen to be cash machines and have their place but they are not in the same league as the BR2049 or the Matrix in my humble opinion.This movie is a great mystery that develops the character Arc of Gosling's through the movie just as Matrix was about Neo's arc. No spoilers here but it is important to make it clear that there is no similarity in their character. My emphasis is on the 'development arc'. And therefore in both the movies the payoff is great and it should sustain even when the special effects (eventually) will get dated. This is why Shakespeare is so enduring. It is a drama. The genius of Matrix was that it was about the character of Neo and how he is shaped by and shapes his immediate world and how he becomes aware of his capabilities as the movie progresses through some amazing set pieces. Without going into details/spoilers for others like myself who avoided this masterpiece so far-- suffice to say the Blade Runner is about Goslings discover of himself --who is he really? and Because of the sensitivity of this topic and the higher complexity of his character (compared to Neo) the run time is very much justified (it is ok for one to stop the movie for a day in between if needed as the movie pacing takes time to get used to--it is still enriching). But even when Gosling's character is silent pay attention to his superhuman sense of hearing, ultrafast processing of information, assessing his options and choosing the next step. His actions, small walks in the same scene, mannerisms are anything but random. He is almost so fast that even in physical dangers which are sudden it is hard to rattle him or surprise him. When you follow the movie through his experiences the run time actually feels short. Yes. And unlike Neo there is much less help for him...he has to fight the danger and simultaneously discover himself, process his emotions after the knowledge mostly on his own. Of course Joi serves as his love interest as well as doubles as Lawrence Fishburn-like character that actually hints at his capabilities. Their interaction is genius and the chemistry between the two --laconic Gosling and expressive Joi is something to behold. You buy his love for this virtual marvel. Big credit to both for delivering on this.
Similarly other two unforgettable characters are Luv and Harrison Ford Deckard. Luv is an amazing, ruthless, and certainly fearsome villain. She sells the stakes against Gosling's character effortlessly. Ford's Deckard is an incredible tour de force. He chews up scenery and has not lost any of his charisma...There is a reason Ford is an iconic star--pay attention to his cryptic answer and mannerism when Gosling asks whether the dog is real--- he elevates this simple exchange the only way he can. 
There are some flaws as they are bound to be in such a complex enterprise but I think they do not distract from the pleasure of this movie. Slow burn pacing, expert Direction, Cinematography, strong characters along with Goslings laconic moodiness makes this movie a most entertaining experience. Fully recommended.",10,2,14,4 June 2018
Logan," terribly overrated and plodding --why was this made??
","I was not a big fan of dark knight but I will take that movie any day over this garbage. For god's sake this is a superhero movie---and depth is not achieved by showing devolution of wolverine into a straw man!!! This is a muddled-plodding movie where sacrifices are made by superheroes in such an insignificant way that it makes even the previous wolverine movies irrelevant. Hugh Jackman is a charismatic and talented actor and he was born to play the role of wolverine---but sadly here he is a shell of himself and you cannot wait for movie to end......movie never picks up pace, even though this is supposed to be a road movie....an anticlimactic, unsatisfying ending with confused half-hearted political undertones. Watch at your own risk.",1,29,67,8 March 2017
John Wick: Chapter 2," sharp, crisp, atmospheric action movie
",This is a very good and entertaining action movie and Keanu Reeves carries it effortlessly. Most of the scenes are done the old-fashioned way (sans-CGI) and the movie is better for it. Plot is simple but mercifully it is in straight line with no deviation from the main goal---get back to fun with imaginative action set pieces. The plot elements are clearly described in the trailer so I will not waste space here. One could argue (nitpicking) that the movies sometimes lacks a genuine tension and if there is a follow- up it would be good to see some of this without changing the general tone. Regardless this is high quality action movie--even for non-action movie lovers!,8,2,5,8 March 2017
