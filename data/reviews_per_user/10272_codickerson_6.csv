Ford v Ferrari," Hard Acceleration!
",If you like being placed in the seat of a race car while sitting in the middle of a movie theater then this is the movie for you! Totally awesome!,10,1,2,27 November 2019
Interstellar," One viewing may not suffice
","I saw this opening night (Thursday). I wanted the full monty. That means IMAX (I drove across town to get it). Wow! There are only a handful of films that have visually overwhelmed me and required a second go (or more). The first was 2001 A Space Odyssey. Star Wars Empire Strikes Back and Avatar come to mind for now. This was such a spectacle with a very complex script I'll admit I left the theater with a lot of questions. I knew it was a viscerally thrilling experience, I just couldn't fully explain the ending to my inquiring mind. I write this piece having seen this amazing film again four days later (No IMAX). OMG! I loved this movie even more tonight than four days ago. For me at least, it took two viewings for the grandeur of this project to reveal its power and intellectual reach. This is a science fiction film for the ages!",10,38,70,10 November 2014
Big Hero 6," No adults please, this is a kid's movie
","As a single senior with no kids to accompany me to this well received animated wonderment, I was confident that this movie would entertain me in the same vein as The Lego Movie and Wreck It Ralph. I thought it was again built for kids with a sprinkling of adult concepts enough to emerge from childlike entertainment to amuse the adult funny bone throughout. Wrong! This is a kid's movie...period. Intense color, action, no logic to the story elements, just a kind of psychedelic splattering of stream of consciousness video game dream sequences. Over 18? Beware the waste of your movie dollar. Under 18? The action, state of the art animation, and absolute childlike fantasies brought to life, it's beyond lovable.",5,77,205,11 November 2014
Lucy," False premise plus an irrational storyline
","I love Scarlett Johansson. She and Morgan Freeman's voice were the only two elements that made this sci-fi fart of logic, physics, and rational thought watchablebarely. The premise of the film (we use only 10% of our brains) is total wives tale BS. If you know this going in, like I do, it makes this thing even more absurd because of the crap they attribute from 20-100% brain function as an excuse to brazen their special effects weirdo 'mind-blowing' visuals and existential concepts.If that were not enough pukable storytelling in itself, the film wreaks of gratuitous unaccounted for carnage in human life and property to make you, oh yeahpuke! Our heroine's car chase through city streets cause ginormous crashes and carnage realistically involving hundreds of innocent adults and children in car seats and are totally ignored as if no real people inhabit this make believe world. If you're a first person game shooter, then this is not an issue for you. In one scene our heroine actually shoots some innocent nobody on an operating table in an Asian hospital just to make room for herself! The morality of this action is not even a twinkle in the storyteller's eye and is not presented to take away an iota of sympathy from our heroic Amazonian babe. This movie is a real tough slog for those with a logical bone in their bodies!",2,2,12,11 August 2014
Sully," What we never imagined was happening
","I had no idea all of these examinations of the competence, judgments and decisions of Sully were taking place behind the scenes as we regular folk out here were totally accepting of his heroic accomplishment. Wow! Knowing that he had so much more to endure after the fact was absolutely fascinating. Again incredible kudos to Clint Eastwood for another amazing film. The realism and authenticity of virtually every frame was awe inspiring. I felt like I was there for the original experience. I guess we should expect nothing less than that from an Oscar winning director like Eastwood, but to do it time and time again is remarkable.",9,0,2,12 September 2016
The Martian," Gravity and Cast Away plus special effects!
","Simply an amazing combination of human emotion, science fiction story, special effects, and let's not forget pure thrills! One of Matt Damon's best film characters. ps. My viewing was in 3D which I thoroughly recommend. Science fiction aficionados tend to be sticklers for logical foundation before they can enjoy the story's progressions and theme. I'm one of those and have abandoned many a film from my enjoyment list due to poor establishment of logic and/or plausibility. Though not perfect, it contains so much heart, emotion, science, and spectacular presentation, it is a combination devoutly to be wished by any science fiction wannabe.",10,6,67,2 October 2015
