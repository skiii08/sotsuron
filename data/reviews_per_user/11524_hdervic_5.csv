Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," More Like Zero out of Ten Stars.
","****I discuss some of the flaws in Cohen's attempt at representing someone from Kazakhstan**** The only reason I gave this movie 1 star is because zero is not an option. Sacha Baron Cohen is a poor excuse for a comic. His brand of comedy, laughter at the expense of somebody in a contrived situation, failed to make me laugh. Moreover, he has a major chip on his shoulder that he tries to knock off by way of denigrating so many groups. This would-have-been rabbi uses Muslims, Eastern Europeans, Women, Gays, and Americans as fodder. I think Cohen is doing nothing more than using this poor attempt at a mockumentary to convey his xenophobic, racist, and misogynistic views.Additionally, he does not look Kazakh, maybe somebody from the Caucasus region, but definitely not Kazakh. The captions on the screen in the Cyrillic alphabet do not actually say anything; they are a hodge-podge of random letters that quickly disappear under the superimposed supposed English translation. Anytime he says something like 'dzien dobry, dziekuje,' or 'jak se mas' he is speaking Polish, a Western Slavic language. Kazakh is a Turkic language, like most of the other languages spoken in Central Asia. With a little more attention to detail maybe this could have been a funny movie in spite of all the scatological humor. But Cohen must think a separating ocean is enough to keep him from developing an authentic character for the American viewing public.Cohen is a bore and with any luck his fifteen minutes of fame are ready to expire. I hope all of the law-suits filed against him are ruled in favor of the plaintiffs.",1,7,15,2 December 2006
"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"," Disney Cashing in and Then Some.
","Peter Jackson's Masterful Lord of the Rings trilogy opened a flood gate of fantasy ripoffs and wannabes. Disney's Narnia is no exception. When the storyline is not paralleling a biblical narrative it glosses over any attempt at fleshing out any of the characters, who are two-dimensional at best. The only exception is Tilda Swinton's White Witch character. One of the best scenes is the Pagan sacrifice ritual, where I was able to feel something other than the movie's sugarcoating on my teeth. The movie is beautiful to watch. And given a chance, the remaining cast seem capable of creating memorable characters. I like the beavers, too; the female beaver's voice is none other than the enjoyable and funny Dawn French from the Vicar of Dibley and French and Saunders. Otherwise this film's main achievement is to help boost Disney's revenue at the end of a lackluster year for the film industry. I dread to think that there will be six more of these Disney interpretations of C.S. Lewis' Narnia Series.",4,2,4,2 January 2006
The Prestige," Nolan Delivers Another Fine Film.
","Christopher Nolan delivers another fine film with Christian Bale and Micheal Caine in tow, again. Like Batman Begins, the cinematography in The Prestige draws in the viewer whether the shot is a panoramic Rocky Mountain landscape or a squalid London slum. Nolan's sets are intrinsic to the story and make the unfolding drama all the more compelling. So much of the story is dependent upon the scenario in which a scene occurs. This is a period piece for the 21st century. The performances are very good to excellent by the entire cast. Christian Bale satisfies again with his nuanced role as a competitive illusionist. It is nice to see Hugh Jackman going for roles of substance given his strong acting ability. Micheal Caine, legendary, enough said. The women in the film are equally good. I was floored to learn that Ms. Perabo, who plays Bale's wife in the film, is a native of New Jersey. Her period London accent is flawless. Scarlett Johannsen develops nicely in this film and as long as she seeks dimensional characters like this, she can count on a long and rewarding career. Seeing Bowie on film is always a treat. His turn as Nikola Telsa is well suited to his repertoire. The story is well written and superbly directed. Anybody who writes a spoiler to this film is doing those who have not seen the film a disservice. I only hope Nolan can get the recognition he deserves when all the awards are given.",10,2,3,26 November 2006
Downfall," Superb Anti-War Movie!
","Along with Das Boot, Der Untergang (Downfall) is a gripping, realistic film that speaks against war and the megalomania that can fuel a nation into believing it has moral superiority. Together these two films are the pinnacle of anti-war movies.Bruno Ganz is one of my favorite European actors; his nuanced portrayal of Hitler put me in the bunker along with the remainder of this film's stellar cast.I saw this film late at night when I should have been in bed getting rest for the next day, but I could not tear myself away from the screen. The film's brutal honesty and the phenomenal performances by the entire cast held me captive till the very end. I cannot say enough positive things to describe this film; from the production to the acting and not least of all the story and its implications.I admire a people that can bear their sins to the world and admit without reservation the historical crimes they committed. No one race or nation on the face of the planet is free of the guilt that is displayed in this film, but it takes humility and courage to make plain to everyone that what was done to a nation, the world, and to select groups of people is the result of misplaced trust in false leaders. What remains is a national scar or cross to bear, if you will, that will not go away for some time. I think parallels could be drawn to contemporary issues and global concerns. One of the many things this film succeeds at is to remind us of the lessons in history.",10,3,6,25 July 2006
The Queen," Mirren Deserves the Oscar!!!
","An exceptionally well written, directed, and acted film. I am torn about the best picture category, but would not be disappointed if this film won. I would, however, feel that the Academy would be making a tremendous mistake if they did not honor Helen Mirren with a statue, in spite of the other fine actresses in the category. Ms. Mirren put a face on the most recognized yet most isolated monarch in the world. Kudos! I am far from a royalist sympathizer, but I do appreciate the human element this or any story provides. I was equally moved by the symbology employed by way of 'stalking the stag.' Princes Philip, Charles, William, and Harry, while at Balmoral would go out daily to stalk a 14-point stag for a hunting expedition in order to distract the younger princes from the horror of their mother's untimely and brutal death. Queen Elizabeth encounters the stag in one of the films most beautiful and emotional moments. The Queen's Range Rover breaks down as she tries to ford a river. While waiting for help, the stag appears. Standing before the Queen, the noble animal represents the British Monarchy; its ability to survive despite attempts on its life parallels the longevity of the Crown. The stag's tenuous hold on life mirrors the Queen's trouble at maintaining the monarchy due to rising unpopularity. Her attempt to honor the Spencer family's right to private mourning is seen as inaction and a lack of compassion by her subjects who mourn en masse. When the Queen acquiesces to Prime Minister Blair's recommendations to return to London and acknowledge the mourners she learns of the stag's death. Significant is the fact that the stag was not killed by a 'royal' but by a 'common' investment banker from London. An act portending the fate of the monarchy at the hands of the British subjects if the Windsors fail to modernize. It is not so much that the British, as portrayed in the film, were shouting down with the Queen, but were looking to their Sovereign for consolation during their collective mourning. Mirren and the entire cast succeed at putting this small slice of British history into perspective, and for that this film succeeds.",10,2,4,25 January 2007
