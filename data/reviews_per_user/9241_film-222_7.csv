Blade Runner 2049," Nothing but gratuitous visuals, naked women, no story, and nothing new
","Did Ridley Scott really approve this film??The 1982 film was visionary in creation of a futuristic world, how Earth cultures have mixed, how people live in a dystopian city, and every design element had meaning, was rooted in some concept. The original film already treated the question of whether androids have rights as sentient beings, and whether a manufactured being is capable of love. I fail to see what this 2017 film adds, while being incredibly loose and contradictory in the story telling (if you can call it that). Maybe the director should stick to music videos for meaningless gratuitous visuals: random elements for visual effect with no utility or explanation; naked women; character responses that contradict motivations and sentiments implied in earlier scenes; naked women; sets and technological elements that have zero function except to 'look cool'; naked women; long, ponderous scenes and unnecessary fist-fights whose outcome you already knew 2 minutes ago, meaning it's time to cut! I found it tiresome how good-looking and fashionable every single extra was -- in such a nasty, dead world, they sure have plenty of time for make-up, hair, and slick get-ups.I love science fiction and am perfectly willing to suspend disbelief, if the writer or filmmaker creates at least a self-consistent world that is plausible given the key premise. This world is half- baked without much time spent on fleshing out at least a little backstory for each scene design and character. Thin, thin, thin. If you want to explore the idea of androids rebelling, watch the 1990's version of Battlestar Galactica, which has the political economy, military science, and existential questions actually thought through.2 instead of 1 because the HD is very fine on an IMAX screen, but the rest of the movie is a confused, tiresome, meaningless, self-indulgent, woman-objectifying, annoying, male box office marketing scheme. I don't get the rave reviews. Maybe people are comparing this to comic book hero movies, rather than to the ideas of Philip K. Dick and what the first movie accomplished. Well, if the standard is comic book blockbusters, fine (actually, plenty of comic book blockbusters at least have a coherent story and character development), but this movie does not deserve comparison to the original. I'm flummoxed that Ridley Scott allowed this mess to be produced under his name. Shame on him and Denis Villeneuve for making this film. Now that Harvey Weinstein has been exposed, given the objectification of women in this film, I'm wondering if we will soon be seeing more men in the business being outed, such as...",2,15,34,9 October 2017
Black Swan," Neither enlightening nor moving, only titillating. Squandered opportunity with no dancing.
","Well, the rave reviews are primarily a symptom of the cultural illiteracy of film critics and the public today. I guess no one has seen Moira Shearer in 'The Red Shoes.' THERE's a movie with true depth and artistry, a true-to-life dramatic story for the ages, and real dancing to go with it, dancing that expresses the story, and camera-work that is to die for. Sorry, 'Black Swan' is a titillating bit of over-the-top cheap thrills.Nowadays, if we get bashed over the head with a white/black dichotomy, then people are so thrilled that they got it and think they saw something artsy. Please.Nina is supposed to go through a transformation from uptight purity to free, dark, sexuality; however, we never see any transformation in Nina's dancing. Any change in her character was achieved through over-the-top special effects. Natalie Portmann makes certainly a respectable effort with the dancing, but if the director really had an eye, he would not have cast her. Would you have an amateur actor scratch out a violin concerto, or would you dub it in, instead? She really did not need to do much acting because of all the horror effects, so they may as well have cast a ballet dancer who could really dance the two parts. Then they could have shown some full ballet numbers where the contrast is fully expressed, and then there would have been true comprehension by the audience of what goes into achieving the ultimate as an artist . There was pretty much no choreography or real dancing in this film, to show audiences the glory and expressiveness of top-notch ballet. What a shame and lost opportunity.Ballet struggles enough to survive in this age of zero cultural education in secondary schools. This was a chance to expose popular audiences to art that they rarely get to see. People came out of 'Amadeus' having learned for the first time really to listen to classical music. They came out of 'Diva' with the aria of 'Tosca' burned into their brain. They come out of 'The Red Shoes' having savored high art, which they can watch over and over again. They come out of 'Black Swan' with little clue of how exquisite ballet can be. Well, hopefully, a few souls will have been intrigued enough to go check out a real ballet.I rate it 4 for entertainment value as a horror flick, but that's all.",4,14,24,13 February 2011
Yes Man," Highly likable homage to L.A., too!
","This is deft comedic writing that just romps about with fun and ease and is never strained. In case no one else noticed, the screenwriters have casually and cleverly translated the original novel/memoir's London setting to Los Angeles. Really, it's an affectionate homage to L.A. culture: the New Age self-help gurus; the exercise/photo group in Griffith Park; the great view of L.A. from the Griffith Observatory's recently completed balcony platform; the Hollywood Bowl dome and amphitheater; the easy mixture with Asian cultures; the small-time alternative rock band with its small local following; the woman with the celebrity cake business; even Carl's (Jim Carrey's) apartment layout with its bland interior courtyard concrete walkway. Maybe it wasn't intentional and the writers were just fitting in whatever came to mind, being in L.A., but for a recent Angeleno transplant to New York, I couldn't help appreciating the review of the landscape.",9,0,0,30 March 2009
Pan's Labyrinth," Unnecessarily violent with meaningless ending
","Well, the art direction is fantastic, but the story doesn't quite hold together. Unnecessary gruesome violence and a really, really bad guy, and the point is..? Yes, there were such bad people in fascist Spain, but I derive no thoughtful insights from this portrayal. The little girl's fantasy world is an equally frightening escape from the horrors of humanity, and the point is..? I guess I should not be expecting this to be a cut above the usual blockbuster fare in terms of story, but somehow all the film festival hype around it lead me to think it would have some deeper literary qualities. It is entertainment that keeps one's attention with thrills and suspense and moments of beauty, but the black-and-white good vs. bad didn't quite satisfy me. Too bad, the premise of the story had such great potential.",6,2,5,27 June 2007
Rise of the Planet of the Apes," Blockbuster that doesn't overdo it
","I really enjoyed this movie, and I'm a scientist who was well pleased by the writers doing their research to come up with a plausible scientific explanation based on modern biotech ideas! Very clever, concise, even elegant. Was relieved that the story concentrated so much on the relationships between/among the people and the apes/chimpanzees and not all on action. Action served the story, period. Contrary to Roger Ebert's mild complaint that the writers didn't do more with the girlfriend scientist character or with philosophical conundrums for James Franco's character, I am rather relieved to see a movie that has the taste and restraint to describe straightforward characters who are just pleasant, intelligent good people, OMG! There is plenty of poignancy and philosophical significance to the chimpanzee Caesar's coming to self-awareness.Only one weird thing stood out: it's set in San Francisco, but there is nary an Asian visible, not even in crowd scenes. Weird.",Null,1,4,9 August 2011
The Last King of Scotland," Thoughtless young doctor seeks adventure in an exotic country not knowing what he's getting into
","This movie is incredible not only for the performance of Forrest Whittaker but for the all-around outstanding performances, effortless directing and editing, and screenplay that deftly educates the viewer even as the protagonist becomes more aware of the complex and dangerous political situation of a foreign land. This is fictionalized history, so how much dramatic license should be allowed is up to the knowledgeable viewer; nonetheless, the education of the character in the context of Idi Amin's Uganda is well-constructed. The young doctor is a brand-new MD from Scotland who randomly picks Uganda as an exotic destination for his first job, knowing nothing about its culture or history. He thinks he'll go have some fun and adventure in a Third World country, doctoring to the natives, having sex with any attractive woman, black or white, married or not. He considers himself apolitical, free of prejudice against anyone, and perhaps so, but that shallow code of decency derives from insensitivity to others' delicate relationships and thoughtlessness about the consequences of his own acts. His ignorance allows him to be brash and frank with Idi Amin in a chance encounter, which charms the dictator, just as Amin then charms the young doctor. Eventually, the young man's thoughtlessness leads to the unwitting betrayal and death of one earnest government officer, and of women with whom the doctor gets involved, forcing finally some awareness as the atrocities escalate around him. He has been a fool, not realizing that a Third World country is not an exotic playground, but the poverty and strife there is the result of legacies of colonialism and brutal egos seeking power amid a disempowered people.",10,0,2,13 November 2007
Moon," Not really science fiction, but exploration of our practical near-future
","This is a great movie that brings something new, as a thriller, a drama. It is not merely science fiction. I have to compliment the filmmakers on excellent writing, a gripping, suspenseful mystery that leads us on clever plot twists, and wonderful acting.For those who may not keep up with current space developments, this film is an incredibly timely, thoughtful scrutiny of what it would mean to make money off of probably the only potentially commercial resource in space, the Helium-3 on the Moon. There are real, practical questions that people are working on NOW to make this a reality. Fusion energy from He-3 is still only a theoretical idea, but it is definitely there in theory and under development. Other issues not resolved: Can we set up space colonies for people to live in, or is this a pipe dream, the reality being that it is way too expensive to support human life on a non-habitable planetoid (where are your tax dollars going for NASA's manned missions?). Can people really survive mentally in such isolation away from our home planet? Is human labor still better to have than robotic labor in space? What would be the international commercial protocols for exploitation of resources on the Moon -- can one company be granted such a monopoly, and does this inevitably lead again to corporate exploitation of labor or subjugation of people through manipulated political consent and deceit, as happened with oil? With regard to other life support issues in this film, there might be some quibbles, but I won't bother, otherwise I'd have to write some spoiler and give away the mystery, and I think the suspension of disbelief is okay in this case, anyway.This is not really science fiction at all: it is a fictional exploration of current research questions, ethics issues, business ideas, and political debate! What a relief from all that tiresome guns-and-battles science fantasy.A film with solid content on real issues, in a well-structured, entertaining story with a sympathetic character, and excellent acting. This film deserves much wider release. (Dang it, why didn't I think of this story? Great idea!)",10,3,6,1 July 2009
