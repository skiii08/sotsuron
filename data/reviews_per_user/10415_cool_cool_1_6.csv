United 93," Excellent film-making of a real life tragedy.
","United 93 (2006) was a very good documentation of the tragic morning of September 11th 2001 where terrorist's struck America in a big way! The terrorist's hijacked 4 planes that morning, 3 had already hit their intended targets - the World Trade Center, 1st the North Tower, then the South, the 3rd plane hit the pentagon, this film is a tribute to the very brave passengers and the families of Flight 93 - the 4th hijacked plane.As the passengers realised the real life terror that was happening before them, they were so brave and decided to fight the terrorists and in the process prevented the plane from hitting it's intended target - the white house, the plane crashed in a field killing all on board.The film is very well made, powerful and emotional with excellent performances by all the actors, i'm glad they didn't use big name Hollywood types!!, i also agree that it's done professionally and it's done with respect to the people and families that were involved.So in closing, i highly recommend this movie so that people can get a full insight to the courage and bravery of the innocent people of flight 93, we will never forget the images we saw on our TV screens on that fateful morning.",7,0,2,18 June 2006
Hostel," A horror film post 1990 thats actually GOOD!!!!
","Hostel (2005) is a breathe of fresh air for the horror film genre, all we tend to get nowadays is remake after remake, or just general C-grade rubbish with Z-grade actors, so this film surprised and entertained me thats for sure! 80% of horror films that come out these days just don't entertain or thrill me and i lose interest with them before even making it to the end, but this was a great film from an upcoming horror director in Eli Roth.The story is about 3 young men, 2 Americans and 1 European, who are on their travels around Europe searching for the sexiest and horniest women for lots of fun and hot sex!!!! They get told about this Hostel in Slovakia where the girls are gorgeous and dirty, so obviously they make their way out there to see what it's all about, and sure enough at the hostel there are loads of gorgeous young women with great bodies who are up for fun!!!! Everything seems to be going well until strange things start happening, the Americans European friend suddenly goes missing without a trace............. and it appears that the local's aren't as nice and friendly as they initially seem!!! As the 2 American guys try to work out whats going on, they later discover a run down old building where there is a sick business going on, and torture and killing is on the menu.Can the Americans survive this Slovakian evil or will they just become another victim!!! I thought Hostel was a very entertaining horror film, the actors all did a good job, the girls were lovely and there was lots of nudity which is always a good thing, and of course the gore....... yep there was quite abit of blood and gore too.Along with The Hills have eyes remake, i thought this was the best horror film in recent years and i highly recommend it. 8/10",7,5,8,19 August 2006
The Hills Have Eyes," Very good remake, lots of blood and gore!!!
","The hills have eyes (2006) was an enjoyable experience, a better than expected remake of a horror classic, i wasn't a massive fan of the original and found this remake to be much better.The film is about a family who are travelling to California but on their way they get sent down this deserted lane in the desert to save on travelling time, but little do this family know that their detour will turn into a trip to hell.A bunch of freaks who love to torture and kill 'normal' civilians are watching the family from the desert hills and it's not long before the family are fighting for their lives against the evil freaks!!! I'm a big fan of horror films and this movie held my interest, it's creepy at times and there's some strong gore and very disturbing moments, there's lots of blood too, so if your a fan of horror movies then you'll be entertained by this film.In the day and age where us horror fans are over-fed crap remakes such as 'The Fog' 'The Omen' and 'Black Christmas' etc etc or just general crap teen-slasher horrors!!! This was a welcome relief, go and check it out horror fans, you should love it! I'll give this movie 7.5 out of 10.",7,0,0,13 March 2006
The 40-Year-Old Virgin," Highly overrated comedy, unrealistic too!!!
","The 40 year old virgin (2005) is so overrated, most of these voters obviously haven't seen true comedy classics: 'Planes, trains and automobiles', 'Loverboy', 'Blazing Saddles', 'Dumb and Dumber', 'American Pie'...... i could go on and on!!!!!Andy is the 40 yr old virgin played by Carell, who finally gets lucky when Trish, a woman from the ebay store, comes into his shop. He sells her this video/DVD combo with no flair or charisma whatsoever, then she hangs around making small talk until she gives him her number, YEAH RIGHT, as if that would happen in real life!!!There's also a scene where Andy goes into this book shop and acts like a total weirdo trying to impress this sexy young blonde, who ALSO finds him funny and fancies him, UTTERLY FAKE YET AGAIN!!!Lets make things clear here, in REAL LIFE, women aren't impressed by weird, unenthusiastic old men (I'm 27 by the way and have a nice girlfriend, so i'm not bitter), but how this Andy character manages to get women after him all the time is LAUGHABLE!!!You can count the funny scenes in this movie on one hand, stick with American Pie, at least it's a lot more realistic and LOADS more funny!!4/10 for this overrated mainstream junk!!!",3,5,17,9 January 2006
28 Days Later...," Terrible British attempt at a genuine zombie/horror movie.
","28 Days Later (2002) is another poor UK horror film, these UK horror films are total rubbish, the only good one i can remember was Dog Soldiers, and that was because it was fun, with great characters, some good gore and a great script!!! Basically what happens in this film is that inside a monkey testing lab, something goes wrong and a deadly virus called 'rage' turns everyone into ravenous zombies, there's only a small group of survivors left to fight against them! Original huh!!! The only thing i like about this film was the visions of the main character walking around a totally deserted London, but apart from that this film soon becomes very boring, i didn't care for any of the characters and the script was dull too.Advice to U.K filmmakers, 'DONT MAKE ANY MORE HORROR FILMS', Americans know how to make great horror movies and we don't, it's as simple as that!! I give this film 2/10 for having a go at least!!!",2,2,6,30 June 2006
Carrie," All time classic horror movie.
","Carrie (1976) is one of the classic horror films of our time, written by Stephen King and brought to film by Brian De Palma.The story is about a plain young girl called Carrie who's old fashioned and cant fit in no matter how hard she tries, she has no friends and constantly gets bullied and harassed by all the other girls at her school.But what nobody knows is that Carrie is a very special girl with powers that can cause devastating force!!! When Carrie gets unexpectedly invited to the prom by the school hunk, she thinks her life is turning around. But at the prom, there is a nasty surprise waiting for Carrie, a nasty cruel prank that has been set up to hurt and devastate Carrie. But all the laughter aimed at Carrie soon turns to screams as she unleashes her powers in retribution!!! Carrie is a great horror movie, with a great script and Sissy Spacek was perfect for the role of Carrie, this was her finest hour on the silver screen, no doubt about it. William Katt and Nancy Allen are also strong in the supporting roles as the school hunk and most popular girl (bitch).Carrie also scores highly for it's excellent ending, one of the best in horror movie history!! Surely if you're a horror film fan you've seen Carrie? if you haven't then WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN for the past 30 years??????? 10/10.",10,6,10,8 January 2007
