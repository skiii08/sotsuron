Black Swan," Did We See The Same Film
","I heard a few reviews that gave this film rave accolades but had I dug a little deeper I would have found the true nature of opinion as to this thud. Mary Poppins meets Psycho, would be a great title for this nearly disappointing rehash of so many other films of yesteryear. I did see some quality acting among so much predictable scene after scene from beginning to end. The only question that kept gnawing at me was, what was real and what was hallucination. If that was the primary purpose of this film (confusion) then there in lies the only feeble accomplishment of this movie. One big plus though was the music that Swan Lake has endured through the ages.",2,13,31,5 January 2011
Two for the Money," One For The $$$, Two For The No Show!!!
","Every once in a while a movie comes along that you feel should have never been made or at least, if they're going to make it, come up with a better story than this. Anyone whose ever gambled knows that there are no, etched in stone, sure things when it comes to betting on football. This movie is a total farce. Why? Because it fails to be honest about the real world of gamblers. I sure had high hopes for this flick considering the mega cast. To to bad all that talent directed toward a dismal story.Frankly, I just didn't care if they won or lost in the end. Better writing and or something to really draw us in would have maybe made this somewhat worthy but alas, not today. Mathew, in the beginning, got me going with some decent character development then it just went flat.",2,9,19,11 October 2005
Interstellar," Not The Film I Expected By A Long Shot
","The problem is... Stellar is so complex and confusing you are at the mercy of tying together so many scientific issues you get bogged down in the constant slow dialog and the dragging delivery of the twists and turns of what has got to be the most complex multi-plotted movie I've seen in years. I sensed 'overkill' of some scenes that seemed constantly drawn out that if I had a remote I would have fast forwarded through many parts. I am a big Sci-Fi movie lover and as such I will bring huge praise to the writers and producers of well made movies of this kind. Before going to see this much anticipated film that was given spectacular and high praise from several cites such as IMDb, I was dumbfounded by what appeared to be a movie almost impossible to find fault with in those reviews. Whats more this film was much too long (2 hrs 55 minutes) including previews of trailers. No human bladder should be put to such an ungodly test. Lastly I want to again point out that many reviews are suspect in this world of questionable truths of opinion.",6,15,29,8 November 2014
The Grand Budapest Hotel," A Rare Gem of a Film
",Every once in a while a few special people in the movie industry make a film that is unique in several ways that it is a stand out one of a kind film. 'Grand Budapest Hotel' is such a film. It takes the viewer on a one of a kind adventure. Great casting makes it even better. So many characters developing a mixed bag of surprises. This film delivers a most unusual story but with a wit and humor not seen in recent years. This movie should be on the minds of Academy Awards pickers next spring for sure.R. Finnes turns in a robust performance through out the entire movie with his portrayal of a slime ball but creative head proprietor of this hotel. Go see it and enjoy a special film of a rare type that seems to be increasing in popularity with movie goers. It could be the sleeper of this year.,8,0,5,7 May 2014
Drive," Almost but Not Quite
","A really outstanding film that relies on less is more. This is a great film and could have been even better had they taken the time to finish it and come up with an ending. What we have is so many interesting characters that keep you guessing. There's some interesting segments that build up to excellent confrontations. Many actors developed their individual characters quite well. My reservations come from the lack of a successful ending. (SPOILERS) The ending left me convinced that I could have made a much better ending than the movie left the viewer to watch. As it ended I even realized that the makeup mask wasn't even incorporated for it's best use. A better ending would have been ...the Driver, upon meeting Albert in the parking lot while wearing a metal sleeve shakes his hand as Brooke's attempts to gash his arm but...SURPRISE!!! The Driver kills Brookes with his own knife during the struggle. While we're at it, the kill off of Nino was anti-climatic.Still, this is a very well made film with quality contributions from directing to camera layout and powerful acting.",7,1,4,19 September 2011
The Amazing Spider-Man 2," A major production full of 'FX & CGI' Lacking Real substance.
","This could have been a very intriguing film but all the special effects have become so common place that the average movie goer has become numb to the big screen blasts of fx's and the rest. This was a very long movie that had several scenes of mundane dialog having little do with entertaining the viewer. Was this film bad? No, but there were all too many times that I wondered if the story board people realized just how boring the scenes had become.The characters and plot just fell so short of taking the viewer on an adventure worthy of the comic book. If there should be a 3rd in this series please get the writers of the comic books to put forth a really exciting story. Lastly let the special effects be the secondary hook and let the story be worthy.",4,13,29,3 May 2014
Paranormal Activity," One Big Dud!!
","I've seen scary and I've seen duds. This was one big dud and that's being kind. There were a dozen things that could have help make this a really scary film. Not having any sound track left a big void. Trying to be a Blair Witch wore very thin and became obviously a copycat film. It seemed everyone in the theater that we attended left wanting more and feeling short changed dollar for dollar. Simply put..A big let down after hearing positive reviews from someone who obviously saw a different flick. When I think scary I think The Omen and The Exercist. They delivered by chilling us to the bone. Evil that had rhyme and reason. Evil that scared the bejezzes out of the viewer. Disappointing too for lacking build up, character development and what ever the evil force came from or why or even some shred of history. I almost wanted my $$$ back for this rip off.",2,17,33,2 November 2009
Elysium," Been There -Done That
","Remake, redone it, and same 'ol same 'ol. Get my drift? Lots of Hollywood feeding us what they think we will by but, it just ain't so. Visually a stunning FX movie. Lots of C.G. and 'Big Bucks' effects. This story has been done so many times before. Corruption of power and the old 'Haves & Havenots' are the themes seen here. Matt does a stellar job delivering his character throughout this so-so film but as for Jodie I'm gonna tell it like it is. Jodie 'over-acts' the character and makes me wonder how casting decided on her to be a villain. When will Hollywood come to the realization that copycat films become just another remake film? I was impressed with the filming and camera work.",4,12,23,9 August 2013
National Treasure," One hard to believe flik but fun to watch!
","Lets just keep it simple. This is just what the doctor ordered. Here in lies a simple formula of light comedy and a whole lotta adventure. I thought this movie had entertainment in mind.(not to mention all the sight-seeing locations WE'VE ALL COME TO APPRECIATE! Cage was pretty good in the lead role and the supporting cast did themselves proud I thought. A problem came into play with the complexity of the clues that only a genius could decipher. If there was one particular problem that was overly obvious, it was the convenient timing of the bad guys showing up at just the right time throughout the movie. On a scale of 1-10 ....8",Null,1,1,28 November 2004
"McFarland, USA"," A Movie to Send a Message
",A Capra like film to stir the heart. To be touched by the little guy stuck in the grips of poverty. Still it delivers on man's emotions that touch you deeply if you believe in the goodness of nature. Kevin portrays a teacher on his last legs trying to find his place in teaching field. While this film attempts to tell a 'TRUE' story the film doesn't quite deliver that story without issues. All in all it does send a message to believe in practice & hard work paying off. Was something missing? Yes!! All in all an entertaining movie with a solid message but the truth is in the fact that it's a true story as is given it's just due.In order to capture the feeling of 'real' storyline the film stumbles along the way trying to nearly get the message of the issues of prejudice and poverty. It is a very ..Feel Good Movie to give the viewer a sense of hope thru hard work.,7,6,24,20 February 2015
12 Years a Slave," Twelve Years Stolen
","A bit slow to start and yet a movie with a delivery unlike any other. The story seems to be simple and yet it pulls at your conscience. The outstanding performance of almost all the cast makes this a truly deep and realistic portrayal of the injustices that were an everyday way of life in the slavery states during the PreCivil War era. I found the dialog all too often difficult to comprehend. Thus, I was lost and frustrated by the script that tried too hard to give the viewer a much too lengthy and confusing scene with language that made little sense to the average viewer. I still found this film full of earthy realism and a true sense of hopelessness for the black man in an era full of racism.",8,1,3,14 November 2013
The Wolf of Wall Street," Less Is More
","A gigantic film with a lot of great performances to an excess. Blatant nudity and overkill foul language. Look folks, I'm no prude but when a film is drowning in 'F' bombs and ranting of expletive swearing I get tired of it simply put. Even Clark Gable would yell.. 'Enough!!' Please give the movie goer the benefit of an intermission or at least warn us that the film is going to stretch my bladder to it's extreme limits or ban extra large pop drinks. At over three hours long (don't forget the 8-10 minutes of ads & trailers) there was a constant line of viewers going and coming including yours truly during this marathon film. One more detail to share. Less is more means that this could have been a great film if the editing left about 30 plus minutes on the floor. Several scenes were over done and dragged the viewer along for the redundant ride.",6,3,6,17 January 2014
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Nice Try But No Brass Ring
","After the heated opening and things settle down from all the hoop-la even sane Star Wars addicts will admit that the acting & dialog were painful to endure. Too bad, 'cause the visual fireworks were great. Lucas? If your listening....Go back and watch your own original #4. There the characters were fun and their interaction was great. We bonded with each and every one. Carrie Fisher, Harrison Ford, Mark Hammel, and most of all Sir Alec Guiness made the magic happen. I guess it's the IL' story of seeing the forest for the trees. All in all it still was a wild ride with all the FX and computer wizardry. Gee if only we saw what could have been.",4,0,1,22 May 2005
Taken 2," Satisfying to a Nearly Great Film
","When you enter the theater hoping that the film will not disappoint you put great expectations on the film. I knew that many reviews varied in rating Taken II. Thus, I was perplexed by the wide range of opinions there in. This sequel and supposedly last film in the theme had to live up to the rave reviews of the first and the first run of reviews definitely were varied. After seeing the movie I was more than satisfied by the quality of all aspects of the film. The acting and script were top notch. The characters were realistic and the plot was mostly believable. The talents of Liam came through as was expected. The believability flowed well up to the last 7 or 8 minutes when the final scene turned sour when Liam gave the ringleader an ultimatum that was just too unreasonable after all he'd been through. Thus, a great film with a thud ending.",8,1,2,10 October 2012
The Dark Knight Rises," This Knight Tries Too Hard
","So many viewers that find the 3rd Batman such a masterpiece that I'm wondering ...Did we all see the same film? As a great writer once said..'Less is More!' That must mean that more is less (filling). When a movie crowds 3 hours you better have a strong flow of story, plot, and characters. As I watched the movie I struggled with understanding Bane's dialog which I heard many others admit to the same problem.This left me confused as to the villain's mission. Copycating the Hannibal Lector face mask was not successful this time.To have multiple subplots seems to bog down the film while many characters come and go adding little if anything of significance. I felt this 3rd and final film forgot what made the first and second films the successes they were. Batman and his development of gadgets and weaponry to thwart the bad guys. To each his own as to the level of success of this film but, as I saw it, this was way too much crammed into this finally.",4,8,20,20 July 2012
Unbroken," A docudrama that works for 30 minutes
","I had high hopes for this film but it fell into an abyss that turned hopelessly a drag. Unlike the greater film 'Fury' this film wanders along slower, and slower to the far too distant end. Angela attempted a major task in the making of this film and it simply was lacking in it's meat of story. It simply became a movie shallow in substance. Even the audience became watch lookers and ...When is this going to end? As to what worked, I again praise the opening scenes and storyline thinking it was enlightening as to the dog fights between Jap Zeros and the U.S Bomber Squadrons. It was the highlight of the film. Realizing just how intense the air battles were. Angela..you have done well but on this film you fell short. Here's hoping you learn from this train wreck.",4,7,14,6 January 2015
The Purge," A Sad Attempt At Thriller Drama
","Don't you wonder who had the audacity to put up the money to fund this piece of horse fodder? I new going in that it was rated low by several reasonably intelligent reviewers, but still a boring afternoon led me and spouse to the afternoon viewing of this stinker.How bad was it? Well, it was hard not to call it a one star dumper. The story is so out of this world, contrived that you have to consider it a joke of a scenario. The characters are so unbelievable that many audience members would laugh at many of weirdest concocted scenes. I, for one, just could not help the laffability of the stupidly weird members of the cast. Lastly, I would simply avoid this comical farce. Let's hope Hollywood execs start to find meaningful scripts that deserve a shot.",2,1,3,9 June 2013
300," 300 Spartans Magic of Grafics Has Success!
","The superlatives are almost endless and much can be said for the dynamics of the visual effects. This is a most enjoyable film. Cast and script are superb not to mention the fact that this was filmed in an aircraft hanger with 'blue screen.' I think that sound , music and visuals to be best appreciated, one must go to 'I-MAX' and get the most of it. Only one complaint...The movie devotes much to much attention to the battle scenes and left out significant historical info that could have made our appreciation of it all the more elevated. Definitely one of this year's best. Along with the timing of this film several documentaries have been released that give the viewer the added facts that make this viewer wanting of the film-maker to tie together more of the history that would have made the '300' a much more appreciated docudrama. All in all I still have nothing but praise for it. Go see it!",8,0,3,10 March 2007
Fantastic Four," Four Out Of Five Points Work Well!
","My wife and I always seem to disagree about ...'should you read reviews B/4 going to see a movie'. She doesn't while I tend to read them and regardless if they slam the flick or not I 'usually' go ahead and sit down at the theater. I Eat my popcorn and decide for myself its' merits. I do pay more attention to some reviewers than others. We all have our favorites. Now then, about the 'Fantastic Four'...I came away with mostly a satisfaction overall. Good casting like Alba made feasting for the eyes. Story line seemed short of depth and some of the characters lacked development. FX's were top flight. This is one comic book movie that met the test of fulfilling the essence of the comic book. My wife liked it somewhat more than me. She never read the comics though which I do believe makes a big difference in one's perspective. Costumes were interesting especially 'The Thing'. Very realistic looking right down to the facial details. I can't remember did he only have three fingers and a thumb in the comics? What didn't work was 'Elasticman'. I think someone else could have done it better.",7,2,4,12 July 2005
The Great Gatsby," Wrapped In Decorative Ribbons but Missing
","This was an amazing film for fx but as for substance there was considerable time to be disappointed. I had high hopes for this classic film, wanting to see how modern day film-makers would bedazzle us with the latest effects and talents. Leo was his usual talented self while some of the other actors seemed miss-cast in their roles. No doubt there will be awards this winter for many catagorys pertaining to this film. After the film ended many patrons felt that after a pause for thought, several agreed that there was an average rating for this eye candy flick. I ask myself quite often...Does the film achieve success when you consider all the heavy money that went into making it? This was borderline but just under the wire in my mind.",5,6,12,11 May 2013
