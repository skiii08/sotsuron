The Hangover," Hangover-rated! There is a better alternative!!
","Okay, look. I'll admit that it is a little funny, and I am okay with the stupid, sophomoric humor, after all, that is what makes a lot of movies great. But COME ON, PEOPLE! A 7.9 rating? 270 million in box office sales?!!! Let's get real here. Not only is this a blatant rip-off of so many movies, but its the same tired old stupid humor. More importantly there is a very similar, yet very witty, brilliant movie out there that has been criminally neglected, while this mediocre, dime-a-dozen film achieves so much acclaim!! People, do not waste your hard earned money on a movie that the masses say you should like. Instead check out the movie, Very Bad Things! In case you don't remember it, this little gem came out back in '98. It is about a group of guys taking their soon to be married buddy to Vegas for a bachelor party (much like the Hangover). They have an outrageous party with booze and drugs and... a hooker. The hooker ends up dead and the group decides to cover the whole thing up so they can get their buddy back home to be married and to continue their lives as normal. Of course things are not that simple, and the cover-up leads to more death, and the web of lies getting spun even tighter. Christian Slater leads a awesome cast of familiar faces, including Cameron Diaz, in this hugely under rated black-comedy by director Peter Berg! If you loved Heathers you'll, at the very least, like this movie. I promise most of you will like it better than the Hangover! Give it a try. Let me know what you think! This might not be the best comedy ever, but the offbeat humor, along with good story telling, genuinely funny characters, and witty dialog, put the Hangover to shame.",3,1,2,20 December 2010
The Expendables," Sly Hasn't Lost His Touch!
","With Stallone's drawing power in question, it has left many wondering how The Expendables will pan out. His recent revivals of both Rocky and Rambo were very well received by the general public, however, no evidence in the box-office suggests this. The latest Rocky and Rambo grossed an estimated $70M and $40M respectively. Even unadjusted for inflation, these films still failed to gross more than their originals from 25 and 30 years prior. Well, enough history. Let us talk Expendables.From start to finish, this film is an absolute feel good movie. The action is absolutely fantastic, for there are plenty of fast moving, hard hitting fight scenes. Some more than others, but in typical Stallone fashion, the action will get your adrenaline pumping. Not since the last Rocky film, and more so, the older Rocky films, have I experienced that feeling of invincibility and manliness that only a Stallone flick can give you.What makes this movie even more enjoyable is the ensemble cast. Not only is it an assembly of great action names, but as characters, they are very likable, and seem to each have a quality about them that is not overdone, but done just right. Watching this bad ass group of mercenaries on screen kinda gives the viewer a feeling of looking in at a family, or experiencing a kinship between one another. It comes across to me that Sly and co. have done just as much to show us the caring and closeness of these tough guys as opposed to a bunch of empty characters functioning only to advance plot as I seen in Rambo.For everything that Sly did wrong with Rambo, he got right with the Expendables. Rambo is great for the violence; The Expendables is great for everything. I strongly suggest that you see this film. I promise, unlike most movies today that make you feel like crap afterwords, this movie will leave you with a smile on your face. It is not the seriousness of 2012 nor does it have to do with other worldly concerns. It is a fun movie that does what it is intended to do: Kick Ass!",10,5,14,15 August 2010
Watchmen," The Watchmen: For fans only!
","Zach Snyder's latest visionary epic is very impressive, yet ridiculous. It has a lot of elements about it that I loved, and I thought were very memorable and entertaining; There were just things about the movie through its seriousness that were either laughable, questionable, or just stupid.First, on the positive side, this film is not without its redeemable qualities. For instance, the performances wielded by the cast were very admirable. Especially Jackie Earle Haley's portrayal of Rorschach. On a side note: It's nice to see such a familiar face reemerge from the seventies golden-age of cinema, and begin making appearances in mainstream film once again. Haley, if you remember was in the Bad News Bears films and Breaking Away. He was a teen idol from the seventies. Another great aspect was the graphic violence of the film. Scenes of devastation, mutilation, and impressive choreography were very intense and pleasing to the entertainment value. And the story, though complicated and, at times, hard to pick up on, carried with it several surprises.As far as what weakens the film, I found it to be extremely comical in parts, and also questionable as to certain elements. For one thing, seeing people as costumed heroes interacting in a human drama made it hard for me to take it seriously. That of course is just my opinion and very much debatable from person to person. But that Jon character walking around in a speedo for half the film and with his dingaling hanging out for the other half, I just couldn't take it seriously. Not just his appearance, but the other costumed vigilantes as well. There costumes were almost goofy. Then there is the questionable aspects. If they can be killed by a mere bullet, what was to stop them from being killed already. They call them superheroes, but they weren't too super to me.I say for fans only, because I think most casual viewers would not appreciate it for what it is. I think unless you are a fan of comic books, you might have a hard time getting past the same things I did. But that is also what I admired about the film. You can literally tell that this is a movie for the comic book fans. It did not compromise itself or its own integrity to suit the masses, so for that, I commend Zach Snyder for the direction, and for the Warner and Paramount hierarchy for staying out of the way.",5,2,3,12 December 2009
