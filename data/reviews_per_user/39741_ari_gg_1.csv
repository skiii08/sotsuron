Despicable Me 2," EXCELLENT movie..... BUT something was very concerning
","This movie was excellent but....Let me start off by saying: I am not the type of person to be easily offended by anything but there was a part of the film that made my friend and I very comfortable. It seemed very awkward and the whole theater was thrown off by it. Violence against women is not funny and should not be in a movie rated for young viewers. I'm not upset about this at all but it made the rest of the movie a little awkward.. almost as if making you wonder if someone was angry at an ex-girlfriend and decided to make this scene to spite her.I won't give anything away but the scene I am talking about involves a young women dressed in leopard print with a lot of makeup on. Her character is superficial and annoying. Long story short, she ends up being drugged while out on a date and then her limp body is tossed around and violated in a violent way (an awkward few minutes that seemed like an eternity)until she ends up face down tossed onto her front steps at the end of the night. I found it inappropriate to expose young children to that sort of behavior. I could understand if it was some sort of magic weapon used against her or something completely made up.. but drugging a woman and then violating her limp body is not something I would want to expose my children to.Just a thought. Other than that the movie way awesome. Definitely would not take my children to see it.",8,1,2,12 July 2013
