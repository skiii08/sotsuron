","I saw this movie about two weeks after it came out and being a Sandler fan I was naturally excited, but when I left the theater I was stunned. For the first time I had not laughed once during an Adam Sandler movie. If you ask me he should not be making movies that involve any romance at all. He should just do what he is good at mindless, pointless COMEDY. I mean look at the movies that made him famous Happy Gilmore, Waterboy, Anger Mangement, Little Nickey, what did they all have in common, thats right comedy which didn't involve any romance at all. What surprises me even more is that people said Teacher's Pet was bad, well this movie takes the cake. And Adam if you are reading this I have the perfect title for your next movie.
