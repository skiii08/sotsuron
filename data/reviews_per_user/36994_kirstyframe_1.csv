Hereditary," So much potential
","Which seems to be the case for a lot movies now a days. I went into this movie thinking maybe the mum will turn out insane and lapse of memory, like how she reveals she used to sleep walk. Or how she reveals her whole family has insanity, suicide, etc. to me that is scary- sleeping in ur bed and u wake up with ur mom stanind over u with bad intentions. But nope, had to go with the whole paranormal activity my family is in a secret cult and wants to possess u. The atmosphere was really good at the beginning- the first main scare of the scene where the mom sees her recently deceased mother....scary. The little girl- hate to say it but she was creepy all on her own. The weird clicking sound though? Just went downhill shortly after her death. Laughable at the end.",5,5,10,11 June 2018
