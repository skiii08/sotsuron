It," Disappointed
",Don't waste your time. The movie drags on with no real plot. It's a long 2 hours 15 minutes. No different than the first It movie. Not even worth the rental. Don't get the really great movie reviews but to each their own opinion. The ending like the entire was nothing out of the predictable boring conclusion. They beat up the monster clown killing it. Then romance brews with two of the children. Good movie to fall asleep on though.,1,0,0,16 January 2018
Joker," Movie with substance
","Classes between rich and poor will collide. The poor will take from the rich. This movie is reality of such. Well done, acting super, cinematography super, score super. Violence in comparison to other violent movies was not at a maximum yet graphic yes. If you can't handle it watch The Lion King.",10,3,5,8 January 2020
It Chapter Two," Worth a watch
",Excellent special effects with the monster It. Some humor which fit well. Cool cameo with Stephen King. Usual plot and nice philosophical lecture at ending. A bit long but a decent flick in the horror genre. Could have been kept with a 2 hour or less length.,8,68,122,10 September 2019
