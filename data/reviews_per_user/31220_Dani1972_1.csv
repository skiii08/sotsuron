","The movie is great. Will Smith transforms into something completely different of himself. From expressions to mannerisms, to even totally different rhytm of speech. It shows Smith has potential to be more than just Will Smith - the comedian/rapper. Michael Mann directs with exquiste style. As with Manhunter and Last of the Mohicans, Mann's use of mucic is simply superior to just about anyone else in Hollywood. Raising a song by Salif Keita, an African (from Mali to be specific) singer virtually unknown in anglo-society, to be the final theme of the movie is not only brave, but shows vision, for in the end, what else could it have been? 'Tomorrow' has KO on 'Eye of the Tiger' etc. Raging Bull is technically the better movie from cinematographical standpoint, but on some aspects (aural for example) Ali has even that masterpiece beat. At least the one great boxing movie has finally got some company.What I really don't get are some of you people commenting that movie of two and half hours is too long. What's wrong with you people? Do you really have better things to do than watch the movie? (if so, why are you watching it in the first place?) Why should a good movie end in 90 or whatever minutes?",9,0,0,2 March 2003
