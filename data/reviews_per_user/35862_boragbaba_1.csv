Blade Runner 2049," Censorship ruined this great movie
","I just give one star because of the censorship which has applied to this movie in my country, I had high hopes and excitement for this masterpiece but thanks to Sony Pictures, they sent the movie to our theaters with censorship, and this is unacceptable. And their statement about the censorship was to 'respect to the local cultures', and this is much worse than what they actually did. Still cannot believe for this happened, thanks again Sony Pictures.",1,18,41,9 October 2017
