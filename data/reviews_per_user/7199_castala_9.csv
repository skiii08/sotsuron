The Avengers," Fine, but
","I've seen it in 3D and I'm afraid to say it's adding nothing to this film. In fact, like it happened in so many other films boosted for 3D, the lighting is too dark. For the rest, the movie is as funny as the first Iron Man movie. It's made with serious, but tongue-in-cheek humour. The cast in incredibly laughable. All the main characters are played by great actors, which is helping to support all the non-sense parts of the script. The craziest one is certainly Mark Ruffalo who's playing David Banner, a.k.a The Incredible Hulk. The man is always angry, and it takes a long time before we could see the deepness of his anger. But the waiting is good. The first part of the movie is just too slow, it takes too much time to start. As if the authors were trying too hard to explain every links with all the other Marvel movies made before. It's not always useful. It's nice to see some more great actors like Jeremy Renner, Mark Ruffalo and Scarlett Johanson to join this team.",8,4,12,31 May 2012
The Big Lebowski," Designed to start a cult
","First time I've watched it, I think I've fallen asleep. I've seen it several times, but in parts. Which is also rather funny, considering there is no story in this film, only a confused plot. And there are so much great scenes in this. It's hard to count them all. I just saw it altogether, and it's a must. Many of the actors have been seen in previous Coen brothers films (Goodman, Buscemi, Turturro, Polito, Stormare). They must have did something with their food, because they are stunning in this one. Especially Goodman, except for the fact that he's a using a four-letter word a lot. It's funny, vulgar, well made and played. You can't ask for more.",9,2,5,22 May 2012
Argo," Arranged, but it's fine
","In French, we have this proverb saying: 'This was arranged by the filmmaker'. At the end of 'Argo', we can guess that the conclusion of this story was arranged a little bit for more dramatization, but it's alright. I was a student during these events and I recall it quite well. The help of the Canadian ambassador Ken Taylor was essential for these people. I also remember the harsh comments made by Ronald Reagan, right after all the other hostages came back safely in United States. Everybody knows that the previous president Jimmy Carter did all he can to bring back these people. It's real fine from Ben Affleck to let Carter speaks during the credits. It's a well deserved way to thank him. Alan Arkin is absolutely great in here, and he certainly deserves another Academy Award for his performance.",9,4,7,14 November 2012
Gone Baby Gone," Great script from a brilliant novel
","Dennis Lehane's book, with these Kenzie-Gennaro detective couple, is enjoyable. 'Gone baby gone' is certainly one of the nicest thriller novel ever written. The script by Affleck and Stockard is also great. They rightfully chose to cut the angles and went to the core of this story. They did well. For his first movie as a director, Ben Affleck is doing a very good effort, especially with his cast. There are a bunch of great actors in this, Morgan Freeman, Ed Harris, Amy Ryan and Amy Madigan, and they are all good. The only thing that bothers me is Casey Affleck. He's done a good performance, but the only problem is he doesn't look like the part is described in Lehane's novel. So it's hard to believe is as tough than he has to. But the couple is completing with Michelle Monaghan is OK. They fit well together and you have to believe in them to like this movie. It's a brutal movie, with a lot of violence and coarse language. But hey, the story is going on in the poorest and tough neighbourhood in Boston. You have to be good in vocal English, because the slang used is sometimes hard to hear.",8,0,1,11 December 2011
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," Good, but not enough
","I've read all the books in 2011, while watching the Swedish movies on television, translated in French. I've enjoyed both of them a lot, even if I have to admit, like a lot of people, that the 2nd and 3rd movie were not as good as the first one. This David Fincher's movie might be seen if you know nothing of Stieg Larsson books and movie adaptations. If you do, it's better not watching it. I'm afraid to say this version is adding nothing to help us understanding Larsson's world. One of the saddest thing in Fincher's movie is the different accents used by the actors. While Rooney Mara is using a guttural and rough accent as Lisbeth Salander, Daniel Craig and Robin Wright are talking with no accent at all. It's just enough strange to bother any listener except for Americans. Besides that, it's well made and Mara is as good as Noomi Rapace was, except for the fact that seeing the US version after the Swedish movie is rather awkward: because there is nothing new and astonishing in the latter. I repeat: it's a must to see it if you haven't seen the previous ones. Otherwise, you won't lose your money, but maybe your time.",8,0,6,28 August 2012
The Grand Budapest Hotel," Brilliant and funny
","I've just watched it on Netflix, several hours after the Academy Awards gave it 9 nominations. All of them are worthy. All the make-ups, costumes, design, photography, etc., is exceptional. It's beautiful, well-made and all this beauty is useful, serving the story. These craftsmen put all their talents to make this film unforgettable. We could watch it in 30 years, it'll be great forever. Besides, the film is a mix of comedy and a breathless thriller. Previous films by Wes Anderson were funnier, but the story was losing its interest after an hour or so. Here we have a story who's holding it all the way. It's impossible not to laugh even when M. Gustave is in jail. It's well written. In the end, the most interesting part of the film is the cast. Every member of it is good, and a lot of them are really great. They should have nominated Ralph Fiennes for his portrayal of the concierge of this old hotel. He's brilliant and funny and just for him, you have to see this movie. The first time I've seen him on a screen was in 'Schindler's list'. I've never thought I could watch a film in which he's so different and as good. He's a master.",9,4,7,15 January 2015
Lincoln," Like a great play with phenomenal cast
","Knowing that story quite well, and as a fan of Spielberg, I was expecting a lot from this film, that I saw after all the buzz following Academy Awards nominations. As many critics have reviewed, this is essentially a dialogue movie, people are talking all the time, sometimes in law babble. So the film is more like a theatre play, with very few scenes of real action. But it's a masterpiece in its genre. There are so much great performances in it that's impossible to signal them all. At least, I was moved a lot by many scenes with George Yeaman (Michael Stuhlbarg), Preston Blair (Hal Holbrook), Molly Lincoln (Sally Field), Robert Lincoln (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), Ulysses S. Grant (Jared Harris), Elizabeth Keckley (Gloria Reuben), W.N. Bilbo (James Spader), and of course, Thaddeus Stevens (Tommy Lee Jones). Not surprisingly: in all the scenes these great actors are sharing the screen with Daniel Day-Lewis. After seeing him in so many films where he was great, it seems almost impossible that this actor may get better. He is and it's a joy to watch. You must see this film, a history lesson.",9,2,5,18 January 2013
Groundhog Day," Aging well
","Saw it in 2011, and it's still rather funny. Most of the comedies of this period don't last long, because of the music, or the way it's done. Not the case here, it's still a perfect comedy after 18 years. Andie McDowel has never been as good as in this movie. Maybe with the exception for her performance in 'Four weddings and a funeral'. Bill Murray is also playing one of his funniest character. But the best part of this film is the screenplay. It seems that it was the first try by screenwriter Dany Rubin. He wrote the story, and did co-writing of the script with director Harold Ramis. I don't know which part of the success of this film is due to who, but it doesn't matter. There are so much incredibly laughable scenes in the film you can't count them. You won't regret it.",9,2,5,17 December 2011
The Blind Side," Great adaptation
","I've just watched this film. I read this story as written by Michael Lewis, which is very interesting to read also. Great book, very good movie indeed. I never thought Sandra Bullock, who is a star, could also be as good as she is in this role. Her performance is not spectacular, because her character is phenomenal, but she clearly understood the essence of Lee-Anne Twohy as described by Michael Lewis. I've enjoyed the film very much. I was expecting some dramatic Hollywood-twisted scenes without any link with the real story of Michael Oher, who is also a phenomenon by himself. But not. There are a couple of scenes when you can guess, even if you have not read the book, that are just too much. But it's made with a nice sensibility. And it's a true story, totally unbelievable. A screenwriter would have imagine this story, any producer would have dumped it. It's impossible to dislike this film. Just a small problem: for people who are not fluent in English, the Southern accent of Nashville characters is hard to catch. But it does not reduce the fun to watch it even if translated. This family is unique and their story was to be told.",9,1,2,11 January 2012
