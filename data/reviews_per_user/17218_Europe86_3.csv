Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Horrible, horrible movie
","I just don't know where to start.....this is a horrible, horrible movie that should have never seen the light of day. If 0 was available, then I'd give it 0 out of 10. This movie is so unfunny it's not even funny. You can clearly tell this movie was not filmed in Kazakhstan, only in a small, poor eastern/southern European village. Make some attempt to make the movie dialog sound as if the speaker came from Kazakhstan. You had Azamat speaking fluent Eastern Armenian while you had Borat mixing Polish, Russian and some other language. I am also offended the way they portraited Jews, Gypsies as well as women.This movie should be hidden in deep dungeons where no daylight will see it. It belongs there with the likes of Gigli and other horrible movies.",1,7,15,8 May 2007
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," Future is closer than we think.
","I find 'T3:Rise of the Machines' to be as good as 'T2:the Judgement Day' and way better than the original 'Terminator'. It is a bit funny as well and I do like the end of it. Afterall, not every movie has to have a good ending, right? I admit, I didn't see it coming. But it has a few flaws. One of them is the dialogue. That could have been done better. There were few other visible mistakes throughout the movie. I think they should stick with Eddie Furlong as John Connor. He was better in his role than Nick Stahl. And I think, in the opening part of the movie where they show John Connor as the leader of the resistance, Nick Stahl's make-up is done rather poorly. It is a sci-fi movie, but it is more real than we realize. True, when the original movie was made 20 years ago, it was all sci-fi, but now... what happened at the end may not be far fetched as we would like to think. Considering how our techology has developed, how the nuclear programs and war fare have advanced.......and how the things stand right now in the world....the future could be closer than we think.",9,1,1,13 December 2003
The Dirty Dozen," Americans were no better than the Nazis
","This movie is horrible. I am really disappointed by the way the producers showed Germans in here. According to the movie, all Germans were evil and they all had to be killed. I am not trying to excuse what the Nazis did, but this does not mean everyone was like this. Lots of Germans were actually opposing the totalitarian system of Adolf Hitler. The worst part is when you have all the people locked up in the bunker and the have the Americans throwing the grenades down the air vent, pouring the gasoline and blowing the whole thing up. This makes the Americans no better than the Nazis. I could actually live with it, if the three remaining Americans were also killed. 1 out of 10.",1,24,62,15 April 2007
