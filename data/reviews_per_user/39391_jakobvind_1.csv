Minority Report," **SPOILER ALERT**
","I hate to ruin a good discussion, but the ending isn't happy. By no means. SPOILER ALERT Cruise is put in jail, and the jailer says as he (Cruise) is put in the freezer something to the effect of: Get ready for the ride of your life. Now all your dreams will come true. So like Brazil, the unbelievable happy ending that comes after that scene(I mean really, it is just too perfect), is a fantasy. Not as in Gilliam's movie an homage to the human spirit and imagination, but a bleak nose-dive. The bad guys win!! Or am i wrong?Oh , by the way: 8 for a terrific and very clever action movie-",Null,0,0,8 October 2002
