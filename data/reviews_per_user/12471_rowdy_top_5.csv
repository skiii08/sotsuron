Blade Runner 2049," It's just boring
","If your standard poster for the movie is more exciting then the movie then you must know you are in trouble. I an absolute fan of the original. I own the 5 different versions and I love each one of them even the one with the Ford voice over. I wanted to like this one. I did not go and see it with high expectations but I was hoping to be entertained at best. That did not happen. I fell a sleep. The visuals are great but by todays standards that is not saying much. Compared to the original they are average never outstanding and never intriguing, to be honest who cares if you do not get a story that keeps you on your feet. I do not need a constant barrage of action to keep me interested. Personally I find most Marvel movies boring, mainly because of that. I get that this Blade Runner should appeal to an adult oriented audience, and believe me in age I am an adult, but the original can make you think, care and is always entertaining. 2 hours and 44 minutes does not make this a good movie and it sure does not make it art. It is doubtful to me that this will be a classic like the original even though that one needed years to be appreciated by the masses. It simply proofs that a sequel is not always required when a good story has been told.",5,3,7,28 May 2018
Troy," A boring waste of talent and money
","I must admit I wasn't looking forward to this movie but on the merits of its director I decided to give it a try. I did not expect a faithful adaption of homer's poem or anything that could match my imagination. What I wanted was a good film that would entertain me Hollywood Style. I was bored out of my skull! It amazes me that a skilled director like Wolfgang Petersen can not impress me when he launches a thousand ships or stages a massive battle. Even in scenes were grandeur isn't required and actors only have to act, I have to fight of morpheus and he's winning.Could it have been any good? It could have been. There was an ample budget, a good story, a smart director and obviously enough talented people to make a great film. Were it went wrong? No intensity in the play, no soul, no heart, just pyrotechnics.",5,0,1,26 March 2005
Thor: Ragnarok," Nice try but no Cigar
","First off: I am not familiar with the world of Thor in the comic books unlike the other MCU heroes. However I have seen the other 2 Thor movies and as such this is the best or at least the most entertaining one of the bunch. It leans heavy on the comedy side of things and there is the strength and the weakness of the movie. Obviously Marvel and Disney have found that it pays to be funny. Unfortunately they haven't got it completely right. And the fact that you have a truck load of money to waste on nothing doesn't mean you can make it any good. It's just plain lucky the other 2 were bad that in comparison this one looks better but in reality it is just average. Do not expect to be dazzled by the story, the visuals, the scenery or anything else you may want to be flabbergasted by. This is another one you have seen without having to see it. The formula gets old but I guess that as long as they cash in big time they will be made. There is nothing wrong with that but why not take a chance, try something different or just spent some time for a better story or at least a better dialogue. MCU movies are rapidly becoming fast food and that is a shame. If the production outcome is so generic what is the point to show up for the next in the Marvel franchise.",6,1,4,20 February 2018
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," These people could be my neighbors
","I like the premise and then the question 'Why would somebody do that?' The movie is filled with people you will like and dislike just like the people in real life. They have their nasty habits and some good qualities. Okay I admit, I have no friends that set police stations on fire or let themselves be beaten up. Being European I don't even have friends or know any people that own a gun. All true. I still identify with the characters here, their thoughts and emotions. I do not necessarily agree with them but I do understand. That is why I get involved in the story and start to care about the characters. Nothing new here with actors like McDormand and Harrelson, they understand their craft and do the job they are hired to do outstanding. The movie will make you smile, it will make you think but most of all it will make you feel.",8,1,3,20 February 2018
Black Panther," Much ado about nothing
","I do not understand the hype about this movie. It is made by competent people who know their craft and know how to elevate an average screenplay to a visual spectacle. Strip away the CGI and what have you got left? Well a standard script that works in Hollywood. Hero becomes king after tragic loss, hero is brave and honest, hero is immensely rich and then it is time for the fall and then of course he gets back on his horse and wins the day and gets the girl. The formula works with a twist here and there but nothing to testing. And it ends like other Hollywood dreams no matter how advanced and technically savvy the world they created is, it always ends up with a fist fight. 
It is not as comedic or refreshing as Deadpool or Guardians Vol1, it is better then Iron Man or most of the other MCU productions. It lacks a spirited hero, this one is bland at best. It has no awesome bad guy with great one liners. it features no memorable characters. Some good actors are here Forest Whitaker, Angela Basset, Martin Freeman and Andy Serkis but King Lear it is not. It is a comic book made into a movie and it has no deeper meaning then that. It will kill 2 hours and you won't get bored, a second or even a 3rd watch is a waste time.",5,5,8,20 February 2018
