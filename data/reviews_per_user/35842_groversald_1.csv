Vertigo," Love this flick! Gorgeous, haunting, classic!
","I recently re-discovered and fell in love with this movie. I'd seen it years before, but the first viewing didn't 'grab' me for some reason. It's one of my favorites now, though.Some viewers complain that the plot is too convoluted, doesn't make sense, etc., but I think the best approach is not to take it too literally, if that's possible for you. Just take it as someone's dream (or nightmare). If you're after an action movie or that sort of thing, it might be best to let that mood pass before watching Vertigo.Highlights for me: the Saul Bass credits, the opening rooftop chase, the psychedelic nightmare sequence, the gorgeous Bernard Herrmann music, the eerie art gallery scene. It's all great, though.",10,2,4,21 June 2004
