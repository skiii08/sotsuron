Black Swan," Portman hasn't been this good for many years.
",Audiences won't know who to trust and what is real in this terrifyingly great film that will grab hold of you until the final act.,8,0,0,23 March 2020
Milk," OK
","Milk presents details about the title character and his relevance... It captures the feeling of the city, and the events of Milk's life; but never captures the dynamic charisma that had to be a vital part of the man",6,0,0,20 March 2020
BlacKkKlansman," Sorry...
","This is not Spike Lee's best, a poor detective tale and simple-minded Millennial noir",6,3,5,19 March 2020
Capote," A quiet but hypnotic film that earns its nominations.
","The performance you'll see in 'Capote' is easily the best of the year. actually, the best of any year. It's one of those turns that'll be remembered for years to come, up with Welles in 'Citizen Kane', Brando in 'The Godfather' but Hoffman's conspicuously dapper turn as Capote shouldn't overshadow the murky, pervasively tense work of director Bennett Miller.",8,1,1,30 March 2020
Bohemian Rhapsody," Feel like a music video
","Title says it all. But I do like Remi's portray, he totally owns the role.",6,2,3,18 March 2020
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," Probably Cameron's best work.
",Set the standard for modern Hollywood's F/X-driven mega-productions and cemented James Cameron's dystopian vision as modern science-fiction's saga par excellence.,9,0,0,24 March 2020
No Country for Old Men," One of the best pictures of the year.
","No Country for Old Men is a great Texas film. It is great unequivocally, but Lone Star pride is a rare opportunity in Hollywood. And I never knew a man with that kind of haircut can be that scary.",8,0,1,22 March 2020
The Favourite," Olivia Coleman kept me watching.
","The Favourite is full of vibrant colors, opulent sets, lush costumes, blood oranges, tea cakes, and a world of sensory delights. But none of it is beautiful.",6,1,1,19 March 2020
Aladdin," Underrated
","Why critics don't like this film is beyond me. It's coloful, exciting, funny and full of amazing music, basically a perfect family film. Naomi Scott is the standout imo.",8,0,0,16 March 2020
La La Land," Love The Music
",Kinda irritated when the acadamy gave BP to moonlight boy coz this one is my best cinematic experience in 2016. What a shame.,10,6,8,17 March 2020
The Matrix Reloaded," A good action film.
",Action scenes are pretty amazing while the plot is bland.,7,1,1,7 April 2020
A Beautiful Mind," Not what I want but still worked.
","A Beautiful Mind reveals only glimpses of the dark story beneath its sunny imagery, but the performances carry enough weight for it to stand for something.",7,0,0,27 March 2020
The Departed," Scorcese at his best.
",Many people told me that they prefer the original than this one but not me. I think it got its unique style.,10,0,1,21 March 2020
Psycho," The film that fathers every other film.
","It's a shame that Hitchcock never got an oscar proving that sometimes, the acadamy is just a joke.",9,2,2,21 March 2020
There Will Be Blood," One of my all time favorite.
","Hallelujah to Paul Thomas Anderson's crazy talented mind that keeps pouring out amazing visions. Daniel Plainview, gloriously portrayed by Daniel Day-Lewis, is the most depressed human being I've ever seen. He genuinely hated everyone including himself which led him to his final miserable end. But it sure is fascinating to watch. And I kinda feel like this film questioned the christianity of Uncle Sam.",10,1,1,22 March 2020
Joker," I don't care what those critics say.
","Joker is one of the most, if not the most, exciting film of 2019. Phoenix has delivered such an amazing and sophisticated performance, Oscar well deserved. I'm don't agree with what the film is trying to tell us 100%, but I like the way they tell the story.",9,1,2,28 March 2020
The Shawshank Redemption," Andy Dufresne
","There are too many comments on The Shawshank Redemption, and almost everything has been said ten million times. In order to avoid repetition, I will not say words like 'hope' or 'freedom'. Of course, these are all very good, and they can also be felt from the movie the first time.Well, let me talk about another word I have ever felt, 'rational'. Andy's victory is the victory of reason, and Andy's success is the success of reason. No matter what the situation is, whether it is good times or bad times, he remains calm, silently assessing the situation and doing what he can to achieve his goals.This is a great talent!",10,0,0,17 March 2020
Mary and Max," Unusual friendship
","Ultimately, Mary and Max is about correspondence and lack of correspondence, about how our images and fantasies about others fail to match up to what they are like, and about the constitutive gaps and misfirings in any communicational practice.",8,0,0,25 March 2020
Mad Max: Fury Road," Awesome
","It's like an insane 80's B-movie, but one made with thought, effort, and enough of a budget to match its deranged aspirations.",9,0,0,26 March 2020
