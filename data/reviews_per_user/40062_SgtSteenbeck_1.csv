Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," Buckle-swashed!
","As this film had received some poor reviews in the press, I wasn't expecting too much. However, I was very pleasantly surprised! The story got off to a romping good start, was well paced, lots of Pirate Action, good sword fights, swinging on chandeliers etc , just what you want from a Pirate movie! The mermaids were also excellent. I saw it in 3D - and my only gripe is some of the action sequences were cut too fast. Fast-edits can work well in 2D, but in 3D can be disorientating.Johnny Depp, Geoffrey Rush and Kevin McNally were all on excellent form, as were new shipmates Pen√©lope Cruz and Ian McShane. McShane's Blackbeard was a worthy foil for Jack Sparrow and Barbossa. Worth mentioning, this Edward Teach bore no similarity to the friendly cap'n in Disney's 1968 movie Blackbeard's Ghost. Good to see Keith Richards - and also Richard Griffiths as King George. Don't believe any poor reviews. Hoist the Jolly Roger!",9,3,6,23 May 2011
