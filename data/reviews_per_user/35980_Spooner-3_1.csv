The Blair Witch Project," Perhaps the Greatest Horror Film Made
","Having heard rave advance reviews I decided to see the Blair Witch Project on its opening day.  I was hoping, but not expecting that it would be good. (Other than the Shining and about three other films, I've never liked or been scared by a horror film).  The film exceeded even my wildest expectations.  The script and premise are genius, and the acting and directing fully lived up to potential.  This horror film is unique in many ways.  One reason it works so well is its realism.  Everything that occurs could be either natural (a crazed serial killer or cult) or supernatural. The mockumentary footage is extremely believable in its amateurism.  The character development is perfectly believable.  It also scares you much more by NOT showing you anything.  My imagination kept me up until 5 am!  I strongly recommend this film, but I warn you that you may be seriously frightened for some time to come!",10,1,2,17 July 1999
