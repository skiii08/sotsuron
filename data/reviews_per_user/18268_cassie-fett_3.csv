Hereditary," Hollywood is running out of ideas.....
","Having just sat through this abysmal movie, I am at a loss for words to describe how truly terrible Hereditary was. If you want to watch Toni Colette run around carrying on, screaming & crying with her mouth open for 60 minutes, than this one is for you! Supporting actors were terribly weak whilst delivering rigid performances. It seems as if the writers/director regurgitated a variety of old school horror thrills, jumbled it all together and thought 'okay, this should work'. It didn't. Pass on this till it reaches cable, zero thrills, scares or shocks........as it is a flat out shocker!!!!!",1,7,16,19 June 2018
Us," Just no. A BIG FAT NO.
","I'm dumbfounded. Speechless. Unable to articulate my feelings towards the woeful cinematic experience I just had.I am forty years of age, watched a ton of movies in my time.......I can't think of a worse one.A nod to all of the actors, they were actually very good........must have been paid APLENTY!!!AVOID.",1,172,264,9 April 2019
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," 3 stars for Margot, Brad and Leo
","I was 14 years old when I sat down to watch the release of Pulp Fiction at the cinema. It was a significant moment as Tarantino set the bar for movie excellence.Hate to say, but Once Upon a Time fell flat. I was bored. Not sure of the direction Tarantino was heading, but the first two hours had zero plot. An unnecessary two hour filler to get to a half hour climax.Disappointing, but the actors were excellent. Brad Pitt carried the movie, he personifies old Hollywood glamour.",3,2,6,7 September 2019
