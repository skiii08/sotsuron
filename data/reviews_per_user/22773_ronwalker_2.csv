The Blair Witch Project," Edgey, raw and excellent!!
","This is one of the most frightening movies that I have ever seen.  While it is not 'shock value,' blood or special effects that scare the begeezus out of you, it is the 'true life' fear and terror that the people are going through that truly makes it so haunting.The study of 3 people who start out happy, energetic and full of vigor, being reduced to terrified, hunted and on the edge of insanity, is incredible to watch.  I truly felt as if I was invading someone else's private life and nightmare.Watch it and think 'what if it *IS* true!'",10,1,2,20 July 1999
Gladiator," Even Cecil B. Demille would be impressed!
","Perhaps the best work Ridley Scott has done.  He tells an engrossing story full of love, hate and honor.  He uses this vehicle to show the classic 'Ridley filming experimentation' with his camera techniques, but keeps the film moving along quite nicely, without letting the 'art' detract from the story.Russell Crowe is incredible as Maximus.  You can feel the audience rooting for him and absorbing the energy that he brings to the screenIn a film that could easily have become 'just another Braveheart wanna-be' in the hands of a lesser director, Ridley Scott creates a masterpiece that will be remembered for years.",10,0,0,6 May 2000
