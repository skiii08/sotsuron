Hereditary," One of the worst movies I have watched.
","Too many lengthy reviews so I'll keep it short.PRO
<ul><li>Decent acting from most characters. </li><li>Decent sound track which might create some tension. </li></ul>CONS
<ul><li>Terrible writing overall. </li><li>Movie build up was useless as to little of it anchors into explaining the story. </li><li>Like someone already mentioned, actions and scenes are laughable, I was one of the laughing people at how bad parts of the story and scenes were.</li><li>Since the little explanations don't create the idea the creepy things that happen could be real, it's hard to get scared by those unbelievable creepy things.</li></ul>In short it's hard to grasp what is going on during the movie. Bad story, bad explaining, long and dragging on way too long, bad character creation (not the fault of acting). It's the least scary movie I have ever seen so unless you're already faint of hard this is definitely not interesting.",1,2,6,13 October 2018
The Dark Knight," Batman Begins & Batman The Dark Knight
","I always hated the batman movies, I kinda like the comic books but the movies never appealed to me. I never planned on going to Batman Begins at first but when my mate asked me to go I thought I'd go for the fun anyway.I was totally surprised by the difference between the new movie and the older 3/4 movies. But because I didn't expect much of the movie due to the first couple of Batman movies I kind of thought that made it go up in my movie rankings list. I never ever thought they could do something like that again and I was completely wrong. I went to Batman: The Dark Knight, because my brother went and I thought I would just go along while being bored.I never ever could have hoped for a better movie. And first I wasn't blown away at all, but after the movie had finished and I started thinking about it, I first of all saw it a 2nd time and I still wanna go a 3th time. Most important of all, this movie made me want a 3th Batman movie from this same producer and I wanna go right for the premiere! Batman finally kicks ass!",10,9,19,23 August 2008
