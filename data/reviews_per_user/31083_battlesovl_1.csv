Ali," it wasn't terrible, but it wasn't great either...
","ali was ok, but it could've and should've been done better.  i think they should've packed in some more details about his life instead of just watching him run through africa and stuff.  the movie just sort of jumps from one thing to another.  sometimes i felt like they put a little too much emphasis on the people around ali.  the ending was abrupt.  i couldn't believe the movie was over just like that.  it was truncated.  i expected more.  i thought maybe they would show more towards the end of his career and when he started to develop parkinsons disease.  will smith did a pretty good job as ali, but the story needed work.  i give it 2 1/2 stars.",Null,0,0,29 December 2001
