E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," the story of Christ?
","after seeing 'close encounters' which i found hugely overrated i avoided Spielberg films.then i was encouraged to watch 'schiendlers list' which i think may be the greatest film ever.armed with this insight into Spielberg's work i went back to look at some of his earlier work.watching e.t. i was struck by the parallels with the story of Christ.i have not read all the reviews of this film on this site and i wonder if anybody else noticed.it would not be the first time a modern-i use the term loosely-children's story had been made this way.c.s. lewis's 'the lion,the witch and the wardrobe'probably being the best example although lewis always denied this.e.t.-the story of Christ.may sound crazy but think on for a moment and the similarities jump at you.ET arrives on earth with lights in the sky(the spaceship),Jesus arrives on earth lights in the sky(the angelic host).where did Elliot find ET?in a barn.where was Jesus first seen?in a stable.ET gathers a group of friends(the kids),Jesus gathers his apostles.ET is betrayed to the authorities by Elliot's mother,Jesus betrayed by Judas.ET captured,tortured and killed.same for Jesus.both rise from the dead.both leave the earth by ascending into the heavens(admittedly ET was in a spaceship).i have only seen this film once and there are probably may more examples.so next time you watch ET try it with this in mind.",Null,1,2,1 April 2007
"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"," magical
","'the lion,the witch and the wardrobe' was the first book that was read out to me in school.i was about 7 at the time and it transported me to a magical place and gave me a love of reading that has remained with me ever since(if you are reading this miss pilling please accept my heartfelt thanks).so when Disney decided to make this into a film i felt i had to see it.so i gathered up my 10 nieces and nephews,aged from 7 to 14, and made it their Xmas treat.parents had the night off as we included pizza beforehand.it cost a small fortune but it was worth every penny as they were transported to the new land of narnia.everyone of them loved something about the film.my 7 year old niece loved Mr tumnus and my 11 year old nephew,who i'm sure will become a horror addict,really liked the witch and her evil stare.my 13 year old niece couldn't get over the illogicality of a lamppost in the middle of the woods.i wouldn't explain just telling her to wait for 'the magician's nephew'.me,i loved it.i enjoyed the expanded battle scene,which in the book was very short,but here was well imagined.the acting i thought generally was very good,but Tilda swinton as the witch was perfect.why 9 and not 10? well i thought a few of the voices did not sit too well on the animations.ray winstone and dawn french as Mr and Mrs beaver sounded odd and i couldn't like Liam neeson as aslan.also the dwarf ginarrbrik i struggled to understand a few times.a bit picky i know but hey its my review.overall a great family film that does justice to a great book.recommended.",9,0,2,16 January 2008
Hot Fuzz," Dixon of dock green meets straw dogs
","a great British comedy but it might not travel too well internationally.London super-cop nick is promoted and sent to the west country for being too good at his job.he arrives in the village of sandford which is virtually crime free.but he thinks that under the peaceful surface dark forces may be at work.too many freak accidents occur and he thinks they might be murders.i wont say more.the jokes come thick and fast and you need to be on your toes to catch the visual ones plus all the nods to other films of the same genre i.e. the bear trap round the head in the nod to straw dogs.i liked the police station swear-box where words like sh*t and f**k were spelt with asterisk's but c*nt was spelt in full.the cast read like a who's who of British acting edward woodward,timothy dalton and jim broadbent to name but a few,and where else could you see veteran actress billie whitelaw toting a machine-gun.great fun",10,1,2,6 July 2007
Enemy at the Gates," bitterly disappointing
","when this film came out i was really looking forward to seeing it.finally 'the west' had got over the cold war and here was the chance to pay tribute on film to those russians who had fought and in millions died to defeat Hitler and his cohorts.the battle of stalingrad was the real turning point of world war 2.this film manages to turn one of the most dramatic moments of world history into a trite love triangle.there is no time-line to the film.the duel between the snipers is pure fiction.this film disintegrates into the snipers equivalent of one-a-side football, i.e. the German sniper is shot so the russians win the battle.one star for the opening river crossing and first battle,the rest is rubbish.",1,4,9,3 January 2008
