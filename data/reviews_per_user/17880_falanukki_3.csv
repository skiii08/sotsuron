Your Name.," I thought I loved it but then I watched it again
","When I first watched the film, I was bawling my eyes out even 40 minutes after the movie had come to its end. To my surprise, second round of this movie didn't awake any emotion in me at all.I think a movie succeeds if it manages to evoke emotion even after watching it several times. With Kimi no na wa I was actually more invested in the visual side and the soundtrack of the movie during the second time. Those things really are worth mentioning, because the movie's visuals are absolutely stunning. Def worth watching in HD if you just get the chance.However, the plot is kinda vague and I even got frustrated waiting for the end result. The movie felt like it was trying to go on - as if they were forcefully dragging the film to its end.It's still a solid eight, because when I first saw this film, I thought it had hit the jackpot.",8,0,1,21 December 2018
Bird Box," Yet another story of a mother and her two children
","Although Bird Box is based off of a famous novel written before 'A Quiet Place' I still struggle finding true originality from this film. The storytelling is rather slow and is mainly your typical one big journey and flashbacks -type of film, in which the triplet travels along a river.First half of the movie is rather interesting, taking place when the pandemonium started. But the plot itself falls kinda flat and the character development is rather poor. They're trying to build the mother to be cold and strong, but fail, for the character is filled with conflicts of interest. (Such as who she holds dear and how she interacts with other people)Unlike the statistics suggest, it's not actually a horror film - rather a thriller filled with mild violence. If you're expecting blood and guts, don't bother really.Bird Box isn't too original and it doesn't really give anything new to the genre, except for the really cool set up of something unknown that goes out making people want to kill themselvs. And trust me, it's not your average demon they're dealing with. Long story short, it could've been better and I would've loved to see some other characters' perspectives as well. (Fish Fingers etc).The ending falls flat, but it's a film worth seeing. In the end two hours might feel a bit too long, but it's a good 'horror' film for those, who aren't too keen on watching actual horror.",5,1,7,21 December 2018
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse," The best Spider-Man of this universe
","I have been waiting for a movie like this tome come into life. Into the Spider-Verse introduces you to a very believable character chart with their own flaws and virtues. Especially the young protagonist from Brooklyn, a boy bitten by a spider, feels very real and somehow ordinary; yet fascinating.Into the Spider-Verse excels in inter-textual references (memes, famous people etc) and almost over the top self-irony. This movie doesn't take itself too seriously and it's guaranteed to give you a couple of good laughs. On top of the humor the movie's visuals are nothing I've seen like ever before. The bright colors and a heartwarming message in the movie are something that I want to watch all over again.Spider-Verse is one of the best animated films of this century, I kid you not. Even though the movie stumbles at its own humor and supporting characters at times, it's still a strong and coherent piece. It's a representation of Spider-Man, the Spider-Man that we all love.It's the Spider-Man we should've had from the very beginning.",9,0,3,28 December 2018
