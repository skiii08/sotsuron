Raiders of the Lost Ark," Growing Old Waiting for DVD/s
","This is without any doubt in my mind the greatest adventure movie of all time. Here we are, at the tail end of 2002A.D. and still no DVD. I mean, what's the deal with that? A few years back, when I was the proud owner of a laser disc player (still do) it was said that this format is the wave of the future. Little did I know that laser discs went by way of the 8-track player. Nevertheless, thank the Lord Almighty that I own the Indiana Jones Trilogy on Laser because I'll probably be as old as some of the mummys in the tomb that Indiana Jones was sealed in with during Raiders of the Lost Ark before it comes out on DVD. I mean really!",10,0,0,22 November 2002
