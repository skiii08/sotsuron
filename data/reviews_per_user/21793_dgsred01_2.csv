Come and See," What a horrible way to experience life.
","Come and See (1985) by Alem Klimov, shows how a young man named Florya was so excited about joining the army, but once he was in it he found out that it was not pleasant at all. At the age of 12, he had to experience WWII, when the Jews were the target of the Nazis. Florya lost his innocence, family, and friends. The only thing that he did not lose was the willing of keeping himself alive. Klimov did a great job showing how the war affected Florya's emotional feelings, how he started aging little by little in front of the camera. The movie is not so much about the graphics of the Holocaust, but how the war affected people's mind and feelings. The movie shows the cruel reality how young boys have the wrong idea why they want to join the army, but once they experience war they really find out the answer why they are fighting for. Almost at the end of the movie, Florya shot the photo of Adolph Hitler with a rifle, and it was a way for him to take all that pain and anger he had inside. He felt that he found a reason why to keep fighting against the Nazis. Florya felt the right to defend himself against people who wanted to hurt him.",Null,1,1,9 December 2007
Life Is Beautiful," What a wonderful story.
","I just watched this movie last week, and it really touched my heart. It was not about the Holocaust and how Jews were killed or tortured, but instead it was how love can keep the spirit alive to go through tough times. Roberto Benigni did a wonderful job playing the character of Guido. I was so impressed to see how nothing was impossible to Guido. His hyper personality got him in trouble all the time, but his spontaneous personality helped him to find quick solutions in a very intelligent way. Guido showed us how he devoted himself to his son, even though they were in a terrible situation. He used humor and jokes to protect his son from minimizing the horrible reality that him and his family were going through at the concentration camp. Even at the most bitter moment he sweetened everyone's and his son's life with a joke or a smile. It was really shocking to me that right before Guido was killed he made sure that his son was safe and he was still joking and smiling even though he knew that he was going to be killed. This movie was made so beautifully that I strongly recommend it to anyone to watch it.",10,12,19,9 December 2007
