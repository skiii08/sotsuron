Casablanca," Best Screenplay ever!
","One of the landmark Hollywood films. It started a whole new wave of directing and writing. Probably the best screenplay of all time, people find themselves quoting it without even knowing it. The film about a love that was never meant to be between Rick (Humphrey Bogart) and Ilsa (Ingrid Bergman). Besides the two leads their are also good performances by Peter Lorre, Paul Heinreid, Dooley Wilson, Conrad Veit, and Claude Rains in the performance of a lifetime as the corrupt police chief of Casablanca. The film is dark and beautiful. The wonderful action blends beautifully with the lovely performances. Not many scenes can top the foggy scene on the airstrip at the film's climax. I don't think it's the (AFI) second best film of all time (Gone With The Wind, Psycho, Godfather, and Citizen Kane are better)but it still a must see!",Null,0,0,4 September 2001
Gone with the Wind," The ultimate piece of cinema
","GWTW is possibly the greatest film of all time. It neatly blends acting, script and beautiful art direction into a stunning film. Not many movies can hold your attention for four hours and this can. Vivien Leigh deliveres a powerhouse performance which is quite possibly the greatest of all time. She never loses her momentum despite the fact she is on screen in almost every scene. Together with Clark Gabel, Leslie Howard, and Hattie McDaniel she creates the ultimate Hollywood picture. GWTW is revolutinary also in it's brilliant use of color and art direction as well as landmark special effects. I give Gone With the Wind a 10 out of 10 and should be higher on both the AFI's list and IMDb's.",10,1,2,6 July 2001
Psycho," Quite possibly the greatest film of all time!
","'Psycho' stands alone in the realm of horror and thriller movies. It is one of the few that delivers to fear and feeling into the misbegotten souls of it's characters. Director Alfred Hitchcock delivers superb direction and forces you to put your trust in 'Psycho''s many seedy characters. Anthony Perkins delivers the performance of a lifetime as Norman Bates, the poor pawn of his 'mother'. The film, brilliantly shot in B&W, has become a staple in any movie lover's eye. The entire story revolves around the theft of 400,000 by one Marion Crane(Janet Leigh). This theft entangles her sister(Vera Miles), her lover(John Gavin), a private eye(Martin Balsam), a sheriff(John McIntire), and a lonely hotel manager(Perkins). 'Psycho' is capable of being rewatched over and over again with little secrets hidden through out. Each character holds some secret: Marion stole some money, Gavin is seeing her on the side, Marion's coworker took tranquilers on her wedding night, her boss has alcohol in the office, client holds undeclared money from the IRS, and Norman has the biggest sequel of all. 'Psycho' also contains the greatest score of all time which contains only strings which was wonderfully composed by the late Bernard Hermann as well as the best directed scene of all time, the infamous shower scene. I believe 'Psycho' is the greatest film of all time. I give it a 10/10.",10,2,5,8 July 2001
