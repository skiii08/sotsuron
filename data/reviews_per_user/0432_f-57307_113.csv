Raiders of the Lost Ark," classic movie
","The reason why classics are classics is that they can be submissive at any time.

Se7en," worth watching
","Gloomy and hopeless. Christianity uses Satan's seven demons to represent seven sins: arrogance, jealousy, anger, laziness, greed, overeating, and lust. A perverted religious killer usually does not even kill a chicken, but he finds a basis to carry out a creepy murder on people. What could be more horrible than the act of a devil alone?

The Great Dictator," classic movie
","As Chaplin's first sound film, its influence has gone beyond a film. However, because of the age, the laughter and the story bridge are not very attractive in my opinion, because the film was shot in the most arrogant era of the Nazis. It is courageous.

","Joaquin Phoenix's performance is very emotional, expressing pain with an uncontrollable giggling, making people sad. The film is very different from most previous superhero movies, with no special effects, no spectacles, or even too many action scenes.
