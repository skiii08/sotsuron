Raiders of the Lost Ark," classic movie
","The reason why classics are classics is that they can be submissive at any time.

Se7en," worth watching
","Gloomy and hopeless. Christianity uses Satan's seven demons to represent seven sins: arrogance, jealousy, anger, laziness, greed, overeating, and lust. A perverted religious killer usually does not even kill a chicken, but he finds a basis to carry out a creepy murder on people. What could be more horrible than the act of a devil alone?

Memento," it took a few more readings to understand
","The magical editing makes the story content show a variety of strange paths.

The Great Dictator," classic movie
","As Chaplin's first sound film, its influence has gone beyond a film. However, because of the age, the laughter and the story bridge are not very attractive in my opinion, because the film was shot in the most arrogant era of the Nazis. It is courageous.

","A masterpiece of non-linear narrative film. Ingenious and meaningful structure, wonderful dialogue. Everyone in the film has beautiful qualities, but they are hopelessly moving towards darkness and confusion.

Joker," great!!!
","Joaquin Phoenix's performance is very emotional, expressing pain with an uncontrollable giggling, making people sad. The film is very different from most previous superhero movies, with no special effects, no spectacles, or even too many action scenes. But in a slightly retro way, tell why the clown became that clown. In fact, it is a very serious film, including paying attention to social issues.
