Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," Best since The curse of the black pearl
","The last two Pirates of the Caribbean have been alright, but nowhere close to the first one. When i saw the previews for this movie I thought it was not going to be good at all. I then when to see it and I thought it was very good. It was better than Dead Man's Chest and a lot better than At World's End. I thought by taking out the Will Turner and Elizibeth Swan was a good idea because it brought new blood into the movies and didn't make it seem like a crappy sequel,but a whole new movie. This Pirates of the Caribbean was definitely as good as the first one. When I saw the movie it kinda started out slow for me,but it then quickly picked up the pace with Blsckbeard and his daughter. It had lots of laughs. Johnny Depp out did himself in this one.",Null,0,1,23 May 2011
