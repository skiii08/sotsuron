Requiem for a Dream," Like being repeatedly punched in the back of the head by Mike Tyson
","It's difficult to know what to say about Requiem For A Dream. I first saw it in the cinema when it was released in England and I have never seen an audience react to a film like this one. The climactic sequence, where the protagonists are effectively destroyed by their addictions, seemed to trigger a bout of heavy breathing in the audience. As it was ending I heard a few people crying. My girlfriend and I didn't say a single word to each other on the bus home.I bought the film on DVD the day it came out, but it took me around six months to watch it again. And only then because a friend of mine was curious. If anything, the impact was heavier than the first time I watched it and I've vowed never to watch it ever again.Yet I have still awarded a rating of 10 on imdb and would definitely assert that it's one of the three greatest films I have ever seen. Why? The acting is just amazing. Jennifer Connolly gives the best performance of her career (not too tricky considering the movies she's been in) and remains stunningly beautiful (in a haggard sort of a way) and noble even when she's roped into a gang bang to fund her heroin habit. Jared Leto annoyed me intensely in Fight Club but he's perfect as hapless junky Harry - forever exuding an air of kindly incompetence that endears him to the audience but that will ultimately destroy him. Marlon Wayans is equally brilliant - wearing a beaming smile for the first half of the film and a compelling look of confusion and betrayal for the rest of it.As for Ellen Burstyn... never has an actress been so unfairly cheated out of an Oscar (and I've seen the atrocity that won Marcia Gay Harden that Oscar for). She is just the picture of sadness the whole film through - a heartbreaking example of what loneliness can do to vulnerable people. The scene where she complains to Harry about being old is honestly one of the most tragic things I've ever seen and it makes me want to break down just thinking about it.As such, I can only recommend this incredibly important movie with certain reservations. If your favourite film is 'You've Got Mail' steer well clear. If 'Snow Dogs' has been your most thrilling cinematic experience of this year then put this film back on the shelf. Trust me, it'll save the costs incurred by those expensive therapy sessions.However, if you believe that cinema is an important tool in helping us understand ourselves and that we will only achieve self awareness by plumbing the absolute depths of despair and self-destruction then you must watch Requiem For a Dream.",10,622,684,30 January 2002
Training Day," Whoa!!! PIPE down there DENZEL!!!
","What's great about Training Day is that it never goes too far over the top. Judging by some of the comments already posted on this page, there are a lot of people who disagree with me on this one. But I thought the whole movie was nicely restrained, right up until the climax (is this review beginning to read like a write up for a high class porn flick?).Yes, yes, so Denzel Washington spends MOST of THE film TALKING like THIS (!!!!), his eyes continually twinkling with a mixture of mischievousness and raw insanity. But if there's one actor who you don't mind over acting, then it's Denzel. Imagine Al Pacino in the same role - although Al would definitely have looked even more ridiculous than Washington going round calling everyone his 'DAWG' and Ethan Hawke his 'nigga'. Did Washington deserve the Oscar for this film... yeah, kind of... well, no... he just deserved the Oscar that he didn't win for Malcom X.Yet the whole time I was watching Training Day I just knew the final scenes would spoil it. I knew that Hollywood conventions would dictate that the film had to end with Washington and Hawke beating the living be-jaysus out of each other, sustaining several gun shot wounds and facial injuries in the process.Yet the final fight was really well staged, not asking the viewer to really believe that scrawny Ethan Hawke could really batter big buff Denzel. I mean, earlier in the film they asked us to believe that Ethan Hawke (a man whose eyelids look like they're on loan from Droopy Dog) had never schmoked the demon weed before... C'mon.Training Day is an interesting study in nihilism and is largely about, as another user has already commented, how important a set of rigid set of ethics should be to the public servants sent out to protect us. Yet the film never really resolves this issue - Ethan Hawke's character is shown to be deeply principled but largely unable to do his job because of his lack of street savvy and pragmatism, while Washington's Alonzo is shown to be resourceful and charismatic but ultimately careless and evil. So who does the screenwriter think should be patrolling the streets: Ethan? Denzel? Dr Dre (who's actually not as bad as you'd think)?Needless to say, I won't be signing up to join the LAPD just yet...",8,0,11,8 April 2002
Saw," What he said...
","Jason is right, there is little else to add. So why am I posting? Well, because I feel a little cheated that a film that was so slick in some aspects, was so ridiculously slack in others.Continuity errors a-go-go! The lighting keeps changing in the 'cell'. Why? Objects disappear, reappear and spawn in areas they almost certainly weren't left in. Cary Elwes' feet TOTALLY change colour (all the way up to the ankle...) ala Bruce Willis' vest in Die Hard. Bruce sweats and shoots terrorists, Cary sits on his backside complaining. It's all just a bit lazy. The whole thing resembles a cross between Seven (and if you're going to rip Seven off then you better make it goooood) and the Crystal Maze (a frightfully camp old task based British game show). Some of the acting is shocking (Monica Potter, please retire. You are beyond rubbish). Some of the dialogue is really duff (especially Zach's spirited defence of the cancer patient's personality). It's just not a very well made sadistic fantasy...But it kind of works. An old man sitting behind me gasped once and hurried out of the exit. I'm guessing he wasn't shocked by the poor pacing and inconsistent lighting...The whole experience left me rather 'saw'...",Null,0,1,4 October 2004
Any Given Sunday," The finest film about sports ever made
","Let's get a couple of things straight:I'm a 'limey' through and through, and know next to nothing about 'Football'. In Britain, most people consider 'Football' (I use inverted commas because we Brits call soccer 'football', too) to be a tamer version of rugby, played by wusses who are have to hide behind acres of padding. Anyone who continues to think that after watching this movie is clearly quite demented.My only experience of 'Football' before this was playing John Madden's Football on the Playstation, so I never thought a good movie could be made about the sport. Even under the capable guidance of Oliver Stone.
BUT Any Given Sunday is so well acted, so incisive in its handling of the financial and ethical pressures facing the sport, and so brilliantly directed that I will NEVER get tired of watching it.Jamie Foxx is especially surprising, notably in his showdown scene with Al Pacino, perfectly portraying the attitude and idiosyncrasies of an arrogant young hot head who had been catapulted to fame almost by accident. In English Football we have plenty of players just like this.Even Al Pacino is great, and I normally hate the guy (if I want to hear a tired looking man shout at me incoherently, then I'll walk into a bar and spit beer in the bartender's face). However, you definitely don't need to be interested in sports to enjoy this frenetic, amazing film. The match scenes are closer to the battle scenes in Gladiator then to any other sports film. As you would expect from Stone, the focus of his film (i.e. a fictional football league) is a microcosm for American society and no stone is left unturned; racism, corruption, heroism, self-destruction, greed, power... it's all there. If you don't watch this movie, damnit, you don't deserve eyes. And if you do watch it, then remember to shield your peepers for the sickening injury scene right at the end... Ouch...",9,1,2,8 April 2002
