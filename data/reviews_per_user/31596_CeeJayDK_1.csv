Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Overrated , over-hyped and juvenile.
","I've long been a fan of Sacha Cohens other character Ali G , and his gay Austrian character Bruno is also a lot of fun to watch.So I watched this expecting to be greatly entertained , especially with all the hype that was going around. I was sadly disappointed .. In fact VERY disappointed.The humor in the film is nothing but crude slapstick comedy mixed with bad antisemitic jokes. I'm perfectly aware that Cohen is Jewish , and that he's really making fun of the idiots who agree with Borat , but that still doesn't make it funny.The jokes are so predictable they can be spotted way before they are executed. There are no surprises in this film. The only surprise to me was how many could love such a lame movie.",1,21,43,14 December 2006
