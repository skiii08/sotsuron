Requiem for a Dream," not better than 'Trainspotting'
","It wasn't till a saw it on IMDb 250 list that I found out about 'Requiem for a Dream.' I was even surprised that for such a moviegoer like me this title had somehow slipped from my sight; we are talking about #45 on the top 250 list. Needless to say I had to see it. My first impression is that is overrated. There is no way this movie is better than 'Trainspotting.' No way; which doesn't mean that is not a good movie. In fact is one of the most disturbing movies I've seen. The sound editing was breathtaking. The truth is that I felt sick at the end, that's how disturbing it was. Which again doesn't mean that it was a great movie. With the exception of the sound and camera editing, it felt like documentary. One of the major flaws of the movie with the exception of Ellen Burstyn was that it wasn't given a clear explanation as to why the people in the movie got hooked on drugs in the first place. It would've been so much better. Again with the exception of the Burstyn's character it wasn't clear what our people dreamt about. Nevertheless, it was an experience and a memorable one, which is what movies are all about. The dialogue between Burstyn and Leto (mother and son) was astounding. I was entertained though not in the conventional sense. It moved me. Recommended.",Null,0,1,6 September 2003
The Ring," enough suspenseful and disturbing
","This was not a bad movie. It had enough suspense and disturbing scenes. The horror was just fine for me-not too extreme like 'The Evil Dead', 'Zombie', and Biohazard-kill and eat them all kind of movies but rather mysterious and even cerebral. I have to say I liked it. It has its weak points, but it doesnft fail to hold your attention till the end.The film is about killer videotape: the one who watches it immediately receives a telephone call with a voice just saying 'Seven Days'. Seven days after this phone call, you die. Rachel Keller (Naomi Watts) after seeing the tape has to save her life within those seven days. Intriguing enough isn't it. And not just the plot but also the camerawork, photography and the whole decor were fantastic. I will just say that I was looking forward to see the content of this videotape and to my opinion it was awesome-one of the creepiest things Ifve ever seen. However, there were some flaws Ifd like to share with those who saw the movie already:***SPOILERS AHEAD***First of all, Who builds a house over a well? We don't where I come from that's for sure. But this is a small one. A major flaw is the reasoning behind who lives after seeing the tape and who dies. In the movie Rachel made a copy of the tape and destroyed the original. Believing that making a copy keeps you alive she made her son make a copy of his own. The last line from that movie was when he asked her what was going to happen to those they were going to show the tape to. If we conclude that in order to stay alive you have to make a copy of the tape plus show it to somebody else, everything could end very fast. They just have to show the tape to somebody (say with AIDS, cancer, 90 years old or just anybody) and then destroy it.
But maybe itfs just me who canft understand. Overall it is entertaining. Give it a try.",Null,0,1,21 July 2003
Minority Report," fair
","The first time I saw 'Minority Report' I didn't like it at all, and since Cruise is my favorite actor and Spielberg is one of my favorite filmmakers I gave this movie a second chance. Well, the second time I kind of liked it. It was OK. Overall, the movie is a bit overproduced. Plotwise was basically nothing. A guy who has to clean his name by going back to his former job to get some prove for his innocence. And surely the end fell short big time. Everything was so over explained. What saves the movie are the (what would be the right epithet) breathtaking visuals-nobody does it like Spielberg. Cruise is also as usual great; no matter how much people criticize him and ascribe his success only to his face, with every movie Cruise proves his talent. He manages to give individuality and character to each of his heroes that he plays whether action, romantic, evil or cripple. I would dare to say that he is the best actor among those of his generation and these of the younger one.
I definitely think that this is a must see, no doubt about that. You don't wanna miss the teaming of the best selling director and actor in the world. 11 stars for special effects, overall 7.5 stars out of 10.",Null,0,1,26 August 2003
The Big Lebowski," this is like my opinion, man
","I divide the comedy genre movies in three groups: the first group consists of movies similar to 'The Big Lebowski' style of movies. Here are also 'Analyze This', 'White Men Canft Jump' as well as all Eddie Murphyfs and Jim Carreyfs movies. Those films are build on some kind of plot and most of all clever and funny dialogues. In the second group are kind of movies similar to 'Monty Python', 'Top Secret!' and all David Zucker's movies, 'Brain Donors', 'Hot Shots!' and the like, to say movies without clean-cut plot just a bunch of unrealistic and meaningless situations accompanied by even more meaningless and irrelevant dialogues. And the third group is only occupied by Charlie Chaplin the true genius of movie making and acting and just everything.But letfs get back to 'The Big Lebowski' (TBL). To me this movie is probably the best one in its group. It is such a funny flick. If you are lucky enough to see it with friends you gonna say to each other those vivid dialogues and expressions for months to come. Just check out the TBL memorable quotes on IMDb; I think it has the biggest number than any other movie on that side. Every single word was hilarious. And Jeff Bridges man, the greatest. I remember watching him in 'Arlington Road' after TBL and Ifve got to tell you I couldnft help myself but picturing him with a goatee, a potbelly, a ponytail and a pair of those huge Bermuda shorts drinking White Russian and smoking pot. It ruined the whole movie-'Arlington Road' I mean. One of the most memorable characters created on screen after Chaplin's tramp. OK overdid it. And of course John Goodman.
I suggest you stop reading and run off to the nearest video shop and even buy the movie. I envy you for the great time you gonna have watching it. On a second thought this one gets even better with every viewing. And don't forget to bring your friends along. It's double the fun.",Null,0,1,21 July 2003
As Good as It Gets," can't get any better
","It can hardly get any better. I must have seen this movie more than four times and every time is as entertaining as it was the first time I saw it. It's such a great movie. And it's all about Jack Nicholson-he is the man what can I say. Such an actor. I don't think that even DeNiro or Pacino could have played this particular character as flawlessly as Nicholson. This was an Oscar performance from top to bottom and of course he got it.
The message that this movie sends is that love is the best cure for any kind of disease-it can come at any time, place and age to heal you and give you a new life. Even for a 'crazy f***' like our hero love helps. The only shortcoming of this movie was that money was also involved. But I guess this is life: everything comes at a price. And probably the easiest and sometimes only way to get love is to buy it. C'est la vie. Great supporting performances from Greg Kinnear, Helen Hunt and Cuba Gooding Jr. and especially Greg Kinnear. Not to forget the dog yeah, he was one of the main contributors to the beauty of this masterpiece. There is no way one could go wrong with this movie, no way. You gonna love it. This one is in my top 10 list. 10 from 10 stars.",Null,0,1,12 August 2003
Memento," a Memento of a good movie
","And again-how do you define a good movie. It is a tough question isnft it? One can always find flaws in any film, book, painting or any piece of art or in just about anything. Nothing is perfect. Our lives are full of bull s*** nonsense as we screw up all the time. I mean wefve seen it all. No matter what you do, how great you are or amazing things you do, there will always be somebody who will say: gSo what?h and he will be right. The Matrix was done before, the Star Wars were done before but so what; there will always be The Matrix (the first one) and Star Wars (the first trilogy), as there will always be Memento.Itfs not like it didnft have some flaws, but come on nothingfs perfect. It is a very well crafted film with some great camera work and sound-Pearcefs voice as well as the whole music especially at the end were so right. Speaking of Guy Pearce a thing that this was an Oscar winning performance, not that I recognize this award very much anyway but he was awesome in this role. Not the plot itself, but the way it was executed (the all backwards thing) was also just great. I know that it was done before but so what. This mosaic was good. Ifm gonna stop praising this one for itfs for you to decide whether is good or bad.And as a  memento of  those 113 min spending watching this movie will be the recognition that we all lie to ourselves whether intentionally or not (in the case of Lenny intentionally) in order to give ourselves some purpose. I donft think that it automatically means it will make us happy as it was suggested from the film. However, we do alter or if you want adjust our memories and why not beliefs in order to give meaning to our very short lives.",Null,0,3,14 July 2003
12 Monkeys," ultimate time travel movie
","This one is definitely on the list of one of my most favorite movies. One part has to do with that I like movies dealing with time travel and end of the world kind of stories with sceneries of destroyed buildings and empty cities. But the other part is because of the sheer merits that this movie has in terms of screenplay, cinematography, cast and just about everything.The film is about a convict (Bruce Willis) sent back in time to find the source of a deadly virus that caused the extinction of 5 billion people in 1996. Sent back to the wrong year he ends up in a mental institution where he meets the beautiful Madeleine Stowe and the insane Brad Pitt. I never imagined that I would say those words but gBrad Pitt can actually act and act greath. Unfortunately I never repeated them again. However, it was a very memorable performance. I liked the eyes. Bruce Willis was also great in his role sometimes reminding of the all thrashed, bleeding character from the Die Hard series. And the whole show rolls over and it will not loose the grip till the final credits. This film is not to be seen because of being a fan of Willis or Pitt. This movie is to be seen because this is what a good Sci-Fi movie and not only Sci-Fi movie is all about - clean cut story, superb cinematography, and a very solid performance from the whole cast and especially by Brad Pitt. Highly recommended.",Null,0,0,16 July 2003
The Notebook," behind every love there is a story (forget the great)
","The reason I saw The Notebook was because I really liked Rachel McAdams in Wedding Crashers. She is a doll, isn't she? Rachel was so good in Wedding Crashers so I wanted to see her in another movie.To tell you the truth I'm not quite sure about this one. The Notebook is definitely not a great movie  that's for sure. I haven't read the book but I got the feeling that the director was picking from different passages of the book in order to give us maximum information in a very limited time. I am referring to the second act with all the many short stories  the war, house, new boyfriend and girlfriend, and so on and so on. The acting was also not that good. Rachel in a way was OK but Ryan Gosling acted too boyish for this role. There wasn't a good chemistry between the 2 leads. The whole cast with the exception of the old Noah wasn't convincing. Not to mention the ending was so very contrived.However this is a love story and as such some fantasies are allowed. From a bird's view this is a film about the time old question: should one follow the heart or should one follow the head? Which body organ is more reliable when making decisions? Choosing between what's good for the soul or what's good for the body. Passion or reason. Ideal versus money. Tough question I know. But what I know is that the movie also won't give you a convincing answer. I guess there isn't one.There are other good love stories out there that are much better than The notebook. One that comes to mind from the new ones is The Constant Gardener. The Notebook is a romantic melodrama that has its moments I guess. If it so happens that you might even cry, take a look at yourself in the mirror, take your time and think what's wrong withyou.6 stars out of 10",6,3,5,20 January 2006
Finding Nemo," stream of color & lights
","One of the best animation I've seen in a long time. I wouldn't call it a classic but nevertheless was such a delight. Colors, lights, movements, graphics, story, everything. In order to get the best experience one should see it on the theaters otherwise you gonna miss maybe half of the entertainment. Being separated from each other father fish (Marlin) and son fish (Nemo) are trying to reunite. Marlin finds Dory-to me the most memorable an adorable character with Ellen DeGeneres' voice-and the rest is just train of different adventures with a lot of action (probably too much for a Disney film) and funny jokes (probably not enough for a Disney film). I would say that is a bit overrated but it's a nice animation after all-good for all ages. Recommended. 7.3 out of 10 stars",Null,0,0,11 August 2003
How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days," watch it with your girl (boy) friend
","I set about watching this movie with tons of reservations-I expected the worst. I mean starting from the title itself in combination with Matthew McConaughey it didn't look like the best choice for the evening. And what can I tell you: it wasn't as bad as I thought it would be.The plot at first glance seems completely contrived, bout on a second thought it looks plausible: a girl how has to make a guy break up with her in 10 days and a guy who has to make a girl fall in love with him in 10 days. And here they meet. Possible don't you think? And the rest was a lot of both Kate Hudson and Matthew McConaughey in overacting mood. Too sleazy. Anyway, as I said I expected so much worse. With the exception of the end, which looked like the creators of the movie wanted to just finish the film as fast as possible, the rest was acceptable. 6.5 stars out of 10.
P.S. It would be double the fun if you watch it with your girlfriend (boyfriend).",Null,0,0,16 October 2003
The Others," overrated
","I will be brief with this one. First of all, I thing that one is pretty much over rated. To me 'The Ring' is a better horror, creepy, scary movie than 'The Others.' I will not compare the latter one with 'The Sixth Sense' for the unquestionable superiority of the Shyamalan's masterpiece. Secondly, if you remove the whole screaming and crying there will be nothing much left to scary you. Thirdly, everything was unfolding toooo slow. Endless dialogues and needless scenes in order to extend the running time.Nevertheless, taking into consideration that even though done with virtually no special effects  (which is not what you'd expect hearing about a movie dealing with a creepy house and ghosts) it managed to keep the tension; together with the very good performance from the entire cast and especially the little girl (Alakina Mann), kind of save the film. The twisted end also worked for me - I didn't see it coming (probably, I was too bored with the slow pace to expect anything). I guess I would recommend this movie to all those who like creepy suspense films with twisted endings-well, not recommend but more like suggest to try to see. I hope you won't be disappointed. 6.5 stars out of 10",Null,0,1,26 August 2003
Full Metal Jacket," shouldn't be in the top 250 list
","The first time I watched 'Full Metal Jacket' to be honest, I couldn't finish it that how boring I thought it was. When I saw it on the IMDb's list of top 250 movies occupying the 97 place I thought I must've missed something so I decided to give it another try. Well, it was still painful to watch - boring. I guess I couldn't understand Kubrick's genius. With the exception of '2001: A Space Odyssey' (actually the part in the space only) I couldn't enjoy none of his other movies. His last movie was relatively OK just because Tom Cruise is my favorite actor. Anyway, let's get back to the 'FMJ.'There are two main acts in this movie: the first one took place in an American military training camp and the second one in Vietnam. The first part was extremely boring and annoying lacking any message or idea  meaningless. The suffering of the fat guy and the weird way he turned suicidal were so unconvincing and pointless. Half of the movie was devoted to this guy and his fat a**. The second half of the movie was at least more dynamic, but equally pointless. The two scenes with the Vietnamese prostitutes were so incoherent and unnecessary. No, there is no need to continue this review. This movie is way overrated; hell, I think that it shouldn't be even in the IMDb's list. I wouldn't recommend it. 'Rambo II' was easier to watch. 5 stars out of 10.",Null,0,1,12 September 2003
Fargo," the ultimate black comedy

One of the best Coen brothers' movie probably second best after 'The Big Lebowski' for this one is my weakness. The thing with 'it is a true story' worked for me perfectly. That's how I saw it which pretty much enhanced the overall perception. And I donft understand why some people complain about Coen brothers' way of manipulating. Everything was so realistic in this movie. The characters weren't very bright fellows doing not so well thought out things as how in real life is. Great performances from Steve Buscemi, Frances McDormand and William H. Macy and especially Macy. If Marge was the soul of the movie then Jerry was its brain?!? I guess. You could actually see him at the end crumbling down from the weight of his lies wanting to go to some place safe just to have a break for a while. Beautiful. So realistic as it's so simple. Great Coen brothers, great William Macy. He should've gotten the Oscar.I can't tell what's exactly the genre of this movie but if I had to categorize it I would say it is a black comedy.

","'The Bourne Identity' is one of the best action, thriller, popcorn whatever moves Ifve seen in a long, long time. It is such a fun to watch. It has everything: martial arts and car chase hundred times better than in 'The Matrix Reloaded', cool chick that could actually act and most important of all it had that feeling of realism. Yea that's right realism something unusual for such movies.Matt Damon is an amnesiac who happens to be one of CIA's top assassins. Till he figures that out he has to deal with a whole bunch of people who want him down. Virtually, everybody in this movie tries to kill him. But that's OK for as I sad the film is still realistic as a film can be. Matt Damon contributes a lot to that feeling. Solid performance. I especially liked the scene at the American embassy when he came down from the roof like alpinist. No music, just him and the wall. It might sound crazy but I liked it.The whole movie basically is about nothing; has no heroes and no bad guys, it goes nowhere. It won't-make-you-think kind of movie. Pure entertainment.

The Matrix Revolutions," we can all rest now
","The only reason I've started writing reviews in the first place was that I wanted to see how good I was in writing essays and since I really like movies the selection of IMDb as my tribune of choice came quite naturally. This, to my modest opinion, is the best site on movie reviews. And now I am here in from of my computer trying to write something about the final sequel of a trilogy that caused probably the biggest excitement in the movie world since the Star Wars trilogy. I don't remember experiencing something as ... indescribable as the moment in the first Matrix when Neo took the red pill. The following 10 minutes or so were moviemaking at its greatest (the closest emotional experience that I can remember were the last 10-15 minutes of the movie 'Vanilla Sky'-in a different way though).Then came the second Matrix, which was quite a disappointment to me. When I think back again I realize that the first Matrix raised the bar to the highest possible level, which didn't allow for such a short period to come up with a sequel that would live up to the origin. And again, the mistake with the second one was entirely mine-I shouldn't have watched the movie more than once. And now comes the great finale. As I (we all I believe) have set about watching this one with much, much lower expectations, not really caring much about Neo, Trinity, Morpheus and the rest of the gang, just simply waiting for the grand finale, I have to say I was completely contented, maybe not on 100% but nevertheless, satisfied enough.

Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," MUCH better than was expected
","The key to T3 is not to go in with high expectations; think of it as it's going to be like 'The Matrix Reloaded'. The outcome, at least for me, was that I wasn't disappointed. It is a decent summer popcorn flick that lives up to its predecessors. It's definitely ten times better than the second Matrix in all aspects: storyline, special effects, acting. Yes, sure it could have been better; nevertheless T3 is probably the best action movie of this kind since the first Matrix.Arny was good in his role as hi was in the previous two installments. He was born for this role no doubt about it. The only thing that annoyed me was that he was 'programmed' to talk too much. The creators of the movie should've found another way to explain what was happening. Maybe I'm wrong but it just felt a little bit more than was needed. Even the self-parodying lines were too many and not so cool. Moving on to Kristanna Loken (T-X) I'd say she tried her best to fill in the shoes of Robert Patrick who's gonna be remembered forever (whether he likes it or not) with his role in T2 as T-1000. The idea of a sexy terminatrices was a very good indeed, however due to writing limitations the character wasn't explored well enough which brings me to the second problem with this movie. T-X being much more sophisticated and tough to deal with after all was destroyed by our man so much easier than he did T-1000. And what was all this dismantling and screaming at the end. Anyway, I think the best acting came from Claire Danes probably the most convincing one. As I think again Nick Stahl performance was not bad at all. Actually the whole casting was pretty good as were the special effects. The CGI were kept to minimum which was good, very good ... sorry I am having again some flash backs from the CGI in the second Matrix - terrible. Let me get back to T3. I think I can't. I am too upset now.While T3 is not as original and memorable as T1 and T2 classics, it still manages to deliver what is set out to do- a high-budget, cold metal entertainment for the hot summer days. For all the fans of the 'Terminator' franchise and for all those disappointed with the second Matrix and just for all of you out there I recommend this movie. The first group won't be disappointed, the second will be relieved and the third, well I just hope you like it.",Null,0,0,30 July 2003

It won't be in the list of my all time favorite, but nevertheless is quite a memorable flick-mostly plotwise.'Being John Malkovich' in not kind of movie that you see everyday, it is actually in a genre of its own. There are many interesting concepts in this movie-enough for a few more films I guess-but the main one is the idea of: What is like to be somebody else, another person, even for a short time-'15 minutes.' In this case this person is the great John Malkovich. A portal located on the 71/2 floor leads to the head of the actor. The guy who discovers the portal is a puppeteer (John Cusack). How about that for a start. It gets even better. The whole cast in this movie was just perfect, even Charlie Sheen's cameo was cool. Everything was very original and unconventional.For all those of you looking for something more and new in a movie than just the usual revenge, comedy, love, heroes, etc. type of stories I recommend this one.

Nevertheless, one can learn a lot from 'American History X.'This is a movie about the life of two brothers who get involved into a neo-Nazi skinhead gang and the later struggle to set themselves free. Powerful performance, best to date, from Edward Norton and also a very memorable performance from Norton's prison co-worker Guy Torry.

And itfs not because I knew the ending already, it's just it makes no sense, NO SENSE at all. I read most of the reviews on IMDb and a saw only one with similar to my opinion. Most of those that didn't like the movie were because they claim they saw it coming long before the final twist (who is Soze). Well I am not, or I should say I was not one of them.

I don't know what was true from Verbal's story, but at least the part where our crew had to kill that Argentinean guy because he had seen Soze was true-it was confirmed by the police. Are you following me: in order to eliminate the only person who could recognize him, Soze made his persona (picture) available to the whole world. Or maybe he didnft expect that the cop would reveal the truth, quite naive for a 'devil'. And then: why he needed the police to gather them in the first place. He could have just contacted him individually and threaten  them the same way he did later. Actually, why he needed them for; with all his power, money and connections he could have hired a whole army-after all it's not a big deal-just blowing up a small ship it's not about stealing a space shuttle. They weren't even the best crew for the job-there were good thieves, but the job was not about stealing, it was job for Rambo. You got my point?

The Pianist," powerful
","This is going to be a difficult review as difficult and disturbing the movie 'The Pianist' was. Even though our world is saturated with crime and violence I still had close my eyes for some of the scenes in this movie. At one point I thought that it was too much. I have seen many, many movies about the WW2, but a have never seen violence in such a blunt way. One has to be in a lot of pain to be able to make such a movie, which is pretty much the case with Mr. Polanski.The movie tells the true story of a man who survives the holocaust by pure chance, luck, stoicism, and the good will of few good people. Or maybe everything was just a fate. Don't expect to see a hero or fighter kind of story. No, he is just a man fighting for his own survival. This is not a thriller. I knew that there would be a scene where the pianist is supposed to play for a German solder so I was looking forward to seeing it. I wanted to see the direction of the scene, the acting of them both (the pianist and the officer), and of course, hear the music. Well, it was a breathtaking experience. See it for yourself P.S. At the end I think that the Russians a very much in debt to that genre-movies dealing with the WW2. They used to make such a great movies about the war, but not anymore. I think it is about time to see a high budget Russian WW2 movie, a film about those who carried out the entire war on their shoulders.",Null,2,3,29 August 2003

","As I have mentioned before I like movies dealing with the end of the world kind of stories as well as scenes of empty and ravaged cities so I have been looking forward to seeing this one. Now after seeing the movie I have somewhat mixed feelings.It started out great. The shots from the deserted London were astounding. Alex Palmer walking along the cityfs streets, around the parliament, Piccadilly Circus under the sound of this techno was pretty cool. The zombies were also well crafted. In spite of the obvious holes in the story, the first two acts were interesting and enjoyable. Unfortunately, the last (third) half of the film was terrible. The imbecile-turned-Rambo idea was something beyond me. It significantly ruined the good beginning.
Overall, taking into consideration the low budget with which this movie was shot, the great opening scenes and good soundtrack, I think that this movie is worth seeing. 10 for the beginning; overall, 7 stars out of 10.",Null,1,2,30 August 2003
"Good Night, and Good Luck."," too much smoke
","Hallo everybody. It's been quite a while since my last review. It's good to be back.I am going to be brief with this one. I heard a lot about GN&GL and how is one of this year's Oscar contenders so I decided to give it a go. Well, I'd say I'm not fascinated. It is well directed, well paced with a camera work in the spirit of ER and West Wing, and with some incredible cast  a superb performance by David Strathairn, but still didn't quite do it.For people like me who are not familiar with the subject at hand this movie didn't make much sense. It looked like a documentary on the 50's America. Well that's OK but it means nothing to me. It was too historical, too political and too smoked. Can somebody tell me what was with all this chain smoking? There was even a full length KENT commercial shown. Unbelievable. Didn't get the idea. I didn't also understand whether the movie made a stand on the importance of journalism and TV particular in educating the ignorant and helping the weak, or a more general one  the freedom of ideas and beliefs as a whole. I don't know  do I make any sense? I wouldn't recommend this movie to people not familiar with this period of the American history. As to whether the premise of this movie is still relevant, I would say  probably. But I think many people will agree with me that with the rise of the Internet the ways we get access to information have changed for the better. 6 stars out of 10",6,1,9,20 January 2006

I don't think that there is a way to explain in one sentence what this movie is about, but let me try. The closest to 'MD' movie is 'Jacob's Ladder' and to lesser degree 'Vanilla Sky.' What those movies have in common is that all of them depict a dream and like in real dream nothing can be explained, the sequences do not complete each other, the dream just wanders over what it finds fascinating, leaving the unpromising stories and characters behind. It's all about imagination. But if I have to talk about something real that would be about the two women in this movie. Astonishing. Both of them, but I would like to comment on Laura Harring's performance. She was the ultimate outcast in the first part and the classical 'femme fatal' in the second half. I am speechless. And of course nothing would've been complete without Lynch's perfect cinematography.  This movie is definitely in my top 10 list. And again, it isn't about understanding it is about entertainment. This movie entertained me a lot. I love it. 10 stars out of 10.",Null,0,0,13 September 2003
8 Mile," great debut
","Not bad, not bad at all. Eminem does it again. He has it what can I say. The guy runs the show at the moment. I am not a fan don't get me wrong, but I like his recent work and especially the song 'Lose your self.' And the movie is not bad, even thought-provoking.Claiming to be in a way autobiographical, which I don't really believe, this movie is about a guy trying to sober himself from the delirium of his dreams. Eminem is relatively convincing in this role though I think he was too mad throughout ought the whole movie. But I guess it's not easy to 'stop living up there and start living down here.' The only flaw deserving mentioning is that there was not enough music in this movie. Should have been more music, after all that's the main theme of this film.I would even go further by saying that this movie was even inspiring. It taught a very clear message: work hard, really hard, persevere, and you might be able to make it.",Null,0,0,9 August 2003
Jerry Maguire," Hollywood at its highest
","I just finished my forth viewing of the movie and in one thing I disagree with some of the reviewers is that t gets better with every viewing. I think when it comes to 'Jerry Maguire' the best experience you get from the first time, but nevertheless this is one of the sweetest, most adorable movies I've ever seen in my life. Beautiful film.This is movie about transformation, about finding yourself in this 'cynical world' with 'though competitors' in every aspect of our lives. Competition. The survival of the fittest. It's a movie about true values, about friendship or maybe loyalty, money, being able to sleep at night, enjoying what you are doing, it's movie about learning what really matters, it's about being happy. Actually this is a movie about love. I found it. It is about living out onefs life with the one who makes you say: 'I love you. You... complete me'.   The casting was great. Renee Zellweger was the hearth of the movie. This film made her a star but unfortunately there hasn't been much from her ever since. Cuba Gooding Jr. deserves his Oscar for supporting role and Regina King as his wife was perfect. And of course this is Tom Cruise's movie, top to bottom, though I don't think that this is his best performance. My favorite one is in 'Interview with the Vampire'.Cameron Crowe the music critic-turned-director, the creator of this film. That's why the music in each of his movies fits so right. Really looking forward for his next movie after 'Vanilla Sky'. He is the man. I donft think that you can go wrong with this movie. I haven't read a bad review so far. Just sit back and enjoy it. This is what Hollywood is (should be) all about.",Null,1,4,31 July 2003
Toy Story 2," the ultimate toy story
","I watched the first 'Toy Story' because it was listed in the IMDb 250 list and I liked it. Then I felt hesitated to see the second one even tough it was ranked higher that the first one, I thought it canft be better after all it is a sequel and it's an animation. Now little did I know? This one was double the fun. Excellent.  It is a bouquet of fun, action, more fun, adventures, and more fun having even some philosophical scent-Woody's thoughts about life, love, and friendship are very deep and emotional. And surely the biggest contributors to the overall sensation are the voices of Tom Hanks and Tim Allen, especially Hanks.As a child I used to love all Disney, Hanna Barbara, and Warner Bros. cartoons and I guess I still do in a way. 'Toy Story 2' made me recall these forever gone years-with a smile. I don't remember having so much fun watching cartoon in a long time (since my childhood). 10 stars out of 10.",Null,0,1,1 September 2003
The Matrix Reloaded," don't watch this one more than once
","Am I the only one thinking that once becoming filthy rich there are other things that gonna bring you pleasure than just making more money. I guess enough is never enough when it comes to money, but try or at least pretend trying earning this money.  I am referring to Wachowski brothers who are proudly standing newt to George Lucas. I grew up with the first Star Wars trilogy and I really liked the first Matrix, but now I feel, to put it mildly, as I have been taken advantage of. Anyway, it's not something that wont let me sleep at night. Let's stick to the Matrix Reloaded and its beauty.The first thing that comes to my mind is the emotional and devoted play by Keanu Reeves. I don't know how much money he makes for this trilogy, but obviously is not enough. Speaking of him reminds me of somebody's bright idea to turn Reeves into Reeve. Wasn't that cool or what? But let's omit the details. The next big moment was the fight with the Smiths half of which went off under the motto: buy the game `Enter the Matrix'. Another flash on somebody's mind was the idea of putting a human face on one of the most dangerous programs-the Merovingian. Even for such a tough outlasting total of five Neos program nothing can replace a good old human b*** job inside the lady's room. Being such sophisticated one comes at hand: he can program a virtual Viagra for women. Wasn't that cool or what? But how else we are going to make his wife (supposedly similar program) jealous?!?!? which produces on of the best lines in the movie. Wanting to be kissed by Neo in order to sample something forgotten, Persephone gets a Trinity's gun point at her face accompanied by the words: why don't you sample this instead. Great line from a great woman. Speaking of sophisticated programs I wonder who code that English twins to shoot in such a way making the car look like a strainer and yet not even scratching the main target(s). I guess in their haste they must've switched places-the killer got the steering wheel and the driver ended up with the machinegun. I think that's enough. I was thinking to tell you about the powerful speech given by Morpheus and the following techno party in honor of the digging machines. And of course the architect with his divine answers ergo, some of his answers we could understand, and some of them we couldn't. But that's OK, he warned us-we are irrevocably human.My advice is, watch it once. I was stupid enough to see it few times thinking that it will be like the first one Â– better with every viewing. And you could see the result.",Null,0,0,8 July 2003
The Shawshank Redemption," the ultimate prison movie
","What is the only thing nobody can take from us? Faith can be taken, so as love, freedom definitely can be taken away; but there is one think that stays with us till the last breath we take and that is Hope. 'Remember, Red, hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things. And no good thing ever dies.' 'The Shawshank Redemption' is a movie about hope, patience, friendship, and certainly freedom. It is a story of two men trying to survive while doing their time in Shawshank prison. The performance that Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman deliver individually and together is acting at its finest. Especially Freeman. His best performance ever. Actually I am not going to bother revealing the plot or the acting of this one for, I shouldfve started with that, it is a must see gem. It is a 2h 20 min movie but it doesn't stop for a minute to surprise and please.I'll take the liberty to say that I've seen quite a lot of movies in my life so far and learned enough from them to be able to assure on the quality of this masterpiece. Take my word for it.",Null,0,1,21 July 2003
Vanilla Sky," My first movie
","What is a good movie? How do you define which movie is good and which one's bad? Let's elaborate over this matter. I think this issue has three sides.1. The first one has to do with the person himself. His character, mentality, education if you want; in few words: one's background, the way one was brought up and educated - the determinants of one's value system.2. The second one a believe has to do with the current emotional state of the moviegoer at the time of seeing the particular movie. Is he in love or brokenhearted, employed or unemployed, happy or sad; how his day, month, year or last few years were like. Why is he going to see the particular movie: because of the story, actors, director, etc. What is he going to do after the movie? To say: what's in his mind as he enters the movie theatre in terms of current mood, feelings, thoughts.3. The third one surely has to do with the quality of the movie. Even though people have different tastes, there are certain criteria that make the evaluation possible. The most important being-whether we like it or not-the amount of money a movie makes as well as the different movie awards.And the outcome of the above is How does this say 2h fantasy  leave you (fantasy because that what movie making is all about - selling dreams). So How did this dream fit into the three: Was it a good dream something you have experienced and wish you hadn't or it is a completely different kind of dream that you haven't thought about. Is it a dream that you gonna remember for years to come or one that you gonna forget the very next day. And so on and so on.But again How do you define a good movie? I guess there isn't a single answer to that question. It's like life itself: to different people means different things.You may ask: What was the purpose of all this waste of ink so far but that was the question I asked myself after watching the movie 'Vanilla sky' - was it a good movie. Does the fact that I couldn't sleep for days or that I still keep thinking about the whole story after one year already makes a good movie out of it. It is not that I liked or did not like the movie it is just the first movie that hit my threes (background, current condition and movie criteria) with power - for good or bad it will stay with me forever.",Null,0,0,29 June 2003
Trainspotting," I chose to choose it
","If you are young, free, without career, washing machine, dental insurance, electric toothbrush, leisure wear, big f****** TV with tens of channels of s*** to choose from, if you like trance or techno music, British humor, junk food, beer, watching non Hollywood (alternative) movies, ergo you haven't entered the Matrix yet this movie is for you. It is about a guy called Mark 'Rent-boy' Renton played by the flawless and brilliant Ewan McGregor (can't imagine better acting for this role) trying to choose life by fighting his heroin addiction and influence of friends. Nothing special plot wise but very well executed for the budget at Danny Boyle's (director) disposal.For all of you who have already entered the Matrix, starter home, new office, with career, low cholesterol, electric tin-opener, mortgage, designer cloths, BMW, DVD, MD, GMS, GPS, PC, 9 to 5, even CEOs I would say: give it a try, you might like it. After all this is a very good comedy. I donft know why this film is labeled drama in IMDb. To me this one makes as mush a drama as say 'What Dreams May Come' comedy.",Null,1,2,6 September 2003
Amélie," fabulous
","Why is that everybody likes this movie? Let us think about it:The first thing that comes to my mind is the set-Paris-one of the most beautiful cities in the world. The buildings, the streets, the palaces, and everything. It wouldnft have had the same effect if it were shot in any of the cities in the USA. Paris symbolizes love. However, for those of us who have been there we know that that kind of Paris: clean, orderly, safe, simply does not exist. (it reminded me in a way of the small town that Jim Carrey lived in 'The Truman's Show.')The second thing I guess has to do with the cast, to be more precise, the selection of the citizens of Paris. All of them were native French (with the exception of one picture of a black guy). Again for those of us who have had the pleasure to visit the city we know that you get a completely different picture of the city. The third reason has to do with the language. Even though I am not fond of the French language a totally agree with the Merovingian from the second Matrix that in French even when cursing it feels like wiping your a** with silk. Imagine this movie in German or Japanese. And the forth and most important reason is Audrey Tautou. I haven't seen such a big and beautiful eyes in a long time (Ifve been living in Japan for quite sometime now). It wasn't like she threw a great performance it was more like she was born for that role. I hope that she will manage to escape from the 'halo' of this role and avoid the destiny of such actors like Mark Hamill and Carrie Fisher from 'Star Wars' and Tom Hulce from 'Amadeus.'I am surprised that there are not many French movies out there nowadays and I don't know why. I hope to see more of them in the future.",Null,1,4,6 September 2003
Monty Python and the Holy Grail," the ultimate nonsense comedy
","Well, this is unquestionably one of the funniest movies ever made. The first time a saw it I laughed to tears and this is the only time that counts. The first time you get the best experience. I really envy those who haven't seen it yet. From the opening scene to the sudden ending this one won't let you leave the room. Especially the opening scene: 'Are you trying to say that coconuts migrate' or when John Cleese trying to be Tarzan, hanging on the rope said: 'Can somebody give me a push.' An absolute masterpiece.
Considering the low budget that the creators of the movie had at their disposal would probably make 'The Holy Grail' the best movie in this genre-silly nonsense kind of stuff. It shows the great creativity and acting capabilities of the Monty Python crew. It comes to say that a movie can be made with a little bit of money - a great movie. 10 out of 10",Null,266,312,27 August 2003
Gangs of New York," boring
","Scorcese movies have always been an occasion worth celebrating. From the first 'Taxi Driver' till the ultimate best 'Goodfellas' all of his movies were at the very least super entertaining. However, to my modest opinion this is not the case with this one.The first thing that comes to my mind is the length of the movie-super long. Actually, is not that it was long rather that it was filled up with nothing. 'Magnolia' was much longer, but it didn't feel long at all cause it was interesting. The acting, with the exception of Daniel Day-Lewis' one, was weak. Even Diaz who I really appreciate as an actress was very unconvincing. But I don't think this was her fault, it was more of a bad screenplay. With the exception of the opening and closing fights, the rest was even painful to watch. It would've been so much better had it been an hour short.I wouldn't recommend this movie to my friends. I think that there are thousand better ways of spending 166 min of one's life than watching this film. 6 stars out of 10.",Null,1,2,7 September 2003
Donnie Darko," very original, thoughts provoking concoction
","Let me start with this: This is a must see movie. Forget what you have heard or read about Donnie Darko and just go and get the DVD release. The suggested atmosphere is: a dark room (you should let the moon light in though), lying on your bed (preferably alone), leave the usual popcorn or snack in the kitchen this time and get ready to experience something original.I am not gonna tell you that I could dig the whole concept because I couldn't and even if I did, that wouldn't necessarily be the right answer. This is one of those: Vanilla Sky, Mullholland Dr., Lost Highway, Dark City and etc. kind of movies that wont provide you with the answer; it will make you work for it. Yes, this one requires some heavy lifting and that's the beauty of it. There are so many films out there where you can tell the end by just seeing the title or the leading actors. Those are not fun and we all know that. Well this one is different.I would say the plot was toooo complicated. Trying to make something really different and big, Richard Kelly (director and writer) got lost himself and us into the story. He could have simplified the script a bit to mine modest opinion. Because of the great number of different stories and characters throughout the movie the end fell short. It was of course impossible to comprise all the pieces into a 5 min meaningful ending. Kelly should have stick to a bit less of characters and slightly reduce the number of different stories and ideas. Just a bit. Notwithstanding, the whole cast was brilliant, especially the Darko es family. Jake Gyllenhaal (Donnie) delivers a great performance. I canft imagine any better way to play this role. He is the sole of the film. Amazing. Memorable.  Mary Mc Donnell (his mother) was my second best with the greatest line in the movie: asked by her son ghow does it feel like to have a Wacko for a sonh she answers git feels, wonderfulh. Jena Malone (Gretchen) is also perfect for the role. And the whole 80fs sentiment with the soundtrack definitely pulled some strings.And at the end my understanding of the movie is: donft try to explain everything simply because you canft. There are certain things that cannot be explained and are better left such. And when you think, it wonft change a thing even if we could so because not everything has to do with reasoning. Human nature. This is one thing. Second thing has to do with not waiting somebody else to provide you with the right answers. Find your own answer to that movie as well. And I wanted to finish with something about sacrifice and ordinary people but it will be better to leave it unsaid.",Null,2,4,7 July 2003
