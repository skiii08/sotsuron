National Treasure: Book of Secrets," Fair sequel, weaker than the first
","Having just seen this on its opening night, I think I can fairly predict it will be huge. That being said, though, this is a much weaker film than the first one.There's no need for a spoiler warning here: if you've seen the previews, you've already seen pretty much the whole movie; what few surprises there might have been were ruined. Secondly, the characters are a good bit blander this time out. Nicolas Cage's Ben Gates (in the worst haircut since Pete Rose) seems to come up with the answers to the puzzles just a little too easily to draw any drama from the revelations. Diane Kruger is back as Abigail Chase, but romantic troubles between her and Gates, introduced for no real reason, are as easily forgotten later. Ed Harris, although a fine actor, has a plain-vanilla role here as the bad guy whose motivations seem as unclear to himself as to the audience. Jon Voight reprises and enlarges his role as the father, and is joined (for no particular reason) by Helen Mirren as the mother, but neither really seems necessary to the movie. Harvey Keitel's role as FBI agent Sadusky might have been nicely enlarged into a second threat to Gates, but is instead reduced to almost nothing. And Justin Bartha is back (and great) as sidekick Riley, but the subplot of his IRS problems (and a running joke of his being mistaken for Gates) just don't work.As for the suspension of disbelief, a little too much is asked, as brilliant insights come too quickly, gigantic stones are way too light, and the Secret Service (not to mention the Queen's palace guards) just a bit too easy to fool. If a movie is going to ask you to overlook a lot, there has to be a bigger payoff.Several reviews have pointed out the similarity of this series to the Indiana Jones films; let's hope that like those, the third National Treasure movie (strongly hinted at the end) will make a strong comeback after this so-so sequel. -----------------------P.S. - Kudos to the nameless Disney executive who decided to bring back the idea of the pre-movie cartoon (and Goofy is always a great choice), but with 40 years to think about it, this short was the best you could come up with?",5,0,1,21 December 2007
3:10 to Yuma," Just OK
","Although beautifully filmed, and with capable performances by Christian Bale and Russel Crowe (I agree with the reviewer who compared Bale to Gregory Peck), this movie just doesn't live up to its hype.I'm willing to overlook a few plot holes and unexpected twists; after all, a story with no surprises is no story, just information. But there's a certain level of credibility beyond which I can't go. You want to have a character survive being shot? Fine, but don't gut-shoot grizzled old Peter Fonda and then have him riding a horse the next day (on what even the characters described as a 'hard ride'.) Don't have the group reluctantly decide that they must try to sneak through Indian territory, but then build a roaring fire that reveals their position.I'll even go along with the murderer's being unwilling to kill a protagonist he has come to grudgingly admire, but just because the guards on the prison train were nice enough to let him get off for a minute to say 'hi' to his gang, I can't believe he would then GET BACK ON (even if Trigger the Wonder Horse is just waiting for a whistle to come follow.) For that matter, what was there for Crowe to find so admirable in Bale's character? How hard is it to guard a prisoner who will gladly follow you in running and jumping across rooftops, to catch a train that will take him to be hanged? Maybe he just wanted to be there to help out in case Bale's character remembered he has a wooden leg and shouldn't be able to run or jump across rooftops.By the way, note to Ben Foster, who played the evil-but-loyal sidekick Charlie Prince: tone it down a notch. Every time he came on the screen, I felt like I was watching Mark Rolston's 'bull queer' character from 'Shawshank Redemption'. It's a shame that in a movie where the director was trying so desperately to make everyone 'multifaceted' (to the point of unbelievability) that Prince would come off as so unremittingly evil in EVERY scene in which he appeared.I can't believe that people are comparing this mediocrity to the great old westerns, or to great modern ones ('Unforgiven', for example.) Maybe they're so hungry for the genre that anything with a guy on a horse looks good. After all, this is the finest western to come from a major studio in years. It's just a shame that that doesn't say very much.",4,9,18,27 September 2007
X-Men Origins: Wolverine," Better than I expected
","Disclosure: I am not an X-Men aficionado. I like the movies, but I do not follow the comics or other sources of canonical 'lore,' so I don't have any preconceived notions about how a story should be treated. But I have enjoyed the movies (OK, not so much the third, but as a matter of film-making, not because I necessarily considered it blasphemy against something I hold dear.) That said, I found this to be a fairly entertaining look at the origin of the most famous of the X-Men, Wolverine. The plot was a little thin, but did have enough sudden turns to hold your interest. Some nice set pieces showing him and his brother (well-played by Liev Schreiber) in various wars could have been a bit longer than the few seconds each got, but were adequate to demonstrate the growing tension between the two brothers as they matured over the course of 200 years. The long-awaited scene where he gets his adamantium skeleton was nicely done, but would have benefited from being a bit darker and more graphic.The other mutants were a bit pointless, and at some points even comical (who'd have thought there would be a crossover to 'Fat Bastard' of Austin Powers fame?) And the role of Gambit was completely pointless, unless he is, as I suspect, a larger character in the comic arena, and had been demanded by X-Men fans who missed him in the other three movies. But his character did nothing helpful that anyone else couldn't have done. Cyclops seemed to be there as nothing more than foreshadowing that he's getting the next 'origin' movie.If the movie had one weakness that stands out, it would be the CGI. Guys, we're a couple decades into this now; there's no excuse for the blades not looking real. It's silly to have cartoonish-looking blades, especially in the shots where they weren't seen protruding from Logan's hands, and real metal could have been used (the farmhouse bathroom, for example.) Another example of poor effects was Patrick Stewart's uncredited cameo as Dr. Xavier. Although I imagine people are more difficult than metal, his face was so airbrushed to make it younger (even worse than in X-3) that I really do not know if it was all CGI, or just a live shot with bad retouching work. No Oscar for you, guys! All in all, though, 'X-Men Origins: Wolverine' will be an adequate beginning to the summer blockbuster popcorn movie season, and will do well enough until 'Star Trek' launches next week.",7,18,33,2 May 2009
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," Wait for the DVD
","I must admit I enjoyed the first movie of the 'Pirates of the Caribbean' trilogy (although anyone who considered it the best pirate movie ever simply hasn't seen enough movies.) And I suppose it was inevitable that there would be sequels, given how much cash Disney managed to rake in on it.But take all of the complaints that you might have had about last year's 'Dead Man's Chest' (too long, tedious and pretentious, needlessly-complex plot) and double them for 'At World's End.' Have these people never heard of an editor? Or could it be that no one at the studio has the nerve to tell Gore Verbinkski to back off a bit? For heaven's sake, the movie is three hours long! You're telling me that nothing could have been trimmed? Example: the interminable 'limbo' scene with the humorous-but-overrated Johnny Depp mincing around the Bonneville Salt Flats; after seeing this worthless scene, which advances the story not a whit, I cannot fathom what scenes will appear on the 'deleted scenes' section of the DVD release. Similarly, the final battle, while visually impressive, seems to take forever to reach a conclusion.As in 'Dead Man's Chest', a relatively simple story would have been preferable to the ridiculously complex mishmash presented here. Eventually, you just don't care who's on which side, because you know it's subject to change at a moment's notice. Betrayal by a leading figure should come as a shock to both the other characters and to the audience, but after a few hours of it happening repeatedly, there are no longer discernible sides to the conflict, but just a squabbling rabble.Verbinski also insisted on unnecessary 'growth' in characters both major and minor. Although Depp's Jack Sparrow is toned down a trifle, Orlando Bloom is much darker this time out, and seems to have little motivation other than being generally annoyed at the world. Keira Knightley, while always nice to look at, is even more laughable as an action heroine (and King of the Pirates, believe it or not) than as an actress. A contrived romantic history between Calypso the bayou gypsy and Bill Nighy's Davy Jones provides him with unneeded motivation (since when must mythical bad guys have more reason than just being bad guys?) Mackenzie Crook and Lee Arenberg, who were likable as comic-relief pirate bumblers Pintel and Ragetti, are expanded to the point that their comic duties must be taken over by a pair of British soldiers. For Pete's sake, even the darn monkey and parrot get extra screen time! (It's almost reminiscent of the 'Lethal Weapon' series, which with every new outing seemed to pick up a new character, like a ship picking up barnacles.) On the other hand, Governor Swann (enjoyably played by character actor Jonathan Pryce) is killed, off camera, for no discernible reason.A couple of nice additions: Chow Yun Fat playing the pirate lord of Singapore, and Rolling Stone Keith Richards as Jack Sparrow's dad (although the latter casting was an obvious economy measure, as Richards was able to supply his own clothes and makeup.) The cinematography and Hans Zimmer's score leave no room for complaint, except that there is about an hour too much of each.One last nit-pick. At the end, when the Black Pearl and Flying Dutchmen are each poised to fire a broadside into Beckett's flagship, we're treated to the implausible scene of Beckett unable to come up with an order in response. Hmmm, let's see: his ship has a couple hundred cannons run out and ready to go.. how about 'Fire!'? Alas, that might have made the movie go on even longer, so he unbelievably remains silent as his ship is destroyed. The scene smacks of a belated decision to 'let's-just-get-it-over-with.' I suspect that the main problem with this film is that Verbinski was hired to make a nice, fun little popcorn-muncher of a summer movie, but somewhere along the way he started to believe he was making an epic. Unfortunately, there's just not enough here to float that boat. Remember, all this is based on a 40-year-old amusement-park ride.It would be nice someday to see this a version of this movie (ditto 'Dead Man's Chest') that's drastically tightened up, with an hour or so left on the cutting-room floor. There's a really fine movie in there somewhere, amidst all the flotsam and jetsam. For now, wait for the DVD, and use the fast-forward.",3,1,3,29 May 2007
Hellboy II: The Golden Army," No no no, wrong wrong wrong, bad bad movie!
","Imagine if all of Star Wars had been Jar Jar Binks. Think about the annoying kid 'Short Round' from the second Indiana Jones movie. Remember for a second how cheated you felt after paying to sit through 'Men in Black II,' 'Aliens III,' and 'Star Trek V'. You get the idea.This movie took a good gritty graphic novel (and pretty good first film) and screwed it up to appeal to the kiddie market. Instead of the tough but lovable demon we met in the first film, 'Hellboy II' makes him more of a buffoonish cartoon character. Aside from a scene of gratuitous Tecate beer drinking (with the name on the can ALWAYS facing the camera, of course) and one 'I'm gonna kick his ass' comment, I'm hard pressed to see how this received even a PG-13 rating. It's a bad sign when the high point of an action movie is (I kid you not) a Barry Manilow song. Let me repeat that: A BARRY MANILOW SONG.Selma Blair is excellent in her return as Liz Sherman, but Ron Perlman is toned down way too much this time. Gone is the cynical, grumbling behemoth of the first movie, only to be replaced by a red version of Sully from 'Monsters Inc.' His love of cats, rather than being an amusing anachronism, now seems quite in character for what he has become, a p***y-whipped homebody, promising to try to clean up his act. The underlying threat is just no longer there.The other characters fared no better. Sadly, the talented David Hyde Pearse, who in the original (unbilled) voiced Abe Sapien, has been replaced in the role by a C3P0 clone Doug Jones (who wore the blue tadpole suit in both films.) The always-tedious Jeffrey Tambor, freshly unemployed from the mercifully-canceled 'Welcome to the Captain', was in WAY too many scenes playing, essentially, Jeffrey Tambor. Worst of all: Seth MacFarlane, who voices Peter Griffin on 'Family Guy', turns in a ridiculously bad performance providing the voice of a faceless new German agent, Johann Krauss; honestly, the accent and inflections were so cringe-inducing, they would be questionable in a Scooby-Doo cartoon, never mind a major motion picture.This could have been a good movie. The plot (an elf prince seeks to revive an indestructible golden army to renew an ancient war with humanity) was promising, and Luke Goss and Anna Walton (as the prince and his sister) both did good jobs with the roles (although their makeup was shamelessly copied from that of the Wraith aliens of 'Stargate: Atlantis', and it would have been nice to see a few more elves other than just the two of them and their father.) But execution is important too, and to be taken seriously, a movie needs to take itself at least somewhat seriously. This one didn't. With foolish performances, silly voices and sound effects, dumb stunt sequences (the baby-tossing scene seen in previews), and a cutesy dime-store soundtrack, 'Hellboy II' never lets the audience believe that there's any real menace presented in the story.Particularly if you liked the original graphic novel or the first 'Hellboy' movie, you're going to be annoyed by this watered-down, Disney-esque sequel. Never mind the shameless foreshadowing of the plot of 'Hellboy III', they never should have made 'Hellboy II' if they weren't going to do a better job than this.",3,15,32,11 July 2008
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," JJ has done to Star Wars what he did to StarTrek
","My title pretty much says it all. The same simpletons who loved what JJ Abrams did with his lobotomized 'reboot' of the Star Trek universe are similarly enthralled with the Abrams-led final Star Wars trilogy. Strip-mining the work of better and more original filmmakers who came before, this movie (like it's two predecessors) is a high-action low-intellect shadow of what once was.None of the gee-whiz magic that informed the original SW trilogy is left in its cinematic universe, mercilessly wrung out in a higher effort to get uncritical butts in the seats and maximize the toy sales.I can only conclude that Lucas's original masterpiece has sadly fallen into the hands of those who never understood it in the first place, targeted to consumers either too ignorant or apathetic to know the difference, and cashed in on by an original visionary who no longer gives a damn.If you like these final three movies, I have nothing but pity and contempt for you.",3,27,37,26 February 2020
"I, Robot"," Not sure it could have been good
","As one of the 'Loved It, 10 / 10' reviewers said, if you love Isaac Asimov's work, you probably won't like this film. He's right: I do and I didn't.I must admit that the chase sequences were exciting, and the robots themselves (especially the facial features) quite compelling. Will Smith turns in a capable performance, given the script. But the story could have been so much more.After dozens of robot stories, Asimov's three laws of robotics were a deeply ingrained paradigm of his 'universe', and their inviolability was the framework on which many of his plots were built. The idea that there could be an overlying law that superseded them (as explored in the last of his 'Robot novels') was meant to be a profound one.This is hinted at in Dr. Calvin's disbelief, even ridicule, of the possibility that a robot had caused the death of Dr. Lanning, and Detective Spooner's superiors are similarly skeptical of his theory. But the average viewer of the movie would have no such bias. The three laws were mentioned only in passing, while Spooner's distrust of robots (although effectively explained later) was evident from the start. There's no reason for the audience to favor one over the other. There could be no surprise for the viewer when it was revealed how a robot had done the unthinkable, because for them there was no reason to believe it WAS unthinkable. This might have been, like many of Asimov's stories, a taut little mystery disguised as a sci-fi yarn. Done correctly, it could have been a nice variation on the man-murdered-in-a-locked-room scenario, if the audience could be made to believe that the addition of a robot was irrelevant. As it is, there was no question to be resolved, just Spooner trying to stay alive long enough to make everyone else believe in Sonny's guilt. 'Spooner thought all along a robot was guilty, and turns out he was right, well good for him.' Along the way, some nice effects and car chases, but very little else.I'm not sure it would have been possible to make this film in such a way that viewers unfamiliar with Asimov's work would appreciate it, yet be more true to the tone of his stories. It may be that there's just no way to instill in that audience (at least at first) a sense of mystery that should have accompanied the crime scene. Perhaps if Smith's character had also believed that a homicidal robot was impossible, and only reluctantly been brought to believe otherwise, the audience could have been surprised too.",3,2,4,29 August 2007
Stardust," Go see something better (or worse!)
","As has been said repeatedly in these reviews, this is a pale copy of 'Princess Bride', with the emphasis on pale. Everything in this movie (acting, story, direction, score) is bland and tasteless. The protagonist Tristan is not so much a hero as just the guy in the center of the lens, wandering around with a dumb look on his face. Claire Danes, too, sleep-walks her way through every scene. Michelle Pfeiffer and Robert DeNiro easily outshine everyone else anytime they're on screen (never together, sadly) but the script they've been given is so weak that it's just sad to watch actors of their talent trying to make something of it. It's literally pitiful to see. (Pfeiffer's been AWOL for quite a while, but does DeNiro really need a paycheck so badly? Can we pass a hat for him?)One of the too-few bright spots: the somewhat Python-esquire banter between the ghosts of the murdered princes as they observe the goings-on like spectators at a ballgame.This film is not BAD, per se; if it had been just a bit worse it might have been enjoyable as a laughably bad movie, but I couldn't even work up interest enough to hate anything about it. It's just so... MEDIOCRE. Imagine a bowl of unsweetened oatmeal. Lukewarm. With a glass of tapwater. I've not read the graphic novel source material for this film, but I can't imagine that it was as mediocre as the resulting movie; no one would have been inspired to turn it into a motion picture. If you must waste two hours on this, at least wait for its second run in the dollar theaters. In a few months, you won't remember ever having seen it.-----------------My prediction proved true. Now in 2010, I had to read my OWN review twice to recall this movie at all, and even at that, my clearest memory is of an afternoon wasted.",3,11,32,22 August 2007
Pride & Prejudice," Who knew? Keira Knightley can actually act!
","I stumbled onto this adaptation of the famous novel on TV, only a few weeks after having viewed the Greer Garson / Lawrence Olivier version. I admit I honestly was not prepared to enjoy it much. After seeing Keira Knightley's - ahem - 'acting' in the various 'Pirates of the Caribbean' films, I expected something along the lines of Demi Moore's 'Scarlett Letter'. To my great surprise, she was quite good! This movie definitely has a more modern feel than the 1940 version, which is to be expected. But with much of the formality stripped away, the emotions are better revealed. Knightley gives a very fine performance as the proud girl whose head will not be so easily turned, and refuses to let her family be trifled with; her anger and resentment when she learns of Darcy's interference with Jane's romance (and in rudely rebuffing his proposal) is much more genuine than that of Garson's Lizzie. Matthew Macfadyen also does well, playing Darcy not as Olivier's arrogant fop, but as a young man who wishes to do the right thing, but sometimes seems constrained almost to the point of stuttering by his shyness.Smaller roles were also well cast: the somewhat surprising choice of Donald Sutherland as Mr. Bennet was a pleasure in his every scene, and Brenda Blethyn as his well-intentioned but frivolous wife was almost as much fun as 1940's Mary Boland. Rosamund Pike practically emanated goodness as the gentle Jane, while Judy Dench commanded her every scene as the blood-chilling Lady Catherine, who would not easily allow her stratum of society to be polluted by the upstart Bennet family. (That was the kind of role trademarked by Edna May Oliver, though, and I still prefer her, even if she did allow some sliver of goodness to peek through.) I have not seen the oft-cited BBC adaptation of 'Pride and Prejudice', but I can attest that this 2005 version was also an excellent production. It is quite accessible to modern audiences, and has been made so without the common error of 'dumbing down' the story or characters for modern tastes. It's nice to see that enjoyable period movies from classic literature can still be made without tossing in a rock ballad or changing the setting to modern Los Angeles, just to please the kiddies.Rent this one and get your teenage daughter to watch it (it'll be easier if you mention Keira Knightley stars.) Who knows, you just may open a whole new world to her.",8,7,13,27 May 2008
Joker," I don't give ten-star ratings
","There's a reason you use the weighted average on IMDb's ratings. There are a helluva lot of people out there who, if they like a movie, give it ten stars, but if they don't care for it, give it one. They have no gray area, no ability to recognize that most movies are somewhere in between. Thus, the weighted average, which tosses out the tens and ones, and gives you the rating of people who THINK.I don't give out ten-star ratings. I don't do the obligatory standing ovations that seem to follow every damn live performance, and I don't yell 'bravo' unless it's actually called for. But I'm giving 'Joker' ten stars.It's rare that I see people sitting in their seats just staring at the credits after the lights to come up, not because they're waiting for some stinger scene, but because they're just too stunned to move. 'Joker' did that to the audience with which I saw it. The most common comment I heard in the lobby afterward? 'Holy shit.'This movie is a high dive into the deep end of the crazy pool. Fifteen minutes in, I was convinced that it will be at least a nominee for Best Picture, and for my money, the clear winner. If Joaquin Phoenix does not come away with the Best Actor Oscar, it's only because the Academy winners decide that it doesn't count as acting if you're actually crazy, because NOBODY is that good of an actor. Even the score was Oscar-worthy, moody and threatening.Yes, this is the Joker of the Batman universe. It touches on some of the familiar Batman tropes: young Bruce Wayne, Gotham City, Arkham Asylum. But make no mistake, this is not a comic book movie. This is a fascinating and and powerful and disturbing look at the decline into madness of a troubled person, pushed by events over the edge of the mental chasm. SEE IT.THIS was a ten-star movie. Bravo!",10,1,3,4 October 2019
Blade Runner," Overrated 'meh' festival
","Boring and pretentious, the original 'Blade Runner' is an overlong slog that was just isn't worth the trip. There's a reason this movie bombed when it was released in 1982, and no amount of fanboy revionist history can overcome its basic flaws.Yes, the dystopian vision of the future was groundbreaking some 35 years ago, but now we've seen it over and over again, and usually done better; you can give Ridley Scott an A- for originality since he got there early, but only a C for execution. The synthesizer soundtrack may have sounded futuristic and innovative at the time (though it was likely more of a concession to budgetary realities than an artistic choice) but now it's just a bit grating. Similarly, he visual effects were not even cutting edge at the time (compare them to 'Star Wars' and 'Star Trek: The Motion Picture,' made five and three years earlier, respectively: both look much better.) Harrison Ford, who can turn in a fine performance when he wants to, just phoned this one in, and seems as bored as the audience for most of the film, especially during his monotone narration; Sean Young (though quite decorative) was similarly wooden. The dialog is stilted, the pacing stodgy, the story overstuffed, and the editing insufficient.'Blade Runner' can be most appreciated for its contribution to the 'feel' of many later films. But on its own merits, it's mediocre at best.",5,2,5,8 October 2017
Incredibles 2," Remember how you felt after 'Independence Day 2'?
","2016. After a twenty-year gap, a sequel to the original 'Independence Day' is finally released. Audiences flock to see 'Independence Day: Resurgence,' only to leave asking '20 years, and THIS is the best they could do?' 'Incredibles 2' was NOT as bad as that, but it tried. You'd think with 14 years to work on it, they could have come up with better than this. Director Brad Bird always said he wouldn't make a sequel to his brilliant original 'Incredibles' until the right script could be developed. Don't think that the release of this film means it did; he just decided not to wait any longer.A tired rehash of the original movie, albeit with new Jack-Jack antics and poop jokes thrown in, 'Incredibles 2' indulges in the already-worn-out-its-welcome Hollywood trope of 'Let's do the same thing , but this time with a WOMAN!' It didn't work for 'Ocean's 8,' it didn't work for 'Estrogen Ghostbusters,' and it didn't work here. There's nothing wrong with putting Elastigirl in the action, but if her character is not developed in the process (while simultaneously diminishing the character of Mr. Incredible) then it's just a pointless indulgence.Combine that with an oversupply of subplots muddying things, and you end up with a movie that sorely lacks its predecessor's inventiveness and heart, or even its fast-paced storyline.Nevertheless, this movie will make tons of money, from kids who will be attracted to the flashy action sequences (but who WILL likely squirm and whine during some excessively-long pillow talk between Bob and Helen) and the adults who liked the first one and go to see this sequel out of nostalgia. Inevitably, there will be a third in the franchise, though likely WITHOUT Bird at the helm, and even more likely without the 14-year gap. Let's hope it is more like the original.",6,0,3,22 June 2018
