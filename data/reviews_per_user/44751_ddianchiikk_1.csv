Walk the Line," Best of the best!
","Walk the Line is a fantastic success. The main film of the year 2005 is « Walk the Line » by the producer James Mangold.
The movie is not only about the life of Johnny Cash, it's about the love in his life.
 
Walk the Line tells about the life of the singer who had to move past the ravages of addiction, the temptations of stardom and other difficulties , in order to become a legendary person.The script here is simply remarkable, every scene was true to life. This movie is also unpredictable , there wasn't a moment where I thought I could predict what anyone was going to say or do next. 
It is a beautiful love story of two people who support and defend one another, despite all the obstacles on their way.
The lovers are here played by Joaquin Phoenix and Reese WitherspoonJoaquin Phoenix is very charismatic actor, that's perfect for the elusive Cash, a quiet figure with a piercing gaze and a deep voice. She's just incredibly charming and feminine. Their transformation is astounding. 'Walk the Line' follows the story line of many other musical biopics, maybe because many careers are the same: Hard times, obscurity, success, stardom, too much money, romantic adventures, drugs or booze, and then love and reaching a more lasting stardom. This story of Johnny Cash's career was well done. It is well known that Phoenix and Witherspoon perform their own vocals in the movie. Their outstanding performances help make it the strongest country-music film in years , their the songs are so perfect.Walk the Line is as good an explanation about role as a musician and star. By showing his flaws as well as his strengths, the film becomes a stirring example of a peculiarly success story, as well as a vivid reminder of the price of fame. The movie shows the bad consequences of bad behavior and the good consequences of good behavior. That it's all true made it even more touching. It is really an inspiring film!
The story line, acting and directing were all excellent.The film is about his search for happiness. This is a special film, more than a biographic it's an emotional masterpiece and one of the best movies for me.
Highly recommend!",10,1,1,22 April 2018
