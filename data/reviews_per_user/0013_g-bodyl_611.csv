The Rock," Wonderful Action Film!
","The Rock is one of the best action films of the 90's. I was surprised that I never heard of it until recently being the movie buff I am and with the big name director, composer, producer, and actors. I think Michael Bay is a pretty good director despite what everyone else says.This is about a ruthless general who captures the Alcatraz prison and is bent on taking San Francisco hostage unless he's paid the money he wants because he feels the American government did not recognize his fallen soldiers.The acting is very good here. Sean Connery still has some great action moves in his old age. Nic Cage is a great actor despite what everyone else said. Of course, I loved Ed Harris. He is one of the best.Unlike most action movies, this movie has great character development. The plot has been seen before but the creators brought the plot to a whole new level. The score by Hans Zimmer is a magnificent piece.Overall, this is an excellent action movie. I wanna see more of these action films. I rate this film 10/10.",10,1,2,4 November 2010
The King's Speech," Great Film But is it a True Oscar Winner?
","No doubt about it, The King's Speech is a great film that features a talented British cast and often does a good job at keeping the attention of the audience. I never thought that I would like this film as much as I did, but I was pleasantly surprised. I think Tom Hooper made a name for himself with this movie.This film is a historical film based off King George the Sixth and his famous speech problems. This film has George meeting his speech therapist and reluctantly agrees to do the therapist's programs. After his brother abdicates the throne, George may need his therapist more than ever.Colin Firth delivers a excellent performance. This portrayal may be his best ever in his career. He truly excelled as King George. It's as if he transformed into George. The supporting cast led by Geoffrey Rush and Helena Bonham Carter were splendid. This film is one that can be used to teach people on what acting looks like when done properly.Overall, this is a great film with lots of promise. It has a few dull moments here or there. The main question is: does this film deserves Best Picture? Honestly, I don't think so. I thought The Social Network or The Fighter should have won. But, nonetheless I was really happy about how great this film turned out to be. I rate this film 8/10.",8,1,2,16 January 2013
Despicable Me 2," First Film Was Just A Little Better.....
","Despicable Me 2, the sequel to the 2010 smash hit, is an entertaining film and quite funny at times. It's not as good as the first film as it lacks the creative dialog the first film possessed. That being said, the Minions were funny and adorable as usual, the animation was crisp, the characters were worth getting to know, but it lacks the fresh feel of the original. Kids will adore this film and even most adults would like it somewhat. If you're a fan of the first film, you may come to enjoy the sequel.This film marks the return of Gru. But this time, Gru is not a villain as he is trying to work on his parenting skills. But he gets recruited by the Anti-Villain League to go undercover and find out which person stole a secret Antarctic lab. Along the way, he gets help from Lucy, the awkward agent from the League.This film has a respectable voice cast. Steve Carell returns as Gru and does an effective job. Russell Brand and Miranda Cosgrove also return and they did a good job. Kristen Wiig is a good addition to the cast and I think she's perfect for Lucy, instead of Ms. Hattie. I wanted to see Al Pacino voice the villain, but I think Benjamin Bratt did a fair enough job.Overall, Despicable Me 2 does not feel as fresh as the first film, but it still makes for a high-quality piece of entertainment. The visuals are excellent and this movie makes good use for the music. The story seems a little stale, but then isn't that the case for many sequels? But I had a fun time and I'm sure many children did too. I rate this film 8/10.",8,0,0,13 October 2014
The Mask," Fun to Watch!
","1994 has been a kind year for Jim Carrey. That year is what gave him his long, stellar career. He starred in Ace Ventura:Pet Detective, Dumb and Dumber, and now the Mask. I thought this movie is the best out of the three. I really enjoyed this movie a lot.This is about a guy named Stanley Ipkiss who is a bad luck guy. He finds an ancient, Viking mask that has special powers. When he puts the mask on, he becomes a fun character.I think that this movie proved that Carrey can do just more than comedy. He can also do drama. He was very fun to watch. This is also Cameron Diaz's first movie. She is very good looking in this movie.Overall, I had a fun time watching this. It's a nice movie to watch over and over. I rate this film 8/10.",8,0,0,6 July 2011
The Benchwarmers," Very Funny!
","I thought this movie was absolutely hilarious. This has to be one of the best comedies of 2006. The basic plot line revolves around three nerds who wants to play baseball. They team up with a rich manager and his son is a nerd. The three nerds played by Rob Schneider, David Spade, and Jon Heder make up their own team and they play other teams. But, the teams are not nerds and they have a 9-man lineup. Will the make the championships? First of all, I have to say that the nerds were funny because they acted like nerds. I like Nick Swardson and his thing with sunlight. I was also surprised that Reggie Jackson made an appearance. I am a big Yankees fan, so I was happy that Jackson was in the movie. Everything worked well with the film. Adam Sandler, make a sequel for this film! I rate this movie a 9/10.",9,2,3,8 December 2007
Moneyball," Deserves The Praise!
","Moneyball is definitely worth all the praise it has been receiving. This is not a baseball film per se but more of a drama that centrals around the Oakland Athletic's General Manager, Billy Beane. This film features great acting, solid direction by Bennett Miller, a well-written screenplay, and a new take on the baseball films which have been done so many times before. Of course there are baseball scenes, but for once we get a look at the realistic portrayal of what happens behind the scenes.This film, based off the autobiography by Billy Beane himself, is about his 2002 season. After three superstars leave his team to get more money elsewhere, he designs a way to get players based off stats. With everyone calling him crazy including the A's manager, will this stat plan be effective? Brad Pitt is a very good, versatile actor. He certainly displays acting chops and I believed he should have won Best Actor at the Oscars. Jonah Hill takes a turn for the dramatic and perhaps has the best performance of his young career. And of course, Philip Seymour Hoffman is great as always.Overall, Moneyball has to be one of the greatest baseball films I have seen thanks to the way they filmed it. If they are to make sports films in the future, this is how to do it. It takes away all those clichés we see over and over again. It's good that this film was recognized by the Academy. I rate this film 9/10.",9,2,3,19 April 2013
The Avengers," Amazing!
","Marvel's the Avengers is nothing short of an amazing movie. If there's anything I can say, it's that it is the best superhero movie I have seen. Not only does it have the impressive set pieces and enough action to last you a lifetime, it has an emotional core and you actually get to care about each and every single character despite the big cast. It's good that we get to see our favorite heroes Iron Man, Thor, Captain America, and Hulk all join forces to defeat evil. Amazing indeed! Joss Whedon's film is about how our favorite heroes form an alliance called S.H.I.E.L.D and their mission is to stop Loki, Thor's half-brother from destroying New York City and the rest of the world.This film boasts an impressive cast indeed. Robert Downey Jr is here and witty as usual. Chris Evans as Capt. America is great and a good leader. Chris Hemsworth as Thor is very good. Mark Ruffalo as the Hulk was an interesting casting choice but it works out. Tom Hiddleston as Thor is a slimy, sarcastic guy but he makes a great villain. On a side note, one of my favorite scenes involves a confrontation between Loki and Hulk.Overall, this is one amazing superhero movie! It's funny, action-packed, and emotional. The final 45 minutes is just great with all the action scenes. This movie is essentially Transformers but with a better story. This movie has me waiting for the sequel and subsequent spin-offs. A word to DC fans who hate this film just because it's from Marvel: It's a great film(just like the Batman films.) This is one impressive, action-packed, visually-thrilling, and emotion-provoking film. I rate this film 10/10.",10,1,4,16 December 2013
National Treasure: Book of Secrets," Better Sequel!
","National Treasure 2 is just as good as I anticipated it to be. In fact, it might even be a little better. This movie is similar to the first film, but almost 100 years later in history.The story focuses on Abraham Lincoln and Thomas Gates. It turns out that Gates might have been involved in the assassination of President Lincoln. Now, it's up to Ben Gates and crew to clear the family name. To do that, they have to kidnap the President.The acting is very good. The cast is full of A-actors such as Nicholas Cage, Ed Harris, Helen Mirren, and Jon Voight. The suspense and the action is big-time good. I liked the music in this film. There is nothing negative to say about this film. There are great scenes of the Buckingham Palace and Mount Rushmore.Overall, this is a fun-filled family adventure. I recommend this movie to anyone. I rate this movie 10/10.",10,0,1,23 January 2009
Million Dollar Arm," A Culture Clash!
","Another year, another attempt from the studios to bring out a feel-good sports film. In 2014, they have succeeded with, 'Million Dollar Arm,' a movie based off factual accounts. I really liked this movie for a variety of reasons. I am always fascinated by Indian culture, and the movie shows the Bollywood culture to a true extent. Baseball is my favorite sport, and just seeing people learning to play the game is pure delight. The film itself is provoking, as well as intelligent, funny, and just a well-crafted movie despite its predictable outcome. Craig Gillepsie's film is about a sports agent who is down on his luck and is losing money fast. His final play involves starting a program to teach Indian cricket players baseball so they can be scouted by MLB. But J.B Bernstein finds out it is a lot harder than he thought as these Indian players must get used to a foreign sport and an alien culture. Jon Hamm does a great job in the lead role as J.B. Sure, his character is self-centered, but Hamm plays him well. Lake Bell had a few great scenes as a possible romantic interest of J.B. Alan Arkin cracked me up as the grumpy elderly scout. I also liked Suraj Sharma who know delivers back-to-back Hollywood performances with this film and 'Life of Pi.' Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed Million Dollar Arm. It's a fun, clever sports movie that has a typical Disney 'feel-good' tone to it. I also liked the culture clash that is presented in the movie between the Indian and American cultures. The film presents an unique opportunity to learn about Indian culture and I appreciated that. A funny, entertaining sports movie. My Grade: A-",9,3,3,15 April 2015
Angels & Demons," It Differs Somewhat From Novel, But It's Still Great!
","I did not know what to expect when I first saw this movie. I liked the Da Vinci Code which was close to the book. I read the book, Angels and Demons many times that I know the book word by word. I was first disappointed that the book and movie differ so much, then I realized that I liked the movie because of the intense scenes. Big fans of Dan Brown's novels will be disappointed.Tom Hanks returns as the leading symbologist, Robert Langdon. Langdon is called to Vatican City to help the Swiss Guard uncover antimatter from the grounds beneath and to stop some evil dude from killing and branding four cardinals.The acting and directing are pretty good. I always liked Tom Hanks and Ron Howard so their great performances were no surprise. I was pleasantly surprised at Ewan McGregor. The only movies I liked him in was Black Hawk Down and Star Wars.This movie has plenty of action and intense scenes. These won't disappoint big fans of action. I liked the score of Hans Zimmer especially the solo violin solos. Overall, this was a great movie though not accurate to the book. I rate this movie 9/10.",9,0,0,29 November 2009
Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Another Taratino Masterpiece!
","Quentin Taratino is a very good director even though he is is not like most mainstream directors. I liked every single film of his including the second half in the Kill Bill series. This movie toned down the action, but the dialogue was incredible.Uma Thurman returns as 'The Bride' and she continues on her mission to find and kill the rest of the assassins who almost killed her.The acting is really good. Uma Thurman really fits in well with her character. But, I really liked Daryl Hannah as Elle. I would not want to cross her or her black mamba.Overall, this is a great movie to watch. It's not as good as the first Kill Bill but it's still excellent. I rate this movie 9/10.",9,3,6,30 December 2011
Vertigo," Keeps You In Suspense!
","Vertigo is the first Alfred Hitchcock film I have experienced and that is one of the many reasons why the film will stick to my heart forever. I was surprised how this film received mixed reviews when originally released, but I guess the contemporary audience was not ready for him just yet. This film fits the definition of a mystery, but it is much deeper than that. It's a love story, and a painful one to boot. The love expressed here is desirable, but also painful, yearning, and something that can be hard to watch. That is what makes this movie a classic and one of Hitchcock's best movies in a long line of memorable, successful movies. I really enjoyed the film and the dark attributes it possesses. Hitchcock's film is about a retired detective named Scottie who suffers from acrophobia, or the fear of heights. He is tasked by a former colleague to follow his wife, who has been acting strange lately. Scottie reluctantly agrees to take the case. Once he does, he realizes something strange is happening. Not only that, he begins to take a painful obsession over this girl, Madeleine. We get some fine, professional displays of acting here. James Stewart does a great job as Scottie. He, along with the new camera-work displayed by Hitchcock, really showed how paranoid he is with heights. And that really gave me the creeps just watching him be hesitant to even climb stairs. Kim Novak does a great job in two roles of hers, especially as Madeleine Elster. She brings a sensitivity to her character which I found to be reassuring when it comes to female characters during this era. Overall, Vertigo is a very suspenseful thriller that is often scary to watch. If you have seen this film and suffer from agoraphobia, perhaps this is the film to blame. But nonetheless, films like these is why Hitchcock have been called the master of suspense. Even conversations have an aura of what is going to happen next? The ending is unexpected and really good. If you like masterful suspense films, then Vertigo is the film for you. My Grade: A-",9,4,6,17 August 2015
Black Swan," Haunting Epic!
","Black Swan is a magnificent film led by a performance-of-the-ages by Natalie Portman and outstanding direction by Darren Aronofsky. This is not a movie about ballet as some people think, but it is a film that is more about a ballet dancer and her inner demons. This movie is almost a borderline horror film but it's a thriller that works at a very high level.This film is about a ballet dancer, Nina who wins the role of Swan Lake. This role turns out to be giving her a hard time as she battles her inner demons, a rival dancer, a stern but caring mother, and a not-so-impressed ballet teacher.This is Natalie Portman's best role she has ever done. She deserves her Oscar win one hundred percent. I really felt bad for her character, Nina and all what was going on with her. The supporting cast gave brilliant, chilling performances.Overall, this is one of the better recent melodramatic thrillers I have seen. After the first ten minutes, I did not know whether I would like this or not. But the rest of the movie made up my mind for me. I rate this film 9/10.",9,2,4,17 January 2013
Changeling," Very Moving Tale!
","Changeling is a great but sad movie. There will be points in the film when the tears will break out. Even all the guys like myself shed a few tears. This is an emotionally gripping film that is based on a true story eighty one years ago.A devoted mother, Christine Collins lives with her son. One day, she left her son at home and went to work. When she came home, her son is missing. She went to the corrupt LAPD for assistance. They found a boy that appeared to be her son. But he was not. Now, Collins is searching for her true son.The acting is amazing. Angelina Jolie should have had some serious consideration for Best Actress at the Academy Awards last week. John Malkovich is a great reverend.The score is great. Clint Eastwood is great at making music even if the music is sometimes repetitive.There are movies that can succeed in today's world without special effects and weak story lines. This is one of them. I rate this film 10/10.",10,3,4,1 March 2009
Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," For a Fourth Entry, It Rocks!
","Honestly, I thought the new entry in the lucrative Pirates of the Caribbean franchise is actually not has half-bad as many people claim it to be. Going into this movie, I expected to see my favorite hero return and a bunch of well-placed action and explosions. That is what I signed up for and that is what I got. Also, this movie focuses on Jack Sparrow rather than other characters. I'm glad that happened because we got to learn more about Jack.The fourth entry into the series is about how Jack 'teams' up with Blackbeard and how they find their way to the Fountain of Youth.I'm glad Johnny Depp reprised his role as Jack because no one can play Jack like Johnny can. Geoffrey Rush returns as Barbossa and he still is good. I thought Ian McShane was a sinister villain and Penelope Cruz was a nice addition.Overall, this was a fun film that featured that good, ol' swash-buckling action. I was happy to see that they added the element of mermaids into the movie. This movie reminds me of the fourth Indiana Jones movie. People didn't like it much but I really did. That is how I feel about this movie. I rate this film 9/10.",9,0,2,8 February 2013
Men in Black 3," Welcome Back, Men In Black!
","Now it seems like I am one of the few whom actually enjoyed the second installment in this franchise when it came out a decade ago, so I was looking forward to this film. Even though no one in particular was asking for Men in Black 3, it's nice to welcome them with open arms. This film has all the elements that made the first film so genius. It has the duo of Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith, great, offbeat creature designs, some wise humor, and a villain who is not only menacing, but has some punch lines.Barry Sonnenfeld returns at the directing helm and he directs a film in a franchise that put him on the map. Agents K and J return and J has to travel to the past where he must prevent the younger K from being murdered.I'm glad both Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones returned because it's not Men in Black without them. They still have excellent chemistry and I still love how Agent J gets to poke fun at Agent K's non-changing demeanor. However, I have to mention Josh Brolin. His portrayal of younger K is uncanny. I felt like he was actually Tommy Lee Jones for a second. Jermaine Clement makes a convincing and pretty scary villain.Overall, this is a great welcome back to our Men in Black. As critics pointed out, this film largely improves on it's predecessor. It also helps there are several emotional moments that give us some clues on the younger days of J and K. I really liked this movie thanks to great acting, a good story, and something just to keep my childhood fresh. I rate this film 9/10.",9,2,4,21 December 2013
The New World," Gotta Love Terrence Malick!
","When you watch enough movies like I have, you will have the ability to tell who directed a movie just based off cinematography and visuals. I could tell right away this is a Terrence Malick film thanks to his wonderful, stunning visuals portrayed in The New World. This movie can be a little long and the script doesn't seem to be that sharp, but Malick's direction and above-average acting makes this a wonderful history lesson to behold.This film is the true story of the Pocahontas legend. This story tells the story of how the early colonists landed in Jamestown and one them, John Smith forges a relationship with one of the natives that will change their lives.This film is acted very well. Colin Farrell doesn't get the recognition he deserves especially when he stars in films like this. We don't see Christian Bale until the later part of the movie but he has a nice, toned-down performance unlike his Batman film which came out the same year.Overall, this is a film just worth seeing for it's majestic beauty. It's almost a crime that it underperformed at the box office. This could have been a perfect movie thanks to the source material, but it is held down slightly by a weaker script than I expected and some choppy editing but all-in-all I was very pleased. I rate this film 8/10.",8,0,2,31 March 2013
Scarface," Good, But Overrated!
","Scarface is not a bad movie but compared to the gangster films from 1970-1995, it's only mediocre. Al Pacino, of course, was the best part of the movie. The premise is very interesting, at least enough for me to watch all three hours of the film. This movie has over-the-top violence but I respect that because these kind of movies feature violence all the time.This is about some Cuban guy who comes to America to gain power, wealth, drugs, and women. But he realizes all the power is not the best thing in the world.As I mentioned before, Pacino is the best part of the film. To make viewers aware, Tony Montana is very different than Michael Corelone. It was nice to see Michelle Pfeiffer.Overall, this is a good gangster movie but some scenes were tedious and over stretched. The best part of the film is the first half hour then things go downhill but not too bad. I rate this film 7/10.",7,0,3,4 November 2010
Frost_Nixon," A Look Back At Our President!
","Frost/Nixon is a great reenactment of the famous interview British talk-host David Frost had with recently-resigned former President Richard Nixon. This movie, although not perfect, is very capable of holding the attention of the audience. That takes a great deal of effort because this film is all talk and has no action. But in a way, the words themselves are the action of this film.This film is about how Richard Nixon and David Frost prepare for their interview, how they did the interview, and the aftermath.The acting is very good. Frank Langella made a great Richard Nixon. Michael Sheen makes an even better David Frost. I liked how he always kept his cool even when things did not work out for him.Overall, this is a eventful film that stays true to the interview. Ron Howard directed another great film. However if you are not into talkfests, I would stay away from this. I rate this film 8/10.",8,0,0,10 October 2012
Walk the Line," Joaquin Phoenix is the new Johnny Cash!
","James Mangold's Walk the Line is a very powerful, accurate biography on the iconic country music star, Johnny Cash. This film boasts powerful performances from Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon. They both sang live and they both can sing! In fact, Phoenix sounded remarkably like Johnny Cash.This film tells the life of Johnny and how he led a troubled life that began with his drunken father blaming him for his brother's death. The movie goes through the times when he became an alcoholic and a drug user. The film also goes through his love life and his crooning for June Carter.The acting is very good. Phoenix and Witherspoon are excellent casting choices. They sang very well and had powerful performances. I liked Robert Patrick as Johnny's father. Patrick didn't hold anything back and he let his true father-like resentment come out on top.Overall, this is a very good film about the legendary Johnny Cash. I liked how the songs were used in the movie because many of them are my favorites. Honestly, I liked Phoenix's version of 'Walk the Line' better than Cash's. I won't spoil anything here, but the last two scenes are the best scenes in the movie. I rate this film 10/10.",10,0,0,6 March 2013
Alien 3," Great, But I Have Seen Better Sequels!
","Alien 3 is a pretty good movie. There were several things I was disappointed with in the plot. Overall, I enjoyed watching Ripley versus Alien the third time around.The story takes place right after Aliens. As soon as Hicks, Newt, and Ripley escape, they crash land on a desolated prison planet. Only Ripley survives. She finds out that an alien has boarded the ship and is now loose on the planet. Ripley must unite with the prisoners to defeat the deadly foe.The acting is still pretty good compared with the first two films. Weaver as Ripley is powerful displaying her emotions. Some of the prisoner actors were great too especially the black guy. There are a few things I am disappointed with. I am displeased when animals die gruesome deaths such as the dog did when the alien attacked him. I was sad to see Ripley commit suicide. She ends up being a clone in movie number four. I think that David Fincher did a good job. This is one of his first projects.I rate this movie 9/10.",9,3,56,31 December 2008
Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," Welcome Back Sherlock!
","Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows is the second installment in the Sherlock Holmes franchise and it does not disappoint. While it lacks the charm of the first film, it makes up for that with the thrills, wit, and some clever action. It also makes use for the slo-mo scenes that made the first one really enjoyable. Also this film has a better and popular villain that all fans of Sherlock Holmes know of: Professor James Moriarty.Guy Ritchie's film joins Sherlock and Watson together on another adventure and this time they aim to stop the evil Professor Moriarty from destroying the world.This movie works because of the wit and interplay of Robert Downey Jr and Jude Law. Just like Iron Man, I can't see anyone else playing a better Sherlock than Downey. I love his sardonic attitude and it's a nice feature to give to Sherlock. Jude makes a good Watson and I really can't see anyone doing better. Jared Harris makes a good Moriarty. I didn't know what to expect out of him.Overall, this is a really fun film. While it doesn't improve on the first film, it's still a welcome addition to the Sherlock Holmes franchise. This movie is action-packed and it features some cool stunts. it doesn't hurt to have scenes where Downey dresses in drag. I rate this film 9/10.",9,0,2,3 June 2013
Gremlins," Good Movie!
","I liked Gremlins. I was not expecting much because I thought that this film was one of those ridiculous 80's horror films. But, when I saw the names of Steven Spielberg and Joe Dante, I decided to give this movie a try. I was pleased at the result.This film starts with an inventor buying an unusual gift for his son, a Mogwai. They are cute creatures, but there are three important rules they must follow. When all these rules are broken, the Mogwai transforms into nastier creatures. They decide to wreak some havoc.The acting is good. I liked Zach Galligan, Pheobe Cates, Corey Feldman, and Judge Reinhold. They set the tone of the film.The special effects are great. I liked the creatures and in today movies, they would still look real.The score by Jerry Goldsmith is another beauty of a score.There is a great mixture of comedy and horror. I was either laughing or cowering. This is not the best film ever, but it's still pretty good. I rate this film 8/10.",8,0,2,22 June 2009
The Incredible Hulk," Incredibly Great!
","The Incredible Hulk is a great movie, another success to the Marvel company and superhero films even though Hulk is not really a superhero. This movie is much better than Ang Lee's 2003 version. I did not not see that version, but the trailers for that Hulk are dumb and the reviews were not too good. Anyway, Bruce Banner turns into the Hulk because his experiment went wrong. Now, Banner is being pursued by the relentless general and his sidekick, Blonsky. While being pursued, Banner/Hulk is helped by the general's daughter, Elizabeth Ross and doctors like Dr. Sterns. The visual effects are very good. They are not cheap effects as there is supposedly in Lee's version. The acting is decent especially Edward Norton and William Hurt. Tim Roth and his character is a bit annoying and it's hard to understand his accent. I liked Blonsky's transformation. He is bigger and stronger than the Hulk himself. This is another success for Marvel. I rate this movie 9/10.",9,3,5,15 November 2008
The Monuments Men," Interesting Movie!
","The Monuments Men is a very interesting movie based off a little-known section of the U.S Army during the Second World War and that is the Monuments Men who were charged with saving valuable pieces of artwork in war-torn Europe. The movie itself wasn't bad, but it had much higher potential. The story and the cast are excellent, but the way the story presented itself was an issue. The screenplay tries to inject comedy into the film, but the this film would have worked better as a serious drama. That being said, I did enjoy the film and it was a highly- involving film based on an important historical study. George Clooney's film is about how a man named Frank Stokes is charged with putting together a team of officers to go to Europe and track down stolen art from the Nazis and return them to their rightful owners. The film has a very stacked cast and each one of their moment to shine. George Clooney of course is great as Frank Stokes, and the same can be said about Matt Damon as Clooney's right-hand man, James Granger. Bill Murray and John Goodman add a little humor to the film. I also liked the casting of Bob Balaban and Cate Blanchett, although I could have used some more scenes involving Cate. Overall, The Monuments Men is the not the greatest war film ever made but it's an important film telling a story about the men who risked their lives to preserve our culture and our history and in that regard, they did a very good job in doing so. The movie works, but its main issue is the loosely-structured screenplay as the film is all over the place. But the acting and production values are top-notch. I rate this film 8/10.",8,1,2,10 February 2015
Miracle," Biggest Moment in American Sports History!
","Miracle is an inspirational sports film that touches on the what is mostly likely the best moment in American sports history. Thanks to a marvelous, powerful performance by Kurt Russell, the story goes from a clichéd mess to a very powerful, heartfelt story. This is your typical sports film with the main team as an underdog going against all odds to be number one. But unlike many sports film, this is actually a true story.Gavin O'Connor's film takes place during the Cold War and it spotlights on the 1980 Olympics. The film has the underdog, fresh-faced American hockey team versus the intimidating, experienced Soviet team. The film mostly talks about Herb Brooks and how he got his team into shape to face off against the Soviets.The acting is really good. Kurt Russell really adds new blood to the story and his role as Herb Brooks is most likely why this film is so moving. The other actors did solid too. Honestly, I see no reason why Patricia Clarkson should have been in this movie. All she does is play the role of the complaining wife. I liked how no-name people were cast as the players and they were really good.Overall, this is a truly inspirational sports film full of choking-up moments. I liked how they incorporated some history in the film so that the younger viewers would learn some important history. It's very predictable as it should be, because this was more than just a game. It's a symbol of American pride during these troubled times. This is how a sports movie should be made. I rate this film 9/10.",9,1,1,29 July 2013
Mission: Impossible III," Great Action Scenes, No Developed Story!
","Mission:Impossible is good. MI:2 is great. MI:3 is pretty good and a worthy addition to the series. It did not do too great at the box office this time around. I am surprised at that. It must be because of Tom Cruise's antics a few years back.Ethan Hunt returns to action. He retired from the field and now he has to go back on the field to rescue an agent he personally trained and eventually his own wife. He has to defeat the evil guy who is the evilest out of the three villains in the series in my opinion.Cruise did a decent job. He may be getting along in years, but that doesn't stop his stunts. The rest of the cast is great such as Ving Rhames, Michelle Monaghan, Maggie Q, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Billy Crudup, Jonathan Rhys Meyers, and Laurence Fishburne.As with most action movies, the action and stunts are great. The special effects were just as good. The plot can be considered weak. I did not expect much of a plot or script because this is solely an action movie.Overall, this is a great movie and a fine end to a series. I rate this movie 8/10.",8,0,1,15 February 2009
Captain Phillips," A Lightning-Tense Thriller!
","Captain Phillips hearkens upon a story based off contemporary global issues and one of these issues is pirates. Not Blackbeard-style pirates, but more along the lines of modern Somalian pirates whom prey upon ships in their waters. This movie is a riveting tale about once incident in 2009 and how the Americans, led by Richard Phillips and the pirates try to outfox each other. The film is nothing short of tense and taut and if the film was even tenser, your mind would explode in half. This is the cat-and-mouse game at its finest. The acting is great and I even liked the shaky-camera route, as the film does have some Bourne elements to it.Paul Greengrass, the man behind the Jason Bourne sequels and United 93, directs a film about a captain of a merchant ship, Richard Phillips is taken hostage by Somalian pirates, led by Abduwali Muse. Trying to stay alive and make it home safely, Phillips must stay ahead of the game and predict every move Muse will make.The film has fantastic acting. Tom Hanks is splendid as always and one of the emotional scenes involves him in the very end. As good as Hanks is, it might surprise you that newcomer Barkhad Abdi matches everything Hanks delivers and their scenes together are just powerful. It's very uncommon to have an actor come out of nowhere and be nominated for an Oscar. That's how good Abdi was, especially when going head-to-head with Tom Hanks.Overall, Captain Phillips is an excellent movie that sheds light on how piracy is a problem in Africa/the Middle East and the dangers they pose on American ships. The film is written very well and it has some of the best dialog of 2013. The interchange between Hanks and Abdi just shows it all. Like what he did in United 93, Greengrass takes a true story and keeps it grounded without sacrificing any of the emotion that is required to keep the characters interesting. This is another success for Greengrass and a taut, tense thriller on the whole. I rate this film 9/10.",9,0,2,22 December 2014
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Underrated!
","I saw so many people bashing this movie all because of Jar Jar Binks. I don't believe he belongs in this movie and he was annoying but other than that this movie is pretty good. It's not as good as the original trilogy but it's still watchable. I will admit the special effects are pretty bad. It seemed like I was watching a movie from the late 60's-early 70's.This prequel is about young Anakin and his slave life from which he was eventually freed by two Jedi who were on his planet only by accident.I though the acting is good at least by Liam Neeson, Ewan McGregor, and Natalie Portman. I wish Samuel L. Jackson had more screen time. Jake Lloyd is okay as young Anakin.Tha action scenes were great. Darth Maul is a a formidable character and it's too bad he did not have much speaking lines. I also have to mention Yoda did not look right in this film.Overall, this is a worthy entry to the Star Wars saga. I rate this film 8/10.",8,9,16,11 December 2010
Sucker Punch," Great Visuals, Bad Story!
","Zach Snyder, the director behind films such as 300 and Watchmen is back with his new live-action movie, Sucker Punch. This movie has impressive visuals as all his films do, but sadly this movie lacks an effective story. It has a great premise and all, but the screenplay should have been written much better. Zach Synder needs to learn a lesson on how to properly tell a story but other than that, I did have a somewhat fun time watching this film.This movie is about a girl who is submitted to a mental ward. She and a couple of other girls are forced to dance. When they dance, they leave reality for fantasy and they try to escape that mental asylum.The acting is okay nothing worth commenting on. The characters are not that memorable even though the lead actors are quite beautiful. I do wish to say that Emily Browning has grown up a lot since her last big film, 2004's A Series of Unfortunate Events.Overall, this is a movie that could and should have been much better. If the story was there, this would have been a great movie. I also really disliked the soundtrack. I could not stand the heavy-metal, headache-inducing music. But despite that, I did think there were good moments and I had a fun time for the most part. This is a film to watch if there is nothing else to watch. I rate this film 6/10.",6,2,4,2 February 2013
The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," Possibly the Best in the Series Yet!
","I know the Twilight films have been vilified since the first film was released in 2008. These films are actually not as bad as I feared and the fourth addition, Breaking Dawn Part 1 continues that trend for me. Yes, there are some cheesy romance scenes, but as a whole the movie works for me. Also what works is how this movie happens to portray one of the best childbirth scenes ever filmed and the director, Bill Condon did a great job delivering suspenseful and emotional moments leading up to that memorable scene.Bill Condon's film takes the adventure of Bella, Edward, and Jacob to the next level. The governing vampire body is growing a bit too close onto the Cullen clan and the relationship between the vampires and the wolves are growing worse thanks to the baby growing rapidly in Bella's stomach.The acting is really not that bad. Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson are comfortable with their roles despite participating in some cheesy romance scenes and delivering some head-shaking lines. The rest of the cast works pretty well. When the first film came out, I always thought Billy Burke was the best part of the film. Three films later, I still hold that opinion.Overall, this is a darker, more brooding Twilight film. There is not much action sequences because Part 1 is simply setting up for Part 2. I actually have high hopes that Part 2 can deliver a fitting finale. I rate this film 8/10.",8,1,6,22 May 2013
The Perks of Being a Wallflower," A Modern Teen-Angst Masterpiece!
","The Perks of Being a Wallflower is the greatest film about growing up/high school in recent years and it wouldn't be a stretch to say of all time. It's so heartfelt and earnest which is rare to find in films these days. The abstract characterization is what makes this film and I'm sure all of us can relate to at least one character here. This film will make you happy and sad and will make you want to relive these years again despite the thought that high school is utter hell.Stephen Chbosky, who actually wrote the book the film is based on, expertly directs this coming-of-age tale. This movie is about a guy named Charlie who is a freshman at his high school and is haunted by past events. He also has trouble making friends, but that changes when he meets these two seniors named Patrick and Sam. With some friends, he is able to experience the notions of friendship and love.This film has a talented young cast. Logan Lerman is a good young actor and seems to get better as he gets older. His performance here is very powerful and provocative. People seem to hate on Emma Watson, but she does a great job in shedding her Harry Potter image here. Ezra Miller does fantastic as the flamboyant Patrick.Overall, the Perks of Being a Wallflower is an amazing coming-of-age film and perhaps the greatest one ever made. I have made connections with many of these films, but never like this film. This is a beautiful indie that talks about the hell that is high school and the notions of love and friendship and how it can change a life. It's a powerful, emotionally-driven film with strong performances and a great script. I rate this film 10/10.",10,1,2,31 March 2014
3:10 to Yuma," Welcome Back Westerns!
","3:10 to Yuma is one of those movies that are trying to make the western genre popular again in Hollywood. I think they got popular again with the recent success of the Coen's True Grit. I am not a big fan of westerns but I did enjoy Dance with the Wolves greatly.This movie is a remake of the western that came out fifty years prior. it's about a poor rancher who wants to bring a murderous outlaw to justice by transporting him to a train that will take him to prison. But he will face many dangerous factors along the way.The acting is perfect. Russell Crowe is a great actor and he continues his line of excellent work. The same goes along for Christian Bale. I haven't seen a movie of his that I hated.The music by Beltrami is great. I see why it was nominated for an Academy Award. Even though this is a western and reminds me of the older westerns, there is enough sense of modernism here to make it seem new. I rate this film 10/10.",10,1,2,11 January 2011
The Expendables 2," Action-Packed Extravaganza!
","The Expendables 2, the much-awaited sequel to 2010's surprise hit the Expendables, is a good, old-fashioned action film. In some ways, it manages to be just as good or perhaps a little better than the original. Of course we should not expect Oscar-worthy acting or a well-written script. But with the brain in shut-down mode, this film gives one hell of a ride.Simon West's film has he return of Barney Ross and his gun-toting team as Church sends them on a mission to the Soviet Union that should be a piece of cake. But when something goes wrong and one of their comrades has fallen, they look for revenge and we know things are going to go down.This film boasts an star-studded cast with some big action names. Sly Stallone returns of course but so does Jason Statham, Jet Li, Terry Crews, Randy Couture, and Dolph Lundgren. It was good to see that both Willis and Schwarzenegger have bigger roles this time around. Jean Claude Van Damme and Chuck Norris make very good additions to the cast. They all may be old, but they are still good enough to pile on a pretty hefty body count.Overall, this is one action-packed sequel and it effectively pays homage to the old-school action films of the 80's and 90's. This film is also has some funny moments here with all the witty one-liners that appear often and they got a few chuckles out of me. If you come in looking for nonstop action, then this is the movie for you. I rate this film 9/10.",9,2,3,18 February 2014
The Longest Yard," Funny Movie!
","I always enjoy watching Adam Sandler movies because he's always funny. I don't care what his critics say but I think he's a very good actor. He knows the definition of comedy. This film is probably the most kid-friendly. I didn't hear that much of bad language compared to his other movies.This is a remake of a 1970's film. Paul Crewe, a former football pro, is arrested for drunk driving. He is sent to prison. While there, the warden asks Crewe to put together a football team so they can compete against the guards.I really was happy to see Burt Reynolds. He really did great in the original. He does the same here. The rest of the cast is great. It was funny watching Tracy Morgan and his 'girls.' Overall, this is a funny movie and another Sandler classic. I rate this film 9/10.",9,0,1,1 July 2010
Source Code," Smart, Satisfying, and Smart yet again!
","Despite 2011 having a down box office year, the first half was full of original sci-fi films such as Limitless and Paul. Now we are treated to Duncan Jone's Source Code which is absolutely wonderful. Yes, the plot is very preposterous but the way Duncan handled the plot is just amazing. He was able to create a story with strong human characters and a beating heart amidst all the action going on.This film is about an army captain, Colter Stevens who is recruited to go back in time before a terrorist attack that happened on a train and find out how the attack happened and who was the mastermind.Jake Gyllenhaal and Michelle Monaghan give great performances. Jake did a much better job than he did in Prince of Persia. I thought the emotional acting came from Vera Farmiga. She did great as the lady who has to make some very extreme choices.Overall, this is a really smart film that is filled with emotion. There are some cleverly-done action scenes and heart-wrenching human drama moments. I wish more sci-fi films were made like this. This film is a good example of what science fiction should be. I hope to see Duncan Jones make films like these in the future. I rate this film 9/10.",9,0,1,3 February 2013
Skyfall," Best Bond Movie To Hit The Silver Screen!
","Who knew that bringing Sam Mendes on board to direct the 23rd James Bond film would result in the best James Bond film ever. Don't get me wrong but even though I like Sam Mendes, I wouldn't think he would be cut out for a Bond film. Well, this film feels like a classic Bond film with some modern updates attached to it. People says this feels like a Bourne film, and in a good way it does. This film is action-packed, has a great theme song(I usually hate Adele's songs), wonderful acting, a great score, and superb visuals.Mendes's film has Daniel Craig returning for his third adventure as James Bond. MI5 has been infiltrated from within and it's up to Bond to single-handedly save his agency, career, and the career of M.As usual, Daniel Craig kicks mighty ass as Bond. We see him getting older but of course, he knows it. I like his wisecracks about his age. Judi Dench plays a bigger role this time around and is superb. She should have been nominated for an Oscar. Javier Bardem, just like in No Country For Old Men, does very well as the psychopath villain. Ralph Fiennes is a welcome addition to the cast and supplements Dench very well.Overall, this is an amazing Bond film and I'm proud to say it's the best of the series. It's a classic Bond in a modern world and it brings that feeling to life. There is lots of action here and it has some amazing set pieces. With the addition of Mendes, he brought some character building here and because of that, we care more about the characters. If you're looking for action, cars, and girls, they are all here. I rate this film 10/10.",10,2,12,15 April 2014
50 First Dates," One of the best comedies of 2004
","I saw this movie while scanning the shelves for a movie or two and this film caught my eye. I heard it was funny so I brought it. It turned out this movie was definitely worth my money. I thought that this movie was absolutely hilarious. There are times though when the movie might make you cry. The script was written well, the acting was excellent, and the music worked with the film. Sandler did a good job and worked well with Drew Barrymore. Rob Schneider was a good fit for this movie as well. He was very funny! This is Sandler's best since Big Daddy in 1999. I highly recommend this for everybody. Trust me, your time and money will not be wasted.",9,1,2,5 December 2007
Catch Me If You Can," Very Entertaining!
","Catch Me If You Can is a very entertaining film. Even though there is not much action, the whole dilemma of the con artists is good enough. The plot is about a con artist named Frank Abagnale Jr and the way he tried to avoid authorities including Carl played by Tom Hanks. The acting in this film is very good. Leonardo DiCaprio and Tom Hanks had very good chemistry together. I liked the way how DiCaprio was able to perform Abagnale. The whole concept of this film is highly interesting. it's nice to learn how con artists operated back in the 60's. The music by John Williams is another classic but it is different than his usual music. You can tell that it's by Williams, but the music has more of a jazz sound. Overall, this is a very good drama by Steven Spielberg. I rate this movie 10/10.",10,2,4,9 October 2008
The Hangover," Hilarious!
","This is a really funny movie. I'm glad I got a chance to see this but unfortunately it had to wait until DVD. I chose to watch the newest Harry Potter movie instead of this. But I think it was a good choice. Anyway, I wasn't expecting much but I heard so much about this film and I see why everyone likes this.On the day before Doug's wedding day, he and his friends decided to get drunk and have a party. When they woke up the next morning, Doug was missing. Now they have to find Doug before the wedding or else they're screwed.There are many hilarious jokes in here. My favorite scenes involved the tiger and the baby. I just loved the baby scene. I really can't wait to see Hangover 2. I rate this film 9/10.",9,1,2,4 June 2010
Ghost," Very Touching and Romantic!
","Ghost is one of the best romance stories ever made and it is not hard to see why this film became an instant classic. I liked the spin to the eons-old romance tale by introducing the afterlife aspect. This film works very well as a romance story as well as a mystery thriller and it has one of the most happy-sad endings I have ever seen in a Hollywood film. The film also work its magic through the use of music thanks to Maurice Jarre's wonderful score and the use of the Righteous Brothers. Jerry Zucker's film is about a couple named Sam and Molly who are happily in love. During a botched mugging, Sam is shot to death. Sam comes back as a ghost and he realizes that he was murdered and that Molly is in danger. With the help of a reluctant psychic, Sam must communicate with his wife if he wants to protect her. Each actor added some dimension to their roles. Firstly, the chemistry between Patrick Swayze and Demi Moore is very believable and realistic. They both do a great job in their roles. I was particularly fond of Swayze and his attempts to communicate with the real world. Whoopi Goldberg does a wonderful job as the psychic not wanting to do with the events. Tony Goldwyn made a good villain, even if he was a little bit of a scaredy-cat. Overall, Ghost is a 90's classic and I really hope this film won't be a victim of the remakes craze that has been infesting upon Hollywood these days. The film is a mixture of mystery and romance and it delivers a touching story without being overly saccharine. I find this film the second most touching romance of the 90's after Titanic. This film is certainly has its share of unchained melodies. My Grade: A",9,2,3,12 March 2015
Iron Man 3," Here Begins The Post-Avengers!
","Iron Man 3 is the first Marvel film to be released since 2012's mega-hit, The Avengers. If this movie is any indication, I think we are off to a very good start. All things considered, this may be the best film in the Iron Man franchise to date. The story arc keeps getting better, especially when Tony Stark takes off with Nolan-esque emotions and of course, with the rather infamous twist that I happened to like. The CGI is the best of the series and that is evident in the action-packed scenes involving all the suits. I guess it's true that better technology means better effects.Shane Black, known for his extraordinary writing skills, directs the third installment in the Iron Man franchise. Several months after the events of The Avengers, Stark has not been himself as he suffers from post traumatic disorder. But he must get into gear quick as a terrorist organization known as 'The Mandarin' begins to create havoc in the world.As always with the Iron Man films, the acting is very good. Robert Downey Jr. is spot-on as Tony Stark. Despite his depression at times, he manages to keep the clever wit that we all love. Gwyneth Paltrow has some shining moments as Pepper. Ben Kingsley makes a very fine addition to the cast as the Mandarin, and of course having talents like Guy Pearce and Rebecca Hall helps as well. We also might have to keep an eye out on Ty Simpkins, the young boy that Stark grows pretty close to. He may be a star one day.Overall, Iron Man 3 is an action-packed, character-driven film and it continues the success of above-average superhero films. Scores of people bash on the twist, but I think it was excellent and it added some light-heartiness to the movie. I liked the addition of a voice-over because it seems to have added more feeling to the movie. The CGI is excellent and those flying suits were a great achievement. Now with Iron Man 3 behind us, I'm eagerly awaiting the next Marvel installment. I rate this movie 9/10.",9,20,33,21 August 2014
Raiders of the Lost Ark," One of the best Adventure Films!
","The Raiders of the Ark is a fantastic adventure film. This is one of the better films of the 1980's. Harrison Ford plays the mighty, whip-lashing Indiana Jones. Jones must uncover and save the mysterious ark from the Nazis. The acting in this film is top-rate. Harrison Ford is just amazing as he usually is. I also liked Karen Allen as Marion. She was just utterly great. As usual, Spielberg did a good job with his directing. The score by John Williams is catchy and memorable. The theme song is still stuck in my head. My only complaint about this film is that the film is a bit too dark. I wish that the film would lighten up a bit. Other than that, this is a fun movie. I rate this film a 10/10.",10,2,4,9 August 2008
Spartacus," A Fun Ride!
","Spartacus is a historical epic that follows amongst the footsteps of prior historical epics such as Ben-Hur and the Ten Commandments. I have to admit this film is not nearly as great as those, but I am certainly not bashing this film. The fact is, the film is a tad overlong and the dialogue does not hold up well by today's standards. I can appreciate the fine performances, especially Ustinov's Oscar-winning performance, as well as the steady direction of a legend, Stanley Kubrick. The film has some great action sequences and as a history student, I can appreciate the historical aspect of this film. I also like, unlike other films of its time, where we are not stuffed the obligatory happy ending. Thus, that makes me appreciate this epic even more.Kubrick's film talks about a slave uprising during the Roman era. Spartacus is a slave who does not take pleasure at the fact he is being used to fight at a gladiator school only to receive spoiled girls. He and the rest of the slaves revolt which causes other slaves in the countryside to do the same. Crassus, who is aiming to become a dictator, decides to meet Spartacus and his men in battle.I really enjoyed the performances in this film. I liked Kirk Douglas's strength and perseverance as Spartacus. I liked the comedic timing in Peter Ustinov's performance as the head of the gladiatorial school, Batiatus. Jean Simmons gives a mighty fine performance as Spartacu's lover, Varinia. Finally, I really liked Laurence Olivier's deep, intense performance as Crassus, who wants nothing except for political power.Overall, Spartacus is a fine, entertaining historical spectacle. It features some majestic battle sequences and many fine, if perhaps a little outdated performances. The screenplay was excellent, as it was written by none other than the black-listed screenwriter, Dalton Trumbo. Compared to today's quality, the film doesn't live up to it. But I had a fun time watching this historical epic. Not Kubrick's best, but that doesn't stop it from being a fun watch.My Grade: B+",8,0,0,24 August 2015
Stop-Loss," A Tragic Insight On The Emotions of War!
","By definition, Stop-Loss is an order issued by the United States that would extend one's time in action after their time serving is done during times of war. This movie is a powerful, tragic look on the trauma soldiers face after leaving the action. We see how these lives are far from normal and how war not only personally affects them, but the lives around them. This film may be seen to have a political agenda, but then again the Iraqi war was all just for political nonsense in the first place.Kimberly Peirce's film is about a U.S Army Staff Sergeant named Brandon who becomes traumatized along with this two friends back home after he accidentally killed innocent people overseas. While thinking he is home for good, he realizes that he is going to be sent back despite his resistance.This film is well-acted and is full of rising stars. Ryan Phillippe does a good job as Brandon and he makes us sympathize for him and practically every soldier on he job. Channing Tatum is pretty good even though I felt he seemed a little wooden and moody. Joseph Gordon-Levitt is my favorite actor in this movie and I wish I saw more of him in the movie.Overall, this is a powerful take on what war will do to you and how it will change you. This is a film about today's generation of wars and how powerful they have become. Like it or not, the United States was in a war for no reason and despite all the bravery, these young men were dying for no reason. That is what the message of the film is. It's an underrated, but vastly powerful film. I rate this film 9/10.",9,1,1,18 December 2013
United 93," Could Have Been Better!
","I was really anticipating this movie. Despite the controversy, I heard great things about this movie. I was looking forward to watching this almost ten years after the original tragedy. I was let down somewhat. Maybe it was because I was sick and had a bad headache while watching this, but I was disappointed.This is about the one of the hijacked planes on September 11, 2001 and how it got hijacked before its doom in the fields of Pennsylvania.The acting isn't that bad. The actors are unknown but they were decent. There was some over acting in moments though.The reason I didn't like this movie as much as I thought because it was simply boring. The first half was just airport people blabbing to each other.However, the final 20 minutes of the film is powerful and emotional and hence thats why this movie gets a 5/10.",6,1,4,27 February 2011
Deja Vu," Interesting Concept!
","Deja Vu is a good movie with a mind-bending twist, good action scenes, and a plot that is hardly understandable unless you have the scientific mind like me. This film also boasts a good director-actor pairup in Tony Scott and Denzel Washington. This movie can be confusing at times because it is one that will make you think and the plot has many scientific terms especially regarding time travel.Tony Scott's film is about a ATF officer who is taken off a site of a ferry explosion to an area where he is told about some new machine that can take people back in the past to see if they can find any information about the crime.This is the second pairup between Tony and Denzel with the first being the 2004's Man on Fire, which is better than this film. However, Denzel still has what it takes to be a lead actor and his personality takes this movie out of mediocrity. This film also supports a well-rounded supporting cast with the likes of Val Kilmer, Bruce Greenwood, and Paula Patton.Overall, this is a energetic, fast-paced, and skillful movie. It features some very good editing and cinematography which is always present in a Tony Scott movie. Despite that, I felt Tony could have done better with this film. It's not a classic by any stretch but I wanted more of a story to be told. But, I admit I loved the style of the movie. I may be generous, but I rate this film 8/10.",8,2,3,8 March 2013
E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," A Momentious Classic!
","E.T is in my top 10 movies of the 1980's. It's a wonderful story about the bonding of a boy and a lost alien. The alien, ET is left behind by his mates when they were being chased. He soons ends up in the shed of the boy, Elliot. Elliot discovers ET and before he knows it, the two are linked together. But, ET is soon discovered by NASA and all sort of things happen. I will admit that the ending can be a bit tearful. The only thing that can be said as negative is that parts of the film goes a bit slow. The acting is brilliant. The children had great chemistry working together. The score by the masterful John Williams is momentious. It's one of his best scores. Overall, Steven Spielberg did a great job. I rate this film a 9/10.",9,1,2,4 May 2008
Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter," Fun and Entertaining For What It Is!
","As a fun summer popcorn movie, Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter is good at what it's supposed to be doing: to entertain. Despite such an outlandish concept, the movie works because it's so fun to watch. I mean who never thought about the beloved President killing supernatural creatures. I think it's a crazy, but fun idea that works for the most part. Yes, it takes itself a little too seriously, but it has great CGI, a wonderfully-crafted script, plenty of action, and the film just tells a untold, different history of the United States.Based of the entertaining book by Seth-Graeme Smith, Timur Bekmambetov's film tells us the untold story about our 16th President. After seeing his mother get killed by a vampire, Lincoln seeks the help of a Henry Sturgess to learn how to kill vampires. As President, he realizes the Confederacy has vampires and he has an agenda to defeat them.The acting is actually pretty good for the type of film it is. I didn't think Benjamin Walker could pull this role off. I'm still a little iffy, but he did better than I thought. Dominic Cooper and Rufus Sewell were good in their respective roles. Mary Elizabeth Winstead makes a really good Mary Todd Lincoln.Overall, this is a decent summer fare that is nothing but fun. Anything that has Lincoln killing vampires, I'd watch anyday. Of course, this film is not going to be historically accurate but should clarify that for people's sake. The CGI is effective and the vampires seemed rather realistic and pretty scary. There is lots of action and the final thirty minutes has some great scenes involving vampires and a train. I think the book is better but not a bad film adaptation. I rate this film 9/10.",9,1,2,14 January 2014
Who Framed Roger Rabbit," One of the Greatest Family Films of the 80's!
","When Who Framed Roger Rabbit was released in 1988, the film was a major breakthrough for the film industry. For the first time, human characters and cartoon characters were able to share the screen together and look real. Compared to today, the visuals may not seem impressive. But back then, this was unheard of and a risky move that paid off. As for the story, this film has a heart, is funny, full of one-liners, and is one the entire family can enjoy.Robert Zemeckis film is about how a toon-hating detective was hired to investigate an affair that Roger Rabbit's wife, Jessica was having with Marvin Acme. But after Acme was found dead, Roger was accused of murdering him. But after Roger pleas to the detective, he uncovers scandal after scandal.The acting is pretty good for the most part and I'm sure it was challenging to play these roles. Bob Hoskins does a wonderful job as the detective. But even better as the Judge was the menacing Christopher Lloyd. I think he managed to give every kid who saw this film nightmares for weeks.Overall, Who Framed Roger Rabbit is a break-through movie of the 80's and a family film that has a big heart. It was nice seeing some great cameos from the likes of Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck. If there is a film to bring back some childhood memories, this is the film to watch. A magnificent family film indeed. I rate this film 9/10.",9,2,2,17 June 2014
Minority Report," Spielberg: The Master of Cinema!
","This movie shows that one of the best directors ever in the movie business has not lost his touch after nearly four decades in the movie business. That director is none other than Steven Spielberg. He has not lost his touch with this movie.This film is set in the future, 2054 to be exact. John Anderton is the chief of Precrime, a crime division that can tell when murders happen before they happen all due to the Precogs, beings that have special powers. Once Anderton sees himself committing murder, he is on the run from his own division.The acting is very good. Tom Cruise did a fantastic job. Just as good was the great Colin Farrell and the legendary Max Von Sydow.John Williams is one of the better composers of the past century. He knows how to make music and it does not change with this movie. Wonderful score! Some reviewers compare this movie to Blade Runner-in a negative way. This movie is much better than Blade Runner.Overall, this is a great Sci-Fi film. I rate this movie 9/10.",9,1,2,4 April 2009
Finding Neverland," Better Than Expected!
","Finding Neverland is a really great, powerful family film that discusses the life of J.M Barrie and his inspiration for Peter Pan. I never thought much of this film in the past despite positive reviews and Academy recognition. But I should have because it's sweet, heart-warming, emotional, and a perfect example of a family film. I would have never thought that the director of this film, Marc Forster would go on to direct a James Bond film.Forster's film is about a failing playwright named J.M Barrie. He meets this family of a woman and her three kids as he is sitting in the park. He becomes great friends with this family and little did he know how this changed his life for the better and created a story so magical, that many children around the world cherish the beloved Peter Pan.Johnny Depp is really good in the film. This is a departure from his other roles of Jack Sparrow or Edward Scissorhands. He shows why he's better than people give him credit for. The guy knows how to act. Kate Winslet is really good as the mother and Julie Christie is great as the stern mother of Winslet. However, Freddie Highmore deserves the highest credit in his role of Peter.Overall, this is a very heartwarming story of a man who invented one of the most famous childhood figures of all time. I shouldn't have doubted this film but this is a true example of a biography. It's one of those rare ones that are safe for kids. I really loved this film and it will remain in my heart for years to come. I rate this film 10/10.",10,3,3,24 March 2013
Training Day," Denzel Is the Best!
","Training Day is Denzel's best film no question about it. He usually plays the good guys but not here. Even though his profession is supposed to be good, his character is far from good. This movie should have been nominated for Best Picture. It may have been one of the best films of 2001.This is about a rookie cop named Jake Hoyt and his dream is to be a narc so he can make his family's life better. He gets put into the supervision of veteran narc Alonzo. It turns out that Alonzo ain't like most cops.Denzel Washington deserved his Oscar. If anyone one else won it would have been an outrage. Ethan Hawke had a very convincing performance as well.Overall, Antoine Fuqua directed an action-packed thriller that is one of the best of 2001. I rate this film 10/10.",10,1,3,7 February 2011
In Bruges," Bloody Brilliant Film!
","In Bruges is a masterful dark comedy mixed with elements of an excellent crime thriller and together, those two genres created a cinematic gem. It seems like British films are increasingly getting better or I should say more abstract than Hollywood films. I'm not convinced that an American studio would make a film like this. This film has some sharp, witty dialog and it proves to be effective, especially during the bantering of Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleeson.Martin McDonagh's film is about two hit men who are sent to Bruges to cool things off after a failed hit attempt. But things go awry when the crime boss comes to town to settle things.The acting is very good. I think Colin Farrell is underrated but this film shows he has the makings to be a bona-fide star. His sharp turns and the way he gives his dialog is very memorable. He and Gleeson have absolutely one hundred percent chemistry with each other. Ralph Fiennes makes a great baddie as we know because of his role as Voldemort in the Harry Potter films. But, he's not entirely bad and I love to see that in a bad guy.Overall, this is a dark comedy that has a little bit of everything. It has thrilling moments, some action, comedy, a little bit of romance, and some blood. It also can be classified as a satire and a witty one too. It has a very memorable screenplay and is one of the best of 2008. I knew this would be a good film and I'm glad I was not disappointed. I rate this film 10/10.",10,0,4,19 July 2013
Friday Night Lights," Best Sports Movie Ever!
","Friday Night Lights definitely exceeded my expectations. I did not think much of this film because I thought it would be similar to Remember the Titans. This movie is nothing like that at all. When this movie was finished, I just sat there stunned on how great this movie is.This movie is based off the real life events that happened to one football team in Odessa, Texas in 1988. There is hype surrounding the team that the Panthers will win the state championship.The acting is very good. Billy Bob Thornton is a great coach with a different personality than the coach he played in Bad New Bears. The young cast featuring Lucas Black and Garrett Hedlund were excellent.Overall, this is the best sports movie ever made. I think it was snubbed at the Oscars. I rate this film 10/10.",10,0,0,13 January 2011
Kung Fu Panda," Movie filled with awesomeness!
","Kung-Fu Panda is much better than I expected it to be. When this movie first came out, I saw the trailer and thought to myself that this movies looks pathetic. I was reluctant at first to see this when it came out on DVD, but I got it for Christmas and I was wrong. I enjoyed it a lot.The plot is very simple. It's about a panda who wants to learn kung-fu to save his village from the evil Tai Lung who recently escaped from prison. But, he must be chosen as the new Dragon Warrior and endure the taunts from the Furious Five.This movie is full of amazing voice talents: Jack Black as Po, Dustin Hoffman as Shifu, Ian McShane as Tai Lung, Angelina Jolie as Tigress, and Jackie Chan as Monkey.The animation is very good. You can put this movie with Pixar because the animation is beautiful. The scenery is great to look at and this is an animated movie.This movie belongs in the top animated movies ever such as Shrek, Cars, Finding Nemo, and Toy Story. I rate this film 10/10.",10,1,2,8 January 2009
Chinatown," The Best Neo-Noir Film!
","This is a movie that pays great homage to the film-noir movies of the 30's and 40's. If this wasn't a color film with 1970's actors, I would have believed this film was made in 1940. This is certainly the best neo-noir film you could hope for. This is also the film that gave Jack Nicholson a long career in the movie business.This film is pretty much a private detective who thinks he is investigating with an adultery case. However, that is just the beginning of all the mystery that is yet to come.The acting is marvelous. I would expect great performances from the likes of Nicholson and Dunaway but their performances were just beyond greatness.Another thing that stands out is the original screenplay by Robert Towne. This screenplay is perhaps why this movie is one of the best films ever made.Overall, this is an Oscar-caliber film that is worth watching. Even if you're not a film buff, I would still check out this film. It's a bit long but you won't notice the time in Chinatown. I rate this film 9/10.",9,2,3,22 July 2012
Gravity," An Exhilarating Experience!
","I saw Gravity when it came out in theaters and I will never forget the spectacular feeling of awe I saw watching this film. The visuals are astounding and so lifelike. I recall Alfonso Cuaron saying he had to invent the technology and my gosh, Earth never looked so beautiful on the big screen. The sound design is also amazing and when we sync the sound with the visuals, we are in for a treat. The story, however, is merely average. It's not bad or anything, but it's nothing new. It does add a sense of realism and danger. This is a realistic space movie, so we cannot believe that three-legged aliens will come out of nowhere. Instead it is just about a mission that has gone wrong.Alfonso Cuaron's film is about two astronauts named Dr. Ryan Stone and Matt Kowalski who are stranded in space after their shuttle was destroyed in a collision with broken satellites. Now they must find a way back to Earth even if that means traveling across the globe.....in space.For the most part, this movie is a one-woman show. I think Sandra Bullock did a fine job in this role, much better than people give her credit for. George Clooney's screen time was not long, but he effectively countered Sandra Bullock. This is one of those survival movies that don't rely on a huge cast and it works better that way.Overall, Gravity is a very good movie, especially in regards to the technical design. That was beyond impressive and it made for quite an exhilarating ride at the theaters. I remember how me and the audience was blown away by Earth and space and the lack of sound in space. The story is a little thin or perhaps simplistic will be the better word to describe the story. But I did like some of the dialogue and the in-house jokes referencing a certain space movie from the mid-1990's. All things said, this is a solid directorial effort by Alfonso Cuaron. I rate this film 8/10.",8,2,4,17 December 2014
Lone Survivor," A Brutal and Modern Take on Warfare!
","Lone Survivor is an excellent movie and is one of the better war movies to be released this century. The movie has themes of survival and heroism as well as the Navy SEALS protecting their brother-in-arms at all costs, down to the final death. I liked the opening of the film where it shows a montage on just how tough training is and if you can complete training, you can do anything. The film also made me angry in regards to this failed mission. Communication was the key here and the movie made note that the army's communication systems may be faulty thus resulting in a failed mission. Peter Berg's film is about a mission, where four Navy SEALS led by Marcus Lutterel are tasked to capture or kill Taliban leader Ahmad Shah. However they are led into an ambush where the four men are pitted in the ultimate battle, on the precarious mountain ranges in Afghanistan, against the better-armed Taliban army. The film was well-acted as everyone got a piece of the puzzle. Mark Wahlberg was outstanding as the one of the leaders of the four men and he actually had a few tear-worthy scenes. Ben Foster had another standout performance as Axelson. Taylor Kitsch does a great job as Mike Murphy and under the bulk, Emile Hirsch likewise did a great job as Danny Dietz. Finally, Eric Bana is forever reliable as Commander Kristensen. Overall, Lone Survivor is a great war film and a powerful one at that. The movie focused mainly on the character development between the SEALS, so don't expect to get to really know any of the Taliban that well. The film has lots of action and because of the odds stacked against the SEALS, it made for a very tense watch. The movie is an unflinching, brutal take on warfare and is also very realistic. A sad, but an ultimately powerful film. I rate this film 9.5/10.",9,1,2,3 February 2015
Meet the Parents," Get Ready to Laugh!
","Meet the Parents is one of the funniest films this decade and it is not a spoof. I was laughing so hard, soda came bursting out of my nose. Robert De Niro and Ben Stiller did such an amazing job. I was not bored of this movie at all. Gaylord Focker and his girlfriend, Pam are set to become engaged. But to do so, they must travel to Pam's parents. It turns out that Pam's father, Jack is a CIA agent and dislikes Gaylord a lot. Gaylord did many hilarious things which includes losing a rare cat. The ironic thing is that Pam's sister got engaged and will be married....when and if Gaylord can get his act together. The acting is wonderful. You usually don't see De Niro doing movies like this. He did absolutely amazing. Ben Stiller did just as good. If you want to see this movie, get ready to laugh. This movie is full of laughs! I rate this movie 10/10.",10,26,35,23 November 2008
Se7en," David Fincher=Genius Director!
","Se7en is perhaps the greatest murder story ever told on cinema. This is the film that brought David Fincher into the spotlight. I expected a great movie from what I heard about this film, but nothing prepared me for this.This is about a killer who goes by the name of John Doe. His evil plan is to murder seven people associated with the seven deadly sins. A veteran detective teams up with a rookie detective to solve this heinous crime as it unfolds.I expected nothing less from Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt as the detectives. They are very talented actors. However, Kevin Spacey stole the show. He just creeped the living daylight out of me.Overall, this is a dark, but genius film! This is not for the weak-minded or for young children. Also, the ending for this film has to be the best ending ever in the history of film. I rate this film 10/10.",10,0,1,11 May 2012
Wayne's World," Better than I thought!
","When I first saw this movie, I thought the two main characters would give me a splitting headache. They seemed like the types who would. But since nothing else was on, I decided to take the risk. I was pleasantly surprised they way the film turned out. It's not the best movie ever, but I had a fun time.This film is about two guys who run a TV show called 'Wayne's World.' Thats pretty much the plot.The acting is pretty good. Mike Myers had a solid film debut. Tia Carrere spices up a few things in the movie. And I was happy to see Chris Farley.Overall, this is a good movie with some funny gags. I rate this film 7/10.",7,1,1,8 June 2011
The Big Lebowski," A Letdown!
","After reading all the reviews and seeing how much people liked this cult classic, I was all ready to watch this and have a good time. By the end of the film, I had to change my judgement. I did have a good time, but I was disappointed that I did not love this. There are some fun, quirky moments but this movie was too strange for my taste.This is about a guy named 'The Dude' who is trying to investigate a case of his missing carpet and missing money.Jeff Bridges is a great actor, but I he was a little annoying in the movie as 'The Dude.' However, John Goodman had a classic performance as The Dude's best friend.Overall, this is a decent at best film. It has some funny moments but not enough to justify the high rating this film got. I thought it was something of a letdown. At least I finally saw a movie that depicted bowling. I rate this film 6/10.",6,2,5,21 May 2012
Unbreakable," Quiet, Suspenseful Thriller!
","It's hard to believe, but ten years ago M. Night Shymalan was actually a really good director with a knack of thrilling audiences with Signs, The Sixth Sense, and this movie Unbreakable. I found this movie to be the weaker of the three in part of a unsatisfactory ending but the build up to the third act is great and right on par with the Sixth Sense and Signs.This film is about a security guard who is the only survivor of a train crash. Soon afterwords, he meets this mysterious stranger who happens to be a comic book collector and a big believer of related human traits and events between comic books and reality. After this meeting, no one's lives will be the same again.For a movie like this, they only needed two brand-name actors and they happened to be Bruce Willis and Samuel L. Jackson. Bruce Willis had a toned-down performance which is quite unlike him but I liked his sense of caution and quietness. Samuel L. Jackson simply reminded me of some of his other roles and that's a good thing because I respect him a lot.Overall, this is a tense thriller especially with the first two-thirds of the movie. The last act is good on paper and was okay executed on screen but I felt it could have been much more. I didn't feel the emotion I felt in the other two films I mentioned. It's a shame that M. Night Shymalan has lost his value over the years, but Unbreakable is one of his good ones. I rate this film 8/10.",8,1,1,18 March 2013
Star Trek," Wow!
","This Star Trek movie really has got me thinking of turning into a Trekkie. I never have been interested in Star Trek before but I am seriously considering changing my mind. This film was amazing with great acting, amazing special effects, and a great script.This movie basically tells the origins of the Star Trek characters. We get to see how James T. Kirk becomes captain and we get to see the rise of Spock as well.The acting is perfect. There are many great names here. The best ones were the newcomers in Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto. I was really pleased to see Leonard Nimoy make a cameo.Overall, this is a fantastic science fiction movie. I am happily awaiting the second movie. 'Live long and prosper!' I rate this movie 10/10.",10,3,9,10 December 2010
Fight Club," Way Overrated!
","I had high expectations about this film. Sice everyone recommended this movie to me, I decided to buy it. This is a good movie in all, but I was disappointed. A movie with Brad Pitt and Edward Norton should be one of the best movies in the world. This film is just not the case.The plot is very complex. It's about a dude who has a strange way of looking at life and the overall picture. He joins support groups that doesn't even have to do with him. Then he meets Tyler. Tyler decides to start Fight Club and bring it to the next level.Well, the acting is phenomenal. The only part of the movie that is. Brad Pitt and Edward Norton had great chemistry and brought life to this movie.I will also give in to the fact that there are some surprising twists that will amaze viewers.Helena Bonham Carter's character does not belong in this movie. All she does is chain smoke and talk about sex.I also wish for more fight scenes. There is hardly any fighting scenes in the film.Overall, this movie deserves less than what I say. But, other people liked it and I agree it had potential. Give this film a look and see what you think. I rate this film 7/10.",7,0,5,5 May 2009
As Good as It Gets," Compelling Performance by Jack Nicholson!
","As romantic comedies go, As Good as It Gets is near the top tier. It's funny, sweet, and compelling all at the same time, and these are the kind of films which allow me to enjoy the rom-com. This film is not perfect as some scenes drag on and it is a bit on the long side, but it's well-acted and the characters are a big strong point for the film itself thanks to the endearing performances by Jack Nicholson, Helen Hunt, and Greg Kinnear.James L. Brooks film tells the story of what happens when an elderly romance author, a Manhattan waitress, and a gay artist come together on a road trip from New York City to Baltimore. It's an unlikely friendship that blossoms between the three.The acting is incredible. Jack Nicholson deserves his Oscar for his excellent, over-the-top acting. I have never big a big fan of Helen Hunt, but she gives an excellent performance here as the waitress who is trying to provide for her always-sick son. Also, Greg Kinnear was excellent as Jack's neighbor and I liked how he doesn't give an over-the-top performance to prove that his character is gay.Overall, As Good as It Gets is a pleasurable romantic comedy that is sweet and endearing. I can only really enjoy the very good rom coms and this is one of those. With a little more editing, this film could have been perfect. But thanks to the compelling performances of the three leads, this film is near perfection. It shows that anyone can love if you put your heart to it. I rate this film 9/10.",9,1,1,19 September 2014
The Rookie," Heart-Warming Sports Movie!
","The Rookie is actually a better movie than I thought it would be. It's heart-warming and just a perfect family film. Yes, it may be overly-clichéd but because of the top-notch performances and the theme of an old-timer realizing his dreams, we can't but help enjoy this film. It also ranks up with one of the best baseball films I have ever seen.John Lee Hancock's film is about a guy named Jim Morris who was a highly-touted baseball prospect but he was always injured. Years later, he is a chemistry teacher and baseball coach in Texas when he realizes he still may have some pitches left in him. Because of that, he begins to realize he may pitch in the majors after all.The acting is very good. Dennis Quaid brings earnesty and hope to his character and we see why Dennis Quaid is one of the nicest guys in film business. Brian Cox has a nice supporting turn as his stern, disapproving father.Overall, this is a very good film thanks to some high quality performances and a wonderful script. This is an excellent sports film and an even better baseball film. I have to point out this film is not just about baseball, but about some guy making his dreams come true after he thought all is done. I rate this film 9/10.",9,1,1,10 September 2013
Memento," Prepare To Have Your Mind Twisted!
","Even back in his early movies like Memento, the great Christopher Nolan proves what an intelligent filmmaker he is. It would usually take years of experience for most directors to create a film like this. I compare this film to another one of his that came out ten years later and that is Inception. They both have the same goal: to get the audience to think. Memento will surely get one to think. That is why this is a brilliant movie.This film has a very complex plot. It's about a guy who has no short-term memory so he writes notes all over his body. Quite simply, that guy is looking for the person who killed his wife and took away his memory.The acting is really good. Guy Pearce is such an underrated actor. He should get more credit with the Academy. Also, Carrie-Ann Moss and Joe Pantoliano gave great performances.Overall, this is one of the best mystery films out there. This movie also has a rarity. It's filmed backwards which I very rarely see in the movies. This movie also jumpstarted Christoper Nolan's career. I only rate this movie an 8/10 because it gave me such a headache watching this film from thinking too much.",8,0,2,24 May 2012
Inglourious Basterds," Great But Overrated!
","Don't get me wrong here but this is movie is definitely overrated. I liked this film a lot but I was let down in a way. From the reviews I read, I was expecting this film to be a 10/10 movie. Maybe the acting is, but not the movie itself. Also, I can't compare this to other Tarantino movies because I haven't seen any of his other works.This film is about a group of people who are bent on getting rid of the Nazis but they go about their business in a violent way. Now they have a plot in which they plan to kill all the big time officers all together.The acting is the best thing about the movie. I never heard of Christoph Waltz before this film and now I heard a lot about him. He deserved his Oscar. It seemed like Brad Pitt did not have enough screen time. I wanted more of him.I also wanted more action in this movie. It seemed like the majority of the film consisted of people talking at a table. But the action that was there was brutal and gory just the way I like it. Overall, this is great but overrated. I rate this film 8/10.",8,0,5,22 June 2010
Underworld," Enjoyable!
","Underworld is a pretty good movie. I had my doubts about it at first but I decided to give it a shot. I saw this only mere weeks after I saw the Twilight films so I was expecting the same. Well, this movie is so much different. There is so much violence and action here. The love story appears to be the back story.This takes place during a centuries old war between Lycans which are werewolves and vampires. This movie tells a love story between a vampire Selene and a hybrid in Michael.The acting is pretty good. Kate Beckinsale in a leather suit is definitely good to look at. Bill Nighy is a formidable screen presence as the vampire elder. I also have to say the same for Michael Sheen.Overall, this is a good movie to watch. If you like stories about vampires and werewolves, this is for you. I rate this film 8/10.",8,1,2,26 February 2011
Amistad," Such a Potent History Lesson!
","Amistad is a surprisingly great movie that is a welcome addition into the filmography of Steven Spielberg. It has some courtroom clichés and some typical Spielberg drama fluff, but it overcomes those minor obstacles to be a powerful, sometimes-disturbing film about a group of people who yearn for their freedom. The editing is also choppy and sometimes it is hard to pick up what's going on, but this story moved me so much, I didn't care if the editing was sub-par.Amistad, based on a true story, is about a group of African slaves who attempt to escape from their captors, but they are recaptured and sent to America for trial. Now these blacks will have to endure unfairness and racial hatred to find out their fates.The acting is powerful. This is the movie where Djimon Hounsou becomes a star and this movie shows why. His performance as the so-called 'alpha male' nearly moved me to tears. Anthony Hopkins, who played John Quincy Adams, delivers one of the best speeches you'll ever hear in the movies. Matthew McConaughey, in one of his early non-romantic roles does a wonderful job. I really love Morgan Freeman, but I'm disappointed he didn't do much in the film.Overall, this is a powerhouse film that shows expert Spielberg direction and wonderful acting. The editing is questionable, but I'll let it slide for a film like this. I honestly didn't expect this to be good as it was so I'm quite happy. I rate this film 9/10.",9,0,3,1 July 2013
Coraline," Very Good Animation!
","I thought that Coraline would be one of those stupid animated movies that comes out once in awhile. It took me some time to get myself to be able to see it. I'm glad I did. This is a wonderful, imaginative story behind the director of Nightmare Before Christmas. This movie has a very dark tone, definitely Anti-Wall E.The story is about a girl named Coraline. She just moved with her family and is bored with her life. After exploring the house she discovers a portal that enables her to be with the 'Other' Mother. But is this mother any good? The movie is full of visual effects. That's the most stunning part about this movie. There is one thing I have to criticize. This movie should be rated PG-13. Coraline is way too scary for little kids. But, I'm glad I saw this. I rate this film 9/10.",9,2,3,28 March 2010
This Is the End," We Need More Comedies Like This!
","Now I've been hearing people compare this film to a Friedberg or Seltzer movie, but while the humor is the same, the style is vastly different. Now this film, This is the End is really funny and this is what I'd call a 'smart' parody film. It pokes fun at a lot of many different things, but not in a way you'd see in Disaster Movie or Epic Movie. This film is gleefully offensive and sacrilegious, but that's how I like it. I think it was smart to pretend this was real life and have all the actors play themselves, because it added a touch of realism.Seth Rogen's and Evan Goldberg's directorial effort is about how a bunch of famous celebrities deal with the Rapture and survive encounters with demons and even the Devil himself.If you like each actor and think they're funny, then you won't be disappointed here. They all do a wonderful job from the back-stabbing James Franco to the stupid jerk Danny McBride to the serial killer-like Jonah Hill to the weed-loving Seth Rogen and to the people-hating Jay Baruchel. There were some awesome cameos and I won't spoil anything, but Michael Cera and Channing Tatum had the best ones hand down.Overall, This is the End is a hard R-rated comedy that is something I haven't seen before. It's really funny, especially during the first half. This film also makes good use of special effects, as you'll aptly see in the second half. As a fan of 90's music, I was thrilled to see the final scene and I think you will be as well. A great, cameo-filled comedy. I rate this film 9/10.",9,1,6,20 September 2014
Dawn of the Dead," Effectively Scary!
","I'm not a fan of horror movies at all and I do my best to avoid them, but with zombies being the rage these days, I guess it was time for me to check this film out. It's a remake of the 1978 George Romero classic that I have yet to see, but as a stand-alone film, it's an effective scary film. It delivers the thrills, chills, and plenty of gore and blood.This is the feature film debut of Zach Snyder and it's an impressive debut. It's about how this mysterious virus spread by human bites that kill humans and turn their bodies into the living dead after they die. A group of survivors head to a mall and there they fight with all they got against these flesh-eating monsters.The acting is pretty good. I hear from other people that the acting is better than the original. Unlike most horror films, you get to care for the main characters and feel sympathy towards them. Sarah Polley is pretty good in the lead. Ving Rhames is very good as the hard-nosed cop and I liked Michael Kelly as the slimeball mall guard who goes through a change in personality over the course of the film.Overall, this is all you can want in a horror film. It has good chills and the creature designs are excellent. The makeup is effectively scary. This is most likely the movie that started the zombie rage that is currently taking place. It's a fine horror movie, but nothing more than that. I was pleasantly surprised. I rate this film 8/10.",8,0,0,16 July 2013
Iron Man 2," Possibly Better than Original!
","I went in the theaters with an open mind ready to expect the best and that is what I got. Iron Man 2 is just as good maybe even better than the first one. Robert Downey Jr is superb as Tony Stark once again. I also loved the performance by Mickey Rourke as Whiplash. I didn't expect much out of him. And of course we all know why Scarlett Johansson is here.This movie takes place right after Stark becomes public. He has to deal with the government who wants to take his suit and Whiplash who wants to kill him because of his father, Howard.I loved everything here. I enjoyed the action, the chicks, the cars, the special effects, and much more. The only thing I really hated was that Don Cheadle replaced Terrence Howard. I love Cheadle's acting but Howard was perfect in the first one.Overall, this is a fantastic sequel. I hope they make Iron man 3 and I can't wait until the Avengers in two years. I rate this film 10/10.",10,17,34,30 September 2010
Alien: Resurrection," The Worst Alien Movie but...
","I still kind of liked it. I didn't like it as much as the predecessors though. Alien and Aliens were two excellent, genre-defining movies. Alien 3 is much better than people give it credit for. I can see why people despise this movie. The beginning of the movie is very slow. But from the halfway point, I thoroughly enjoyed the movie.Ripley returns two hundred years later as a clone...and an alien inside her. Along with a group of mercenaries, Ripley has to save the day again.The acting is pretty good. I enjoyed another great performance by Signourey Weaver. Winona Ryder does a decent job as Call. I like Ron Perlman even though he seems to be in every terrible movie.I thought the final alien shown is a great design. That thing is very ugly. I knew what the other aliens were gonna look like though.Overall, this is a good movie but nothing more. If you really wanna see a great alien movie, check out the first three. I rate this film 6/10.",6,1,1,19 August 2011
World War Z," Very Exciting Zombie Film!
","Nowadays, zombies are the craze in the entertainment industry. Earlier in 2013, we had Warm Bodies and there have also been television shows focusing on the undead, such as the fantastic TV series, the Walking Dead. I dreaded this movie because like any other Internet user, I paid attention to the production problems this film encountered. It is much better than I thought and is action-packed and even though it's relatively bloodless, we have ourselves a giant action spectacle. While we associate zombies with being slow, this film had them moving at high speeds and I think that was a neat twist in the tiring zombie genre.Marc Forster's film is about a U.N specialist named Gerry Lane who survives the original zombie pandemic along with his family. Now that he is safe, he must go on a race against time to find a cure and keep his family safe.The acting in the film is actually really good. But that's not surprising with Brad Pitt in the lead who constantly proves that he is a diverse actor. While a tad short on character development, Brad Pitt certainly leads the way as he finds himself in the midst of all the action.Overall, World War Z is a rather different take on zombies and the film feels fresher that way. It's a bit uneven at times, but there is just way too many things to like about this film. The special effects are really good and though some people question them, I think it takes some time to get used to, especially with me being a Walking Dead fanatic. Despite the troubled production, this film is highly entertaining and I hope there is a sequel down the line. I rate this film 9/10.",9,2,3,28 September 2014
Forgetting Sarah Marshall," Another Hilarious Apatow Production!
","Forgetting Sarah Marshall is another absolutely hilarious film produced by the great Judd Apatow. Despite plenty of sex jokes, this film has a heart in the middle. I love comedies that have a heart because that is what makes them so good and watchable.This is about a guy who breaks up with his actress girlfriend. In order to deal with his heartbreak, he takes a vacation to Hawaii so he can once again have a good time.The acting is really good. The cast led by Jason Segel, Kristen Bell, Mila Kunis, and Russell Brand proved that they have great chemistry together. I thought Brand was especially hilarious in this film.Overall, this was a funny, heart-warming(at times) film. Whenever Apatow directs or produces a movie, you know it will be great. I rate this film 9/10.",9,0,2,27 June 2012
The Hunger Games," Can't Get Better Than This!
","The Hunger Games, based off the wildly popular novel by Suzanne Collins, is a spectacular movie and a very good adaptation of the book. The film effectively manages to take the raw emotion of the book and transfer it to screen. This film makes you care about the characters and it gives you insight on some dystopian politics. This film has some good action scenes and some intense survival scenes, but I feel like this film is carried by the raw emotional power and the great acting.Gary Ross's film takes place in the country of Panem. There are 12 districts and every year each district has 2 young people who participate in the hunger games which involves one victor and everyone else dead. For this game, Katniss Everdeen volunteers in place of her sister and along with District 12 other player Peeta, they both go these violent games in the Capital and try to survive these games! The acting is nothing short of brilliant. Jennifer Lawrence is a young, talented actress who has a very broad emotional range. Stanley Tucci and Woody Harrelson are also nothing short of magnificent. Wes Bentley and Donald Sutherland are also good in their roles. Finally, Elizabeth Banks probably has the best wardrobe I have seen in recent films.Overall, this is a fantastic adaptation of the original source novel. In many ways, this film improves on the novel. In the novel, I was not fond of Katniss's thinking. But luckily we did not have to deal with that here. Movie-wise, I was not fond of the shaky camera but thankfully it didn't take anything away from the film. I rate this film 10/10.",10,0,5,19 November 2013
12 Monkeys," Very Good Science Fiction!
","Twelve Monkeys is a very good science fiction film in part because it has a visionary director at the helm who doesn't believe in following the rules of cinema which of course is Terry Gilliam and also it has a very good portrayal of time travel which is kind of different they way it's used in this film. Despite some good, clever action scenes, this is not a straight-up action film. Instead, it's more of a thriller that likes to challenge viewers and that it does successfully. It helps that there are a few mind-blowing twists and turns thrown in.This film is about a jailed guy, James Cole who is sent back in time to prevent a virus that wipe out the majority of the human population by 1997. He meets a psychologist and together, they try to find the 12 Monkeys cult which is believed to be the ones that let the virus out.The acting is really good. Bruce Willis and especially Brad Pitt are on top of their games in the movie. Brad Pitt really gives it his all by playing a mental person with a weird imagination. Bruce Willis is really good as the guy who just wants to do his job and leave. Madeleine Stowe also does a good job even though I thought she was confusing at times.Overall, this is a very good film both as a narrative and a technical display. Both worlds, past and future, are depicted as grim and dirty. It must have influenced 2006's Children of Men, because that is what the bleak landscape reminded me of. This thriller reminds me of the old Hitchcock films and the early Shymalan films with the kind of plot twists the movie has. This is a really sci-fi film and it holds up well. I rate this film 9/10.",9,6,8,14 March 2013
Mississippi Burning," A Gripping, Tense Story!
","Mississippi Burning takes place during a harrowing time for the United States and more specifically, the black people. In 1964, America was in the midst of the civil rights movement and in the South, racism was prevalent and tensions between both the whites and blacks were through the roof. This film does an excellent job on telling a story that depicts this and as a result, we get a film that's moving, touching, and even courageous.Alan Parker's film is about how two radically different FBI agents team together to solve the case of the three missing civil rights workers whom the authorities believe the Ku Klux Klan have a part in the disappearance.The acting is excellent thanks to the lead performances by Gene Hackman and Willem Dafoe. Hackman, good as always, delivers an excellent 'deceptively calm' performance. On the other hand, Dafoe plays by the book and does a great job. Frances McDormand delivers a powerhouse as well as she is the clue to exactly what happened to these three men.Overall, Mississippi Burning is an excellent, but very moving film as it tells a harrowing story. The white Southerners are depicted as evil in the film, but in reality they may have well been evil. They refused the blacks their natural rights and as a result, these sort of things happened. This is a great thriller and it's one that should keep you on your toes. I rate this film 9/10.",9,2,2,20 June 2014
The Impossible," Gut-Wrenching, Emotional Film!
","The Impossible is one of the best films of 2012 and one that will stick with me for the ages. It's a powerhouse when it comes to acting and the story itself. The screenplay is not the greatest, but it does work for the most part. This is based off one of the most horrific natural disasters in world history and I won't be ashamed to say that my eyes were often moist during the film.J.A Bayona directs a film based one family's account of the 2004 tsunami in Thailand. With Maria, her husband, and he three sons separated from each other, we see how they struggle to survive as they try to find each other.The acting is terrific especially by Naomi Watts and Ewan McGregor. Watts best scenes were in the beginning but she deserves her Oscar nomination. McGregor has many powerful scenes as well. It's safe to say that both give their best performances of their career. I also must give a special mention to Tom Holland because it choked up during the scenes when he becomes the caretaker and the protector of his mother during most of the film.Overall, this is one incredible film about how one family achieved the impossible. It's powerful and often very shocking. I remember this event clearly and it's one that I can never forget. The VFX was great as they recreated the deadly wave that killed many, many people. I felt like it was the actual wave, so the special effects team did a great job. Other than a so-so script, this is one of the best films of 2012. I rate this film 9/10.",9,0,1,28 May 2014
42," Inspirational Film!
","42 is the inspirational tale of Jackie Robinson and how he made history in the great game of baseball by becoming the first colored man to play ball in the Major League. But this film goes beyond Jackie, it talks about the color barrier and how racism was prevalent everywhere those days. This is a story about how a special group of people rose to the challenge to overcome racism. This was a very moving film, perhaps a little too sentimental to a fault. But as biopics go, this is one of the better ones.Brian Helgeland's film is about none other than number 42, Jackie Robinson. The Dodgers owner, Branch Rickey has come up with a risky idea and that is to break the color barrier and he chooses Jackie. But Jackie doesn't stand down to racism, and if he wants to play in the bigs, instead of fighting racism with words and fights, he fights it with baseball.The acting is tremendous. Chadwick Boseman came out of nowhere it seems to take the lead role and he was amazing. I felt like I was actually watching the legendary Jackie Robinson. Harrison Ford as Branch Rickey likewise was amazing and Harrison's trademark gruffiness was perfect for this role. I also must mention Alan Tudyk as the racist Phillies manager. Obviously, it's nothing to celebrate but his role is how people acted back then and he perfectly captured that.Overall, 42 is an excellent biopic that tells all the hardships Jackie Robinson had to endure on his way to greatness. Jackie being here paved the way for future foreign players and showed baseball that it was not an all-white male sport. This is an excellent, though a bit too sentimental tribute to one of the greatest heroes of all time, Jackie Robinson. I rate this film 9/10.",9,1,3,6 August 2014
Shaun of the Dead," Hilarious!
","Shaun of the Dead is a movie that would please both comedy and horror fans. This film had me laughing my brains for the duration of the film. There were also some creepy moments as well. This movie is the first movie in the trilogy starring Simon Pegg and Nick Frost. This is the way to start off a comedy trilogy.This film is pretty much about some guy, his best friend, his family, and his girlfriend trying to avoid zombies.Simon Pegg and Nick Frost have great chemistry. They were totally hilarious! I was surprised to see Bill Nighy. He also delivered the goods in the film.Overall, this is a hilarious 'horror' film. But be forewarned, most Americans will be surprised at the British humor in the film. But, I'm sure they will get used to it. I rate this film 9/10.",9,2,5,25 May 2012
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," Great Sequel!
","The second installment in the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise is surprisingly great. Of course, the first film is better but this is not too far behind. The CGI is amazing. I loved the effects of Davy Jones and the sea monster. It's always a pleasure watching Captain Jack be the person he is.Jack Sparrow learns he has a blood debt to pay to Davy Jones. He must steal Jone's heart or he will spend a lifetime in servitude. Meanwhile, Will and Elizabeth are arrested and are due to hang unless they can get the help of Jack.The characters/acting is good as the original especially Johnny Depp. I liked the new characters especially Davy Jones. There is even a nice surprise at the end.Overall, this is another great pirates movie. This may be a little long. I rate this film 9/10.",9,1,3,14 July 2010
Argo," Brilliant Movie!
","Here is a movie that is in deserving of it's Best Picture trophy and this movie is of course, Argo. This is not entirely historically accurate, but this film made me want to learn more about the Iran Hostage Crisis. Cinematically, this thriller is about as perfect you're going to get. The acting and the directing are very good and Affleck is maturing as a director. As technical things go, the editing is great and it features a beautiful score by Alexandre Desplat.Affleck's third directorial effort may as well be his best one. He directs a story based on the real events in Iran. The American embassy in Iran has been taken over by Iranians and hostages have been taken except for six of those who escaped. The CIA has assigned Tony Mendez to head to Iran under the guise of a filmmaker who is on a location scout for his new film, Argo.This film only have four big names and they all do well. Ben Affleck is strong as Mendez and this is one of his better acting roles. Bryan Cranston seems to be in everything these days and does well as Mendez's superior. Alan Arkin is excellent and he has the film's best quote. John Goodman also does a solid job.Overall, Argo is the best movie of 2012 and that's saying something. All the ingredients come together to serve a tense, emotional thriller that keeps you on your toes. The film does a great job building up tense and telling the story for the first half before the second half unleashes the tension and action. Ben Affleck has proved himself as one of the best directors out there with 'Gone Baby Gone,' 'The Town,' and now this film. Not a historically accurate movie, but it doesn't need to be. I rate this film 10/10.",10,0,4,29 March 2014
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," Fantastic Pirate Movie!
","This movie is the opening to a very good franchise though this is the best one of the series yet(I heard really good things about #4). The only other pirate movie I saw before this was Hook. Hook should not even be compared to this. Sorry, Mr. Spielberg! Johnny Depp, in my opinion, turned Jack Sparrow into the Top Ten list of all-time acting. Savvy? Elizabeth Swann, daughter of a governor, was kidnapped by a host of feisty pirates. Now her lover Will Turner join forces with Jack Sparrow who used to be with those pirates to rescue Swann.This movie has a little of everything here. There's plenty of action, adventure, comedy, and romance. I didn't want to see this movie when it first came out, but I was forced to. I'm glad I did. I rate this movie 10/10.",10,0,1,13 July 2010
Star Trek Into Darkness," Fantastic Sequel to a Fantastic Reboot!
","When the reboot of Star Trek was released in 2009, I was one of the many who heralded the film. Not being interested in the series at all, I was turned into a fan. Now the sequel has arrived and I went it thinking the director J.J Abrams would not be able to outdo himself. Boy was I ever wrong. Star Trek Into Darkness once again excels by acting as a true sci-fi film that is bound together to the core by the early Star Trek fundamentals, but is action-packed and visually stunning enough to satisfy non-Trekkies and the average movie-goer.Abrams's return to the U.S.S Enterprise is a very successful one as it takes place one year after the events of the reboot. After a terrorist attack by the mysterious John Harrison, Kirk, Spock, and the rest of the crew embark on a mission to the Klingon world in order to return Harrison to Earth. But this mission may dig deeper than everyone would have thought.Most of the cast returns to this film and they are excellent as always. Chris Pine really matures as Kirk, but he is able to maintain his lovable goofball personality. Zachary Quinto is excellent as Spock, who never seems to lighten up. Pine and Quinto show fantastic chemistry and they even have a scene together that touched my heart. Benedict Cumberbatch makes one hell of a villain mainly not because he is menacing, but we can feel some sympathy towards him. The rest of the cast featuring Zoe Saldana, Bruce Greenwood, Simon Pegg, and Karl Urban were very good and truly supplemented the main characters.Overall, Star Trek Into Darkness is one of the rare sequels that is better than the original. It has a slightly darker tone, but that doesn't stop the film from offering up a few jokes from time to time. The action is spectacular and so are the visuals and the production design. The world they were in at the beginning is just a tiny example of the technical mastery of the film. While staying true to the deeper meanings of Star Trek, Abrams created a product that enlightens Trekkies and non-Trekkies alike. I rate this film 10/10.",10,2,6,11 September 2014
Stripes," Had a Fun Time!
","I had a really fun time watching this clever Bill Murray film. It did not win awards, but this film is not meant to. It is just a fun film that pokes fun at the Army and where you can laugh until your side hurts too much.This is about John Winger who decides to join the military because he feels like he has nothing more to do with his current lifestyle. He drags his friend to join the military and they plan to show the military what it is like to have a good time.When this film was released in 1981, the cast was unknown with the exception of Bill Murray. Murray is really funny in this movie and this would be film that led him and Harold Ramis to be together in Ghostbusters. The whole cast was just great especially the late Warren Oates as the drill sergeant.Overall, this film met my expectations. I was expecting to have a fun time with his film and I did. I rate this film 8/10.",8,0,0,28 April 2012
12 Angry Men," Keeps You On the Edge Of Your Sheet!
","This film, 12 Angry Men is famous for it's use of only one interior location for the duration of a film. It's a hard challenge to make a good film in only one location, but it works for this film. It's also known for it's disappointing box office and the critical acclaim it has received. Personally, I enjoyed the film because it does a great job building tension as the film progresses and it makes you what will happen next. It doesn't need action or explosions to old your attention, it has the proper characterization to hold your attention.Sidney Lumet's film is a courtroom drama on the outside, but on the inside it's more about a debate amongst jurors on reasonable doubt on a case about a kid who supposedly murdered his father.This film requires great acting and that it has plenty of. With only one bankable star in Henry Fonda, the cast manages to pull this off. Each character has their own unique identity and each identity is prevalent here. Their emotions are essential to how this film leads up to it's big ending.Overall, this is a great film and a great character study. It's a film that people in film school should be required to watch. It's all about the little things here since each of them count. We don't know anybody names, but we come to get to know these characters. It's as if we are there in person watching all this unfold. A great film indeed. I rate this film 9/10.",9,1,2,11 March 2014
The English Patient," Bold, Masterful Epic!
","The English Patient is a tale of doomed love and one that brings Lawrence of Arabia and Doctor Zhivago to mind. Director Anthony Mingella must have drawn inspiration from David Lean because there are so many Lean-like features in the film including an exact eye for detail. This is a sweeping and ambitious film that any lover of film will enjoy. It may be a tad too long and perhaps saccharine at certain points, but this film screams epic at you.Minghella's film starts off during the end of World War Two and after a plane crashes, this nurse named Hana cares for the mortally wounded Count Almasy who tells his story. While in Egypt, he falls in love with this woman named Katharine Clifton who is not happy with her husband. These two begin an affair which may lead to some harsh consequences.This film is well-acted and has some career-best performances worth of many accolades. Ralph Fiennes is essentially playing two people in one body and while not a career-best, it ranks up there in his top-five performances. Juliette Binoche is very good as Hana whom the war has taken a toll on. Kristen Scott Thomas does a good job at seducing the Count. Also, I must mention Willem Dafoe because he does a good job as the guy who is out to seek revenge against the Count.Overall, The English Patient is an ambitious project that is just a step away from perfection. I thought at times the romance wasn't as credible and seemed a little fake. But other than that, this film soars high. it has many stunning sequences, including the sandstorm scene. A very masterful film both technically and story-wise. A very David Lean-like film and that is a compliment. I rate this film 9/10.",9,1,2,27 March 2014
"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"," Absolutely Amazing!
","I saw this movie about a week after Christmas 2005 in a theater. I must say that I am very glad I did. This is one of the best movies ever! This movie is adapted from the C.S Lewis book. The story tells a wonderful, but dark story of four kids who are sent away to live with a professor while London is being bombed by the Germans. There, the youngest child, Lucy finds a wardrobe and she discovers a magical land-Narnia. No one believes her until the family were forced to hide in the cupboard. Once they are in Narnia, they must defeat the evil White Witch with the help of Aslan the lion and all of the good creatures. This film is about close as the book as it could be. Adamson did a very good job directing. The kids were great and had very good chemistry. I liked the bond of the family. The CGI Animation was good as well. The talking beavers and Aslan looked very real and believable. The score for this film was good as it should be. It's very moody and unpredictable, which is a good thing. I recommend to not only Christians, but for everybody. I rate this film a 10/10.",10,2,3,22 December 2007
"Crazy, Stupid, Love"," Sweet and Enjoyable!
","I am starting to become a bigger fan of rom coms precisely because of movies such as Crazy, Stupid, Love. This movie despite some normal clichés we see in rom coms has a heart and is just too sweet to pass on. After you get to know all the characters in the film, you really root for them. They all have good intentions even if they don't make the right choices.Glenn Requa and John Ficarra's film is about a guy, who after being married for 25 years, is asked for a divorce by his wife. Suddenly being free, he tries to move on but is unsuccessful. Suddenly he meets a younger guy who is about to teach him all he needs to know about women. But will that get him over his wife? The cast is a really good one. Steve Carell plays another sweet, likable guy. He is starting to grow on me as an actor instead of just a comedian. Julianne Moore as always delivers a strong performance as well as Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone. I also liked the subplot that involved the two teenagers.Overall, this is a very good film that rises above the other romantic comedies made recently just because it's so memorable and has strong, good-hearted characters. I also liked the fact that the funny moments and there were many, didn't come from any raucousness. If romantic comedies are getting made like this, they may have a brighter future. But, unfortunately these kind of above-average rom-coms are very rare. I'm glad I got to check out this gem. I rate this film 9/10.",9,0,1,10 March 2013
Happy Gilmore," Hilarious!
","Happy Gilmore and Billy Madison were the two movies that launched Adam Sandler's impressive career. They both were equally impressive movies but I am going to focus on Happy Gilmore of course. This movie is a great mixture of comedy and sport. Even though I despise golf greatly, I had a blast watching this film.This film is about Happy Gilmore, a guy with serious anger issues. he enlists in the Pro Golf Tour to win money so his grandmother can move back in her house that was taken away by the IRS.I though Adam Sandler was great here so screw that Razzie nomination. I think he is funny in every movie that he's supposed to be funny. I loved the cameos by Bob Barker and Ben Stiller. That made this movie even better.Overall, this movie is hilarious and one that I would watch over and over again. I rate this film 9/10.",9,1,2,1 November 2010
The Notebook," Perhaps the Greatest Love Story of Our Generation!
","As a guy, I generally try to stay away from Nicholas Sparks movies because they seem too schmaltzy and tripe for my taste. I do have a sweet spot for romance, but just not in these kind of films. Then I was forced to watch this film, The Notebook. I'm glad I did because this is the greatest love story of my generation perhaps only rivaling Titanic (please don't judge me.) This period piece also features memorable characters whom truly draw you in and I also mention this has one of the greatest film endings in cinema history and one that made the film even more remarkable. There are some clichés to be had, but in the end the film is just a simple love story.This film starts off in modern day at a nursing home with this elderly man named Duke reading a romance story to a female patient. This story is about how a working class man named Noah who falls in love with a girl named Allie, a girl from the elite class. Despite their social differences, they spend every day together. But they end up separating anyhow because of their different statuses. But seven years later, fate has them meeting up again but this time under different scenarios.This film is well-acted by everyone. Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams make a magnificent pair together on-screen and this movie is responsible for their stardom. There are good supporting turns by Sam Shepard as Noah's supportive father and Joan Allen as Allie's cold, stern mother. But we cannot miss the performances of the great James Garner as Duke and Gena Rowland as the female patient.Overall, Nick Cassevete directed a magnificent romance film and from what I heard, the best book-to-screen adaptation of Nicholas Sparks. This film is also realistic as it effectively shows what history was like and how social interactions changed over the past seventy years. I may have to check out more Sparks films, but I'm sure they are not even close to living up to the Notebook. And yes, I nearly cried at certain points. I rate this film 9/10.",9,2,4,17 October 2014
Public Enemies," Great Depiction of John Dillinger!
","I had my doubts about seeing this movie. I knew that John Dillinger was a prolific bank robber and when I heard Johnny Depp being cast, I was like, 'Really'? I guess he did better than I thought. In fact, he and Bale were the best.As the title says, this talks about the life of famous bank robber, John Dillinger.I was bored in some scenes, but other scenes were intense. I loved the ending. Also, the score by Elliot Goldenthal is pretty good.Overall, this is a good thriller by the great Michael Mann. I rate this movie 8/10.",8,0,1,17 September 2010
Madagascar," Pretty Funny!
","I enjoyed Madagascar a lot. I decided to watch this movie for two reasons. One because there is a sequel that is doing well at the box office and two I heard a lot of positive reviews from other people. This film has four main characters. They are a zebra, lion, hippo, and giraffe. The animals live in the Central Park zoo. The zebra decides when he turns 10 that he will head to the wild. The other animals are shocked at this idea. Because of Marty, the zebra, they all end up in the wild. This film is hilarious. I was laughing my butt off and I usually don't laugh like this at animated movies. The penguins and the lemur king are the funniest. The voice acting is reasonably good. Ben Stiller and Chris Rock were great. I really like Sacha Baren Cohen. The music is better than I expected. I enjoyed the song that the lemurs sang. 'I like to move it, move it.' This is a film for all ages. I rate this film a 9/10.",9,1,1,19 November 2008
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," Absolutely Hilarious!
","South Park is one of the most raucous animated movies you will ever see. There are so many curse words and their derivatives that it's unbelievable. There are also plenty of sex jokes to go along with the cursing. That is what makes this film hilarious! Not only is this a comedy, this is also a musical. There are some memorable songs here such as 'Blame Canada' and Uncle F....' This is about how some mothers did not appreciate their sons watching an R-rated Terrance and Philip movie and that makes them go to war against Canada bringing forth the apocalypse.This movie has many hilarious moments. I thought the funniest scenes are when the Baldwin brothers got bombed and the sex affair between Satan and Saddam Hussein. I was laughing so hard until I could not breathe anymore.Overall, this is one hilarious animated film spun off from the original television series. This movie also shaped how comedies are being made today. I rate this film 9/10.",9,0,0,21 May 2012
The Girl Next Door," Expecting Much Less!
","I was not expecting much out of this film. This film is a cross between American Pie and Risky Business even though this movie is nothing like American Pie. This is really not that kind of comedy even though there are some funny moments. I would classify this as a drama and a memorable one too.This is about some high school senior falling for his new neighbor, a former porn star. But he doesn't realize at first that she's a porn star. Things goes bad as he comes to his wits.The acting is pretty good. I liked Emile Hirsch and I especially liked Elisha Cuthbert. She looked really good and she acted well. Timothy Olyphant did a great job as Elisha's former boss.Overall, this a pretty good movie. But, I liked American Pie better. There are some touching scenes in this movie. I rate this film 9/10.",9,2,3,13 May 2010
Ice Age: The Meltdown," A Very Good Sequel!
","Ice Age, The Meltdown is as good as the first movie, perhaps better. I expected this movie to be great, but it's not great, it's fantastic. In this film, we welcome back the main characters Sid, Manny, and Diego. They must travel across a valley to a boat before the ice breaks and drowns them all. Along the way, they meet new companions of Ellie(a mammoth who thinks she's a possum) and her two possum brothers. The voice acting is great especially with Romano and Queen Latifah. The animation and CGI are great. The animals almost looked lifelike. The music is different but good. I liked the vultures rendition of 'Glorious Food.' Overall, this is a funny movie for all ages. I rate this film a 10/10.",10,2,2,4 August 2008
Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time," Great Summer Fun!
","Prince of Persia: Sands of Time is definitely a worthy movie to see. It's based off the popular video games which I never played. This is one of those movies that are there to entertain, not win an Oscar. I saw many reviews criticizing the poor writing. Well, the script is poor but who cares.This is about a Persian prince who's on the run because he has been falsely accused of murdering the king. He's on the run with the princess who holds the mysterious dagger that has special powers.The acting is pretty good. Jake Gyllenhaal is a good actor and he shows it here. Ben Kinglsey is great as the evil villain who wants the throne. The king reminds me of the English king in the movie Braveheart.Overall, this is a great, special effects laden, action film. I enjoyed most of it immensely. I rate this film 9/10.",9,1,2,4 October 2010
Balls of Fury," Balls of Comedy!
","This film is one of those films that I did not expect to enjoy. It has the recipe of a bad movie: a last week of summer release, a poor box office total, and some harsh reviews. Well, I decided to give this movie a chance. I was pleasantly surprised.The movie starts off by showing a kid who is the world's champion of ping pong. He finally loses a match and his father is murdered. Nearly twenty years later, FBI Agent Rodriguez recruits him to rediscover ping pong to defeat his father's killers. But first, he must get some tutoring.The acting is great. I liked Dan Fogler and Christopher Walken the best. George Lopez added some comedy. Maggie Q added sexiness and spice into the movie.Overall, this is a decent comedy that I liked. This is not as funny as American Pie, but it's funny enough. I rate this movie 9/10.",9,2,3,1 May 2009
Ted," Not Your Ordinary Teddy Bear!
","Who would have thought this film, Ted would be as funny as it is. Not a knack against Seth MacFarlane, but I didn't think Family Guy-like humor would last for two hours. But thanks to a hilarious, witty, though perhaps inconsistent script, this film is able to work and ends up being a likable comedy. This concept of girl vs. growing up has been done before a countless number of times, but not with a foul-mouthed teddy bear for sure and that gives this film some originality.This is the first foray into film for Seth MacFarlane and for the most part, he makes a very good and hilarious film. John Bennett happens to be the most hated kid in Boston, so he wishes for a new friend. His wish is granted when his teddy bear comes alive. Now many years later, his manhood becomes put at test when he has to choose between Ted and his long-time girlfriend, Lori.The acting is really good especially in spite of working with a puppet. Mark Wahlberg rarely works in comedy if at all and I think he does a good job in this film shedding his macho, tough-guy image here. Mila Kunis is good as Lori who desperately wants him to grow up. Giovanni Ribisi is a bit creepy as the man who wants Ted for his son. Finally, MacFarlane adds a bit of his Peter Griffin to Ted's voice which actually get it's own joke in the film.Overall, Ted is a hilarious comedy though it may overstay it's welcome for just perhaps a few minutes. Nonetheless, I enjoyed the film and I laughed very hard. People may find this mean-spirited, but it's Seth MacFarlane we are talking about here. There are many references to Flash Gordon here including a surprise appearance. This is a good recommend for anyone looking to laugh. I rate this film 9/10.",9,0,2,20 January 2014
Spider-Man 2," Exciting Sequel!
","Spider Man 2 is one of the best sequels of all time rivaling the Lord of the Rings movies. I was blown away by the movie with the special effects and Spider Man himself. This movie may even be better than the first. I think the villain is better than the first film.Peter Parker has a busy life. He has several full time jobs and he attends school full time. On top of that he turns into Spidey when the time calls for it. And here, the time does call for it with the evil Doc and his mechanical arms.The acting is decent. I felt more towards Tobey than I did with the first film. Kirsten Dunst is still great to look at. Alfred Molina plays a great villain.The special effects are amazing. They should have with the budget this movie had. The music by Danny Elfman is another beauty.Overall, this is a great sequel to a great superhero movie. I rate this film 10/10.",10,4,5,5 December 2010
The Fifth Element," Great Sci-Fi Film!
","I have been a big fan of science fiction and fantasy my whole life. This is one of those I have not seen until now. I wish I saw it years ago because it's pretty darn good and my favorite actors, Willis and Oldman are in it.This is about an ordinary taxi driver who ends up trying to save the world along with a priest and an alien in a human girl that claims to have knowledge about how to save the world.The acting here is great with one exception. That was Chris Tucker. He was so annoying I just wanted to kill him. Other than that, I loved the acting. Milla Jovovich is very good-looking in this movie.The special effects are great here. This is a visually astounding movie as well.Overall, this is a fun sci fi movie that I would want to see again. I rate this movie 8/10.",8,6,11,30 October 2010
127 Hours," Cinematic Gold!
","127 Hours is a little film that I would call cinematic gold. This is a gut-wrenching film that requires very little actors and great directing. Danny Boyle's film is another film that shows why 2010 was one of the greatest year for films ever. 127 Hours will definitely play with emotions effectively. I was feeling the pain that the character felt even though it was only psychological pain.This film is based on the true story of Aron Raltson and how his hand became trapped under a large boulder. With no help in sight, it's up to Aron to do all he can to survive and get himself free.James Franco gives one of the best performances of 2010. His portrayal as the confident, know-it-all Aron was emotional and heart-wrenching.Overall, this is a powerful film that is a great example of telling a story about humans doing what they can to survive. There are some graphic scenes here that are relevant to the story and gut-wrenching as well. This is a well-made film and one of Danny Boyle's best rivaling only Slumdog Millionaire. I rate this film 10/10.",10,0,1,8 January 2013
"I Love You, Man"," Hilarious, Delightful Comedy!
","I Love You, Man turned out so much better than I expected it to be. There is plenty of disgusting physical jokes but at the same time it's heartwarming. I did not expect much but I when this movie was over, I walked away in a happy mood.This is about a real estate guy who proposes to his girlfriend after eight months. Everything is perfect expect for the fact he has no friends who are guys. In order to find a best man for his wedding, he must try to befriend some guys. Things get interesting after he meets a particular guy.The acting is pretty good. Paul Rudd is one of my favorite comedy guys. I loved him from Knocked Up. Rashida Jones is great as the adorable wife. I can't leave out J.K Simmons as the father and Jason Segel as the friend.Overall, this is a great comedy. I can't wait to watch it many more times. I rate this film 9/10.",9,0,1,14 January 2011
Batman Returns," Just as Good as the First!
","This movie was just as good as the original Batman. Michael Keaton returns as Batman and this time he has to stop an evil penguin(played by Danny DeVito)from taking over Gotham City. Once again, the evil people or animals were just as sinister as the first movie. I thought that the suicidal penguins were a good idea, but that idea will not appeal to animal lovers. An all-star cast led by Keaton and DeVito were one of the best casts of the late 80's. Danny Elfman created another score with his usual, excellent feeling. The feeling of the film once again fills you with trill and excitement of what is going to happen. This is once again another Tim Burton spectacle. This movie is great to see! I give this film a 9/10.",9,1,2,7 December 2007
Finding Nemo," Another Pixar Great!
","Finding Nemo is a very good animated film, probably it's in the top 10 animated features of all time. The story is about a little clown fish named Nemo. He ventures out into the open sea while not listening to his father. He gets captured by a dentist and now his father, marlin has to save him from the clutches of the dentist and his 'evil' niece. The story of the film is unbelievable. I don't know how a movie about a fish can be very popular. The voice acting is pretty good. The all-star cast did a great job voicing their characters. The music in this film is sweet. The music will lure you more into the movie. The song in the film is great for people who like music 40 years ago. Once again, Pixar did not fail in its ability to make classic animated films. Overall, this is a very good film. I rate this movie 10/10.",10,4,7,14 October 2008
Superbad," Now This Is a Teen Movie!
","Superbad is a very funny movie pretty much what I expected it to be. The only annoying part of the movie was Jonah Hill and his expletive talking. I would have punched him in the face if he talked to me like that. Other than that, I loved this movie.This is about two guys who are in their final year of high school. Their main goal is to lose their virginity before they head to college. Pretty much the same plot as American Pie but hey who cares.The acting is pretty darn good with the exception of Jonah Hill. I liked Michael Cera's character. However that doesn't compare to Seth Rogen and Bill Hader as incompetent cops. In reality, no one would hire people like those. But I laughed a lot.Overall, this is a very funny movie. This movie brought back some good memories. I didn't like Hill and his f-word talking every five words. Other than that I loved it. I rate this film 9/10.",9,0,3,9 January 2011
X-Men Origins: Wolverine," Such a Fun Movie!
","Sure, X-Men Origins: Wolverine is not the best movie ever made, but it sure gives you one heck of a good time. This spin off film has all the elements of the original X-Men trilogy that made it so good to watch. There was a good, easy story-line, great characters, good acting/directing, and just a purpose to entertain the audience. That holds true for this film.This is essentially a prequel that tells the origin of the iconic character, Wolverine. This film goes in-depth on his relationship with his half-brother and how a high government official, Stryker wants to control all mutants.The acting is very good. Hugh Jackman gives all his best in his Wolverine character. There are good supporting roles by Liev Schreiber and Danny Huston.Overall, I had a very fun time watching this action-packed movie. I really don't understand why people bash this film so much. It delivers on the promise of a good time. I rate this film 9/10.",9,6,9,4 November 2012
How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days," Not Bad, But Very Predictable!
","How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days is a pretty good, charming romantic comedy even though it's very predictable and plays it safe. I could see the ending from miles away but it's how the movie plays to the ending that affects whether this film is watchable or not. For the most part, it does work thanks to the charming leads of Matthew McConaughey and Kate Hudson.Donald Petrie's film is basically a film about the battle of the sexes. The girl works for Cosmopolitan magazine and the guy works at a sports agency and they both hook up with each other despite each person is lying to the other.The acting is pretty good especially with the kind of script they have been given. McConaughey is always charming and does a good job while Hudson is actually likable for once and is remotely interesting.Overall, this is a good but very predictable rom com. It doesn't being anything new to the table but it's still enjoyable. A predictable script that should have been a wasted opportunity brings a new light with this movie. I rate this film 8/10.",8,1,1,15 September 2013
Alexander," A Good Movie!
","Alexander is not a bad movie but there are things in the movie that disappoints me somewhat.The story is about a young Macedonian warrior named Alexander and his conquests that led him past India and the struggles with his father and his mother. This movie is historically accurate unlike most films. As a history buff, I am happy with this aspect. The acting is good, but some scenes are a bit cheesy. The screenplay could've been better. Some parts of the film is just talking, talking, and more talking. The one thing that bothers me the most is the male kissing. I could not stand those scenes. The best part of the film is the music by Vangelis. The score is absolutely amazing and could not have been better. Overall, this is a nice, action-packed film. My rating is 8/10.",8,1,2,26 September 2008
Hot Fuzz," Funny, British Comedy!
","Hot Fuzz is the second movie in the trilogy directed by Edgar Wright and starring Simon Pegg and Nick Frost. The first was obviously Shaun of the Dead which is a little better than this film. Hot Fuzz has a nice mixture of action and comedy. As with Shaun of the Dead, some people may not find this funny due to the difference between American and British humor.This movie is about a London police officer who is sent away to the countryside because he is so good. It's all peaceful until two dead bodies show up. Once more people begin to show up dead, that is when the fun begins.As with Shaun of the Dead, Simon Pegg and Nick Frost have great chemistry together. I'm just disappointed Pegg really had to be a serious guy. He cracked me up in Shaun of the Dead.Overall, this is a great action/comedy film. The action actually impressed me because I was not expecting great action scenes. I rate this film 8/10.",8,0,0,26 May 2012
The Mummy," Great Mummy Film!
","The Mummy is probably the best mummy film there is other than it's sequel. Everything is great and enjoyable. Brendan Fraser actually did a good job which I doubted he would, the effects are great, the acting is great, the music is wonderful, even the plot is good. If you are expecting a horror film, you will be disappointed because this movie is similar to Indiana Jones with the the action and adventure The main character is Rick O'Connell. He is saved from certain death by a librarian named Evy and her brother, Jonathan. They head to Hamunaptra to find a certain book called 'The Book of the Dead.' They also find the mummy of high priest of ancient Eygptian times, Imhotep. Evy accidentally reads from the book and the mummy is now alive. It's up to Rick and Evy to stop destruction from the Mummy. They also have to battle sacred protectors, Americans, and skin-crawling bugs.The acting is very good. Brendan Fraser exceeded my expectations as the wise-cracking Rick O'Connell. I am pleasantly surprised by Rachel Weisz. John Hannah cracked me up. Arnold Vosloo is perfect as Imhotep.The music is very good. It's composed by one of the best composers ever, the late Jerry Goldsmith.This movie kept me interested in what's going to happen next. It is a blend of many genres such as adventure, action, comedy, and fantasy. I had a good time watching this film. I rate this film 9/10.",9,2,3,10 January 2009
Constantine," Exceeded Expectations but Needs More Work!
","I never wanted to see this film in the first place. Originally, I thought this movie would be a piece of thrash and that's rare coming from a generous reviewer like me. But, I was pressured to see this film by a few friends of mine. I decided to take the risk of wasting two hours of my life. Well, I was slightly surprised that this movie turned out to be somewhat decent.Basically, this is about a guy who's in charge of sending demons back to hell. But all he really wants to do is go to heaven. Unfortunately, he can't go to heaven because of what he does. Now he has to face off with Satan and his demon cronies.Keanu Reeves was not impressive in this film. In most of his films, he just has the same expressionless look. Rachel Weisz, Djimon Hounsou, and Peter Stormare carry this movie. They were the ones who acted well.The story is somewhat confusing. There were some scenes that did not make sense to me. The story could have been better, much better. The visuals are pretty good. This movie seems similar to a movie that came out recently, Legion. Overall, this is a film that exceeded my expectations but I would not watch it again. I rate this film 7/10.",7,2,4,13 February 2010
The Natural," Fantastic Baseball Movie!
","The Natural is one of the better baseball movies that have ever been filmed. It may be sentimental to a fault and a little corny at times, but this is a sports film that one cannot resist, baseball fan or not. Plus the ending leaves an open-ended discussion to be had and one that promotes some thinking. While this is a baseball movie, I also find this to be a character movie. This movie is about the characterization of Roy Hobbs, not about how Roy Hobbs can hit home runs.Barry Levinson's film is about a man named Roy Hobbs who has a mysterious past and came out of nowhere to help a ragtag, losing baseball team become winners. Along the way he has to encounter evil sportswriters, devilish owners, and tough managers.This film has a large, well-known cast and all of them were excellent. Some people question the casting choice of Robert Redford and his age, but I think he did a magnificent job despite looking a lot older than the film claims his character to be. Glenn Close does a solid job as one of Hobb's love interests and so does Kim Basinger as another. Robert Duvall does an excellent job as the writer who does anything for a story.Overall, The Natural is not only an excellent sports film, it's an excellent drama that revolves around it's characters. But of course, it's nice to see these home runs destroy items around the ballpark. This film also has a magical taste to it, which we see every time Hobbs does something special at the plate. Maybe it's the iconic score by Randy Newman, but this film has magic in the air. An incredible baseball film that makes use of all its talents. I rate this film 9/10.",9,0,1,19 July 2014
Rise of the Guardians," Fun Kids Film!
","I know that Rise of the Guardians has been the talk of the movie world because of it's net losses and how it is one of DreamWorks Animation's lowest-grossing films. But this happens to be a fun, briskly-paced animated film that is kind of like the Avengers, but for children. I know kids will like this because this unites all their childhood heroes. As for adults, this is entertaining enough because of the zany brightness and visuals, the action-packed story, and the short running time.Peter Ramsey directed a film that brings together Santa Claus, the Easter Bunny, the Tooth Fairy, Sandman, and Jack Frost as they join forces as Guardians to protect the innocence and dreams of children that the evil Pitch, known as Boogeyman is trying to take away.This film has a solid voice-cast which adds personality to each character. Chris Pine makes a solid, adventurous Jack Frost. Jude Law is really good as the villainous Pitch. Isla Fisher makes for a good Tooth Fairy and Alec Baldwin surprisingly, is a solid Santa.Overall, Rise of the Guardians is a rather fun, action-packed adventure for kids and adults alike. It's not the greatest in the story department, but this still adds up for a fun time. It has great themes regarding in being believed in and hope and that is always good to teach the kids. I rate this film 9/10.",9,3,4,26 April 2014
Troy," An Epic Movie of the Greeks!
","I really enjoyed Troy a lot. I seen so many bad reviews. People hate this movie because of accents. Really? You have to be kidding me. Today's society see no entertainment in movies anymore. Anyway, this is a great war movie from the Greek times. It's certainly better than Alexander which also came out in 2004.This tells the story of the siege and fall of Troy and how two doomed lovers were the cause.The acting is pretty good. Brian Cox and Eric Bana delivered gems and they carried the movie. Brad Pitt did a decent job but Bana and Cox overpower him with their acting performances.The only disappointment for me was the score by James Horner. For an epic like this I expected a memorable score like Alexander. Too bad it wasn't. Well this is just a minor complaint.Overall, this is a wonderful war movie. The effects are awesome especially how they show thousands of boats cross the sea. Two hours and forty minutes really go by fast. I rate this film 9/10.",9,1,3,15 February 2011
Dead Poets Society," Much Better Than Expected!
","Dead Poets Society is a much better film than I anticipated. Honestly, I thought this would be a film all about poetry and I loathe poetry, so I didn't give this film a chance. I'm glad I did because this is not a film about poetry, but about a group of college kids who have been encouraged to follow their own dreams. This film is a well-made drama that will make you smile, laugh, and cry. It also has one of the most unexpected scenes I have seen in awhile.Peter Weir's film is about a group of college kids who are inspired by their English professor, John Keating. Keating tells his kids who follow their dreams and they do just that. Unfortunately, the dean and the parents have other ideas for their kids.Robin Williams gives a true, inspirational performance as John Keating. He is the teacher that is common nowadays, but someone my parents would yearn to have. Ethan Hawke delivers a stand out performance as one of the kids and so does Robert Sean Leonard.Overall, this is a truly inspirational film that has one simple message for all people, especially younger ones. This message is 'Follow our dreams and don't let anyone tell you what you can or can't do.' This message should have been used back in the 1950's-1960's. This film is well-acted, has great direction, and should leave a tear or two. I rate this film 9/10.",9,2,2,22 June 2013
Just Go with It," Typical, Fun Sandler Fare!
","We all get it, Adam Sandler is not the best actor out there as most people just love to say. But he still knows how to work in a sweet, charming, innocent rom-com such as Just Go With It. This film is actually one of his better works, in my opinion, which is not the opinion of most critics I see. But, this film had some very funny jokes and gorgeous women taking up screen time in Hawaiian paradise.This film is about a plastic surgeon who gets his assistant to act as his ex-wife in order for him to get the young, gorgeous woman of his dreams. But as they all travel to paradise, is this exactly what he wants to do? Adam Sandler is his typical funny self in this film. He plays his obnoxious, child-like self and I was content with that. I never saw Jennifer Aniston as gorgeous until I saw this film. Nick Swardson was really funny in his scenes. I also have to add that Bailee Madison is turning into quite the young actress.Overall, this is a really funny but sweet film. It is a nice break from all those R-rated, raucous comedies that are being released in this era. I hope there are quite a few more films like these. I rate this film 9/10.",9,1,2,23 January 2013
Brokeback Mountain," Great but Kinda Overrated!
","No doubt about it that Brokeback Mountain is a great, moving film. But should it been nominated for all those Academy Awards? I read that people were not pleased the Crash beat this film out for best picture of 2005. I have to say that as good as this film was, Crash is better.This is about two cowboys who fall in love with each other while tending to sheep and how that love affect their daily lives.Now the acting is the strongest point of the movie. The late Heath Ledger as well as Jake Gyllenhaal gave moving performances. Michelle Williams and Anne Hathaway could not have been better either! I am not a homophobic or anything but they should cut out one or two of the kissing scenes because it easily distracted me from the movie. The movie would flow better because the story itself is amazing! Overall,this is a very good film but it could have been slightly better. There was a very soothing score that did deserve an Oscar and Ang Lee added a solid movie into his filmography. Also, I should mention that the last few scenes in the movie were absolutely perfect. I rate this movie 8/10.",8,1,5,20 February 2012
Ed Wood," Awesome Portrayal of a Misunderstood Man!
","Ed Wood, which is not totally a non-fiction film, is a wonderful portrayal of man who has multiple personalities, found it hard to get money, and is a guy who was voted 'Worst Director of All Time.' This film is often funny and amusing, but is not devoid of Tim Burton's trademark strangeness. This film captures the decade of the 1950's very well thanks to the use of black and white. If I didn't know better, I would have thought this film was produced back in the 1950's.Burton's film is about the director Ed Wood as he enters the most productive years of his life. Wood happens to be a man who is fond of wearing women's clothing and deeply idolizes Bela Lugosi, the star of the original Dracula film. Wood, with the help of Lugosi, goes on to make some monumental films.The acting is very good in the film. Even though Johnny Depp pairs up with Burton way too much, he delivers a surprisingly comical performance that seems straight from the heart. Martin Landau is brilliant as Bela and delivers one heck of a performance. There are some other great characters especially the humorous performances by Bill Murray and Jeffrey Jones.Overall, this is a great film that works very well with the black and white coloring. This film has a heart and I loved the way it explains the relationship between Ed and Bela. This film has gotten me interested in Ed Wood, and I may have to check out his 'bad' films to form my own opinions. Ladies and Gentlemen, this is your typical Tim Burton film. I rate this film 9/10.",9,1,1,24 July 2013
Chicken Run," Great Film!
","I remember see this in theaters when I was nine years old and I loved it very much. Eleven years later, I got another chance to see it and I loved it about the same because it brought back some fresh childhood memories.The plot is about a group of chickens who plan to escape the chicken compound they live in before their human owners turn them into chicken pot pies.Surprisingly, I never really knew which actors voiced each character until I saw the credits. I was kind of surprised to see Mel Gibson was here. But now that I think about it, I do recognize his voice in the movie.Overall, this was plenty of fun to watch. I don't know if this deserves a G rating though. It may be scary for young kids. I rate this film a 9/10.",9,1,1,1 October 2011
Home Alone," Very Funny!
","Home Alone is a very funny Christmas classic of the early 1990's. I thought that this film would be good, but it's much better than that. The story is about a young child whose family leaves him at home when they all go to Paris. Two dim-witted burglars realize that as well. They planned on robbing the house with no one in their way. Little did they know that Kevin would be the hero of the household. The acting in this film is good especially the robbers played by Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern. They were the funniest part of the film. I also like the music in this film then again I always liked John Williams' music. The only thing a little wrong is the violence. A PG-13 rating would have been more suitable. Otherwise, this is perfect. I rate this film a 10/10.",10,3,5,8 July 2008
Terminator Salvation," A Fun Action-Laden Blockbuster!
","I really had fun watching Terminator Salvation. I read all the bad reviews like I did T3 and that didn't stop me from watching this film. This is another great sequel to a great franchise. The action is here is fantastic and so are the special effects.This takes place during the war against the machines. It's about some guy who came back to life as a machine and sides with John Connor. He must do all he can to protect Kyle Reese, the guy who holds the key to the future.The acting is here is very good. Even after Bale's tantrum on set, I enjoyed his performance. Newcomer Sam Worthington proved here and with Avatar that he'll be a great action star for ages to come.Overall, this is a worthy movie to a great franchise. It doesn't deserve the negative reviews. I rate this film 9/10.",9,0,2,30 January 2011
Insomnia," A Great Psychological Thriller!
","Insomnia, directed by the great Christopher Nolan, is a film that shows why Nolan is one of the most gifted directors to take the camera. He creates a film thats different than his other films but still somehow makes this film seem like his own. This is a great psychological thriller that will play with your mind and has some heart-moving twists and turns. People say this is Nolan's weakest film, but this is not a bombastic film like the Batman trilogy or Inception. This is designed to be a quiet 'cat and mouse' game that affects your mind and only your mind.This film is about a detective, Will Dormer who is flown to Nightmute, Alaska to investigate a murder to a high school girl. Working with the local police, Dormer begins to set eyes on an author Walter Finch. While working on the investigation, he never gets sleep because of the 24-hour light outside so he begins to be affected mind and body and that may lead to some interesting things.Al Pacino and Robin Williams give very strong performances in their roles. Pacino just looks exhausted throughout and that is essential for that character in this film. I would never thought Williams would play a convincing sociopath but he did. I associate Williams with comedy which this film obviously is not.Overall, this is a mind-thrilling mystery thriller that furthered the career of Christopher Nolan into the Batman films. I liked how I had to think about the movie as I do with most of his films and how different it is from those films. This is a quiet film that will silently grab you with it's plot, script, and twists and not visual effects as movies rely on upon today. I rate this film 8/10.",8,0,0,18 March 2013
500 Days of Summer," Sweet, Quirky Rom-Com!
","If romantic comedies were made like this film, I would have bigger respect for the genre. I find most of the genre to be boring and clichéd. So when I put on (500) Days of Summer, I was expecting more of the same. But what I got was a quirky, charming film that has a hint of slapstick and this aura that had me watching straight to the end. The leads are very good since the actors' charisma were just right.Marc Webb's film is about a greeting-card writer named Tom who falls in love with his boss's new assistant, Summer. Unfortunately for him, she does not believe in love. But somehow, they begin a strange relationship that borders between best friends or couples. However, this relationship will have consequences.Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Zooey Deschanel are two great, adaptable leads. Zooey has the quirky charm that is just right for Summer and Joseph has that nice-guy quietness that is good for Tom. I also like Chloe Grace Moretz's character. I love how a girl who is almost 2 decades younger than her brother is giving him love advice.Overall, this is a charming albeit realistic film. This film is honest and goes into detail that not all relationships are meant to be and not all have perfect, happy endings as shown in most movies. I liked the slapstick in the film especially with Tom's two friends. I also liked how Tom got into Hall and Oate's 'You Make My Dreams Come True.' That animated bluebird shown in that sequence is funny. I rate this charming rom-com 9/10.",9,0,0,7 July 2013
Juno," Surprised!
","Once I saw the trailer, I did not want to see this film. In fact, I was reluctant even now to pick up this film. I am glad I did. This is just a great movie with something you might pick up on.The story is about a small town girl named Juno. She and her best friend have sex in a chair and that gets Juno pregnant. Now she has to face the realities of teenage pregnancy and she must find loving parents for her child.For a movie that expected to be an indie film, there are a lot of A-list actors and they were brilliant. I liked Ellen Page as the sarcastic Juno. Michael Cera is excellent as the nerdy boyfriend. I liked everyone else especially J.K Simmons, Jason Bateman, and Jennifer Gardner.The music certainly adds to the mood of the film. Most of the songs are feel-happy songs. Basically, this movie is a feel-happy movie with an important message.This is a great movie and a surprise box office hit. I rate this film 9/10.",9,2,5,29 June 2009
L.A. Confidential," A 90's Classic!
","L.A Confidential is a 90's classic and a great addition to the film/neo noir genre. What captivated me about this movie is great acting, masterful directing, and just a wonderful, well-written screenplay.This film is a mixture of police corruption and Hollywood celebrities that shaped the city of Los Angeles in the early 1950's.The acting is just fantastic. The three lead actors of Russell Crowe, Kevin Spacey, and Guy Pearce gave the best performances of their careers. I loved Russell Crowe who is a tough guy but with a soft heart for women. Also, Kim Basinger and James Cromwell gave memorable performances.Overall, this is a great mystery thriller that has a nice plot twist, a common theme for films of the 1990's. This movie should have swept the Oscars if it was not for Titantic. I rate this film 9/10.",9,3,5,20 May 2012
The Day After Tomorrow," Very Good Film!
","This film is one of the better films of this decade. The best part of the film is the effects. They were utterly amazing. Dennis Quaid and Jake G. are father and son who gets caught in the worst storm the earth has seen since the last ice age. They battle their strengths and weaknesses to survive this storm. As I mentioned above, the effects were outstanding. I liked the tornadoes in LA part the best. The acting is superb especially with Quaid. Not to sound so political, the theme is a real-life issue. Global warming is a big problem with the earth's environment. I am surprised about all the negative reviews about this film. I guess critics dislike just about everything these days. I recommend this film to everyone. I rate this film a 10/10.",10,8,16,25 February 2008
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," Plenty of Action!
","This is the third installment in the Pirates series. I think it's a little better than the second but not as good as the first. But this film is making me anticipate the fourth installment. Johnny Depp is great as Jack Sparrow. He's the reason why these films are successful.This film starts out with Jack being rescued by Will, Elizabeth, and Barbossa. The film ends with our heroes battling Davy Jones and the East India Trading Company one final time.It was nice to the original cast return. But, it's also nice to see some new characters. I was really surprised to see Keith Richards in the movie.There is lots of action, enough to keep you glued to your seats. I also love the sea goddess scene. I rate this film 9/10.",9,0,1,14 July 2010
Don Jon," Rather Impressive Directorial Debut!
","Don Jon, the directorial debut of Joseph Gordon-Levitt, is a rather impressive look on the issue of porn and how it can destroy (or even create) relationships. The movie does have a few flaws whether it was the unlikable main character or how the movie feels repetitive at times, but on the whole it was a good film with good themes. The movie is not just about porn, but it is about sensitivity, addiction, and finding love.Levitt's film is about a man named Jon Martello who has a rather unhealthy appetite for porn. He lives life to a very strict routine whether that is going to church, being with his family, or just watching porn. But when he meets the most beautiful girl in the world named Barbara, his private world and public world are bound to collide.The acting is pretty impressive. Levitt holds his own as Jon, but did I ever find his character repugnant and plain unlikeable, perhaps even narcissistic at times. But maybe that was the point. Scarlett Johannsson is just a film goddess and her beauty still shines like an angel in the film, but her acting skills are just as impressive. Julianne Moore does a good job as Jon's college friend. Finally, I have to give props to Brie Larson. She is mute for most of the film, but when she finally says something, that is the best moment of the film.Overall, Don Jon was an interesting movie to watch. I'm surprised it did not receive an NC-17 rating especially how the movie is very sexually explicit. While it may be about a porn addiction on the outside, the deeper theme is about finding love. The movie is meant to be a comedy, but I viewed it more as a drama. I did chuckle a few times though. I liked how they spoof New Jersey accents and our driving skills. As a resident of NJ, I found this to be accurate. But all things said, the film is a nice directorial debut for Joseph Gordon-Levitt. I rate this film 8/10.",8,1,3,15 December 2014
X-Men," Awesome!
","X-men is what I call the beginning of Marvel and the superhero era. After this movie was released eleven years ago, studios have been releasing superhero movies in force. I wouldn't say this is the best, but it's up there. I had a fun time watching this movie and the great special effects.This is a movie about mutants pretty much. There are two sides: a group of mutants under Professor Xavier and another group under the nefarious Magneto. Pretty much Magneto does not believe that humans and mutants should live together so he has plans to get rid of the humans and the mutants of Xavier must stop them.The ensemble acting here is very good. This is the breakout role for Hugh Jackman. He is the best guy to portray Wolverine. Patrick Stewart and the great Ian McKellan are perfect for their rival leader roles.Overall, this is a fun movie with great special effects that hold up even in today's movies. There is some charm and wit that I was pleased. I rate this film a 9/10.",9,0,1,1 October 2011
Spider-Man 3," One Step Down!
","Spider-Man 3 is a very good film but not as good as the first two. This film became less action but more of a romance movie. There is still plenty of action and extravagant special effects but there was more romance in here than my liking. But the villains make up for the that fact.Peter parker returns again as Spidey and he is forced to face a few more villains then he expected. He has to deal with Venom, the Sandman, Harry, and even himself.The acting is decent once again. I think this is Tobey's best movie. He really proved himself this time. Kirsten is still great to look at. I wish that James Cromwell had more screen time.Overall, this is a very good film but one step down than its predecessors. I rate this film 9/10.",9,2,3,5 December 2010
Children of Heaven," Very Talented Filmmaking!
","Children of Heaven, which is Iran's selection for best foreign film at the Academy Awards, is a very good movie mainly because anyone in this world can relate to the topic of family and showing love to each other no matter the living circumstances. As an Iranian film, it is definitely played safe but a film with such an universal theme and elegantly told as here should really not be missed, especially by movie-lovers.Majid Majidi's film is about a young boy named Ali who accidentally lost his sister Zahra's shoes. But their family can ill afford to buy new shoes, Ali decides to share his shoes with his sister until he can get new ones for her and so he can avoid punishment.The acting is pretty good, and pretty heartfelt. There is no questioning the chemistry between Amir Farrokh Hashemian as Ali and Bahare Seddiqi as Zahra. Reza Naji who plays as their father is also good as the man who is trying to do all he can to provide food for his family.Overall, Children of Heaven is a simple film but it displays a strong message about the bond of family. There are some talented films from the Middle East and this is one of them. It's a strong film about courage and about doing what's right. My favorite scene is where the father and the son leave their poor slums as they head uptown to the rich neighborhoods. This film shows how American kids are vastly different than kids from these parts of the world.....and not exactly in a good way. This film is a little too simple for me, but there is no denying how powerful this film is. I rate this film 8/10.",8,14,14,2 August 2014
Yes Man," Comedy Carrey is Back!
","After starring in a few well-received dramas such as Eternal Sunshine for the Spotless Mind and cutting out most of his comedy, I'm glad to say that Jim Carrey is back! This movie, Yes Man, reminded me of his glory 1990's comedy days. He is quite adept in this movie of making goofy facial and vocal expressions.This film is about a bank executive who is depressed and says no to everything. But when a friend gets him involved in a program that has everybody say Yes, his life starts to change for the better.The acting is pretty good. I was happy to see Carrey return to his normal self. Zooey Deschanel is a gorgeous actress and a wonderful singer. There were good starring roles by Bradley Cooper and John Michael Higgins.Overall, this is a really fun film to watch and it has a message about positivity it tries to bring across to the audience. This movie also tends to be formulaic and it reminds me of Liar Liar, but it the end it works out. I rate this film 8/10.",8,2,2,14 October 2012
A Bridge Too Far," Ambitious War Film!
","A Bridge Too Far is a very ambitious war film and I would even go as far to call it as the most ambitious film ever made. What makes that special is that the event the film is based on was not even an Allied victory. There was concern that people wouldn't want to see a film based on defeat, but it is more than that. It shows how the Allies will go all out to defeat the Nazis. In a time before CGI, there are some amazing visuals here, mainly the paratroopers jumping out of the planes. That was very impressive to watch.Richard Attenborough's film is about how 'Operation Market Garden' was implemented in 1944. Basically the plan was for Allied troops to fall in behind German lines and take three bridges from their command. But things go awry thanks to faulty command, bad weather conditions, dwindling supplies, and more.If there is a film that has many superstar actors, this is the film to see. There are many brand-name stars and I only wish some of them had more screen-time. Everyone does an excellent job, regardless. With a cast consisting of Sean Connery, Gene Hackman, Laurence Olivier, Anthony Hopkins, Robert Redford, and Michael Caine, what could possibly go wrong? Overall, A Bridge Too Far is worth watching, only if to see the ambition and creativity that was put forth into this film. This film requires patience, because it is a little overlong and there are moments without action. But all-in-all, this film gives us a first-hand look at one of the little known battles in World War Two. I rate this film 9/10.",9,1,2,15 July 2014
Zodiac," Crafty Thriller!
","Zodiac is a well-made thriller that does what it's supposed to do: thrill people. What makes this David Fincher film a bit special compared to other thrillers is that it relies upon talk and emotions of the characters rather than action or gore. In that respect, this film reminds me of the baseball film, Moneyball which relied upon talk rather than action. Some people might find this boring, but it's well-acted and the crafty direction by Fincher makes this dark thriller work.This film is based off the true story of how a cartoon drawer becomes obsessed with a series of murders by the 'zodiac' killer in California and how he tries to solve the case despite not receiving any credible help from anyone.As with most Fincher movies, this film is well-acted. Jake Gyllenhaal really absorbed me in as he tries to solve this case. He is an underrated actor. Mark Ruffalo who happens to be a great actor gives a great performance. Robert Downey Jr plays himself but can we really complain? Overall, this is a gripping, absorbing tale about the gruesome murders that took place over a span of many years with only letters giving hints about the murders. Fincher does a great job toying with our beliefs. I noticed as soon as I set one character as a suspect, a new one would appear. I like when thrillers play with our minds. This film is a little long and perhaps somewhat slow but it is dark and has some Fincher-like twists. I rate this film 8/10.",8,1,1,5 June 2013
Milk," Sean Penn at his Best!
","Milk is a powerful film that features a skillful cast, a true story that will cut through your emotions like a knife, and great technical skill. In other words, Milk is Oscar-caliber. From beginning to end, this is film that will capture you in whether your are a supporter or not of same-sex marriages.This film is the biography of Harvey Milk who turns out to be the first openly gay man to hold major political office. This story does a great job in telling the story on his rise to 'fame'.The acting is very, very good. Sean Penn does a bold move in playing Harvey but it works out in the end. He gives the best performance of his career. James Franco, Josh Brolin, and Emile Hirsch gives bold, sympathetic performances as well.Overall, this is a very true, emotional film. Maybe this film has inspired other people to support the same-sex movement. Also, I hoped this film has lessened the hate these people get. This movie probably would have won best picture if it was not for the slightly better Slumdog Millionaire. I rate this movie 9/10.",9,0,2,8 October 2012
The Prestige," A Thrilling Magician's Tale!
","Christopher Nolan has turned out to be one of the best directors of this century so far. He made fantastic movies such as the two latest Batmans, Memento, and Inception. This is another movie to add to that list. It's not as good as those mentioned but this is a worthy addition especially with the excellent acting of Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale.This takes place in London at the turn of the 20th Century. It tells the story of two rival magicians who will do nothing except get the best out of each other.The acting is solid. Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale were the ones who carried this movie. Of course, Scarlett Johansson looks as good as ever. Michael Caine also deserves some credit.Overall, this is a nice, dark-toned movie. I loved the setting background and the costumes. One side note, I could not recognize David Bowie. This is a great movie. I rate this movie 8/10.",8,0,0,12 September 2010
The Terminator," Breakthrough Sci-Fi!
","The 70's and 80's are two decades that produced breakthrough movies in science fiction and action. Besides Terminator, we got Back to the Future, Indiana Jones, Star Wars, and more. The Terminator is a welcome addition to that group. Despite the low budget, this movie was a box office hit and a fan favorite.This is about a machine who came from the future in order to destroy Sarah Connor so she doesn't give birth to her son.Arnold proves in many movies that he knows how to do action. This must have been the first movie I rooted for the villain. Don't get me wrong, I still sympathized with Sarah. It's just that The Terminator is very hardcore.Overall, this is a masterpiece by James Cameron. If it wasn't for a semi slow start, this movie is perfect. I rate this film 9/10.",9,2,3,25 January 2011
Hellboy II: The Golden Army," Better Than the Original!
","Hellboy 2 is such an exciting movie, visually and mentally. This is much better than the first Hellboy and I liked the first one a lot. Guillermo Del Toro is one of the better directors of our time. This movie is about an evil elf who wants to unlock the dormant golden army to dominate Earth and take back what he thinks is rightfully his. But, our favorite red action hero, Hellboy and the rest of his FBI gang including Abe Sapien, the German Johan Krauss, and Hellboy's girlfriend, Liz is not about to let that happen. The visuals are fantastic. This is one of the reasons Del Toro is a great director. He is creative designing these creatures in this movie. I really liked the Angel of Death. The acting is pretty good. Ron Perlman did a superb job playing the wisecracking Hellboy. The music is even better than the first film. I like Danny Elfman more than Marco Beltrami. This film may be a bit scary for younger children. I rate this film 10/10.",10,14,19,15 November 2008
Cloverfield," Very Intense!
","I remember when I first saw the trailer for this. There was no title for this film. I was anxious to view this film. Over a year and a half later, I finally got the chance. This is very good. It is filmed as if this movie is reality: a hand-held camera, unknown people screaming, etc.The beginning is calm and peaceful. There is a party being held for Rob, the main character, because he is leaving for work in Japan. All the sudden, trembling begins and an oil tanker is capsized. It was caused by a gigantic, Godzilla-like monster. Now, NYC is being evacuated. But someone is trapped.....The actors did a great job. Most of these actor are relatively unknown. I had the feeling that these actors were actually scared. Towards the end, there are great special effects. Also, the monster scared me. It looked like an ugly beast with the cross between Godzilla and an elephant.I was disappointed about a few things. There was no music to add to the suspense and the camera was a little shaky at times.Overall, this is an intense film that fans of horror movies will like. I rate this movie 9/10.",9,1,2,16 January 2009
Sleepy Hollow," Creepy and Well Done!
","Sleepy Hollow is one of those rare horror movies that I actually enjoyed. I am not a fan of genre and I usually avoid horror movies but since this was based on a tale I read growing up and it starred Johnny Depp and was directed by Tim Burton, I had to see this film.This is about Ichabod Crane who is sent to the small town of Sleepy Hollow to investigate some murders are are believed to have been done by a headless horseman.The acting is pretty good. The supporting cast is what amazed me. It seemed like they all starred in Harry Potter in one film or another. Miranda Richardson character is pretty sinister.Overall, this is what I call a classic horror film. I would want to see this again. I rate this film 9/10.",9,0,0,2 December 2010
Hotel Rwanda," A Fantastic Historical Drama!
","Hotel Rwanda is based on a true and sad story. This movie is based off the Rwandan genocide that killed thousands of people back in the early 90's. This movie explore the emotions of what the natives were going through and the fact that not one single country cared about the people dying.This film is directly about Paul Rusewanabinga, a hotel manager. His job is to keep himself, his family, and his patrons safe from the terrible doings of the genocide.The acting is near perfect. Don Cheadle basically carried this movie himself. He is a very good actor. The actor who needed more screen time is Joaquin Phoenix. He barely had 5 minutes on screen if that.This is a very emotional movie. I'm sure that this movie will bring tears to a few eyes. This is one of the few movies that no one should forget. This is a truly powerful movie. I rate this film 9.5/10.",9,0,0,14 June 2010
Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy," Riveting Esponiage Film!
","Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy is about as realistic you can get depicting spies in a movie. Based of John Le Carre's novel, this film is complex, well-acted, and it doesn't rely on car chases or action sequences to tell a story. I like action scenes, but there are some movies I'd prefer to watch without them and this is one of them. This is a story that could happen in real life and that is what makes this movie even better.Tomas Alfredson's film is about how there was a mole detected in the British MI6 and how everyone tries to find out who exactly the mole is.As mentioned before, this is very well-acted. Gary Oldman makes a perfect George Smiley with his long raincoats. There are other great, well-respected British actors here such as Colin Firth, John Hurt, Mark Strong, and Toby Jones. They really did well with all the turns and twists and I always had a changing opinion about who is the mole or not.Overall, this is a riveting spy thriller that does well without the action sequences. I found myself hooked to the film even though movie many people found it boring. I did feel it moved a little too slow in parts and the length was a little long. But, all-in-all, this reminds me of the old spy thrillers from the 60's. I rate this film 8/10.",8,4,5,30 May 2013
Gettysburg," A Long, But Powerful Film!
","Finally, there is a a historical movie that is accurate in more ways than it's not. Maybe that explains why this movie is over four hours long. Those four hours did fly by despite being more talking/planning than actual battles. This is a really good film to watch if you're interested in learning about Gettysburg.This film is based on the actual battle that took place in Gettysburg between the Union and the Confederate soldiers.There are some powerful performance in this film. I was really pleased with Jeff Daniels as Colonel Chamberlain. Martin Sheen as General Robert E. Lee wasn't an obvious casting choice, but it works out in the end.Overall, this is a fine if a little long war film. Some of the speeches given were powerful ones. The last half hour of the film is no doubt the best part of the movie. However, I did notice that some of the extras during some battle scenes looked fake. I rate this film 8/10.",8,0,1,21 August 2012
Catch-22," A Rather Bland Anti-War Film!
","Following along the lines of M.A.S.H and this film, Catch-22, both war movies from 1970, Hollywood was at the point where it began making anti-war movies following America's unpopular involvement in Vietnam. While M.A.SH was actually a rather fun movie following a second viewing, I really couldn't get on board with this film. Not to say it was a terrible film. But it just wasn't an appealing film, despite the pedigree of the cast and the director. There are some amusing moments for sure, but most of the comedy didn't register with me and the one word that comes to mind is blandness. Not bad nor good, but just mediocrely bland. I totally understand the themes of the movie and what the film is trying to say, so I do appreciate the film making it easy to apply its themes.Mike Nichol's film is about a military captain named Yossarian who had enough of fighting in the Mediterranean front during the second world war. Other that driving his fellow army members crazy, he decides to do anything possible to be labeled insane so he can be sent home and away from the war.One of the positive things about the film is the rather stacked cast. While I had script and direction issues, the cast was not the problem. Alan Arkin turns in a delightedly zany performance as Yossarian, and I can guess this is one of the films that put him on the map. Other stand out performances were Jon Voight's performance as one of the soldiers, who had a memorable scene near the end near the airfield. I also liked Orson Welles brief but formidable performance as the top general.Overall, Catch-22 doesn't live up to the promise I saw in it based on the pedigree. Keep in mind, this is only Nichol's second film after his promising 1967 debut, 'The Graduate.' He does get better with his future films. His direction was subpar and the writing was weak, but thankfully the cast saves the film from being a complete failure. I admit I had some laughs and was easily entertained by Alan Arkin. I do like the ideas the film suggests, but it should have been told in a better way. Oh well, not all films can be perfect ones.My Grade: C",7,0,3,15 October 2015
We Were Soldiers," Powerful War Film!
","We Were Soldiers, in 2002, was the most powerful war movie audiences had seen since Saving Private Ryan was released four years previously. Black Hawk Down is a great war movie but that does not live up to this or Saving Private Ryan. This movie like Platoon did showed the atrocities of the Vietnam War and showed them well.This film is about the 7th Calvary stuck in 'the Death Valley' with thousands of North Vietnamese soldiers surrounding them and their struggle to get out of harm's way.The acting is what blew me away about the film. Mel Gibson gives his strongest performance since Braveheart. Barry Pepper as the photojournalist gave me a few tears with his realistic portrayal.Overall, this is a true war film with a heart. I could not stop watching the movie and its intense battles. There were some tear jerking scenes helped along with a masterful score by Nick Glenne-Smith. I rate this film a 10/10.",9,4,7,6 November 2011
The Adventures of Tintin," Fun and Very Indiana Jones Like!
","The Adventures of Tintin, based off the European comics by Herge, is a another action-adventure movie that has an Indiana Jones like feel to it. It should because the original Indiana Jones series was actually influenced by this comic and it was directed by the great Steven Spielberg. This film, despite being animated, has brisk action and some cool adventure scenes as the characters travel across the world.Spielberg's film is about a reporter named Tintin and his dog Snowy and they meet up with Captain Haddock and together, they search for a sunken ship that supposedly has treasure.This film features some good voice-acting. I'm really not surprised Andy Serkis was in this film because he has a knack of doing films like this. I was able to recognize the voices of Jamie Bell and Daniel Craig.Overall, this is a fun movie that has the spirit of the Indiana Jones films. It had great action and adventure scenes and apparently people overseas loved this movie more than us Americans. But, it's a fun end-of-the-year movie people should see. I rate this film 8/10.",8,1,1,8 June 2013
Ocean's Twelve," Better Than the First!
","I heard that after the first Oceans movie, the sequels begin to go downhill. I believe that this is not the case(at least not for this film). This movie is even better than the first film! The original crew returns three years after they successfully robbed Terry Benedict's casinos. Now, Benedict is visiting each one of them personally telling them to get the money back within two weeks. To do that, they must do a couple heists in Europe to get the money.The acting is very good. The all-star cast exceeded expectations. Matt Damon, Brad Pitt, and Catherine Zeta-Jones were probably the best in this film.There are some confusing moments in this film. But that does not matter because there are only a few confusing moments. Anyway, this movie is only made for harmless fun.Overall, this is a great heist movie. I rate this movie 9/10.",9,3,5,7 April 2009
Crash," Truly Moving Movie
","This is a fantastic film that explores the multicultural society around Los Angeles. There have been many films before and after this movie came out but this is the one that moved me the most emotionally and it's hard for any movie to do that. There are so many great actors here, it's hard to distinguish which one was the best.The plot is kind of complicated to explain. It's about several groups of people who never met each other before but before the movie's end they come across with each other in some way or another.The acting is marvelous. Don Cheadle, Terrence Howard, and Michael Pena were the ones who truly blew my mind away. Their performances were so powerful I nearly jerked into tears and that's extremely hard to do.The messages here are very strong. It's all about racism and that may offend some people. I enjoyed this powerful movie tons. I rate this film 10/10.",10,3,6,24 October 2010
Snatch," One Crazy Film!
","This film, Snatch, is an incredibly crazy and rather complicated film. But also this film is wildly entertaining and despite it not being like your average jewel heist film, it's hard to put down. This film has everything from gangster violence to gun-filled action to laugh-out-loud comedy. The dialogue is extremely sharp and pretty funny. There are stand-out performances by everyone especially Brad Pitt.Guy Ritchie's film could be seen as a simple, but layered story. The movie follows a group of people from a Russian gangster to a pair of boxing promoters as they try to recover a valuable jewel. This story is significant because every character in this film has one way or another to do with this jewel.The acting is very good in this film. I think Brad Pitt delivers a crazy performance as the very fast-speaking Irish gypsy. His accent really is the joke of his character. I think the best overall character is played by Jason Statham. Usually not in comedies, he has some of the best scenes and I love how he always gets on his brother's tail a lot.Overall, this is a wildly entertaining film. If you did not like this film, I urge you to watch it again because I think it may need a second viewing. Guy Ritchie has been known for his crazy but funny films and obviously Snatch is one of them. It's a perfectly funny and thrilling British film and one of the best to come from that country. I rate this film 9/10.",9,0,3,2 February 2014
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," Cold War Paranoia!
","Dr. Strangelove proves why Stanley Kubrick is one of the greatest directors to have ever exist. He masters every genre, and political black comedies are no exception. This movie was made during the height of the Cold War, just after the events of the Cuban Missile Crisis and the Cuban Revolution, so this film was very timely. For those paying attention to current news, this film may also seem relevant today. The movie expands upon paranoia that was suffered during these years, and that created maybe the best film of this particular genre: political comedies. Stanley Kubrick's film is about a crazed general named Jack Ripper who orders a nuclear attack on the Soviet Union. Now the President and his aides must rush against time in order to stop the attack. Peter Sellers is a great actor and he shows his versatility by playing three key roles: Ripper's second-in-command, the President, and the strange Dr. Strangelove, apparently a former Nazi. My favorite role of Sellers was the crazy doctor and his German accent. George C. Scott was also very good, as the general always questioning the orders of the President. Overall, Dr. Strangelove is one of cinema's best comedies you'll ever see. I'm sure this film influenced modern political comedies such as 2006's Thank You for Smoking and 2008's Burn after Reading. But this is a film also known for its relevance as many people in the United States were afraid the Soviets were going to attack them and start a nuclear holocaust. But relevance aside, this is one of the very best of the genre and of Kubrick's career. Those plane exterior shots make be plainly fake, but that is only a very minor complaint.

Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," The Best of the Original Trilogy!
","People really need to stop being so harsh about this film. This film is very good and I liked it better than the first two in the trilogy. I liked the Ewoks and critics should stop finding faults with them. The opening scenes featuring Jabba the Hutt were slow but the the movie quickened it's pace by the end.In Return of the Jedi, it comes down to the final battle between the Empire and the rebellion. First, the rebels have to rescue Han Solo from the clutches of Jabba.I thought the acting is pretty good. It was nice to see Ian McDiarmid as the emperor introduced. The other actors were good as they were in the first two.There is more action here. There were some intense battle moments. Also, John Williams produced another rousing score.Overall, this is the perfect finale to the live-action Star Wars films. I rate this film 9/10.",9,2,4,19 December 2010
Fast & Furious 6," High Octane, Action-Packed Sequel!
","It's amazing how we are now six films in this lucrative franchise, and each film gets better and better. It truly amazes me what the filmmakers are able to come up with to please the audience and fans of The Fast and the Furious. Fast & Furious 6 continues on the track Fast Five took and it introduces us a bigger, badder villain, the cast reunited one again, a trip to London, and some high-octane action sequences involving a plane and a tank. If you don't think they outdid themselves with stunts from the previous film, you're about to be amazed.Justin Lin's film takes place after the events of Fast Five as the crew have retired after their heist, though they are still wanted. However, Hobbs offers them all full pardons if they help him take down a skilled mercenary named Owen Shaw whose gang of members include the presumed-dead Letty.The acting is really good and everyone has really matured from the first film, so that was a plus to see. Vin Diesel and Paul Walker are like brothers and are the faces of the franchise, but they did a very good job once again. Tyrese Gibson, Ludicrous, and Sung Kang are all welcome members of the crew. Dwayne Johnson comes back and does not hold back as Hobbs. Michelle Rodriguez makes a welcome return, though her acting seems a little fishy. Luke Evans makes a potent villain and is leagues above the villain from the previous movie.Overall, Fast & Furious 6 is an awesome, high-energy, action-packed extravaganza and it will certainly blow your mind away. I liked how they tell more of a story here backed by some realistic dramatic moments. This film is not all about the action, but about being a family. I also like the montage in the beginning as it shows how the characters have changed from Film 1. If the post-credits scene is any indication, I'm definitely looking forward to Fast 7. And finally, R.I.P Paul Walker! I rate this film 9/10.",9,1,3,13 September 2014
The Expendables," Reminds Me of the 80's!
","The Expendables is nothing but action. If you are expecting a great storyline or Oscar-winning acting, this movie is not for you. This reminds me of the glory days in the 80's when films like Rambo, Die Hard, and Lethal Weapon were being released. In fact, this movie brings back some of those stars.This is about a group of veteran fighters who go to some island to make it a better place and to get rid of the drug lord ruling the island.It was awesome to see these action stars at their best. I liked Stallone, Statham, Li, and Lundgren the best. Rourke provided the drama of the movie. The cameos will delight any action movie junkie.I saw this movie simply because of the action. I got what I expected. I got action, explosions, car chases, etc. The only thing I did not like was the lighting. Some scenes I felt was too dark.Overall, this is a crazy action movie. I rate this film 9/10.",9,3,7,28 November 2010
Scary Movie 2," Funny Sequel!
","Scary Movie 2 is a pretty funny sequel to the first film even though it may be a tad worse than the first one. This film seemed a little rushed but still had the same jokes from the first one. I was happy to see Anna Faris return as the clueless girl because she's pretty hot.This movie parodies films like The Haunting, House on the Haunted Hill, and Charlie's Angels. It's about a group of college friends who stay in the same haunted house for a so-called college project.There were a bunch of stars here that made this movie funny such as James Wood and Chris Elliot.I liked all the spoofs here. They were pretty good even though not all of them made me laugh.I rate this film 8/10.",8,0,1,4 November 2010
MASH," How People Can Deal With War!
","M.A.S.H is the 1970 smash hit that went on to inspire a long-running hit TV show for the decade thereafter. But for the most part, this film happens to be funny, even though many of the situations are not meant to be funny. But then again, that is why this is listed as a black comedy. You won't be howling in laughter, but you'll be chuckling often at the sheer ludicrosity this film manages to offer.Robert Altman's black comedy takes place during the Korean War and is about how the staff of the army hospital embraces comedy in their everyday lives to offset the horrors of war. Led by jokesters Hawkeye and Duke, they manage to upset the balance of the camp, while effectively doing their job.The acting is very good. Donald Sutherland shines in one of his earlier roles and is quite funny. I never noticed it before, but comedy comes so naturally to him. I guess I'm just used to his more recent movies. Elliot Gould and Tom Skerritt also do very well as Donald's cronies. Finally, I liked Robert Duvall's character. I especially liked how Hawkeye and his gang make his poor life miserable.Overall, M.A.S.H is a pretty good comedy without trying to be much of a comedy. For people expecting a total war movie, do not even watch this film. However, this film does have a distinct anti-war message and ironically enough, this film was penned by on the Big Ten from Hollywood whom were imprisoned in the early 1950's. It's a good movie for the most part and I liked how comedy is resorted to repel the reality of war. I rate this film 8/10.",8,0,0,12 July 2014
Pan's Labyrinth," Brings Fantasy To A New Level!
","This is a very good fantasy film. But keep in mind that this film is not for kids 10 and under. There is plenty of brutal violence and destruction in this film. That's why this film is rated R. This has to be one of Guillermo del Toro's finest film to date possibly surpassing his Hellboy films.This film takes place during the Spanish Civil War. Ofelia and her pregnant mother went to live with the ruthless Spanish general. At his place, Ofelia learns of her true destiny.The acting is very, very good. The girl who played Ofelia was wonderful. Sergi Lopez did a fantastic job as the general/tyrant. Doug Jones was certainly a surprise.The effects and the costumes are outstanding. I can see why this won an Oscar for the costumes. The music is great to listen to. It seems that Javier Navarete is the John Williams of Spain.Overall, this is a fantastic film though a bit violent for a fantasy film. I rate this film 9/10.",9,2,10,19 July 2009
The Way Back," Sprawling Epic!
","The Way Back is an inspiring, hold-your-breath epic that tells the story of an impressive and nearly impossible feat. Peter Weir's first film in seven years is a good one and it touches on many social themes people had to deal with during the World War Two era. I liked this gritty tale of survival and bonding with each other despite lack of trust. However, the film gets intense at times especially in the latter stages.Peter Weir's film tells the tale of a supposedly true story about a group of people who escaped from the Siberian gulag in 1940 and traveled 4500 miles through the Gobi Desert in Mongolia to their freedom across the Himalayas in India.The acting is quite good. Jim Sturgess may turn out to be a good lead if he keeps up roles like this. Ed Harris does very well as Mr. Smith and should have garnered an Oscar nomination. Colin Farrell also stands out and I like his macho, pro-Stalin stance. Saorirse Ronan is very good and delivers a captivating performance.Overall, this is a very good film that tells about what it takes to survive against Mother Nature and her forces. The acting is very strong and the story is often compelling. There are a few intense, emotional scenes mixed in as well. I'm surprised people don't know much about this film because it's a dandy and is worth seeing. I rate this film 9/10.",9,0,1,24 October 2013
Knocked Up," Hilarious!
","This is one of the better comedies of 2007. There is nothing wrong with this film. For a comedy, this movie is a little long. But, you will feel these hours fly by. That's how funny and sweet this film is.It's funny that I watched Juno the day before this. They have somewhat of a same plot. But, this movies makes it so much funnier. After a one-night stand, Alison gets pregnant. Now, Ben and Alison have to suffer through this ordeal with terrific results.The acting is great. I liked Seth Rogen. He cracked me up big time. Everone else did such a great job making me laugh. I loved Rogen's movie buddies who smokes weed all the time.Even though this movie has the dirty jokes, it also has sweet parts. This film has a little of everything.Overall, this is such a funny movie. I should have seen this when it first came out. I rate this film 10/10.",10,0,3,30 June 2009
Begin Again," Finding Lost Stars!
","Begin Again is an original drama about finding who you are and in the process, finding a lifelong partner who can figure out that same task. In this film that question is posed against the background of music and wonderful performances. I loved the gritty tone this film gives off. The film features more of a raw sound as we explores the lives of our characters. This film may not be the best film to be released in 2014, but it's one of the more soulful films. There are some good songs, including 'Lost Stars,' which is beautifully sung by Adam Levine of Maroon 5 fame.John Carney's film is about a record label executive in New York City, who is struggling to keep up with the changing music industry and is in the midst of struggles with his estranged wife and daughter. While drunk at a nightclub, he is turned on by this woman named Gretta, a songwriter who broke up with her long-time boyfriend. Dan wants to sign her to a deal, but after some initial hesitation, Gretta finally agrees. Together, they embark on a journey that will change the world of music.The acting is actually quite good. We all know what a great actor Mark Ruffalo is and I think he is perfect as the man who is struggling to live life the way he wants. The main surprise is Keira Knightley. Nothing against her as an actress, but I did question her role in a film based on music. Well she can actually sing. She's no Aretha Franklin, but she can hold her own. Adam Levine does a good job as Gretta's ex, and I liked his interpretation of 'Lost Stars.' Overall, Begin Again is a solid movie that takes place in the New York City music scene. It's not the greatest movie, but it's still a captivating one. The film has a gritty soul and a heart, so I can appreciate the tone of the movie. I also liked the one scene where Ruffalo imagines a band playing during Gretta's acoustic performance. That took some good skill. A solid movie about finding your true self and your true soulmate.My Grade: B+",8,0,1,13 June 2015
Megamind," Fun, Animated Superhero Spin-off!
","Megamind is not the most spectacular animated film I have ever seen but it still is highly entertaining. This film has a few things working in it's favor. It has a highly-talented voice cast, has great, bright animation, and it reminds me of many great superhero films I have seen.This film is about a villain with that weird-looking blue head who conquers the city's hero. When he gets lonely because he has no enemy, he creates a hero so he would have someone to fight. But, this 'hero' is more than Megamind expected. He has to deal with that and there is that newscaster lady he is interested in.....Megamind excels with a brilliant, talented voice cast led by Will Ferrell and Brad Pitt. Those two were really great and we even get to hear Brad Pitt sing. I also liked the character connections between Megamind and his fishy friend, Minion. I really liked the fishy guy.Overall, this is a solid film that most kids will enjoy. It is obvious that this film recycles plot points from better films such as The Incredibles, Superman, X-Men, and Despicable Me. But that did nothing to stop me from enjoying the movie. I rate this film 8/10.",8,1,2,10 January 2013
Alien," Great Classic!
","This is a great movie, better than I expected. I say that because I am not a fan of horror movies. Since this movie is involved in the sci-fi genre, I decided to check this film out. I am glad I did.The plot is simple. It's about seven crew members aboard a spaceship returning large amounts of mineral ore to Earth. Along the way, they intercept an apparent SOS transmission. But little did the crew know that the transmission is not an SOS, but an warning. One that will end in devastation.The acting is great and believable led by Director Ridley Scott and unknown actress Signourey Weaver. Scott is one of the best directors of all time. Weaver did a great job with Ripley. I also give kudos to John Hurt and Ian Holm, more great actors.The special effects are excellent. Especially for a movie released in 1979. In fact, It won best an Oscar for visual effects.My favorite scene is the when the alien popped out of the chest of one guy. That was scary. I think I should check out the rest of the Alien movies.I rate this movie 9/10.",9,2,4,29 December 2008
The Book Thief," The Power of Words!
","The Book Thief, based off the award-winning 2005 novel, is such a powerful, heart-warming film about how a young German girl views World War Two from her very own eyes and how she take solace amongst written words, forbidden or not. This film runs parallel with 2008's The Boy in Striped Pajamas as both feature children in dangerous spots within the war. This movie speaks volume and is powerful beyond words. I even liked the fable element of the story, where we had Death himself narrating the story. I cannot believe how critics were harsh with the film, because this is one of the best films of 2013, if not the very best.Brian Percival's film is about a young German girl named Liesel Meminger who is adopted by foster parents named Hans and Rosa after Liesel's mother is unable to care for her anymore. Hans persuades her to read and later she steals books just so she can spread the power of words amongst her suffering neighbors. Meanwhile, Hans and Rosa decide to harbor a Jewish refugee named Max, despite the risk of being taken away if they were caught.The acting is just excellent, very excellent. I can see that Sophie Nelisse may have a long career ahead of her, especially with her moving portrayal as Liesel. We also get excellent performances by Geoffrey Rush as the kind-hearted Hans and Emily Watson as the stern, but caring Rosa. Finally, we get a strong performance by Ben Schnetzer as the Jewish refugee, Max.Overall, the Book Thief is a movie that moved me beyond words and tears. It is a movie that will stay with me until the day I die. The movie depicts the grim reality of war, but through the eyes of an innocent girl. She sees the fateful horrors the Jews suffered and the film offers up a moving portrait of Kristallnacht. John Williams provides an excellent score, which serves for more tear bait. The production design is beautiful and for a film that only has a nineteen million dollar budget, the film soars as if it's a blockbuster. In the end, this is one emotionally-wrenching film, but one of the best films of 2013. I rate this film 10/10.",10,0,2,4 January 2015
Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street," Slightly Disappointed!
","I heard so many good things about this movie and I saw it won a Golden Globe for best comedy/musical. I love Tim Burton and Johnny Depp so I thought I wouldn't be disappointed. I finished watching this movie a little disappointed. It was a good movie but it could have been much, much better.This is about a barber who comes for revenge to a certain judge because he stole his wife and child away from him.The acting isn't so bad. Depp and Helena Bonham Carter succeed in making people miserable. Most of the time, their singing were bad. This could have been better not as a musical.Overall, this is an okay film. I wouldn't see this again. And once you find out about the meat pies....well I would advise not eating anything watching this film. I rate this film 6/10.",6,0,0,21 January 2011
Horrible Bosses," Hilarious!
","Horrible Bosses is one absolutely hilarious movie as it tries to push the boundaries of R-rated comedies even further as recent comedies have been doing. Some people may find this truly offensive while others such as myself, may find this to be a very funny comedy. I mean when I come to think about it, people seem to relate with the premise especially those who have nasty, horrible bosses.Seth Gordon's film is about a group of guys who are having trouble with their bosses. One expects a promotion after eight years of hard work and doesn't get it, one is constantly sexually harassed by his boss, and the other just despises his recently made boss because he wants to put other people in danger and is a cokehead. They make a pact to kill their bosses but will it work? The three main leads as a group are likable enough. Jason Bateman as always delivers a solid, funny performance. He has good chemistry with Jason Sudeikis who is also funny. I thought Charlie Day was quite annoying. However the real show goes to the bosses and Jamie Foxx. Foxx is just great in his role which I won't share. I barely even recognized Jennifer Aniston since she was so good. I also give kudos to Colin Farrell and the wonderful Kevin Spacey.Overall, this is a hilarious movie with a relatable premise. The majority of these jokes worked because they stretched the boundaries that have been previously unseen in other comedies. It would be nice to a sequel with the main cast returning but I don't think that's likely. I rate this film 9/10.",9,0,1,2 March 2013
The Polar Express," A Christmas Classic!
","This is one of the better Christmas movies I have seen lately. This is much better than the last one I saw, Four Christmases. I probably like this more because this is animated, features Tom Hanks, and great music is played. I loved the music for the film.This is about a hero boy who does not believe in Santa Claus. One night, The Polar Express arrives at the boy's house. When he enters the train, him and other kids are about to have fun adventures heading to the North Pole.The animation is very good. I liked how everything seemed almost believable. My favorite character is the hobo, he seems to make the hero boy feel bad about himself.As I said before, I loved the songs. I especially liked Josh Grobans, 'Believe' Overall, this is a great Christmas classic with a great message. I rate this film 9/10.",9,1,4,4 August 2010
Malcolm X," Strong Denzel Performance!
","Malcolm X is a really good, albeit long portrayal on the controversial civil rights leader, Malcom X. This film proves that Spike Lee is a very good director who has a big passion on civil rights and race equality. As a person who studies American history, I was very interested in Malcolm X and how his personality is the exact opposite of another famed civil rights leader, Martin Luther King Jr.Spike Lee's film is obviously about the life of Malcolm X. This movie goes through the major changes of his life. This goes through his days as a guy on drugs and deals with gangs and ends up in jail to a guy who found his calling by joining a Muslim group led by Elijah Muhammad to a guy who found his true spiritual nature on his pilgrimage to Mecca.Denzel Washington is definitely the right man for the role. I don't think anyone else could have done this role. In fact, Denzel and Malcolm X look very similar to each other.Overall, this is a powerful, emotion-filled film with a strong message to it. The montage at the end of this film is worth the price of admission alone. This film is a little too long and a scene or two in the beginning dragged on for a bit. But other than that, this is nearly flawless. I rate this film 9/10.",9,2,5,10 February 2013
Nacho Libre," Nacho Ocho!
","Nacho Libre is a pleasant surprise. I read so many negative reviews about this movie, I had no idea what to think. I was able to buy this movie very cheap, so I checked it out. I was happy with this movie. Jack Black and Hector Jimenez did a fine job.When Libre was younger, he was assigned to be a cook at a monastery. As he got older, he was still a cook. During the nighttime hours, he would be a wrestler. He has to make sure that he would not be caught and has to win the affection of a young, new teacher.As I said before, Black did an excellent job. If you are a fan of Jack Black, you will not be disappointed. I was surprised on how Jimenez did. He is a fine young actor.However, I will say that the script needs a little working on. Some things skipped and were not explained properly.Other than that, I thought that this was a good movie. I should never listen to negative reviews because I end up liking those movies. I rate this film 8/10.",8,0,0,19 January 2009
The Town," Awesome!
","The Town is definitely one of the best movies of 2010 no doubt about it. I am disgusted that the Academy decided to overlook this movie with only one nomination. Why the heck didn't it get the nomination for Best Picture? Also Ben Affleck is slowly bringing back his name to Hollywood. He has been in or directed some good pictures as of late.This is about a group of bank robbers in Charlestown who are on a mission to not get caught by the FBI. There's also a love story between one of the robbers and a bank manager who was a victim.The acting is amazing. Ben Affleck certainly is regaining his name. At least Jeremy Renner was nominated by the Academy. I loved his hardcore character. In fact the rest of the cast was fantastic.My favorite scenes had to do with the robbery of Fenway Park. I hate the Red Sox so I watched these scenes with glee. The way this offseason went for Boston they deserved to have their money stolen.Overall, this is a gritty crime thriller that works on all levels. Too bad the Academy didn't recognize this like it ought to. I rate this film 10/10.",10,1,2,3 February 2011
Underworld Awakening," Most Action-Packed Underworld Yet!
","The long-due fourth entry in the Underworld franchise brings back the iconic Kate Beckinsale as Selene and because of that, it's the most action-packed Underworld yet. I honestly didn't know what to expect, but we got a whole new myriad of characters and almost non-stop action. There is less character development than previous entries, but we don't really need that for this movie. The CGI has improved from the first film and I liked the looks of the Lycans.This film is not a prequel like Rise of the Lycans was and it takes place many years after the events of Evolution. After awakening from a deep sleep, she finds out about 'The Purge' in which humans wiped out both vampires and lycans. Now Selene must escape from the clutches of humankind and save her species.It's nice to see Kate Beckinsale back in the role that brought her onto the map. She is aging gracefully and still has the look of Selene. She can still kick butt too. The rest of the actors aren't that famous but I have nothing to complain about them.Overall, this is a solid, action-packed addition to the Underworld franchise. This film is a change of direction compared to the previous films, but fans like myself should welcome it. I do hope they make a fifth film with Beckinsale back. I rate this film 8/10.",8,3,7,13 June 2013
Elf," Great Christmas Movie!
","Elf is one of the better Christmas movie I have seen. The only movies associated with Christmas that are better than this are the first two Home Alone movies. This is nothing Oscar-worthy but it is a feel-good holiday film. I think Will Ferrell is an mediocre actor at best but I feel this is his best role.This is about a human who was raised in the Arctic by Santa and the elves. When he is thirty, he ventures out to find his real dad. Unfortunately for Buddy, his dad seems to have no interest in having him as a son.The acting is pretty good. I mentioned Ferrell before and I am surprised on how I actually liked him. The older guys like James Caan, Edward Asner, and Bob Newhart were wonderfully cast.Overall, this is a fantastic Christmas tale. It's definitely the best one this century so far. I rate this film 9/10.",9,1,3,20 December 2010
Taxi Driver," A Cinematic Masterpiece!
","Taxi Driver is a brilliant urban drama from the 1970's. This and the second Godfather movie is what brought Robert De Niro to stardom. He is flawless as Travis Bickles. He isn't the only one who was magnificent. The supporting cast was amazing especially the young Jodie Foster as a 12-year-old prostitute and Harvey Keitel as her boss.This movie is about a Vietnam War veteran who has trouble sleeping nights so he gets a job as a nighttime taxi driver. He is lonely man with rage and violence building up in him waiting to be unleashed.Now this movie is pretty violent and has some adult scenes in here. But that is not the main view of the movie. The main view is the character of Travis Bickles. It's all about him.Overall, this is a well-directed film by the great Martin Scorese. I wish this has beaten out Rocky for Best Picture, but it did not. I rate this film 9/10.",9,0,1,13 May 2011
Shutter Island," Mind-Bending Thriller!
","Martin Scorcese is one of the finest directors in cinema history. He made good film after good film for a couple decades now. The trend that started with Taxi Driver continues with his latest film, Shutter Island. This movie is one of those movies that you have to think just like in Inception. This movie builds up great suspense through out the movie.This is about a U.S Marshal named Teddy who heads to Shutter Island, a mental hospital to investigate the escape of a patient.The acting is very good here especially by Leonardo DiCaprio and Ben Kingsley. They carried this movie pretty much. It is kind of ironic that Leo is casted in the two movies that required people to use their brains.There are many twists and turns. Most people will not expect the final half to happen as it did. There will be a few people who will jump in their seats.Overall, this is a highly thought out movie. I love these kind of movies where I have to think. Too bad this probably will not receive any Oscar nominations. I rate this film 9/10.",9,0,2,17 November 2010
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," Marvel Strikes Again!
","In recent years, Marvel has been known for churning out quality products and Captain America: The Winter Soldier is no exception. It's a film that is high in action, but also high in substance and characterization. Unlike the first Cap film or the Avengers, this film is unique because it is an intriguing political thriller that was influenced by similar 70's thrillers. The film has great visuals and some darn good action scenes. y favorite is the car chase featuring Nick Fury and the opening action sequence with Cap rescuing SHIELD hostages from pirates. Anthony and Joe Russo's film deals with Captain America in the aftermath of the events from the Avengers as he struggles with the modern world and the complexity of this world. Captain America, along with Black Widow and new ally Falcon, are put to the test when Fury admits that SHIELD has been compromised and they must go on the run and try to infiltrate SHIELD and get rid of the bad guys as well as deal with the past when he finds out the Winter Soldier is actually his best friend. The acting, once again, remains spectacular. Chris Evans really builds up Captain America's persona from the events of the first film and the Avengers. Scarlett Johannsson is beautiful as ever and is a fine Widow. Samuel L. Jackson thankfully returns as Nick Fury and as always, I love his demeanor. Anthony Mackie makes a fine Falcon and trade wits with Evans very well. I am surprised Robert Redford would appear in a Marvel movie, but odder things have happened. I thought he did an excellent job. Overall, Captain America: The Winter Soldier is a film that takes the success of recent Marvel films and pushes it to a new level. I love how they tonally changed the film and turned it into a spy/political thriller. As a cinema buff, that makes me very pleased that Marvel is willing to stray away from formula. With most Marvel films, the action is great as the stunts are regularly growing bigger and bolder. The film is more complex as we see Captain America face his inner moral dilemmas in the modern world as he tries to take down the bad guys. I cannot wait to see Captain America again in the Avengers sequel. My Grade: A+",10,1,2,9 March 2015
Capote," Powered By Strong Performances!!
","Capote is a well-directed film that has a strong centralized performance by Philip Seymour Hoffman. The story itself is great and interesting and I really liked the rather dark tone of the story. I was also pleased by the cinematography and the camera shots of the 1950's Kansas. The movie seems to go a bit long, but that is crossed out by a well-written and memorable screenplay.Bennett Miller's film focuses on six years of Truman Capote's life as he is writing a novel based on the true killings of four people in Kansas. Truman meets with one of the killers in jail and ends up making friends with him. However, this will change his life forever.The acting is a strong point for the film. Hoffman delivers an amazing performance as Capote and it shows he can act in just about anything and do it well. His voice was a bit annoying but since that is how Capote spoke, I can't complain. The supporting actors led by Catherine Keener, Clifton Collins Jr, and Chris Cooper are also pretty good.Overall, this is a great if not somewhat of a long film. It's not long as the it feels like it though. But great direction, acting, and a taut screenplay delivers the goods. There is many talking scenes but they are very interesting. I rate this film 8/10.",8,1,2,29 August 2013
Life of Pi," The Beauty of Story-telling!
","Life of Pi is a deep, exquisite film and of the most beautiful films of recent years. It's a complex, layered film, but it tells a story that does not complicate things and that is a rarity. The story is deep and has meaning to it and I feel this movie will strike with the religious crowd as well as the normal audience. That being said, this movie is gorgeous and features beautiful cinematography. I despise 3D, but even I must admit 3D is used wonderfully here which draws comparison to 2009's Avatar.Ang Lee, the masterful director of Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and Brokeback Mountain, tells a tale about a guy named Pi. After a typhoon destroys his boat and kills his family, he is stranded at sea with nothing but a tiger to keep him company.This film doesn't have any big names here, but I think the acting is sufficient. Irrfan Khan is good as adult Pi who is telling his story. Suraj Sharma is decent as young Pi, but sometimes he is a little annoying. But as a one-man show, one should accept his actions.Overall, Life of Pi is a gorgeous, brilliant film that requires some thinking maybe even a religious background to feel the fullest effect. I was moved by this movie very much and it deserves all the accolades it can get. The CGI animals are well-done, especially the Bengal tiger. The score is hauntingly beautiful and the same can be said about Pi's lullaby. There are so many metaphors in this movie, so be prepared to be challenged. One of the best films of 2012. I rate this film 10/10.",10,0,2,23 April 2014
Ocean's Thirteen," Weakest of the Three!
","This is probably the worst Oceans movie I have seen. Don't get me wrong, I liked this film although the first two are better especially the second. All the characters return for this film to do more heists in the city of Las Vegas.When one of the members of the Ocean's party, Reuben gets a heart attack, the gang blames it on Willy Bank because he is a cold-hearted manager that did something bad to Reuben. The gang teams up with old pal Terry Benedict to do something about Bank.The acting is decent. All the members of the gang had more of a part. It just wasn't Brad Pitt or George Clooney. I liked Matt Damon and Carl Reiner. Even Al Pacino did a decent job as Bank.The music is not as good as the first two. There wasn't much music this time around.I liked the heists and cleverness. I also liked it when an old enemy becomes partners with the gang that stole millions from him.Overall, this is a good finale to the series. I rate this movie 8/10.",8,0,1,10 April 2009
Lost in Translation," Overrated!
","Lost in Translation is a pretty good movie but I don't know if I could like it as much as other people do. It's simply that there is not much happening in this movie. I thought it was slow at times despite some heavy, well-meaning dialog. It was also hard to get used to dramatic acting by Bill Murray as I'm used to him being in comedy roles.This film is about how the fates of a washed-up actor and a wife of a photographer were destined to meet while they were in Tokyo.Don't get me wrong here, but I thought Bill Murray was really good as a dramatic actor. He also gave me a few chuckles here or there. The young Scarlett Johansson was also good in her role. There were good supporting nods by Giovanni Ribisi and Anna Faris as well.Overall, this is a good film but overrated to some degree. This film was obviously made by a talented director, Sofia Coppola. But, I wanted more to happen. It just seemed like nothing happens in this movie except people meeting each other and being friends. Maybe I'll have to watch it again to fully appreciate it. I rate this film 7/10.",7,1,3,29 December 2012
Tangled," Bringing on the Magic!
","Tangled is the beginning of what I like to call Disney Resurrection Part 2. After a great decade of films in the 1990's, Disney Animations begun to release lesser quality films....until this film, which is leading the surge of what's to come. This film recaptures the magic of early Disney films and it shows I can renew my faith in Disney. This film is beautifully-animated and has such wonderful songs one can sit back and sing along with.Bryon Howard's film is about a princess named Rapunzel who has special anti-aging powers because of her hair and is kidnapped by an old witch for her powers and is not allowed to leave her tower. But one day, she comes across a thief named Flynn Rider whose paths were destined to cross.The voice-cast is not too bad. Hardly anybody too famous here, but they all do their job quite well. Mandy Moore is the biggest name here and she does a great job as Rapunzel. Zachary Levi brings some wit and charm as Flynn Rider.Overall, Tangled is a great Disney film because it clearly has magic running through its veins. It's beautifully-animated, tells a great story, and it just has you wanting more. It's not the best Disney film, but looking at the films that came a decade before this film, it's a big improvement over those films. I rate this film 9/10.",9,6,10,17 April 2014
Barry Lyndon," Very Fine Filmmaking!
","Now there are some people out there who may call this film, Barry Lyndon very dull and pretentious. But I found this film to be quite gripping and masterful in telling the story. This is cinematic art, and art at it's finest. There are going to be no blazing action scenes or no potty humor, but this is a film that take it's own sweet time to tell the story.Stanley Kubrick's film is based off a book from William Shakespeare and it tells the story about the rise and fall of an Irish rogue as a member of the British aristocracy. We see how this man, Redmond Barry goes from a soldier in the British's army to a man who marries a fancy widow.The acting is very good. But outside of Ryan O'Neal, there are really no famous faces here. I think that is good because with a famous cast, that may distract from the story. Some even go as far to say that Kubrick is the best 'actor' of the film. That being said, his directorial techniques are very active in the film and this film is a directorial success for the legend.Overall, Barry Lyndon is a vast epic that requires your complete attention. It does a good job in drawing your attention in. This is a film I would call as 'lost art,' because nowadays, we do not get to see films like these. This film features excellent technical skills and the cinematography will capture your breath. This is an epic that ranks as one of Kubrick's best films, along with 2001: A Space Odyssey. I rate this film 9/10.",9,4,6,9 July 2014
Full Metal Jacket," Overrated!
","Full Metal Jacket is an overrated movie but by no means horrible. In fact, the first 45 minutes were fantastic with the marine training led by Lee Ermey. Then once the Vietnam scenes came on, the movie slowed down a bit to the point where I was nodding off. This is about the Vietnam War and the horrors of it. Also, it's about how the soldiers became nobodies to killing machines without no fear. The acting here is solid. I think Lee Ermey steals the show as the drill sergeant. He's the reason why I am not a big fan of boot camps. The other actors were good despite their relatively unknown status at the time. Overall, this is a good movie but I wish the Vietman scenes were better. This is the first Kubrick film I seen, so I should check out his others. I rate this film 7/10.",8,1,3,30 October 2010
Pacific Rim," The Smart Man's Version of Transformers!
","Now I'm not going to bash on the Transformers franchise because I like the movies and they are my guilty pleasures, but they are just dumb action spectacles. While that is meant in a good way, I think Pacific Rim is a smart action spectacle. While there is nonstop action and heavy special effects present at all times, this film has more of a complicated story and a more proved(and well-liked)director than Transformers. The concept of giant robots fighting these gigantic monsters really intrigued me. It's not all perfect since some fights drag on, especially in the last half, but it's an entertaining, well-written summer spectacle.Guillermo Del Toro's film is about how humankind tries to stave off extinction from these colossal monsters named Kaijus who appeared from a portal in the Pacific Ocean. The humans create these Jaegars or mecha robots to fight these robots. When things hit rock-bottom, the world must rely on a washed-up former pilot named Raleigh to save the day.This film doesn't have a big-name cast, but they get the job done. Relative newcomer Charlie Hunnam does a really good job as Raleigh the guy who has an emotional past as a pilot. Idris Elba was fantastic as Raleigh's superior, Stacker Pentecost. I was really surprised at Rinko Kikuchi's performance because I only know her from Babel and this is a complete turnaround. But she does an excellent job as the girl who uses her fury at these monsters to destroy them. Finally, Ron Perlman does a great job in his few scenes. That man can be pretty funny at times.Overall, Pacific Rim is a gorgeous movie to look at and the visuals are spectacular. Unlike the Transformers films, this film has a purposeful story and it's more layered than one would expect. On the outside, it looks like another movie about robots, but on the inside it's about comradeship, family, and believing in another. This is a rather unique taste on telling the story about the apocalypse. While the action is excellent, some of the scenes could be more toned. Also, this film closely resembles 1998's Godzilla monster-wise, although it's much better than that train wreck. I had a good time thanks to Guillermo Del Toro. I rate this film 8/10.",8,0,2,20 October 2014
Empire of the Sun," Can't Make My Mind Up!
","Empire of the Sun is one of those movies I could not tell whether it was good or bad. I gave it an 8 simply because I liked this somewhat and it is a Spielberg film. Yes I know, I'm biased when it comes to Steven Spielberg.This is about the life of one young, British boy spending his days in a Japanese internment camp in China.The acting in this film is curious. I thought Bale did a good job, but I downrighted hated his character. I felt no sympathy for him since he is a world-class brat. On the other hand, John Malkovich did a splendid job. I was surprised that I saw Ben Stiller to a film like this.There were some scenes that went way too long and some I have no idea what happened. I didn't even realize that four years go by in the film.But the cinematography and score stand out. There were many great camera shots and John Williams always make a good score.Overall, this is a good but not great film. This is one of Spielberg's weaker efforts. I only rate this movie this high because of reasons fore-mentioned. I rate this film a 8/10.",8,1,5,18 December 2011
Glory," Glorious Indeed!
","Glory is a very good war movie. I have never heard of this film until recently despite four very popular actors. Since I am a big fan of war movies, I decided to see this movie. I'm glad I did. I expected a movie with tons of battle but there hardly was any. Instead, this movie is more of a historical drama.This film takes place during the Civil War. Robert Shaw wanted to start a regiment of only black people so he created the 54th Regiment. Unfortunately, plenty of people haven't heard of that regiment.The acting is amazing only if you don't include Matthew Broderick. Denzel Washington and Morgan Freeman are my favorite two actors. They show their skills in this movie.Overall, this is a very good film. It's kind of silly that the weak point of this war movie is the battles. But intense drama makes up for it. I rate this film 9/10.",9,1,2,15 May 2010
The Devil Wears Prada," Meryl Streep=Amazing!!!
","The Devil Wears Prada is a much better film then I expected it to be thanks to the amazing performance by Meryl Streep. Never before have I felt in love with a villainous character, but I did in this movie. Streep comes across in this film as someone who you would never want to work for. She's cold, calculating, and doesn't care for her employees.This film is about a girl with no fashion sense who just graduated from college. She gets a job working for the fashion magazine Runway. But her boss, Miranda Priestly may just end up being the devil himself.As I mentioned previously, Meryl Streep is just fabulous and deserves an Oscar win! Anne Hathaway, Stanley Tucci, and Emily Blunt also aspire to give career-best performances.Overall, this was a fun film to watch. The story itself seems to be a little clichéd with many movies or books taking up the topic of New York City fashion. But, phenomenal acting is what carries this movie. This movie also has a little moral to it since many of us had past experiences with terrible, evil bosses. This film was a delight to watch even for a male figure such as myself. I rate this film 9/10.",9,0,1,29 December 2012
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Better Than the First!
","I thought the second movie in the prequel trilogy is better than the first one. There is more action and the lightsaber duel with Yoda is awesome. Also this movie has great special effects and they are incorporated here wisely.This movie is about Obi-Wan and Anakin trying to save the Republic by facing the Count Dooku. Also there is a forbidden love story between Anakin and Padme.For the most part, the acting was good. Hayden Christensen was horrible though. But everyone else was very good. I liked Samuel L. Jackson the best.For the most part I loved the movie with the exception of the love story. I thought those scenes were tedious.Also kudos to another fantastic score by John Williams. I always love to hear the original Star Wars theme.Overall, this is a better addition to the Star Wars saga. I rate this film 9/10.",9,1,5,13 December 2010
Corpse Bride," Good Animation!
","This film is another good Burton animation, but the Nightmare Before Christmas was better. Yes, this film is not original but it is still enjoyable. The storyline takes place in the 1800's in Victorian London. Victor is about to marry a noble-like girl named Victoria, when all of the sudden, Victor says his vows to a innocent branch. That branch was actually the Corpse Bride and she takes Victor with him to the land of the dead. The storyline was good if not great. The score by Danny Elfman sounds like Nightmare Before Christmas, but who cares. It was still good. The voice acting is great. Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter did a great job. This film might be a little scary for little kids, but everyone else will enjoy this film. I rate this film a 8/10.",8,1,1,23 December 2007
Forrest Gump," Very Good and Inspiring!
","Forrest Gump is a very good movie. It is very appropriate for this movie to win 6 Oscars including Best Picture. The story is about a special person who tells the story of his life while sitting on a bus bench(for most of the time). He talks about his childhood, his first friend and lover, Jenny, Vietnam, and more about Jenny. I liked the romance in the film. Usuallt, I don't like romance but this kind of romance kept me involved in the movie. The acting is good. I liked Tom Hank's southern accent. I liked the music in the film. The score is nice to listen to and the songs are instant classics. I believe that some people don't like this movie because it seems very political with all the references to the President. Overall, this is a very good, inspiring film. I rate this movie 10/10.",10,2,5,15 October 2008
Gone Baby Gone," What a Great Directorial Debut!
","This is no doubt Ben Affleck's best movie he has done in his career and he wasn't even in the film. Instead, he shows great promise as a director. I wanted to see this movie when it came out but unfortunately there were other movies to see first. I finally got a chance to watch this film and boy I'm glad I did.This is about two private investigators who are hired to find a missing child that disappeared from a Boston suburb. Along with two cops, Patrick and Angie must risk their lives to find the child.The acting is superb as it should be. It's great for Affleck to be directing a cast of Morgan Freeman, Ed Harris, and his little brother Casey Affleck in his first ever movie.From beginning to end, I was in a trance watching this film. The drama is very exciting and nerve-wracking. There are plenty of twists. This is just a great movie. I rate this movie 9/10.",9,0,0,16 May 2010
"Monsters, Inc."," Great Animation!
","Monsters Inc is another fantastic Pixar movie. But, I will say this is probably my least favorite Pixar. I really like this movie, but other Pixar greats such as the 3 Toy Storys, Finding Nemo, etc are better. The animation is great probably groundbreaking at the time. The voice actors were well cast. I am a big fan of Buscemi so that made me like Randall even more.In the city of Montropolis(or whatever it's called), the energy comes from the screams of little children. But, the city are in a energy crisis because they haven't been getting many screams. Two monsters, Sully and Mike, accidentally let a child loose in the city. Now they have to deal with the child and a evil plot regarding the energy crisis.I should have seen this when it first came out because I did that with other Pixar movies. But this did not appeal to me until now. This movie is little on the childish side but I find adults like myself will enjoy it. I rate this film 9/10.",9,0,1,6 July 2010
21 Jump Street," Totally Unexpectedly......Hilarious!
","I did not see this one coming at all, but 21 Jump Street happens to be a very funny action film with some spot-on acting, some crazy jokes, good action sequences, and a beloved source material. When I first heard that they were going to remake this, I was not happy. But this is possibly the best way to remake it. Some jokes may be tasteless, but they are pretty darn funny. The film also deliver the thrills with some high-speed car chases and fiery shootouts.Phil Lord and Chris Miller's film is about two fresh-faced cops named Schmidt and Jenko who are forced to go undercover at a high school to prevent the outbreak of a new, devastating drug.The acting is way better than anyone could have hoped for. Channing Tatum is starting to get on my good side and he was very good here. He and Jonah Hill are very likable and have outstanding chemistry. However, Ice Cube stole the show. He has some very memorable one-liners and they still crack me up just thinking about them.Overall, this a totally unexpected surprise. I was not expecting much out of this, but I got a better film than most people realized. I'm so happy they were able to pull the film off. I guess they left a few surprises in here which pleased most people. I also like how I felt nostalgia because I was able to relive my high school moments all over again. I rate this film 9/10.",9,1,3,18 November 2013
Bridget Jones's Diary," A Deserving Chick Flick!
","It must be some kind of unwritten rule that men are supposed to despise chick flicks. I myself despise the bad ones, but I can enjoy the good ones. Surprisingly enough, Bridget Jones's Diary can fit into that latter category. The rom-com looked so clichéd and dull based off the trailers, but instead it's a warm, charming, and funny film. It's not the greatest and not entirely original, but it's still a charming British rom com.Sharon Maguire's film is about a woman in her 30's named Bridget Jones who is struggling to find love and is a little plump, and have smoking and drinking problems. Her life becomes even more confusing when these two men fall for her in different ways: her boss who has got everything a woman would want and a lawyer who is socially awkward.This film is well-acted. Renee Zellweger's role is actually quite daring and she is perfect for this role. She plays it with her best and I'm not sure if anyone else would be right for this role. Both Hugh Grant and Colin Firth were excellent and quite charming as two men with opposite personalities fighting for the same woman(in one great scene, there was a legit fight.) Gemma Jones was excellent as Bridget's crazy mother.Overall, Bridget Jones's Diary is a rather solid chick flick. It seems a little overdrawn and it is not totally original, but one cannot deny the charm the film oozes out. It's a warm film and it has simple messages of love. I am not sure if the film was in need of a sequel as the ending was so perfect, but I know I'll check it out at some point. A very charming romantic comedy and I am pleasantly surprised. I rate this film 8/10.",8,0,0,7 December 2014
Captain America: The First Avenger," Another Marvel Delight!
","The time has come! We are now at the point where we are at the last stand alone superhero film before the great ensemble hit, the Avengers. This movie happens to be Captain America: The First Avenger. This film happens to be politically correct more so than the other recent Marvel films like Iron Man or Thor, but it's still pretty good. People have been complaining that there is no action here, but they are dead wrong. This film has plenty of stylized action and great use of special effects.Joe Johnston's film is a gritty take on the popular Captain America. This film goes through the origins of Cap on how he was a small, weak man and thanks to Howard Stark, turns into a national hero. He must not only help the Allies defeat Nazi Germany, but defeat the heinous Red Skull.It wasn't a very popular choice at the time of filming, but I'm glad they chose Chris Evans to play the main hero. He has just the right physical strength and charisma to play the guy. Tommy Lee Jones is a great addition to the cast because of his famous grumpy persona which he brings to the Colonel quite well. Hugo Weaving, although not as scary as his Neo from the Matrix villain, is still really effective as the Red Skull.Overall, I enjoyed this film because it was really fun to watch. I also got a sense of national pride watching this movie. The costumes were well-made even though some people may disagree. I really liked how the ending went. The entire movie is set in the past, except for the final scene. I loved how they made the transition from past to present day. This is a worthy film to add to the Avengers collection. Bring on the Avengers! I rate this film 9/10.",9,1,3,3 March 2013
American Hustle," A Stylish and Fun Movie!
","It's funny to see how a movie that garnered ten Academy Award nominations and nearly unanimous love from the critics is receiving such backlash from the regular moviegoers themselves. I saw it in theaters and I loved it. Now for my second viewing, I did not find it quite as wonderful, but I still loved it. It is a hilarious, stylish adventure that takes a few pages from Martin Scorcese. This movie screams Scorcese, but it has a character-driven approach that David O. Russell knows so well. It is a very fun and hilarious movie and it is quite entertaining to soak in the absurdity of the film.David O. Russell's film is inspired by the ABSCOM scandal that took place in 1970's/1980's New Jersey. Irving Rosenfeld and Sydney Prosser are two con artists who were caught in a loan scam by FBI agent, Richie DiMaso. DiMaso offers them a release if they participate in his sting operation which will bring down U.S Senators and Congressmen as well as Camden's mayor, Carmine Polito.The film has an impeccable cast and they all put on a good show. Christian Bale and his wacky hair played an over-the-top con artist quite well. Amy Adams was excellent as his seductive British lover. It's funny to see Bradley Cooper play a dimwit as he does so well here as the FBI agent. Jeremy Renner does an excellent job as Mayor Polito. However, Jennifer Lawrence may have delivered the best performance as Irving's crazy wife, Rosalyn.Overall, American Hustle is a great movie. It may not be Russell's best, but it may be his most stylish and funny film to date. With the Fighter and Silver Linings Playbook, he is on a role as of late. The film is very stylish and it even made the 1970's attire look appealing. The costumes are bright and colorful. The production design is just as stylish. I also loved the soundtrack to the film, as we get excellent pop songs reflecting the mood of the film. A good film that deserves more credit from the general audience. I rate this film 9/10.",9,0,2,20 January 2015
The Godfather: Part II," Amazing!
","Godfather Part Two is much better than the original. I don't think this can be in the same league as the original. This is one of those breathtaking gangster films I would see over and over again despite its length. I expected this to be similar to the first film but I'm amazed how much better it is.Al Pacino returns as Michael Corleone. Mike is a different character here. He is seen as cold and calculating. Basically, this movie has two parts to it. A flashback of the young Don Vito and the current Don in Michael.The acting here is perfect. Robert De Niro really strengthened the cast with his amazing performance. Al Pacino and Diane Keaton delivered strong performances.I cant describe how much I was amazed. Unlike before, I'm excited to see the third film. I rate this film 10/10.",10,1,3,31 October 2010
The Bourne Ultimatum," The Best Bourne!
","The Bourne Ultimatum is the best Bourne movie. Matt Damon is back as Jason Bourne who wants to know what happened to him in the past. This time he has to face the CIA, a different kind of CIA. This CIA has directors with unapparent criminal records. Now Bourne has to deal with the ruthless director and his gang while receiving help from former enemies. The movie starts off slow, but it's very interesting trying to see what is going to happen to Bourne. Then the middle to end has action and mind-blowing surprises. My favorite action scene is when Bourne is fleeing the cops by jumping across housetops. The acting is great. Matt Damon does not slow down one beat. The music plays a part in this film. It is nice to listen to music with fast beats during the action scenes. The technical portions are above average. This movie does deserve the 3 technical Oscars. Overall, this closes out a very good, action-packed trilogy. I rate this movie 10/10.",10,3,4,27 November 2008
10 Things I Hate About You," A Pleasing Teen Film!
","The late 1990's and early 2000's is home to a truckload of teen films and many of them are the same thing over and over again. But I'm pleased to announce, 10 Things I Hate About You is one of those above-average ones. In fact by today's standard, the film manages to hold up very well. It's sweet, charming, and funny and that's what I expect from these films. It also happens to bring back some nostalgia in me especially when every social group is explained in the film.Gil Junger's film is about a new student at school, Cameron who happens to fall this pretty girl named Bianca. When he's told she's not allowed to date because of her father, that does not stop him from trying. Meanwhile, this thug named Patrick gets paid to take out Bianca's older sister, the ill-tempered Kat. But he realizes that he may actually fall for Kat.This film has some solid acting by future big stars. Heath Ledger makes a name for himself here and is really charming. Julia Stiles has some great scenes and is my favorite character. I loved her dialog between herself and her black English teacher. Very funny indeed. Finally, Joseph Gordon-Levitt is really good here as well and it's weird to see him this young.Overall, despite many teen clichés including the prom scenes which have been done to death, this is an awesome film that many of us can relate to. It's a believable story and the characters in it all seem realistic. There are some good themes such as ones like never give up and such. Of all the teen films that were pushed upon us, this is one of those that stand out. I rate this film 9/10.",9,1,1,7 March 2014
Fargo," Another Coen Masterpiece!
","Every time the Coen brothers make a movie, its a fantastic movie. The same can be said here even though this is one of their first movies. This is a very compelling thriller and I was hooked from the first scene.This is about one guy who has his wife kidnapped so he can receive the ransom money. He expects everything to go according to the plan. But of course there will be many mishaps.The acting is very good. I was annoyed with William H. Macy's character. I wanted to punch him in the face. I guess thats how we are supposed to feel though. Frances McDormand is fantastic as the cop trying to settle the case. I love Steve Buscemi. I think he's an underrated actor.Overall, this is very good movie made by the Coen brothers. I rate this film 9/10.",9,0,1,11 August 2011
Rush," A Must-See!
","Ron Howard has returned to the big screen with his latest film, Rush. Rush is an excellent film, one of his best. He surrounds himself with an excellent screenwriter and an excellent cast to come up with a product that is larger than life. I totally despise auto racing, so I thought the film would be a major turnoff. The only reason I saw the film is Ron Howard and the phenomenal reviews. The film goes deeper than just the racing aspect of the sport, as it focuses on rivalry of the two biggest stars. The characterization is layered and for that reason alone is what gives this movie a heads up over the formulaic sports movies.Howard's latest film tells the story of the most intense rivalry of any European sports figures in the 1970's: Formula Racing Stars James Hunt and Niki Lauda. Each man have polarizing personalities which fit into their rivalry. Hunt is a self-centered social party-goer who relies upon his relations with everyone and Lauda is a serious, hidden man who achieves his victory in a more intellectual manner.The acting is very, very good. Chris Hemsworth sheds his Thor persona and delivers his best performance to date. That being said, there is someone who does even better and that is Daniel Bruhl. First recognized in 2009's Inglorious Basterds, this role may have achieved Bruhl stardom. Olivia Wilde is a good actress, but if there is any complaints at all, she is underused and only seems to act as eye candy.Overall, Rush is an excellent movie as it rushes past formula to deliver something entertaining and original. It is hard to put out an original sports film these days, and Rush does just that. The film brought the intense rivalry to my eyes and I am keen on learning more. The film has excellent direction, acting, and writing but I also must praise the technical side of the movie. The visuals and sound effects are strong and Hans Zimmer creates another magnificent score. This is Howard's best film in years. I rate this film 9.5/10.",9,1,2,13 December 2014
Predator," Fun Action Movie!
","Several reviews ago, I had written that the 80's was a good time to start introducing high-profile action films. Well, here's another example of an action classic that almost everyone has seen. This is a true classic starring the 80's favorite, Arnold Schwarzenegger. This movie also introduced another alien character who movies are still being made about today(AVP, Predators) This is about a group of elite macho men who are assigned to go to Central America and rescue some people from guerrillas. But they encounter something much a worse, a killer from another world.The Predator is made well. He looks scary especially his hair. The visual effects are good compared to other movies from the time period. I think this is a good, modern action film. I rate this film 8/10.",8,1,1,18 July 2010
The Aviator," Decent Scorsese Film!
","The Aviator is a decent film that tells the pre and post World War 2 life of Howard Hughes. I must admit that I was not thrilled when I decided to give this movie a shot. It just did not appeal to me. But with all the hype, I decided to check this film out.As I mentioned before, this is about Howard Hughes, a successful billionaire who is great at having corporate trouble. This film talks about the new kind of films he made back in the 30's. Then, Hughes decided to build the world's largest airplane that may or may not backfire.The acting is probably the high point of the film. Leonardo DiCaprio is a really good job as he usually does. Cate Blanchett is really the must-see of the film. Her portrayal as Katherine Hepburn is a powerful one that even Hepburn herself would be knocked off her feet. I also like Alan Alda.For a subject matter such as this, the film is way too long. This is no Lord of the Rings so I could not be engrossed in the film in several parts.Scorsese does deserve some Oscar consideration(which it did). But, this film is not Oscar-worthy as LOTR is. I rate this film 8/10.",8,2,2,11 April 2009
Léon: The Professional," Luc Besson: The Professional!
","This film, Leon the Professional, is a very strong and powerful film. It's thought-provoking, but emotional. What I liked about this film the most is how we truly feel for the characters. The scenes that we got to know these characters are great since we learn what kind of people they are. I loved how they try to play out the relationship between Leon and his protégé, Mathilda.Luc Besson's film, which is his first American film, is about a hit-man named Leon who reluctantly takes in a girl whose family just got murdered by a corrupt DEA agent and his cronies. Wishing for revenge, Mathilda is tutored on how to kill in order for her to unleash her anger.The acting is very good. Jean Reno is very convincing as Leon and after watching this film, I believe this is his signature film. Making her film debut, Natalie Portman is great and really brings substance to her 12-year-old self. Finally, Gary Oldman is always amazing and he delivers one of his best performances. I love him as a villain and his Beethoven-loving character broadens him yet again.Overall, this is a great film that packs a punch and delivers the goods. One would expect this to be an action or gangster film, but it's more of a character study with more subtle moments. Not to say that there isn't any hardcore action, but the emotional punch this movie gives is what gives this film a heart. I rate this film 10/10.",10,1,1,5 November 2013
Oblivion," Fantastic Sci-Fi Film!
","Oblivion is pure modern science-fiction entertainment and it was a blast to watch. It has an interesting post-apocalyptic story that takes place on a damaged Earth and it raises some interesting questions. Not only does this film require you to think at times, it's a visually-stunning film that has excellent cinematography and plenty of action. Plus, it has Tom Cruise. What can go wrong with Tom Cruise?Joseph Kosinski's sci-fi actioner is about a man named Jack Harper who is one of the last people on Earth along with his lover named Vika because many years prior, the Earth was attacked by extraterrestrial beings causing the remaining inhabitants to relocate to Saturn's moon, Titan. Harper's job is to protect the fusion energy generators which provide the power. But after discovering this mysterious woman who crash-landed on Earth, Jack begins to question his entire existence.This film is well-acted and that is one of the highlights of this film. Tom Cruise is a max-effort actor and once again he shows why. He brings commitment into his role as Jack Harper and he made his character very interesting. Morgan Freeman is excellent, but he is not in the film as much as the trailers or posters would suggest. But his role is very pivotal. Melissa Leo is creepily cheerful in her role, but you'll know why once you see the film. Finally, our ladies are not only attractive, but they do well as the much younger love interests of Tom Cruise.Overall, Oblivion is a fantastic, action-packed sci-fi film that is a wonderful time. Based off the some the reviews I read, I wasn't keen on seeing this film. But once again, time proves again that movies are subjective. Despite the reviews, I enjoyed every part of this movie. Tom Cruise once again defies time and age in this visually-stunning, post-apocalyptic movie. I rate this film 9/10.",9,0,0,2 August 2014
"Good Morning, Vietnam"," Robin Williams At His Best!
","Good Morning, Vietnam is often a funny and witty movie thanks to the fast-speaking talent of Robin Williams. Williams delivered his lines at his usual rapid pace and that makes things all the funnier. But in order to effectively deliver the material, he needed a great screenplay and that's what he got. It delivers the goods and some of the lines are just funny. My favorite is when the film lambasts Richard Nixon. I was in hysterics.Barry Levinson directs a film about the fast-talking radio host named Adrian Cronauer who is sent to Saigon to be the funny on-air personality everyone is raving about. The brass may dislike him for his on-air antics, but he has gained the ears of the common soldier.This is the perfect role for Robin Williams. His approach to comedy is perfect for this role. Some people may find this annoying, but I was laughing very hard throughout. He's at best when he was on-air. His off-air scenes were good, but they were more considered melodrama than comedy.Overall, Good Morning, Vietnam is a very funny film thanks to the presence of Robin Williams. This can also be considered a war film, but it's a rather unusual take on war film. But with Vietnam still fresh on many people minds at this point, this was a good way to tell the story: with comedy. I rate this film 9/10.",9,1,1,21 May 2014
American Pie," Very Very Funny!
","This is one of the best comedy films I have ever seen. The first one beats all the other American Pie movies. The jokes are incredible. I was laughing so much, I thought that I would puke or I would suffer a heart attack from all my laughing. The acting was great. In my opinion, I thought that Jason Biggs and Thomas Ian Nicholas were the best. Jennifer Coolidge had great cameos as Stifler's Mom. The girls were very hot and they got my attention. The script is excellent, the music was just right, and this is a valuable piece for a large movie collection such as mine. I highly recommend this for people between the age of 15-40. Most adults after the age of 40 will think that this movie is horrible and won't be able to understand most jokes. I give this a definite 10/10.",10,1,3,5 December 2007
Burn After Reading," Good, But Confusing!
","Don't get me wrong, but I was pretty darned confused after watching this movie. I still liked this film, but I was amazed that I was very confused. That normally doesn't happen.The plot is kind of hard to explain. The story is about two gym freaks obtaining a CIA CD by theft and it contains a memoir written by a recently-fired CIA drunk. Now the two gym freaks want to exchange the CD for money so one of of the freaks, Linda can have four plastic surgeries.The movie is filled with talented actors and they live up to expectations. George Clooney did excellent but I was really impressed with Brad Pitt. He is the goofball of the gym freaks. He looks younger in this movie than he really is. Frances McDormand was so-so.I can't see why some people are saying that this sucks. This movie is certainly confusing but not so confusing where you have no idea what the hell is going on. This movie should pick up some awards. I rate this movie 7/10.",8,2,5,31 December 2008
The Last Legion," Best Low-Budget War Film in Years!
","I never really expected The Last Legion to turn into a really good movie despite the fact that I wanted to see it badly. It turns out that I was wrong. This is an excellent movie. The actors were not miscast, the music was not horrible, the plot was not weak, etc. I was reading some negative reviews and the things I mentioned were the opposite in those reviews.This story is based on the legend of Excalibur and King Arthur. The Romans are struggling to keep their empire. Young Romulus has been crowned Caesar. Then, the Goth invade Rome. Romulus and his teacher Merlin lands in prison. It's up to a bunch of loyal soldiers to rescue him, overcome betrayal, and defeat two enemies at once.The acting is pretty good. Everyone said that the actors were miscast but I disagree. Colin Firth did a wonderful job as Aurelius and Thomas Sangster was great as Romulus. Also, the lady who played the girl warrior is beautiful.I don't know how the music can be considered inappropriate as a reviewer said in one comment. The music is just fine. He also said that there are no characters to relate to. He doesn't know all the people who saw this movie. Finally, he and other people said this movie is historically inaccurate. I really don't think that this movie is about history.Overall, this is great film. This is one of the cleaner war films in recent history. There is no cursing or overdone sexual scenes, just battle violence. I rate this film 10/10.",10,8,15,31 January 2009
Watchmen," Not Your Average Superhero Movie!
","Watchmen is definitely not the your average superhero movie you would come to expect. Zach Snyder did a very good job on changing things up and pointing out the flaws in each superhero character. Also, this movie is so much more violent than most superhero films. This film does a good job on showing the gore, blood, and sex.This film is about a group of retired superheroes who reunite after a death of their own. Once reunited, they find a diabolical plan to destroy the world.The acting is really good. The people who stood out to me was Malin Akerman and Jeffrey Dean Morgan as 'The Comedian.' I thought he was the best character in the film.Overall, this is a visually-striking film that is a little bit long. But this film has great action scenes and great character development. Watchmen is not your ordinary Spider-Man or Batman. I rate this film 9/10.",9,3,6,29 October 2012
The Bourne Identity," Very Good Action Film!
","The Bourne Identity is a great movie to begin a great series. Everything is pretty darn good with this film. The movie is about a CIA guy named Jason Bourne. The movie starts with his being found by a group of fisherman and Bourne not remembering who he was. He teams up with one girl named Marie and they got involved in a CIA plot that involved killing. The acting is very good in this movie. Matt Damon and Franka Potente had great chemistry together. Also, I liked the way that the CIA were portrayed as evil. The action in this film is great from beginning to end. It kept me at the edge of my seat until the end credits. The music is great to listen to because it's fast-paced and it keeps up with the movie. Overall, this is a good action flick. I rate this film 10/10.",10,2,4,7 October 2008
The Italian Job," Great Heist Movie!
","This is one of those summer films that the only intention is to please the audience, not win any Oscars. Of course, there were many negative reviews but being an avid movie watcher, I don't base my reviews off those. I enjoyed this film because it's just one of those films that I can watch and easily like.This is about a group of thieves preparing for one last heist. Unfortunately, they were double-crossed by one of their own and were left for dead. Now it's a time for vengeance and payback.The acting is pretty good. There are a bunch of A-list actors that were great. I don't care what people say about Mark Wahlberg, but he's a good actor. Charlize Theron is very good to look at. I love all of Jason Statham's action movies including this one. But the star is Edward Norton. He makes a great villain.Overall, this movie is a good adrenaline rush. I loved the mini cars in the film. Better than those hotshot cars in the Fast and the Furious movies. I rate this film 8/10.",8,2,3,2 November 2010
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," An Instant Classic!
","When I first saw this movie, I knew that this is going to be a classic and a box-office hit(which it was). This film is so amazing, I hardly have any words and this is the worst of the three LOTR movies. The movie starts with Frodo Baggins inheriting a doomed ring from his second cousin, Bilbo Baggins. Along with Frodo, 3 more hobbits, 2 men, a wizard, an elf, and a dwarf must venture to the Mordor where the evil Sauron reigns to destroy the cursed ring. The actors were cast perfectly. Elijah Wood, Ian McKellen, and Viggo Mortensen were great as their respective roles. The music is amazing. Howard Shore lives up to my score expectations. This soundtrack is one of the better ones with the Celtic-like themes. The special effects are great especially during the battle scenes. There are some sad moments in this film. I was sad to see Boromir die. He meant no harm to Frodo and he made it up by sacrificing his life for Merry and Pippin. I was sad to see Gandalf 'die.' But, I'm sure that he will be back. This movie deserves more than 4 Academy Awards. I rate this movie 10/10.",10,2,2,8 November 2008
The Matrix Revolutions," Great Action But Rest is Subpar!
","I have to say the same thing about this movie as I said about Reloaded. The action is great. The choreography is very good. But everything else about this film may be average, mediocre at the most. There are many plot holes here and the drama is not really that good.This is the final installment of the Matrix. Basically, the citizens are fighting against the invasion of the machines one last time.The acting is OK. As I said in earlier reviews that featured Keanu Reeves, he is not the bast actor ever. Laurence Fishburne, however, is a great actor.Overall, this is probably the worst film in the Matrix trilogy. I'm not saying this is bad but the first two were better. It's just me, but I think the Matrix trilogy is overrated. I rate this film 7/10.",7,0,1,3 July 2010
Man of Steel," Man of Steel Is The Man of Action!
","The latest installment in the long-running Superman franchise continues with the newest reboot, Man of Steel. This new origin story tells of the tale of two movies. The first half is a character story which is effectively told with the use of flashbacks, while the final half is just explosion after explosion after explosion. Not to say it was bad, but the long-running action sequences (and rather impressive ones), were really loud and the non-stop action will be bound to give you headaches, especially in a movie theater setting.Zach Snyder's Superman film talks about how Superman came to Earth after Krypton was destroyed, how he struggled as a boy to control his powers and keep them as a secret, and to present time where he faces the nefarious General Zod who wants to turn Earth into a new Krypton.The acting is actually really good. Henry Cavill did impress me as Superman/Clark Kent and is leagues better than Brandon Routh. Michael Shannon was mean and great as Zod, despite the fact you can understand the reasons for wanting to destroy Earth. Amy Adams was good as Lois Lane, but I don't know if I can truly connect with her character in this movie. Kevin Costner probably had the best role as Jonathan Kent and as the man who gives Clark advice on how to grow up. We also get some good performances by Russell Crowe, Laurence Fishburne, and Diane Lane.Overall, Man of Steel is ultimately a visually-spectacular, CGI-loaded reboot of one of the most iconic superheroes of all time. It could have used some more substance, but then again people complained that 2006's Superman Returns had no action sequences, hence this film having many. I will admit that they are well-done and often breath-taking. But is having too much of this action a good thing? Perhaps, though it did grow a little old and loud after awhile. But nothing wrong with that. I rate this film 8/10.",8,4,7,22 September 2014
Grease," 'Of Course Not, It's Only The Beginning!'
","When it comes to film and musicals, I am not a big fan. I don't know why, but I can't seem to get into musicals. However, Grease is more than just a musical. It's practically the way of life. This film brought back fond memories of my high school days and this film plays a major role in my childhood. As a musical, this film has many foot-tapping rock'n'roll songs that are very good. As a movie, this story doesn't offer anything new, but it's still entertaining and you care about the characters which I find matters most.Randal Kleiser's film starts off with a young couple, Danny and Sandy believing they will never see each other again. But little did they know, Sandy happens to be the new kid at their high school. Will Danny, a member of a gang, will be able to capture the heart of the girl he loves? The acting is pretty good and memorable. John Travolta and Olivia Newton-John have very good singing voices and they know how to rock their hearts out. They are also good actors and this is the film that put them on the map. The rest of the cast led by Stockard Channing ranges from pretty funny and goofy to mildly annoying. Nonetheless, they are important factors in this story as they are the soul to Travolta's/John's heart.Overall, this is a near instant classic thanks to some energizing music. Despite the lack of newness, coming-of-age films always hold a dear spot in my heart and I will always cherish them and this is what makes Grease special. My favorite scene is the ballroom dance scene towards the end. There are some groovy dance moves here and was very entertaining to watch, just like the film itself. I rate this film 9/10.",9,2,3,1 January 2014
Footloose," Great Film!
","Footloose is a pretty good film. I thought it's better than what people portray this movie to be. I know that this is not Grease, but it's better than Flashdance. I have wanted to see this film since i went on a sixth grade field trip to see a play based on this film.This film is based on a ridiculous but true story. It's about a town that has banned dancing. But the new kid in town played by an amazing Kevin Bacon is about to defy that rule and get the minister's daughter while he's at it.My favorite scene in the movie is the very beginning when we see all the shoes dance. The soundtrack is really good. I love Kenny Loggins because he performs great music. Also, RIP Chris Penn! You were good in this movie. I rate this film 8/10.",8,1,3,20 March 2010
Cast Away," Interesting Film!
","Cast Away is not a bad movie as some of the negative reviews say. This is certainly not an ad for Fed-Ex. What this movie is is a serious piece of art by acclaimed film maker Robert Zemeckis that stars Tom Hanks.This film is about Fed-Ex worker, Chuck who gets stranded on a remote island in the Pacific Ocean. That happens because his airplane crashed. Now, Chuck has to outwit nature in order to survive and come back home.The acting is great. The only two well-known actors are Tom Hanks and Helen Hunt. Hanks did a phenomenal job.I will admit that some things are incredulous and boring at the least. Some parts are slow especially during the island scenes. The scenes with the volleyball made me think, 'What the heck?' The thing that gets this movie to work is the odds of surviving on a remote island no one have ever heard of. Overall, this is a basic survival film. I rate this film 8/10.",8,3,4,4 April 2009
Lilo & Stitch," Great Disney Picture!
","I actually liked Lilo and Stitch. I went to this film with low expectations and came out with a delightful smile on my face. Disney always does a good job with their animated features. This film is about a dog-like alien who escaped from a ship that was bringing him to exile. He lands on Earth and to escape from aliens searching for him, he ends up being a pet for Lilo and her sister. He wreaks havoc at first but as the movie goes on, he learns to have better control. The animation is pretty good, not the best. I am happy to say that there is Elvis in this film. Many classic hits are in this movie. I am also happy that this could've won an Oscar because this film was nominated for Best Animated Feature. This was a great idea by Chris Sanders. Overall, this is a great family film. I rate this movie 9/10.",9,2,2,7 November 2008
Armageddon," So much better than expected!
","I must say that Armageddon is the best movie of 1998! The film has mind-blowing special effects, tons of humor, and great sci-fi action. In the movie, a NASA director discovered that the Earth had 18 days before it's demolished by an asteroid. He and his colleagues trains a group of oil drillers for space only in a few days. Then the director played by Billy Bob Thornton sends the team to the asteroid and they must place a nuclear warhead in the meteor or else. I don't know why there's negative hype about the film, but I enjoyed it a lot. The all-star cast led by Bruce Willis, Thornton, and Ben Affleck was just amazing. I liked the song by Aerosmith in the film. I recommend this movie to everybody, but try to keep all the negative things out of your mind when viewing this film. I give this film a 10/10.",10,4,9,12 April 2008
The Village," Creepy But Story Not As Effective!
","Unfortunately, this seems to be the film that has changed director M. Night Shymalan's career for the worse. This film, The Village, is not a bad film at all, but the story is clunky and is all over the place. Unfortunately, I was able to see the signature twist ending from a mile away, but maybe that was because I saw Scary Movie 4 spoof this film. But, this film is pretty creepy and the cinematography is excellent thanks to Roger Deakins.M. Night's film is about a secluded village out in the middle of nowhere that has a secret. This secret, that the woods surrounding the village is swarming with monsters, is challenged when one of the villagers wants to venture out in the woods.The film is well-acted for the most part. The film has an all-star cast and they do well with what the were given. Joaquin Phoenix, Bryce Dallas Howard, Adrien Brody, and William Hurt all do really good in their roles.Overall, this is a decent film that racks up a few thrills. I was disappointed with the ending which I would have found weak even if I haven't known what was going to happen. I feel bad for M. Night because his previous films were great and no one knew at the time this would be a lot more than a blip on the radar. All-in-all, this is a good, somewhat scary film. I rate this film 7/10.",7,0,0,1 August 2013
21," More Exciting Than I Thought!
","21 is a solid drama/thriller that is better than I thought it would be based off the trailers I have seen. However, based off the material the story was based on, it could have been.......more. At a first glance, this film may seem uninteresting. But, it was made in a way that would attract your attention. Card counting is not an interesting subject, but I liked how this film made it to be.Robert Luketic's film is based off a true story about how several MIT students and their professor head off to the Las Vegas casinos to make money, perhaps not from the most legal way.The acting is not too bad. Jim Sturgess has the makings of being a fine actor and he shows promise here. As always, Kevin Spacey is great. The same could be said for Laurence Fishburne. However, I was not a big fan of Kate Bosworth though.Overall, 21 is a good movie but it does have some faults. It seems to have a weaker script than one would expect for this kind of film. Also, I thought the editing seemed a bit off. But other than that, I generally liked this movie. I rate this film 8/10.",8,0,0,15 December 2013
Trouble with the Curve," Family is What Matters Most!
","Trouble with the Curve is the latest film that has baseball as it's 'main' theme, but this film goes beyond the meaning of baseball. This film is about family and what family means to each everybody. Though predictable, this film offers enough substance to keep the audience entertained. It's nice to see Clint Eastwood take another starring role, especially after when he said Gran Torino would be his last. As a baseball fan, this is a good movie. But as a lover of cinema, this is also good in 'cinema' terms.This is the directing debut for Robert Lorenz who worked with Eastwood in many of his films. Clint plays Gus, an aging baseball scout who is tasked to scout this big-time prospect for the Atlanta Braves. But his vision is rapidly declining, so his friend Pete has asked his estranged daughter, Mickey to keep an eye on Gus despite his stubbornness.If this is truly Eastwood's last acting role, it's a good hurrah. It's not his best role, but the grizzled actor reminded me much of his role in Gran Torino. Amy Adams, as always, is perfect in her role. Justin Timberlake is decent, not great. I really liked Matthew Lillard as the computer sleazebag and totally different than his usual roles.Overall, this is a fun movie to watch and passes as good escapism. It's not the kind of drama that will win awards, but it's one that will play with your emotions and is sentimental to a fault. It's a bit predictable at times, but the performances makes this predictability not matter. A good sports film with a great message regarding family. I rate this film 9/10.",9,1,2,10 March 2014
Pitch Black," Solid Sci-Fi!
","Pitch Black is a decent movie. Because this fits the genre that I love the most, I thought I would love this. When I saw the concept, I thought there was no way this would be a bad movie. I was right in a way. It's not a bad movie but it's nothing spectacular. The first fifteen or so minutes of the movie actually sucked minus the superb crash landing. By the end, I was enjoying the movie though.This is about a group of survivors who crash landed on a barren planet and its up to a convict to lead the group away from monsters and off the planet to safety.The acting is not so bad. I think this is the movie where Vin Diesel makes a name for himself. I liked him here. The other actors were decent, nothing special.Overall, this is a decent sci-fi film that is enjoyable except in the torrid beginning. I also liked the design of the monsters. They were very creepy. I rate this film 7/10.",7,1,2,22 September 2011
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1," Bleakest But Most Mature Harry Potter Film Yet!
","Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1 is the total opposite of what the Sorcerer's Stone was. The young leads are more mature in this film and the film is by far the most dreary and bleakest thanks to great cinematography by Eduardo Serra. The decision to turn Deathly Hallows into two parts is a very wise one. Harry, Ron, and Hermione returns in the seventh installment of the very popular Harry Potter franchise. They head out to hunt down the Horcruxes in order to destroy Voldemort. But while they do that, they must deal with dark forces chasing them, fear for loved ones, and above all each other.Radcliffe, Grint, and Watson deliver their most mature performances yet. As the series progressed, they have increasingly gotten better. One thing I always liked about the Potter films is the large supporting cast and how they manage to be effective. Once again, they were very effective in this film.Overall, this is David Yate's best Harry Potter film to date. The story is constructed well thanks to a tight screenplay by Steve Kloves. This film also tends to be emotional at times especially the beginning scene and several of the final scenes. There are also some welcome character returns from previous installments. All in all, this may be the best Harry Potter film yet. I rate this film 10/10.",10,0,2,12 January 2013
Cold Mountain," Better Than I Thought!
","I never had an intention to see this movie because I thought all there would be is sappy romance and I hate those kind of movies. There were only a few romantic scenes but not as I much as I anticipated. There are actually a few good battle scenes from the Civil War here.This is about the lives of a reverend daughter and a Confederate soldier and how they must cope without each other as he's away at war.The acting is special. I loved all the performances but Renee Zellweger as the farmgirl tops them all. Her accents and dialogue really amused me.This movie does have a tendency to make people cry. There are many tear-breaking moments here.Overall, this is a pretty good movie. I would love to see it again. I rate this movie 8/10.",8,1,1,26 September 2010
Kung Fu Panda 2," Fun Sequel!
","Kung Fu Panda 2 is the animated sequel we all came to expect and more. Unlike many sequels, this sequel doesn't really have the same story as the original. It has a new story which explain Po's past and how he came to be the panda we know him to be. It has a new villain, Shen who would kick the original villain, Tai Lung's butt with no problem. The animation is strikingly beautiful, even better than the original.Jennifer Yu's film continues the adventures of Po and the Furious Five. When the evil peacock, Shen takes over a famed, historic city, Po and gang are sent out to reclaim the city and destroy Peacock and his new weapon that he favors.This film has the ultimate voice cast. Jack Black proves that he has what it takes to be a successful voice actor. He provides wit and charm to Po who we have all came to endure. This voice cast has an array of talent which includes Angelina Jolie, Dustin Hoffman, Gary Oldman, and more.Overall, this is a really fun film which some emotional moments within Po's backstory. I enjoyed the kung fu fighting as always. This movie has a great mixture of comedy and action, thought I remember the original not being as funny as this movie. I rate this film 9/10.",9,0,1,16 February 2013
American Psycho," Complex Portrayal of a Disturbed Man!
","I never knew what to think of American Psycho because I have not see it until now. I knew it was a complex, disturbing movie just from talking to other people. But, it also a well-made thriller with a wonderful lead performance by Christian Bale and the way the movie told the story is very mesmerizing. I heard the film is different than the book. but I love the way the movie painted the black-and-white picture of Patrick Bateman.Mary Harmon's movie is about a modern, iconic screen character named Patrick Bateman. By day, Bateman is just your normal guy who works and has friends. But, by night he is a cold-blooded killer with a lust for blood.Christian Bale is perfect for the role. Not only I see him as Batman, now I see him as Patrick Bateman. He has the charisma for the role and I just love the way he talks about his music. He's very enlightening and.....scary.Overall, this is a well-made, violent thriller about a guy who is mentally damaged. Some scenes are very graphic but this movie paints a picture that you'll remember for a very long time. I rate this film 9/10.",9,0,0,5 July 2013
Little Miss Sunshine," Very Good American Comedy!
","Little Miss Sunshine is better than I expected it to be. Even though this movie was nominated for Best Picture, I did not think that this movie would reach my expectations. Boy, I was wrong. This isn't the comedy that most people are accustomed to, this is a dark comedy that will have you laughing then in tears.The story is simple. It's about a girl who wants to win the beauty pageant in California. Her family then decides to drive to California. Of course, the family is dysfunctional. The grandpa is a foul-mouthed drug user, the uncle is gay and suicidal, the mother is pro-honesty, the dad is all about being a winner or a loser, and the brother won't speak a word at all.The cast did a great job. Alan Arkin deserves the Oscar for his performance. Steve Carell has a nice career blossoming. In short, everyone did a great job. The thing that amazes me is that this movie took three million dollars to make. The box office gross is almost 20 times larger. Overall, this is one of the best comedies made recently. I rate this movie 10/10.",10,3,6,19 January 2009
Knowing," Excellent Sci-Fi Film!
","This is a great sci-fi film. In fact, it may be the best one one of its genre of 2009(so far). I did not expect much from this film, but I was surprised when the end credits rolled on the screen. I can tell that thought was put into this film.This is about a college professor who tries to decode clues of past and upcoming revelations of shocking incidents that was predicted by a young girl fifty years ago.The acting is very good. I am glad that Nicolas Cage did a good job. I liked him in the National Treasure movies. The other relatively unknown actors did a pretty good job.This film always has something to it whether it's mystery or action scenes with great effects. Keep in mind that this film was directed by the same director as I, Robot. This is a really good film. I rate this film 10/10.",10,2,7,22 July 2009
Coriolanus," Interesting Shakespeare Adaptation!
","Coriolanus is a pretty interesting and engaging effort by Ralph Fiennes who is making his directorial debut with this film. I liked the idea with setting the film in modern times a la Jesus Christ Superstar, but I don't know if I liked the idea of using Shakespeare language because the film sometimes got confusing with all the old English. That being said, it's a fun, violent film and is pretty faithful to the original source as well.Fienne's film is about a general named Coriolanus who is expelled from Rome by the people because of his tyranny. So he sides with his mortal enemy, the Volscian leader Aufidius to take back Rome.The acting is pretty good. Ralph Fiennes does a solid job as lead actor and has some intense moments. Likewise, Gerard Butler does a good job as the blood lust Aufidius. Brian Cox and Vanessa Redgrave have good moments. As much as I like Jessica Chastain, I feel like she is not needed in this film.Overall, this is a good adaptation of Shakespeare and I love how it is set in modern times. But they should have stuck with modern English to avoid any confusion. I can't believe not many people saw this film, but it's a watchable, entertaining one. I rate this film 8/10.",8,0,3,27 October 2013
Hugo," A Movie for Movie-Lovers!
","The legendary director Martin Scorcese decided to try his hand at a children's film and did he ever succeed. Not only is Hugo a well-made, beautiful children's film, but it's about the preservation of old cinema. First off, this film is beautiful to look at. The cinematography and set designs are top-notch. This is one of the few films that 3D actually works with. The movie also has a great story which lead to a well-written script which then led to the casting of great actors who did such a fantastic job.This film, which is based on the novel 'The Invention of Hugo Cabret', is about an orphan boy who lives alone in a Paris train station and owns an automaton. He happens to be caught as a thief by a toy store owner, George Melies. The boy ends up meeting Isabelle and together they find out who the real George Melies is.This movie is filled with fantastic acting. Asa Butterfield and Chloe Grace Moretz are two young, fine actors. Ben Kingsley is perfect as Melies. Sacha Baren Cohen adds some old-fashioned comedy here and does it well. It's also nice to see character actors like Christopher Lee and Richard Griffiths here.Overall, this is a great homage on cinema. I became interested in the history of cinema thanks to this film. The final half-hour of this film is no doubt the best part as we see Hollywood paying respect for this guy. This is a beautiful film that deserves all the positive attention. I rate this film 10/10.",10,7,13,28 May 2013
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," Worthy Sequel!
","Terminator 3 is definitely a worthy addition to the Terminator series. I was not looking forward to watching this movie because of the many negative reviews this movie got. Well, I certainly enjoyed this film. Terminator 3 may even be better than the first two and they were masterpieces.This time around John Connor is in his early 20's. A machine comes from the future to protect both him and his future wife from a female killing robot.The acting is pretty good. I was surprised that Edward Furlong did not come back. But I have to say Nick Stahl impressed me. Of course the great action star Arnold is darn near perfect in his last leading role.The special effects were really great. I liked the fact that some good comedy was added into the plot. I liked the score by Beltrami too.Overall, this is a great film. I wouldn't listen to the critics. I rate this film 9/10.",9,0,0,27 January 2011
Doctor Zhivago," Beautiful Piece Of Art!
","Doctor Zhivago is one of the last true epics to ever be filmed. This film came during a time period where there were hardly any special effects and where films mainly use humans/real-life characters to tell the narrative. This wonderful film is a sweeping, majestic beauty that tells a love story amidst one of the most famous historical revolutions of modern times; the Russian Revolution of 1917. Boasting an excellent score by Maurice Jarre as well as amazing, sweeping cinematography, Doctor Zhivago is a film that everyone should watch because this is how you make a film.David Lean's historical epic, set during the Russian Revolution, is essentially a love story between an army doctor who was drafted named Zhivago and a beautiful, young girl named Lara.This film has plenty of stars and it consistently relies on human power to tell this story and does so effectively. Omar Sharif does an excellent job in the title role and you like his character because he is sentimental to a fault and in general tries to be the best man he can be. Julie Christie is marvelous as Lara. Alec Guinness, while not shown much is effective in his role as Zhivago's half-brother. Rod Steiger also does a very good job in his role. Finally, I noticed that Charlie Chaplin's daughter is in this film and she does a pretty decent job.Overall, this is a majestic film that will be sure to knock you off your feet. However, this film is not perfect. The film is at a very time-consuming 200 minutes and sometimes I felt the story may have dragged on a bit. I also had an issue with the very last scene and it does not work well in the large context of the story and it seemed rushed. Other than that, this is a work of art and one that should be shown in film classes for the rest of eternity. I rate this film 9/10.",9,1,2,25 January 2014
U-571," Entertaining!
","U-571 is a very entertaining movie that takes place during World War Two. I had to see his film because I like all movies that take place during WW2 historically accurate or not. This movie isn't historically accurate at all but I am writing this review as a movie, not on whether its truth or lies.This is about how a group of American sailors take over a Nazi U-boat and disguise themselves as Nazis so they can capture the Enigma.The acting is pretty good. I haven't seen much of Matthew McConaughey but I liked him here. Harvey Keitel is a nice asset too. The appearance of Jon Bon Jovi surprised me though.This movie produces tons of action and thrills. The last half hour really had me on my toes.Overall, this is a pretty good movie. I just wish people could see this as a movie. I rate this film 8/10.",8,1,4,25 February 2011
The Shining," A Fine Horror Film!
","Stanley Kubrick's The Shining is a work of art. I am not a big horror fan, so I generally stay away from them. But, I could not resist the great reviews, an excellent director, and Jack Nicholson. This movie blends the horror elements and a dramatic storyline together effectively and that is why this movie works.The Shining is about a guy named Jack Torrance who moves in with his family in the Overlook hotel since he will be working there as a caretaker. But little do they know that an evil awaits them in the hotel...Jack Nicholson is definitely at his best in this film. This could be is best role he ever played. He is effective and scary as Jack Torrance. However, I hated the character played by Shelley Duvall. I just found her to be annoying.Apparently, Stephen King was disappointed with this movie. I will admit that this movie does not follow the book closely and it's my favorite King book. But that aside, this is a very effective horror film and may be one of the best ever. I rate this film 9/10.",9,0,3,27 April 2012
"I, Robot"," A thrilling sci-fi film!
","I, Robot is a great film for normal people and sci-fi nerds alike. The story takes place in the future where humans and robots are living together. There is one cop, Spooner who dislikes robots. He believes that a certain robot killed its inventor. Now Spooner has to stop a revolution or else mankind is in jeopardy. The acting in this film is great. I always liked Will Smith, but he is better than usual in this action-packed spectacle. The other actors were good and convincing. The screenplay is written well though not to the point of Isaac Asimov. All the other aspects of this film is great and nothing is done wrong. I rate this film a 10/10.",10,1,2,23 July 2008
American Beauty," Film-Making At It's Best!
","American Beauty has just made my top ten list of all-time favorite movies. I have rarely seen a movie that has such masterful filmmaking and one that plays with all your emotions all so perfectly during the running time of two hours. This is a perfect satire on American life and on the life of an ordinary family. What I liked is none of these characters are the villains, but they all are shown to have flaws and yearn for better things in life. This movie has the perfect balance of humor and drama and I was surprised how funny some scenes were.This film happens to be the theatrical debut of Sam Mendes and he directed one dandy of a film. His film takes a look on the life of the Burnham family. This film looks at the dwindling marriage of Lester and Carolyn Burnham and the relationship of their daughter and the son of their new neighbor. There is also the relationship of that son and his father which is quite intense.In order for a film like this to work, there must be marvelous acting. Kevin Spacey is a very gifted actor and he is the perfect guy for Lester. He truly gives a powerful performance from the moment his voice over starts at the beginning of the film. Annette Bening gives a great performance as Carolyn. I also loved Chris Cooper as the military neighbor. His scenes were intense to say the very least.Overall, this is one of the best movies I have ever seen. This is somewhat of a satire, but realism is integrated in the movie. I loved the camera work in the film especially when the red flower petals are floating during some scenes. This is a true 90's masterpiece and I was hooked from the beginning to the end. These characters aren't bad people, but they were trying to have a better life and that I sympathize with them. I rate this film 10/10.",10,0,3,17 March 2013
The Alamo," Hugely Underrated Film!
","The Alamo is a vast, smartly-told historical epic that is way better than people give it credit for. It's a shame this film is widely known as one of the biggest box office failures in the history of cinema because this is a much better film than that. It describes a history lesson that is significant in our American history and one that features some very courageous heroes who sacrificed themselves for the good of our country.John Lee Hancock's film tells the story of the fall of the Alamo. As Santa Anna's army is crusading in Texas and converging upon Fort Alamo, several hundred men including the famous Davey Crockett are preparing their defenses to fight Anna's army as they wait for reinforcements from General Sam Houston.A cast like this shouldn't have been strong as it is and that impressed me the most. Dennis Quaid did a decent job as Sam Houston, but I feel like Billy Bob Thornton had one of his best roles of his career as Davey Crockett. He had many brilliant scenes and my favorite is when he was serenading both the Americans and the Mexicans with the fiddle.Overall, the Alamo is a very good history lesson. If nothing else, this movie is set to inspire people about the history and the odds these heroes had to overcome. There are some pacing and editing issues here and it's unfortunate Hancock had to cut out lots of footage because sometimes the story seems to be uneven. But also, this features one of the best scores that Carter Burwell has done. All-in-all, this is a great film and much better than the general consensus. I rate this film 8/10.",8,6,6,3 May 2014
Wanted," Just Another Action Movie!
","Wanted is just another action movie out there to entertain the summer audiences. There are some new elements added to this film but most of it is what we would expect and that's a good thing. There are also some Matrix elements that were incorporated into this film.This movie is about a guy named Wesley who finds out that he is the son of a superassassin. Now Wesley has to follow in his own father's footsteps.The acting is good. I felt like James McAvoy's character is a bit of a dweeb though. Angelina Jolie is very good-looking as always. It's also nice to see Morgan Freeman play the villain. You don't see that too much.Overall, this is a solid action film with tons of action, great sets, and just a good old time. I rate this film 8/10.",8,1,2,23 July 2012
Warrior," Excellent, Powerful Film!
","Despite many clichÃ©s we have come to see in sports movies, I can't help but love this movie, Warrior. I find this film to be a tad better than 2010's The Fighter, another great movie. I find it a crime that this movie was overlooked by moviegoers and the Academy. Why it did so poor at the box office is beyond me. I saw this film knowing what it was and I was rewarded with a tense sports drama that features many important themes on family and hard work.Gavin O'Connor's film is about two brothers who haven't spoken to each other in years because of family issues and they both sign up to fight in the MMA tournament. Will these brothers make up or will they be out to hurt one another. They also have to deal with their father who is a recovering alcoholic.The acting is very good in the film. Tom Hardy and Joel Edgerton are great actors despite them only being B-list stars. They were really good, Edgerton more than Hardy. Nick Nolte fits the role of the alcoholic father just perfectly as we see him play another gritty role with his trademark growling.Overall, this is a very powerful film that is more about brotherhood than the fighting itself. However, the fights were perfectly executed and gleefully violent. I understand that this movie has almost every clichÃ© that have been used in the past and is very predictable, but I find that if these clichÃ©s are executed properly, it doesn't matter. I rate this film 10/10.",10,3,5,25 April 2013
Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa," The First One is Better....The Second is Still Good!
","I enjoyed watching Madagascar. That movie was funny and original. That made me look forward to the second movie. I thought that the sequel would be better, but I was somewhat let down. This movie is still a very good better, but the first film is better.In this movie, the main characters are on their way to New York City when their plane crashes. The animals join up with a wild herd with hilarious results. Alex even get to see his parents again.The characters in this movie are funny. The penguins are still the best. Alex and Gloria still did great. I was slightly disappointed Marty. I liked him better in the first film. Even the old lady was funny acting like the boss of the jungle.The animation is great, something that I would expect of Pixar. The music is pretty good because it is done by Hans Zimmer and a member of the Black Eyed Peas.This movie is for more grown-up kids. I certainly enjoyed this film. I rate this film 8/10.",8,0,2,14 February 2009
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," Awesome!
","Terminator 2 is a worthy sequel to the first one. I think I like this film more than the original. With these films, James Cameron proved himself to be an adept director. He made the top two grossing films all time in America and three films that defined science fiction/action for ages to come.The Terminator returns this time not as a bad guy but as the good guy. His mission is to protect the son of Sarah Connor, John. Together they must rescue Sarah from the mental hospital and save the lives of three billion people.It's nice to see Arnold return. He knows how to kick butt. Robert Patrick is quite the villain. I hated his guts.Overall, this is one of the best movies from the 1990's. It also broke new ground visually. I rate this film 9/10. Hasta la Vista, Baby!",9,4,5,26 January 2011
Salt," Great Popcorn Movie!
","Salt is a very good action movie and the plot actually scared me somewhat. It occurred to me that this is a possibility that any country could do to America in the future. But this movie also proves why Angelina Jolie is the best female action star in the movie business. She's hot and she knows how to kick serious butt.This movie is about a CIA operative who is named as a Russian spy by a captured Russian guy. Now she's on the run avoiding the authorities as she attempts to clear her name.I said before that Angelina Jolie kicks butt and I wanted to say that again. I been a fan of hers since the first Tomb Raider. Liev Schreiber did a pretty good job as well.This movie is just one of those action movies with a great plot twist. It won't win any Oscars and it's not the best movie of they year. This is just for pure entertainment.Overall, this is a solid action movie. I hope to see Jolie back in action soon. I rate this film 9/10.",9,19,27,6 January 2011
We're the Millers," Surprisingly Funny!
","I thought We're the Millers was going to be another one of those stale road-trip comedies, but actually you can take the word stale out of the equation. It has a bashful, mean-spirited undertone, but the jokes work so well and this is the case where they are so mean, but so funny. A certain spider joke comes to mind. I also liked the concept of the film. Strangers working together to show themselves as a family to the public is a good topic to work on. I really enjoyed the film and to be honest, I would not say no to a sequel.Rawson Marshall Thurber's film is about a low-level drug dealer named David Clark who is assigned to travel to Mexico and smuggle marijuana. In order to keep suspicion away, David realizes he should travel with a 'family.' He gathers his stripper neighbor, Rose, a homeless thief named Casey, and his virgin neighbor, Kenny to be his fake family for the road.This film has a good cast and I think everyone had good, natural chemistry. Jason Sudeikis is often a mean guy, but is naturally funny. Jennifer Aniston is sexy hot in her role and is one of her better roles as of late. Emma Roberts is a good cast and is probably her raciest role to date. Finally, Will Poulter does a good job as he is the butt of my favorite jokes.Overall, We're the Millers is your modern, typical R-rated comedy but it's hilarious and the jokes work more often than not. I was surprised at the outcome, and I never thought I would be calling this the funniest film of Summer 2013. But indeed it was. From that spider joke to another joke involving lots of kissing, I really could not stop laughing. I rate this film 9/10.",9,2,5,18 November 2014
Apocalypse Now," Epic Film of Great Proportions!
","This movie is a very powerful movie filled with messages about the Vietnam War. This movie was a classic in 1979 and still is a classic thirty one years later. I heard some reviews about the redux version and how it sucked but I think it did not suck. It was somewhat long, but it was powerful and I was sucked in.This is about Captain Willard who has been assigned to travel up a river and assassinate the colonel.The acting is marvelous. I loved the great performances by Martin Sheen, Robert Duvall, Harrison Ford, and of course the great Marlon Brando.I read that this movie was very tough to film and the cast and crew had to endure hardships. It's amazing that this movie was even released. I definitely have to give them credit for that.Overall, this is one of the best movies from the 1970's and it will always remain a classic. I rate this film 9/10.",9,0,1,28 October 2010
Disturbia," Creepiness At It's Best!
","Disturbia is one excellent, but creepy film. I am not a big fan of movies with horror elements but I had to check this film out based on rave reviews, good storyline, and likable cast. To say the least, this film has made me more interested in the thriller/horror genre. This is film is about a teenager named Kale. He is placed under house arrest and he decides to use his time to spy on his neighbors. He discovers that one of his neighbors is not the peaceful neighbor he claims to be. The acting is very good and better than what I expected. Shia LaBeouf really plays the central role quite well. Carrie-Ann Moss does a great job in her limited time on screen. But the best actor of the bunch has to be David Morse as the creepy neighbor. D.J Caruso made a really good film thats a welcome addition to the thriller genre. He also blended in some comedy to go with the thrills and chills. Overall, this a very good film! It works because it loaded me up with suspense during the whole movie. I rate this film 9/10.",9,1,3,13 April 2012
The Patriot," Very Good War Movie!
","I think this is the first film on the Revolutionary War that I have seen. This is an excellent film, a film that deserves better than a 6.9 on the rating system. Mel Gibson and Heath Ledger have very memorable characters. I would say this is Ledger's best movie after his thrilling performance in the Dark Knight.Gibson is Benjamin Martin, a hero from the French and Indian War. He wants nothing to do with the current war. But when his son enlists, Benjamin decides he must protect and family and fight for his country.The acting is very good. As I mentioned before, Gibson and Ledger have Oscar-like performances. Jason Isaacs is fantastic as the bad guy just like the Harry Potter movies.This is a great movie that could make many people emotional. The music by John Williams is very good and memorable. This is one of the better war movies of all time. I rate this film 10/10.",10,0,6,8 July 2010
Edward Scissorhands," Excellent Masterpiece!
","Edward Scissorhands is a wonderful masterpiece. I saw this film long before I saw any other Johnny Depp films. As usual, Tim Burton did a great job with the gifted cast. This film stars Johnny Depp as a invented person with scissors for hands. He was invented by an old inventor. As soon as Edward is about to receive his hands, the inventor dies. Soon after, a woman played by Dianne Wiest takes him to her house where he learns about everything from banks to the woman's daughter. Everything works out perfectly until Edward hurts the son. He eventually was kicked out of the town with everyone assuming that he's dead. As I said above, the acting was gifted and magical. Everyone did a good job. This is also Vincent Price's last film. The scenery was great and I liked the plant shapes the Edward was cutting. My only bad thought is that the score was a bit bland. I recommend this film to everyone over the age of 12 and I rate this film a 9/10.",9,1,2,14 April 2008
Silver Linings Playbook," Wonderful Film!
","Silver Linings Playbook is an incredible film that brings to the light the subject of bipolar disorders, one of the rare films to do so. This film is so sweet and sentimental in one way, but in another way we get to see the dark side of bipolar disorders which results in extreme mood swings. But this film features an incredible screenplay that touches up on all the emotions, fantastic acting that uses the screenplay with heart and soul, excellent directing by David O. Russell, and just a compelling story about a disorder that affects many people worldwide.O'Russell directed a film about a guy named Patrick who has just been released from a mental hospital and he moved back in with his parents. He also has a goal of reuniting with his wife despite a big incident that occurred between them. While pursuing his goals, he meets Tiffany whom ultimately has a dark past and problems of her own.This film is a haven for acting because the acting here is just incredible. The chemistry between everyone is just top-notch and it's clear that everyone was very involved with the film. Jennifer Lawrence is just amazing and she clearly steals every scene she's in and she deserves her Best Actress win. She shows awesome chemistry with Bradley Cooper, who comes into his own this movie. Cooper shows lots of range by taking this role and this was a risk that paid off handsomely. Robert De Niro gives his best role in years and Jacki Weaver does a great job as well.Overall, Silver Linings Playbook is just an excellent film that is not only funny, but is deeply touching. The first hour and fifteen minutes are the best, while the final half goes through the conventional romance stage, but it's very much worth watching thanks to the excellent acting. It's well-written, well-acted, and one of the best drama films of the year. I rate this film 9/10.",9,1,5,18 May 2014
Van Helsing," Interesting Movie!
","Through the first half hour of the film, I could not tell if I was going to like or hate this film. It has such a great premise but the execution for the first part was horrid. Not to mention that the guy who played Dracula was horrible. Then for the final hour and a half, I enjoyed the movie.If you like the old horror movies from the 1930's, you will certainly like this. It's about Van Helsing, the vampire hunter whose mission is to kill Dracula.Hugh Jackman and Kate Beckinsale were the highlights of the film. They are both talented actors. However, I though Richard Roxburgh was miscast as Dracula. He played a pretty bad Dracula.Overall, this is a pretty good special-effects laden film. Is it worthy of an 8? I don't think so but I gave it one to bring the overall IMDb rating up.",8,5,9,31 December 2011
Divergent," Another Good Franchise Starter!
","To be quite frank, I enjoyed Divergent. I tried to read the book, but I was never able to finish reading the book. The movie is a better movie than I thought. I honestly don't get the comparisons between this and the Hunger Games other than the dystopian futures and a strong, female protagonist. They are both different stories and I enjoy each movie for different reasons. This movie doesn't feature strong romance and I like the fact how there are factions based off virtues, which I find intriguing. There are some cool action scenes and I also enjoyed the pretty effective visuals. Neil Burger's film is about a girl named Tris Prior who was assigned to the Dauntless faction, or pretty much the army of the city. She has a dark secret in which she is divergent, or the ability to have all virtues. The government has a plan to wipe out all Divergents and Tris, along with the mysterious Four, must figure out why and how to stop them. I believe that the cast did an excellent job. Shailene Woodley is a good, young actress and she played her role very well. Theo James actually made for a good Four and of course all the girls would be all over him. Jai Courtney, whom was bad in the last adaptation of Die Hard, delivers a stronger performance as the leader of Dauntless. Kate Winslet gives a malicious performance as the head government leader. Other standouts include Miles Teller and Ashley Judd. Overall, Divergent is the beginning of what seems to be another profitable, young-adult franchise. I love the nature of the film and it is a better movie than book, which is often very rare. I was able to understand the concepts, thus making me more appreciative of them. Is this the best young-adult movie? Of course not, but I regard highly the value of it being fun and entertaining. I cannot way to see this story continue. My Grade: A-",9,1,5,4 March 2015
Ender's Game," A Faithful Book Adaptation!
","Ender's Game is a rather faithful adaptation from the source material, well about as faithful one could hope for. The book itself is a very conceptual book and I was pleased many of the themes were prevalent in the movie. Themes on friendship and war are the biggest themes on display here. The visuals are fantastic and it shows how far the visual effects game has gone. The battle room, which features zero gravity, rendered me speechless at the awe of the film.Gavin Hood's film is based off this kid named Ender Wiggins, who is prone to reactive violence and possess the skills of a fearless leader, according to Colonel Graff. He is also very fond of his sister. Ender finally gets accepted to Battle School, where he is trained to become a leader. One that will follow in the footsteps of Mazer Rackham in defeating the Formics, a group of genocidal aliens bent on destroying Earth.The film has a very strong cast and they do well. Asa Butterfield wasn't exactly the Ender my mine pictured, but he did blow me away. Harrison Ford returns to his sci-fi roots as Colonel Graff and he does excellent, especially when he belittles Ender. Hailee Steinfeld does very well as one of Ender's few friends, Petra. We also get solid performances from the veterans Ben Kingsley and Viola Davis.Overall, Ender's Game is a very good movie with very conceptual themes remaining intact. 2013 was a very strong year for science fiction and fantasy films, and the film continues that trend in a positive direction. The movie, in addition to having a strong story, has excellent visuals. The battle scenes are very well-done. As a YA-adaptation, the film works more of an action movie and that is always a good thing in my book. I would love to see more of Ender as he faces the aftermath of the respective Battle and Command Schools. I rate this film 9/10.",9,2,4,31 December 2014
The White Ribbon," A Frustratingly Great Film!
","The White Ribbon is one of the most frustrating and antagonizing movies I have ever seen. But on the other hand, the film consists of sheer beauty from the story within and from the amazing black and white cinematography which adds authenticity to the film. This film moves at a snail-pace and is consequently devoid of thrilling action, but the story is very captivating and the lesson is simple: negative, authoritarian leadership will lead to negative, possibly devastating consequences.Austrian filmmaker Michael Haneke directs a film that takes place leading up the first World War. The location is a baron's land which consists of a doctor, schoolteacher, and so on. But one day, these mysterious events occur which results in injuries and even deaths of townsfolk. Now as they are trying to find answers, nothing can happen without drawing suspicion.The acting is very good. Christian Friedel does a great job as the young teacher who is witnessing these events and is trying to find answers which is proving tough as he is trying to marry his prospective fiancée. I also have to mention Burghart KlauBner as the preacher. He was very tough and is a man you can't look down upon.Overall, The White Ribbon is a serious look about the root of evil and it is known for depicting society and family life on the dark side. This film essentially shows the evils or we shall say the roots of Nazism and Fascism which would rise to power less than two decades after the events of this film. This film is the meaning of beauty, technically and story-wise, but is also a very frustrating film and it is very hard to watch due to the tepid place. But it is a case study on human society, so it's well worth watching. I rate this film 8/10.",8,1,4,13 September 2014
Monsters vs. Aliens," Colbert Makes a Fine President!
","I really enjoyed watching Monsters vs Aliens even though many people said it sucked. Well, this is not Pixar or Ice Age or Shrek. This is just a good animated feature that parents and kids should have a good time watching. I know I had fun watching this film especially Colbert as the American President. His scenes are definitely the funniest part of the movie.This is about a group of monsters who take on Gallaxhar and his clones. Gallaxhar is about to destroy Earth because he's looking for a rare, powerful mineral. But that mineral is inside the body of Susan Murphy and that enabled her to become gigantic and strong.The voice acting is great. This movie features an all-star cast such as Reese Witherspoon, Seth Rogen, and Kiefer Sutherland.I know this is a predictable movie. I know this is not Dreamworks best because Shrek is. But, it works out well because I liked it. I rate this film 9/10.",9,1,2,6 July 2010
Save the Last Dance," Dance, Dance, Dance!
","Normally, I try to stay away from movies that are just about dancing. The one exception for this moment is this film, Save the Last Dance. The movie is more than just dancing, it is a human story that explores themes such as passion, family tragedy, and interracial love. I found the latter part interesting because it is relatively uncommon to see in movies and I thought that part in the movie worked very well. As for the dancing, it's not too bad and the choreography is halfway decent. Thomas Carter's film is about a girl named Sara who dreams to be a ballerina are shattered when an unfortunate family tragedy occurs and she is forced to move to the other side of town, where the town is predominantly black. Sara is able to befriend Chenille, whom in turn introduces her to her brother, Derek. Together, Sara and Derek work together to help Sara train for a dance audition for Jubilee. The acting was not too bad. Julia Stiles handled the dramatic part effectively, although I'm not sure if she makes for a talented dancer, especially in hip-hop dance. Sean Patrick Thomas does a solid job as Derek and I really liked Kerry Washington in her role as Chenille. Overall, Save the Last Dance is nowhere close to a great movie, but it does have some entertaining moments. In particular, the dance moments are quite effective, although not perfect. The drama was handled well and I quite liked the beginning of the film the best, although the narrative seems to stumble midway. This is not a bad film though. My Grade: B-",8,1,3,3 April 2015
Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters," Surpassed My Low Expectations!
","Before viewing this movie, I knew it was not going to be a masterpiece. I already had incredibly low expectations for it and I thought I was going to hate it. After viewing it, I can say it's a pretty bad....ass film. It's not a great film, but it's ridiculously entertaining and even really funny. There's lots of gore here, so people who love endless CGI blood will fall in love with this film.Tommy Wirkola's film adds some more depth to the classic tale from the Grimm Brothers, Hansel and Gretel. This story explores their adult lives, where of course they would become witch hunters. They usually get the job done, but then there is this witch who believes she is the most powerful of all.The acting is good and it seems like everyone had a blast. Jeremy Renner as Hansel was good and the funniest of the siblings. Gemma Arterton is certainly very sexy as Gretel. Peter Stormare makes for a hard-nosed chief and Famke Janssen relishes her role as the evil witch.Overall, I must admit that I had a blast with Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters. The story is not anywhere to be seen, but I wasn't in the mood for any in-depth story. I just wanted to see witches die, and I think I can say my wish was fulfilled. This is an action-packed horror film that will take you for a thrilling ride. I rate this film 8/10.",8,19,24,2 June 2014
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," Thought-Provoking Thriller!
","The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is the Americanized version based off the original Swedish trilogy. I haven't seen those films, but after watching this mesmerizing thriller by David Fincher, I might have to check them out. The general consensus I hear is that this is a necessary remake and there are some differences. This film is dark, thought-provoking, and features two very unique characters. In other words, this is typical David Fincher.This film is about how a journalist Mikael Blomkvist along with hacker Lisbeth Salander investigate what happened to this woman who disappeared many years previously.Daniel Craig and Rooney Mara bring this film to an elite level. I never thought Rooney Mara could pull of this role but somehow she did. Everything from that haircut to her personality, she became Lisbeth. She also has the best redemption scene you will ever see. Daniel Craig is really grim but interesting as Mikael.Overall, this is a dark thriller with quite a few twists. I couldn't see these twists coming from a mile away. There are some very violent scenes including visually-explicit rape scene but they work well with the content. This film also has very good editing which it won an Oscar. The screenplay is also very good and it has very fresh dialog. I didn't expect much out of the film, but David Fincher made this work. I rate this film 9/10.",9,2,9,8 June 2013
In the Name of the Father," Powerful Performances!
","If you ever wanted a tutorial on perfect acting, In the Name of the Father is the perfect film to turn to. This is a very powerful film that features perhaps some of the best acting of the 1990's. This is a film, although somewhat historically inaccurate, will make viewers weep at times and cheer for the characters at other times. I have rarely seen a movie so powerful and uplifting but heart-wrenching as well.Jim Sheridan's film is about the Guilford Four and how they were wrongfully implicated by the British for an IRA bombing. The supposed leader, Gerry Conlon is sent to life in prison and is joined by his father. Together, for the next fifteen years, they do what they can to prove they're innocent and gain their freedom.Daniel-Day Lewis. Just reading that name aloud gives me goosebumps. He is the greatest actor of our generation if not the best of all time. He gives another masterful performance as Gerry Conlon. He is truly the best method actor I have ever seen. Pete Postlethwaite gives the strongest performance of his career as Gerry's caring but stern father. Emma Thompson doesn't have much screen time until the end but her screen time is well worth the wait.Overall, this is one of the best films of a decade that features some of the best film-making in cinema history. I'm glad to say this film would have joined their ranks. Even the most stern grouch would be in tears at the end of the film. I feel bad that Daniel did not take home the Oscar for the film even though Tom Hanks deserves it for his performance in Philadelphia. I rate this film 10/10.",10,0,1,14 March 2013
The 40-Year-Old Virgin," Pretty Funny!
","I think this was the movie that changed comedies and the way we see them now. Ever since this movie, there have been comedies similar to this that came out and I pretty much liked them all. But this is the one that started it all. Steve Carell also got famous due to this movie.This is about what the title says. It's about a 40-year-old who never had sex before and is afraid to commit. But things get interesting when he sees the love of his life. Also he has to deal with crazy crap from his co worker buddies.The acting is pretty good. Steve Carell was pretty funny and I loved the chest waxing scene. I also enjoyed the performances of Seth Rogen and Paul Rudd.Overall, I thought this was a decent comedy. They made better over the next few years but this was still a good one. I rate this film 8/10.",8,0,1,21 October 2010
Face_Off," Fun Action Movie!
","This is what I call a breakthrough film in the action genre. Before 1997, there have been many excellent action movies. But John Woo and special effects brought something more to the table. I have not seen such a grand action movie before 1997, the year this movie was released.This is about an FBI agent, Sean Archer whose life mission is to track down his nemesis, Castor Troy for personal reasons. And that involves him and Castor switching bodies.Nicolas Cage was on a hot streak in the late 90's starring in the Rock, Con Air, and now this. He should play the villain more often. John Travolta did a pretty awesome job too.The action is fantastic. John Woo gave this film plenty of action which I came to expect from him. The score is wonderful too. I think this is John Powell's first feature film.Overall, this is a great movie. I also loved the boots the prisoners had to wear in the prison. I think that's cool. I rate this film 9/10.",9,1,1,13 August 2011
The Men Who Stare at Goats," Quirky But Enjoyable!
","Over the years, George Clooney been in many great movies such as the Ocean series, The Perfect Storm, Burn After Reading, now this. This isn't his best movie but it's definitely better than Batman and Robin. I would classify this film to be within the same realm of Burn After Reading. They're both good, quirky comical satires.This movie is about a guy named Bob who is looking for a story. He learns from Lyn that there's a branch in the army that deals with supernatural powers. Bob decides to go to the Middle East and investigate.Now, I find that not all people will like this movie. My mother couldn't watch the whole movie because she said it was boring. I think you must have an imaginative mind to enjoy this film. The acting here is brilliant. Jeff Bridges is a very good actor and helps this film earn an 8.Overall, this is a good movie. By the way, don't be fooled by Ewan McGregor and his Jedi talk. This is not Star Wars. I rate this film 8/10.",8,0,2,3 July 2010
Spider-Man," Fantastic!
","The Spider Man trilogy is one of those superhero films that rivals the first two Batman movies for the best superhero movies of the 21st century. The first one really sets the tone for the whole trilogy. I really enjoyed this film. I wish that I saw in theaters then I could have enjoyed it better.This movie is about the origins of Spider Man and how Peter Parker transformed into the web-slinging superhero. The villain, The Green Goblin, is about to show Spider Man who's the real man.The acting is pretty good. I just wanted to punch Tobey Maguire because he is an absolute nerd but he was all right. Kirsten Dunst is perfect as Mary Jane Watson.When I saw some scenes here I was reminded of Spider Pig in the Simpsons Movie. That made me enjoy the movie more.Overall, this is a fantastic movie. There are great special effects and the music by Danny Elfman is wonderful. I rate this film 10/10.",10,0,1,4 December 2010
Jarhead," Not Bad, But Is This A War or Drama Movie?
","I think that Jarhead is a good movie. I really cannot call this a war film because there is no fighting and no war deaths. What I can call this is a drama. This movie plays out as a good drama that will provoke some emotions.This is a non fiction story that tells the life of Anthony Swofford during his boot camp time and his time overseas at Kuwait. He and his troops are waiting for war, but they never get the chance.The acting is pretty good. I liked Jake Gyllenhaal as Swofford. He is a believable character. Jamie Foxx and Peter Sarsgaard are even better and they should deserve an Oscar nomination. I liked Evan Jones character, Fowler.The one thing that is confusing is the pace of the movie. One moment, the soldiers just enter the war. The next moment, the war is over and everyone is celebrating. I did not see that coming.Sam Mendes does a great job directing this movie. I enjoyed most of it. I rate this movie 8/10.",8,1,1,13 February 2009
Shrek Forever After," Mindless Entertainment!
",I actually liked this movie better than I thought it would be. I really enjoyed the first three so I didn't know what to expect with the fourth one. U think this movie is the weakest one of the series but I still enjoyed it very much. I even though the trailer for this looked lame.Shrek is getting annoyed about how is family life is. He wishes for one day he can be a real ogre again. He meets the Rumpelstiltskin and he grants Shrek's wish. However all the creatures he knows don't exist anymore and he has 24 hours to set everything right.Well we all know what to expect from the voice actors. Eddie Murphy as Donkey still gave me quite a few laughs.This movie is perfect on the way it ended the series. It's by means not even close to perfect but it was still enjoyable. I rate this film 8/10.,8,1,1,10 December 2010
Collateral," Dazzling and Stunning Thriller!
","This is one of the best thrillers I have seen this decade. I found it impossible to pause the film to get a drink every once in awhile. This movie was even nominated for two Academy Awards. I could've gotten more.This film is about a assassin named Vincent who has been assigned to kill five people due to legal troubles. Vincent hires a taxi driver with a big dream to take him around to these killing stops. That changes Max's life dramatically.The acting is very good. Tom Cruise is back but this time as the bad guy. Jamie Foxx is a superb job as the babbling taxi driver.There are many plot twists in the film. When I expected something to happen, it seems like the opposite always happens. I give kudos to the screenwriters.Michael Mann did a great job. It's ironic that the movie I saw before this one was his 1992's Last of the Mohicans.Overall, this is a great thriller that stands out. I rate this film 10/10.",10,0,1,15 March 2009
Dark City," Awesome Sci-Fi!
","I can see all the comparisons this film get towards the Matrix, but Dark City came out first and it happens to be the better film. It's dark, brooding, and often philosophic. There are many weighty themes regarding the human mind and it basically asks the question, what is reality? The CGI, for it's time, was pretty good. The metropolis this film takes place in reminds me of Gotham City from 1989's Batman. The script is well-polished and for the most part, the acting is great.Alex Proyas directs a film about a guy named John Murdoch who awakens with fragmented memories with the only memories of his wife and a place named Shell Beach. He is chased by a detective who believes he is a murderer and by these beings known as The Strangers who have the ability to stop time and alternate reality.The acting is pretty good for the most part. Rufus Sewell is solid as John Murdoch and makes his character very believable. Jennifer Connelly is also pretty good as his wife. William Hurt is a great actor and it's no different in this movie. My only issue came with Kiefer Sutherland. It took me awhile to warm up to his character, but in the end I was able to come to terms with him.Overall, Dark City is a great sci-fi films that have many elements of film-noir. It's dark and brooding film and one can even go far out to call it unforgiving. I liked the visuals and I really liked the concepts of the movie. Even though it's not horror, this film can be scary at times. I rate this film 9/10.",9,2,4,7 June 2014
The Machinist," Thrilling and Complex!
","The Machinist is a well-crafted thriller with one of those usual(but well-done and surprising) twist endings. This low-budget movie is just worth watching for Christian Bale's performance alone as he totally transformed himself and lost sixty pounds for this role. Now that is commitment at it's finest. The overall look of the film is bleak and dismal with grayish colors. That is what we see because we view the world from the main character's eyes and we can effectively see his emotions and feelings through them.Brad Anderson's film is about a factory worker named Trevor who hasn't been asleep in over a year. He causes an accident at work due to a sighting of someone who no one else can see and from there, his life begins to unravel even more as his paranoia increases.As I mentioned above, Christian Bale is amazing. He takes a gritty role and brings it to a whole new level. I have never seen such dedication to a role as Bale did. This is one of those films where only one main actor is needed and Bale definitely came through.Overall, this is a tense thriller that clearly explains the negative effects of insomnia. I liked the ending as it really closed the film in a high note. However, I couldn't help but feel a little disappointed. I expected a 10/10 film based off what everyone told me but while this film is very good, it's not great. I admire all the craft that went into a low-budget film like this but I found it really slow at times. But it's still an above-average film. I rate this film 8/10.",8,0,0,25 March 2013
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," A Good Potter Film, But Not The Best!
","Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is a fabulous movie for entertainment but a teeny disappointment for avid HP book readers like myself. This time around, Harry enters his third year and he must deal with an escaped convict who is seemingly after Harry. The acting in this film is better than the first two. As the main actors(Radcliffe, Grint,and Watson)grow up, their abilities seem to improve. The supporting actors were good, but they needed a bit more screen time. Also, it's nice to see normal clothing instead of robes. The new director, Cuaron did a good job. He added a different style into this film. The music by the famous John Williams is different, but good. Finally, some sub-plots were cut out. I wished to see Harry and his win of the Quidditch cup. Other than that, this movie is pretty good. I rate this film a 9/10.",9,1,2,29 June 2008
Ratatouille," Another Pixar Great!
","I have enjoyed every single Pixar movie that came out. I remember seeing the first Toy Story when it came out in theaters. I have not been disappointed with any of them, fifteen years later. I did hesitate to see this because I was skeptical of a movie about a rat who can cook.This movie is basically about that rat who has great culinary skills. He decides to help a young cleaner-turned-chef to be one of the greatest chefs Paris has seen.The voice cast is awesome. It seems like every animated movie there is, Brad Garrett is doing a role. I also noticed the great voice of Ian Holm.The animation is very good and that's because it's Pixar. I'm happy that I saw this because it's already a classic. I rate this movie 9/10.",9,0,1,28 September 2010
Bad Teacher," Goofy Fun!
","Bad Teacher is one of my guilty pleasures giving on how offensive to some people this movie can be. This reminded much of Bad Santa in the way of how we get to see that the usual normally good people can have bad people too. Despite some crude and offensive jokes, I found this movie to be quite hilarious. I didn't expect much from the trailers so I was pleasantly surprised when I reached the end of the movie.This film is about a teacher with really bad manners who is desperate for a breast job. She then goes all out against a rival teacher to do all she can to win the bonus even if it means breaking the law.Cameron Diaz isn't that bad actually. She does seem to have a gift for comedy. She still looks hot but we can see she's getting older. Jason Segel as always is good and heartwarming in his role. I loved Lucy Punch as the rival teacher. I didn't care much for Justin Timberlake. I thought his character was stupid and did not belong in the movie.Overall, this is a funny movie even if it tries to break barriers. It relies on the charisma of the actors to succeed which it mostly does. I loved the car wash scene because I thought it was kind of sexy. Easily the scene in the movie. I did think this movie had problems with the flow of the plot and some unexplained things plot-wise but in the end, it doesn't matter much. I rate this film 8/10.",8,2,5,28 February 2013
The Amazing Spider-Man," Exciting, Action-Packed Reboot,,,,,But Is It Worth It?
","Only five years after the universally-hated Spider-Man 3(not me, though), Columbia Pictures have decided to give Peter Parker and his alter ego, Spider-man a fresh start. This film is essentially quite similar to 2002's film, but also features a few differences mainly a personality change in Peter. I don't know if I like this film any better than the original trilogy. This film is action-packed, has a great cast, and a rather fun villain in 'The Lizard,' but this film doesn't live up to the trilogy that gave Spider-Man a name for himself.Marc Webb's film explores the origins of Spider-Man and also unlike the trilogy, we learn more about Peter's past including what happened to his family. As Peter is exploring his past, he is lead to his father's former partner who happens to be too smart for his own good. Also, Peter strikes a relationship with the daughter of the police captain, Gwen Stacy.The acting is really not too bad. An Andrew Garfield/Emma Stone pairing is not as good as the Maguire/Dunst pairing, but they still do very good and it's nice to see some cockiness in Peter's attitude instead of complete nerdiness. The Lizard, played wonderfully by Rhys Ifans, is a good villain to watch. The rest of the cast rounded out with Denis Leary, Martin Sheen, and Sally Field gives this film some starpower.Overall, this is definitely not a bad film and it's very entertaining. But we must ask ourselves, is this a necessary reboot? Honestly, I would rather have seen a Spider-Man 4, but who's to complain. This is a solid entry into the superhero genre despite really offering anything new. But hey I was entertained and that is all what matters. I rate this film 8/10.",8,62,90,28 January 2014
The Lego Movie," Everything Is Indeed Awesome!
","The Lego Movie is an innovative, fresh take on an animated feature. I would never guess that a movie with such a terrible premise and an excuse to sell more Legos would turn out to be such an entertaining, fun film. It has an infectious nature thanks to the rapid pace, involvement of some of our favorite characters, and the hit song, 'Everything Is Awesome.' The animation is brilliant and I liked the characterizations. Not every joke worked, but the majority thankfully did. Phil Lord's and Christopher Miller's film is about an ordinary citizen named Emmett who is now charged with saving the universe from the destruction of Lord Business after he is seen as the most extraordinary person in the world. The film has a great voice cast filled with likable actors. Nowadays, Chris Pratt is a major star and he has this movie to thank as it's the beginning for what is to come. Will Ferrell once again delivers a funny performance as the villainous Lord Business. We also get good voice acting from the likes of Elizabeth Banks, Liam Neeson, and Morgan Freeman. Overall, The Lego Movie is a clever film that is way better than every right it had to be. The pace may be intense for some, but it's such a lively, entertaining movie. It'a a shame the Oscars snubbed the movie, because it at least deserves a nomination for Best Animated Feature. Instead of being a film designed for commercialization, it turned out to be top-tier entertainment. Everything is indeed awesome! I rate this film 9/10.",9,0,2,9 February 2015
Aliens," Another Sci-Fi Classic!
","I was impressed at the original Aliens. There is no words to describe how much better this film is. Everything is nearly perfect with this film especially the aliens and the horror scenes.To see this movie, I recommend that you watch the the 1979 version first because the plot is a direct continuation of that movie. In Aliens, Ripley has been in hypersleep for 57 years. She is upset that her daughter is gone and even more because no one believes her tale. But, the company sends her with Marines to figure out what happened to the colonists on the original planet Ripley was on 57 years before. The plot and the characters will keep you in suspense.The acting is top-notch. Almost every actor gave excellent performances. Signourey Weaver still is powerful playing Ripley. I was impressed with Carrie Henn as she plays a girl that survived the alien attacks on the colonists. Bill Paxton was decent even if he was a bit whiny.The special effects and the action are great. The explosions are top-of-the-art(only for that time period). The visual effects are stunning. The action scenes are fun to watch. There is more action than the first film because we see that Ripley can kick some serious butt.The music by James Horner adds spice to the movie.Overall, this is a perfect sci-fi/horror film. I rate this movie 10/10.",10,8,13,30 December 2008
Dallas Buyers Club," Filled With Outstanding Performances!
","Dallas Buyer Club is a fantastic movie and it's further proof that the McConaissance is indeed real. This movie explores important themes regarding the relationships between homosexuals/transgender people and heterosexual people. The movie shows that we are just humans and it does not matter our preferences. The movie is filled with fantastic performances and underneath the rough exterior of the film, it has a heart. It knows how to pull the strings of our emotions as there are some incredibly powerful scenes. This movie is about the growth of human beings and how we can achieve the impossible if we try.Jean-Marc Vallee's film is based on the true story about a Texas cowboy named Ron Woodruff. He is diagnosed with HIV and he takes the news very hard. But with the help of a fellow HIV patient and a transgender named Ronny and a kind doctor named Eve, he decides to help him and fellow patients get proper treatment. The only problem is the FDA is the main enemy as they do not allow any of these drugs to be used. Now Woodruff must publicly battle the FDA to gain any hope of survival.This film features not one, but two landmark performances. Matthew McConaughey might have delivered the best performance of his life as the foul-mouthed Ron Woodruff. Throughout the film, we see how the character change and how he accepts people he normally wouldn't have, thanks to Matt's strong performance. Jared Leto makes a very mesmerizing return to the big screen as the transgender, Ronny. His performance is just so powerful and so sad. Jennifer Garner also delivers the goods as Dr. Eva.Overall, The Dallas Buyers Club is an incredible movie that takes place in a time where the AIDS crisis was at its height and everyone was racing to find a cure. Powered by two magnificent performances, this movie was a prime player for the awards season and luckily it got all the attention it deserved. It's funny how a film with such a small budget can reach great heights and soar above films with budgets ten times as much. This movie should serve as an inspiration for those fighting HIV or AIDS. This movie shows that we should never give up fighting, no matter the cost. I rate this film 9/10.",9,1,1,1 January 2015
The Fast and the Furious," Get Ready to Race!!!!!
","Since this movie came out, I had no intentions to see this. This movie looked like a dud in my eyes. But, since the fourth one came out with mainly positive reviews, I decided to take my chances. This is one of the better racing movies you will ever see. I enjoyed watching this film.This film is about street-racing. Basically, a undercover FBI agent hooks up with a street racing gang to find criminals and love. The thing is, he enjoys street racing more than being an agent.Tons of people are saying that the acting is terrible, but I disagree. Vin Diesel played what he does best, a macho guy, and Paul Walker did a really good job. I will also say that the two girls, Brewster and Rodriguez are hot.If you like hip-hop, you will like the music. You will feel your energy rate soar through the roof along with the transmission. Great effects, too.Overall, this is a much better movie than I anticipated. I rate this movie 10/10.",10,0,3,1 May 2009
Goon," A Very Pleasing Comedy!
","I'm not a hockey fan by any stretch of the imagination, but Goon is a really funny, heart-warming film despite the film being hockey-based. But then again, this is a Canadian movie so a hockey film from Canada is not surprising at all. But the film goes beyond the sport and into the realm of its characters. The film is mostly based off the characters and their relationships with each other. Making friendships and finding love are some common themes here. However, the entertainment level is on full gear as we get some very brutal fights and lots of blood. The film is extremely violent, which may be a turn-off for some people expecting a film like 2004's Miracle.Michael Dowse's film is about a man named Doug Glatt who heralds from an educated family and works as a bouncer at a bar, even though he seems dim-witted to a degree. But at a hockey game, he protects his best friend from a vicious hockey player by knocking him out cold which opens the eyes of the scouts. Despite disapproval from his parents, Doug gets a chance to shine as a enforcer for a minor league hockey team....and one of his rivals is a washed-up enforcer named Ross Rhea.The acting is actually pretty good. Seann William Scott is known for his role as Stifler in the American Pie series, but he does an excellent job playing the complete opposite as the nice, but really dumb Doug. Jay Baruchel is okay as Doug's friend, but maybe tone down his language a bit. Liev Schreiber does a fine job as Rhea. Eugene Levy makes a cameo as Doug's father.Overall, Goon turned out to be a pleasant surprise. It's much more than a sports film as it centers on a rags-to-rich story, which makes it all the better because of Doug's personality. There is enough blood and brawls to satisfy hockey fans or any sports fan in general. I'm not a hockey guy, but I was able to enjoy the film very much so because I pretty much saw the brawls as boxing on ice. It's a good, entertaining film. I rate this film 9/10.",9,0,0,28 November 2014
Now You See Me," I Hope You're Able To Suspend Your Disbelief!
","Now You See Me may lack great characterization or a tight script, But I'll be darned if I didn't say I was dazzled and razzled by the film. It shouldn't have been entertaining as it was, but I was able to suspend my disbelief for two hours and I was able to be transported into some sort of fun alternate reality. But the CGI is great and it was used at the right times instead of just constantly.Louis Leterrier's film is about a group of magicians named The Four Horseman who are magicians on the outside, but on the inside they are actually bank robbers. When FBI and Interpol catch their scent, this ensues a thrilling chase where the Horseman must stay one step ahead of the FBI.This film boasted a nice set of attractive actors and actresses. Jesse Eisenberg and Woody Harrelson were excellent, proving their A-list status. Isla Fisher and Dave Franco were great supplements to the previous two. Franco actually had a great scene involving a tense car chase. Mark Ruffalo was really good as the lead FBI agent. Finally, who can forget about the great Morgan Freeman and the great Michael Caine?Overall, Now You See Me is a really fun movie and I was certainly dazzled. The CGI and the set pieces were great. I can also say the same for the acting and the directing, which makes up for the lack of a good screenplay and characterization. It is action-packed and it is funnier than I thought it would be. Out of the two films based on magicians that came out in 2013, this film is the better one. Sorry Jim Carrey! I rate this film 9/10.",9,5,9,17 September 2014
X-Men: Days of Future Past," Best X-Men Yet!
","X-Men: Days of Future Past is the X-Men movie that we have all been waiting for. The last movie that could give this film a run for its money was 2003's X2. 2011's First Class was a step in the right direction, but this film is very masterful and engaging. I loved the idea of combining old cast with new cast and the results are impressive. The story is written well and there are several emotional moments. The action is also very good and some of the set pieces are just grand. The visuals compliment the action and they come out in full-force during the scenes of Quicksilver. Bryan Singer returns to the helm to direct this film. The main theme is changing history so that the future will be different from which the past set it out to be. Wolverine is sent back to the 1970's to stop a program in which mutants are being targeted by these sentinels which are created to take out and destroy mutants. This movie has one of the greatest ensembles in recent film history. The old cast is here, the new cast is here, and they combine forces to put on a show. Hugh Jackman is ever awesome as Wolverine. Patrick Stewart/James McAvoy and Ian McKellan/Michael Fassbender are all great in their respective roles as Professor X and Magneto. Jennifer Lawrence has some great scenes as Mystique. Peter Dinklage made a great addition to the cast as the main villain and someone to keep an eye on is Evan Peters as Quicksilver.Overall, X-Men: Days of Future Past is the X-Men sequel we have all been waiting for. By combining old and new, we have ourselves one of the greatest comic books film ever made. Not only is there impressive action, the storyline comprises of raw human emotion and characterization. By far, this is the greatest X-Men movie made to date and I am eager to see how this universe is expanded in the future. My Grade: A+",10,3,4,11 April 2015
Gandhi," Intense Film About a Peaceful Man!
","Gandhi is a sprawling, epic biography about one of the greatest, most influential leaders to have ever walked on our planet. That man was Mahatma Gandhi. He brought about the independence of India from the British Empire without enforcing the need for violence. He also wanted peace between all the Muslims and Hindus in India. This movie perfectly describes how Gandhi set to achieve his goals despite the British Empire trying to stop him.Richard Attenborough's film is about the life of Gandhi from his early adult life all the way to his brutal end. The way this man preached for peace and independence should influence all men and stop the unnecessary violence in this world.This film is very well-acted. I never thought a non-Indian like Ben Kingsley could pull off this kind of role off. But he did. Kingsley truly gave a magnificent performance and I felt like I was watching Gandhi himself. All the supporting actors were very good even though there are too many to list. A trivial fact for movie fans: Daniel-Day Lewis is indeed in this movie.Overall, this is one epic film about a man who united his country. This film has the essential cinematic qualities and it remains one of the top biographies ever made. The only thing that goes against this movie is the running length of over three hours long. But it was well-paced and has very powerful dialog. This film is a must-see for everyone. I rate this film 9/10.",9,2,3,19 June 2013
American History X," Possibly the Best Movie Ever!
","American History X is possibly one of the best movies I have ever seen. I never seen a movie such as this. I heard all the good things about this film so it amazes me how I never got around to watching it. It was one of those films that made me wish it would never end even though is was about two hours long.This is about how a racist guy was sent to prison for a hate murder. When he is released three years later, he must stop his younger brother from following in his footsteps.The acting is amazing. It's beyond me how Edward Norton did not win the Academy Award. Edward Furlong is great as the younger brother. In fact, the whole cast is excellent.The only thing that may turn people away from this movie is the use of excessive racist terms. I thought it worked out for this kind of movie. I did not mind the language.Overall, this is a very good, well-acted drama. There's even a few surprises mixed in. I rate this film a 10/10.",10,0,1,2 September 2011
Ocean's Eleven," Great Heist Movie!
","Ocean's Eleven is not a bad movie. I thought it was the OK the first time I watched it. I had to see it a second time to like it even more. I appreciate the actors in this film even more now. If you want a crowd-pleaser, popcorn film, this is the movie.Danny Ocean recruits eleven members to rob three casinos of Terry Benedicts in Las Vegas. They are going to steal $160 million dollars. The other members of the heist may be unaware but Danny Ocean has a big reason for pulling this heist off.The acting is great. If you want to see a film with brand-name actors, this is the film. George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, Julia Roberts, Andy Garcia, Bernie Mac, Don Cheadle, and Carl Reiner all did a fantastic job.This film starts of somewhat slow and boring but the excitement appears within the middle of the film. Steven Soderbergh did a great job.Overall, this is a great heist movie. I rate this film 8/10.",8,0,2,23 February 2009
Pearl Harbor," A Great View of WW2!
","I don't understand why so many people hate this movie. This is a very good movie. My only negative opinion here is that there is too much romance. But, there is plenty of action and drama to keep me entertained. I read some commentaries by Bay and Affleck about the criticism. They say that's what life was back then and my grandparents agreed. Haters really need to keep their mouths shut if they never lived in the 40's.This movie is about the attacks on Pearl Harbor which made the U.S enter the war. The story is told between two friends who witnessed everything in Hawaii.The acting is wonderful. The cast is an all-star cast. This is definitely Ben Affleck's best movie.Pearl Harbor is an emotional, tear-jerking movie. Hans Zimmer's score is good at helping that. There are many memorable quotes that will stick around forever. All in all, I loved this film. I rate this film 9/10.",9,1,3,9 July 2010
Tropic Thunder," Pretty Funny!
","Tropic Thunder is actually pretty funny. Despite the strong cast, I did not want to see this film because it didn't appeal to me. Well I just saw it and it was funnier than expected. I had many laugh out moments especially when Tom Cruise was on screen.This is about five actors who are in Vietnam filming a war movie when things get real and dangerous like it was back in the Vietnam War.The acting is great. Stiller, Black, and Downey had great chemistry. I loved how Downey portrayed the black guy as a white guy. I loved the way the foul-mouthed Cruise danced. That was hilarious.Overall, this is a better comedy that I thought. It did have some slow moments. But this is mostly for a crowd-pleaser. I rate this film 8/10.",8,0,1,15 February 2011
Scott Pilgrim vs. the World," Surprised!
","I was surprised how awesome this movie is. I read many great reviews about it but I thought it would just be for fanboys. Well, the great reviews sucked me into this film. The moment the Universal graphic was changed into video game style, I knew I would be in for a treat.The plot is very simple. It's about one guy who has to defeat his new girlfriends seven exes in order to successfully date her.The acting is not bad actually. I don't know much about Michael Cera only previously seeing him in Juno, but he was pretty good. His roommate portrayed by Kieran Culkin gave me many laughs. Mary Elizabeth Winstead looks cute here.This is the perfect movie for everyone to see. This is mostly a drama movie with hardcore action mixed in. I hope this movie gets nominated for an Oscar or two which I doubt. It should have done better at the box office too. Anyway, I really enjoyed this film. I rate this film 9/10.",9,3,9,23 December 2010
The Usual Suspects," Interesting Movie!
","The Usual Suspects is a very interesting movie that kept my attention span for the entire film. I was also drawn to this movie by the high IMDb rating. Does this movie live up to that 8.7? I really do not think so, but it comes close.This story is about a guy named Verbal Kint who is interrogated by a federal agent and he tells the story about how some mob boss commissioned him and four others to do a job and also about the massacre upon a boat.This movie has relatively unknown actors. Kevin Spacey was the guy I recognized the most and he did a really fantastic job. The rest of the cast gave convincing performances including Gabriel Byrne and the late Pete Postlethwaite.This movie is known for the twist ending. I did not expect that to happen at all. The movie really did a good job keeping you in suspense.Now this movie is somewhat overrated. I was lost a few times in the story and I thought the screenplay could have been better. Those are the only flaws I can point out.Overall, this is a very good crime film and it was made with a very low budget. I rate this film 8/10.",8,0,0,3 May 2012
Die Hard 2," Not As Good As The Original!
","Die Hard 2 is a very good film, just a tad underneath Die Hard. There is just as much action as there was in the first film but the acting is a little more stupid than before.Bruce Willis returns as John McClane. He undercovers a plot to bring a drug lord freedom by taking over Dulles Airport and holding airplanes up in air until Esperanza is free. McClane must battle with incompetent airport security, a terror squad, and that this wife is on one of the planes that are losing gas.As I said before, the acting is a bit more shabby. I liked the terrorists in the original Die Hard movies better. Bruce Willis shows that he can kick butt.One thing that opened my eyes is that this can happen in real life. Terrorists are capable of doing crap like this and that kind of worries me. Still a great movie! Overall, the action is great, the special effects are above average, and Bruce Willis is the best action hero there is(at least one of them). I rate this film 9/10.",9,1,3,2 January 2009
Quantum of Solace," Worthy Sequel!
","This is only the second James Bond movie I have seen and I enjoyed it much as the first one, Casino Royale. I was happy that this one was shorter, more straight-to-the-point. The action scenes were done well even though they could have been edited much better. The opening song from Keys/White is better than Chris Cornell's in Royale.Bond this time faces Dominic Greene who claims he an environmental activist. Actually, he just some bad guy that Bond wants to kill. That's all I know about the plot.The acting is pretty good. Most people say that Craig is not as good as Brosnan, but I cannot comment on that yet. I'm glad they gave Judi Dench more screen time. I hardly saw her in Casino Royale. Also, the Bond Girl is good-looking.Basically, I saw this movie for the action. I don't care much what the plot's about. I was rewarded with great action scenes. I loved the beginning car chase. Overall, I thought this was a great movie. Maybe my views will change after I see the earlier Bonds. I rate this film 9/10.",9,0,8,15 September 2010
Independence Day," A Great Blockbuster!
","What's the fuss about this movie? Why does everyone think so poorly of this? Well, in my opinion they compare this film to the Best Picture movies. This is not a Best Picture film, but a very entertaining popcorn film. This tells the tale of aliens attacking Earth and a group of survivors must unite together to destroy the invading aliens. The acting is decent. Will Smith, with a movie career underway, is excellent. Bill Pullman is great as the President. The effects were amazing especially when the buildings were blown up. David Arnold's music score is just fantastic. The theme is still stuck in my head. Overall, this is an excellent film. I rate this film a 10/10.",10,156,233,7 August 2008
Legends of the Fall," Sweeping Epic!
","Legends of the Fall is a sweeping romantic western that is one to remember for the ages. I love when they make these kind of films because they bring out the inner western solitude from me. This film reminded me deeply of Dance With Wolves which of course is better, but this is still a strong-willed film. This film is not only a showcase of great acting, but it features sweeping, gorgeous cinematography and just stunning landscape shots which are always necessary in movies like this.Edward Zwick's film is about the bond of three brothers and their powerful father who is a retired colonel. This film follows the storyline of the kids growing up to the time of World War One and Prohibition.As I said before, this film is a showcase for acting. It features top-notch performances from everyone in the film but Brad Pitt and Anthony Hopkins carry the film. Hopkins has one of his better roles as the retired colonel and he is just so good. Brad Pitt proves here why he has the makings of being a star. He had a few emotional scenes where he struggled to find his inner self.Overall, this is a glorious, sweeping epic that does not take itself too seriously. It has a few central themes about family and friendship and this movie does a good job on getting those points across. This film may not have much action, but the western aspect is done well as that is why I'm reminded of Dance with Wolves. I rate this film 9/10.",9,0,2,4 March 2013
No Country for Old Men," Does This Deserve an Oscar?
","No Country for Old Men is a very good movie, better than I expected it to be. I was disappointed because I expected more action instead of drama. But, I still believe that this movie is a masterpiece.This film is about a guy named Llewyln. He accidentally stumbles upon two million dollars. He decides to take it with him and that is unfortunate. Now he has a bloodthirsty villain with killing as his favorite sport after him. Also, the sheriff's department has to get to the bottom of the mystery.The acting is great. Tommy Lee Jones is still a great actor in these kind of movies. Josh Brolin is wonderful as Llewyln. Javier Bardem is the best, though. He delivers a brilliant performance of the most ruthless villain I have ever seen.This movie is full of suspense and mystery. The Coen brothers captivated most movie audiences with this thrilling drama. In fact, this movie won an Oscar. Does this movie really deserve an Oscar? It's up to you, the reader to decide. I rate this film 9/10.",9,2,3,21 February 2009
District 9," Best Sci-Fi Film In Years...Until Avatar!
","2009 has been a year in breakthrough science fiction movies. Star Treak, Avatar, and now this ranks upon the best movies I have ever seen that came out this year. I did not see this over the summer because it looked kind of lame. I decided to get the DVD and I am glad I did. I really loved this movie. My eyes were glued to the screen from beginning to end.This movie was made as a mini documentary as if this movie was real. This movie is about a group of aliens living in the South African slums and they just want to go home. Unfortunately for them, the human government wants them here.This movie did well when it came out. That was surprising because this is a film made by an unknown director with unknown actors I have never heard of. The only familiar name to me is Peter Jackson, the director of Lord of the Rings. Overall, this is a fantastic sci-film with plenty of action. I rate this film 10/10.",10,0,4,26 February 2010
Mamma Mia!," At Least the Singing Is Great!
","I am not the biggest ABBA fan in the world, although I do like the songs 'Dancing Queen' and 'Mamma Mia.' This is the film adaptation of the hit Broadway musical, and I think it is a product of mixed results. The story is paper thin and poorly executed, and that is evident during the non-singing scenes. However on the flip side, there is no denying how campy and fun the film can be. The singing is actually not bad, and there are powerful renditions of the hit ABBA songs to be had, especially 'Dancing Queen.' Phyllis Lloyd's film is about a girl named Sophie who lives on a Greek island and is about to be married. However before the ceremony, she offers invites to three possible fathers that she may have never met, much to the chagrin of her mother, Donna. Now it's up to Sophie to find out who is her real father and try to improve relations between her mother and these men.This film does have an incredibly stocked cast. Meryl Streep is the goddess of all actresses, and she can do anything. She even has a good singing voice. She also looks very good for her age as of 2008. Amanda Seyfreid also does a good job and just like in Les Miserables, she delivers a strong singing performance. Whoever thought Pierce Brosnan would star in a film like this and do well. I think he was able to hold his own. We also have good performances by Colin Firth and Stellan Skarsgaard. Finally, I did not like Julie Walter's performance. She was just so annoying.Overall, Mamma Mia! could have and should have been a much worse adaptation that we got. I was pleasantly surprised, but the film is still a little mediocre. The story itself has big issues, but the songs and the characters are above average and everyone seems like they are having a good time. To be honest, this movie could have been much worse if we did not have Meryl Streep. Not a great film, nor a bad film. But it's entertaining enough. I rate this film 7/10.",7,0,1,12 December 2014
The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug," Bigger, Louder, and Bolder!
","The Hobbit: Desolation of Smaug is the middle movie of the fantasy prequel trilogy directed by Peter Jackson. The movie still has an enormous runtime, but the film moves at a steady pace backed by fantastic action sequences, excellent CGI (I'm looking at you, Smaug), great acting, and even a forbidden romance. We get some old, but welcome faces returning, most notably Legolas. The movie continues the same tone as An Unexpected Journey, but it is a little darker and at times, I felt like I was watching the Lord of the Rings tone-wise. Also, Smaug was impressive. His very words reeked of evil and Jackson did a great job bringing this literary beast to life.Peter Jackson's film continues the journey of Bilbo Baggins and the dwarfs as they continue their trek to the Lonely Mountain. They must fight through hungry spiders, blood-thirsty orcs, stubborn wood elves, a shapeshifter named Beorn, corrupt men of Laketown, and of course the dragon Smaug himself.The acting is very good, I think. Martin Freeman makes a fantastic Bilbo and he is good at making some great quips. Ian McKellan is fantastic as always as Gandalf. Richard Armitage continues his kingly manners as Thorin Oakenshield. Orlando Bloom makes a wonderful return as everyone favorite elf, Legolas. We have some good newcomers here: Evangeline Lilly as Tauriel, the she-elf who falls for the dwarf Kili, Lee Pace as the cold-hearted leader of the wood elves, and Luke Evans as Bard, a man who helps the dwarfs and yearns to kill Smaug.Overall, the Desolation of Smaug is an excellent movie. The Hobbit movies deserve a lot more credit than people give them for. They are different in tone and story from the Lord of the Rings, but they are still entertaining in their own way. This movie is led by many action sequences. I particularly enjoyed the barrel sequence as the dwarfs escape from the wood elves while be attacked by the orcs. That was an entertaining sequence highlighted by the fiery moves from the elves. The movie ends on a high note and I'm eager for what comes next. I rate this film 10/10.",10,4,7,14 January 2015
The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford," A Tale Between Jesse James and Robert Ford!
","2007 has been a very good year for very good Western films. There was No Country for Old Men, There Will Be Blood, and now this film. The Assassination of Jesse James By the Coward Robert Ford is a great film that tells a story of friendship and rivalry between Robert Ford and Jesse James. Robert glorifies Jesse and finds him as his idol even though James is clearly not portrayed as an idol.The acting is very good. Brad Pitt and Casey Affleck steals the show with their mesmerizing performance. However, it is not often I'll say that another actor is better than Brad Pitt. But in this film, Casey Affleck is better than Brad Pitt and deserves that Academy Award nomination.Overall, this is a fun movie to watch. Everything from the score to the acting to the art direction is just worth it. I rate this film 9/10.",9,1,1,16 June 2012
Remember the Titans," Great But Somewhat Predictable!
","This movie is a great sports movie and is full of amazing acting performances. Denzel Washington is a beast of an actor in every single movie he's in. The supporting cast like Will Patton and Ethan Suplee were very memorable. It's kind of predictable because I knew what would happen in the end even though some of it I did not expect.This is about a high school that becomes integrated in the early 70's. The head football coach of the black school became the head coach of the integrated school demoting the white coach to assistant coach.In some ways, this movie is very motivational and powerful. I actually know some great high school football players who use this movie to inspire them. I think Denzel Washington can inspire anyone.Overall, this is a great even though a little predictable movie. I rate this film 9/10.",9,0,1,30 September 2010
Batman Begins," Best Batman Yet!
","Batman Begins is one of the best films of 2005, if not the best. I had my doubts before seeing this. Shumacher was basically a flop, but after a couple minutes viewing this film, my thoughts instantly changed. The movie starts when Bruce Wayne was a little child, and leads to when he mastered his fears and became Batman. Christopher Nolan did a very good job directing this film. He had a Burton-like sense of how things should make you feel. This film was dreary-feeling, but in a good way. The acting was outstanding. Christian Bale was a good fit for Batman. The rest of the cast includes greats like Morgan Freeman, Michael Caine, Katie Holmes, and Liam Neeson. The score was memorable. The script could've been no better. Also, the visual effects was outstanding. It seems like that these things were real. I definitely recommend this movie. I give this film a 10/10.",10,3,4,8 December 2007
The Fault in Our Stars," Well-Meaning Tears!
","To anybody to sees The Fault in Our Stars, male or female, be sure to have a tissue handy. I have seen a countless number of films, and I confess this is the film that may have teared me up the most. This realistic story about two teens with cancer coming together is so sweet, but there is also an emotional weight added to the story because of the subject matter. The film doesn't try to be saccharine, but it tries to be sincere. The movie has a light-hearted tone for the most part, despite the dark subject matter and that I can truly be happy with. Josh Boone's film is about two kids named Hazel Grace and Augustus Waters who fall in love with each other when they meet at a cancer support group. Together they go on adventures with nothing to stop them, not even the Grim Reaper. The film is truly well-acted. Shailene Woodley deserves an Oscar nomination for this role. Her charisma is inspiring and this may be her best performance to date. Ansel Elgort is not too shabby himself. I loved his quirky personality and despite his problems, still has the ability to keep his witty charm. Nat Wolff was very good as Augustus's friend, who had cancer rob him of his eyesight. Laura Dern turned a sympathetic performance as Hazel's mother and Willem Dafoe gave an hateful, but very good performance as the author who influences Hazel. Overall, The Fault in Our Stars is an incredible film. It's a very deep, thought-provoking movie It goes in a lot deeper than a normal romance film would do, and that adds more effect to the film. By the time the end credits rolled, my eyes were dripping with tears and to say that's rare while watching a film is an understatement. A powerful, well- meaning story about cancer-stricken teens falling into such a passionate love. My Grade: A+",10,8,13,1 May 2015
Twilight," Surprised!
","I want to mention first off that I'm a guy and I'm not gay. But I really was surprised because this movie is actually good. I'm not into romance movies but there was enough dark tones to keep me hooked in. There was some cheesy dialog but I guess that can be forgiven.This is about a new girl named Bella who moved to Forks, Washington to be with her father. There she meets the love of her dreams, Edward. Little does she know that Edward is not human at all...The acting is not spectacular but isn't terrible. Kristen Stewart is not bad as people say she is. I wish Robert Pattison could have been better. But Billy Burke was the one that shined.The music is pretty good. I heard a great Linkin Park song during the end credits. The themes are gentle and appropriate.Overall, this movies stays true to the book. I guess I like Twilight better than I thought. I rate this film 8/10.",8,1,3,17 February 2011
Liar Liar," Amusing!
","Liar Liar is a funny film. But it has one annoying cliché and that would be Jim Carrey. This film is about a lawyer(Fletcher) who never tells the truth. On his son's 5th birthday, Max(the son) makes a wish that his dad will not lie for one day. That wish comes true at 8:15 the same day. Now, with the Fletcher telling the truth, there is going to be turmoil in the life of Fletcher. The acting is good for the most part. I thought that Jim Carrey was annoying doing his comedy antics. Some of his scenes were hilarious though especially when he his beating himself up. The other actors such as Maura Tierney and Jennifer Tilly did a good job. I liked the music in this film. There is nothing memorable, but who cares. Overall, this is a mildly amusing movie. But, Bruce Almighty should be seen first to see vintage Jim Carrey. I rate this movie 8/10.",8,1,1,6 November 2008
Wreck-It Ralph," Probably the Best Animated Film of 2012!
","Wreck-It Ralph is Disney Animation at it's best and it even has the feeling of a Pixar movie. Loaded with amazing visuals, a strong voice cast, some sly humor, and some nostalgic video-game references, this film is a must-see for all ages. As a huge fan of arcades growing up, I was able to understand most of these references and it brought out the inner child in me. The film is bright and colorful and it seems to give off happiness, especially in Candy Land.Rich Moore's film is about a villain named Wreck-It Ralph who yearns to be the good guy after thirty years of being the bad guy. But he travels from game to game trying to become a hero, but because of some unfortunate circumstances, Ralph must save the arcade from a dire threat.This film has a solid voice-cast full of some good comedians. Who wouldn't recognize the voice of John C. Reilly? He certainly brings Ralph to life. Sarah Silverman is really good and I was surprised to find out she voiced the little girl. Finally, Alan Tudyk impressed me as King Candy main because he sounded exactly like Ed Wynn, who voiced Mad Hatter in Alice in Wonderland.Overall, Wreck-It Ralph is a triumphant return to form for Disney. This film is even better than recent Pixar pictures and that is saying something. It's a charming, light-hearted film that's fun for the entire family. Video-game fans will truly appreciate this film and all the subtle video-game references. I sure did. A great film with some inspiring messages. I rate this film 9/10.",9,2,3,8 April 2014
Bridesmaids," Good Film though Not That Funny!
","I never thought I would actually like Paul Feig's Bridesmaids. Everyone was calling this the Hangover for women. I thought it would not fit my taste, but I gave this film a shot anyway. It is actually a pretty good film but not as funny as I hoped. I'm rating this film high because despite the marketing of this film as a comedy, I was touched by all those dramatic scenes.This film is about the ups and downs of a friendship between two best friends as one of these friends is about to get married and the other friend is Maid of Honor.I must say Melissa McCarthy stole the show. I never really heard if her until this movie came out. I know some people despise her because of her gross-out humor, but I thought she made the comedy in this film. Kristin Wiig also gave herself a good name as she played her character very well. She had a very sad character which surprised me as I thought she would have me cracking up.Overall, this is a funny and touching film. This film surpassed my expectations by a lot. I was kind of disappointed that this two-hour long film didn't get much laughs as advertised, but I loved the drama so that's good. I rate this film 8/10.",8,0,2,7 February 2013
Meet the Fockers," Funnier Sequel!
","Meet the Fockers is better, badder, and funnier than Meet the Parents. I was laughing nonstop throughout this movie. In this film, Pam and Gaylord are set to be married. But, Pam's parents must meet Gaylord's parents who are complete opposite of the Byrnes. There are many hilarious moments including little Jack saying his first word, Jack's new baby device, Gaylord's sex-loving parents, Owen Wilson's character, and much more. This has to to be the funniest movie since the original American Pie series. I liked this so much better than Meet the Parents. Even though this is a comedy, the cast was great. Dustin Hoffman, Robert De Niro, and Ben Stiller are the best. Randy Newman added great songs to make this movie more merrier. This is a funny movie, but I would not take your parents to see this. I rate this movie 10/10.",10,1,2,26 November 2008
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," A Welcome Return to Middle Earth!
","The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey brings back a flood of old memories as we are welcomed back to Middle Earth, nine years after the Return of the King. The Hobbit is just as awesome as any of those films, even though it's more of a different film. This is more light-hearted and colorful than the LOTR trilogy. However, the film is still very lengthy but there are some good action scenes, many funny moments, excellent CGI, and great acting. This film reminds me of the Fellowship of the Ring, but in a good way of course.Peter Jackson returns to direct the first of this new trilogy and it's set sixty years before the events of the LOTR. Bilbo Baggins has been recruited by Gandalf and thirteen dwarfs led by Thorin Oakenshield to reclaim their mountain that was taken away by Smaug, a fierce dragon.The acting is very good. We see some familiar faces here in the likes of Ian McKellan, Elijah Wood, Ian Holm, Andy Serkis, Hugo Weaving, Cate Blanchett, and Christopher Lee. Some of these actors shouldn't have been in this film, but nonetheless their parts are still good. McKellan still makes a great Gandalf. Andy Serkis makes a welcome return as Gollum and the riddle scene between Bilbo and Gollum is perhaps the greatest moment of this film. As for the newcomers, Martin Freeman makes a great Bilbo and is better than what I have thought. Richard Armitrage is great as Thorin, the leader of the dwarfs.Overall, The Hobbit is an excuse just to reach into Middle Earth again, but a great excuse. I wasn't expecting a return here, but I'm most definitely glad there was. I'm fine with all the additions to the story because if anything, it enhances it. It's nice to see background of what happened to our heroes. A fantastic beginning of this new trilogy. I rate this film 10/10.",10,2,5,4 May 2014
Before Sunset," Now Here's An Unexpected Movie Sequel!
","Before Sunset picks up right where the first film, 1995's Before Sunrise left off. For those who have seen that film, one would not expect a sequel especially a decade later. But this sequel captures the magic the first film left us as well as the charm, romance, and the ideological dialog. All this film is two people walking the streets of Paris and talking to each other, but we feel connected to these characters for the eighty minutes this film is on screen. The screenplay is very sharp and not once can we tell if the dialog is forced. This film is an example of how an excellent conversation should be, especially between people who haven't seen each other in ages.Richard Linklater's sequel reintroduces us to the characters of Jesse and Celine. Jesse is now a bestseller author who has written a book based on the one night the two of them had nine years earlier. While promoting his book in a bookshop, Jesse runs into Celine. With Jesse returning to the states that evening, the two spend the afternoon together catching up and reminiscing on what could have been.Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy continue to show such natural chemistry between each other. If I didn't know any better, they could have been two ordinary people having such an engrossing conversation on love, politics, and more ideology of that nature. This film doesn't need a large cast and I feel that both Hawke and Delpy were perfect in their roles.Overall, Before Sunset is an excellent sequel to one of the best original romantic films I have ever seen. Both of these films succeed without being sappy or forced. I liked the natural feel of this film and it's a shame Hollywood doesn't produce more films like these. They are the perfect compliment to the special-effects era of movies. This is a sweet, romantic modern-era romance film and a fitting sequel to Before Sunrise. I rate this film 9/10.",9,1,1,20 October 2014
Non-Stop," The Stakes Never Been Higher!
","Non-Stop is a better-than-average action movie that takes place solely in the air. With the only location being an airplane, this action film manages to be quite thrilling and entertaining. I thought this would be a retread of Taken, but in the air but instead it's a complex thriller that has quite a few twists. It's the kind of movie where you'll never quite know who the villain is until they reveal themselves. That is what I liked about this movie.Jaume Collet-Serra's film is about an alcoholic air marshal who has a haunted past. Aboard a transatlantic flight, he receives text messages saying that people will die unless he transfers 150 million dollars into an offshore account. Now in a race against time and unknown villains, Bill Marks must be sure to hit the right mark.Liam Neeson does very well in this role as the grizzly drunk air marshal. When needed, he still features a simple set of action moves that made him a bona-fide action star. Julianne Moore was good, though I feel like her role should have been more challenging. We also get good supporting turns from Scoot McNairy and Lupita N'yongo.Overall, Non-Stop is a surprisingly great action thriller that is tense and suspenseful. The twists and turns come out at you from each direction, so I must give the screenplay the credit it deserves for not making the film predictable. If you're expecting this film to be Taken in the air, then you're in for a surprise. There are a few action scenes, but not as much as there could have been so this film works more of a thriller thankfully.My Grade: A-",9,0,0,19 February 2015
The Princess Bride," Inconceivable!
","The Princess Bride has long been seen as a cinema classic and it has often been voted as one of the top films of the 80's, a sentiment that I would have a hard time disagreeing with. As a fan of the fantasy genre, this film falls in my wheelhouse. Despite me probably liking this film no matter what, there is no denying the talent behind the film. The story is simple, but sweet and written very well. The film is expertly directed and well-acted. The visuals even do a good job standing the test of time. In all, this was a very entertaining fantasy romp about the quest for true love. Rob Reiner's film is about a poor farm girl named Buttercup who is forced to marry the evil Prince Humperdinck, but her childhood love named Westley comes back as the Dreaded Pirate Roberts to rescue her from the clutches of the prince. The film may not have the most exotic cast in the world, but there is no denying how good they were and how much fun they seemed to have. I liked Cary Elwes as Westley as well as Robin Wright as Buttercup. Andre the Giant was actually very good as Fezzik, and likewise Christopher Guest as Count Rugen and Chris Sarandon as the Prince. Overall, The Princess Bride is the film for all ages. It is the kind of film that shall be passed down from generation to generation. As a fantasy lover, it has all the elements you can ask for as you expect from such a film. I loved the theme about true love as it's a theme that will always be relevant. It's such a gorgeous film and one that is also funny. My Grade: A",9,1,1,22 April 2015
Saving Private Ryan," A Very Fine War Movie!
","Saving Private Ryan is one of the best war movies ever made. There are some faults to it but most of the times the movie is just breathtaking especially the beginning scenes at Omaha Beach. Since this movie historical fiction, some of the aspects are not going to be real. People should stop complaining about that in not only this, but other historical movies.This movie is about how the 2nd Battalion led by Captain Miller tries to find the fourth brother to take him home because his three brothers died in war.The acting is very good here. Tom Hanks is a staple in every movie he's in. This is one of Matt Damon's early movies. This and Good Will Hunting were the ones that brought him to considerable fame.This was put forth a great effort by Steven Spielberg, my all-time favorite director. The war scenes were amazing. John Williams composed a great though small score.Overall, this is one of my favorite war movies. There is tons of violence and gore though. I rate this film 9/10.",9,1,2,25 October 2010
How to Train Your Dragon 2," A Great Sequel!
","How to Train Your Dragon 2 is a rather great sequel to the original Dreamworks surprise hit. Just like the first film, we get another rousing product from the studios, which further expands on the world of the Vikings and dragons, as well as the expanding friendship between Hiccup and Toothless. The movie takes place five years after the original, so we get to see our heroes go through adolescent issues as they age in this original, creative world. The story is resonant and the characterization takes one step beyond from the original film. I also loved the beautiful animation, as it adds such a graceful step to the picture. This film has Hiccup and Toothless returning after the events five years prior. Hiccup is getting trained on leadership, and his friends are expert dragon racers. All seems peaceful, except there is this sinister force which plans on enslaving all the dragons and this force threatens the homeland of Hiccup, so once again they must save the day. The original cast returns and just like they did in the first film, they all do an amazing job. Gerard Butler, Jay Baruchel, Jonah Hill, etc. There are a few key additions to the cast such as the ever-great Cate Blanchett as Hiccup's long-lost mother and Djimon Hounsou as one of the beings behind this sinister movement. Overall, How to Train Your Dragon 2 is a wonderful sequel to such a beloved animated film. The film is very pretty to look at and it features a high-octane story with plenty of scary moments, so little children should be warned. There is also an emotional side to the film, which I was happy to see. I had a great time with this film and its film like these that makes me believe in the movies. If anything, this should have won at the Oscars. But I haven't seen Big Hero 6....yet, so time will tell. My Grade: A",9,3,5,16 May 2015
The Pianist," Grave Depiction of Jews In WW2!
","The Pianist is really not a war movie per se, but it is a movie that shows the hardships and struggles of the Jewish people during the second world war. This is an emotional movie made by the right man himself, Holocaust survivor Roman Polanksi. Roman lived in a concentration camp and knew what a ghetto was like and he accurately depicted that in this film.This film is centered around Jewish musician Wladysaw Szpilman and his family. This movie goes from the time they are forced to move into the Warsaw ghetto to the time when help comes from the least expected.Adrien Brody is the only household name you'll find in this movie. He does an extremely good job as Szpilman. I pitied his character for the whole movie.Overall, this ranks up there with Schindler's List. It is not as good as that film but it comes pretty darn close. This movie is well-made and should be seen years to come. I rate this film 9/10.",9,1,2,25 May 2012
The Grand Budapest Hotel," Brings A Smile To My Face!
","Every time I hear a new Wes Anderson movie is coming out, I get giddy with glee. I love the works of this amazing auteur, especially his last feature, Moonrise Kingdom. This movie, The Grand Budapest Hotel, is an excellent, stylish film set in the world of Anderson. The film is bright, colorful, and features exquisite cinematography as well as a delightful score from Alexandre Desplat-which finally got him his first Oscar. This film is funny as well with a great screenplay, which worked thanks to the amazing cast. Anderson's latest film is about a hotel concierge named Gustave who befriends a lobby boy named Zero and together they go on adventures. Gustave must rely upon Zero to help solve a murder in which he has been framed all over the account of a family inheritance. When this film has a big cast, I mean this film has a big cast. However, many of them don't get long chunks on the screen. Ralph Fiennes does very well as Gustave and his performance was just a laugh riot. Tony Revolori as the lobby boy also received points in my book as Gustave's new friend. The rest of the cast is just too large to list, but I particularly liked Harvey Keitel as Gustave's fellow escape plotter and Jeff Goldblum as the family's attorney. Overall, The Grand Budapest Hotel will appeal to everyone who is a fan of Wes Anderson. His style of filmmaking is unique and I adore the way he creates inventive ways to create movies. Not only is the story and acting excellent, the movie features strong technical talent. Tilda Swinton and her makeup is just one example. The movie is fast-paced and often funny, so I am glad this film was recognized by the Academy!My Grade: A",9,2,4,24 February 2015
The Transporter," Contains Great Action!
","I did not really expect much out of this movie. All I expected was just the normal action movie. Well this surpassed my expectations. Jason Statham is one of my favorite action stars of all time. There were plenty of car chases and memorable dialog.This is about guy named Frank Martin whose living is to transport smuggled girls all across Europe.The acting is not too bad. The only actor I knew from other movies was Statham. I liked the French inspector. He made this movie even more enjoyable.Overall, this is a highly intense movie made even better by the awesome soundtrack. I rate this film 9/10.",9,0,0,12 February 2011
Seabiscuit," An Uplifting Story During A Time For Darkness!
","Seabiscuit is a wonderful uplifting story how one single horse, named Seabiscuit changed the lives of many Americans who were suffering through the darkest period of American history: The Great Depression. This film is formatted as a sports story and in a way it is, but it is a character story and a story that show how good can triumph despite bad times. As one may expect, this film is a little saccharine at times, but there is no denying how this film will successfully play with your emotions.Gary Ross's film, based on the bestseller by Laura Hillenbrand, tells the story on how the lives of a businessman, a trainer, and a jockey merge together to give Americans something to cheer about, and that is the talented horse named Seabiscuit who came out of nowhere to win the races that means so much to everyone.The acting is really good thanks to the main three actors. Tobey Maguire does a great job as the young, hot-headed jockey whose horse is the only family he has got. Chris Cooper was very good as the weary horse trainer named Tom. Jeff Bridges was also excellent as the businessman who has grown wiser and kinder over time. William H. Macy was also entertaining as the quirky color commentator.Overall, Seabiscuit is a moving story about the horse who defied all odds to become a standout in modern American history. It was dark times, and Seabiscuit only made thing brighter. The horse and his jockey, Red overcame obstacles to reach their high point and that is what makes this film so emotional. It's not a rags to rich kind of story, but it's similar to that. I rate this film 9/10.",9,0,1,23 August 2014
Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol," Crazy Action=Best Mission:Impossible Yet!
","The fourth entry in the popular Mission: Impossible series apparently not only defied my own expectations, but defied most of the general population's. I won't lie, but I thoroughly enjoyed the first three films. I had no idea that the Ghost Protocol would be this good. First off, the director, Brad Bird had no experience with live-action scenes so I wasn't expecting much. But he did a commendable job. Secondly, the stunts are amazing! Tom Cruise does all his stunts and I want to know how he achieved scaling the walls of the tallest building in the world. That is very incredible.After a prison breakout in Russia, Ethan Hunt, his computer whiz Benji, an attractive agent Jane, and chief analyst William Brandt all join together to stop Kurt Hendricks from creating a nuclear war between Russia and the United States.The acting is really good. We all know what to expect from Tom Cruise as Ethan Hunt and he is better than ever. Simon Pegg added some good comedy. Jeremy Renner is becoming a star and I wouldn't be surprised if he took over this franchise one day.Overall, this is the best Mission: Impossible yet. The action is fluid and crisp. But the real story is the physics-defying stunts and the transition Brad Bird made from animation to live-action. I would love if he came back if any additional films are being made. I rate this film 9/10.",9,1,3,6 June 2013
Revolutionary Road," American Beauty Part Two!
","Revolutionary Road is a very strong drama that focuses around the happiness, or I shall say unhappiness of a middle-class, married couple of seven years. While not reaching the heights of 1999's American Beauty, this film serves the same purpose. They both touch on the subject of the dour effects that some people have about their status and how they are not living life the way they want to. In other words, this film can serve as a prequel to the fore-mentioned film. But this is a well-acted, tense drama that stays true to the literary source novel.Sam Mendes, who previously directed American Beauty, directs a film about a couple named Frank and April Wheeler. They are seemingly happy as Frank commutes to New York City for work and April is the typical housewife. But Frank despises his job and April is not pleased about how her life turned out to be. One day, she suggests moving to Paris. While reluctant, Frank finally agrees. But complications ensue which causes problems after problems and can the Wheelers survive these problems? A film like this needs to rely on their actors and thankfully this film delivers. The film reunites Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet for the first time since their historic pairing in 1997's Titanic. They both are fantastic and their chemistry is as great as always. It's funny because in Titanic, you can see the romantic love. In this film, you can see the tough love. Michael Shannon delivers one of his best performances as the son of the realtors who suffers from mental issues. We also get good performances from Kathy Bates, Kathryn Hahn, and David Harbour.Overall, Revolutionary Road is an excellent film. It plays out to be a small-town drama, but it goes bigger than that. I liked how this film can be described as a poor-man's American Beauty. It essentially is, but they are both excellent, unique films. The cinematography and costume design is great and same can be said for Thomas Newman's quiet, but excellent score. This is a really good movie built around the talents of Leonardo and Kate. I rate this film 9/10.",9,0,0,19 November 2014
Lawrence of Arabia," Epic On A Grand Scale, But.......
","This is not the greatest movie ever made. Don't get me wrong, this is still the father of all epics and it won't get any grander than this, but I felt like something was missing. Maybe it's the length or excess of plot material, but Lawrence of Arabia misses being perfect, but not by too much. At nearly four hours in length, the film is beautifully shot and loved the perfect, CGI-less desert sun. It's well-acted with stand-out performances by everyone involved and David Lean expertly directs an epic a lesser man could not get right.Lean's film is a biographical look at the adventurous T.E Lawrence who is known for his famous exploits in the Arab world. During World War One, British officer Lawrence is sent to the Arab world to unite the warring tribes against the Turkish empire.This film features perhaps the greatest acting achievements in film history. Peter O'Toole is just magnificent as Lawrence and this is the role that sent him down the road of stardom. Omar Sharif, no stranger to David Lean, is nearly as good as Lawrence's Arab buddy. Alec Guinness also delivers a strong performance as Prince Feisal.Overall, this is certainly the father of all epics. It has everything you want to see, especially in these older movies. A sweeping cinematography, a beautiful score, masterful acting, superb directing and great editing. However, this is not the greatest film in the world. It's overlong and sometimes a bit stuffy. But it's close and that I can definitely see. A film that shall not be forgotten for the ages. I rate this film 8.5/10",9,1,3,17 March 2014
The Lost World: Jurassic Park," Good Sequel!
","The Lost World is a nice sequel to watch. In retrospect, it should be based on the book but it's not. Who cares? I sure don't. The story begins with a girl getting attacked by small dinosaurs. Because of the incident, John Hammond sends Ian Malcolm back to the islands to document the island and find his girlfriend. Even if the storyline wasn't developed well, everything makes up for it. The acting is great(Goldblum, Vaughn, Moore). There are new dinosaurs and more T-Rexs. The special effects are great, even by today's standards. John Williams returns with another momentous score. The music is more darker in the film. I think that this movie is even scarier than the first Jurassic Park. I have no idea why people are bashing this movie. I rate this movie 9/10.",9,6,11,24 October 2008
Rise of the Planet of the Apes," Wasn't Expecting This!
","I came into this movie with very low expectations and I was just blown away by the time I finished the movie. I didn't expect much because I don't think fondly of the original series except for the very first one and 2002's remake was okay, but nowhere near anything like this and I'm being kind. I also wondered how a rookie director could handle a movie like this, but Mr. Rupert Wyatt did a mighty fine job.This film is a prequel set in modern-day San Francisco and tells the tale on how the apes took over the world. It all started with a drug that makes chimps have higher intelligence. The main ape in this movie, Caesar happens to be a victim of this drug. When Ceasar is taken away from his home and to an ape facility where he is mistreated, that is where the fun begins....The acting is kind of weak only because Andy Serkis's performance overshadows them all. He really played the part just wonderful and I'm amazed how he wasn't nominated for an Oscar, even though he was motion-capture. That being said, I think James Franco and Frieda Pinto were good in their roles.Overall, this is a movie that highly exceeded my expectations. The visual effects are amazing especially with Caesar. I also loved the expression of the chimps' eyes. Certainly better than the remake ten years ago. Even though there are some great action scenes which the Golden Gate Bridge scene comes to mind, there is a heart here. That is what the previous Plane of the Ape films were lacking. I rate this film 10/10.",10,3,5,11 March 2013
Cars," Another Pixar Classic!
","Over the past decade or so, Pixar and Disney has combined for many hit movies with Pixar being at least seven. This movie is one of them. It has the same feel as a Pixar film even though talking animals are out of the picture. This movie is creative with the use of talking cars. It does not mean Hollywood is running out of ideas even though that might be the case.This film is about a rookie racecar named Lightning McQueen. He had a three-way tie with two other mighty racecars. As he was going to the tiebreaker race, he gets lost and ends up in the middle of nowhere. Now he has to follow the demands of a small town and get back to the race in time.Well, there is plenty of voice talent. I liked Owen Wilson, Larry the Cable Guy, and the late Paul Newman.The music is pretty good. I'm glad the song by James Taylor was nominated for an Oscar. That is a very good song.Overall, this is a wonderful Pixar classic with maybe a bump or two in the road. It's full of twists and surprises. I rate this film 9/10.",9,0,1,20 April 2009
The Little Mermaid," Classic Disney Film!
","The Little Mermaid is the very beginning of the Disney Renaissance that began in the late 80's. This film is a heartfelt film that is pure magic and one for the entire family to enjoy. It has some beautiful, magical songs such as the much-heralded 'Under the Sea.' The animation is light and actually pretty clear for an 80's animation film. This film is going to be impossible to resist and is one of the better Disney animated films ever made.Based of the fairytale by Hans Christensen Anderson, Ron Clements film is about how a mermaid named Ariel makes a pact with the evil sea witch, Ursula to become human and she has three days to kiss her true love or else she will turn back into a mermaid and endure being her servant for eternity.This film really has no famous voice-cast but I truly must single out Jodi Benson for her exceptional voice work. This is her first big voice role and she hits it spot on. She truly has a voice and proves it singing all these magical songs.Overall, this is a classic Disney film that harks back to the olden days of Disney. This begins the classics that were spawned out in the 1990's. A film of pure magic and a family delight. It's funny, romantic, and more emotional than one would expect. A very good film indeed. I rate this film 9/10.",9,1,1,21 March 2014
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," Beautiful Piece of Filmmaking!
","Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is a masterful directorial effort by Ang Lee that is a beautiful film and is bound to sweep you off your feet. I haven't seen many foreign films up to this point, but I think now I shall. This film weaves a story and it feels like you're part of the story. The language barrier did not hold me back, and I felt like I was in 19th-century China part of this story. This movie is beautifully shot and features some of the best cinematography I have seen in film.Ang Lee, who directed such American classics like Brokeback Mountain and Life of Pi, directs a Chinese narrative that takes place during the reign of the Qianlong Emperor. Li Mu Bai's master was murdered by the Jade Fox and as he is about to retire, he finds out he has another chance to avenge his master's death.This film features some great acting by very talented international actors. Chow Yun-Fat is very good in his role and he should be, since he's one of China's best actors. Michelle Yeoh delivers a convincing performance as Fat's lover. Finally, Zhang Ziyi is very good in her role and delivers quite an emotional punch.Overall, this is a very beautiful film both story-wise and to look at. The film will make you seem as if you're in the story. Sure, the story can get silly sometimes, but most martial arts films do. The choreography is excellent and sometimes is very Matrix-like. The score is wonderful and exquisite. This is an action film, but there is plenty of substance here and there is definitely a great story being told. You can tell this film is in the hands of a talented director. Very well done! I rate this film 9/10.",9,0,1,4 February 2014
JFK," Not a Boring Moment to Be Seen!
","JFK is a very well written film. Since it is well-written, this movie is not boring despite the majority of the three and a half hour film being nothing but people talking. This movie kept me glued to my seat because I was so interested in this subject and also I was impressed on how Oliver Stone made this movie.This film is about the aftermath of John F. Kennedy's assassination. It is about how one public prosecutor does all he can to bring the murderers to justice and to explain how the assassination was a conspiracy.The acting is extremely good. There are many great actors here including Kevin Costner, Gary Oldman, Edward Asner, Sissy Spacek, and so on. I cannot single anyone out because everyone was so good.When this movie came out in 1991, it received plenty of criticism. If there is anyone who could make a movie like this, it would be Oliver Stone.Overall, this is a very good drama. The acting, screenplay, score, and direction are the high points of this film. I rate this film 9/10.",9,2,9,9 May 2012
Django Unchained," Quentin Taratino At His Finest!
","After the critical and commercial success of Inglourious Basterds, I often found myself wondering whether director Quentin Taratino would top his 2009 effort. It seems like he did in the form of Django Unchained. If you're a big Taratino fan, this film will deliver. While it features lots of violence and blood, the film often stays light-hearted because it has lots of comedy here. Taratino still has his knack for dialogue and he the script he wrote is just amazing and the dialogue is just perfect.Taratino directed a film that features a time when slavery was still prominent in the American South. This film is about a bounty hunter named Dr. Schultz who frees Django and Django joins him in the bounty-hunting business. They come up with a plan to rescue Django's wife from a slave owner who goes by the name of Calvin Candie.If you want to see incredible acting, this is the movie to see. Leonardo DiCaprio surely had a gutsy role and he delivers tremendously and it's one of his finest career performances. His scene at the dinner table was just fabulous and so abrupt. Very good performance. He is rivaled by Christophz Waltz who once again delivers an excellent performance and eerily similar to his role in Basterds. Jamie Foxx delivers a strong performance and has some of the best one-liners in the film. Also, Samuel L. Jackson added some clever comedy here to lighten things up.Overall, I don't know whether to call this Taratino's best movie since he directed many high-quality films like Basterds, Pulp Fiction, and the Kill Bill films. But if this is the way to get people to like westerns again, so be it. It's not historically accurate of course, but this is not meant to be. This film has plenty of gore, guts, and violence and any Taratino fan will be happily satisfied. I rate this film 10/10.",10,2,6,20 May 2014
Drive," Gritty, Violent Art-house Thriller!
","Drive is an excellent film just how most critics made it out to be. It is a gritty and sometimes quite disturbing film. It's also a way different film than I expected it to be and it seems I was the only person who accepted that. This film was basically marketed as action film similar to the Fast and the Furious franchise but in reality, it wouldn't come close. This is a slow-paced drama with very violent scenes incorporated in.This crime film directed by Nicholas Winding Refn is about a guy named 'Driver' who is a Hollywood stunt driver by day and getaway driver by night. He falls in love with his neighbor and that romance spirals them both into the underworld where heists gone wrong can be quite deadly.The acting is really good as it should be with a cast like this. Ryan Gosling is becoming a great, versatile actor as it seems like he has been in every movie that came out in 2011. Carey Mulligan, Albert Brooks, Oscar Isaac, and Ron Perlman make a very convincing supporting cast. I really thought Mulligan shined the most though.Overall, this is a very good crime thriller that reminds me of the heyday of crime films back in the 70's. I noticed how sharp the camera movements are especially when showing scenes of the city at night which reminded me of 2004's Collateral. It seemed like people didn't like this film because it didn't have many action sequences. But, Drive is good, very good for what it is. I rate this film 9/10.",9,2,4,5 May 2013
Bolt," Truly A Disney Film!
","I can't remember any film produced by Disney that I ever disliked. Every movie they made, whether it's Pixar or not, is a great movie to watch. Bolt is no exception. In fact, this brings Disney to another level.This film is about the bonds of friendship between Bolt, a 'superdog' and Penny, a young actress. Bolt thinks he has super powers but he he obviously does not. He realizes that when he takes a cross-country trek with a mangy cat and a weird hamster to save his human companion.I guess you could say the voiceovers are great. John Travolta and Miley Cyrus certainly did a good job.I liked the music in this film. I shouldn't be surprised because Travolta did star in Grease thirty years ago. The duet with Cyrus is a great song.This movie deserved to win some bigtime awards. The only reason this did not happen because Wall-E overshadowed this film.This is one of the best Disney animated films this decade. Actually, most of them are great animations. Anyway, I rate this film 10/10.",10,44,59,30 March 2009
Frozen," Disney In Excellent Form!
","Frozen is one of the best films to come out of Disney Animation in recent years. Tangled and Wreck-It-Ralph were excellent, but Frozen tops them all. The story is simple, but it is an excellent one. The film is great for people of all ages. Children will get the delight of a talking snowman and adults will be enthralled by the mature themes the movie present. As for the music, it can't get any better than this. 'Let it Go' is the most catchy and wonderful song. It's one that will be stuck in my head.Chris Buck's and Jennifer Lee's film is about a princess named Anna who takes a trip with a mountain boy and his reindeer in order to find her sister, the Queen Elsa who has magical powers in the form of turning everything to ice. She must find Elsa before the kingdom falls to corruption.The film has a nice voice cast. Kristen Bell delivers a fun, youthful performance as Princess Anna. Is Idina Menzel ever talented! She was excellent as Queen Elsa and when she belted her rendition of Let it Go, my heart just stopped. We also have some good supporting turns in Josh Gad and Ciaran Hinds.Overall, Frozen is one of the best Disney Animation films of this century and certainly rivals the best of the very best. The songs are excellent and worth singing along to, the animation is crystal clear, and above all, there is a story that is worth telling. A story about true love and how even magical, icy powers won't keep true love away. This is a delight for both kids and adults alike. I fell in love with this film and I clamor for a sequel, a good one though. I rate this film 10/10.",10,7,13,10 January 2015
2012," Typical Disaster Film!
","This is like any normal disaster film that came out within the past ten years: a nice CGI spectacle that lacks script and story. But, 2012 has somewhat of a story. At least there are some emotional parts of the film. This movie is also somewhat scary. I am not a believer of destruction of the world in 2012 but I was thinking during the movie what if? This film is about the impending 2012 destruction of the world. The actors were very good. I liked the parts of John Cusack, Chiwetel Ejiofer, and Danny Glover. Glover is one of my favorite actors because of the Lethal Weapon movies.Overall, this is a very good movie that has big, explosive special effects and very good acting. It lacks somewhat of a script. Too bad the effects were not nominated for any Oscars, but Avatar did have great special effects. I rate this film 10/10.",10,3,11,13 March 2010
Ghost Rider," Fun to Watch!
","Ghost Rider is actually not that bad of a film. In fact, it is a very good film. I must be in the minority when it comes to liking this film. This is not going to win any major awards, but it's just a fun movie based off a comic book that one could easily enjoy on a rainy Friday night.This film is about a stunt bike rider named Johnny Blaze. The devil himself gives Blaze the power to hunt down demons who escaped from hell and send them back to the depths. His mission in this movie is to rid the world of Blackheart, who wants to control all souls.The acting is pretty good, if not a little over-the-top. Nicolas Cage really played Johnny Blaze well. Eva Mendes is a good actress as well as eye candy. But I truly enjoyed watching Sam Elliot as the cowboy and Wes Bentley as Blackheart.Overall, this is a pretty enjoyable film with great special effects. I thought the image of Ghost Rider looks awesome! i rate this film 9/10.",9,5,7,4 April 2012
X-Men: The Last Stand," A Grand Finale!
","X-Men:The Last Stand is an almost perfect movie to the end of the original X-Men trilogy. Compared to what other people said about this movie, I really liked it. X2 is certainly a better movie but this movie is better than the first X-Men. This movie actually had emotional qualities and that was unexpected.In The Last Stand, a cure for mutation has been found. Magneto wants to use the cure for his own cause for mutant domination and the government has a plan that all mutants be cured. It's up to the X-Men to save the world.The acting is pretty strong. Hugh Jackman delivers another great performance and Halle Berry as Storm has a bigger role this time around. Ian McKellan is still sinister as Magneto.Overall, this is a fun superhero movie that closes out a great trilogy. This movie has plenty of action, comedy, and heartfelt emotions. This movie is better that what I was led to believe. I rate this film 9/10.",9,4,6,5 March 2012
The Lives of Others," A Monumental Triumph!
","The acclaimed German-speaking film, The Lives of Others is a well-written, addicting thriller that talks about a time in very modern history that not many movies have covered. This film covers Eastern Berlin in the 1980's, just before the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989. Unlike many thrillers, this film doesn't rely on drawn-out car chases or bloody gun battles, but more so on tense character development and I welt so moved by the film, I literally thought there would be members of the Stasi creeping up behind me while watching the film.Florian Donnersmark's film, which was awarded an Oscar for best foreign film, is about a member of the secret police named Captain Wiesler who listens into people he believes to be enemies. But when he is assigned to listen to the famous and beloved playwright, Georg Dreyman, his life is about to take on a big change.This film is great in part to the wonderful acting. The late Ulrich Muhe does a wonderful job as Captain Wiesler and all his scenes were just perfection. In fact, the final scene he is in should be enough to move you to tears. Sebastian Koch does a great job as Georg Dreyman, a playwright who is also bent on escaping over the Wall.Overall, The Lives of Others is a very well-made thriller that will teach you about the lifestyle of people back then and how the citizens had to live in fear. There are no car chases here, but there is an actual story that is worth checking out. These kind of slow-burners are the best thrillers of them all and this made for an engaging thriller. Despite being spoken in German, I think Americans should watch this film. I rate this film 9/10.",9,4,6,12 September 2014
Hellboy," A Good Fantasy Film!
","Hellboy is a good fantasy film. I like this for various reasons. One of my reasons is that Guillermo Del Toro blends history/reality with fantasy really well. When the movie was focused on the Nazis, they had the correct facts plus magic elements added in the storyline. Basically, the story is about a character on Earth from another dimension facing two battles: evil creatures from his dimension and love. I liked the character's personalities. Hellboy is laidback and tell jokes while fighting and Liz is just calm and collected except when in immediate danger. The acting is fairly good. I enjoyed the characters. The visuals are exceptional as it is usually with Del Toro's film. The music is better, different than usual superhero movies. The only thing negative is that it may be confusing at some points. Overall, a great action/fantasy movie. I rate this movie 9/10.",9,1,2,16 October 2008
Good Will Hunting," Very Emotional Drama!
","Good Will Hunting is just a very great drama from the late 90's I believe if it was not for Titanic, this movie would have swept the Oscars. This movie did deserve to win the screenplay award. Matt Damon and Ben Affleck really wrote a fine script.This is about some hotshot kid who is always getting into trouble. It's up to some psychology professor to change the ways of the kid or else he will be spending time in jail.This is the first serious movie I have seen that featured Robin Williams. He did a very good job and I was impressed. Matt Damon is likable in any movie he's in. Ben Affleck did a decent job as well.There are some powerful scenes that may have people in tears. There is plenty of cursing but it works with the film.Overall, this is a great drama and I will watch it again. I rate this film 9/10.",9,0,1,7 November 2010
The Secret Life of Walter Mitty," A Feel-Good Experience!
","The Secret Life of Walter Mitty is one of the most thoughtful, pleasant movie experiences of 2013. This seemed to be a really decisive movie, But I'm firmly camped with those who loved it. It is a very unique film and tone is completely different from which we are accustomed with when it comes to Ben Stiller. Tropic Thunder is excellent, and this film is excellent for different reasons. This is an ambitious film which explores the meaning of life. The film features gorgeous cinematography and a rather progressive soundtrack that I personally liked.Ben Stiller's film is about a man named Walter who worked for sixteen years as a manager for negative assets for LIFE magazine. After his and many others jobs are threatened, Walter goes on a personal journey through means of his own fantasies and his own physical journey.The acting is excellent. Ben Stiller leaves his normal comedy style behind to create an endearing, heart-warming performance. I think the same can be said for Kristen Wiig, as Stiller's love interest. Adam Scott is great at playing the jerk boss, but his beard seems a little off. Sean Penn makes a delightful cameo, but I would have liked to see more of his acting here.Overall, the Secret Life of Walter Mitty is a very good movie and it seems to be more of a personal meditation made to guide you through life. I cannot see why some people despised this film, but I guess they must be a miserable as Walter Mitty himself. This is a beautiful-looking film that has such an enjoyable, abstract movie. I rate this episode 9.5/10.",9,1,1,23 January 2015
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Stunning Masterpiece!
","The second part in the Lord of the Rings installment is a great masterpiece. In fact, all three movies are masterpieces. I believe that this film is slightly better than the first one. In the Two Towers, Frodo and Sam are being led to Mordor by the beast, Gollum. Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli are hunting Merry and Pippin, are involved getting Theoden of Rohan away from Saruman's control, and fighting Saruman's Orcs. Gandalf is better than ever in this film. He is not dead as we all assumed. Gollum is great in this film. Andy Serkis should have been nominated for Best Supporting Actor. The CGI is amazing, so amazing it makes Gollum appear life-like. I liked Treebeard in this film. He serves as a mentor to Merry and Pippin. I liked the chemistry between Legolas and Gimli. They provide comedy in perilous times of Middle Earth. The acting is excellent especially Elijah Wood and Ian McKellen. Howard Shore continues with his captivating music. The effects, especially the visual effects are great. This is truly an epic. The whole theater was on it's feet doing a standing ovation when the end credits rolled along. If you haven't already, see the Return of the King. I rate this movie 10/10.",10,1,4,9 November 2008
Schindler's List," Powerful!
","Schindler's List is one of the best films if better made. I think it made my top ten list of all time movies. By the ending, I was all choked up. It's almost impossible for me to be choked up in a movie. What made this film even more powerful than the content is that it was filmed in black and white. It had a powerful effect on me and most other viewers.This movie is about the transformation of a war profiteer and how he goes from a self-centered businessman to a rescuer of Jews during the second world war.The acting is unbelievable. I thought Liam Neeson was okay in the first ten minutes then he really brought his acting skills to another level after that. Ralph Fiennes was great. It was very easy to hate his character.Steven Spielberg is a marvelous director. All of his movies I seen were great ones and this may be his best. John Williams provided a mesmerizing score that will haunt my mind for a long time.Overall, this is a emotional movie. This makes me hate Hitler and his SS pigs even more for what they did to these poor people. I rate this film 10/10.",10,9,13,10 November 2010
The Incredibles," A Great Pixar Animation!
","The Incredibles is actually a film better than I thought. I feared to see this film because it sounded boring. I was able to like this film. The story is about a former superhero who went into hiding with his family because of legal lawsuits. Fifteen years later, he wants to return to his old glory days. Now he has to fight one evil superhero to save the world. The acting/voicing in this film is great. Craig T.Nelson and Samuel Jackson were great. The story was written well. It keeps the audiences attracted to the film. The jazzy music is different, but good. This is a film for all ages. I rate this film a 9/10.",9,3,4,6 August 2008
Stardust," A Enjoyable Fantasy!
","This is a great film that concluded the 2007 blockbuster summer season. This is a great fantasy film that has some romance but thankfully is not overloaded with romance. I was surprised how much I liked this film because I thought this would be a full out romance movie with some aspects of fantasy mixed in. It's actually the other way around.This is about some guy who travels to a magic kingdom to retrieve a fallen star in order to be with some girl he loves. Unfortunately, the star is not what he expects and he isn't the only person looking for the star.The acting is very good. I liked newcomer Charlie Cox. Claires Danes did a magnificent job. My favorite screen presence is Robert De Niro. I really liked him here.Overall, this is a pleasant fantasy movie that is fairly family-friendly. I would want to see this again. I rate this film 9/10.",9,3,5,8 January 2011
The Elephant Man," Keep The Tissues Handy!
","The Elephant Man is truly a moving story that is earnest and throughout the film, it makes the point that humans are not animals, no matter the dysfunctions or handicaps. In the case of John Merrick, he is revolting to look at because of an terrible accident, but he makes clear to all the people wanting to use him or gape at him, he is a human just like the rest of them. No matter who you are, it will be impossible not to cry at some point. That's how emotionally-affecting this film is.Directed by David Lynch, this is one of his more conventional films, but the subject matter is still very intense. This film is about a surgeon at a London hospital named Frederick Treves who discovers a 'freak' named John Merrick and he rescues Merrick from a freakshow, thus allowing Merrick to live at the hospital and have a life of his own.The acting is excellent. John Hurt delivers a stirring performance as Merrick. I was not able to recognize underneath all that makeup, but he delivers a tour de force performance. Anthony Hopkins also does a really good job as the first man to have truly shown Merrick kindness.Overall, The Elephant Man is a film that believe that all people should be treated equally, no matter what he or she looks like. From a technical standpoint, this film is excellent. I liked how it was filmed in black and white because it captures the essence of the Victorian era. A really emotional film and while it's really sad, there are glimmers of hope here shown by Merrick. This is very fine filmmaking. I rate this film 9/10.",9,5,6,2 July 2014
I Am Legend," Great Film!
","I Am Legend is a great film. This is better than I thought it would've been. The beginning was kind of slow, but things sped up as the movie progressed. The story of this film is about a deadly, highly-infectious virus that wiped out most of New York City and perhaps the world. The only survivor in NYC, played brilliantly by Will Smith, is the virologist Robert Neville. He must find a cure with his immune blood to help the infected zombie-like creatures while avoiding them. The acting mostly by Will Smith is excellent. He did a great job playing a lone figure. The zombies were hideous looking and scary, but they could've done better with them. The scenery especially the abandoned NYC is spectacular. I don't know how they did the NYC scenes without any people. Overall this is a great film, but a bit scary for younger children. I rate this film a 10/10.",10,4,9,11 July 2008
The Bourne Legacy," Not the Bourne We Love,....But Still Thrilling!
","To be fair, it would take a lot to make a film like any of the films in the original Bourne trilogy. Like most people, I was dismayed when I heard Paul Greengrass and Matt Damon would not be back for the fourth film. But alas, they have found a way to continue the franchise. The fourth movie in the set, The Bourne Legacy happens to be a fair thriller that is better than anyone could hope for. Even though the plot seems murky and the script a little muddled, I'm glad to say that the absence of Matt Damon does not result in any failure.Tony Gilroy replaces Greengrass at the helm and as he worked with the first three films, Gilroy proves to be an apt director. The government is bent on destroying their program and that includes the termination of their agents. Aaron Cross escapes, and with Jason Bourne-like skills, he does all he can to get medication for himself and avoid the authorities.I think this film works because the acting is very strong. Jeremy Renner is no Matt Damon, but he is one of the most capable action stars today and shows off his moves here quite well. Rachel Weisz does a good job as the doctor and has a few pivotal scenes. Edward Norton essentially is the government baddie as he tracks down Cross and does well.Overall, this film is better than anyone could have hoped for, even with expectations set so high. There are several big action pieces here and some are quite lengthy. I think the best action sequence is at the start of the film with the battle between Cross, the alpha wolf, and the nuke. The cinematography is top-notch and luckily, there does not seem to be much shaky camera. While nowhere as impressive as the original trilogy, this film still packs quite a punch. I rate this film 8/10.",8,4,6,11 February 2014
22 Jump Street," It's College Time!
","22 Jump Street is the sequel to the surprise 2012 smash hit, 21 Jump Street. Just like the first film, the sequel is an action-comedy that takes place in college this time. It has a similar feel to the first film, but that is forgiven because this film is so massively entertaining and action-packed. The chemistry between Tatum and Hill is once again outstanding and their witty one-liners are the best. Also stay for the end credits, because even the credits manage to bring some hilarious moments. Phil Lord and Christopher Miller return to the sequel where Jenko and Schmidt are returning to Jump Street, but this time as members of a college. Once in college, their partnership is questioned when Jenko joins the football team and meets a new friend and when Schmidt joins the art department and falls in love. Despite this, they must somehow infiltrate a drug operation being ran on campus. Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill return to their respective roles and once again impressed me with their amazing chemistry. They are really funny and provided some good action scenes. I also liked the throwback jokes to Tatum's early acting career. Ice Cube as Captain Dickson was just mind-blowing funny. I also liked Jillian Bell as one of the students on campus. Just creepy funny she was. Overall, 22 Jump Street is just as good as the film which made this sequel happen. There is a little nostalgia factor added into the movie, but there is no resisting how awesome this movie is. The movie is just worth it alone of checking out the antics of the main actors. I really hope there is a sequel or thirty of them. My Grade: A-",9,1,4,13 May 2015
Dog Day Afternoon," Brilliant and Witty!
","The 1970's have been kind to Al Pacino because that was the decade that brought him to fame. He struck gold with the Godfather films but her also starred in Serpico and now this film, Dog Day Afternoon. This film is not like you would expect. I thought this film would be a thriller/action kind of film but this is actually a comedy, and a quite funny one. This movie is well-paced, sharp, witty, and features very good acting.Sidney Lumet's film is about a guy named Sonny and his dim-witted friend who decides to hold a bank hostage in order to get an operation for his gay lover. But when this plot is discovered, he won't go down without a fight.This film is well-acted. It has a great character study and it shows wide ranges of emotions. Al Pacino is excellent and makes a serious case on why he should have won Best Actor. He has some zany energy and his role comes across as realistic. The late John Cazale is really good and has some great one-liners.Overall, this is what cinematic gold is. It's a film that is all about the characters and what they do/how they feel. Not many films analyze in-depth on their characters as Dog Day Afternoon does. Some people may not like this because they wanted hardcore action. But those who expect cinematic beauty, this is for you. I rate this film 9/10.",9,0,1,18 June 2013
School of Rock," Hilarious!
","The School of Rock is a such a funny film. I remember seeing this through my childhood years after this came out. Now that I am a college student, I was still able to watch this film with extreme pleasure. School of Rock is the best musical ever, better than Grease or Sound of Music.This is about a lazy musician who is told to come up with rent money or he'll get kicked out. He decides to pose as a substitute teacher and teach his class the gift of rock and roll music.Jack Black is ...well Jack Black. I say that in a good way because I like his style of acting. The kids were pretty darn great. Sarah Silverman is great as the hothead girlfriend.Overall, this is the best musical I have ever seen. This will be one of my favorites for years to come. I rate this film 9/10.",9,0,0,10 November 2010
Cars 2," Decent Animation, But Definitely Not Pixar!
","Cars 2 is actually not a half-bad film as many people are claiming it to be. It's a sequel to the 2006's hit Pixar film, Cars. While Cars turned out to be weakest film Pixar has ever made, it still had a heart and a message. It was more about the drama and relationships between the characters rather than action. Unfortunately, this is the first Pixar film to lack that heart and to substitute it for plain action. As an action fan, I really liked this move. As a Pixar fan, I was wondering what the heck happened.Our heroes Lightning McQueen and Mater returns as they travel worldwide to race in the World Grand Prix. But while there, Mater seems to have been caught up in some kind of international conspiracy.The voice actors are pretty good. I wanted to see more Owen Wilson as McQueen because I felt he wasn't in the movie enough as this film was based more on Mater voiced by Larry the Cable Guy.Overall, this is a good movie if you don't associate it with Pixar. I enjoyed the action scenes and the crisp animation, but I couldn't help feel disappointed that this is not the Pixar film we have came to expect. I rate this film 7/10.",7,1,2,25 February 2013
Amadeus," Amazing!
","After viewing Milo Forman's Amadeus, I think this film has given me a greater appreciation for classical music. Everything about this movie is just about perfect. Everything in this film stood out to me whether it was the glorious acting, the wonderful costume design, or just the symphonies of Mozart themselves.This film is essentially about the last ten years of Mozart's life. This movie goes in detail about how an ordinary composer Salieri who is looking for greatness does not like Mozart simply because he longs for greatness.The acting is just wonderful. The relatively unknowns F. Murray Abraham and Tom Hulce were very good in the roles. I could feel their emotions, their pain just by watching the screen.Overall, this film deserves nothing but the highest praise. I am reviewing the director's cut, but that does not mean anything to me. At nearly three hours long, I was disappointed to see that the film was over. I rate this film 10/10.",10,0,1,28 December 2012
Kick-Ass," Awesome!
","I can't describe beyond words on how awesome this movie is. I waited for the DVD with the thought that this movie would not be good enough to see in theatres. I wish I saw this in theatres because this is one of the best movies I have ever seen. There is a good blend of comedy, action, and teen romance.This is about a teenage superhero who teams up with a adult superhero and his young daughter and together they fight the evil off in New York City.Now if you are expecting something like Batman or Superman, you will be wrong. These superheroes fight to kill unlike the fore-mentioned superheroes. This movie depicts tons of violence especially from the amazing 11-year old girl. But, I liked that.Overall, this is one of the best superhero movies ever. The only thing I hated was Nic Cage's haircut. I rate this film 10/10.",10,2,6,17 September 2010
Unknown," Crafty Thriller!
","Liam Neeson is turning into quite an action star these days despite his advancing age. After starring in the surprise action hit Taken, Liam tries his hand at another similar movie except with a much fewer body count. Unknown is a crafty little thriller set in international lands and is much better than I expected it to be. I thought this would be almost like a sequel to Taken but what I got was a tense, smartly-written thriller.This film is about a husband, Dr. Martin Harris and a wife, Liz who travels to Germany because of a press conference. After suffering in an accident, Martin wakes up to find out his whole world is turned upside down when he finds out his wife does not recognize him and an impostor has taken his place. Now, he has to face many challenges if he is to get things back to normal.Liam Neeson is making a name for himself as an action star. He was pretty good to watch in this movie. The supporting cast led by January Jones, Diane Kruger, and Frank Langella is really good as well.Overall, this is a tense thriller which is way better than the release date it had would suggest. This movie was slow at times and it reminded me greatly of Harrison Ford's Frantic, but despite some clichés, the cast and some tense moments rose this film above mediocrity. I rate this film 8/10.",8,27,31,25 January 2013
Ghostbusters," Funny and Original!
","Whwn I last saw this instant classic, I was hardly more than a child in kindergarten. I enjoyed the film back then, and I still enjoy the film eleven years later.This film is about three wacko scientists who have nothing to do. So they decided to chase and capture the supernatural for profit. Their business does OK, but a dilemma arises. They have to save NYC from evil ghosts.The acting is the film is just plain great. Bill Murray is one of the funniest guys from the 80's. He adds sarcastic humor to this film. The rest of the crew, I liked.Everything works with this film. The plot and dialogue are fantastic with each other. The special effects are great even to today's standards. I must say how wonderful the music is. I liked the score and of course, the song by Ray Parker Jr.Overall, this is a great film, a tad underrated. This is a great classic. I rate this film 9/10.",9,1,2,13 June 2009
Gran Torino," Powerful Movie!
","This is definitely in the top 3 of 2008 films. This movie is so great, I can hardly describe my feelings in words. Clint Eastwood did such a great job making a film that moves yous and that everyone would like.Clint Eastwood plays Walt. Walt is a racist Korean War veteran. His next door neighbor, a Hmong tries to steal his mint condition Gran Torino. He is caught by Walt and he instantly reforms the kid and protects his family from a threatening gang.The acting is very good. The only actor that everyone knows is the masterful Clint Eastwood. The Hmong actors are unknown but they did a n excellent job.The story keeps you on your toes, waiting what's going to happen next. The music is great. The song during the end credits is great. You even get to hear Clint sing.At 78, Clint still goes strong as a drinking, smoking, mean racist dude. Go Clint! I rate this film 10/10.",10,4,11,21 June 2009
Shrek the Third," My Favorite Shrek!
","Shrek the Third is my favorite one in the series even though I have yet to see the fourth one. This movie received so many negative reviews and I honestly cannot see why. If there was a Shrek movie to receive negative reviews, it should have been the second one.This time in the series Shrek is in line for the throne but he doesn't want to be king. He travels to seek the next heir, a boy named Arthur. When they come back to Far Far Away, they find that Charming is up to no trouble and he has taken control of the whole kingdom.The characters again are a welcome addition to this movie. Of course Donkey remains my favorite. I also liked Puss in Boots. The other characters are likable too.Overall, this is my favorite Shrek. I can't wait to see the fourth one. I rate this film 9/10.",9,4,6,15 November 2010
The Hurt Locker," Is This Best Picture Worthy?
","All in all, this is a good film. But I believe this should not have won 6 Oscars. In fact, I think only this film should have been nominated for only one Oscar and that's best actor. But, Avatar is so much better than this film and that should have won despite it's money-making glory.The plot's really simple. It's about a group of guys in Iraq whose missions are to destroy bombs before they go off.Now, the acting is really good. I believe Jeremy Renner deserved his nomination. I liked the cameos. All three of those actors are really good ones.I wanted more action here. There is more drama than action. But the drama is not bad. Overall, this is a good war flick. I rate this film 8/10.",8,12,18,16 June 2010
The Amazing Spider-Man 2," Spidey Is Back!
","I still have split feelings over the new Spiderman reboots. I loved the original trilogy, but I did like the first reboot even though it was the same origin story all over again. If I wanted a sequel, it would have been Spider-Man 4, but instead we get the Amazing Spider-Man 2. I won't lie when I say that I expected a complete disaster. I actually....liked this film even more so than the first one. It has plenty of strong action and I actually liked the romance between Peter Parker and Gwen Stacy this time around. The biggest fault I found with the movie is the overuse of villains. Sure, the Rhino is a good character, but save him for the next film! Marc Webb's returns Spider-Man/Peter Parker to the big screen as he and Stacy are graduating from high school. Peace in the city isn't to last as Oscorp plans on taking over the city. Peter has to face such villains as Electro and Rhino as well as balance the delicate duties of Spider-Man and Peter Parker.I think Andrew Garfield makes for a very good Spider-Man. He is more cocky than Maguire's take on Spider-Man, but I find his character more likable. Speaking of likable, Emma Stone makes for a fine Gwen Stacy and she has great chemistry with Garfield. Jamie Foxx does well as Electro, although his role bears strong resemblance to his role in the Soloist. Paul Giamatti has a good few scenes as the Rhino and likewise Dane DeHaan as Harry Osborne.Overall, the Amazing Spider-Man 2 is actually an entertaining superhero movie. It's not perfect of course since there are some flaws within the story, but I found the film to be just a tad better than the first reboot film. The action is there, the romance is there, and Spidey being a hero is of course there. The film also has a little bit of an surprising emotional charge. A good film to watch and better than I was led to believe.My Grade: B+",8,1,2,26 March 2015
Back to the Future Part III," Surprisingly Good!
","Usually these kind of movies don't fare well with critics, the audience, and the box office. I feel that this film had success in all these categories. I certainly felt this is a good way to end a classic series.This time, Marty McFly travels back to 1888 to rescue Doc. If Doc is not rescued, he will perish and history may be altered in one way or another.The acting is pretty good. Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd basically did as well as they did in the first two. Mary Steenburgen was a nice addition. It added some romance to the film.Now, the important thing is that this film is not as good as the first two films. Well, the plot/characters/acting/music are, but it did not give me the feel as I would normally feel while watching a classic.Overall, this is a grand finale to a great series. I would pick this movie as the best one. I rate this film 9/10.",9,1,1,13 May 2009
The Twilight Saga: New Moon," Not as Good!
","New Moon is not as good as the first movie in the series. I think it's the worse one but it's still decent. I enjoyed most of the movie even though I am a guy. Once again the dialog is pretty stupid. I was laughing at some of the dialog. Also the ending was terrible. I never seen a worse ending to a movie. But that's all the bad things about the movie.In this movie, it's pretty much a love triangle between Bella, Edward, and Jacob. It gets serious between Bella and Jacob when Edward and his family leaves town for good.The acting is pretty good. I read negative comments about Kristen Stewart and her acting. Well she's supposed to act depressed. And thats exactly how she was in the movie. I liked the Voluturi especially Michael Sheen. I am a big fan of his.Yes, there is some sappy romance here. But there is more action that held my interest. I liked this movie better than I thought. I rate this film 7/10.",7,1,7,20 February 2011
Patton," A Fascinating Look at a Flawed Man!
","From viewing the famous opening sequence of the 1970 war movie, 'Patton,' I knew what kind of epic I was in for. That opening sequence, with Patton addressing soldiers in front of a draped American flag, shows what kind of character General George S. Patton is. A bloodthirsty, vivid man who is overly fond of his colorful language as well as his hatred towards the Germans. This character is fully embodied by George C. Scott, who delivers such a mesmerizing performance. This is the oldest rule in the acting handbook, but I truly believe I was watching Patton barking orders on screen, not George Scott. I really enjoyed this sprawling war epic, which covered the years Patton served in the war. The film, while suggesting sympathy, tells an unflinching account about whom Patton was and why he wasn't well-liked amongst his superiors. Thanks to a wonderful screenplay by Francis Ford Coppola, the character of George Patton was brought to life on the big screen.Franklin J. Schaffner's film celebrates the life of one of America's finest, but most eccentric generals. The film travels from his conquests over General Rommel in Libya to his downfall which led him not leading the troops at Normandy due to his big mouth and an incident where he slapped a solider. But the film shows him getting back at it by defeating Germans left and right as he marches closer and closer to Berlin.George C. Scott had a wonderful career, but this may be his finest performance he has ever done. In a sense, Scott is almost like Patton. They share nearly the same kind of personality. Scott always seemed to have controversial comments. But that being said, Scott blended into the role of Patton very well. He definitely deserved that Oscar win. The other 'big' actor in the film is Karl Malden, who played General Omar Bradley. He really doesn't have much to do, except to play third wheel to Scott's Patton. But in that case, I believe it is okay here. After all, this film is about George Patton.Overall, Patton is an example on how to make an exemplary biography. It's an extremely wonderful movie thanks to a center magnificent performance by George C. Scott. This is also a war movie, but I was surprised at the lack of battle sequences. Now there were a few, but this was more character-focused than I expected. That is not a complaint, as I love these kind of movies. Now for what little battles we have, the sound and effects work were great. I also loved the score by Jerry Goldsmith, and his use of the pipe organ in the main theme honoring the religious overtone of Patton. This is a great movie that respectfully treats one of the most iconic names in American history.My Grade: A",9,1,2,12 October 2015
Fantastic 4: Rise of the Silver Surfer," A Fantastic Follow-up!
","The sequel of Fantastic Four is way better than I expected it to be. With all the negative reviews, I thought that this movie would be a piece of crap. The story starts when Reed and Susan are about to be married. Then, an unexpected visitor from outer space interrupts the proceedings. The four heroes along with the military and the venomous Doom must stop the mysterious Silver Surfer from destroying the planet. The acting in this film is great and possibly better than the first one. Doug Jones/Laurence Fishburne did a great job as the Silver Surfer. Ottman's music is good with a couple of great tunes. Chris Evans as Johnny Storm is hilarious. I hope that there is another sequel to this thrilling, great special-effects film. I rate this film a 10/10.",10,6,10,18 May 2008
Grudge Match," Rocky Versus Jake LaMotta!
","After many years of wishful thinking, we finally get to see the ultimate showdown of Rocky versus Jake LaMotta....to a degree. Obviously, the characters in Grudge Match are not the same characters listed above, but they are played by the same actors, thirty plus years later. The film itself is actually a very good film....if you can take older men with no shirts. But the film is an excellent drama and is a lot funnier that I thought it would be. There were some great, though somewhat cheesy lines of dialog. I like how the film is not just about boxing, but about the characters. In fact, the actual boxing scenes are relegated to only like twenty minutes, if that. Peter Segal's film is about two Pittsburgh boxers: Henry Sharp and Billy McDonnen who are the worst of boxing enemies. Sharp decides to retire early after being defeated by McDonnen. Thirty years later, fate comes a-calling when a promoter named Dante Slate Jr. offers each of them a good deal to bring one last fight to the table: to fight a grudge match.I thought the film had fine acting. Robert De Niro is a very talented actor and it was nice to see him back in the ring, 33 years after Raging Bull. Sylvester Stallone managed to do a good job bringing back his inner Rocky. Kevin Hart added a funny presence as the promoter, Dante Jr. Alan Arkin added lots of humor, admittedly most about old-age, to his elegant performance. Kim Basinger was very good as Sly's former lover and Jon Bernthal as De Niro's long-lost son. Overall, Grudge Match is actually a quite humorous and moving film that managed to stay entertaining. It doesn't reach the scale of Raging Bull and Rocky, but it's not meant to. That does not stop the film from making some excellent inside references to those classics. A very entertaining movie, though I could use an ending that was not so abrupt. I rate this film 9/10.",9,4,5,27 January 2015
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," Timeless Classic!
","This is a great film. It may be probably one of the best of the year. This movie was certainly not looked over by the Academy liked they did to the Dark Knight. This movie is almost perfect, but it's not perfect.This film has a basic concept. A guy is born old and as his life progresses, he gets younger. This is based on a short story by Fitzgerald.The acting and directing is phenomenal. Brad Pitt can act! It's amazing how they can transform him into an old man. Cate Blanchett also did a very fine job. Taraji Henson did a great job, too.The two things that stand out are the visual effects and makeup. They definitely made this movie much better. The music added some effect as well.My only complaint is that this movie is way too long and there are some scenes that should be cut because they are boring and useless.Overall, this is such a wonderful film! This is maybe Brad Pitt's best movie ever. I rate this film 9/10.",9,0,2,15 June 2009
Transformers," Fun, Fun, and More Fun!
","Transformers is a very fun movie to watch. I had such a blast watching this. It won't win any awards unless it's special effects based because of the type of movie it is. This is just a summer film to sit back, relax, and have a great time for two and a half hours.This is about a how machine-like aliens and humans bond together to save the Earth from destruction.Shia impressed me. I haven't been impressed with Shia before this movie. But this movie made me realize that Shia has the tools to be a great actor. Also Megan Fox is the number one hottie.This is what you call a typical Michael Bay movie. It's full of action, CGI, and a fun time.Overall, this is a great movie. I rate this film 9/10.",9,5,9,9 February 2011
Men in Black II," A Great Sequel!
","This is a good sequel, better than I expected it to be but the first movie is still better than this one. I was disappointed about a few things including the time length. This movie takes place five years after the first movie. Agent J has to bring back Agent K because only K knows about the mysterious 'Light' object.' They have to prevent the evil Serleena from stealing this object. Some of their allies include the famous worms and the singing Frank the pug. The cast did a great job with their parts. I liked Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith as the Men in Black dudes. Lara Flynn Boyle did a pretty good job as the wicked Seleena. I also have to give heads up to Johnny Knoxville as he proves that he can act. The music by Danny Elfman is great and appropriate for this movie. The movie has some comedy too. It was nice to crack up here or there. I was displeased at the time length. This movie was way too short for a movie in a genre such as Sci-Fi. Overall, this is a great sequel and I recommend this. I rate this movie 9/10.",9,4,9,19 December 2008
Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs," A Surprising But Great Movie!
","I don't know what really made me see this film. I just saw this film with my best friend out of my instincts. I must have really good instincts because I really enjoyed this movie. This has to be the best animated feature I saw this year(have not seen Up yet). This movie is just plain fun. It's nice to hear that little kids and older adults enjoyed this movie together. That usually does not happen.This film is based off the novel with the same name. The main character is a failure of an inventor. Everyone thinks he's an outcast. One day, he invents a food machine. Due to a problem, the machine goes into the clouds and starts raining food. But too much food can cause problems.This film certainly has a talented voice cast of Anna Faris, Bill Hader, James Caan, Al Roker, and more. They're all really good. Overall, this is a pleasant movie that got ripped by the Oscars. Where's the Best Animated Feature nomination? I rate this film 10/10.",10,1,2,11 February 2010
Lincoln," An Incredible History Lesson!
","For those of you who do not enjoy history or politics, I wouldn't watch this film. But for once, there is a historically accurate and rather entertaining film based on one of the greatest Presidents of the United States, Abraham Lincoln. This film will take you behind the scenes and in the mind of 'Honest Abe' as he tries to pass the Thirteenth Amendment in Congress. This film is beautiful film in many regards. It has blissful cinematography, a subtle but great score by John Williams, great direction by Steven Spielberg, and just top-notch, amazing acting.Spielberg directed a story about Abe which focused mainly in the last few months of his life. As the Civil War drags on, there is a battle between Lincoln's 13th Amendment which will end slavery and Democrats in Congress who are supporting the end of the war and not the bill.The one thing that carries a film like this is the acting and everyone puts on an acting clinic here. Let's start with Daniel-Day Lewis, the greatest actor of our generation. The passion he brings to each project is amazing and because of Daniel, we see what kind of man Abe was. I want to say this is his best role, but every role he's done, they just been so amazing. All I can say is that he deserves his Oscar for this film. Tommy Lee Jones as Thaddeus Stevens is wonderful and another great performance. Sally Field brings emotional depth as Mary Todd Lincoln in her amazing performance. We get good performances from Joseph-Gordon Levitt, David Strathairn, Hal Holbrook, James Spader, and so on. Such a wonderful cast assembled for this film.Overall, Lincoln is a politically-rich film, but we see the man Abe was as he was always telling stories, no matter his stress. He was a man with a sharp tongue and always had a plan. We see the fragile complexion of Mary Todd as she cares for her family. This is a passion project by Spielberg and through his direction of the film, we can tell. For those of you expecting action, don't watch this. It's very political and there are lots of a dialog, some which may seem dry. But, I was hooked on to every single word. This film brings emotion to the film and if this was not a movie, Lewis would be a perfect Lincoln. I rate this film 9/10.",9,4,6,2 May 2014
Rules of Engagement," Tense, Well-Acted Thriller!
","Rules of Engagement, directed by the great William Friedkin, is a great good, tense thriller. This movie happens to have two film genres working for it. The first half of the film is a war film and the second half is a tense courtroom drama which is very well-made despite many clichés we usually see in courtroom films. Also, this film has two very hard-working actors going for it: Tommy Lee Jones and Samuel L. Jackson.This film is about a former Vietnam soldier who is asked to evacuate an American ambassador from Yemen but while he is doing that, all hell breaks loose. This soldier when he gets back home, recruits his friend whose life he saved in Vietnam to be his lawyer, so he can prove his innocence showing that he did not shoot into a crowd of unarmed civilians.Tommy Lee Jones and Samuel L. Jackson are two of the most respected actors in the business today. They do very well in this film and with their abilities, they seemed liked they coasted through this film. They have very good chemistry working together. I also liked Guy Pearce as the prosecutor because he is also a well-respected actor. I wanted to see more of Ben Kingsley and Anne Archer because they were the plot holes of the film. There was one scene involving Jones and Archer where Jones ask her to be a witness, but nothing comes from that. That is the only problem I had with this movie.Overall, this is quite a tense film especially the latter part of it. This movie has many clichés but if they are filmed well, then they usually work. The early war scenes in both Vietnam and Yemen are action-packed. This is a film that relates to government corruption and the military style of today's world. I rate this film 9/10.",9,5,11,6 March 2013
Children of Men," Excellent Sci-Fi!
","Children of Men could be an accurate glimpse of the future of the world if we keep acting like we do. In the movie, it seemed like the only country left alive was Britain and soldiers there acted like the Nazis. That could be a taste of what to come. That is what made this movie so good to watch. It sends across a very powerful message.Clive Owen is Theo whose mission is to escort a pregnant lady out of the country before it's too late. This is the first pregnancy in eighteen years.The acting is pretty good. I am not a big fan of Clive Owen but he's decent here. I really loved Michael Caine as the weed-smoking hippie.Overall, this is great sci-fi thriller that will keep you to the edge of your seat. I rate this film 9/10.",9,1,7,26 September 2010
Million Dollar Baby," Great Drama!
","Million Dollar Baby is a great, moving story. This is a movie that sort of deserved the Best Picture award. Nearly all the actors did a fantastic job especially Clint Eastwood.Clint Eastwood stars as a grumpy boxing trainer. He trained some of the best over his long career. Then he meets a poor girl with ambition of winning boxing fights. But, Frankie is reluctant to train the girl, Maggie. He eventually gives in and things happen that are destined to change lives.As I said before, the acting is superb. Clint Eastwood, Morgan Freeman, and Hilary Swank all gave great performances.The story is a moving one. You do not have to be into sports to see and understand the intense drama. You should expect to have a few tears during this film.Overall, Clint Eastwood did a great job. He had a wonderful career acting and directing films. I rate this film 9/10.",9,5,6,27 March 2009
Donnie Brasco," Great, Underrated Mafia Film!
","I can't believe that I have never heard of Donnie Brasco. This is a great mafia film that I didn't expect much out of. I thought this would be a ripoff of the Godfather but it's not. I think it may be better than the Godfather.This is about an undercover FBI agent who goes by the name Donnie Brasco. He joins the mafia thanks to a father like figure, Lefty. Now with all his work, Donnie's life is about to go in turmoil.The acting here is great. This has to be one of Al Pacino's better movies. This ranks up there with the Godfather series and Scarface. Johnny Depp also has a knack of making great films.Overall, I was pleased at this film. If I never heard of a movie before, I generally don't see it. But since the plot looked appealing, I did. I'm glad I did because it's a great film. I rate this film 9/10.",9,4,5,28 October 2010
The Nightmare Before Christmas," Halloween Plus Christmas Equals......Fun!
","The Nightmare Before Christmas was produced during the heyday of Disney's Renaissance period and it is another example of a Disney classic. Now this isn't as strong as the Lion King or the Little Mermaid, but it's serviceable enough. This concept was created by Tim Burton and throughout the film, we can see his visionary touches. The visuals are very creepy and I also liked the music. The concept is a genius idea as we see what happens when Halloween and Christmas is combined. Henry Selick's film is about the Pumpkin King of Halloween Town named Jack who is not happy with the continuous tradition of Halloween. Jack stumbles into Christmas Town and falls in love with Christmas. Jack decides to get his buddies at Halloween Town to join in the festive spirit....but it may be a big mistake. The film doesn't feature a big voice cast at all, as the movie is mostly song. But composer Danny Elfman sung many of the songs and I thought he did a very good job. In any case, we do have talent from Chris Sarandon to Catherine O'Hara in this movie. Overall, The Nightmare Before Christmas is another strong movie for Disney. It's not perfect by any means, especially when it comes to the writing. The movie seemed to grow stale towards the end, so we must be thankful for the incredibly short running time. But in all, this was a very entertaining film thanks to the vision of Tim Burton. My Grade: B+",8,1,1,17 March 2015
"Good Night, and Good Luck."," Dry History Lesson!
","Good Night,and Good Luck is not a bad movie at all but it is a dry history lesson that's probably just as tolerable as listening to the history professor drone on and on. I can see talent used to make the film but I guess it never clicked with me. I was waiting for something interesting to happen but nothing really happened. I liked the idea on how they used black and white filming because it gives the film an authentic look for the time period it was in.George Clooney's film is about how Edward Murrow and his team do all they can to discredit Senator Joseph McCarthy and his communist claims about people infiltrating the American government.The film has a bunch of solid performances most notably David Strathairn. He really pulled out the stops to play Edward Murrow. He even acted the way the real Murrow did. The supporting cast led by George Clooney, Patricia Clarkson, and Robert Downey Jr did an awesome job. Even McCarthy did a good job since he played himself thanks to archive footage.Overall, this is a bland film despite it being pretty historically accurate. If they added a bit more to the film, it could have been better. This film literally put me to sleep and that never happens to me in movies. This film, despite being decent, is overrated and should have not been nominated for any Oscars. I rate this film 6/10.",6,2,3,28 March 2013
Dumb and Dumber," A Funny 90's Classic!
","Dumb and Dumber is a actually a pretty funny movie despite my intentions of not seeing this. This is not the movie that will win any Academy Awards, but if you want a drop in I.Q or you're just bored and want to see some comedy, this is the movie to see.This is one of the movies from 1994 that made Jim Carrey famous. The others were The Mask and Ace Ventura. Carrey plays Lloyd Christmas. He is a loser limo driver who fell in love with a passenger. She goes to the airport and leaves her briefcase. Along with his best pal Harry, Lloyd decides to go from Rhode Island to Colorado to return the case.It took me many years to see this movie because it looked ridiciously stupid. It is in a good way. Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels delivered fine performances. I rate this movie 8/10.",8,1,2,27 February 2010
The Boy in the Striped Pajamas," Powerful!!!!
","The Boy in Striped Pajamas is very powerful and moving. After viewing this movie, I remained stunned for hours on how good this movie is. This movie should have garnered some more Academy attention but everything is nearly if not totally perfect.This emotional film is about a Nazi soldier's family who moved to the countryside. The son Bruno, while exploring, stumbles upon a concentration camp. There is where he meets a Jewish prisoner his age and this is where the tale of friendship truly begins.The acting is just amazing! Asa Butterfield as Bruno simply cannot be bested here. The kid who plays the Jewish boy is almost as great. There were also stirring supporting roles played by Vera Farmiga and David Thewlis.This is not a film about concentration camps or Nazi Germany in a sense, it's more about a tale on extreme friendship and family. These themes are more prevalent in the final, shocking closing scenes.Overall, this a fantastic, powerful film. This is a movie all people should see. I rate this film 10/10.",10,1,1,16 September 2012
Brave," A Pixar Delight!
","The latest film from Pixar, Brave is another winning film to add to the books. Sure, it's not as good as Pixar classics such as the Toy Story trilogy or Wall-E, but it's still a beautifully-animated, well-written story. It's not that original, but it's a good step for Pixar choosing a strong female character as their central character. I liked the Celtic twist to this story because it made the film a bit more surreal and I love anything that has to do with Scotland.Brenda Chapman's film is about a girl named Merida who is the princess of her kingdom. Much to the dismay of her mother, she doesn't want to live the life as a princess. Merida sets out on an adventure to change the ways of her mother, but she unleashes much more than that.This film has a pretty good voice-cast. There's really no stars here, but there are quite a few recognizable names such as Kelly MacDonald, Billy Connolly, Robbie Coltrane, and Emma Thompson. They all do pretty good voicework since they are mostly English, not Scottish.Overall, this is a winning film of Pixar's in my book. Led by impressive visuals, a good story, moral themes, and a strong central female character, this is a delightful films for all ages to enjoy. It may be a little dark or action-packed for little kids though. But, any film that changes one's mother to a bear is a good film I believe. This isn't any Toy Story or Finding Nemo, but then again what is? I rate this film 9/10.",9,5,10,9 January 2014
Caddyshack," Mostly Funny!
","Caddyshack for the most part is a funny screwball comedy that began the train ride of comedies that would highlight the 1980s. I am not too fond of golf so actually enjoying the film came as a surprise to me. Some jokes just tried to hard, but other jokes had me laughing through the roof. My favorites are the gopher scenes and the scene spoofing Jaws with a candy bar in the pool.Harold Ramis's film has many subplots to the story. There is Danny, a caddy for a golf course who wants to go to college so he tries to win a scholarship. There is the assistant groundskeeper named Carl who tries to eliminate a gopher. There is a new member named Al who is crazy and constantly angers one of the founders, Judge Smails. There is also this talented golfer named Ty, who Danny regularly caddies for.The acting is pretty good I think. Chevy Chase did a swell job as Ty. Laid-back, but pretty funny. Rodney Dangerfield was hilarious as Al. Michael O'Keefe was pretty good as Danny. I thought Bill Murray was the highlight as the man trying to kill the gopher without such luck.Overall, Caddyshack is actually a pretty good film. There are more funny moments than not, although not every joke works. It works as a good sports spoof and I'm just glad it's not a straight-up golf movie. This movie is heralded as a cult classic and I can see why. This film almost works as a stand-up comedy show, which is not bad at all. I rate this film 8/10.",8,0,3,5 February 2015
8 Mile," A Nice Musical!
","8 Mile is a very good musical. I was reluctant to see this at first, but I got this on Christmas of last year so I had to see it. 8 Mile stars Eminem as a white rapper. He lives in Detroit and his whole life is messed up including family life. He appears in rap battles, but can't seem to win. All the sudden, his talent is recognized. What will happen? You just have to find out. First off, that acting was actually better than I thought. They all had great chemistry together. I liked Kim Cattrall as the mother. Second off, the music was great. I am not a big fan of rap music, but I liked the the songs especially 'Lose Yourself.' Finally, this movie has many apparent messages hidden through the plot. They focus on how to live up to your dreams. Overall, this is a great film. Children should be advised with all the cussing and use of drugs. I rate this film a 9/10.",9,2,3,28 April 2008
Shrek 2," Decent Sequel!
","Shrek 2 is a pretty good sequel to the first one but I think it's the worst of the series. It took me a few times of watching this to liken up to it. Now that I did, I really enjoyed this film more than I did the first time.This sequel is about when Shrek and Fiona travel to Far Far Away so she can introduce Shrek to her family. Unfortunately Shrek and the King do not get along. To make matters worse Shrek has to face dangerous foes in The Fairy Godmother and Prince Charming.I thought there were good jokes especially by my favorite character, Donkey. Puss in Boots is a welcome character and he made this movie work. I think the chemistry between Shrek and Fiona weakened a little from the first.Overall, this is a solid sequel. There are some great moments of comedy. I think the third one is better though. I rate this film 8/10.",8,0,1,15 November 2010
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," An Excellent Work of Art!
","Kill Bill Volume One has to be one of the surprising movies I have ever seen. I had no intention to see this because I was turned off by the previews and the previous Uma movie I seen before this was Batman and Robin and she was horrible. I'm glad I did because this is definitely an exciting film.This is about a former bride-to-be who is left for dead on her wedding day while everyone else is killed. When she wakes up, she decides to go out for revenge.I was skeptical of Uma at first because of her Batman and Robin role but the moment she appeared that thought vanished from my mind. I really liked the fight scenes at the end featuring Lucy Liu.This movie is very violent. I would not recommend this movie to young children of course. It's very gory and I liked it.The music is here is very good. It sounded like some traditional instruments were used in the score.Overall, this is a very good action movie. I am highly anticipating the second one. I rate this film 10/10.",10,2,5,3 November 2010
From Dusk Till Dawn," A Tale of 2 Genres!
","From Dusk Till Dawn is a masterful tale that mixes and matches up two successful genres very well: the hardcore crime drama and fantasy horror. The first half of the film incorporates some hard-boiled crime drama and some Taratino-influenced dialog. The second half, however more generic, is still a joy to watch especially with all the vampire action. So what I'm trying to say is that this film is an awesome 'B' movie and is a fun, action-packed adventure.Robert Rodriguez's film is about two notorious brothers, the Gecko Brothers who kidnap a former priest and his two kids to escape across the border. While at a bar in Mexico, they come to realize that this bar holds house to extreme evil so they must gang up to defeat these creatures of Satan.The acting is pretty good and juicy. George Clooney shows in his first film role what a charismatic actor he is. Harvey Keitel and Juliette Lewis are pretty good in their roles as well. Even though I don't see Taratino as an actor, he gives a juicy and raw performance as the younger Gecko Brother.Overall, this film is an example of a pure 'B' film. This film provides all the giddy fun you come to expect. The vampire designs are actually quite terrifying and semi-realistic. This is one of those films that successfully mixes two genres and escapes unscathed. I had a fun time with this film and I liked the balance of crime, horror, and drama. I rate this film 9/10.",9,0,1,27 November 2013
The Last Emperor," This Film Can Be Fascinating!
","If you can sit through this movie, especially the three and a half version of this film, I am proud of you. Not to say this movie is bad, but it's often tedious since there is really nothing here to move the plot. The film goes at such a slow pace, but however this film can be incredibly fascinating and the film is enriched with detail. As a history buff, I enjoyed this film as it was because of the historical narrative it induced.Bernardo Bertollucci's film is about the last emperor of China before the warlord age and communist age. The film talks about how Puyi became emperor at such an young age, how he abdicated this throne, and how he ended up as a political prisoner.The acting is really good and we needed good acting to get through a film like this. John Lone does an excellent job as the adult Puyi and really conveys his emotions very well. Peter O'Toole, one of the few Western actors here, does an excellent job as always.Overall, The Last Emperor seems like it does not have in mind to entertain, but to teach. It's a good, fascinating film that talks about changing times and how people must adapt. I was intrigued by this film because the dynasties of China has always impressed me. Is this the film that should win Best Picture at the Oscars? Perhaps not, but this is still a good film to see despite it's tepid pacing. I rate this film 8/10.",8,3,3,26 May 2014
Jerry Maguire," Overrated!
","Jerry Maguire is perhaps the most overrated film of any Oscar winner. I'm not saying that this film is bad, but it's not really that great either. Basically, this film is a decent chick flick with elements for men and women.Tom Cruise plays a sports agent similar to baseball's Scott Boras. He eventually loses his job and it's up to a football player played by Cuba Gooding Jr. to find himself.The acting is great. Maybe Gooding does deserve an Oscar. Tom Cruise once again did something right. This film also boosted Renee Zellweger's career.The reason this film is overrated because the story is lame. You see the same thing happening in almost every chick flick. Gets boring after awhile.I did like the music. There are some great tunes by Bruce Springsteen.Overall, this is a decent flick. Why it got nominated for 5 Oscars, I don't know. I rate this film 7/10.",7,1,3,26 June 2009
Here Comes the Boom," Your Average Family Film!
","Here Comes the Boom is a good, light-hearted film that offers up some quality family-time entertainment. It's very clichéd and predictable but the charm of Kevin James is to hard to resist and it has a good number of laughs. It's also a feel-good film that has the main theme of doing anything you possibly can to help others or institutions in need. The fighting matches are well-choreographed and worth watching despite some predictable outcomes.Frank Coraci's film is about a schoolteacher named Scott Voss who decides to participate in the UFC in order to raise money to save his friend's and fellow teacher's music program.The acting isn't too bad in the film. Kevin James is very charming here and has persona you can't resist. Of course he does the usual 'fat guy gets punched constantly' cliché, but it still was entertaining. Salma Hayek is good as Jame's love interest and I kind of liked the romantic interplay between these two. Finally, Henry Winkler does a good job and is often quite funny.Overall, Here Comes the Boom is a solid family flick that has some cool UFC fighting scenes. It's predictable but it's charming enough to be forgiven. It has several funny jokes, especially regarding the issue of American citizenship. I must say when the movie was over, I was in a good mood because of this film. A charming, entertaining film. I rate this film 8/10.",8,0,1,7 April 2014
Clash of the Titans," 'Release the Kraken!'
","The line I posted for the summary title, whether you like it or not, has to be the corniest line in the history of movies. But, I like that line delivered by Liam Neeson as Zeus. I think that's what stood out in the movie other than the CGI.This movie is a remake of the 1981 original. It's about Perseus who goes on a quest to rid Ancient Greece from the evil of Hades.I have mixed reactions on the acting. Some were excellent such as Liam Neeson or Ralph Fiennes who reminded me of Lord Voldemort from the Harry Potter films. Sam Worthington i think is miscast. He looked like the same guy from Avatar.This movie is what I call a good popcorn film. There is impressive action and CGI(especially to the kraken). The script and some of the acting is mediocre. But, most people including myself likes that kind of film. I can't wait for the second one in 2012. I rate this movie 8/10.",8,1,2,12 September 2010
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," Better than the Original!
","Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is a great summer film. I was reluctant to see this at first, but my friends persuaded me to see it. I was not disappointed. Charlie lives with a poor family in a shack. Nothing good ever happens to that family. But one day, Charlie finds money and he brought a chocolate bar. He found a golden ticket inside. He and 4 other children are brought to Wonka's factory where there many unusual things happen. This film is one of the better films on my list. The acting was tremendously good. I never thought that Johnny Depp could play Wonka as well as Gene Wilder in the original. Burton did a good job directing this film. Danny Elfman did a great job composing a momentous score. This film is for all ages, but little children might find this movie a little scary. I rate this film a 10/10.",10,5,9,10 December 2007
Mission: Impossible II," Much Better Than the First!
","I saw this movie with low expectations that this movie would be bad because the first film was so-so and these kind of sequels tend to become bad. Also, I heard plenty of negative reviews about this film. But, it turns out that the second time around is better than the first time.Tom Cruise returns as Ethan Hunt, one of the best action guys that are out there. The deadliest disease in the world has been created and there are limited amounts of antidotes. Hunt recruits a sexy sidekick to help retrieve the antidotes. The acting is better than I thought. Tom Cruise did an excellent job as Hunt. Thandie Newton did a good job, but I never got used to her playing her role. I'm glad Ving Rhames returned. Even Anthony Hopkins did a great job. There is no real plot to this movie because the movie is solely an action movie. There are great special effects and the motorcycle scenes were entertaining to watch.Overall, this is a great movie and I hope the third film is even better than this film. I rate this film 9/10.",9,3,6,6 February 2009
The Adjustment Bureau," Stylish and Spectacular!
","The Adjustment Bureau is actually one of the better romantic thrillers I have seen lately. It helps that there were science fiction elements thrown in to help boost the film. There are many things why this movie was good as it was. It had superb chemistry by Matt Damon and Emily Blunt, it had an intriguing plot line thanks to Philip K. Dick, and it has stylish directing by George Nolfi.This film is about a politician who risks everything he worked for and even his life as he tries to be with the girl of his dreams.As I mentioned previously, Matt Damon and Emily Blunt had very good chemistry. I just loved that one scene where they met each other for the first time. That scene worked very well and ultimately, it led to a very well-made film.Overall, this is a fine romantic thriller that features one of the most interesting plots I have seen. This is mostly a chick flick in disguise, but it has some drama and action to make up for it. I am surprised to see how many people dislike this film because it's not Bourne-like. Also, people seem to dislike all the religious implications as well. Well, I just liked the film the way it was: a nice, interesting thriller. I rate this film 9/10.",9,2,3,26 January 2013
World Trade Center," An Emotional Experience!
","World Trade Center is a breathtaking, emotional film that brings back the memories of the horrific events that happened to America almost eleven years ago. I can't believe it has been eleven years since that fateful day and that it took me almost six years to watch this film. This is a film that will stay in my heart for the rest of my life.This is about how two Port Authority police officers are trapped under the rubble of the Trade Center buildings and how it takes every ounce of them just to stay alive.Nicolas Cage and Michael Pena deliver two very emotional performances. I was in awe of just how well they depicted these heroes. The supporting cast led by Maggie Gyllenhaal also give moving performances.Oliver Stone directed a heck of a masterpiece. I can't believe this movie scored so low, but it is hardly surprising. After eleven years, it is still hard to recall those events of 9/11.Even though this is an excellent, well-done movie, I might not have the nerve to watch it again. I rate this film 10/10.",10,3,6,10 March 2012
Black Hawk Down," This film was alright
","I just got this film on DVD and I was excited about viewing this film. I was a little disappointed, but not much. I liked Pearl Harbor better. This film is based on an actual event where the US gets mixed up in a civil war in Somalia. First, I will start with the positives. The acting was great. I liked Harnett and McGregor. There is non-stop action. I also liked the score, but it is not really noticeable because you are dazzled by the visuals and action. There are also some negatives. There is poor character development. The movie doesn't try to explain the characters. Harnett's character should've been more explained. Next, the film is a bit too gory. But, I was fine with that. Overall, this movie is a fair war flick. I rate this movie a 7/10.",8,1,6,8 December 2007
The Hangover Part II," Predictable But Hilarious!
","The second installment in the Hangover franchise is very predictable since it almost exactly follows the plot line from the first film, but for some whatever odd reason, I laughed more in this film and thought the gags were a little better. The first film is a comedy classic, but this is just the film you wouldn't want to take too seriously. My favorite character in this film was the capuchin monkey because he was adorable and funny.Todd Phillip's film reunites the wolf pack from the first film and this time sends them to Thailand for another wedding, which is Stu's this time. After a supposed-to-be-innocent campfire, the gang wakes up in Bangkok in deep trouble as they are having yet another hangover. It all goes bad to worse when they realize the brother of Stu's wife-to-be is missing.The actors have really great chemistry and they feed off each other's energy. Bradley Cooper reprises his role as Phil and he is great again. Zach Galifinakis makes the perfect Alan since he is so weird. I just loved Alan's weirdness and that dinner scene where he is reading those notecard facts. Ed Helms is also really good as Stu who wants to take it easy but is resisted. I liked Ken Jeong's return somewhat but I found him more annoying in this movie than funny.Overall, this film is on par with the original film, maybe even a little funnier. This has a way darker tone as most films do these days but I was pleased there were many jokes here to counter that. Despite it's predictability, I laughed and laughed. I'm ready for the third film as long as it has something different. I rate this film 9/10.",9,5,8,16 February 2013
A Bug's Life," Very Good Piece of Animation!
","A Bug's Life is a very good animated feature. This movie is for younger children, but it is also a great movie for people my age. The story is about an ant named Flik. He brought havoc onto his colony when he destroyed the food that were for the superior grasshoppers. He gets banished and he must find bigger bugs to fix the mess. This movie is a classic because it is a good movie and it is a Pixar movie. The animation is brilliant especially for the late 90's. The story is good, but a little more detail would be suffice. The voice acting is good as with most animation movies. The music is nice to listen to. Nothing special, but it earned an nomination for one of the music categories. Overall, this movie struck me as awestruck. This is a good movie for all families. I rate this movie 10/10.",10,5,6,8 October 2008
Rudy," The Impossible Becomes Possible!
","One of the most inspirational sports film of the past three decades is this film, Rudy. Rudy is a real-life story about a guy who was deemed unfit for college football and was able to prove his naysayers wrong. Now like most sports film, I can see from a mile away the outcome of the movie, but it doesn't really make a difference, There were still some emotional moments to be had as we see this young man's dreams come true. This film also does a good job in raising my interest in football, because these are the kind of inspirational stories I love.David Anspaugh's film is about a young adult named Rudy who aspires to play football for Notre Dame. But there are many factors standing in his way such as his lack of athleticism, living in a town where everyone works for the steel mill, lack of support from his family, and not able to afford an college education. But one day when he is finally admitted to Notre Dame, Rudy proves that he has what it takes to follow his dreams.The acting is very good. Sean Astin, in his pre-Sam days, gives a very strong performance as Rudy. The great Ned Beatty likewise delivers a great performance as Rudy's father. Charles S. Dutton gives a great performance as Rudy's boss/mentor who believes in him. Finally, Robert Prosky makes a good appearance as the priest who helped Rudy find his way.Overall, Rudy is an incredibly inspirational movie about a man who is able to follow his dreams. It is a phenomenal movie and quite sentimental. The movie is not about football, but about the themes I mentioned earlier, although this helped me raise my awareness towards the sport. From the technical standpoint, the movie works very well. I especially liked the score composed by Jerry Goldsmith. This is a very good film, and one of the best sports films of recent years. I rate this film 9/10.",9,0,1,17 December 2014
Prisoners," Still at a Lost for Words!
","I still remember how I reacted after seeing Prisoners for the first time when it was released in theaters. It was one of the best thrillers I have ever seen and it was a disturbing watch. Now viewing it for a second time, those thoughts stay the same. The two and a half hour long movie takes the slow burn approach in telling the story, but that makes it even the better. Roger Deakin's cinematography is very effective as he draws on bleak, cold colors to bring us a constant sense of foreboding. I have never seen a movie as tense and it was almost a relief when the credits finally rolled up. But this is the kind of movie that will stay with you for weeks on end.Denis Villeneuve's film is about a man named Keller Dover who does all he can including bending the law to find his missing daughter who just suddenly disappeared with her friend after Thanksgiving dinner. There is Detective Loki who is assigned to the case and he must keep an eye on Keller while he puts all of his effort in finding the missing girls.There are no words to describe the acting of the film because it's just so darn good. Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhaal are the stars of the show as they deliver career-best performances. Hugh is fantastic as the screaming and clawing Dover who goes beyond the law to achieve his means. Gyllenhaal is the smart detective whose mannerisms including those facial tics are part of the character and his personality. Terrence Howard and Viola Davis deliver magnificent performances as the other kidnapped girls parents. Paul Dano was excellent as one of the suspects who can hardly utter a word. Finally, Melissa Leo is beyond recognizable as she delivers a creepy performance.Overall, Prisoners is not entertaining in a sense you would call a blockbuster, but it's a character study that shows what a parent would do to protect his loved ones. It's an undeniably a hard watch, but it may be worth that. This is the kind of film that you will never forget and it's a shame how this film got snubbed by the Academy. This is a foreboding, dark crime thriller and is one of the best films of 2013. Also for that ending......well it's an open book and everyone may have their own interpretations. I didn't like it too much the first time around, but it grew on me for the second time. The film surely packs a punch. I rate this film 10/10.",10,0,1,9 December 2014
Hotel Transylvania," Better Than Expected!
","Hotel Transylvania is actually a decent family film and that is something I never expected to say considering that this is an Adam Sandler film. But yes, it's a decent family film that has colorful animation, a good story to tell and one that will bring out the kids in adults, has some funny moments, has a solid voice cast, and has some good moral themes.This film is the debut for director Genndy Tartakovksy and not a bad debut at all. This film reunites all our favorite monsters such as Dracula, Frankenstein, and the Mummy in a kid-friendly way. Dracula has created a hotel for monsters in order to avoid humans. Dracula's daughter is celebrating her 118th birthday and that is when she will meet a human boy for the very first time....This film boasts a colorful voice cast and they seemed to have a fun time. It's rare for Adam Sandler to foray into animation and children films at the same time, but he actually does a good job here. His usual friends such as Kevin James, David Spade, and Andy Samberg are here as well.Overall, this is a film that surprisingly, both adults and children should both like. It's nothing special, but it's not the disaster people were predicting. It's funny despite several lame jokes(looking at you bleh, bleh, bleh.) It aims to be a good family movie and it certainly achieves that goal. I rate this film 8/10.",8,1,4,15 March 2014
Big Fish," Tim Burton's Masterpiece!
","Big Fish is no doubt one of if not the best movie Tim Burton has ever made. This is such a masterpiece! Maybe I say that because it's different, strange, moving, and it's not like the traditional movie audiences watch in this time period.This is about how Edward Bloom's son is trying to find out the truth about his father because it seems that Ed Bloom always tell stories about himself and would never tell the truth.This is a very wonderfully acted movie. I was engrossed in all the characters. Albert Brooks makes a very convincing old Bloom. Danny DeVito kind of reminded me from his role as The Penguin in Batman Returns but much more kinder.Overall, this is a heartwarming story that people should love. Tim Burton is a masterful, visionary director. The score by Danny Elfman is one of his best too. I rate this film 10/10.",10,0,0,27 December 2011
The Insider," Excellent Corporate Drama!
","The Insider is one of the better if not the best corporate dramas I have ever seen. It's tense, taut, thrilling, and even has some chilling moments. I never thought a movie that deals with the issue of cigarettes would turn out to be such a fascinating film, but as usual I was wrong. Not only was this film wonderfully acted, it had a steady pace, a well-written script, and wonderful directing by Michael Mann.Michael Mann's film is about a tobacco industry whistleblower named Jeffrey Wigand who got fired from his job and he decides to testify against the company thanks to the efforts of Lowell Bergmann and his 60 Minutes crew and the American legal system. However the careers of Wigand and Bergmann might be on the line if this goes out to the public.Al Pacino and Russell Crowe are two very talented actors that have blessed us with their screen talent over the years. Pacino seems to have gotten better with age and he showcases great acting in the film. Russell Crowe has a memorable performance as Wigand. He does a good job playing the shy, not-wanting-to-talk type of people.Overall, they have found away to make corporate dramas interesting as proved here. This could have easily been a dry, boring movie but the subtle directing by Mann makes this a thriller that will keep your mind and heart racing. However, I want to mention that although this is based off a true story, there are some changes made for dramatical purposes. But still, I don't go to the movies for a history lesson, but for enjoyment. I rate this film 9/10.",9,2,3,17 March 2013
Quiz Show," Very Intelligent Film!
","Robert Redford's Quiz Show is a pretty decent film that has some social, economic, and political morals to share. This drama is mostly riveting and it has an interesting story to tell. It's well-directed film by Redford who turned out to be a good director. The acting is great by everybody. My only problem is this film runs a little too long and it seems stale at some points.Redford's film is based off a true story. In 1958, NBC started a game show craze especially with their hit show 21. When champion Herb Stampel is kicked out and replaced by the popular Charles Van Doren, NBC comes under fire as it's revealed that the champions may have been given the answers to the questions.As mentioned before, the acting is phenomenal. John Turturro and Ralph Fiennes are great in their respective roles as the champions. David Paymer certainly makes a slimy guy. I was very surprised to see Martin Scorcese in an acting role, but I was very pleased.Overall, this is a decent film that goes on about corruption. Despite some staleness, I rather liked this film. It's not the best film of 1994, but it's easily entertaining. As for the subject matter, it's very hard to make a good mainstream film with it. But, somehow Robert Redford did it. I rate this film 8/10.",8,0,0,25 July 2013
The Dark Knight," Very, Very, Very Good!
","This is the best movie of 2008 and possibly the best movie I have ever seen. This movie rivals the third Lord of the Rings movie for my favorite motion picture. After you see this, you will never view Batman in the same way even if you hate Batman. The new villain in this movie is no other than what Jack Nicholson played in the original Batman, the Joker. The only words to describe the Joker and the late Heath Ledger's performance is: shockingly amazing. If you do not feel anything like the chills when the Joker is on the screen, I regret to inform you that you must have something wrong. The Joker is not the normal, ruthless evil guy. He is much more than that. The other actors did a fine job in their respective parts: Christian Bale as Batman, Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox, Michael Caine as Alfred, Maggie Gyllenhaal as Rachel( a good improvement over Katie Holmes), Gary Oldman as Gordon, and Aaron Eckhart as Two-Face/Harvey Dent. The overall tone of the movie is way darker that Batman Begins. There is more action and even some humor(from the Joker.) The car chases are great, too. The music is appropriate for the tone. The score by Zimmer and Newton-Howard is deeper, darker than what you would expect. If this movie could win one Oscar, the award should go to Heath Ledger as Best Supporting Actor. We'll see what happens in February. Overall, this is a fantastic film that is more violent that Batman Begins. I rate this movie 10/10, should be 100/10.",10,7,16,17 December 2008
Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix," Darker, Moodier But Rushed!
","Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is a great movie, no doubt about that. The only thing that went wrong is the how the movie was adapted from the novel. Many action-packed scenes were left out. Any way, Harry goes for Year 5 at Hogwarts and he must endure the hateful Umbridge and teach some students magic that Umbridge refuses to teach. The acting in this film is the best. Radcliffe did a good job showing Harry's emotions from the book. Everyone else was good as well. The technical aspects(cinematography, camera work etc) of the film is fantastic. The score is not that bad. Hooper put together a nice piece of work. There should've been more scenes that were in the book including Quidditch(Weasley Is A King, Fight with Malfoy), the Rita Skeeter interview, and the explosive anger towards Dumbledore. Other than that, this is a good film. I rate this film a 9/10.",9,1,2,4 July 2008
Into the Wild," An Emotional Story!
","Back in middle school, I was assigned the novel this movie is based on and it truly touched me each time I read it. When I saw that the book will be made into a movie, I was delighted. Unfortunately, I had to wait over a year to watch the film. I ended up liking this film, not as much as I wanted to, but still enough.The story is about Christopher McCandless. He is an unique person who believes that each individual should enjoy personal freedom. After he graduated college, he gave away his life savings and ditched his family to travel to Alaska. Along the way, he met some wonderful people and actually went to Mexico for a little bit. But how will Chris survive Alaska? The cast of this film is absolutely fantastic. Emile Hirsch, Jena Malone, William Hurt, Marcia Gay Harden, Catherine Keener, Kristen Stewart, Vince Vaughn, and Hal Holbrook each gave great, believable performances. I enjoyed the music as well since you hear Eddie Vedder songs throughout the movie. If you enjoy scenery, this movie is for you. The scenery is gorgeous and beautiful.I give this movie a 9 because some of the movie seemed a little boring. I am not thrashing this film but I couldn't help keeping track of the time. I really enjoyed this film. I rate this movie 9/10.",9,0,2,18 January 2009
Annie Hall," Better Than Anticipated!
","Before viewing this movie, I saw that this film is a much-liked American classic and a Best Picture winner at the Oscars. I never seemed too interested in Woody Allen movies but after watching Annie Hall, I think I might just be interested. This film is a really good film with very witty dialogue and great lead acting.This film is about a stand-up comedian who falls out of a relationship with the girl he loves. Now he must piece together the facts on why their relationship ended.Woody Allen's character started annoying at first in my eyes but in the end, I grew on him. Diane Keation was very good in her role. Her performance was almost perfect. The two leads had very good chemistry between them.Overall, this is a borderline great movie that goes in-depth on relationship issues. There were times when I thought this film was a bit slow, but I could see the masterful techniques used in the making of this movie. I loved the fact that this film has very memorable lines and funny moments. I rate this film 8/10.",8,0,0,27 December 2012
2001: A Space Odyssey," Greatest Sci-Fi Film of All Time!
","If there is any true masterpiece film out there, it's none other than 2001: A Space Odyssey. This film is not made to entertain, but to awe and inspire. This film not only knows how to tell such an amazing story, but this film is widely recognized for it's visual effects. Even in today's computer digital age, I was very impressed. The special effects added a whole new dimension to as what we know as film today. This film is a piece of art and it has many interpretations on what humanity was in the past and will be in the future.Stanley Kubrick's film is a tale spanning many millennia. After a stranger obelisk was discovered by our primate ancestors, we head to a colonized space where a group of astronauts and super-machine HAL embark on a crucial mission to Jupiter.This film doesn't have many big name stars here, practically none at all. Keir Dullea is practically the only person we get to know and he does a pretty good job. He does lots of interacting with HAL and is crucial to the important man vs. machine part of the film.Overall, this is nothing short of perfect. I'm sad there are not any films like this one being made too often. This is a space opera, a mini-horror film, and an awe-inspired film combined in one. The scene involving Keir traveling through the wormhole is just one of the greatest. If you have love for cinema, this should be on the top of your list. It pains me to say that this film will easily bore the average movie-goer, but this is a true work of art. I rate this film 10/10.",10,1,4,28 January 2014
Toy Story," Ground Breaking Animation!
","Toy Story is hands down the best animated film of all times. It's also a groundbreaking film with computer animation and it allowed more movie producers to explore the art. Fortunately that did happen because nowadays animated movies are staples in movie making.This is about a toy cowboy named Woody who is the favorite toy of his owner, Andy. He gets jealous when Andy gets a new toy, Buzz Lightyear. It only gets worse when both of them are missing and get stuck in evil Sid's room.The voices of Tom Hanks and Tim Allen are probably the best well-known voices in animated films.The music by Randy Newman is fantastic. The songs and score alike are fantastic and memorable.Overall, this is the best animated film of all times and it spawned two very good sequels. I rate this film 10/10.",10,0,0,4 February 2011
Blood Diamond," Truly Moving Film!
","If you buy a ring or any kind of jewelry that are worth thousands of dollars, check out this movie first. In regards to that aspect, this movie is entirely nonfiction. Movie-wise, this is an excellent film. The main actors did a really nice job. The pace diminish somewhat in the latter part of the film, but it doesn't really matter.There is a civil war brewing in Sierra Leone. The opposing side has slaves working in mines to find diamonds to make profit. They treat the slaves badly. Some Americans are in the country trying to find the diamonds. This story focus on a resident fisherman whose family has been taken away.The acting is very good. I enjoyed all the acting skills, especially by Leonardo DiCaprio and Djimon Hounsou. Some of the scenes were very moving especially what happens to the fisherman's son. There is a good amount of violence, which should be expected. The score by James Newton Howard is somewhat unusual for him, but this new style works.Edward Zwick, the famed director of The Last Samurai and Defiance, did a very good job. This movie should have won a few Oscars. I rate this film 9/10.",9,0,1,16 January 2009
Men in Black," Great Sci-Fi Flick!
","Men in Black is a great movie, especially for sci-fi/fantasy geeks. Several things make this movie work. They are superb acting, great music, and excellent alien visuals. Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith star as two agents from an agency that deals with aliens as Agent K and Agent J. J is the rookie of the group so K must train him to be a successful agent and possibly be even more. They have to deal with a bug who took a dead man's body to find a jewel and deliver the jewel to a battalion just off Earth or the planet will be blown to pieces. The acting is excellent. Will Smith is the best and Tommy Lee Jones is not far behind him. The score by Elfman is great to listen to. I also liked the Grammy-nominated song by Will Smith. The makeup and alien visuals are great and not stupid like most cheesy sci-fi flicks. This is a very good movie! I rate this movie 10/10.",10,3,4,28 November 2008
The Graduate," A Resonating Story!
","If there is one movie from the 1960's that my family loves to rave about, it's this film, the Graduate. I can see why my family loves this film. It's a coming-of-age film set in the time period my parents grew up. A childhood classic, my father would say. As for myself, a generation or two later, I found this to be mostly a great film. If I had a complaint, I would say the film is very outdated and it grew old..fast. But the themes of post-college troubles are very much prevalent in today's world. I liked this film not only because of resonating themes, it's the movie that introduced us to the careers of a legendary director in Mike Nichols and a fantastic actor in Dustin Hoffman. I also liked the soundtrack created by the folk-rock duo, Simon and Garfunkel. Their songs are very catchy and easy to hum along to. Of course, now we all know where the song, 'Mrs. Robinson' comes from.Mike Nichol's film is about a young man named Ben who has just graduated from college. His parents expect great things out of him. At a homecoming party, he drives the wife of his father's business partner home and he begins an affair with Mrs. Robinson. But things get complicated when he falls for a girl named Elaine. But Elaine happens to be the daughter of Mrs. Robinson! The film is very well-acted. Anne Bancroft does a wonderful job as the sexy, manipulative Mrs. Robinson. Dustin Hoffman shows everyone why he is a great actor. He kills every scene he is in. I think Katherine Ross did a solid job as Elaine, although we don't meet her until late in the film. For those who are fans of the 90's TV Show 'Boy Meets World,' you may recognize Mr. Feeney himself, William Daniels as Ben's father.Overall, The Graduate may be a bit old and weary, but it tells such a wise story with great acting and fantastic music, that it's hard to not see pass those rusty pipes. As I said before, this film has themes that are easily prevalent nearly fifty years after the film's release. It's one of those coming-of-age stories that shall stand the test of time, even if only because of the themes. This is a very memorable film to say the least.My Grade: B+",8,6,8,16 September 2015
Puss in Boots," Entertaining Family Fare!
","While not being the best film DreamWorks Animation has ever made, Puss in Boots is a good, warm-hearted animated feature that will easily entertain family audiences. This movie is a spin off film about one of the supporting characters in the final three Shrek movies, Puss in Boots. This film lacks the heart and bigness of those films, but still manages to get me entertained and I'm always happy to see any characters from the Shrek films.Chris Miller's film is about the lovely cat, Puss in Boots. In this storyline, which is not devoid of fairy-tale references, Puss joins up with Humpty-Dumpty and Kitty Soft-Paws to go after the evil Jack and Jill who are on the quest for magical beans.The voice acting is solid. Antonio Banderas is the only one who can play Puss in Boots. Salma Hayek, Zack Galifinakis, and Billy Bob Thornton are all nice additions to the cast and they voice their characters well.Overall, this is a good animated feature which is bound to receive much love from the younger children. Anyone else, especially those who are Shrek fans, should find this film pretty enjoyable. There's nothing new that was brought to the table, but it has enough wit and charm to make it an entertaining night out at the movies. I rate this film 8/10.",8,3,4,8 May 2013
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," Strange, But Good!
","I think that Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is a great film if not a bit quirky. Jim Carrey as Joel and Kate Winslet as Clementine meet each other at a train station and ended up dating. But soon after, Clementine has here mind erased of Joel. Saddened, Joel decides to have the same procedure. But Joel finds that the mind eraser can be a bad thing, in his case. This film have strange aspects because there has never been a movie like this before. The acting is superb. Seeing Jim Carrey serious is something you won't see every day. All the actors had great chemistry together. The score was also 'new.' There is a new hype added into the music. The only reason I gave this a 8/10 because the plot is confusing and it still confuses me after a couple times viewing. It goes to flashback, then current, then flashback, etc. It is interesting, though. I rate this film a 8/10.",8,1,4,11 May 2008
Elysium," Battle of Two Societies!
","People seem to dismiss Elysium due to the obvious political overtones in the movie, but really the film pushes across the issue that has been plaguing the world from day one: the struggles between the rich and the poor. If we look at the histories of every country and even compare to modern times, this film takes a look at a very relevant issue. Now as a film itself, it's pretty entertaining. The story may be lacking, but there is plenty of action to be had. It is a plus that the visuals are excellent. I loved the looks of the futuristic Los Angeles, as well as the space station outside Earth. The film had a very District 9 look to it at times.Neill Blomkamp's follow-up to his successful debut, District 9 takes place in the future. Earth is an over-populated wasteland where people live in poverty while the luxurious reside in a man-made space station. The people of Earth dream about traveling to the space station, but it's nearly impossible due to tough anti-immigration laws. Now an ordinary man named Max is pushed into the battle so that equality can persevere.The acting is really good. The film makes good use of Matt Damon's talent and it shows why Damon is one of Hollywood's best. Jodie Foster doesn't have much screen-time as one could hope, but she is an effective presence. Sharlto Copley as one of the bounty hunters plays evil so well, a complete opposite of his role in District 9. In Elysium, his character showed no mercy, not even to little girls suffering from leukemia.Overall, Elysium is a interesting film to watch due to its political themes on such topics such as illegal immigration, measures of equality, an unfair justice system, and so on. For a summer film, it's really smart and we need more films like this. A better screenplay and the film would have been near perfect. But this sci-fi film is action-packed and fun to watch. While it does not reach the heights of District 9, Elysium is not a bad second feature for Blomkamp. I rate this film 8/10.",8,1,1,17 November 2014
Once Upon a Time in America," Incredible!
","Once Upon a Time in America is another one of those classic gangster movies that came out often in the 70's, 80's, and 90's. Despite the four-hour running length, I was able to watch this movie with relatively high interest for the duration of the film.This story is about the lives of Jewish gangsters from the 1920's to their reunion in the 1960's.The acting has it good and bad moments. Robert De Niro and James Woods are the highlights of the film. They just carried this epic film. I really did not like Elizabeth McGovern all too much. Her character was to bland for my taste. I also wished Joe Pesci had a few more scenes to play with.This is beautifully shot and the score is just amazing. I'm astounded that the Academy did not recognize this film. But then the version released in theaters was a weak, 2 hour long film.Overall, this is one great film. There were a few slow moments with some bad acting. But I forgive this movie for that. I rate this movie 9/10.",9,0,2,17 December 2011
Taken," Amazing!
","Taken is a very good action movie but not one to be taken so seriously. This is all for the fun and to see Liam Neeson kick some serious butt. I went into this film not expecting anything too spectacular. I was blown away within the first five minutes of the film.This movie reminds me of James Bond and Jason Bourne. But here the action guy is much older and his mission is to go to Paris to find his kidnapped daughter within a few days before she succumbs to prostitution.The acting is very good. The only well known actor here is Liam Neeson and he was perfect. The supporting cast led by Maggie Grace is not that bad either.Overall, this is the perfect action movie. I had a fun time watching this. I can't wait to see the second one. I rate this film 10/10.",10,1,2,22 January 2011
Alice in Wonderland," Tim Burton Shines Again!
","Tim Burton keeps on making great movie after great movie. He never stops at doing that. Every Burton movie I've ever seen are very darn good close to perfection. His trademark of great visuals are evident in this movie. The land of Alice is just breathtaking. I really loved the final battle scene during the end where the battle takes place on a checkerboard.Alice is about to marry some dude she doesn't care for. She escapes from that moment and falls down a hole. She ends up in a mystical land where everyone believes that she's the one to slay the Jabberwocky, an evil dragon-like character. But, she believe she's the wrong Alice.The acting is great. This is the first Disney movie I have seen with a female as the main character. She certainly shined. My only complaint had to be with Johnny Depp and the Mad Hatter. I had to watch this movie twice to finally understand the role of the Mad Hatter. Of course, Helena Bonham Carter is fantastic as the Red Queen.Overall, this is a great fantasy movie. I recommend this to all people especially fans of the original Alice works and Johnny Depp. I rate this film 9/10.",9,3,4,18 June 2010
The Mummy Returns," The Mummy Returns.....Better Than Ever!
","The Mummy Returns is a very good sequel, much better than the first film. Most of the main characters return and some intriguing new characters appear for the first time. The special effects are better than the first film, obviously. There is another good blend of genres such as action, adventure, and comedy.Brendan Fraser returns as Rick O'Connell. He and his wife Evy along with their son, Alex find the bracelet of Anubis while a British Museum curator and Imhotep's old lover resurrects the powerful Imhotep. Alex gets kidnapped by Imhotep because he wears the bracelet and that is the guide to the Scorpion King. Now the O'Connells with Ardeth Bay have to rescue Alex and prevent Imhotep from taking control over the Scorpion King's army.The acting is great. Fraser did a better job than he did in the first film. Rachel Weisz is even more beautiful in this film and she is a fine actress. John Hannah cracked me up even more as the stupid uncle. The presence of a kid, Freddie Boath added youth to this film. I was happy to see that Oded Fehr got more screen time as the serious, bold protector of Imhotep's tomb.The special effects are much more effective especially when the water demon was chasing the O'Connells in the hot air balloon. The creatures by the Scorpion King's pyramid scared the living daylights out of me. I don't want to be chased by vicious creatures like those.Overall, this is a very good film. I rate this movie 10/10.",10,2,4,10 January 2009
Avatar," Absolutely Stunning!
","This has to be the best movie ever made! I made sure to get tickets for the 3D version on the very first day the movie came out. My friends and I were first in line at the cinema. Also, I got this on DVD the day it came out. James Cameron is a very good director and the master of breakthrough cinema.This is basically about a conflict between humans and a population on a different planet named the Na'vi. The humans want a special mineral named 'Unobtainium' but the Na'vi species live over the minerals. So the humans want to take the minerals by force. But there's a certain human named Jake Sully....The acting is very good.It's always good to see Signourey Weaver back in a James Cameron movie. I have been impressed with Sam Worthington over the past year with his roles.There are two minor weak points. First, the story is a little weak but who cares. Second, the cries of the blue Na'vi people sound very weird.Overall, this is an excellent movie. I'm glad this is the number one movie of all time. I rate this movie 10/10.",10,1,3,31 May 2010
Toy Story 2," Just Amazing!
","Toy Story 2 is another masterpiece by Pixar. I haven't seen a Pixar movie that I haven't yet enjoyed. This is also the first Pixar sequel and boy is it good. The animation and music are beautiful. The score/songs by Newman are fantastic and I'm sure the song by Sarah McLachlan will choke a few people up.This movie is about how Woody is stolen by a greedy store owner and his plans to sell him at a Japanese toy auction. However Buzz and the gang won't let that happen.The voice acting is amazing. Hanks and Allen of course were great. I can't see how Joan Cusack was annoying though.I loved all the new characters introduced especially Jesse the cowgirl. In fact her scene where she gets left behind from her owner is tear-jerking and my favorite.Overall, this is one of the best animated features ever. I rate this film 10/10.",10,0,1,4 February 2011
The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 2," A Good Finale to a Ho-Hum Series!
","Twilight Breaking Dawn Part 2 is a good finish as one could expect for a series like this. Looking back, these films weren't bad but as a fantasy series, they could have been much better. Unlike Part 1, most of the icky romance scenes are gone and is replaced with tension and action. Many of the scenes just feature build-up moments as we meet people from each vampire clan but all of this successfully adds up to an incredible end sequence which is worth alone the price of admission.Bill Condon's film takes place right after Bella gave birth to Renessemee. Bella is trying to get under control over her new vampire skills and trying to keep away from Charlie. But things begin to slide when the Volturi, led by Aro believes her child is an Immortal, one that can spell doom for them.As for acting, it's not magnificent, but not terrible either. I believe Kristen Stewart is better here even though she still needs to be happier. Robert Pattinson is also decent. Taylor Lautner is meh and should stay away from acting. However, Michael Sheen delivers a heck of a performance as Aro and his screen presence is amazing.Overall, the finale of the Twilight series is a good one and one that neatly brings the franchise to a close, perhaps mercifully. As always, this film features great cinematography and a good score with some easy-listening songs attached. The final forty minutes of the film is excellent and on the whole, not a bad film. I don't think this will sway any non-believers though. I rate this film 8/10.",8,2,12,16 April 2014
Invictus," Inspirational!
",This is a really fantastic film made right by the amazing Clint Eastwood and the amazing Morgan Freeman. They both add a classic to their already legendary film careers. Matt Damon deserves some kudos for this movie too. This movie is very inspirational. This movie should inspire other people to be like Nelson Mandela in this film.This movie takes place when Mandela is released from prison and takes office as President of South Africa. He supports the Springboks rugby team when no one else does. He tells them to win it all at the World Cup. He wants them to win so the country can unite with each other.The acting is fantastic. I wanted Morgan Freeman to win the Oscar so bad but some girl won instead. Matt Damon proves that he's a great actor.I am not a fan of rugby but I saw this film just to see Morgan Freeman and the brilliant directing of Clint Eastwood. This is an amazing film. I rate this movie 10/10.,10,2,4,25 June 2010
Mission: Impossible," I Wanted More!
","Mission:Impossible is not a bad film if you look at this movie as a whole. If you break it down into pieces, negative things about this movie will unravel. This film is based off the original television series from the 60's. Basically the main character, Ethan Hunt's team was killed and is being targeted as a suspect. He must seek help from other agents to stop him from being targeted. Most of the acting is fairly decent. Tom Cruise was annoying from time to time. Jon Voight and Ving Rhames were the best. The special effects are great, but so are other special-effects movies from the 90's such as Godzilla. I had a few problems with this film. Some of the scenes were boring and pointless. There is hardly any action, just talk. If you want action, I recommend James Bond. This is nothing like the original series, but this film is good to watch and compare anyway. Based of this review, I should have rated this movie 5/10 but I give it a 7/10 due to Rhames/Voight and the special effects.",8,9,16,21 December 2008
Super 8," A Nice Throwback to Spielberg!
","Super 8, which have been kept secretly under wraps until it's release date, shows why J.J Abrams is a master director with talent. He knows how to tell an effective story in blockbuster format and has a good use for special effects. In this particular story, I loved how he used tension and how he kept the audience guessing on what kind of monster we will be seeing. This reminded me of 2008's Cloverfield which was set up almost the same way.This film is about a group of kids who are filming a movie on location near railroad tracks. They happen to witness a disastrous train wreck which leads to the involvement of the Army. Now this Ohio town and residents will begin to see strange things happening. What could this be? The cast is not well-known but they all do a great job. Elle Fanning, the younger sister of Dakota, really brought herself to the eyes of the public. Kyle Chandler is also good as the town's cop who wants answers.Overall, this is a well-made throwback or homage to the early Spielberg classics. I got a sense of E.T, Close Encounters, and the Goonies while watching this film. This film has some good action, a very realistic train crash scene, and surprisingly some comedy. Despite all that, I was slightly let down. I was expecting this film to be a 10/10 film based on what everyone has been telling me. I don't think it's that good but it's just a good summer blockbuster. I rate this film 8/10.",8,0,1,18 February 2013
The Last Samurai," Oscar-Worthy!
","The Last Samurai is one the best movies from 2003. This movie is filled with depth and your imagination will run away with this excellent film. The story is about a American Civil War hero who travels to Japan to fight a samurai and train the Japanese army. But, Algren gets captured by the samurai and he trains Algren the ways of the Samurai. Now the Emperor's army and the samurais must battle. Whose side is Algren on? Tom Cruise did just about everything right. But Ken Watanabe deserves an Oscar. He was ripped at the Academy Awards several years ago. The scenery is beautiful as the movie was filmed in Japan and New Zealand. The action scenes are perfect and all the guts and gore are shown unlike Kingdom of Heaven. Rounding up this Oscar-worthy movie is the beautiful music by Hans Zimmer. This movie is underrated. I rate this movie 10/10.",10,1,3,3 November 2008
Home Alone 2: Lost in New York," I liked this movie!
","Home Alone 2 is pretty good, but I liked the first one better. Even though this is a great film, the originality is lost. This time around, Kevin gets left behind at the airport while the rest of the family travels to Florida. Meanwhile, Kevin gets on the wrong flight and heads to New York. While in New York City, Kevin learns that the two bandits from the first film escaped from prison and are planning to rob a toy store. Now, Kevin has to foil their plans while he is dealing with management from the hotel he's at. The formula is basically the same as the first film. There is nothing new, but I liked it anyway. Macualay Culkin is great once again as Kevin. Daniel Stern and Joe Pesci are funny as the bandits. Even Tim Curry and Brenda Fricker are decent in their roles. The music is something good to listen to with all the great Christmas songs. Overall, this is a great Christmas family film. I rate this movie 9/10.",9,1,3,19 October 2008
Up," Pixar At It's Very Best!
","Up is yet again another Pixar gem. From the start of Pixar all the way to the present, Pixar never disappoints. They keep producing quality film after quality film. I think Pixar may be the best Pixar film to date, even better than the Toy Story trilogy, which I never though that would happen. This movie has the characteristics of a great Pixar film. This film is a heartwarming movie with emotional moments just to sum it up in a sentence.Up is a story about an old man who meets an 8-year old explorer scout and unexpectedly, they travel together on an adventure of a lifetime.I never thought an adventure movie with an old man as a protagonist would work in its favor, but it did here. Edward Asner gave a certain charm to the voice of Carl Fredrickson.Overall, this is just a lovely Pixar film. It is one of the best films of 2009. The animation is just beautiful and great to look at. The story is quite original and the screenplay is well-written. I rate this film 10/10.",10,0,2,10 November 2012
The Hurricane," A Story of Innocence!
","The Hurricane is an inspirational story about a guy who was wrongfully imprisoned and how he does all he can to set himself free. This is a moving story and the direction by Norman Jewison is very solid. Also, Denzel Washington gives a magnificent performance as he always do. What adds significance to this story is that it is based on a true story. It may not be historically accurate as we would like, but it's still true enough to the source material that we actually believe the events that happened in the movie.Norman Jewison's film is about a guy named Rubin 'Hurricane' Carter who has dealt with the law since before he was a teenager. After he was wrongfully accused of a triple murder and was sent to life in prison, he receives the help three Canadian activists who works their very hardest to set this man free.As I mentioned before, Denzel is one of the greatest actors of my generation and possibly the entire history of cinema. He gives a gritty performance and really takes the part of the role very well. The other actors are very well in particular Liev Schreiber, John Hannah, and Dan Hedaya.Overall, this is a powerhouse film about a guy who is imprisoned because of racial hatred. The acting carries the film especially Denzel. I don't think anyone other than Denzel would be really effective in this role. I rate this film 9/10.",9,1,4,6 July 2013
A Clockwork Orange," Kubrick's Best Movie!
","A Clockwork Orange set the world on fire when it was released back in 1972 because of the controversial violence. Forty-one years later, this movie is still one of the most violent movies I have ever seen. Despite that, this is also Kubrick's best movie and he is the guy who directed Barry Lyndon, The Shining, and Full Metal Jacket. This film is also delightfully weird. The main character, Alex and his pals speak in some kind of weird English that is amusing to listen to.Kubrick's film is set in the future and is about a guy named Alex. He is a nasty hoodlum who has no problem in being a very violent, sadistic rapist. But when he gets sent to prison, he joins a program where he can be cured of any violent thoughts.Malcolm McDowell did a really good job portraying Alex. For the first half of the film, I have come to despise Alex for the person he was. But the last half of the film, I couldn't help but feel sorry for him and the misery he goes through.Overall, this is Kubrick at his very best. He paints a bleak picture on human society in the future and his messages about mankind are very thorough. In today's age, I'm surprised this movie held up the way it has because of how the taste of moviegoers changed. This may not have any explosions, but this is a compelling film about the good and bad sides of human nature. Be warned: This film contains many graphic images and intolerable crimes. But, this is an excellent movie. I rate this film 10/10.",10,0,2,13 June 2013
Where Eagles Dare," Very Entertaining Old-Time Thriller!
","Where Eagles Dare is one of the many films that were released during the plethora of World War Two films in the 1960's, and this happens to be mightily entertaining. It's an action-packed thriller that has a high-profile cast and despite the pretty long length, hard to stop watching. Sure some scenes were overlong, but I can guarantee with all the action here, this film is far from a bore.Brian G. Hutton's film takes place in a Nazi castle in the mountains of Austria. Some Allied agents land by the castle so they can rescue a captured American general, but there is more than what meets the eye when it comes to this mission.There are several brand-name actors here and who would have thought we would see Richard Burton and Clint Eastwood star opposite each other. But alas, they do here and both do a fine job. They have great chemistry with each other and they're just fun to watch. It's always nice to see Eastwood in his younger, esteemed film roles.Overall, this is a spectacular, action-packed World War Two thriller. It's best to suspend rationalism for this film like most others, because this film is only what I would like to call a 'fantasy war film.' There are elements of reality here, but not enough to justify the term realistic. But hey, this film is very entertaining and I was satisfied with the action. I rate this film 9/10.",9,1,4,1 February 2014
Groundhog Day," The Defining Film of Bill Murray's Career!
","As a movie buff, I cannot believe that I have not seen Groundhog Day until now and I wonder what put me off from seeing this movie for so long, especially as a big Bill Murray fan. This film uses his comedic talent to a long extent, but also this is a showcase for his dramatic talent too. This film has a rather interesting concept in reliving a day every day for what seems to be forever. This film is somewhat predictable, but it has a sweet, undeniable message about love and life.Harold Ramis, who also co-wrote this film, directs a film about a grumpy TV anchor named Phil Connors who has to go to Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania to cover the events along with his lovely producer and his wise-cracking camera-man. But after a big blizzard strikes the area, Phil is stuck in a time loop and he must relive the day over and over and over again.This is one of the best films of Bill Murray's career. He was excellent in such films like Ghostbusters and Lost in Translation, but his role here is even better. Even though he is like Scrooge in the film, he still managed to be hilarious. He gave his character an edge where we can like him despite his rudeness. Andie Macdowell also does a really good job as Rita, Phil's producer.Overall, Groundhog Day is a magical film that has an original sci-fi concept, but manages to effectively work comedy and romance to that concept. While it seems complicated, it's actually a simple story. We just have to thank the screenplay that Harold Ramis co-wrote for that. I don't normally give perfect scores to comedies so that proves how great this film really is. A magical, funny adventure about love. I rate this film 10/10.",10,1,2,29 September 2014
National Treasure," Great Movie!
","National Treasure is a really good movie. I have nothing but positive things to say about it. What's good is the acting, plot, screenplay, action, weaving in comedy, music, and family entertainment. This is one of those Disney movies where you think that Disney did not distribute this.Ben Gates is on a quest. He wants to find fabled treasure that most people think is fake. His associate just tried to kill him and another associate, Riley. Now, the associate, Ian wants to steal the Declaration of Independence to find the treasure. Ben ends up stealing it so it does not fall in the hands of Ian. Now he and Riley are joined up with a beautiful curator and Gate's father and they have the FBI and Ian coming after them.The acting is very good. Nicholas Cage has been a decent actor throughout his career. Jon Voight did a good job. I also was impressed with Diane Kruger and Justin Bartha.This movie is great for history buffs. The movie takes place in cities of history such as Philadelphia, NYC, and the nation's capital.I liked the music here. It is pleasant enough to listen to. The score was composed by Trevor Rabin.Overall, this is a great movie. I do not know why people are thrashing this movie. I rate this film 10/10.",10,1,4,22 January 2009
Reservoir Dogs," Pretty Good!
","Reservoir Dogs is a pretty good film, the first one made by Quentin Taratino. I like most of Taratino works but this could be my least favorite. It's a masterful film in a way, but some scenes I found too boring. Some of these talking scenes stretched on forever. But the dialogue is most of these scenes are impressive.This is about a group of guys who find out there is a rat in their group and that rat told the cops all about their crime.The acting is pretty solid. Most of the cast are B-actors but Steve Buscemi always cheers me up with his witty dialogue in basically all the films he's in. Harvey Keitel and Tim Roth are pretty good too.Overall, this is a pretty good crime film and a decent jumpstart to Taratino's career. Now I have to check out Pulp Fiction. I rate this film 8/10.",8,0,0,3 November 2010
How to Train Your Dragon," Beautiful Animation!
","How to Train Your Dragon is one of the best animated movies I have ever seen, up there with the three toy story movies. When they mentioned they were making this movie a few years back, I thought that this would suck. But by all means, this is lightyears away from that.This is about a a young Viking who befriends an injured dragon that he shot in battle. But as he trains his dragon, he keeps it a secret because he thinks his Viking colony will not approve.This is a great voice cast. I recently heard the same director and voice cast are on board for the well-deserved sequel. That bodes a good sign.The animation is beautiful. Over the past decade or so, animation has gotten so much better. It's unbelievable. I wish I saw this in 3D, but i did not. Overall, this is one of the best family/animation movies I have ever seen. I rate this film 10/10.",10,2,4,15 October 2010
Total Recall," Better Than Expected!
","Total Recall is a much better film that I expected it to be. Being a sci-fi fan and with a remake due out later this year, I decided to finally check out this film. The one thing I noticed right away is that this film had very good special effects for the the year it was released which was 1990. I read that this is one of the first major Hollywood films to use CGI.This movie is designed to make you think due to the complexity. It's a movie all about these versions of reality. The plot is way to complex to describe in detail.The acting is solid. Arnold gives a strong performance based on the fact he brought emotion into his character. Sharon Stone delivers her top performance ever, right next to her role in Casino.Overall, this is a great, complex sci-fi film. It's like the Inception of the 1990's. Not only there are plot twists, there is explosive action and very good special effects which I believed were honored at the 1991 Academy Awards. I rate this film 9/10.",9,2,6,7 May 2012
Limitless," Smarter than Expected!
","Limitless is actually a very smart thriller with an unusual plot and an interesting premise. For the most part, the filmmakers actually made good use of the unusual plot and made a good, interesting film out of it. I liked the fact that this film was not filmed in the traditional sense. What I mean by that is this film had various camera angles not usually seen in movies and a tight narration that is hard to come upon.This film is about a author who is in a downturn but when he discovers a drug that unlocks full use of the brain, his life immediately starts to get better. But after he meets a big, power-wielding broker, it seems there may be consequences after all....This film is not known for it's cast. In fact, the only brand name stars are Bradley Cooper and Robert De Niro. Cooper, starting to play in more dramatic roles, is really convincing here. De Niro actually had one of his better roles in the past decade. He brought back a shade of his pre-2000 form.Overall, this is a conceptual film that actually works and actually made money at the box office. I guess audiences were looking for a smart,original film. Well, they definitely got one here. This film features drama and thrilling moments here. There is even a few action scenes which may satisfy some people. I rate this film 8/10.",8,2,2,30 January 2013
Rocky," Very Good Sports Drama!
","This has to be one of the better movies of the 1970's. I am not a big fan of movies from that decade unless it's Jaws, Close Encounters, Star Wars, Alien, The Godfather, Grease, now this. This is truly defined as an American classic. This movie also got the great action junkie Sylvester Stallone from a name nobody heard off to a Grade A actor.This is about a poor, average boxer who is told that a heavyweight champion wants to fight him. So Rocky trains very hard in order to get ready for the heavyweight match.The acting is very good. Sylvester is an underrated actor and he's been going for years including with the Expendables that came out this year.This is a true American classic that's not all about boxing. There are a few themes here. And the score by Bill Conti is a memorable one. I rate this movie 9/10.",9,0,0,17 October 2010
Inside Man," Not Too Bad!
","Inside Man is a capable thriller/drama that works well. It's better than I thought. The only problem is that some scenes are really dull and that you just don't care about them. Denzel Washington is a great actor no matter what movie he's in. Clive Owen and Christopher Plummer steals the show here. I thought Jodie Foster does not need to be in this movie even though she's a good force.This movie is about a bank robbery at the Manhattan Trust. The robbers are looking for something very important. Will they get it or will they not? I think Spike Lee is an adept director despite what everyone else says. I really enjoyed Miracle at St. Anna.Overall, this is a good crime thriller. I was bored for some time but I still enjoyed myself. I rate this film 8/10.",8,1,3,30 September 2010
Pulp Fiction," Unbelievable!
","Pulp Fiction is one of the best movies of the 90's. I heard many excellent things about this movie but for some reasons I never got around to see it. But I have recently and I was impressed. This could even be better than Shawshank Redemption.This movie has 3 stories with all the characters interrelated with each other. We have a boxer who was supposed to lose a fight but didn't, a wife and husband who are intent of robbing a restaurant, and two low-life hit men who are ordered to bring back a stolen suitcase.This movie is filled with A-list actors. This movie resurrects the career of John Travolta. Samuel L. Jackson is just an amazing actor. I loved his quote of the bible. I also like Bruce Willis. He's the man when it comes to action.Quentin Taratino directed a visionary masterpiece. This is one for the history books. I rate this film 9/10.",9,0,2,17 July 2011
Jack Reacher," Very Good Action Film!
","Jack Reacher is an modern, above-average action thriller that is really gripping and intense. Based off an enormously popular series, I feel like the film gave the series justice. It has plenty of action throughout the film, but this film sets up the action nicely with some characterization which gives us reason why we should side with Jack Reacher. Regarding the action scenes, there are some moves here that I have rarely seen in other action films so that adds some bonus points.Christopher McQuarrie directed a film about a former army police officer named Jack Reacher who stays hidden unless he wants to be found. When one of his army fellows is convicted of random murders and calls out Reacher, Reacher realizes the guy may be innocent and now he's out to clear both of their names.On the contrary to what people are saying, this film has a great cast. People are hating on Tom Cruise because he's a short guy, unlike the Reacher in the novels. But they both have wit and determination in common and that is the main thing. Cruise is a perfect choice for this role. Werner Herzog, known as a director of many documentaries, really does his baddie role quite well. Robert Duvall has several wonderful scenes here and he still retains his sharp wit at his older age.Overall, Jack Reacher is a great action thriller. It may even make you think for a little bit, since this film is smart. It's one of the better action films of 2012 and not only it kicks lots of butt, but it's very suspenseful. I would welcome more of these Reacher films with open arms. I rate this film 9/10.",9,3,5,14 May 2014
"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"," Guy Ritchie At His Best!
","Guy Ritchie's first film, Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels is a very good debut feature and one that will put Ritchie on the radar. This film is a well crafted British comedy caper and it's very memorable thanks to very interesting characters, a well-written and witty screenplay, and a story that will keep you hooked. I liked how this film was able to blend comedy and violence much to my delight.Ritchie's film is about a self-confident guy who goes into a card game against a powerful crime lord and loses. Now in debt and fearing for his life, Eddy and his three friends decide to rob a small-time gang next door in order to pay off their debts.This film has some really good acting. This film introduced Jason Statham and Vinnie Jones to worldwide audiences and they do a very good job. I wish Statham dabbled in more comedy later in his career because he can be funny, as this film proves. The other actors in Jason Flemyng, Dexter Fletcher, and Nick Moran all do well. Every actor seems to be having a fun time and they have good chemistry with each other.Overall, this is an entertaining British comedy and is one hell of a film debut. Guy Ritchie is very talented and it's evident in the direction of this film. He also knows how to make a screenplay for sure. This and Snatch are the two films that will define his career. I wish there were more films like this. It may be a little complex, but still entertaining. I rate this film 9/10.",9,0,1,28 February 2014
Les Misérables," Will Be Sure To Make You Cry!
","The 2012 version of Les Miserables is a dark, rather depressing take on Victor Hugo's classic, but that doesn't mean it's bad. It's full of immense talent and the majority of these actors surprised me because they actually know how to sing. This film will make even the toughest cry just a little, because this is such an emotional story. This is a near-classic that surpasses the last adaptation of Les Miserables in every way.Tom Hooper directs a musical based on the events that took place during the French Revolution of 1848. This is a battle between good vs. the law and more specifically Jean Valijean vs. Javert. Valijean, who served 19 years for stealing bread and skipped parole, is on the run from Javert who believes nothing upholds the law.The acting is utterly fantastic in this film. This movie couldn't have been made with lesser acting. Anne Hathaway is fantastic and really gives me the chills during her rendition, 'I Dreamed a Dream.' Hugh Jackman was just as good as Valijean and he moved me with his performance. Russell Crowe was surprisingly good and I was impressed at his singing voice. We also got some great performances out of Amanda Seyfried, Sacha Baren Cohen, and Helena Bonham Carter.Overall, this is a great, well-done musical version of this classic novel. The production values are top-notch and the songs are wonderfully sung. The original song, 'Suddenly' was a welcome addition to the film. Don't be ashamed if this makes you cry by the end, because it definitely will. I rate this film 9/10.",9,1,1,17 May 2014
The Da Vinci Code," Code has many Thrills!
","Since this movie was received with negative reviews by critics, I saw this film with so-so expectations. I had only read the book once before this film came out. I must say that people who loved the book will not be disappointed. Tom Hanks, Ian McKellan, and Audrey Tatou were just simply amazing. This is one of Hank's best films ever made. I also give credit to the screenwriters and the director, Ron Howard. Hanks plays Robert Langdon and basically he has to solve a code written just before this guy dies while evading the French police. As I said before, this film is like the book and probably only few more movies will ever get this close to being exactly like the book. I also liked the score. It was pretty good. I rate this film a 10/10.",10,3,6,25 December 2007
Titanic," Mind Blowing!
","James Cameron is one of the best directors of all time. I have never seen him make a bad movie. This and his most recent Avatar are in the top ten of my favorite all time films. I know when a movie is very good is when I choke up. I did that for several scenes in this three-hour epic. The wonderful score by James Horner initiated some of those teardrops.This is about the fateful night in mid-April of 1912 when the luxury liner Titanic sank. Also, there is a romance story between a guy from the lower class and a girl from the upper class.The acting is pretty great. Yes there were some cheesy lines but so what. The brilliant performances of Kate and Leo make up for it.I can't see why people blast this movie with their criticisms. Maybe it was successful and it made tons of money.Overall, this is one of the best movie of all times. There's a reason why it won eleven Academy awards. I rate this film 10/10.",10,6,12,2 February 2011
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," A Magical Movie Moment!
","Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is what a book adaptation should be. The only things left out of the movie were very minor. This tells the story of a boy whose parents were killed when he was young and been mistreated by his aunt and uncle. He receives a letter about a school named Hogwarts. There, in his first year with his friends Ron and Hermione, he must stop wrongdoing of a couple teachers. The cast was wonderfully casted. Daniel Radcliffe is fantastic and looks the part of Harry. Everyone else is perfect. As I mentioned above, the adaptation is great. The movie even used the same quotations as the books. The music is memorable. I liked John William's Hedwig Theme. The costumes are good-looking and so is everything else. This movie will leave a magical imprint on your minds and this is only the first film. I rate this magical adventure 10/10.",10,4,8,22 June 2008
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," The Best Potter of the First Four!
","Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is the best Harry Potter film of the first four. The tone is darker, the acting is better, and so much more. There is only a small minimal problem that is no surprise. This time around, Harry enters his fourth year at Hogwarts. His name got entered into the Triwizard Tournament and he must compete. Little did he know that the tournament will lead to eventual trouble with a wizard who been gone for thirteen years. The acting is better in this film. Radcliffe is more appealing as Harry. Watson overacts a bit too much, but she did OK. The supporting actors like Gambon and Rickman are fantastic. I also liked the music in this film. It has a nice sound to it. The only problem is that some subplots were left out. I wished to see the Dursley's, Dobby and Winky, Charlie and Bill, the visits to Hogsmeade and Sirius, and the midnight argument with Moddy and Snape. Other than that, this film is sooooo much better than any of the other films. If I could, I would rate this film a 15/10, but I rate it a 10/10.",10,1,2,2 July 2008
Thor," Another Marvel Delight!
","In the road leading up to the Avengers, Marvel continues to release above-average superhero films and ones with mighty hearts. Thor continues that trend because it's a really good movie. There are great visuals, great characters to relate to, and just a good time.Kenneth Branagh's film is about a God of Thunder, Thor who is cast away from Asgard with no powers because of his arrogance. He meets Jane and her scientist friends and teams up with them so he can find his way back home. But there is a certain Loki who just might try to stop that...Chris Hemsworth plays a really good Thor in his first leading role in film. He plays the arrogant part very well. Loki is not the meanest villain out there but he is still effective as the villain trying to look innocent in the eyes of his people. This movie has such an impressive cast for the kind of film it is.Overall, this is another good superhero film that has good action and very good visual effects/production design. Now, I do not like to call critics out especially Roger Ebert since he is my favorite. But, I have no idea why he was so outspoken against this film. I thought this is a very good film that has me really excited for the sequel and the Avengers. I rate this film 9/10.",9,1,2,5 February 2013
The Happening," Creepy and Chilling!
","I bet this review is going to receive plenty of backlash, but I happened to be one of those people who enjoyed the Happening in some capacity. While there were some flaws to be had, I was kept on edge for the entire film and I was given the creeps more often than not. The premise is also scary enough as this film is more of an environmental thriller that poses the question, 'What would happen if trees and plants decide to protect themselves after years of global warming?' M.Night Shymalan's film is about this invisible toxin produced by the trees and those who come into contact with it commits suicide. A science teacher named Elliot and his wife, Alma must stay ahead of the wind in order to stay alive and figure out why this is happening.Now the weakest part of the film may have to do with the acting. Like many others, I agree that Mark Wahlberg was pretty bad thanks to his forced overacting. He is generally a great actor, but this performance was laughable. However, Zooey Deschanel was a good presence as always and she did a rather solid job.Overall, The Happening may not be the greatest thriller ever made, but it was often chilling and always kept me asking what is going to happen next. The screenplay is decent, but some of the dialog seems clammy. But on the whole, the film does have an excellent premise. The first hour of the film was very strong, before it gives away to a weaker ending. But on the whole, I enjoyed it. I rate this film 8/10.",8,3,4,15 November 2014
The Untouchables," Great Gangster Film!
","Despite some of the reviews I have been reading, The Untouchables possibly has to be the greatest gangster film to be released since the second Godfather. This film does not have the length of a normal gangster film because it's under two hours but that's almost what is needed for this film.This is about a treasury officer, Eliot Ness who forms a team called 'The Untouchables' and their main goal is to bring Al Capone to face the law.The acting is just brilliant. People seem to hate Kevin Costner. But I believe he did a great job as Ness. I also give credit to Sean Connery. He's a wonderful actor. I just wish Robert De Niro had more screen time as Capone. He dominated the screen with every scene he was in.Overall, this is quite the gangster movie. I think it's way underrated. I rate this film a 10/10.",10,0,1,18 December 2011
The Godfather: Part III," Vastly Underrated!
","People may bash me for this, but the third and final entry into the well-respected Godfather trilogy is the second best film in the series right behind Part Two. I was really hooked into the movie for the entire running time of 170 minutes. I don't know why people hate this film, but I love it.Michael Coreleone is now in his 60's and he is trying to bring his corporation out of the gangster realm and into the world of legitimacy and respectability.The acting, as with the first two, is just amazing. Pacino should have been at least nominated by the Academy. I don't care how many people bash Sofie's performance, but I liked her. Also just to see Connie Corelone played beautifully by Talia Shire turn into the scheming sister really made my day.The cinematography and the score were just amazing. I still run the theme over and over in my head.Overall, this is an epic conclusion to one of the best trilogies of all time. There is not one bad thing to say except it may be a little long. I rate this film a 9/10.",9,3,6,19 December 2011
The Matrix Reloaded," Better Action!
","The Matrix Reloaded is a better movie than the first one simply because the movie is more action-packed. I liked the action and the sci-fi. This simply makes me wish for the third one.Basically, the gang of Neo, Morpheus, and Trinity are still at battle with machines and Agent Smith. But Neo learns more about himself and his abilities.Keanu Reeves is alright. He is known to be similar to a robot when it comes to acting. Laurence Fishburne is a really good actor.Overall, this is a good sci-fi film that is better than it's predecessor. I rate this movie 8/10.",8,0,1,1 July 2010
The Fountain," Be Prepared To Think!
","If you're going to watch The Fountain, I must caution viewers that this is one of those films that require some semblance of a brain due to the complexity of this film. People didn't like this film precisely because they did not want to think. However, I found this film fascinating because of the story that is rich in underlying themes about eternal love. This film not only boasts a well-made and rather controversial storyline, it's visually striking and features some amazing visuals to look at. Just looking at the end credits will say it all.Darren Aronofsky's film has one complicated plot that spans centuries and millennia and talks about the past, present, and future. There are story lines revolving around a guy named Tom who's looking for a cure for his dying wife, a guy named Tomas Verdes who is looking for the Tree of Life, and a space traveler who hallucinates his lost love.Hugh Jackman delivers one of his career-best performance as he plays these multiple characters. He sheds away his X-Men persona and gives a heartfelt, emotional, and raw performance. A performance we have not seen from him before. Rachel Weisz does a very good job as well.Overall, if you're able to close your eyes and use your brain, you'll more likely to find this film fantastic. I loved how this film drew parallels from the past through future while looking for the meaning of life and what one takes to be in love. There are several biblical references here and that makes the journey even more spiritual. A fantastic and a vastly underrated movie to behold. I rate this film 9/10.",9,4,6,24 February 2014
Mystic River," Amazing!
","I can't say enough about the great Clint Eastwood. This movie started a span of fantastic, Oscar-winning movies that are made by Eastwood. That span goes on still today because every one of his films since this one are very powerful movies. This is no exception. This has a truly wonderful cast, a well-written script, and great music.Back in 1975, Dave Boyle was abducted and he was sexually abused for several days. Now years later, he is still haunted by that. One of Boyle's friend Jimmy believes that caused him to murder his daughter. Did he do it or not? The acting is outstanding. Sean Penn, Tim Robbins, and Kevin Bacon are one of the better actors from the 80's to today. They really know how to act. Sean Penn as Jimmy is probably the best character he has ever played. Penn and Robbins deserved their Oscars.This should have won best picture only if it wasn't competing against the final Lord of the Rings. LOTR deserved the Oscar though. Overall, this is a powerful drama. I give kudos to everyone who participated in the movie. I rate this movie 10/10.",10,0,1,6 July 2010
Zombieland," A Wicked Good Time!
","Zombleland is a movie that is very funny and offers the audience a very entertaining movie. In fact, this is the film that kind of made zombies popular again after hardly existing for several years prior to this movies existence. Just watching this film, I had one heck of a good time watching all the jokes and gore being interwined.This film is about a group of humans joining together in a post-apocalyptic United States and trying to head to a amusement park in California by staying alive and beating up zombies.The acting is great. Jesse Eisenberg came in to his own with this film and Adventureland back in 2009. Woody Harrelson certainly cracked me up as the tough, no-nonsense kind of guy. Emma Stone and Abigail Breslin were great as the con girls. But the best part was Bill Murray. He was by far the funniest part of the movie.Overall, this is a very funny 'horror' film. It's not a horror film per se but it does feature elements of one such as the gore. This movie, of course, reminded me of the other great zombie comedy, 'Shaun of the Dead.' I rate this film 9/10.",9,0,2,19 November 2012
Enemy at the Gates," Good War Movie!
","Enemy at the Gates is a pretty good war movie though not the best in accuracy. I did not care because this movie is in a genre called historical fiction and of course changes will be made. People should stop complaining how this movie insults them or how its not accurate.This movie has a few similarities to Saving Private Ryan especially the beginning. This is about the battle of Stalingrad between the Germans and Russians. The Germans send their best sniper Konig to kill the young, star Russian sniper.The acting is very good. I always enjoy Ed Harris in whatever movie he acts in. Jude Law is surprisingly great in this movie. Rachel Weisz adds a great screen female presence.Overall, I thought this was a good movie but it has some flaws. There is plenty of gore and action here. I rate this film 8/10.",8,2,4,10 October 2010
A Beautiful Mind," A Beautiful Story!
","I saw this movie expecting this film to be worthless trash. But, I am wrong, as usual. The main character in this story is a real person named John Nash, a brilliant mathematician who is depicted by Russell Crowe. After he is involved in a conspiracy, he develops insanity and he remains that way for about 40-45 years. This film won four Oscars including Best Picture and I say that this film deserves it. The acting was incredible especially with Crowe, Bettany, Plummer, and Harris. The script was written well and that means the storyline worked well. I also liked the score by James Horner. The music got things rolling in the movie. I recommend this film for all ages. I rate this film a 9/10.",9,2,6,30 December 2007
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," Even Better than Sorcerer's Stone!
","Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is a fantastic sequel to the first one. In this film, Harry and his friends must unfoil a plot in which the plan is to petrify and possibly kill non-magic students of Hogwarts school of Witchcraft and Wizardry. The acting is pretty good. Radcliffe, Grint, and Watson are entering puberty, so their voices are different. Only Grint as Ron was a bit annoying. The supporting cast is great. It's sad that this is Richard Harris's last film. Like most films, the special effects are great. The action scenes in the Chamber of Secrets is fantastic. Quidditch in this film is even better than the first because the Slytherins have a new Seeker that will surprise most people. John William's score is just as good of a masterpiece. This film might be a bit scary for younger children. I rate this film a 10/10.",10,1,4,26 June 2008
Mr. & Mrs. Smith," Good Action Movie!
","I had my doubts about seeing this movie. But I saw this movie on sale for only three bucks and I was fortunate enough to buy it. This movie has several flaws, but I liked it better than I thought.John and Jane Smith have been married for five or six years. They live peaceful, blissful lives to each other. Away from each other, they are assassins of rival groups. Their next mission is to eliminate each other and that will cause havoc.The acting is pretty good. I enjoy watching Brad Pitt act. Angelina Jolie was even better to watch. They had pretty good chemistry. Vince Vaughn even did a good job.This movie is also filled with comedy. The Smith family had some pretty wise remarks. The special effects are good.A major flaw would be the plot. The plot/script is not all that good but everything else makes up for it.Overall, this is a good action movie made for popcorn munchers. I rate this film 8/10.",8,1,3,17 February 2009
The Departed," Deserves the Oscars!
","The Deaparted is a very good crime/drama movie. This would've gotten a 10 if it was not for one thing-it is hard to follow the plot. I was able to catch a grasp on what the story is about. It's about an undercover cop spying on the evil guy-Costello and feeding information back to his detective bosses. Meanwhile, there is a rat from Costello in the police unit. This movie is very good. There are brand name actors and they live up to all the hype. Leonardo, Jack, Mark, and Matt were amazing performing their parts. This is a great move to add on Jack Nicholson's resume. The music by Howard Shore is not what you would expect. It is not 'Lord of the Rings' music, but I still liked the music. This film is full of violence and cursing. That is what I liked about this. If don;t like that kind of stuff, don't see this movie. I rate this movie 9/10.",9,1,4,5 December 2008
Die Hard," Great Action!
","Die Hard is one of the best action movies I have ever seen. The only heroes I like better are Jason Bourne and Indiana Jones. The action is great and I think that Bruce Willis is the right person for this role.The main character John McLaine, a NYPD cop gets invited to a Christmas party by his wife in California. During the party, the hotel where the party is gets attacked by terrorists led by Hans Gruber. The people at the party is held hostage until the demands of 600 million dollars are met. But, John manages to escape and give the terrorists some trouble.I am impressed with Bruce Willis. He did a great job and he did all the stunts barefoot. Alan Rickman can play the bad guy, no matter what genre the film is. He is sinister, evil, and a guy you don't want to mess with. I also like the guy who played Sgt. Al Powell.Overall, this is a very good film. I rate this movie 9/10.",9,2,3,1 January 2009
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," Why Is This Hated So Much?
","I can't believe some of the reviews I read for this movie. People trash this movie so much because it makes an attempt at humor. I admit it wasn't the best but it still got some laughs out of me. Everything is just perfect for a summer blockbuster. Maybe that's another reason why people hate this.Sam Witwicky continues his alliance with the robots two years after the original events. As usual he and his robots are out to save the world from invasion.The acting is pretty good. Shia is a pretty good action star. Megan Fox is hot as usual. John Turturro provided some more neat comic relief.Overall, this is a great blockbuster. It also has plenty of action and great special effects. I rate this film 9/10.",9,25,46,11 February 2011
Jersey Boys," Oh What a Night!
","Jersey Boys is a film adaptation of the hit Broadway musical that showed the rise and decline of the 60's rock group, the Four Seasons. I was familiar with many of their songs, but I did not realize how hard it was to keep the group together. On the outside, this film is a by-the-books biography of the group. But if you look deeper, there is a deep thread of characterization with each main character, and that is quite lovely to see. On the whole, the film was very enjoyable thanks to the production design and toe-tapping musical numbers. Clint Eastwood's film is about the rise and fall of the New Jersey-bred men who joined together to form a musical group based around Frankie Valli's uncommon voice. We see the troubles that arise and the hits that come before they become less popular as we head into the 1970's. This film does not have a recognizable cast at all outside of one name, and that is a good thing. We don't have stardom to stand in the way of actual talent. The man who played Valli, was John Lloyd Young, who actually won a Tony for his portrayal as Frankie in the Broadway show. The only star on this cast is Christopher Walken as a mob leader, and he does quite a good job as a mentor to the kids. Overall, Jersey Boys isn't the atrocious musical I was expecting it to be. It's not perfect in any sense as the story suffers from some issues. But it was an enjoyable film that taught me some about the group while singing along to their greatest hits. The film receives high marks for the production design and the costumes, which are usually top-notch in Eastwood movies anyhow. A fan of the play will certainly become a fan of the movie.

Zero Dark Thirty," Great Storytelling!
","Zero Dark Thirty is an incredible piece of art that has the gift of very good storytelling. Whatever people may say, but this is not political propaganda. Sure this is a political story, but it's not propaganda. It's thrilling, intense, and very realistic. The film is set up in two parts and the first part is nearly perfect, but the second part, while still good, is a little murky and confusing.Katheryn Bigelow, who directs her first film since the Hurt Locker, directs the film that is based off of actual events. Since 9/11, America has been on the hunt for Osama Bin Laden. After all the hard work put in by a government operative named Maya, she believes they may have found Bin Laden at long last.The acting is incredibly good. Jessica Chastain pulls of her role as Maya very well. She is reluctant when it comes to torture, but believes it is good for the common cause. Jason Clarke does a good job as Dan. I also wish there was more screen time for Joel Edgerton as he's a really good actor.Overall, Zero Dark Thirty is an intense film that is made to entertain, to thrill. It has no political agenda on it's mind. This film is an big improvement on the Hurt Locker, which I'm relieved. This film has some incredible technical work at play such as the sound effects and such. Overall, a very good film thanks to the apt direction of Bigelow and a gifted actress in Chastain who uses her talent very well. I rate this film 9/10.",9,0,1,10 May 2014
Crazy Heart," Jeff Bridge's Show!
","There is no denying that Crazy Heart is an excellent movie. It's a slow- moving drama about a country singer trying to find humanity in life and receives uplifting help in an unusual way. This film is like the first cousin of 1983's Tender Mercies ironically enough also starring the excellent Robert Duvall. I really liked the music in the film. The original songs are fantastic and as I am not a big fan of country music, that is some high praise. Scott Cooper's film is about a washed-up country singer named Bad Blake who is an alcoholic and a man who seen too many marriages. On his road to salvation, Blake takes the route of love. He finds an aspiring journalist named Jean and with her, he just may be able to turn his life around. This is the film that finally got Jeff Bridges his Oscar win. He deserved it with this role. Of course this role may draw comparison to Duvall in Tender Mercies, but Bridges put his unique spin on the movie. He has one heck of a voice. I can also say that about Colin Farrell. He is the last actor I thought would appear in a movie about country music, but he does have the vocal talent. Maggie Gyllenhaal delivers another strong performance as Bridge's female counterpart. Finally, Duvall had an effective appearance, or I shall more accurately say cameo. Overall, Crazy Heart is an excellent film. It's a film about a man trying to lead the life to redemption. It's about the choices you make, the paths you are willing to take. This is a great, subtle drama and it shows Scott Cooper may have a knack for directing. The music is heaven on the ears and the original songs are some of the best written for film in years. Jeff Bridges is the key of the success of this film. I rate this film 9/10.",9,1,1,28 January 2015
War of the Worlds," A Fun Summer Blockbuster!
","Now even though this is Steven Spielberg at the directors helm, this is what a summer blockbuster should be. I find that people bash this movie because they expect an awards season movie as Spielberg typically makes year in and year out.This is based off H.G Wells radio broadcast and novel. It's about aliens that rise from the ground to destroy Earth.The acting is pretty good. I am a really big fan of Tom Cruise so I enjoyed another performance of his. I thought Justin Chatwin who played Robbie was annoying though. I also recognize the talents of Dakota Fanning and Tim Robbins.Overall, this is a fun movie to watch. It can be a little scary at times. Also, the special effects are amazing especially the tripods. This isn't Indiana Jones or E.T, but I rate this film 9/10.",9,1,2,1 February 2012
12 Years a Slave," A Brutal Look at the Horrors of Slavery!
","12 Years a Slave is one of those films that will leave you shocked and teary-eyed. It's the sort of film that will have you talking about it for days. The film may be Oscar-bait, but that doesn't stop the film from being a powerful, unflinching take on the brutality of slavery in the Antebellum Period. The film is very hard to watch and some scenes, especially the violent whipping scenes, I had to turn away. But the film tells the dark side to American history in such a cold, unforgiving manner. That makes the film even more powerful and emotional as we view the exploits of the main character, Solomon Northup.Steve McQueen's film chronologizes the twelve years that Solomon Northup, a free man from New York, spent in slavery. Northup is guided to Washington D.C under false pretenses and is wrongfully kidnapped and is forced to spend the next twelve years amongst many plantations and abusive overseers. This is the story of one man who tries to fight slavery while being forced to work as a slave.The film has a great cast and while many of the actors don't have large parts, they are effective parts. Chiwetel Ejiofer finally has the chance to shine as a leading man and in turn, he delivers the best performance of his career. Other defining performances are Michael Fassbender as the malicious plantation owner, Paul Dano as an abusive overseer, and Lupita N'yongo as Fassbender's slave love interest. She is hardly in the film, but her last scenes are incredible and quite frankly, tortuous to watch.Overall, 12 Years a Slave is a brutal film to watch. It's hard to take about how people in this country suffered this way only a few centuries ago. Slavery is immoral and the film makes a that a big point. The film is brutal to watch because of the violent, disturbing content which features a good amount of blood. We currently live in turbulent times here in America, and this is a good film to watch as blacks are our equals and even 170 years after the events of the film, we still don't hold true to those standards. This is a fantastic film and one of the best, if not the best film of 2013. I rate this film 10/10.",10,0,2,28 December 2014
Wedding Crashers," Absolutely Hilarious!
","Wedding Crashers has to be one of the funniest movies I have ever seen. I really got into this movie from start to end. I enjoyed all parts of the movie even the sappy romance parts which most people seem to despise.This is about two guys who crashes weddings and things change for them when they crash the wedding of the daughter of the Secretary of Treasury.Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson have great chemistry. That's not surprising since they are generally both funny. I was surprised to see Walken in this but he's a versatile actor. I also commend the performances of Rachel McAdams and the crazy Isla Fisher.Overall, this is a very hilarious comedy. This is one of the most quotable comedies you will ever see. By the way, the cameo part is really sick, but dead-on hilarious. I rate this film 10/10.",10,1,2,3 February 2012
There Will Be Blood," Overrated!
","This is not a bad movie by any stretch of the imagination but the question is: is it good enough to be Oscar-nominated? My answer is no. I know many movies that should have been nominated from 2007 that weren't. Comparing this to No Country for Old Men, this movie is pretty bad. But as a stand alone, I really can't complain about this movie because it's intriguing.This is about an oil tycoon who is very greedy and is a liar as well. He uses a young boy H.W to help him push his point through. He also has to go against a preacher who opposes his work.The acting is probably the best thing about this movie. Maybe Daniel Day-Lewis deserved the nomination but not the win. Paul Dano actually impressed me as the priest.I am a big critic of movie scores. This may have to be the worst. All I heard were screeching violins and it made my ears hurt. Well it got the eerie sound correct.Overall, this is a good movie but not an Oscar-worthy movie. It's also too long for a movie subject like this. Paul Dano single-handedly gave this movie a 7/10.",7,0,2,1 February 2011
Ice Age," A Very Good Comedy!
","Ice Age is a very funny movie. This is one of the best animations ever. Even after I saw this film nearly 20 times, I still laugh hard which is not very often for a lot of comedies. This story is about a shrewd woolly mammoth, a dumb sloth, and a baby-hungry saber toothed tiger trying to return a lost baby to its tribe before a pack of tigers ambush the baby and the gang. The acting in the film is great. Ray Romano and John Leguizamo were hilarious as their parts. Denis Leary as Diego is good too. I liked the music in this film. I think the score is great and the one song by Rushed Root featured in the film. Overall, this is a suitable movie for people of all ages. I rate this film a 10/10.",10,1,2,30 July 2008
To Kill a Mockingbird," An Incredible Masterpiece!
","To Kill A Mockingbird is a film that could very well be two films. It's a drama about growing up and coming of age during an era of civil rights unrest. But that civil rights unrest also is the subject of the second 'film,' a courtroom drama featuring a black man wrongfully convicted of a crime. This is a fantastic movie and one of the best movies to come out of the 1960's. But the racial themes underlying this film is still relevant today, and perhaps people should pay more attention to Gregory Peck's speech at the end of the movie regarding racism. There have never been more truer words spoken on film. I loved every aspect of the film from the very tense drama to the excellent black-and-white cinematography to the satisfying ending to the excellent score by Elmer Bernstein.Robert Mulligan's film takes us to a Depression-era town where a poor lawyer named Atticus Finch lives with his two children, Jem and Scout. Finch is assigned to a case where this black man is convicted for the rape of a young woman. The town gets riled up about the case, and Atticus and his two kids may find themselves in danger.It's funny because a film based off a beloved novel would gain more of a well-known cast. But the only star here is Gregory Peck and he does a wonderful job as Atticus Finch. I think that speech he delivers in the end gave him that Oscar. Mary Badham does a wonderful job as the young Scout, and I am disheartened that she stopped her acting career soon after this film's release, because she gave such a magnificent performance. Also, this film is Robert Duvall's first screen role and with limited screen time, his character as Boo Radley is another memorable character this movie offers.Overall, To Kill A Mockingbird is one of the best films of the 1960's or even in the history of cinema. Not only is it an effective drama, it has racial themes that occurred during the height of the Civil Rights Movement. This is one of the films that actually put sympathy towards the movement during this time period. One of my favorite scenes involves Atticus standing guard against a mob in which Scout comes to his rescue. That was a very moving scene and one of the many memorable scenes in the film. A fantastic movie that is part of our history and one for every generation to see.My Grade: A+",10,2,4,29 August 2015
The Bridge on the River Kwai," A Flawless Piece of Cinema History!
","The Bridge on River Kwai is another example of great filmmaking from the Golden Age of Cinema. I shouldn't be surprised with the pedigree of the cast and that the director is the renowned David Lean. The film may approach three hours, but it a work of legacy and one of the greatest war films ever made. This film features underlying drama and some spectacular battle scenes towards the end. Also the ruthless treatment of the POW camp towards the British colonel was hard to watch, but it was fitting towards how the Axis powers actually treated the Allies. David Lean's film is about a British colonel named Nicholson who he and his men were captured by the Japanese. After enduring endless amounts of torture, Nicholson is able to convince the commander of the camp, Saito to allow him to help design the bridge they are tasked to building. However, the Allies hatch a plot, whom Nicholson is completely oblivious of, to destroy the bridge. If you want fine acting, you have come to the right place. Alec Guinness truly absorbs himself into the role of Nicholson and we see his acting ability fly high as Nicholson endures Japanese brutality to convince them to do what he wants. Sessue Hayakawa as Saito was indeed very good in his role as we see personal greed overcome his character. William Holden was excellent and does not hold back as the sarcastic American soldier, Shears. We also get a strong performance from Jack Hawkins as Major Warden, the man who knows his explosives. Overall, The Bridge on River Kwai is probably one of the top ten films ever made. Any young person should view this film, as this epic holds up very well. It may be historical fiction, but it does have its place in history. This is the kind of film David Lean knows how to make, just like his other films like Lawrence of Arabia. Those who watch this film for the first time will be rewarded with such rich cinema Everything about the film: the acting, directing, cinematography, score, and plot just screams perfection. One of the greatest war films ever made. My Grade: A+",10,0,2,26 February 2015
Man on Fire," Great Story!
","This is a really good movie. In fact, this is an excellent movie. I went to see this film with high expectations and I was not disappointed. Denzel Washington truly made this movie superb.This film is about a drunk ex-assassin. He gets assigned to protect an American girl living with her family in Mexico City, the worst city for kidnapping. But when he fails to protect her and she gets kidnapped, he vows to search for her until he is dead.The acting is very powerful. I enjoyed Denzel Washington's performance. He is a very good actor and he showed off his skills in this movie. I liked Dakota Fanning's character as well. She is a cute kid that everyone liked.This film is full of plot twists and turns. There are some shocking, sad, and happy moments. The music is great because it really adds more to the appropriate scenes. Overall, this is a fantastic film. I rate this film 10/10.",10,0,1,9 August 2009
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," One of the Best of the 1970's!
","One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is definitely in my top five films of the 1970's up there with the The Godfather, The Godfather Part 2, Star Wars, and Jaws. This is just a flat-out perfect film and I could not say anything to criticize about this amazing film.This movie is pretty much about some guy named McMurphy, a patient at a mental hospital, who wants to change the routine of the hospital. But Nurse Ratched will not stand for that.This and Chinatown are the films that brought Jack Nicholson into the public spotlight. He is just too darn good in this film. I also loved the performance by Louise Fletcher as Nurse Ratched. She is not the typical villain per se, but she affects her patients psychologically rather than physically. I also mention actors such as Danny DeVito, Christopher Lloyd, and Brad Dourif because they were all really good.This movie certainly deserves the Oscars it won back in 1976. Also the score, cinematography, and the rest of the film is just too good. My favorite scene is the fishing trip that I felt brought the inmates closer together. I cannot see how anyone would dislike this. I rate this film 10/10.",10,2,4,28 April 2012
Edge of Tomorrow," Edge of My Seat!
","Edge of Tomorrow is one of the most brilliant, original sci-fi films to grace the big screen in recent years. Of course, it carries an infinite load of action sequences, but this is also a character story that infuses sci-fi themes like time travel in a way. The film is essentially a louder, sci-fi version of Groundhog Day. The film is not only fun, but it is also brainy which is hard to see in a sci-fi film nowadays. The film should have been seen by more people, because it's just that good. Doug Liman's film is about a global war that is ongoing between the humans and these aliens. Major William Cage is sent into battle despite having no combat training. As the battle is just beginning, he dies. But he wakes up with day starting all over again thanks to making contact with one of the alien's blood. Along with the help of one of the world's best soldiers, Rita, Cage must relive the day over and over again until he can defeat the aliens. The film has great acting. Tom Cruise is getting older, but he still can hold an action film on his own. There are no death-defying stunts here, but I feel that Cruise once again does a really good job. He is equally matched by the gorgeous Emily Blunt. I don't associate her with action movies, but this movie may have changed my mind. I also liked Bill Paxton as one of the army leaders. He is just quite funny. Overall, Edge of Tomorrow is an excellent film that has such a well- founded, original premise. The action is heavy, but that doesn't stop the film from adding such good moments of characterization. As for popcorn summer blockbusters, it does not get any better than this. A sci-fi film that will actually make the audience think. A very good film with great visuals, good acting, and heavy on the action. My Grade: A+",10,1,4,27 April 2015
The Wolf of Wall Street," Leo and Scorcese Shines Yet Again!
","The Wolf of Wall Street is such a crazy, dynamic movie based on the true happenings of Jordan Belfort, a rich, drug-happy Wall Street investor who essentially defrauded everyone on Wall Street. Scorcese is known for taking films to another level, and he certainly does that here. The 3- hour film flies by with the drugs, booze, and more drugs as we see how corrupt Wall Street can be. This is Scorcese's craziest film to date, and that is surprising with his impressive filmography. Martin Scorcese's film is about the events that landed Jordan Belfort in prison for thirty-six months for investment fraud. Rising from the humble beginnings of a penny investor, he moves his way up the ladder using not so legal methods as he is aided from the help of drugs, women, and alcohol. Leonardo DiCaprio made have provided his best acting performance to date, which is impressive with his resume. He looked like he really had fun and he gave us one with no strings attached. The opening scene with him though is impressive with the little help of cocaine. Jonah Hill gave a fine performance as Jordan's drug-addicted, right-hand man. Matthew McConaughey had a brief, but excellent performance giving Jordan the workings of Wall Street. Finally, a star was born in Margot Robbie. She is just a goddess acting as Jordan's second wife. It helps that she is very pretty as well. Overall, The Wolf of Wall Street is another excellent film to add in the resumes of both Leonardo DiCaprio and Martin Scorcese. It also may be their most fun and craziest film to date. It's a very long film, but the length doesn't that bad because the film is stocked with so many interesting points. As a film based on Wall Street, only the 1987 film 'Wall Street' may exceed this film in quality, although the tone of both films are sharply different. This film is a fun ride and part of me wish that Leo finally won the Oscar he deserves, but maybe next time. I rate this film 9/10.",9,0,4,26 January 2015
The Last King of Scotland," Great Thriller!
","The Last King of Scotland is a very good film. It may not be totally accurate, but there are still some historical references in this film. Forest Whittaker definitely deserves an Oscar for this movie.This film takes place in Uganda and it tells the story of a Scottish doctor who becomes the personal adviser and healthcare provider of dictator Idi Amin and his family. It starts well at first but things become more serious as the years goes on. Now, the doctor, Garrigan is surrounded by betrayal and havoc. Forest Whittaker did an extremely good job portraying Amin. James McAvoy wasn't too bad either. Overall, this is a great film portraying many messages and has a little historical truth. I rate this film 9/10.",9,0,1,18 January 2009
Bram Stoker's Dracula," A Modern Classic!
","Dracula is just one of those movies that provide the opportunity to scare you no matter how many times you watch this. It's all because of the acting, costume design, and makeup. It all looks too real even though it's not.This is based of Bram Stoker's novel, Dracula. Dracula has been waiting years to find his one love. That time arrives in Victorian London. Dracula heads to London to face his love once more.Gary Oldman makes the perfect Dracula. He was the perfect choice to play the Count. Anthony Hopkins who also was magnificent must have a fling for mystical creatures since he also starred in The Wolfman.Overall, this is a great movie but it was a little slow at first. It's great for Halloween. So move over Saw and Paranormal Activity, this is the true Halloween classic. I rate this film 8/10.",8,1,3,7 November 2010
Die Hard with a Vengeance," Best One Out of the First Three!
","This Die Hard film is another great, action-packed movie in a series with tons of action and terrorists. This is the best film of the first three movies. There is more action, better actors, and the terrorist played by Jeremy Irons is a bit more twisted and evil.Bruce Willis returns as John McClane. He is drunk, suspended from NYPD, and on the verge of splitting up with his wife when a terrorist calls the NYPD asking for McClane. The terrorist, Simon Gruber tells MCClane to go to Harlem with a sign referring to hating black people. He gets joined by a black owner of a electronics shop. They and the police have to bring down the terrorists while they play games with them.This movie has the best acting. Samuel L. Jackson is one of my favorite actors and he did not disappoint as the racist owner. Jeremey Irons is the perfect villain. He gives me the creeps playing the game-loving terrorist.There is much more action than the previous film. In fact, this movie starts with a building being blown up. If you want some thrills, check out the car chase across Central Park.Great Movie! I rate this film 9/10.",9,3,4,3 January 2009
Con Air," Another Great 90's Action Film!
","Along with other greats from the late 80's and 90's such as Die Hard and Lethal Weapon, this movie joins that group of amazing movies. This is what you call a typical action movie. There are tons of explosions and really menacing bad guys.Basically, a group of prisoners decide to take over the plane they're being transported on. They want to escape for their freedom in sunshine and sand. But, one of the prisoners is on his way home due to parole. He wants to make sure that he sees his wife and daughter again. He will do anything it takes.The strongest point of the movie is the acting. The acting is full of well-known actors such as Nicolas Cage, John Cusack, and John Malkovich. Malkovicn can really play an intimidating bad guy. I wouldn't want to cross his path. Cage and Cusack were also very good.I liked the music of the film. I wonder how the song by Tricia Yearwood can be nominated for both an Oscar and a Razzie award. I liked that song. Overall, this is a great action film and a one to watch over and over again. I rate this movie 10/10.",10,0,0,13 February 2010
Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy," Not Bad!
","I'm gonna start off saying that I'm not a huge fan of Will Ferrell. He was okay in Kicking and Screaming and Step Brothers. He was actually funny in his Austin Powers cameos. Anyway, I thought Ferrell was okay here. It was the supporting cast that made this film.This is about the San Diego news anchor people and how one woman is destined to be the first woman ever to broadcast news on air but not if Ron Burgundy can help it.Now I'm gonna describe the funny stuff. Steve Carell is awesome as the dimwit idiot. The cameos(and there are plenty)provide enough laughs. The fight at the end is awesome and so is the dialogue between a dog and a bear.Overall, this is a solid movie. This may be one of Ferrell's best and that's saying something. I rate this movie 8/10.",8,1,1,25 September 2010
Ice Age: Continental Drift," Still Strong After All These Years!
","Since the first Ice Age debuted in 2002, there now have been three sequels with this film, Continental Drift being the third one. Despite the poor reviews, I enjoyed this film. I have been a fan of the series since it originally came out and while not having the magic of the first film, it still has the charms, zany characters, themes of friendship/family, good animation, and the comedy that we have come to love from Manny, Sid, and Diego.This film reunites our favorite heroes as the land they know begins to break up and create problems for everyone. Manny and the gang are separated from his wife and daughter and while trying to get back to them, they are captured by a group of pirates bent on making their lives miserable.This voice cast still boasts an impeccable voice cast led by our favorites: Ray Romano, Denis Leary, and John Leguizamo. Queen Latifah does solid voice work as well. On the other hand, Nicky Minaj was in this movie and all I can say is....ugh.Overall, Ice Age: Continental Drift is still an entertaining adventure even though I fear it may be losing some mojo. Children will definitely enjoy this and so will fans of the series. It has crisp animation, silly comedy, and also a few good songs such as that one called, 'We Are Family.' That is a perfect title for a film that relies on friendship and family bonding. I rate this film 9/10.",9,0,0,31 January 2014
American Gangster," Great Gangster Film!
","American Gangster is one of the few gangster movies I have seen. I think it might be one of the best if not the best. Another thing that makes this movie great is that there is historical accuracy, not a 100 percent but still accurate enough. This film is about a detective named Ritchie trying to capture the drug warlord Frank Lucas who is involved in many operations. He did this to support his family. An outcome involving the capture of Lucas really amazes me. Nearly three quarters of New York cops were arrested and convicted of bribery charges. Ridley Scottt did a great job directing this film. He can do any genre without making a fool out of himself. The acting is pretty good. I think Denzel Washington is a great actor. Russell Crowe actually did something right for once. The technical parts of the movie is pretty good. The movie is somewhat boring but I was kept awake because I was intrigued about the plot. I rate this movie 9/10.",9,1,3,30 November 2008
The Mission," Sweeping and Majestic!
","Roland Joffe's The Mission is a sweeping and beautiful historical epic of two men with two entirely different professions band together to save an endangered Indian species. Led by a majestic score by Ennio Morricone and sweeping cinematography and beautiful shots of the lush South American wilderness, this movie is one of the best of the 1980's. The movie has been overlooked mostly because of it's Christian themes, but as it's about saving people and a man of the cloth, it should have these themes.This film is about how a Jesuit and a slave trader unite to save a South American tribe from relocation and other dangers.The acting is really good. Jeremy Irons and Robert De Niro make a very good team thanks to great chemistry. The Indian actors are also really good as they brought a sense of realism to their lifestyle.Overall, this is a great, underrated epic that would teach some people history they did not know about. My only complaint is that the battles at the end of the film lacked effective choreography and I did not find them to be realistic. But what I did liked is how these two men did everything in their power to convince the church that these native people are worth their lives and their land. I rate this film 9/10.",9,6,7,31 March 2013
The Green Mile," Very Good Film!
","The Green Mile is one of the best films from a decade ago. Apparently, the American public thought so, too. This film is mesmerizing and thought-provoking. I was kind of reluctant to see this because the movie is over three hours long. Well, the time went faster than you would think.The story is based on the novel by Stephen King. It's about the life of prison guards that guard the Death Row inmates and the inmates especially John Coffey. Coffey brings a new spark to everyday life at the prison awaiting the electric chair.The acting is near perfect. Tom Hanks and Michael Clarke Duncan led a fantastic cast. The snotty prison guard is also good because he is annoying in a good way.This movie won a few, well-deserved Oscars. This movie should have won Best Picture. This movie will bring tears to your eyes. This is a very powerful film! I rate this movie 10/10.",10,1,2,8 March 2009
The Reader," Unforgettable Film!
","The Reader is a powerful film that delivers a gut-wrenching story and some powerful acting. This was the film that gave Kate Winslet her long overdue Oscar and boy did she ever deserve it. This film has many themes including eroticism, love, and friendship. This movie is simply not meant to be a tearjerker, but don't be surprised if you feel a tear or two.Stephen Daldry's film is set in two phases. The first phase is a tale of romance that blossoms between a 15-year-old boy and a 36-year-old woman. The next phase is a gut-wrenching court case involving the woman, Hanna as one of the defendants for taking part in some heinous crimes as a member of the SS.The acting is very, very powerful. Kate Winslet delivers a masterful performance and you can't expect more out of her. Her facial expressions and cold, stern manner truly defines the hardness of her character. Ralph Fiennes does a solid job as the older Michael Berg whilst the guy who played the younger Berg was so-so.Overall, this is a great film that will surely wrench your gut. The final hour is very hard to watch as we a submission to guilt and how it affects the love between two people. This film is well-acted and they story is well-written. Despite Kate Winslet's bravo performance, it's really hard to sympathize with her character because of the crimes she performed. This is one powerful film. I rate this film 9/10.",9,0,0,25 December 2013
Jaws," Classic Film!
","Jaws is a really good film. This is the movie that launched Spielberg's career into the heights that has never been reached before. The story for Jaws is simple. It's about a man-eating shark that terrorizes a town of Amity Beach and three people must trap and kill the shark:a police chief, a marine biologist, and a boat captain. For most of the movie, Jaws is intense and keeps you on your seat anticipating what is going to happen next. The action scenes featuring the shark are wonderful to watch even though there is a little gore. However, there are a couple scenes that are boring. These scenes occur basically towards the middle of the movie. The music in this film definitely rockstarted John William's career. The shark melody is mesmerizing. The acting, directing, and cinematography are all top-rate. I would advise parents not to show this to your children until they are at least 9. I rate this movie 9/10.",9,1,3,20 October 2008
The Wrestler," A Performance of the Ages!
","The Wrestler is one of the best movies to come out in 2008 mainly because of the out-of-this-world performance by Mickey Rourke. This is easily his best role he has ever done. Because his character, Ram and the actor himself have so many things in common, this is the perfect movie for Mickey. I could feel his pain and his emotions as if I was the main character.This film is about a lonely, washed up wrestler who tries to make amends with his daughter, fall in love with a stripper, and still do his job in the ring.Mickey Rourke did a performance of the lifetime, but so did Marisa Tomei. As the stripper, she added goodness and her character was likable. Evan Rachel Wood also did a very good job as the daughter of Ram.Overall, this is one heck of a drama with fantastic direction by Darren Aronofsky. I also loved the end credits song by Bruce Springsteen. I rate this film 9/10.",9,0,0,19 October 2012
Dark Shadows," Entertaining And Campy!
","It seems like most people despise this movie because it's a comedy, and not the serious TV show it was based off back in the 1970's. Sure this film has some mildly funny moments and is often campy, but it's more of a fun, Gothic movie that blends together effectively horror and comedic moments. This movie has impressive visuals and the cinematography is very good as we have come to expect with Tim Burton's films.Burton's film is about a vampire named Barnabas Collins who escapes his coffin after two-hundred years of imprisonment. He seeks out his relatives and as he plans to cope with living in the year 1972, he also plans to restore his family to their former glory.This is like the hundredth collaboration between Burton and Johnny Depp, but like always I don't mind. Depp brings a sort of charisma to his role and even though he's a blood-sucking vampire, we still like him. I like how he takes on these interesting roles that we come to know him for. The other actors here such as Michelle Pfeiffer, Chloe Grace Moretz, and Eva Green all do a good job and all seemed to have fun.Overall, this is a rather fun film to watch that boasts impressive visuals and some cool, Gothic action. It's nice that I cracked up a few times as well. This is not Tim Burton's best, but this is still typical of what we would expect from him. It's not meant to be a serious adaptation, but more of a light-hearted one. For one, I enjoyed this for the most part. I rate this film 8/10.",8,0,2,19 December 2013
Hancock," Will Smith does it again!
","I have always said that Will Smith is one of the best actors in Hollywood. He was great in the Men in Black series, I am Legend, and Independence Day. He was no different in this movie. This movie not about the superhero you expect. In fact, the superhero is exactly the opposite of a normal one. Will Smith's character is a drunk hero who contemplates suicide. Then with the advice of Ray Embrey, played by Jason Bateman, Hancock decides to turn a new leaf. But Embrey's wife adds a big mystery to the whole movie. The acting is great. I already talked about Will Smith but Charlize Theron and Jason Bateman were excellent cast choices. The action is fantastic. You never expect what would happen in the opening sequences. The music by John Powell goes well with the film. Overall, this is a great, must-see-again action film. My words of advice for this movie is do not listen to the negative reviews. I rate this movie 10/10.",10,2,5,27 November 2008
Hitch," A Pleasant Surprise!
","For whatever odd reason, I never thought Hitch would be a good movie but as usual, I was proved wrong. This is a sweet romantic comedy that is led by the star power of Will Smith. The story may be clichéd, but that doesn't matter when the charming performances and tight chemistry of stars overcomes the clichés.Andy Tennant's film is about a New York man who hires a man named Alex Hitchens also known as 'The Love Doctor' who set him up a date with the famous Allegra Cole. But his secret methods become known to the public after the investigation of a tabloid journalist.The acting is very good and charming. Will Smith is a bankable star, but he also knows how to act. His persona is exactly perfect for this film. Kevin James is really funny and he adds more to his clumsy fat guy role. Eva Mendes is okay but she seems a bit like a jerk.Overall, this is a good romantic comedy that's perfect for date night. I was hooked into the story and I was kind of sad when this film ended. I don't think this film would have worked without Will Smith. I rate this film 9/10.",9,0,1,19 August 2013
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," The Best Star Wars!
","The Revenge of the Sith is no doubt the best Star Wars movie ever. Even though the first two in the prequel series were good, this movie blows them away. Everything is so much better here in this movie such as the acting, more action, and better special effects.This movie is about the end of the Clone Wars and the transition for Anakin from the good side to the dark side. It was certainly nice to see Darth Vader again.The acting by Hayden is so much better. Hayden is so much better playing Anakin with the dark side. Ewan McGregor still impresses me as Obi-Wan.The classic lightsaber duel between Obi-Wan and Anakin is unbelievable. That has to be one of the best fights of all time in any movie. Also my favorite droid R2-D2 provided some good humor.Overall, this is the best Star Wars movie. George Lucas really put much effort in this movie. I rate this film 10/10.",10,3,6,17 December 2010
Ray," A Look Back At The Life of Ray Charles!
","This film, Ray, looks back at the iconic music legend Ray Charles. This film has an impressive lead performance by Jamie Foxx and in my opinion, Foxx seemed to transform himself into Ray with all his mannerisms and sound. I was very impressed. On the whole, this movie seems to be a little too long but there were so many events that transpired in Mr. Charles life, I can't blame the filmmakers for the length.Taylor Hackford's film is about the first thirty-six years of Ray Charles life. The movie talks about his inner demons and how he feels guilt for his brother's death. At age 9, he goes blind and from there we see his rise to the charts.Jamie Foxx does an incredible job and he deserves that Oscar. After watching this performance, I don't think any other actor could play Ray Charles. The supporting cast does solid as well especially Kerry Washington as Della Bea who stays by her husband's side during his ups and downs.Overall, this is a good biopic about an iconic music legend. It's sad he passed away right before this film was released. His music is very influential and should not be forgotten. I'm sure he would have liked this film. I learned a lot about the guy, but this film would have been better it wasn't a bit too long and didn't feature choppy editing. I rate this film 8/10.",8,2,3,1 August 2013
Shooter," Interesting Movie!
","Shooter is a pretty good movie that had its interesting moments. I got what I expected to be, an action-thriller movie that will entertain. I entertained cause Mark Wahlberg is one of Hollywood's bad boys. He plays a tough character every movie I have seen him in.This is another government conspiracy movie but I liked it despite what other people said. This is about a former soldier who is framed for the assassination attempt of the President.The acting is solid. I enjoyed Mark Wahlberg's tough act. Danny Glover is a convincing bad guy. This movie is actually the first I have ever seen of Glover being bad.Overall, this movie has some intense movies. But I think it was overshadowed by Bourne Ultimatum which also came out that year. I rate this film 8/10.",8,0,1,17 November 2010
The Lion King," An Instant Classic!
","The Lion King is the movie that will be honored fro the next thousand years. It's really that good! The movie starts with young Simba being shown to the rest of the world by this old monkey. As the movies goes on, King Mufasa is murdered by his own brother Scar. Scar also banishes Simba from the kingdom. In exile, Simba meets a warthog and a meercat. When Simba becomes an adult, he ventures back home to take on Scar and his hyena sidekicks. Even by today standards, this film has very good animation. Disney always does a good job with animation. The songs and score is excellent and praise-worthy. My favorite songs are 'Circle of Life' and 'Hakuna Matata.' The voice acting is full of brand-name talent such as James Earl Jones, Matthew Broderick, and Whoopi Goldberg. I do think that this movie is too violent for a G rating. It should be rated PG. Overall, an excellent family classic! I rate this movie 10/10.",10,4,6,7 November 2008
Inception," Stunning!
","Inception is a very good film. Just be aware that you may have to see this movie more than once to grasp the concept of this movie. This movie is designed to get you to think. I was able to understand the movie the first time I saw it and I'm going to see it in the future just for the heck of it.This movie is about a guy named Dom Cobb. His profession is to go in people's mind and steal their top secrets. Wanting to go home, Cobb must break apart the empire of a dying father and his son.The acting is perfect. I would not be surprised if Leonardo DiCaprio gets nominated for an Oscar. The other actors such as Joseph Gordon Levitt and Ellen Page were great.The visual effects are outstanding. I know this will be nominated for an Oscar in that category. The score composed by Hans Zimmer is perfect and fits in with the rest of the movie.Overall, this may be the best movie of Summer 2010. I rate this film a perfect 10/10.",10,0,7,9 December 2010
Defiance," Excellent, Powerful Film!
","This is one of the better World War Two movies released this decade. The Academy definitely overlooked this film. No, this is not Slumdog but it's close enough. I read some of the negative comments and the commenters must have been robots or they did not see this film.This is based on a true story. Basically, three Jewish brothers escape from the Germans to live in a forest with limited supplies and food. They end up making alliances with the Russian army.The acting is excellent. Daniel Craig, Liev Schrieber, Jamie Bell, they were all great! All the extras did a great job as well.The one thing that was not overlooked by the Academy is the music. James Newton Howard is a very good composer. Powerful music, indeed.Edward Zwick is a great director despite what everyone says about him. I seen Blood Diamond and The Last Samurai. This film is on par with those films or even better.Overall, this is a powerful film that should not be forgotten. I rate this film 10/10.",10,1,5,19 June 2009
Lord of War," Wow, What a Film!
","Lord of War is definitely a movie worth seeing. This is one of the best if not the best movie that involves dramatic acting by Nicolas Cage. It is unfortunate that not many people saw this movie but I guess that has to do with the subject matter.This movie tells the story of a gun dealer who sells guns to countries in Africa for a living.The acting is very good. Nic Cage should have seen some award recognition. I say the same for Ethan Hawke. He truly played the gritty cop part well.This is just one powerful, underrated movie. This kind of stuff does really happen in Africa and the Middle East so it is interesting to watch as well. I rate this film 9/10.",9,2,2,10 February 2012
Sherlock Holmes," Entertaining!
","The first time I saw this in theatres, I thought that this was a bore. I could hardly be comfortable watching this film. The second time I saw this was recently on DVD. Now that I had subtitles, I was able to be entertained. The reason I was bored the first time cause I had no idea what Robert Downey Jr. was saying. I needed subtitles for that.This is based of the classic books by Arthur Conan Doyle. This is about how Sherlock and his partner Watson go after the mysterious Lord Blackwood and they want to get to him before he destroys London.The acting is pretty good. Other than the problem I had with Downey, I loved the acting. Jude Law is great as Watson. As always Mark Strong plays a great villain.The production sets, sound, and music were great. I really thought well of the visuals.Overall, this is a solid movie. I expect the sequel to be more of the same. I rate this film 8/10.",8,0,1,14 November 2010
The Waterboy," Decently Funny!
","The Waterboy is not that bad of a movie. I have to say this is my least favorite Adam Sandler movie and I'm giving it a 7 so it says a lot about my liking of Sandler. Maybe it was the annoying voice of Sandler's character, but I felt detracted somewhat during the entire movie.This is about a water boy who becomes a 'star' football player on a ragtag team because he tackles his opponents harshly and without mercy. Meanwhile he has to keep this a secret all from his too-nosy mother.I didn't like Sandler's character a lot. I was disappointed about that. I did love Kathy Bates as his mother. Now she was the one who had me laughing.Overall, this a solid, watchable film. It has the same old formulaic sports story but I still liked it. I rate this film 7/10.",7,1,1,21 September 2011
WALL·E," Another Pixar Gem!
","Pixar has done it again! They created another beautiful, visual masterpiece with a great story for all ages. As of yet, I have not seen a Pixar movie I disliked.(I have not seen Cars 2 yet.) This movie shows probably the best robot romance in the history of films. This romance is somewhat believable as well.This film is about a worker robot who seems to be the only remaining moving thing left on Earth. However, a ship drops off a robot looking for signs of life. When the worker robot, Wall-E, lay eyes on her for the first time, that is when the magic begins.This is one of the best Pixar films I have seen better than all of them with the exception of the Toy Story trilogy. The visuals are very striking, the film moves at a great pace, and it has a good sense of humor. I rate this film 9/10.",9,0,2,12 July 2012
The Good Shepherd," Decent Spy Film!
","I believe that the Good Shepherd has the stuff to become a really good movie. The problem is that it just does not bring the potential out. I'm not saying this is bad, but it could've been way better.The story is about the beginning of the CIA. It follows a guy named Edward Wilson over a span of 30 years. It talks about how he's the man of little words and how his CIA job is taking him away from his family.The acting is great as it should be. The actors are all A-actors. Damon, Jolie, DeNiro, and Hurt did a very good job.This movie could have been shortened 20 minutes or so. There are several boring scenes that are not needed. But, the plot kept me hooked to the movie.Overall, this is a decent spy film. DeNiro did a great job in the director's seat. I rate this film 8/10.",8,0,0,16 June 2009
The Terminal," Brings Me A Good Feeling!
","The Terminal is one of the better feel-good movies I have seen in recent years. After watching it, I just felt so good about life because of this movie. This is why I can admit that Steven Spielberg is one of my favorite directors. He doesn't always make Oscar-friendly movies, which is good because he can make great films that are made to entertain, not win accolades. This film is very charming, has several funny moments even if didn't try to have them, has fantastic acting, and it basically answers the question of what living in an airport would be like.Spielberg directs a film about a guy named Viktor Navorski who is traveling to New York, but is denied entry to America. He is not allowed to return home as well because his country is at war. So, that means he is forced to stay at JFK. While there, he learns English, makes some friends, has encounters with a by-the-book Director of Customs, and even finds love.The acting is very good. In recent years, we haven't much called Tom Hanks funny. But he returns to his comedic roots as Viktor and shows he can be funny without trying. He has such an impeccable taste when it comes to his timing. Catherine Zeta-Jones is solid as the flight attendant Viktor falls for. In every movie Stanley Tucci has been in, he manages to steal his scenes. That means he is excellent in this film.Overall, The Terminal is one of Spielberg's awesome feel-good movies. This movie is not meant to win awards, but it has an objective to please the audience and give them quality entertainment. This film can be schmaltzy at times, but in a very good way. The screenplay is very well-written and is often heart-touching. John Williams contributes another great score, though a little low-key. Another fine directorial effort by Spielberg. I rate this film 9/10.",9,1,2,11 May 2014
The Blind Side," Powerful Drama!
","The Blind Side is one of the best dramas of the year 2009. It has a heart, is truly moving, and made me sympathize with the character Michael Oher. I never really thought much about this until I saw that this was nominated for Best Picture and Best Actress. I wish I saw this film back in theaters, because this film is so good.This is the true, inspirational story based on the life of first-round NFL draft pick Michael Oher. This film tells the story of how he was living on the streets and a kind, Christian family let him into their family.Sandra Bullock give is one heck of a performance. This film is definitely her best film. She gives substance to her character and also portrays her as fearless. I just loved that scene where she is talking to the gangsters as if she is the boss. The other actors such as Tim McGraw, the young Lily Collins, and Quinton Aaron all did a fantastic job.Overall, this is a very powerful, inspirational drama. I seen critics blast this film because it is too racist or too religious. I would throw that out the window and watch this film if you haven't. It's very good. I rate this film 9/10.",9,0,1,27 November 2012
The Shawshank Redemption," Unforgettable!
","The Shawshank Redemption really deserves the number one spot here on IMDb Top 250. This movie is so powerful and has to be in the top five best movies I have ever seen. This and Schindler's List were two movies I have seen in the past few days for the first time. I should have watched them eons ago.This is about some guy who is wrongfully sent to prison for the murders of his ex wife and her lover. While at prison, he befriends a black prisoner who's been there forever. While their friendship lasts, he makes changes to the prison society.The acting is powerful. The chemistry between Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins is just marvelous. Morgan Freeman is my favorite actor of all time and I'm starting to like Tim Robbins more and more.I can't believe this movie didn't take home any Oscars. I thought Forrest Gump is a very good movie and I haven't seen Pulp Fiction yet but this movie beats them all.Overall, this is a fantastic film. I was moved by the characters. This movie also have several twists so beware of that. I rate this movie 10/10.",10,0,0,13 November 2010
Rango," Beautiful Animation!
","The beautifully-animated Rango is one of the best animation films of 2011. I'm glad it won Best Animated Feature at the Oscars because it clearly deserved it. This is like one of those 1960's spaghetti westerns but this film is even better than those. I liked the fact on how many movies this film paid homage to. It is just worth the admission price to see the gleefully awesome ways on how this movie paid homage.Gore Verbinski's film is about a household chameleon stumbles across a town in the desert that is lacking in water. With inventive stories, Rango makes a name for himself and becomes an instant success and a hero. But, sooner or later, he is going to have to prove himself.This film has such a great voice cast. I'm not surprised with the Johnny Depp casting because he seems to be in every Verbinski film but Depp does the role just right. I liked the great supporting cast of Ned Beatty, Ray Winstone, Isla Fisher, Abigail Breslin, and many more.Overall, this is a smart, well-made animated film that ranks high in my favorite animations of all time list. This film is funny, witty, and has a great message. I liked the scenes which featured the narrating, musical birds. They were so depressing, but in a good and funny way. This is also an example of a western film done right despite the animation. I rate this film 9/10.",9,1,1,29 January 2013
Music and Lyrics," Sweet and Charming!
","Music and Lyrics is actually one of the better rom-coms made in the past decade. It's a little cheesy, but who can't resist the sappiness and charm of the film which works thanks to the two irresistible stars and an excellent soundtrack. As a fan of 80's music, I know a thing or two about washed-up musicians, so I enjoyed the film even more. I'm one of those people who believe in this sort of love, so I was even more interested. Finally, I also love the inside joke this movie makes about modern pop music. Those who like 70's/80's music know what I'm talking about.Marc Lawrence's film is about a man named Alex Fletcher who is a has-been star of the 80's hit band, POP!. When a young famous musician in the style of Lady Gaga asks him to write a song, he needs to find a lyricist fast. When he learns how talented his plant lady is with words, they become an unexpected pair with an unexpected romance.This film really works because of Hugh Grant's charm and Drew Barrymore's sweetness. I never knew that Grant could sing, but does he ever have a good voice! And as usual, he is good at being funny. Drew Barrymore has always been a respectable actress and that continues her as the flawed plant girl who is afraid to stand up for herself. Haley Bennett does a good job portraying the typical modern pop star in the vein of Lady Gaga and Taylor Swift.Overall, Music and Lyrics is a sweet though unusual rom-com. This film is almost like a musical, and it works big time. The soundtrack is very catchy and honestly the songs sung in the film will be a good addition to my expansive collection of songs on my Ipod. It's well-written, which it should be since a good portion of the plot is based around writing. Now this is the kind of smart rom-com I want to see on Valentine's Day. I rate this film 9/10.",9,8,18,28 October 2014
Platoon," Another 80's Classic!
","I think the 1980's was a good time for movies. That's the decade when action and war movies gained popularity. Just look at Die Hard, Lethal Weapon, Rambo, and now this. This is the best war movie of the decade no doubt about it. According to my father, this movie depicts the Vietman War in a very accurate way.The Vietnam War is described through the eyes of a young soldier. he explains all the terrible things that happened. He also talks about his two sergeants and how the evil one started a village massacre.The acting is very good. This movie introduces the famous Two And a Half Men star, Charlie Sheen. I was really surprised to see the amazing Johnny Depp.Overall, this is a powerful war movie. This picture definitely deserved the Best Picture Oscar. I rate this film 9/10.",9,2,4,17 July 2010
Prometheus," One of the Better Sci-Fi Movies In Recent Years!
","Prometheus, the long-awaited prequel set in the Alien/Aliens universe, is one of the best sci-fi films of the past few years. Ridley Scott, who directed 1979's Alien, returns to make a film of the same stature: a brilliant, tense film that has a very forbidding atmosphere. The dark, bleak visuals tells us what we need to know about the story. The special effects are very good and they enhance the story. Speaking of which, the story is very captivating and it makes us care what is going to happen next.Scott's film is set in the year 2093 and a discovery has been made about a civilization existing many light-years away from Earth. It's believed that this discovery may hold the key to existence of the human race. So financed by the Weyland Corporation, a group of people set out to find this civilization.....and this is where discovery turns to survival.The acting is really good. Noomi Rapace may not be like Signourey Weaver's Ripley, but she still does pretty good in my opinion. Michael Fassbender as the android delivers a very compelling performance. Charlize Theron plays your typical company person, but does it very well. Guy Pearce makes a surprising few appearances and does it well.Overall, this is an excellent, bleak sci-fi film that will please fans of the Alien films. This was one of the most anticipated films of 2012 and it delivers for the most part. There are twists and turns that comes during the most unexpected times and the ending will leave you with your mouth hanging wide open. A satisfying conclusion is what I think. This is a very good film and one of Ridley Scott's best directorial efforts. I rate this film 9/10.",9,2,10,5 January 2014
Despicable Me," Wonderful Animation!
","Despicable Me is one of the better animated movies released this year. I think the only ones better than this were Toy Story 3 and How to Train Your Dragon. This movie probably will be nominated for Best Picture at the Oscars but it will lose to Toy Story 3. Even so, this movie is a great movie to take the whole family to see.This is about some evil villain who adopts three young girls so they can help him thwart his nemesis plans on taking over the moon.The voice acting is pretty good. I could recognize the funny Steve Carell.This movie has plenty of laughs. Even though this is a kid movie, I laughed a few times. The little, yellow minions are really funny.Overall, this is a great movie to take your kids to see. I rate this film 9/10.",9,1,1,19 December 2010
Back to the Future Part II," A Magical Second!
","From what I heard from countless numbers of people, the Back to the Future sequels are better than the first film. That does not strike a chord with me because I think most sequels are better than the original. Anyway, Part 2 is better than Part 1.The plot is more complex in this story. We travel from the 80's to mid 2010's to 80's to 50's to alternate 80's or something like that. Marty McFly must travel to the future to save his kids from criminal justice and back in the past to save his life as he knows it.The original cast is wonderful. Michael J.Fox and Christopher Lloyd all stand out in their outstanding performances. It was a pity that Crispin Glover did not return. Jeffrey Weissman did a believable job as Glover and his character in what little screen time he had.Spielberg and Zemeckis certainly did a good job with the future. My favorite part was the Jaws 10.Overall, this is a magical movie that will not be forgotten through the next century. I rate this film 9/10.",9,1,2,14 April 2009
The Queen," All Hail Helen!
","After watching Helen Mirren's magnificent performance in the Queen, I think Dame Helen should become the queen herself, of course figuratively speaking. Her portrayal as Queen Elizabeth II in the midst of tragedy was incredible and very realistic as if she was actually the Queen. The film itself is a fantastic movie and it can be a little emotionally overpowering at times. It's a character-driven drama that tests the true strengths and weaknesses of character.Stephen Frear's film takes place during the immediate aftermath of Princess Diana's fatal car accident. The royal family keep to themselves and don't even offer public recognition, much to the outrage of the people. Newly elected Tony Blair is the link between the monarchy and the people and it's up to him to face all the pressures and satisfy both sides.Enough cannot be said about Helen Mirren's performance with gave her a deserving Oscar win. Her realism is through the roof and no one can play the Queen better than she can. Michael Sheen makes for an excellent Blair who uses all his resources to get the recognition Diana deserved. James Cromwell delivers a fine performance as Prince Philip, who is adamant about staying hidden.Overall, The Queen is an excellent film led by the magnificent Helen Mirren, who perfectly captured the essence of the Queen. The film also shows how Diana was about the people, despite her extravagant lifestyle. The people loved her dearly, and it's quite incredulous how the royal family did not see that. But after all was said, I still deeply admire the Queen. A great film about one of the darkest times for the royal family. I rate this film 9/10.",9,0,0,21 January 2015
Raging Bull," Fantastic Film!
","Raging Bull is one of the best movies Martin Scorcese has made. This is also one of the best dramas I have ever seen. I think it deserved more than the two Oscars it won. At least Robert DeNiro got his well-deserved Oscar. Despite this film being about a boxer and that there were boxing scenes in this movie, this movie is not a sports movie.This movie is very much about a guy, Jake La Motta, who is one of the best boxers out there. Despite the unrealistic boxing, this movie shows what kind of character Jake is. It shows how he is emotionally unstable and how he destroys the lives of the ones he loves including his brother and wife.The acting is just out-of-this-world. This is the finest acting performance I have ever seen Robert DeNiro do. Joe Pesci and Cathy Moriarty deliver very strong performances as well.This movie shows why Martin Scorcese is one of the greatest directors ever in cinema. He proves that by making movies such as this and Taxi Driver.Overall, I really loved this film even though I am not a fan of black and white. I rate this film 10/10.",10,2,4,7 May 2012
The Iron Giant," Fantastic Film!
","The Iron Giant is an underrated animation film and is just plain excellent, more so than it ever has a right to be. On paper, it's practically an animated version of E.T, but the film works despite the non-original story. It is full of substance and style with an underlying political commentary that will appeal to the adults. The kids will love the gorgeous animation (very good for a 1999 film) and the story about an unlikely friendship. I haven't seen this in many, many years until recently, but it was always one of my childhood standouts.Brad Bird's earliest theatrical film is about a kid named Hogarth befriends a giant robot from another world, during the height of the Cold War and the launch of Sputnik. Hogarth tries to protect the giant-sized robot not only from his mother, but also from a bunch of bureaucrats believing the giant is actually a spy for the Soviet Union.The voice acting is not that bad. The robot does not speak English at first, but when he does, it was voiced by Vin Diesel who made the robot seem even more lifelike. We also have some solid voice acting from the likes of Jennifer Aniston, Harry Connick Jr., and Eli Marienthal.Overall, The Iron Giant is one of those rare gems that appeal to both adults and children. The story is executed well enough against the backdrop of political and historical issues and the film is also a visual spectacle with the animation way beyond its time. Who cannot resist a film among the veins of ET, especially one that is good as this. It's a beautiful, must-see film. I rate this film 9/10.",9,1,2,6 December 2014
Taken 2," Decent Sequel!
","Taken 2, the sequel to the massive 2009 hit Taken, is an average sequel that's still entertaining and quite interesting. Compared to the first film, it's a step-down. Sometimes the plot felt a bit forced and it feels similar to the first film. Frankly, the writing is not the best either. But it's still feasible entertainment thanks to the charm and charisma of Liam Neeson, lots of good action, and some gorgeous location shots in places like Istanbul.Olivier Megaton's film has ex-CIA Bryan Mills returning in this sequel. After he invites his daughter and ex-wife to come with him to Istanbul, things go south when family of the victims he killed in the first film seek retribution.I can't complain about Liam Neeson returning because as always, he knows how to kick butt. he's a bona fide action star and for someone his age, he is very spry. I wouldn't say Maggie Grace is the best actress but despite some annoying whining in the film, she does okay. Famke Janssen has a bigger role in the film and I think she does a good job.Overall, Taken 2 is not better than the original but it does it's job in entertaining the audience, or I should say me since not many people were thrilled with the film. Despite some flaws, it's a solid action film and nothing more than that. I rate this film 8/10.",8,0,2,26 March 2014
Shrek," Very Amusing!
","Shrek is one of my favorite animated movies of all time. It's up there with the wonderful Pixar films. I think this will be an iconic movie for ages to come. I didn't enjoy it that much when it first came out but that was nine years ago. Now that I saw it again, this movie is very amusing and enjoyable.This is about an ogre whose mission is to stay away from humans. When his swamp is infested with fairy tale creatures, he and his new buddy Donkey travel to a castle to rescue the Princess Fiona and take her to the Lord Farquaad in order to get his swamp back.The characters here were wonderful. My favorite character is this movie and the whole series in fact is Donkey. Eddie Murphy certainly did something right this decade. Camerion Diaz has a wonderful voice as well.Overall, this is a wonderful animation movie. The animation is beautiful and the CGI works well with the film. I rate this film 9/10.",9,0,1,14 November 2010
X-Men: First Class," Best X-Men Yet!
","X-Men: First Class is one of the best if not the very best X-men film ever released. Even though I liked The Last Stand and Origins, many people did not. This film will definitely bring the disappointed fans back into goodwill for this series. This film clearly defines what an X-Men movie should be. It has a convincing story, comic similarities, great acting and character development(which is important in X-Men), and a practical use of special effects(which were very good).Matthew Vaughn's film is about the origins of the mutants and the story of how Professor X and Magneto met when they were young. This film takes place during the Cold War when Russia and the United States were facing their darkest times with each other.This movie has a very good all-star cast and some younger actors who are quickly rising in fame such as the lovely Jennifer Lawrence. James McAvoy as X and Michael Fassbender as Magneto couldn't have been better for their roles. I must mention that Kevin Bacon makes a very convincing villain.Overall, this is definitely one of the best X-Men films released to date. Matthew Vaughn has proved himself to be a very good, artistic director as he so proves her. For fans of the original series, they will love the surprise in this film. I know I did. I rate this film 9/10.",9,0,2,17 February 2013
The Wolverine," Wolverine's Character Profile!
","Now when X-Men Origins: Wolverine came out in 2009, I was one of the handful who actually enjoyed it despite its flaws. Now flash forward four years later and we get another Wolverine standalone movie, but this time the film takes place after the events of 2006's The Last Stand, which I liked. I also liked how this film is purposely slow as the movie tries to explain the deep feelings of our protagonist and his desire to die. I liked the new direction of the film and while it takes it time, there are several great action scenes and one involving a fight on top of a bullet train.James Mangold's film starts off with The Wolverine saving a Japanese soldier's life during the dropping of the atomic bomb in Nagasaki. Flash forward many years later, Wolverine is living life as a mountain man feeling guilty of Jean Grey's death. When he gets the call to come to Japan, he meets the soldier again who is now an old man near death. The old man offers him a way out of his grief and his immortal being. Now can the Wolverine accept a mortal life? This film does not require a whole slew of A-list stars and we don't get them other than the iconic Hugh Jackman as Wolverine. Hugh was fantastic as always and he plays the part well with even more scowls and brooding which we come to expect. Famke Janssen makes several appearances as Wolverine's now deceased love. Two Japanese actresses, Tao Okamoto and Rila Fukushima, are excellent as Wolverine's female companions. The villain of the film, played by Russian actress Svetlana Khodchenkova, was perhaps the weakest part of the film. Her portrayal as Viper was not that convincing.Overall, The Wolverine is an excellent character study of a flawed man full of guilt and is longing for being mortal. Some people complain about how the film is slow and boring. Unfortunately people don't like a personal character study these days. What little action there is, it's pretty impressive. Even if the final action scene is repetitive of films from the past, but it was well done. As a character study, this film excels. I rate this film 9/10.",9,2,4,27 October 2014
The Dark Knight Rises," The Perfect Conclusion to a Perfect Trilogy!
","Christopher Nolan's ambitious Batman trilogy has come to a close with perhaps one of the greatest superhero films ever made. Both Batman Begins and the Dark Knight were cinematic masterpieces and are complimented nicely with this film, The Dark Knight Rises. Being the longest film in the series, it has incredible set pieces, a sinister villain, excellent acting, a loud and bombastic score by Hans Zimmer, and lots of emotional depth.Nolan's film takes place eight years after the events of the Dark Knight and Bruce Wayne has moved into seclusion. Regarding Gotham, crime has been suppressed with the Dent laws, but now a new force led by the notorious Bane is threatening to take control over Gotham. So is it time for Bruce to give his cowl and cape another shot? This film has a plethora of characters so events may be confusing at time(which it wasn't for me.) Christian Bale as always is near perfect as Batman and he adds some emotional depth to his eccentricity. Michael Caine has a bigger role here and has some of the biggest, most emotion-filled dialogue of the film. While different in stature from the Joker, Tom Hardy makes a great Bane and reminds me greatly of Hannibal. Both Gary Oldman and Morgan Freeman return and are amazing. I didn't think Anne Hathaway as Catwoman would be effective, but I was proved wrong. Joseph Gordon-Levitt brings his talent as well as a few surprises to the film.Overall, this is an amazing ending to the greatest superhero trilogy. Some of the set pieces are just amazing and incredible to watch. The football stadium, the opening sequence with the airplanes, and the takeover of the stock exchange were just a few of my favorite sequences. But nothing competes with that amazing, action-packed finale. Some people may not like the ending at all, but I think it's a fair way to end the film. It's unfortunate that the movie shooting in Colorado overshadowed this film, but I want to point out movie violence is not the cause for real-life violence and we shouldn't abandon the theaters because of this heinous act. This film is amazing and I'm pretty sad that the trilogy is over. I rate this film 10/10.",10,6,10,1 February 2014
The Croods," A Delightful Family-Oriented Movie!
","The Croods is actually a very good, family-pleasing DreamWorks animated film that is better than expected because of a well-written story and some excellent voice acting. Who knew that an animated movie about a bunch of prehistoric people would receive an Oscar nomination. Speaking of the animation, the film is also visually impressive as this should be eye candy for everyone. As for the jokes, some are actually quite funny and most of them do not fall flat.Kirk De Macco and Chris Sander's film is about a bunch of prehistoric people named the Croods whom do not like to try new things and they spend the majority of their days holed up in a cave. However the daughter, Eep wants to do things and she runs away from home much to her father's, Grug displeasure and she learns about what will happen. But due to a changing world, the family must leave their cave and venture out in the wilderness to begin a new life.This film has an impressive voice cast. Nicolas Cage finally chooses a good role as of late and does a neat job voicing the concerned, stubborn Grug. Emma Stone shows she can do well in animation as the voice of Eep. Then we have some good voicework from the likes of Ryan Reynolds, Catherine Keener, and Cloris Leachman.Overall, The Croods is much better than anyone could hope for and it's pleasing animated fare for the entire family. The kids will love this, and I think the adults would be pleasantly surprised. Somehow, this film reminds me of Ice Age and I think that is a favorable comparison because I enjoy those films. But thanks to beautiful animation, a good story, excellent voice-acting, and of course from that prehistoric teen angst, we get a very good family film. I rate this film 9/10.",9,0,0,29 July 2014
Iron Man," Great Movie!
","Iron Man is one of the better superhero movies. It's based off the popular Marvel comics. On one of the reviews, I was shocked to see that the person liked the new Hulk better. I agree that Hulk is a great movie, but Iron Man is 100 times better. Tony Stark, a popular weapons company owner gets kidnapped by a cult called 'Ten Rings' in the Middle East. They want Stark to build a weapon for them. Instead he builds his Iron Man suit. He eventually escapes and later becomes Iron Man. Will he have revenge on the cult and it's surprising leader? You'll have to watch to find out. The acting is better than expected in this film. Robert Downey Jr. did such a unexpected great job. Gwyneth Paltrow did well as her role of Pepper Potts. I also liked Terrence Howard as Rhodey. The special effects were great as they are with superhero movies. The plot has its share of intriguing twists. I believe that this Iron Man is original, but that is my opinion. I rate this movie 10/10.",10,12,15,17 November 2008
Blade Runner," OK at the best!
","Blade Runner is not a good movie, but it is not a bad movie either. It's only OK. I don't know how people could love this or hate this because this movie has everything in between. The story takes place in 2019 and is about a a guy named Deckard who is a cop that must destroy replicants or robots that are on Earth since they have been banned. The acting is good. Harrison Ford did good, even though he did not like Ridley Scott. The music was OK. At least there is something different about the music. The problem with this film is that it's too dark and boring. I could hardly see the movie on my television and I was watching it during the evening. I also thought that this is kind of boring. The action scenes are few between. The ending is confusing and stupid. I was shocked at the ending because it was so abrupt. Overall, this is interesting, but not worthy of an Oscar. Basically, it's OK. My rating is 6/10.",8,1,5,6 October 2008
Bruce Almighty," Very Funny!
","This film is the best film Jim Carrey has ever made. Carrey did not have his usual face making stuff in this film. He was both funny and sad. Carrey played a reporter named Bruce Nolan. Nolan blames God(Morgan Freeman) for everything that goes wrong in his life. Then, God comes down from heaven and gives Bruce his powers. As I said before, Carrey did an excellent job. I also thought that Morgan Freeman and Jennifer Aniston were great as supporting actor/actress. The plot was good because it had many subpoints in the main point. This movie can be funny(Bruce's dog) as well as sad(the 'break-up'). The script worked well, too. I am glad they made a sequel to this film. I rate this film a 9/10.",9,1,2,9 December 2007
Monsters University," Better Than Expected!
","Now before I start this review, I must ask did we need a prequel to 2001's Pixar hit, Monster's Inc? I didn't think so, but I was pleasantly surprised how lovely and amusing this film turned out to be. It was an interesting take to tell the story of Mike and Sully before their fame in the previously-mentioned film. This film is really appealing and colorful and this will charm newcomers and fans alike. As a Pixar film, it's a vast improvement on Cars 2 and Brave (which weren't bad, but not like Pixar.) Don Scanlon's film brings us the return of Mike and Sully in their pre-Monsters Inc. days as we see them as bitter rivals at Monsters University. Because of some complications including everyone's doubt of Mike being a scarer, Mike and Sully team up to compete in the Scare Games which would show of they are any good after all.With the return of Mike and Sully, of course we would have the return of the welcome voices, Billy Crystal and John Goodman. They didn't lose a step in the twelve years between film. Steve Buscemi also returns as Randall and does a really fine job. I also must mention Helen Mirren, because she gives her best animation work as the evil headmistress of the school.Overall, Monsters University is a really sweet and charming Pixar film. I wasn't clamoring for a new film involving these characters, but I'm glad we got one. This isn't the best Pixar movie either nor the most original one, but it's still entertaining and a really nice way to take a trip down memory's lane. The animation is excellent and a good improvement and it's nice to have Randy Newman back as composer as he contributes a fun, jazzy score. This is perfect for both kids and adults alike and in that regard, it's another success for Pixar. I rate this film 9/10.",9,0,0,2 October 2014
Ben-Hur," At A Lost For Words!
","Ben-Hur is how to properly make an epic film. What makes this film stand out by today's standards is how it does not use computers to enhance this film. That makes the impressive chariot scenes become already even more impressive. This is a true epic that relies on acting and a well-written screenplay. The score is very good thanks to a memorable theme. At about three and a half hours, this film is very long but with such an effective story, time flew by fast.William Wyler's film is a historical epic that takes place in the ancient land of Judea. Judah Ben-Hur is sold into slavery by his old Roman friend and Ben-Hur returns with a desire of revenge.This film has very impressive acting. Charlton Heston is on top of his game as Ben-Hur. Stephen Boyd is also really good as his Roman archenemy. I don't have a bad thing to say about any actor here since they're all very good.Overall, this is a very impressive historical epic. Compared to the Ten Commandments, I like this film even more. I'm still amazed by the chariot races and they hold up very well today. A classic tale of revenge, but I liked the additions of Christianity symbols because they simply add on to the film. This film is essentially a battle between the pagan Romans and the monotheistic Jews. A very good film and one deserving of multiple viewings despite the long length. I rate this film 9/10.",9,0,2,15 March 2014
Casino Royale," Best Bond Movie Yet!
","I think that this Bond movie is the best of all the Bond movies. Just like Batman Begins, Casino Royale regenerates the Bond series in a positive way. Daniel Craig is definitely the best choice to play Bond. He looked right for the role and I like the way he played Bond. In Casino Royale, Bond has to stop a terrorist organization and to do that, he plays card games. This is a butt-kicking, non-stop action thriller avid actions fans have been waiting for. Judi Dench returns as her role as 'M'. She is a bit more creepy, but she still performs her role well. The acting was great, the screenplay was great, and the score kept you in your seats anticipating on what will happen next. The visual effects were simply amazing. Overall, this is one of the best films you will ever see. You should go and see it! I rate this beauty a 10/10.",10,1,7,9 December 2007
Toy Story 3," May Be the Best Trilogy Ever!
","The Toy Story trilogy is up there being one of the best trilogies ever rivaling the great Lord of the Rings trilogy. Every single Toy Story movie happened to be the best animated film of that particular year including this one. No film can beat this out. Not even How to Train You Dragon.The toys are back along with a few new toys including Ken and Lotso, a cuddly-looking bear. Woody, Buzz, and the gang are donated to Sunnyside and things are bad for them. It's up to Woody to save the day.It's been eleven years and the voice talent remains the same. Hanks and Allen are perfect. It was nice to hear Michael Keaton and Ned Beatty play Ben and Lotso respectively.I read some reviews on people who hated this. They hated it because it was G-rated. Come on. Give me a break.Overall, this is the way to end the trilogy. I was moved emotionally during some scenes. I rate this movie 10/10.",10,0,1,6 February 2011
Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs," Another Great Ice Age!
","I hope they keep on making Ice Age sequels because they're pretty darn good. I loved the second movie and this movie is almost as good as that one. I'm glad that all the original characters returned especially Scrat. I liked the new characters in Scrat's girlfriend and Buck.This time around, Sid is kidnapped by a Tyrannosaurus Rex because he stole her eggs. Now Manny, Diego, Crash, Eddie, and the pregnant Ellie must join forces with the wild Buck to rescue Sid.The animation is great. I loved the way on how they designed the dinosaur world underneath the real world. As the years pass by, the animation gets better. Overall, this is a family fun great that I would watch over and over again. I rate this film 9/10.",9,1,3,20 June 2010
Bull Durham," Pleasant Baseball Rom-Com!
","Bull Durham is a really good baseball film that doesn't only give you the finer points of baseball, but it supplies the audience with a good amount of well-developed characters. This film is supposed to be a comedy, but I didn't see it as one. Sure, there were some funny moments but I feel this movie should be seen more as a feel-good drama. With a light atmosphere, this film is a great date night film for sure. Even those who don't like baseball would like this film.Ron Shelton's film is about a 12-year veteran catcher of the minor leagues named Crash Davis who is assigned to mentor hotshot pitcher Ebby 'Nuke.' Along their moments of bondage, they rival each other in getting the attention of Annie who believes in the 'Church of Baseball' and she has a program where she chooses one player per season to be her lover.This film is well-acted. Because of his acting abilities and natural athleticism, Kevin Costner does really well in this film. Perhaps one of his finest film roles rivaling Field of Dreams. Tim Robbins, who is a newcomer here, does very well and is quite a dandy to watch. Susan Sarandon has plenty of talent and she makes great use of it here.Overall, this film is one of the greatest baseball films made. It is not really funny, but more witty. I love the confrontations on the mound between Costner and Robbins since they show such great chemistry. This movie is basically a three-run home run right here. Perhaps one of the finest baseball films to hit this planet thanks to it's big heart and well-developed characters. I rate this film 9/10.",9,1,1,11 January 2014
Before Sunrise," Very Thought-Provoking!
","Before Sunrise, the first film in the trilogy by Richard Linklater, is a very powerful, thought-provoking film that I never thought would be good. This film has no action and is merely conversation, so how can this movie be so good? Well, this movie is about as close to reality as you can get. What happens in this movie could happen to anybody out there. Secondly, the script is tight and well-written. I really loved all these meaningful, philosophical conversations. I'm usually bored at mostly talk films, but the way I was grabbed into these conversations really means the movie worked.Linklater's film is about a French girl on her way back to school and an American guy heading to Vienna to take a flight home and how they started a connection with each other when they met on the train.The acting is about as good as you can get. Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy have great chemistry and the way they delivered the dialog is just special. There is no need for supporting characters because the focus is on these two characters and their meanings of life.Overall, this is a very special, powerful film. I honestly didn't want to see this movie since I thought it would be a stupid romantic comedy, but it is really not. It's a drama that's thoughtful, funny, poignant, and just very sweet. I honestly don't get this 'R' rating because the dialog would be very meaningful for teens. For those who love cinema, this is a great movie to watch. I rate this film 9/10.",9,0,0,6 August 2013
Signs," Quite Interesting!
","Signs is a pretty good sci-fi thriller. I haven't been able to watch this movie until now but I kind of knew what would happen because I saw this movie spoofed in 2003's Scary Movie 3. Needless to say, this is a very well-acted film and quite possibly M.Night Shymalan's best film after the Sixth Sense.This is about a former reverend and his family finding a unusual crop circle in the corn crops in their backyard. Now these crop circles are destined to bring the end of the world via alien invasion.As I mentioned before, the acting is superb. Mel Gibson turns in another quality performance, possibly his last. Joaquin Phoenix did a pretty good job as his brother.Overall, this is a solid film. I was creeped out for a good portion of it. And people should back down about the faith of this film. It's pretty insane. I rate this movie 8/10.",8,1,4,20 November 2011
The Deer Hunter," Decent But Overrated Film!
","If it wasn't for the first hour or so, this movie would have been a masterpiece. For the beginning scenes with the wedding reception, I was bored out of my mind. I was about to turn this movie off because I thought it would not get better. But when the Vietnam scenes appeared at long last, this was when I was blown away.This is about a group of guys who head to Vietnam but they were captured and sent to a POW camp. Eventually, they were able to go to America. Since one of their guys were left behind, the character of Robert De Niro goes back to the horrors of Vietnam to rescue the guy.The acting is pretty darn good even in the beginning. The performances by De Niro and Christopher Walken are amazing. Meryl Streep did a credible job too.Overall, this is a good movie but it's overrated and way too long. If they edited it properly and cut down the length by at least a half hour, it would have been a masterpiece. I rate this film 7/10.",9,0,1,28 October 2010
Saving Mr. Banks," The Story of How Mary Poppins Came To Be!
","In 1961, Walt Disney invited P.L Travers, the author of Mary Poppins to his California studios to negotiate the rights for her classic novel. The rest is history. Saving Mr. Banks is a movie that tells how the film adaptation came to be and the struggles that occurred during pre-production. The movie itself is charming and is an uplifting story as it is in classic Disney mode. The movie has strong acting and a wonderful score by Thomas Newman. The movie is funny and also sad. The film is also told by using flashbacks, in which the story is greatly enhanced as we see the influence of the characters in Mary Poppins.John Lee Hancock's film tells the story how Walt Disney was able to secure the rights to Mary Poppins. But it was no easy task. P.L Travers is a very proud and proper woman. Because of dwindling book sales and financial trouble, Travers agrees to travel to L.A where she supervises the script. But she is not too easily impressed and it takes a trip down memory lane in order to inspire her heart and her mind.The strongest suit of the film is the impressive acting. Emma Thompson delivers one of her best roles as the stern and sometimes downright mean Travers. Her on screen persona makes her character watchable, even if she is disliked. Tom Hanks takes a step back in a supporting role and I thought he did a great job. However one can wonder if he was overly nice in portraying Disney. Paul Giamatti had a touching performance as Traver's driver. Even dealing with her rudeness, he always respected and was nice to Travers. Finally, Colin Farrell gave an extraordinary performance as Traver's alcoholic father, who she has deep admiration for.Overall, Saving Mr. Banks is an excellent family film that is essentially a two hour making-of documentary of Mary Poppins. But the film is so sweet and magical, and it is another film that is a recipient of Disney's magic. This film is better than it had every right to be. The performances, particularly Thompsons, is stellar. A end-of-the-year hidden gem. Now let's go watch some Mary Poppins! I rate this film 9/10.",9,0,1,19 January 2015
Beowulf," A Thrilling Epic!
","This film is actually a pretty good film. I was surprised on how this film turned out to be. This is about one guy, Beowulf who apparently came from Iceland. He helps a Danish village get rid of a monster named Grendel. After Grendel is defeated, Beowulf and his comrades has to fight even a bigger foe, the mother of Grendel played by Angelina Jolie. Will she be defeated? You will just have to find out. First of all, the acting is brilliant. Ray Winstone and Brendan Gleeson were the best. Next, the music theme is memorable. The score still is flowing through my mind at the moment. Finally, the CGI is amazing. The effects made the movie even more worthwhile. The only two reasons this movie does not get a 10 because it is a little slow at the beginning and there are several major differences between the movie and the poem. BNut other than that, this film is great. I recommend this film for anybody 12 or over. This film might be a little scary for younger children. I rate this film a 9/10.",9,6,10,27 February 2008
Fantastic Mr. Fox," Truly Underrated!
","Fantastic Mr. Fox is a really good animated feature, that despite its critical praise, is vastly underrated. I use this term because it made next to nothing at the box office and the audience have not been giving this movie the greatest reviews. But, this is what a Wes Anderson movie should be. A quirky tale with above-average storytelling.This is about a fox who goes back to his old ways and steals things from three angry, older men. These dastardly men now go for revenge against Mr. Fox, his family, and all his other animal friends.The voice casting works just fine. I recognized great talent such as Clooney, Streep, Murray, Wilson, and Gambon. Also, Wes Anderson's directing is solid and he stays true to the source material even though he obviously added some content.Overall, this is a great, underrated animated film. Studios should make more stop-motion films in the future. I rate this film 9/10.",9,0,4,7 December 2012
Speed," Fun Action Movie!
","Speed is another great action film that came out in the 1980's and 1990's. I think this film had the best villain though. Dennis Hopper's character was creepy and sadistic. This film has everything an action fan can hope for. It has great action, cool stunts, and some lovely romance.This film is about an LAPD cop who must try to save the day when a bus in armed with a bomb and if it goes slower than fifty miles per hour, it will explode.This is one of Keanu Reeve's better performances. He does better here than he did in the Matrix movies. Sandra Bullock does a good job in her role. But I really enjoyed Dennis Hopper as the villain with many tricks up his sleeves.Overall, this is one fun action film. It gave me enough adrenaline to keep me focused for the whole film. There are many cool stunts, sets, and special effects. I rate this film 9/10.",9,1,2,21 August 2012
Live Free or Die Hard," After 12 Years, John McClane Is Strong as Ever!
","This is a really good movie to add to the Die Hard trilogy. It's action-packed, fast-paced, incredible acting(at least by Willis and Olyphant), and a new kind of terror. This film is even better than the first film.John McClane is facing a new kind of terrorism, cyber terrorism. Some random dude and his sexy sidekick are hacking into computers and creating havoc across the East Coast using those computers. It's up to McClane and another hacker who accidentally gave the bad guys the code to start this terrorism to stop the acts of terrorism.The acting is very good. Bruce Willis returns at age 52 as John McClane and the characters is as wit-cracking and believable as ever. Timothy Olyphant did a fine job as the terrorist in charge. Maggie Q is just hot as the sidekick. Justin Long did so-so. I can think of better actors who can play Long's role better than him.There are great stunts and special effects. I really liked the scenes that involved the truck chase and the traffic lights all turning green at the same time. Overall, this is a fun sequel and we all deserve Die Hard 5. I rate this film 9/10.",9,1,3,1 February 2009
X2: X-Men United," Best in the Series!
","X2:X-Men United is by far the superior film compared to the first one. The first one released three years previously is a good film, but this film is much better. I was expected to be disappointed by this one but once again, I was proved differently.After an attack on the President, the gang of mutants come together to save the world and to find out who attacked the President.The acting ensemble is great. Hugh Jackman makes a fantastic Wolverine. The addition of Brian Cox as a villain to the cast certainly made things interesting.Overall, this is a great movie that has a good story, great acting, and great special effects. I rate this film 10/10.",10,1,2,3 December 2011
Thor: The Dark World," A Worthy Sequel!
","Thor: The Dark World, the sequel to the 2011 film and sort-of-spin off from 2012's The Avengers, is quite a spectacle. Thor isn't my favorite character from the Marvel universe, as I feel Captain America and Iron Man have better character arches, but Thor does have his moments. This film retained the well-liked humor from the first film and added more set pieces to the film to its advantage. The special effects are great and we are still treated to the visual beauty of Asgard. The only part of the film I felt was weak was the forced romance between Thor and Jane. But luckily for the rating, I didn't care too much.Alan Taylor, taking over from Kenneth Branagh in the director's chair, directs a film regarding Thor in the aftermath of New York. In this particular film, Thor must team up with his brother and nemesis Loki to stop the Dark Elves who are led by the malicious Malekith from plunging the world into darkness and once again saving Earth and the Nine Realms.Like many Marvel films, the film has an incredible array of actors and actresses working on the film. Chris Hemsworth as Thor is mighty as ever. Tom Hiddleston provides some of the best humor with his witty dialogue as Loki. Natalie Portman is okay as Jane, but I felt her romance with Thor was forced and unrealistic. Stellan Skarsgaard makes a welcome return and my favorite scene involves him at Stonehenge acting quite weird. Christopher Eccleston actually makes for a solid villain. Finally, we get some brief, but effective supporting turns from Anthony Hopkins, Idris Elba, and Rene Russo.Overall, the Thor sequel pushes up the stakes even more as Thor and Loki must try to the save the universe yet again. I loved the humor, willingly provided by Loki. I also loved how the film is action-packed without sacrificing anything for the story. Towards the end, we have a great action scene involving the travel between many worlds, so that was quite fascinating to watch. The visual effects are also impressive as well. This is an incredible sequel, about on par with the first film. There are also several scenes to keep an eye out for in the post-credits. I rate this film 9/10.",9,0,1,3 January 2015
Moonrise Kingdom," A Bit Strange.....But Then Again it's Wes Anderson!
","If you are a fan of Wes Anderson or a lover of excellent cinema, then this film, Moonrise Kingdom is for you. It's nothing short of strange, but I loved this vivid tale of storytelling. The way this film was set up is nearly exquisite. The visuals are striking and colorful especially for an indie film. The characters are an odd bunch, but you can feel that each character has goodness in them, no matter their weirdness or flaws.Wes Anderson's film is about a blossoming romance between two 12-year-olds and they run away from their town and that riles up the townspeople and tension amounts as they began to search for the kids.This film is well-acted. Newcomers Jared Gilman and Sara Heyward were impressive and they really had perfect though a purposefully awkward chemistry between them. Since this is a Wes Anderson film, Bill Murray is here. He does a very good job. Same can be said for Bruce Willis, Frances McDormand, and Edward Norton. These people may be a little on the dumb side, but you can't help liking them or at least sympathizing with them.Overall, this is yet another great film on Anderson's filmography. It tells a tale about romance and how people will go far as they can to keep their relationship intact. One amusing thing I noticed here is how it seems like their town is only made up of ten people. I found that pretty amusing. I found this film to be funny and beautifully written as well. The addition of the narrator adds some more quirkiness to the story. This is one of the best films of 2012 no doubt. I rate this film 9/10.",9,1,2,29 December 2013
The Sixth Sense," Better Than Expected!
","The Sixth Sense is actually better than I anticipated. I am not much of a horror/mystery genre fan. But I heard so much about this film for ten years now and I decided what the heck. I'm also a big fan of Bruce Willis so thats another reason why I saw this. This movie is a great thriller and I now know what the hype is all about.This is about a child psychologist who is experiencing family troubles. His job is too straighten out this kid who is different than other kids.The acting is very good especially by Willis and Haley Joel Osment. These two have very good chemistry.Now this movie has many twists including a big one. I was really shocked when I saw the twist.Overall, this is an above average thriller. I was also surprised to see this picture was nominated for Best Picture. I rate this film 8/10.",8,0,0,1 December 2010
RED," Delightful Fun!
","I really enjoyed Red. It's too bad that they don't make action movies like this anymore. This movie is for plain fun and will not win any major awards(I was surprised that this was Golden Globe nominated.) This movie also proves that the older generation still know how to kick some serious butt.This is about how a group of retired agents join forces together again to hunt down the ones who just tried to assassinate them.The cast is perfect. Bruce Willis stills has his action mojo. John Malkovich really played his part well as the crazy guy. The best part was Helen Mirren. It was funny to see the dame lift that enormous gun.Overall, this is a good action/comedy movie. I really hope they do make a second one. I rate this film 8/10.",8,1,2,26 January 2011
Flight," Tough Film to Watch!
","Flight is a very tough film to sit through and I don't say that because it's a bad film, it just has a very tough subject matter. Alcoholism is a tough subject in it's own right and the effects people have from it is not pretty. That being said, this film is a moving portrait of a guy who resorts to alcohol but at the same time is being hailed as a hero. This film has one of the best airplane sequences in film mainly because of the inverted plane. Now that is special effects talent right there.This film is a welcome return to live-action filmmaking by director Robert Zemeckis whose last live-action film was 2000's Cast Away. This film is about a pilot named Whip Whitaker who is an airplane pilot, but also a drunk. He is labeled as a hero when he saves many lives on a plane due to expert piloting. But he gets questioned when word gets out he may have been drunk when he crash-landed that plane.Denzel Washington gives one of his career-best performances and with his resume, that is a hard thing to do. Despite what he does, you still feel a little sympathy towards his character and that's the kind of human being Denzel is and the kind of characters he portrays. Don Cheadle is very good as the lawyer who keeps things guarded. John Goodman is quite funny as Whip's right-hand man. Bruce Greenwood is also good as Whip's loyal friend.Overall, Flight is a compelling character drama that takes an inside look at a condition that affects many people in the world today. People may not like this film due to the lack of action here. But as a character drama, it feeds us the emotion of the characters and we truly feel them. It's a very powerful film with one of Denzel's best performances to date. I rate this film 9/10.",9,1,3,2 April 2014
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2," The Perfect Finale!
","The Harry Potter saga came to a satisfying end with this film, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2. This is the perfect example of how to end a series of what was perhaps the best film franchise in history. This is as close as it gets when it comes to being flawless. The visuals are outstanding and gorgeous in 2D format, a story that packs an emotional punch is being told, and we see for sure that after a decade in the business, our young three main actors have grown up.David Yate's film starts off right where Part 1 leaves off. We see Harry, Ron, and Hermione hunting down the final Horcruxes which eventually will lead them to Hogwarts where they have a final showdown between good and evil.This film is well-acted, perhaps the best acting I have seen this series. Radcliffe, Grint, and Watson are essentially Harry, Ron, and Hermione in essence. I was very happy that Alan Rickman and Matthew Lewis got their dues in this film. Rickman had many scenes that tend to play heavy on the emotions and Lewis as Neville Longbottom really turned into the hero that made Gryffindor house proud. All-in-all, the acting was amazing.Overall, this is the best Harry Potter ever made. It's fitting that it had to be the last one to be the best but this has been the best film franchise I have ever seen and I am sad to see it go. I was not disappointed by the Battle of Hogwarts. All the technical work that was put into it was top-notch. It was epic in the book, but even more epic on-screen. I was very happy to hear the iconic John Williams themes here that have been absent for quite a few movies. This movie had the perfect ending and I'm glad they did not screw that up. I admit by the time the movie ended, a tear or two came to my eyes. The Boy Who Lived will always live on! I rate this film 10/10.",10,0,1,2 March 2013
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Breathtaking!
","The Return of the King is the best movie ever made to the best trilogy ever done. This movie deserved the eleven Oscars it got including the Editing. Without the editing, this movie would've been over four hours long. Even though this movie is about three and a half hours, it dies not feel like it. The scenes are intense and can tend to be emotional. Gollum is the show-stealer again. As the ring is taking Frodo away from strength, Gollum uses that to get the ring back eventually and drive Sam away. It was kind of sad to see Gollum die along with the Ring in the fires of Mt.Doom. Aragorn deserves to be king of Gondor. He was amazing in this movie(played by Viggo Mortensen). I am glad that Legolas and Gimli were used for comedy. With all the drama and action, there needs to be a bit of comedy before the action overwhelms the movie. The acting is perfect. I liked most of the characters. It was sad when Theoden died. He was great in this series. The music by Howard Shore is even better. You can hear some Celtic tunes during some scenes. I loved the song, 'Into The West' by Annie Lennox. The effects and the CGI is excellent especially during the battle scenes towards the end. Peter Jackson really put his name into the record books. This is the best fantasy epic, in fact the best movie of all time. I rate this movie 15/10(if the rating system went any higher).",10,7,11,10 November 2008
Munich," A Thrilling History Lesson!
","Munich is a very powerful film in all aspects. I am surprised that acclaimed director Steven Spielberg directed this film because he is Pro-Israel. If you are expecting a movie such as Jaws or E.T, you will be disappointed. This film is a thriller and a history lesson meant to tell the truth by Hollywood.This film is about the 1972 Munich Olympics games. Eleven Israeli hostages were murdered. Now, a team is sent out to kill the members who planned the Munich attacks. The leader of the team is Avner. He must leave his family and he is stricken with pains of war and death throughout this movie. All he wants to do is be home with his family.The cast was absolutely amazing. Eric Bana is powerful playing Avner. I liked Daniel Craig's character. There are other great actors out there whose names I cannot recall such as the guy who played Louis.The music is superb. John Williams can do any kind of music for any kind of movie genre. The music adds a more thrilling demeanor to this movie.The one thing I have against this is that this movie is a little long so that meant some scenes were a bit overdone. Not much, though.Overall, this is a fantastic film. It deserves the Best Picture nomination. I rate this movie 9/10.",9,2,3,8 February 2009
Pitch Perfect," Music For The Mind and Ears!
","Pitch Perfect happened to come out of nowhere by surprising people on how great this film actually is. I know people were not expecting much from the trailers, but this is a film that comes straight from the heart. I am not a fan of today's music, but I do like a cappella and there is some talent here. There are several top-tapping songs that you can sing and dance along with. The characters are surprisingly relatable and depending on what kind of person you are, there is someone here you can relate with.This film is about a girl named Beca who is starting college against her own will. She is recruited to a women's a cappella team, the Barden Bellas because of her singing talent. Now with her involved, it's up to them to win the national championship.This film has some solid acting. Anna Kendrick is really good in the lead role and I never thought of her as a good singer. Some noticeable stand-outs amongst the team is Brittany Snow as the mean-spirited Aubrey and Rebel Wilson as the funny Fat Amy.Overall, this happens to be a better, much better musical than expected. It may have a formulaic plot, but the fine performances and the abundance of comedy overcomes that issue. It's a funny and moving portrait of life in a modern college society. I rate this film 9/10.",9,0,2,20 March 2014
The Truman Show," Jim Carrey is.....Great!
","The Truman Show is Jim Carrey's best movie hands-down. Not only do we see his usual comedic talent, but we also see some surprising dramatic chops from him. The first few minutes, I had no idea what was going on in the movie but by the end, I was amazed. I never thought Jim Carrey would put on a performance as he displayed here in the Truman Show.Unlike most Carrey movies, this movie has an actual plot and a really original one, at least it was back in 1998. This film is about a guy, Truman who is being filmed in part of a 24-hour reality TV show. But, he just believes he is an ordinary guy living a normal life. As time goes on, he believes to suspect that not all is ordinary.As I mentioned before, Jim Carrey is very, very good. But also deserving praise is Ed Harris as the show's creator. He played his role so well, I had to ask myself if he is the good guy or the bad guy and that usually never happens.Overall, this is a masterful film directed by Peter Weir. Both Weir and Harris are deserving of their Oscar nods. I truly wish that Carrey received one as well. The film holds up well as we move along in the 21st century. The visual effects and the way the movie was filmed regarding the Florida landscape was really done well. My favorite scenes in the movie were when the wife was talking as if she was an advertiser, but Truman never notices. I always found that funny. This is a funny, charming, and moving film that shows Carrey with a different side to himself. I rate this film 9/10.",9,0,1,15 March 2013
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire," Katniss Catches the World on Fire!
","The Hunger Games: Catching Fire is an excellent sequel to the pleasantly surprising 2012 hit, the Hunger Games. The basic plot is the same, but the stakes are higher. The social commentary is pushed across better this time around under the sure-handed direction of Francis Lawrence, who also made the right decision to forgo the shaky camera routine. The production design remain a highlight of the series and same goes for the costumes and makeup. Effie's wardrobe is weird, but very colorful. The film, especially when we get to the Games, is action-packed and some of those sequences are just breath-taking. Finally, the ending of the movie is a toughie because it has the best cliffhanger in any movie I seen in recent memory.Francis Lawrence, who takes over the director title from Gary Ross, continues the adventure of Katniss. After winning the Hunger Games, Katniss and Peeta go on tour to the other districts, where people see them as a sign of hope and rebellion, much to the anger of President Snow. With the new gameskeeper Plutarch, the Capital decides to issue forth another set of Games, this time called the Quarter Quell with involves only previous Games winners. Once again, Katniss must rely on her wit, friends, and her bow in order to stay alive.Unlike many young-adult series, this film has perfect acting. Jennifer Lawrence is just amazing as Katniss. Josh Hutcherson is pretty good as Peeta, though he may be the weakest link. Donald Sutherland makes a very creepy and evil Snow. The late Philip Seymour Hoffman is a fantastic addition to the cast. Woody Harrelson, as usual, does wonders to give the film a few jokes. Elizabeth Banks is quite.....colorful as Effie. Finally, Jeffrey Wright and Jena Malone are two key additions to the cast because they are essential members needed for the Games.Overall, the sequel is bigger and better than the first film. This is one of the best cinematic franchises in recent history, and definitely the best young adult franchise since Harry Potter. It's rare for these kind of films to receive such critical support. It helps that I love these kind of dystopian films and it doesn't hurt when there is excellent acting and a huge production design to speak of. I also love that new Coldplay song, 'Atlas,' which is sung in the end credits. But that ending really has me itching for the Mockingjay films. The first film was excellent, but Catching Fire is beyond excellent. I rate this film 10/10.",10,3,15,6 January 2015
Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure," Way Better Than I Expected!
","I don't know how they did this, but Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure actually turned out to be a decent movie. There were some laughs to be had and the sci-fi is actually pretty darn crazy. In other words, this is a dumb film, but so dumb that it turns to be good entertainment. If you manage you turn off your brain and not expect anything serious, you will probably like this. (And no, there are no explosions here.) This film is about two doofus high school students named Bill and Ted who are on the verge of failing their history class, unless they pass their final oral exam. But with the help of this one mysterious figure, the duo use a time machine to head back in time to get their history for their project. But is it enough? Now, I wouldn't call the acting great. But everyone has just enough charm in order to make things work. Keanu Reeves in one of his very early film roles does an okay job and so does his mate, Alex Winter. I will say their characters are mildly irritating at times. There are also some cool cameos here, including the great George Carlin.Overall, this is a film that has no right to be good........but it is. It's an hour and a half of cheap entertainment that has some laughs and gives us a different look at time travel. Their take on the future is ludicrous, but pretty funny. This is not going to win any Oscars, but it's pure, dumb fun. I rate this film 8/10.",8,0,0,26 July 2014
The Matrix," What is the Matrix?
","What is the Matrix? Is it something like a machine that rules the planet? It took me awhile to understand the concept of this movie. Now that I grasped the big picture, I enjoyed this movie a lot more than I did the first time I saw this film. This film is about a illegal computer hacker, Neo who is wanted by a mysterious group led by the even more mysterious Morpheus and the cops. Morpheus shows Neo what the world is really like and who is in charge of the planet. Now Morpheus, Neo, and the rest of the group must evade these alien-like droids that appear as human. The fighting is great in this film. I am surprised that there is plenty of kung-fu fighting. The special effects were even better. They made this movie win a few Oscars. The acting is much better than I anticipated. Keanu Reeves deserves a medal for acting like an actor. I still need to watch this movie one more time to boost my rating up to a 10. Currently, I rate this movie 9/10.",9,1,2,22 November 2008
Godzilla," The Almighty Godzilla!
","At last, we have ourselves a terrifying monster movie that delves deep with a rich human story. After the mediocre 1998 Godzilla theatrical film, I never thought Godzilla would be brought justice on the big screen. But in 2014, this film came out and I am proud to say it is much better than the last Godzilla movie. The story is deeper, and there is more creature action to be had. I liked the design of Godzilla, even if it looks like he was injected with hyper steroids. I also thought the sound and Alexandre Desplat's score were also highlights of the film. Gareth Edwards's film is about this discovery which awakens these two carnivorous predators named 'MUTOS,' which in turns waken an ancient dinosaur named Godzilla. With millions of lives at stake, Godzilla must hunt down these MUTOS, as long as the United States Army does not get in his way. The film does boast an impressive cast. Aaron-Taylor Johnson does a good job in shedding his 'Kick-Ass' mask to play a responsible Marin, Ford up near the front lines fighting these monsters. Bryan Cranston does a great job as Ford's father, but sadly his role is limited. Ken Watanabe is a mixed bag. He is a great actor, but it seems his skills were not as sharp in this film. Also, David Strathairn made for an interesting army colonel, even if his character was clichéd. Overall, this Godzilla remake is much better than Roland Emmerich's version. This is truly a terrifying monster story that has the added bonus of a human story with is rich and engrossing. It could have been a straightforward disaster film, but luckily the film uses its story to add emotional depth. I had doubts when this movie was released, but those doubts have since vanished. Also worth noting is Godzilla is the main star of the show for a variety of reasons. My Grade: A",9,2,4,1 April 2015
Looper," Very Original Sci-Fi Film!
","Looper is one of the best original sci-fi films I have seen in years. It's a complicated film because it will bend your mind and is very conceptual. In short, you may have to use your brain here. This film has time travel as it's main point, but I like how the film makes new use of it. Over the course of the film, the plot may get complicated but wen all is said and done, everything gets straightened out.Rian Johnson's film takes place in the near future when time travel has been invented. In the year 2074, going through time has been banned except by the most ruthless criminal organizations. In 2044, there are people like Joe called 'loopers' who are tasked with executing people from the future. But when Joe's future self gets sent back for extermination, things may get a little hairy.Bruce Willis and Joseph Gordon-Levitt are very good as older and younger Joe. I thought Levitt does a good job impersonating the mannerisms of Willis and perhaps the use of prosthetics worked. Emily Blunt also manages to do well and adds emotion to her character.Overall, a high-concept movie, but a very good one at that. It has a tough screenplay but it is very smart and engaging. There is no shortage of action and this will keep you on your feet expecting more things to happen. I also liked the concept of telekinesis and it made the film a bit more interesting. A very solid sci-fi film. I rate this film 9/10.",9,0,4,16 March 2014
Casino," A Scorcese Classic!
","Martin Scorcese really knows how to make movies. Every one of his movies are just well-done classics worth watching over and over again. Casino is no exception. I'm kind of surprised that no one seems to have seen this movie. I guess it's just overshadowed by other Scorcese's films with greater hype such as Goodfellas or Taxi Driver.This movie is almost a sequel to Goodfellas. It goes much more in depth in the lives of the gangsters more than the fore-mentioned movie did. This is about how the mafia placed a guy in charge of running a casino. This guy wants no unnecessary problems, but unfortunately that happens in the way of his new wife.The acting is very good. Robert de Niro is one of the greatest actors of all time. Joe Pesci is great as the cursing, ugly slimeball. The only weak link is Sharon Stone. I'm not a big fan of hers.The voice-over narration in the movie works. That kept me hooked throughout. Also this is one of the most violent movies ever and that is also good.Overall, this is a fine depiction of the mafia. Despite it's length, I would see it over and over again. I rate this film 9/10.",9,2,3,20 July 2011
Heat," Amazing!
","This is one of those great movies of the 90's that featured a main theme of cops and robbers. Despite the many clichés, this sort of plot never gets old especially when the greats Al Pacino and Robert de Niro in the roles of cops and robbers respectively. This movie also reminded me of the action movies from the 80's. It kind of has a 80's feel to it.This is about a group of detectives who go full out after Neil and his gang. As I mentioned before, the plot has been used before. But who cares, this movie is wildly entertaining.The acting was amazing. This movie has an all-star cast ranging from the aging De Niro and Pacino to the very young, talented Natalie Portman.Some scenes in the movie are shocking. I think the aftermath of the bank robbery scene has to be one of the greatest in the history of action cinema.Overall, this is a crazy crime film. This movie features two great veteran actors at their best. I rate this film 9/10.",9,0,1,29 November 2010
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," Pretty Good!
","I think this movie is pretty good but I also think it's somewhat overrated. I did not think it was good as some people claim it to be. I'm sure this was a masterpiece in 1977 but in today's day and age in film making, this is just an ordinary science fiction movie. This movie is better than the first prequel though.This movie focuses on Luke and Leia and the rest of the rebellion as they try to defeat Darth Vader and the Empire. Also Luke and Obi-Wan befriends the cocky Han Solo, the navigator of the Millennium Falcon.The acting is pretty good. Mark Hamill and Carrie Fisher were solid. Of course I recognized the voice of James Earl Jones. Sir Alec Guinness is on par with Ewan McGregor from the prequels.The droids once again provided some humor. The special effects were not that good compared to the standards of today. I loved the themes by John Williams.Overall, this is a pretty good movie though not the best in the Star Wars series. I rate this film 8/10.",8,0,0,17 December 2010
Footloose," Is This Remake Necessary?
","The remake of the 1984 classic Footloose is not a bad movie and is actually quite fun at times, but was it necessary to remake a movie that doesn't need a remake? I mean both of these movies are very similar to each other with the exception of some very minor plot changes. The music is good to listen to as always since the Kenny Loggins hit song is still a classic. I won't lie that I had the itch to get up and dance a few times. But quality-wise, it's on par with the original and possibly maybe a little less.Craig Brewer's film is about a guy named Ren who moves to a Tennessee town and finds out dancing is illegal because of a fatal accident. He falls in love with the preacher's daughter and Ren decides to do all he can to bring dancing and rock'n'roll back in town.The acting isn't really that bad. Kenny Wormald is a decent choice to play Ren but obviously no one will beat Kevin Bacon. Julianne Hough is also decent as the preacher's daughter and Dennis Quaid makes a tough minister.Overall, this is a good film but as it's almost the same as the original even when it comes to dialogue, I can't help feeling I'm actually reviewing the original. This has some good songs and people of today's generation will probably like this more than those who grew up with the original. I rate this film 7/10.",7,4,10,8 May 2013
50_50," Quite Funny and Moving!
","50/50 is probably the only movie I have ever seen that took a very serious topic such as cancer and turned it into a comedy or I should say dramedy. It works because there is a nice balance between laugh-out-loud comedy and very sad, serious moments. I laughed incredibly hard in some scenes and even shed a few tears in others. I liked the tone of the film because it has that off-beat, quirky, non-mainstream feeling to it.Jonathan Levine's film is about a 27-year-old guy who is diagnosed with a rare form of spinal cancer. Because of his disease, he truly finds out what kind of person he is thanks to all of his family and friends supporting him such as his wise-cracking friend, over-concerned mother, and his shy, quirky therapist.Joseph Gordon-Levitt certainly has his acting chops on hand. He proves he can still star in indie films such as this after appearing in big blockbusters like he did with Inception. He brought a certain charm to his role. I was surprised to see Seth Rogen in a movie like this. This is probably his best role he played to date. Anjelica Huston goes over-the-top as the freaked-out mother. Anna Kendrick is just the right person to play the therapist with her quirky personality.Overall, this is a very good film that brings out the lighter side of the disease. It has a central theme that suggests people to be optimistic in times of disease and peril. I'm glad they didn't make a very serious movie or I'll be shedding tears nonstop. Jonathan Levine has a great career ahead of him after this movie. I rate this film 9/10.",9,3,4,27 April 2013
Hart's War," Unrealistic....But Hey, It's Hollywood!
","If you like action and Bruce Willis, this is the movie for you. If you like history and you expect something similar to 'Saving Private Ryan', you will be disappointed. I am choosing to review this with 'Hollywood' in mind.This film takes place in the German POW camps. The main focus are the American prisoners led by Bruce Willis and Colin Farrell. The camp is running fine with the exception of Nazis guarding them. The status quo is changed when two black men arrived at camp.The acting is pretty good. Bruce Willis and Colin Farrell did an excellent job. Marcel Iures literally creeps you out as the Nazi leader of the camp.Now, this movie is unrealistic. I don't believe that the Nazis would allow the Americans to live in peace or comfort and diss Hitler as they did in this movie.Overall, this is a good movie. I have seen better war movies, but this movie is not designed to win an Oscar. I rate this movie 8/10.",8,0,2,11 March 2009
Cloud Atlas," At Last.......2012's Most Ambitious Film!
","Before delving into my review of the film, I must say there need to be more movies made like Cloud Atlas. There need to be more intelligent and thought-provoking films being made. That being said, this is a film that's hardly seen on-screen, and the box office failure is evident of that. But one can respect the grand, ambitious project the Wachowski's siblings made. Despite losing what exactly was going on at times, I kept on getting more and more involved in the film. I loved the scope and style of it as well as the themes being conveyed.The Wachowski Siblings directed a film that has many things going on. It's essentially a story that weaves together the past, present, and future and how each event is somehow connected with each other. That being said, there is no use trying to describe the plot. But there are religious themes at play here, especially when it comes to reincarnation.The acting in this film is brilliant and everyone is on top of their game. Tom Hanks did a wonderful job and shows off a wide range of acting skills. Halle Berry, who I generally dislike, managed to impress me. Jim Broadbent is amazing and pulled off some extraordinary skills. Hugo Weaving is just good at being a bad guy. Jim Sturgess was very good as well. Everyone pulled off a great feat of playing multiple characters very well in this film.Overall, this is probably the most ambitious film ever made. I'm sad to see how it failed at the box office. But this one story that is told very well on the big screen and it's backed up by a grand scope, impressive visuals, superb acting, and impressive directing. I can see why this film would be so decisive, but it shouldn't be. An amazing film with open-minded concepts. I rate this film 9/10.",9,5,7,22 April 2014
300," A Moving Epic!
","I rally liked 300. I should have seen this film when it came out in theaters. Almost 2 years later that I finally got the chance to see it. There is no need to describe the plot unless you did not pay attention in your history class. It's about 300 Spartan soldiers led by King Leonidas taking on King Xerxes and his 100,000 soldiers. It is no mystery what happens to the Spartans. I liked this move very much. The style of filming is much different than I am used to seeing. The tone is dark and there is basically war scenes with little romance along the side. The story is moving because the 300 men died for their country, died to stop the Persians from invading Sparta and having their loved ones used as slaves. The acting is great. I don't expect much out of Gerard Butler but he did awesome in this movie. This film is very gory and blood is seen many times so if you don't like blood, beware. I rate this movie 10/10.",10,8,12,29 November 2008
Tarzan," Entertaining and Fast-Paced!
","In the 1990's, Disney came out with a bunch of classic animated films that pushed the boundary of animated films at the time such as Hunchback of Notre Dame and The Lion King and they also came out with Pixar which had Toy Story and A Bug's Life. The final year of that decade, they released this film, Tarzan. This film reminds me of Disney classics of old. It's a fun, entertaining film that is crisply animated and has a good story.Based off the creation of Edgar Burrough Rice, this film is about a kid who was shipwrecked with his family and is orphaned after his parents were killed by Sabor, a vicious leopard. He is taken in by a herd of gorillas if somewhat reluctantly. Years later, another group of humans come into the area and Tarzan meets Jane and that's where he finds out there are more just like him.This film has a good voice cast. There is some good talent here such as Glenn Close, Brian Blessed, Minnie Driver, and even Lance Henricksen.Overall, this is a very entertaining Disney film. Despite the fact that this film is rated G, adults will like this film even more than the younger ones since it has some mature themes. Another plus is this movie has a very powerful soundtrack thanks to the excellent talent of Phil Collins. This is not the best Disney film, but it's still quite magnificent. I rate this film 9/10.",9,1,2,14 July 2013
The Hangover Part III," Should Have Been Better!
","The third and final installment in the Hangover franchise has to be looked at as a slight disappointment. Due to the lack of a positive critical response for the last film, director Todd Phillips decided to change the formula. I think that may have been a mistake, because I loved the first two films because they were incredibly hilarious. While there are some funny scenes in this film, this is more action-packed and the jokes are far and between. It was nice to see everyone back and while the film is entertaining at times, it doesn't live up to the first two films.Phillip's film has the Wolfpack returning for one more adventure. Alan is suffering from a mental crisis and the rest of the crew decide to get him help. While on the road, they are taken by a crime lord named Marshall who is punishing the crew from the events of the first film. Now they must capture an escaped Chow or else one of their own will be killed.The acting is pretty good, depending on who you look at. Bradley Cooper and Ed Helms continue being great as their respective characters of Phil and Stu. Zack Galifinakis is beginning to be annoying at times. He is funny at certain points, but his antics are growing old. The same can be said for Ken Jeong. Funny during some points, annoying in others. John Goodman makes a great villain, but he could have used more screen-time. Also, Melissa McCarthy makes a small cameo and she was pretty funny.Overall, the Hangover Three is not a bad film, but it lacks in comedy and real depth compared to the first two. People complained about the same formula, but I really liked it and it would have been a lot funnier that way. Some of the noticeably funny scenes involved a giraffe and I'll give them credit for that. It's a good movie at times, but it's certainly mediocre for the rest. I rate this film 6.5/10.",7,0,0,12 September 2014
Easy A," Funny and Sweet!
","Easy A is a very funny and touching movie that pays homage to the John Hughes teen movies of the 1980's. Even during the film, we are treated to a montage of clips from various Hughes films. This is also a movie that many of us can relate to whether we are young or old. This is one of the reasons I love this film. I can relate to this film back from my days in high school.This film is about a girl who has no reputation and no one notices her. But that changes when sexual rumors spread about her. Now, she decides take her newfound popularity to her advantage.This is the film that made Emma Stone a star. She was a great scene stealer in both Zombieland and Superbad, but she comes into her own here. I also loved the parents played by Stanley Tucci and Patricia Clarkson. They are hilarious and lovable but dim-witted. I also give credit to Amanda Bynes and her religious cult. That was pretty funny.Overall, this is a hilarious but relatable teen comedy. I bet no one would have thought that the critics would love this and do quite well at the box office. I was one of the doubters but now I'm a believer. This is one of the best teen films of the decade if not century(2000's). I rate this film 9/10.",9,2,3,3 January 2013
Apollo 13," This movie was well-made!
","This movie was well-done and Oscar-worthy. Apollo 13 was based on a true incident that happened in 1970. According to my family, this movie depicted the actual events very well. It is about a three-man crew who went up in space to visit the moon. They never made it to the moon. Just about everything in the ship blew up and caused problems. They eventually made it safe home. I thought the acting and directing was great. Ron Howard really knew what he was doing. Tom Hanks and Ed Harris leads a Oscar-worthy cast that can be found in very few other movies. I thought that the score fitted well with the movie. The script was good and so was everything else. If you have not seen this film, you had better see this film. I loved this movie so I give it a 9/10.",9,2,3,6 December 2007
Fast Five," By Far the Franchise's Best!
","The Fast and the Furious franchise is not the best franchise out there but the first four films were just fun, over-the-top movies that doesn't need a plot. I didn't know that there could be any masterpieces in this series, then Fast Five came along. What we got here is more fun, absurd action, impossible stunts, returning characters from past films, and yes, emotion.Justin Lin's film takes place right after Fast & Furious ended, with Brian and Mia rescuing Dom Toretto from life imprisonment. After that, they travel to Rio de Janeiro where they plan to lay low. But they soon figure to do one last deal before they retire. They bring in old friends to help them do the cash grab of a lifetime. But, Luke Hobbs, a beefed-up cop on a mission is the one who plans on bringing the gang down.Vin Diesel and Paul Walker have great chemistry in this film. Woking together for three films will do this to actors. I loved that many of the old faces such as Tyrese Gibson, Sung Kang, Ludicrous, and Matt Schulze have returned. Jordana Brewster is still looking good after all these years.Overall, this is one heck of a ride. What makes this film work is that instead of a racing cars film, we have a heist film. This follows in the footsteps of the Ocean's trilogy and it works. I loved all these stunts. They get better as each movie progresses. I don't know how they did this, but I really liked that preposterous scene where Vin and Paul jumped out of a car while it drives off a cliff. That was just incredible. This is definitely the best in the series and I'm excited for the sixth installment. I rate this film 10/10.",10,1,2,4 February 2013
The Thin Red Line," A Masterpiece!
","I am surprised that not many people saw this because it was nominated for seven Oscars. I guess people tend to ignore this film because it came out the same year as Saving Private Ryan. I would see both of them because they both are unique in their own ways. Now that I look back, I wonder how Shakespeare in Love could beat this film.This is about the battle of Guadalcanal during the second world war and the terrible things about war and the strength of bonding with one another.The acting is very good. I knew like everybody in the film. Sean Penn is the best though. He has really powerful dialogue.This isn't the action film most people think it is. It's more of a drama that requires people to think.The cinematography is very good. I love the score by Hans Zimmer too.Overall, this is one of the best war movies ever. It could be a few minutes shorter though. I rate this film 9/10.",9,2,4,1 February 2011
Fantastic Four," What a Fantastic Movie!
","Fantastic Four is one of the better superhero movies of all time. Everything is nearly perfect, if not perfect. This film centers around four people and one villain who's been hit by a radioactive storm. They discover that they have superpowers because of the storm. Now they have to deal with the media and the public, discover how to be normal again, and defeat the evil Victor Von Doom. I think that the acting is fantastic. Michael Chiklis, Jessica Alba, Ioan Gruffudd, and Chris Evans were awesome. I liked Evans the best because he is arrogant, funny, and snobby. The special effects were great. The script was very decent. I liked the music in this film. I recommend this to people over 8. I rate this film a 10/10.",10,3,5,17 May 2008
The Twilight Saga: Eclipse," Better Than New Moon!
","Eclipse is definitely better than New Moon. There is more action and the love story becomes more intense. Also, this movie stayed true to the novel. It also sets up the stage for a really great finale to the series.This is pretty much a battle between Jacob and Edward to see who gets Bella. Also things look bad when the Cullens discover that there is a vampire army being bred.The acting is not bad at all. Stewart and Pattinson aren't that impressive but they aren't horrible. Billy Burke and Dakota Fanning shine in their roles.The CGI is pretty good especially when it came to the wolves. The music by Howard Shore is also pretty good.Overall, this is a good installment to the Twilight franchise. I do hope the last two are much better. I rate this film 8/10.",8,0,6,20 February 2011
Click," Best Sandler Movie!
","In Click, we see the same old Sandler, but a different Sandler as well. Even though it's different, it's just fabulous. It's like watching a funny comedy, then it goes to a serious but nice drama, then it goes back to typical Sandler comedy. I liked it this way. This film is about a man who gets a remote from a wacko working in the Beyond section in Bed, Bath, Beyond store. He uses the remote for his pleasure, but deadly consequences soon begin to appear. The script was written well and it surprises me because the the script is based on a joke. Amazing! I was laughing through the movie. The 'dog-humping' thing was really funny. The acting was great. Besides Sandler, Kate Beckinsale, Christopher Walken, David Hasselhoff, and even Sean Astin were great at their roles. This film is a bit crude, though. I recommend this to all people age 10 and up. I rate this film a 10/10.",10,2,4,22 December 2007
Pineapple Express," Good Movie!
","This is pretty much what I expected. I didn't expect too much out of this film because it didn't appeal to me like Knocked Up or Superbad did. Seth Rogen and James Franco are perhaps the funniest people of the movie. Most of their scenes were hilarious. Sometimes though, I couldn't follow the plot. I was a little confused.This movie is about two stoners who have an obsession for very rare marijuana. But also they love to be chased by bad guys as they do in the movie.Overall, this has plenty of comedy and action. But, I would see Knocked Up or Superbad before this one. I rate this film 7/10.",7,4,9,12 July 2010
Interview with the Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles," Pretty Good Vampire Movie!
","The reason I saw this movie is because two great actors star opposite each other in this film. They are the great Brad Pitt and Tom Cruise. They were nothing short of spectacular in this movie. I don't know why they won a Razzie award. The other aspects of the movie are good, just ordinary.Louis tells a story in 1991 about how he became vampire back in 1791 and his life between then and 1991. He talks about the vampire, Lestat who blooded him and a bond he made between a young girl named Claudia.Tom Cruise is magnificent as the evil vampire who blooded Louis. His character is very surprising in this movie.The set design is probably the second best thing about the film. The tone is for the most part eerie. Overall, this is a good movie that would be great to play on Halloween. I rate this film 8/10.",8,0,0,22 June 2010
Jackie Brown," Brilliant Tarantino!
","I have never seen a Quentin Taratino movie that I have yet hated. All his movies are filled with witty dialog, a great cast, and a well-written script. That is no exception for this movie, Jackie Brown. This wonderful film is actually one of his underrated films. When people talk Quentin, they always talk about Pulp Fiction or Inglourious Basterds never this film. This is a gritty crime film that is actually worth watching just for the dialog alone.Jackie Brown is about how six different people could end up with a lot of money if they are the first to get it. We have a shady gun salesman, a lonely jail bond guy, a no-nonsense airline clerk, a coke-happy girl, an honest cop, and another shady guy just released from jail after serving time for bank robbery.What is always good about Quentin is that he knows how to cast his movies. That proves to be no exception here. I just loved the main cast and their personalities. If I had to choose, I would have picked Samuel L. Jackson as my favorite character in this film. I'm happy to say that this film also resurrected Pam Grier's career and got Robert Forster recognized by the Academy.Overall, this is almost the perfect Quentin film. It has the well-written dialog and the great chemistry between the actors. This film reminded me of Pulp Fiction style-wise, but it has a whole new tone to it. I rate this film 9/10.",9,0,0,14 February 2013
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," Better Than Episode IV!
","This movie is a little better than Episode 4 but sill it's just an ordinary science fiction film. It wasn't until Return of the Jedi when some really good science fiction kicks in. There were many good moments in this film with Han Solo and the return of my favorite character, Yoda.This is about how the Empire scattered the rebels and how Vader is obsessed over Luke Skywalker.The acting is pretty good. Harrison Ford made Han Solo a great character. He added humor to this guy.The lightsaber duel between Anakin and Luke is a good one. Also one of the most famous movie quote comes from that scene.The music by Williams once again a beauty. The recently deceased Irvin Kershner directed a pretty good movie. The special effects are somewhat better than the first. I rate this film 8/10.",9,0,2,17 December 2010
Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted," Wildly Entertaining Three-quel!
","To be honest, the third addition to the Madagascar series didn't do me justice after DreamWorks released the trailers. But being a fan of the series on a whole, I decided to check this film out. It turned out there's nothing to worry about because this film was just as entertaining as the first two films and is delightfully funny. There are some wonderful new characters here such as Vitaly and that evil animal control woman. The animation itself is beautiful and more sharper.Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted has Alex and the crew still stuck in Africa. While trying to find the penguins, they crash a party in Monte Carlo attracting the attention of the animal control lady and her posse. Now in order to escape their clutches, they join a circus in hopes for them to get back to America.Our favorite voice cast returns for the sequel and still provide exceptional voicework. We here Ben Stiller, Chris Rock, Jada Pinkett Smith, and Sacha Baren Cohen. There are some new voices her that do swell such as Frances McDormand and Bryan Cranston.Overall, this is a very good three-quell and it's a worthy addition into the series. Like the previous two, it's a bit silly. But if you like them, you should like this. Kids will definitely be entertained here and so will adults. I know I was entertained because it has an interesting story and lots of laughs. I rate this film 9/10.",9,1,2,3 January 2014
Sin City," Excellent Style!
","Sin City is one of those rare films from the film noir genre that I seen. This movie certainly impressed with me with its unique style. The whole film was shot in black and white with the exception of a few colors here or there. Also, this movie is very violent. The violence reminds me of the Kill Bill movies.This movie basically tells the story of three hit men who are thirsty for righteousness in a way but in order to get that, they do nothing but kill.The cast is impressive. There are many stars such as the great Bruce Willis and Mickey Rourke. Jessica Alba looks hot as she usually does.Now this movie is not for kids. There is plenty of death and prostitution here. But I like it one these kind of movies come out once in a while. They usually have great visuals like this film.Overall, this is a great though violent film. I rate this film 9/10.",9,4,5,1 December 2010
Gangs of New York," Good, But Somewhat Overrated!
","When this movie first came out, it looked like a promising film. It took me awhile to finally watch it. Whilst this movie is great, it does not deserve to be nominated for Best Picture. It simply was not that good, but it was good enough for me to be satisfied.This film is takes place in New York City before and during the Civil War years. Young Amsterdam just witnessed his father being murdered in a gang war. Sixteen years later, he vows revenge.The acting is great for the most part. Leonardo DiCaprio impresses me no matter what movie he's in. Daniel-Day Lewis is another great actor with great skill and he showed it in this movie.Some people found this film moving and disturbing. That is because this movie accurately shows what the Five Points of New York was like and why they hated the Irish immigrants.The score in this film is decent, not great. The U2 song is very good, though.Overall, Martin Scorcese did a great job even though he might be losing it a bit. I rate this movie 8/10.",8,0,0,20 March 2009
Windtalkers," Has Its Moments!
","Windtalkers is a war movie and one that some people may not have heard of. It's a mediocre war movie to say at best, but it does have its moments. There is a question of authenticity related to the movie. The story itself may be factual, but the movie's interpretation of the story is questionable. However, there are some redeemable qualities such as the fine acting, a good amount of action, and a solid score by composer James Horner.John Woo's film is about two U.S Marines named Ben Yahzee and Peter Anderson who are assigned to protect several Navajo codebreakers from falling into the Japanese hands.I did like the acting of the film. Nic Cage does a great job in the center role and he shows great chemistry with Adam Beach, the actor who played his Navajo Marine. Christian Slater does a good job as Anderson, and I also liked the performances of Mark Ruffalo and Noah Emmerich.Overall, Windtalkers is a war movie that is driven on a clichéd story. Some people may like the film, while others may despise it. I am stuck in the middle. I liked many aspects of the film, but other aspects were just doomed to failure such as the story and authenticity. But I will give the movie points in part due to Nic Cage's powerful performance. A loud, bloody, war movie is a good way to describe the movie.My Grade: C-",7,5,6,30 April 2015
Braveheart," Excellent Film!
","I never saw this movie until September 2007. I should've seen this when it first came out. This is a masterpiece that deserves to be on the IMDb Top 250 and 5 Oscars. This film is about a Scottish guy named William Wallace and he wants to be free from England. This film was directed by Mel Gibsonn and Wallace was played by Gibson, as well. Gibson did a superb job doing both things at once. I liked the acting in this film because it seemed so realistic. I also liked the score. I believe that it resembles Scottish music. People may not like this film because it is not historically accurate. So, that is true, but this film is basically for mere entertainment. I loved this film and I am sure may others do. I recommend this movie for everyone. I rate this movie a 9/10.",9,3,6,8 December 2007
Coach Carter," Rises Above the Clichés!
","Coach Carter is a very formulaic sports film that follows every rule in the rulebook for sports film. However, thanks to a very centralized, high-powered performance by Samuel L. Jackson, this film is able to stand on its own two feet. There are some emotional moments when you are rooting for the underdog, in this case the Richmond Oilers, to win it all. This film also showcases the tough time people have growing up in poor areas and the broken-down American education system.Thomas Carter's film is about a legendary basketball player named Ken Carter who goes back to his old high school to coach a number of violent, uneducated people the true game of basketball and how the game will change their attitudes, and more importantly their lives.Samuel L. Jackson does one heck of a job in his role. Thanks to his inspiring performance, this movie is worth watching. He is passionate about this role and despite acting as a bully to his players, you feel for him since you know that he cares for his players and will do anything to give them a better life and go to college.Overall, this is an above-average sports film thanks to Jackson. Even without him, this film would have been good despite having almost every cliché in the book. But hey, this is quality filmmaking. I was able to enjoy the drama and all the games. I liked how they went from the bad news bears of basketball to playing like champions. I rate this film 9/10.",9,0,0,13 August 2013
Happy Feet," A Good Animated Film!
","Happy Feet is a pretty good film. I enjoyed this movie then I thought I would. I was skeptical at first about this film. Happy Feet basically tells the story of dancing/singing penguins during harsh times with little or no fish. The main character of the film is Mumble. We get to see him as a baby and an adult. He is the only penguin that can dance because his father dropped his egg. The acting was good for the most part. Robin Williams as the Latin penguins is absolutely hilarious. The music was good for the most part, but some songs could've been chosen better. Also I think that some of the actors need to take singing lessons. Overall, this is a great children film. I rate this film a 8/10.",8,1,2,18 June 2008
Her," A Weird Oddball Movie!
","Her probably receives my vote as the weirdest film of 2013. It also would receive the most delightfully enjoyable film of 2013. The tone is weird and same about the basic plot premise, which is essentially falling in love with a computer. Talk about unlikely romances! But I'll be darned if I said I did not enjoy myself while watching this little oddball movie. It's a gentle and sweet film and it has Joaquin Phoenix showing his more gentle side. The screenplay, written by Spike Jonze, also was one of the best original screenplays of the year. Jonze's film is about a man named Theodore who is going through a bitter divorce. He purchases an operating system designed to meet his everyday needs. But things get complicated when he realizes his machine, Samantha is more than a computer. He also begins to develops feelings for his machines, romantic feelings. Joaquin Phoenix was excellent in this movie. He showed a more mature, more softer side of his personality. But he was still a force to be reckoned with. Even better was Scarlett Johannson, who never appeared on screen. Her voice matched the tones of the romance that was beginning to occur. We also get smaller performances, but good ones from the likes of Amy Adams and Rooney Mara. Overall, Her might be one of the weirdest movies you might ever see. But it was made expertly which resulted in one of the better 2013 films. The screenplay and the acting are the best things about the movie. But this unlikely romance strikes a realistic tone, which actually made us believe this sort of romance could actually happen. The movie did provide me with some deep thinking, which makes me grateful for the extra brainpower. I rate this film 9/10.",9,2,4,1 February 2015
Slumdog Millionaire," Powerful!
","This is one of those films that I overlooked cause I did not expect much of it from viewing the trailer. But after I saw this, I was moved about the film. This is the best film rivaling the Dark Knight from 2008. The performances and direction are amazing. The score and songs from the newcomer Rahman is excellent. The song, 'Jai Ho' is stuck in my head.This is about some teen from the slums who amazes everybody when he does better than expected on 'Who Wants to be A Millionaire.' The acting is amazing. I think Dev Patel and Freida Pinto will have great Hollywood careers. Danny Boyle proves again he is a masterful director.Originally, I thought this movie ripped off the Dark Knight. I thought there was no way this could compete against that. Well, it deserved some of the Oscars it received. I rate this film 10/10.",10,1,4,2 December 2010
The Breakfast Club," Good Film for Teens!
","The Breakfast Club is a very good teen film but is it a classic as most people make it out to be? I do not think so. All what happens in this film is people talking to each other. That, in my opinion, does not make this an instant classic. However, this movie is amusing for the most parts. The dialog is very addictive despite that is what all there is.This film is about five teenagers who have Saturday detention. They use this detention time to open up and bond with each other.The acting is pretty solid. I really like Judd Nelson as John Bender. He provides lots of the fun of this movie. I also liked the late Paul Gleason as the principal. He is really funny in this movie.Overall, this is a good film that explores the inner dimensions of a teenager. John Hughes directed a good if somewhat talkative film. I rate this film 8/10",8,1,2,23 July 2012
Gladiator," The 'Real' Epic Movie!
","Has anyone reading this comment seen the movie 'Epic Movie'? Do you think that 'Epic Movie' is the best 'epic' out there? No, it's not even an epic at all. Gladiator is a true definition of what an epic movie is about. There is action, romance, and surprises. They all add up to the word 'epic.' This film is about a general of the Roman Empire who was wrongfully arrested over the murder of the emperor, taken as a slave, and turned into on the best Roman gladiators ever. While he is out there in the Coliseum, he has to deal with the evil son of the murdered emperor. The acting is very good. Russell Crowe did a great job and I was impressed on Joaquin Phoenix's acting. Ridley Scott always had the ability, as a director, to make Oscar-worthy movies. I also give thumbs-ups to Hans Zimmer. He composed many great movies with Gladiator being amongst them. This movie was nominated for a grand total of a whopping 12 Oscars and won 5 of them including Best Picture. On a minus side, this movie has slow parts basically involving Commodus. Other than that, this movie is close to perfect. I rate this movie 9/10.",9,2,3,6 December 2008
Contact," Great Performance By Jodie Foster!
","Robert Zemeckis's Contact is actually a better film than I expected. For some reason, I was expecting this film to be a romance film with sci-fi elements added. Thankfully, this film turned out more to be an emotional drama with heartfelt performances and a chance to ask the viewer, 'can this be real?' This film reminded me of Close Encounters of a Third Kind and in a good way. These films have positive messages on the outlook of what happens if aliens visited Earth.This film is about a very smart scientist who finally makes contact with a civilization not of this world. After dealing with skepticism, she finally convinces the world that all this is real. Tha aliens sends plans for the world to build a complex machine. What happens next? This movie features an all-star cast led by a powerful performance of Jodie Foster. I thought Matthew McConaughey was over-publicized because he wasn't in this film as much as I thought he would be but he still was pretty good. The supporting cast is one of the better supporting casts you would want to see in a film.Overall, this is a really good, thought-provoking sci-fi film. It has great visuals and they brought me to a sense of awe and wonder and truly made me think about if any other life exists and the ongoing battle between science and religion. For a film that came out in 1997, this hold up well for the year 2013. I rate this film 9/10.",9,1,3,13 February 2013
Pocahontas," Another Creative Disney Effort!
","We all know that the 1990's were home to the Disney Renaissance, in other words a return to form for Disney Animation. This film, Pocahontas is one of those films. But I view this film as the weakest of the bunch. It's not bad or anything, but I am very historically-minded and the historical inaccuracies just couldn't be so obvious as it was distracting at times. That being said, there is plenty to adore about this film. The songs, composed by Alan Menken, are incredible especially that song, 'Colors of the Wind.' The animation is lavish and it provides some beautiful sights in the Virginia Territory.This film tells the tale of Pocahontas and Captain John Smith and the romance that sprung up between two cultures, thus creating a clash. The English, led by Governor Ratcliffe, are bound for the New World in order to find gold. The Indians, led by Powhatan, has Pocahontas being married off to the greatest warrior of the village, but she believes she has a different path to follow.This film does have a solid voice cast. Mel Gibson does fine voice work as John Smith and I am very surprised he has a singing ability. The unknown Irene Bedard does a decent job as the titular character herself. We also get good supporting voice acting from the likes of Christian Bale and David Ogden Stiers.Overall, Pocahontas is a good movie with beautiful animation and wonderful music. But I am usually the one of the few that can overlook historical inaccuracy, but not this time due to it being blatantly obvious. Despite being on the B-tier of Disney movies, this film does manage to inspire and tell a tale of a forbidden romance. The film can be pretty funny at times thanks to the shenanigans of the raccoon and the Governor's dog. All-in-all, not a bad movie. Don't expect this film to be like the Little Mermaid. I rate this film 8/10.",8,1,2,5 January 2015
Transformers: Dark of the Moon," Like the First Two, You'll Like This!
","Transformers: Dark of the Moon is the third installment in the highly-lucrative franchise. Regarding whether this film is any good or not, my title for this post says it all. This movie is very similar to the first two films except the visuals and effects are even more over-the-top which I didn't know they could do. I happened to like this film because this is my kind of movie. I enjoyed the two and a half hours of explosions and more battles between the Autobots and Decepticons.In this film, Sam Witwicky returns as the hero who saved the world except he can't find a job. He has a girlfriend that is not Megan Fox. He gets caught up in these robot fights again when the Autobots are betrayed by one of their own and the Decepticons are intent on destroying Earth by moving Cybertron, their home world to Earth.The acting is pretty good with one exception. Shia LaBeouf is pretty good because you know what to expect out of him. John Turturro is solid and as usual, brings more comedy to the film. I liked the additions of Frances McDormand and John Malkovich's charm because they are two wonderful actors. I didn't like the new chick because she just seemed phony and pathetic. I wish they brought back Megan Fox because she can act a little bit.Overall, this is a film with impressive visual effects even thought it sort of lacks a plot. I didn't mind that because I wanted to see cool fights and extreme visuals. That is exactly what I got. I love these kind of movies because they are perfect examples of summer popcorn films. I don't know how they did the visual effects for the last hour of the film, but they were impressive. I rate this film 8/10.",8,5,8,28 February 2013
Born on the Fourth of July," American Patriotism!
","Oliver Stone's Born on the Fourth of July may be his best movie he has ever directed. This film is all about one American fighting against the injustice created by his American government in the Vietnam War. I like these kind of movies because whether or not the main characters are against their government, they still show American pride. This is a well-directed movie and is also one of Tom Cruise's finest acting roles to date.This film is based off a true story based around a Vietnam veteran named Ron Kovic. After Kovic is paralyzed from the neck down in combat, he decides to challenge his government and tell the country his true story.Tom Cruise is very effective as Kovic. It's hard picturing Cruise as a young man, but this is his finest role of the 80's and maybe his career. Honestly, I couldn't stand Kyra Sedgwick and that's my only complaint. She's not a great actress and really not that good-looking either.Overall, this is a very good film about the dangers of American patriotism. I really loved how Kovic's family played a central role in the film and that makes it even more moving. The movie also boasts another great score by legendary composer, John Williams. This is not the best movie based off the Vietnam War, but it only trails The Deer Hunter and Platoon in that department. This is a solid effort by Oliver Stone and people should check this out. I rate this film 9/10.",9,0,2,21 June 2013
The Social Network," Mesmerizing!
","The Social Network is worth all the hype. I expect it to do well at the Oscars. Even though the movie is all dialog, it sucks you in because the screenplay is well written by Aaron Sorkin. I liked this film a lot cause I can relate to some of the characters and of course I have my own facebook page.This movie is pretty much about the creation of Facebook and the people behind it.The acting is very good especially by Jesse Eisenberg and Andrew Garfield. Justin Timberlake isn't bad as most people expect him to be. The newcomer Rooney Mara captures you in the few scenes she has.Overall, this is a perfect drama. This should win at the Oscars. I hope it does. I rate this film 10/10.",10,1,2,15 January 2011
The Wedding Singer," Actually Heart-warming!
","The Wedding Singer is very good comedy with a blend of romantic elements. I never expected the movie to be as good as it is because of exactly that. However, this was the only Adam Sandler movie I haven't seen at this point so I gave it a try. I was very impressed.This is about a guy named Robbie Hart who is a successful wedding singer. Things turn for the worst when his wife leaves him at his own wedding. He becomes a depressed person and is on the verge of losing his job. Then he becomes best friends with a waitress. Will they fall in love? Even though Sandler is his usual typical self, he shows a heart-warming side of him. He shows some dramatic acting skills for the first time. Drew Barrymore is just fantastic as the waitress. The rest of the supporting actors were great as well.Overall, this is a funny, heart-warming film for all. This may be Adam's best movie. I rate this film 9/10.",9,1,1,31 August 2011
The Pursuit of Happyness," Good Drama!
","In his career, Will Smith has done two types of movie genres: action or drama. I tend to stay away from his dramas because I love his action movies so much I don't want to see him look bad in a drama. But, I finally saw this because I heard such good things since it came out. It turns out Will Smith can act in a drama.This is about a father, Chris Gardner who struggles with life. His job is selling bone density scanners that hardly works and he barely gets money. His wife leaves him and his son. He soon loses all his money and his house so he's forced to live on the streets. Now, he has an uphill battle to get his life back.I mentioned before that the acting is fantastic. Will Smith definitely deserves the Oscar nomination. Jaden Smith is turning into a rising child star.This movie can be boring at times and may lure some people to sleep. I was entranced by some parts and lured to sleep in others. But, I would check this out. I guess I should see Seven Pounds. I rate this film 8/10.",8,0,1,14 September 2010
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," The Best of the Three!
","Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade is no doubt the best of the three Indy movies. Everything is basically perfect throughout the entire film. This time around, Indy must save his father from the wretched Nazis and recover the Holy Grail before the Nazi scums do. The acting in this film is really good. Harrison Ford is great as Indy and Sean Connery is fantastic as Indy's father. The ancient knight and the scene with Hitler amuses me because I did not expect those characters to appear on the screen. I liked the score by John Williams. His music is great as always. This time, the cinematography is much better. I could see what was going on. Overall, this is a great finale of the three movies. Indy 4 is good as well. I rate this film a 10/10.",10,1,3,14 August 2008
Back to the Future," A Blast of a Movie!
","Back to the Future is a very good movie, better than I thought it would be. Everything is just about perfect with this film considering it came out in the mid-80's. The story is about a guy named Marty and his professor friend Dr. Brown. Brown invents a time machine in a car and Marty uses the car to travel to 1955 after a tragedy happens. While in 1955 and after messing up the way his parents met, he must fix this problem to avert another tragedy. The acting and directing in this film is great. The story is funny and some lines made me laugh like a hyena. The music makes the movie sound like a true 80's movie. 'Power of Love' by Huey Lewis is an instant classic! Overall, this a movie classic for the ages. I rate this film a 10/10.",10,3,4,1 October 2008
Goodfellas," Great Mafia Film!
","Maybe it was I watched the amazing second part of the godfather right before this movie, but I thought this was not as good as most people made it out to be. Don't get me wrong, this is an excellent film. It's one of the top mafia films I have ever seen.This is the story of one guy and how he spent his life since childhood in the mafia.The acting is superb. I was pleased at the performances by Ray Liotta, Robert De Niro, and especially Joe Pesci as the wild maniac. This also has to be Martin Scorcese's finest.One thing that bothered me here is there was no score, just pop songs. I liked the songs but I expected a score similar to the Godfather. I was disappointed there but that's pretty much my only disappointment.Overall, this is a very good gangster film. I recommend this to people who like these kind of films but it's also very violent. I rate this film 8/10.",9,0,0,1 November 2010
The Bourne Supremacy," Good, But Could've Been Better!
","I bought this movie the other day because I heard it was good and I wanted to see it. I was mostly pleased at the film but there were a few bumpy spots. Matt Damon returns as Jason Bourne. Bourne was staying low-life until his wife Marie was killed. He returns to the assassin he used to be and while evading the CIA, he must track the Russians who killed Marie. The story was great and the actors did a great job acting. Julia Stiles and Brian Cox really supported Damon's great acting. The action was just non-stop and plainly high-paced. I also liked the nice European scenery. The first problem was that the beginning part of the film moved a bit slow, but the action camera little after. The second and the worst problem is the camera work. The camera was just very shaky and many people suffered from headaches. Myself, I suffered a slight headache. Otherwise, the film is good. I rate this film a 8/10.",8,3,4,10 May 2008
The Great Gatsby," Modern Reincarnation of a Literary Classic!
","This modern retelling of the Great Gatsby is actually a lot better than people give it credit for. It's a film that goes a long way in successfully adapting the themes based on the abundance of wealth and love into the final product. It is visually enhancing and the visuals make the film borderline magical. It's vintage 1920's New York thanks to the strong production design and the costumes are realistic, thus giving the overall film a realistic tone. However the one thing that annoyed me was the music. The score itself was fine, but there shouldn't have been any rap music in a film that takes place during the 1920's.Baz Luhrmann's film has Luhrmann's trademark flair for visuals so the movie was certainly pretty. But this film is about a poor man named Nick Carraway who moves in next door to his mysterious neighbor, Jay Gatsby. The two men get to know each other slowly but surely, but when Nick finds out that Gatsby is in love with his cousin, Daisy, things will surely get complicated.Leonardo DiCaprio made an excellent Gatsby and he really captured the essence of the character. He really showed how Gatsby doesn't fare well in public and all his fake smiles, but he really showed the love that he had for the married Daisy. Leo had a scene here that really reminded me of a scene of his in Django Unchained and both involved tempers. Tobey Maguire does an excellent job as the narrator of the story who is drawn into the mysteriousness of his neighbor. Joel Edgerton does a great job as Daisy's suspicious husband, Tom. Carey Mulligan certainly makes an elegant Daisy.Overall, this is a fine adaptation of F. Scott Fitzgerald's beloved novel. With all the main characters here, each one of them has their faults and we hate them for that, but we are drawn into each character wondering what will happen next. I was absorbed into the film, and I even forgot at times what will happen (I read the novel, so I know), because I was so absorbed. If it wasn't for that blasted hip-hop music, this film would have been near perfection. But alas, a very good film anyhow. I rate this film 8/10.",8,2,3,22 August 2014
Hustle & Flow," Gritty Rag-to-Rich Tale!
","Hustle & Flow is a good tale although it's slight Hollywood-ized version of a rags-to-rich story. But that doesn't stop this movie from giving effective performances and a gritty hustle and pimp story. This story is one that the small-town people can relate with and it's well-written one at that. Now, this is not my kind of music but I can still appreciate the way people have come to succeed in this music industry especially when things seem the darkest.Craig Brewer's first feature is about a full-time pimp named Djay. Djay wants to get out of that business and prove to the world he has skills to be a rapper. When his childhood friend, who is a millionaire rapper plans on coming to town, Djay enlists the help of his friends to make sure he can succeed.In 2005, this film as well as Crash put Terrence Howard on the map. He is brilliant as Djay. We can see his earnest passion to become a rapper and he brings much to this role. This character is what brought Terrence Howard to stardom. The supporting cast is decent as well even though some of the female characters are quite annoying.Overall, this is a borderline great film that tells the traditional rag-to-rich tale. This is not my kind of music, but I can appreciate all the hard work these people do. I don't know where this film would be without Terrence. I enjoyed this gritty tale for the most part. I rate this film 8/10.",8,0,0,24 November 2013
Warm Bodies," A Welcome to the Zombie Genre!
","Warm Bodies is an interesting and rather fresh entry into the tiring zombie genre. Despite lots of good entertainment, we really haven't been offered something new, not until this movie came along. It's more of a romantic comedy than a horror and the film is told from the perspective of the main zombie, R. This film is touching, sweet, gruesome, and action-packed. I think everyone from both genders will enjoy the film.Jonathan Levine's follow-up to his 2011's 50/50 is a radically different story, but still emotionally-infused. This film is about a zombie named R who develops love for this human girl named Julie. But if his love is to be protected, he must avoid being killed by the humans and even more undead creatures called Boneys.The acting is actually really good. Nicholas Hoult does a great job as R. Teresa Palmer is really good as Julie and both the actors have great chemistry with each other. Rob Corddry has many scene-stealing scenes as R's best friend, M. John Malkovich is rather restrained, but that's because of the source material.Overall, Warm Bodies is an excellent movie and so much better than expected. This isn't the Twilight of the zombie genre as many feared it was going to be. The romance is actually endearing and bearable. This film is funny, smart, action-packed, has good special effects and is a really sweet film. I rate this film 9/10.",9,1,2,26 June 2014
Cinderella Man," Powerful, Inspirational Story!
","Ron Howard's Cinderella Man is certainly a true Hollywood Cinderella story. This film has the distinction of being one of the better boxing movies ever made. I think it's better than such classics like Rocky, Raging Bull, and The Fighter. I think what makes this story so powerful and motivating is the setting. This takes place during the Great Depression where nearly everyone was affected one way or the other.This film is based on the true story of Jim Braddock. Braddock is a former boxer whose family has fallen on hard times. When he gets an opportunity to earn money as part of a one-game comeback, he has no idea how special this comeback will be.The acting is really good. Russell Crowe puts up another fine performance as Braddock. Renee Zellweger is really good as Braddock's wife who cares deeply for her husband. Paul Giamatti is especially good as Braddock's manager.Overall, this is a film that looks to provide some meaningful inspiration. This is a film not really about boxing, but how a struggling family persevered with little or no money. All the boxing scenes were executed well and I have never felt tense watching a on-screen boxing match as I did with the final battle in this movie. It was probably the best boxing match I have yet seen. Ron Howard has added another great character story to his filmography. I rate this film 10/10.",10,1,1,15 February 2013
Jurassic Park," Great Film!
","Jurassic Park is one of Spielberg's best movies. i was so awed by this movie when I first saw it. Everything is just about amazing regarding this film. The story is about a dinosaur park off the coast of Costa Rica. There were rumors that the park was in serious trouble, so the owner John Hammond decides to get a dinosaur expert, paleobotanist, a scientist, a lawyer, and his grandchildren to endorse the park. Unfortunately, the dinosaurs are free from their domains after the power went out. Now everybody must have their survival instincts in hand. The acting is very good. I Liked Sam Neill as Alan Grant. The special effects were amazing. The dinosaurs are pretty darn perfect. The sound effects are excellent as well. I really loved the music in this film. John Williams did such a fantastic job with this score and themes. Overall, this is must-see movie. I rate this movie 10/10.",10,9,12,24 October 2008
Beetlejuice," Entertaining!
","Beetlejuice is a entertaining movie to watch and it turned out to be a cult classic from the 1980's. Tim Burton is one of my favorite directors because he has a great view on visuals in a movie. Obviously, the sets are pretty weird here. The special effects are okay but they need better work to be in today standards.This is about a couple who dies unexpectedly. They return as ghosts and now another family moved into their house. They hire a 'bio-exorcist' to rid of the family for good.The acting here is pretty good. Of course, Michael Keaton stole the show. His character is the opposite of his Bruce Wayne character. Winona Ryder is great as the daughter that has a great appeal to death Overall, this was a fun movie to watch and a good one to watch on Halloween. I rate this film 9/10.",9,1,2,28 October 2010
Valkyrie," Great Psychological Thriller!
","Valkyrie is one of the better recent psychological thrillers that came out. This movie has such an interesting story line and a great ensemble cast. This is a movie about why not all humans are bad. It proves that there are humans ready to sacrifice themselves so they can get rid of evil.This film is about one of the last attempts to assassinate Adolf Hitler. It's about how Colonel Stauffenberg and other Nazi-haters teamed up to plan an attack on Hitler.The acting is really good. This is one of Tom Cruise's better roles. He is very believing and even looks the part. Also, who doesn't want to see a movie that features Cruise, Bill Nighy, Tom Wilkinson, Terence Stamp, and Thomas Kretschmann all in one film.Overall, this is one moving, historical thriller. Of course those who studies history would know the ending of the film. Nonetheless, the course of the film leads up to an emotional ending. I also have to add that this film is probably one of the best accurate historical films I have seen. I rate this film 9/10.",9,2,3,18 October 2012
The Simpsons Movie," Very Funny!
","I have been a fan of the Simpsons for as long as I can remember. I have seen every episode ever made. I was very excited when I heard that there was going to be a movie. I have seen it opening night and I seen it many times since. I decided now is a great time to write the review.This is about Homer who brings demise to the town of Springfield by polluting the lake. Now Homer must do all he can to turn the town back into its normal self. Can he do it? I was laughing nonstop from beginning to end. My favorite scene was the Spider Pig song. I was laughing so hard, my sides were in extreme pain.This movie reminded me of the episodes of old. The new ones are great but nothing like the old ones. This movie had elements of the old episodes.Overall, this is one hilarious movie. I really hope they make a second film. I rate this film 9/10.",9,0,1,6 December 2012
All the President's Men," Back to School We Go!
","All the President's Men is a fine historical lesson for those who want to learn about the Watergate Scandal. What I liked about this film is that it does not deal with results, but it deals with how the whole scandal was uncovered. I am a big history buff, so this kind of film is up my alley. I must warn viewers that this film can and will be very boring if you are not into these kind of films. This film is almost all talk and no action. But, this film is boosted by a riveting screenplay and wonderful acting.Alan J. Pakula's film is about two reporters at the Washington Post, Carl Bernstein and Bob Woodward who risk their careers and even their lives to uncover the truth about what happened at Watergate.The acting is the strong point of the film. If this film didn't have decent acting, this would have failed. But the film was carried justly by Dustin Hoffman, Robert Redford, and Jason Robards. I almost think it was a crime that Hoffman and Redford were not nominated much when it came to the award season.Overall, this is a very good film when it comes to correctly telling the history. This is a good drama overall, but I felt this film was a little too long for my liking. Even as a big fan of history, I felt like some scenes dragged on. But nonetheless, we got ourselves a very good, accurate film about Watergate. I rate this film 8/10.",8,1,1,9 February 2013
Draft Day," A Surprisingly Good Football Film!
","As someone who is starting to gain appreciation for football and someone who completely ignores the draft for all sports, I wasn't sure how I was going to take this film. For one, I found the movie to be educational in regards to teaching me basics about the draft and the drama behind the draft. Secondly, I found this to be an oddly sentimental film with a high level of characterization when it comes to our main character, both personally and professionally. In short, I must happily confess that Kevin Costner created another winner. Ivan Reitman's film is about the general manager of the Cleveland Browns named Sonny Weaver Jr who gets a chance to rebuild his team when he seizes the opportunity to trade for the number-one pick. But he must deal with people such as his unhappy head coach and an owner who is threatening to replace him unless he makes a big splash. Kevin Costner is known for his roles in sports films and it is no surprise he is in this one. I thought he did a very good job and he had some tense scenes, especially when the draft began. Jennifer Garner was solid as the salary cap analyst and Sonny's lover. Denis Leary had some good scenes as the head coach and Frank Langella likewise as the team's owner. Overall, Draft Day was a fun sports film to watch as we see Sonny change his team around with pressure from all sides. In my case, this film proved to be educational and I can truly see how passionate NFL fans can be about the draft. The story was very good as it focused on the character of Sonny and how his personal life threatens his professional life. This is a different kind of sports film, but I liked it very much. My Grade: A-",9,0,1,13 March 2015
The Wizard of Oz," A Must-See for All Generations!
","If you are allowed to see only one movie in your life, I would advise you to choose this classic, the Wizard of Oz. If there is any film that deserves the best-ever film position, this film would take hold of it. It's a beauty that every generation can and will enjoy. It makes the old feel young again and the young feel like they can live forever. As for the film itself, it's a skillful film. Judging by today's standards, the special effects hold up very well. The twister seems more realistic than it does in the Twister film. This is very impressive since they had no computers back then.Victor Fleming's film is about the adventures of Dorothy and her dog Toto. After she is whisked away from her farm to the magical land of Oz, she is sent out to meet the wizard himself as she follows the Yellow Brick Road. Along her travels, she meets the Tin Man, the Scarecrow, and the Cowardly Lion. She also has a nemesis in the Wicked Witch.This film has a few stars but no one very famous at the time. It's biggest star is Judy Garland who found fame because of this film. Garland does a very good job and she is what makes Dorothy a classic character.Overall, the Wizard of Oz is the perfect film for the entire family and it will live on for generations to come. My favorite part is how this film masterfully transfers from black/white to color film. Filmmakers hardly used color back in the old days, but I'm glad they did here. This film also makes good use of it's music. Even if you never seen this film, I'm sure you have heard of some the songs. This is one of the greatest films of all time. I rate this film 10/10.",10,5,7,8 April 2014
The Soloist," A Decent Melodrama!
","The Soloist is one of those films I remember not living up to its hype, especially when it came to Oscar season. Perhaps that is why I skipped that film until now. It's really not a bad film at all, led by two central performances from Jamie Foxx and Robert Downey Jr. Granted, the film moves at a snail-like pace at times, but this melodrama brings to light some important issues such as mental disorders and homelessness. These two subjects should not be said in the same sentence, but in the case of Nathaniel Ayers, it unfortunately is the case. Based on a true story, Joe Wright's film is about a LA Times reporter named Steve Lopez who has a chance encounter with a homeless schizophrenic named Nathaniel Avery, who is incredibly gifted with the cello. Steve decides to use him as a story topic and in the process, a friendship was forged. The film is well-acted because of the two incredibly gifted actors in the lead. Jamie Foxx showed dramatic acting chops in 2004's Ray, and now he does so again in the Soloist. This may not be the best portrayal with this subject (Russell Crowe was better in 2001's A Beautiful Mind), but it was still a powerful performance nonetheless. Robert Downey Jr did a great job as the reporter who introduced this man to the world. Overall, The Sololist is a solid melodrama, although it's nothing special. The performances were excellent and I liked the story itself. The screenplay is a little weak and a little confusing at times, so thank heavens for Foxx and Downey! Poverty has always been a big issue in LA, but it seems like LA is the homeless capital of the world. A very important theme of this movie. A good, watchable melodrama. I rate this film 8/10.",8,0,0,26 January 2015
Dodgeball," If you can dodge a wrench.....
","This film is one of the funniest slapstick comedy ever. Ben Stiller was funny as always and Vince Vaughn was surprisingly funny. Stiller plays White Goodman and he is the snobbish owner of his up-to-the-style Globo Gym whereas Vaughn plays Peter La Fleur and he is the owner of Average Joe's. The gyms find out that there would be a dodgeball tournament held in a few weeks with a grand prize of fifty thousand dollars. Average Joe's need that money or else the gym goes to Globo Gym. The gyms ended up going and making it to the finals. But who wins? The movie will tell you that. All of the supporting actors were funny especially Rip Torn as Patches O'Houlihan. If you like Ben Stiller, you will like this movie. I rate this film a 10/10.",10,27,38,28 February 2008
The Fighter," Mesmerizing!
","The Fighter is one of the best sports movie I have ever seen. It ranks up there right next to Rocky. The thing about this film is that it is just not about boxing because it wouldn't be half as good if it was. This film is essentially a love story and bonding between two brothers. That drama is what made me really like this movie.This film is based on true events as it tells the story of Micky Ward and Dicky Ecklund. Dicky is a former boxer who is now a crack addict and Micky is his half-brother who aspires to be a boxing world champion. Will Micky let his brother, his new girlfriend, and self-centered family get in his way of reaching that goal? There were many strong performances in this movie. The most powerful ones were Christian Bale and Melissa Leo. I was shocked to see how much Bale transformed for this movie. He plays Dicky as if he was Dicky in real life. Leo is brilliant as the mother who cares deeply for her sons only if to make a profit for herself. Wahlberg and Adams delivered career-best performances as well.Overall, The Fighter is a worthy awards competitor. This ranks better than most sports films I have seen. I just loved the scenes when there were family issues. These scenes were powerful and they made me sympathize with the brothers how their lives been changed. I rate this film 9/10.",9,0,2,10 January 2013
Law Abiding Citizen," Gripping Thriller!
","To be honest, when I first started watching Law Abiding Citizen, I thought this was an action film. But it is more of a thriller and a good one too. This film sort of creeped me out since this kind of plot could happen in real life, I think. But, F. Gary Gray made a gritty thriller that somehow many critics hated.This film is about how one guy systematically murders people while in prison due to a flawed justice system. Does a prosecutor and the city of Philadelphia have what it takes to stop this guy? I heard lots of bad things about Jamie Foxx in this movie. He wasn't half bad but I wish Denzel took this role. He would have blown the movie out of the water. Gerard Butler is convincingly scary as the madman with the plots.Overall, this is a time-ticking, great thriller. I really like the way it was made and it separates itself from most recent thrillers. I rate this film 9/10.",9,1,6,21 November 2012
Up in the Air," One of George Clooney's Best!
","Up in the Air is a sweet, memorable film that features charismatic performances from the leads, a clever script, and a plot that people can relate to whether positively or negatively. This film has a great mixture of comedy and romance and that adds to the pleasure of watching this movie.This film is about a guy whose job is travel around the states to fire people. Reluctantly, he must train a new, young girl to do the same thing. Despite not be very willing about it, the life of this guy is about to change.The acting is extremely good. George Clooney gives one of his best, if not his best performance ever. Vera Farmiga is very good as Clooney's lover. But, Anna Kendrick really nails down her role. She comes into her own and out of the Twilight shadow with this film.Overall, this is a great followup by Jason Reitman after 2007's Juno. He really knows how to make these kind of quirky comedies. This film definitely deserved the 6 Academy Awards it got nominated for. I rate this film 9/10.",9,1,3,6 December 2012
V for Vendetta," Excellent Movie!
","V for Vendetta is a very great movie. It is probably one of the best movies I have seen based of a comic book in a long time. However, people may be turned away from this movie because of the controversial subject matter about government. Obviously, that did not turn me away. In fact, I became more intrigued about this movie.This is about a freedom fighter named V and he wants to end the fascist regime in Britian. Along the way, he saves a young woman from being attacked and their fates begin to connect.The acting is very good. Hugo Weaving as V has a clever way with words. Natalie Portman delivered an extremely good performance. John Hurt as the dictator makes me not want to cross him.Overall, this is a very good superhero movie. It has less action than what is made to believe. But, that is okay with me. I rate this film 9/10.",9,1,4,26 February 2012
The Island," Lots of Action But Lacks a Plot!
","I enjoyed watching The Island. This is a great sci-fi film that has a little bit of Blade Runner in the film. I wish that there was a plot because the movie could have been better. Granted, the action scenes and the special effects were amazing and that kind of makes up for no plot.Whatever there is of a plot is simple. Clones were created and were made to believe that all humans died from contamination. But, one in particular does not believe so. He manages to escape with one of the girl clones. But, they are being hunted down by their creators.The acting is pretty good. Ewan McGregor and Scarlett Johnasson did great as their roles. It's actually kind of funny to see that they did not know what basic terms meant in the real world. Djimon Hounsou did pretty good. I even liked Sean Bean's character.The special effects and the action are great to watch. About two-thirds of this movie is entirely action and special effects. They even overdid it a little, but not too much.If you despise loudness, this movie is not for you. Michael Bay did a great job turning a already-been-done-before concept into a great film. But, it could have been better. I rate this movie 8/10.",8,0,0,11 February 2009
"O Brother, Where Art Thou?"," Interesting Film!
","Well, the Coen brothers made another interesting film to add to their directing repertoire. This is somewhat more mainstream then their previous films but that's not saying much. This film still has the delightful quirky feeling that their movies seem to feature. Despite some preachiness and a weird music score to this film, I really had to like a film like this.This film is about three prisoners who escape and they go on an 'Odyssey' like adventure to reclaim treasure before the wealth gets flooded away.George Clooney is one heck of an actor. He chooses his roles very wisely(other than Batman and Robin of course) and that's why the Academy loves him so much. The rest of the cast led by Turturro and Blake Nelson were superb.Overall, this movie feels like a cross between 'The Three Stooges' and 'the Odyssey.' There are some adventures here that feature sirens and cyclops figuratively speaking and a trio of unintelligent delinquents. But, this a very fun Coens movie albeit a little more mainstream. I rate this film 9/10.",9,0,0,23 November 2012
Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby," Hilarious and Better than Expected!
","When Talladega Nights first came out back in 2006, I was not a Will Ferrell fan and I thought this movie looked incredibly stupid. But since then, I have gradually warmed up into liking the movies of Will Ferrell. I'm glad I did, because this is one hilarious movie I should have seen back then.This is about a NASCAR driver named Ricky Bobby who always comes in first place. But when the French racer, Jean Girard shows up to take the throne away from Ricky, things go downhill for Ricky. It's up to him to revive his life and career.I thought Will Ferrell and John C.Reilly had great chemistry together also evidently shown in Step Brothers. Ricky's parents played by Jane Lynch and Gary Cole are also wonderfully great. However, Sacha Baren Cohen stole the show. I really could not stop laughing when he was on screen.Overall, this is a really enjoyable comedy. It's not the best comedy in the world, but it is good enough nonetheless. I rate this movie 8/10.",8,0,1,9 March 2012
Semi-Pro," Very Funny!
","Semi-Pro, another Will Ferrell vehicle, is actually much better than all these reviews would suggest. It's not perfect and it's a pretty formulaic sports comedy, but there are many hilarious scenes and Will Ferrell is funny as ever. I'm disappointed it bombed at the box office, but he did redeem himself later that year with the hilarious Step Brothers. Some of the funniest scenes involved bear wrestling and painful eyeliner.Kent Alterman's film is about a rundown team, the Flint Tropics who are near the end of their existence. When the commissioner tells the owner and main player, Jackie Moon that four teams in their league will merge, Jackie gets his team ready to win.Will Ferrell is really hilarious as Jackie Moon. He's a great singer too as he showed with 'Love Me Sexy.' Woody Harrelson makes a nice addition to the cast and while this may not be his best role, he was still really effective.Overall, this is an underrated sports comedy. While it does follow the sports formula to the book, it has some very funny, R-rated jokes. It is great when Ferrell makes R-rated films because he can be even more funny than he is. I rate this film 9/10.",9,1,1,19 July 2013
The Godfather," Great But Overrated Movie!
","I really liked 'The Godfather' and the content of the movie. But, I think that this movie is overrated. Back in the 70's, this might have been the greatest movie ever. But in 2009, it's not.This film talks about the rivalry between the 5 Italian mafia families living in New York City. The main focus is on the Corleone family. After the patriarch of the family got shot, the youngest son Michael joins the family business for vengeance.The acting is definitely not overrated. Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, and James Caan all delivered marvelous performances that will be remembered forever.The score by Nino Rota is probably one of the most famous and the one that is stuck inside your head for months.One thing I have against this movie is that this movie is very long with boring scenes stretched in. This movie is nearly three hours long. I can accept that for the last LOTR movie because it's interesting and engaging.Overall, this is a great film, not exactly a masterpiece. I rate this film 8/10.",8,1,2,2 March 2009
