The Ring," Loose ends, who cares?
","I don't why so mamy folks demand that every question be answered in a suspense thriller like this one.  This movie is scary enough to be fun and creepy enough to be disturbing.  Being a skeptic, and not believing in anything supernatural, it is very unusual for a film like this to entertain me.  But this one did.",Null,0,0,7 March 2003
The Day After Tomorrow," Sela's still brooding
","Possible Spoilers!Superb special effects film almost ruined by cheesy dialogue, dubious scientific theory, and a story line so corny and sugary sweet it almost made me heave my popcorn. The opening scene with the credits was dizzying but spectacular and got better for the first 45 minutes or so. It's too bad the director didn't keep the love stories to a minimum.  Why couldn't we just get quick look at the character's personal life, like in the 60's sci-fi's and move on with the special effects. And what did Quaid hope to do to help his son when he reached NYC?  What a stupid trip to undertake.",Null,0,1,18 June 2004
The Shining," See the original
","The people who edit movies for tv almost ruined this classic. In fact, the new tv version is totally stupid. This is one of my favorite films but you need to watch the unedited version to feel the depth of Jack's madness. For example, a maniac bent on murder does not scream, 'you fouled up!' PULLLEASE!!",10,0,0,29 December 2002
Ocean's Eleven," 'Low tide, take me away!'
","What a shameful waste of actor's time and talent. Next time please give us an ounce of plausability in a techno-marvel tale. The best part of this dud was the end. I mean, it ended, finally!  And what was the deal in the closing credit's about, 'Introducing Julia Roberts'  Did I imagine this. One more bit of bad news. Endless showings on HBO.",2,1,6,14 December 2002
Drive," Music video or movie?
","This movie makes a great first impression. The getaway driver sitting in his car anxiously awaiting his partners in crime. Two mysterious characters suddenly run to the car, doors open and ready to go. The driver has obviously done this many times before. Monitoring a police scanner he makes his escape in a daring run to a stadium parking garage just as the game ends and he slinks away into the crowd. If it ended there it would have been a great short film. Instead we a subjected to a film that seems to be a backdrop for music from singers unknown to me. A movie called 'Drive' surprisingly crawls along at a snail's pace. There was one more short chase scene, and that about wrapped up the 'action'. It had a cast of good actors but the dialogue was so lame, it almost seemed like they making it up as they went long.",Null,0,2,5 October 2011
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," #64, Why?
",This movie stunk so bad that even a half can of Oust and my Sharper Image air cleaner could not clean up the odor of this stinker.  The only reason I can think of that so many people thought this movie was innovative and exciting was that so many high brow reviewers thought it was the greatest thing since sliced bread.  I am actually a big fan of Tarantino.  Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction were indeed classics.  This movie is a sure cure for insomniacs unless they are die hard martial art fanatics.  What is so clever and innovative about slicing heads and limbs off your enemies.  What is original about about the hero killing or beating up dozens of opponents that approach the hero conveniently one at a time.  Give me a break!,Null,1,2,10 August 2004
