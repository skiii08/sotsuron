The New World," Malick or no-Malick?
","Are you the type of person who would be interested in a Terrance Malick film? That is the foremost question you should ask yourself before going to the theater and spending box office prices. Do NOT think about the fact that Colin Farrell or Christian Bale are in this film before you spend your hard earned money. I would suggest you rent one of Malick's previous films. If you can sit through one of his movies, then you may have a taste for what he puts upon the screen. If you cannot sit through his films, then you have saved yourself a lot of money. Malick is for those who want to sit at a art exhibit and stare at a red dot like the dot was an original piece of art. Malick's work is for those who patrol art exhibitions by artists who make things out of garbage so they can 'fit in' with high society. Malick is popular with the Hollywood liberals--that should explain enough right there. It is him personality that makes him popular over his talent. Malick is NOT a good film maker. His audiences are small because his talent is limited. Malick spends more time trying to convey messages with LONG shots of grass, trees, birds, bushes, etc because his dialog cannot bring out the essence of the film itself. Malick cannot bring the better performances out of his actors that would create the same atmosphere (but better) that he tries to create with his terrific direction. Malick is not in the same league with the great directors of our time: William Wyler, Steven Spielburg, Clint Eastwood, etc. Men who can focus on an actor's eyes for the perfect emotion, men who can tell a story without focusing on a blade of grass, and men who can make three hour movies and maintain a proper flow of visuals and dialog. Rent The Thin Red Line, Heaven's Gate, or Badlands (all in the worse 100 movies of all time) and if you can sit through any of them; you are ready for Malick.",1,7,19,22 January 2006
Miracle," Russell at his best
",Kurt Russell has always been the most underrated actor of our generation. Miracle is the movie that should give him the clout and recognition he strongly has deserved throughout his entire career.This is an excellent movie with an exceptional performance by Russell.,10,1,1,22 February 2004
Shaun of the Dead," A movie you can sink your teeth into
","I had heard a lot of great things about 'Shaun of the Dead' from my friends over in the European countries. When I heard that 'Shaun of the Dead' was coming to American theaters, I was very excited and could not wait to see this movie.'Shaun of the Dead' advertises itself as a romantic comedy....with zombies. Shaun has all the elements of American comedies in it's first act. A great deal of the comedy is how Shaun and his friend, Ed, are unaware of what is happening around them since everything seems so routine. The movie basically pokes fun at how most of us are just zombies ourselves; going through the same routines day after day. While the beginning of the movie is a comic fest, the second half of the movie is all horror with small touches of humor intertwined. The last part of the movie is a true zombie film with all the horrors of 'Dawn of the Dead' and '28 Days' combined. I was glad that a friend warned me about some of the horror scenes before I had seen the movie. Why? Because I would have been under the impression it was a zombie spoof and had taken my eight year old niece to see this movie. Beware, there are beheadings, eviscerations, flesh being ripped apart, and blood and gore. I enjoyed 'Shaun of the Dead' a great deal and would recommend it to everyone.",8,0,1,25 September 2004
Alexander," Alexander the not so great
","Rather than go into a summary of this picture (since many have before this writing), I am going to sum this up quickly: Pitiful. Nothing is redeemable about this movie. I am not sure what the supporters are watching to like this even a bit. The acting is terrible. Angelina Jolie is a joke, Anthony Hopkins becomes annoying, Colin Farrell just makes you shake your head, and Val Kilmer is laughable. The directing is ridiculous. But bad directing is a staple of Oliver Stone (and before everyone gets mad---Platoon---one movie does not make a great director). This movie is so bad that the stink would knock a buzzard off a trash heap.",1,3,4,5 August 2005
Silent Hill," Interesting Version
","As a big fan, of the Silent Hill Playstation games, I was eagerly awaiting the release of the Silent Hill movie. I was enthusiastic about the release of this movie, but was a bit skeptical since the last great horror PS game (Resident Evil) spawned two horrible made films. My hopes were that someone embraced the Silent Hill experience and would not over bastardize the story and destroy it as Resident Evil had been destroyed. While the movie is highly influenced by the game, it does not completely hold to the storyline behind the Silent Hill games. While some fans may not enjoy this aspect, it had to experience some changes in the plot to make a feature film out of the Silent Hill story. The game was mostly an action/horror that took you to different places to fight different creatures. The plot, of the game, was a simplistic plot to advance you onward in your adventures. The screenwriters embellished the plot line and added some elements to make more of a feature film story. Overall, the film was a nice suspense/horror story. I would have liked to experience more of the evil dimension and had seen more of the creatures from the game introduced into the story. The overdoing of the religious zealots I understand were key to the story, but in a world were religious zealots have caused most of the horrors and trouble of a civilized world, I could have used a touch less of the zealot movements. For a very interesting and suspenseful movie, the ending was a bit weak and anti-climatic. I would still recommend Silent Hill and rate it a 7.",7,0,2,21 April 2006
Knocked Up," Knock It Off
","NetFlix sent me 'Knocked Up' today. I sat down expecting a nice comedy movie, but was highly disappointed.Every other word is the F-bomb. I have not heard that much foul cussing and language in a movie in a long time. It took any semblance of humor and tossed it right out the window. How can you laugh when every word is the F-word, the C-word, or the MF explicit.A total disappointment and a waste of time. I am sure someone will find this juvenile, vile thing funny---but there was nothing to laugh at. It was rude, crude (and not in a funny way), nasty (the characters treated each other badly), and just foul over and over.I would never recommend this to anyone.This is sad that this is what America finds funny in movies.",5,3,8,27 September 2007
"I, Robot"," Could have been the biggest summer blockbuster
","I will skip the summary part of my comments, since the trailers practically gives everything away.  The movie just fleshes out the trailer to two hours of time.The effects are great.  The robots look incredible and are well crafted. The automobiles, the buildings, and all the futuristic details are done with great care.  The story is average.  It is a good enough tale to carry the film along and put the characters in situations to carry the story.   The weak point is Will Smith.  A stronger script and a stronger actor would have made this one of the biggest sci-fi movies of all time.  Smith tries too hard to imitate Arnold, that it gets old within the first ten minutes. I was just waiting for him to say 'I'll be back' and make his performance complete.  A smarter approach to the movie would have given it a better, more futuristic feel.  The cocky approach cut into the movie and emphasized the weaknesses in the script. Overall, I still liked this movie.  I give a 7.  It would (and could) have been a 9 with: a) a better script--b)a better performance by Smith--or c)a stronger actor that could have overcome the script weaknesses.",7,0,0,18 July 2004
Cross of Iron," Shoot this one off your list
","I had read many reviews about Cross of Iron and decided that I wanted to watch this movie. Being a big fan of military movies, I was excited to see Cross of Iron. That excitement died FAST. I believe the excitement died within the first twenty minutes of the film. I found myself hoping for improvement as the film progressed, but it continued to slide deeper into the bad movie kingdom. One of the major disappointments is the acting. This is NOT the Wild Bunch and do not look for that level of work in this film. Seeing James Mason, James Coburn and Maximillian Schell on the cover would make you believe Cross of Iron would be well acted---well, that is the wrong assumption. The acting plain out is garbage. This is not the Maximillian Schell of Judgment at Nuremburg, nor is it the James Mason of Desert Fox. This is by far in the list of worse military films of all time. You want an older military film---go for Bridge At Remagon.",3,16,44,4 November 2004
X-Men: The Last Stand," X-Cellent
","Superhero/comic book character movies. Those two words used to mean a light, action adventure with some off-the-wall special effects. Movies like Batman, Daredevil, Electra, and The Hulk were poor excuses for movies and were made to just show the character in action. A new form of comic book hero exploded onto the screen when the first Blade was made. The script was more mature than people were accustomed to and it set the stage for more depth in screen writing for comic book adaption. Spiderman was the first to break the mold with a superhero and Batman Begins continued the development of a superhero movie to an intelligent, thoughtful adventure with dialog and characters you could care about. In the past, only Richard Donner's Superman made an attempt to rise above the normal comic book/superhero formula. The third X-Men movie continues the maturation of superhero films. The script is well written, the direction is very good and there is actually acting on the screen. None of that paper macho Electra and Daredevil acting we have seen in the last couple of movies. Because this is the third X-Men movie, audiences have bonded with some of the characters. Comic book fans will be more deeply involved with these characters and what happens will effect comic fans more than the movie fans. Main characters die. Yes, I know that does not happen in a superhero film---but main characters die in this movie. Not just one. I do not want to give much away---so I will only say that this is a good movie and a great start to the summer movie season. This is a definite film to watch on the big screen. One final note---there is an important scene after the credits. I do not like when movies do that since 90% (estimated) of the people never see those clips.",9,0,5,27 May 2006
The Incredibles," Awesome!! Wonderful !! Incredible!!
","The Incredibles is another great movie in a long line of quality work from Pixar Studios. While The Incredibles will not be held in the level of esteem that Finding Nemo was held; it is still high end work. The Incredibles is a story about superheros. Our hero's are sued for rescuing a victim and this act creates a domino effect. The rest of the world starts suing superheros and the superheros find that they are no longer wanted or needed. Thus, superheros now are 'retired' and the government puts them into a program to find jobs and normal lives. The story shifts, from that point, to a time 15 years later. We find Mr. Incredible dealing with being an average joe, dealing with his family life, with his three children, dealing with his midlife crisis of wanting to get into the action again, and dealing with the fear of not being strong enough. The Incredibles works at every level of movie making. The acting (voice overs) are wonderful. Craig T. Nelson is great as Mr. Incredible. He plays the aging superhero as a man entering his mid-life crisis years. A man yearning for a chance to be a superhero again. Samuel Jackson is terrific as Mr. Incredible's friend Frozone. Jackson brings a very good comedic performance to the movie. The story was well written. The Incredible's script is probably the most complete script ever written for an animated movie. While it has it's aspect that children will enjoy (the computer animation); the movie is directed to all audiences. I HIGHLY recommend The Incredibles.",10,0,1,6 November 2004
Stardust," Could Have Been A 10
","People are comparing Stardust to The Princess Bride because of it's fairy tale content and humor. Stardust is a nice enjoyable film, but it does not match the wonder and beauty of The Princess Bride. Robert DeNiro is brilliant as Captain Shakespeare. Shakespeare is a different type of role for DeNiro and he embraces the role to create a wonderful character you care about. You can see that DeNiro enjoyed his role within every shot of screen. Claire Danes is magnificent as Yvaine. Danes creates the inner beauty the character needs to make the story work and you root for her the entire film. Michelle Pfeiffer is wickedly delightful as Lamia. Pfeiffer not only plays the wicked witch, but brings some humor and life to the character to make her more interesting. Where the film is lacking is in the lead role. Charlie Cox is very weak as Tristran. He does not have the charisma that Carey Elwes had in The Princess Bride and he does not bring life to his character. Cox has more of a cardboard type performance that almost brings the film down to a B-movie standard. Overall, this is a wonderful film. The creators should have gotten a better lead to make it a better movie, but it is still highly enjoyable and worth watching. Not The Princess Bride, but close enough.",8,2,4,15 August 2007
Resident Evil: Apocalypse," A Guilty Pleasure
","The first Resident Evil is one of my guilty pleasures. I really enjoyed the movie, even with it's bad acting and simple story. Being a fan of the original game, I felt that the movie captured the feeling of the video game and basically that was my entire expectation going into the theatre.The video game started in a mansion where you played as a member of S.T.A.R.S. Either you played as Chris or Jill Valentine. The first movie followed the basic concept of a place where the Umbrella Corporation was conducting genetic experiments that went wrong. While the first film added the character Alice, instead of the game's characters, it was decently filmed and I find myself watching it from time to time. Like I had said, one of my guilty pleasures.The second movie (Apocalypse) basically follows a large portion of the second video game. The second video game you can play as either Chris and Jill again and you have to escape Racoon City while a super creature (nemesis) is tracking you down. The second film takes Alice on this adventure, while adding some interesting supporting members to her group. The second film also brings the original character, Jill Valentine, into the fold. There are quite a few new ideas introduced into the movie that were not in the game storyline, but they are interesting. Apocalypse has decent acting (think popcorn adventure movie, not Oscar), a decent script (except for the last 10 minutes), and a few decent well done horror moments. Apocalypse is better than the original (I know some of you may think that would not take much), and I see it falling under another DVD purchase I find myself watching time and time again. The only disappointment was in the last moments of the movie. The big bad corporating scene was just -- well, it has been done too many times and did not need to be done again. The end scene with Alice is a typical sequel setup that also did not need to be done. Milla Jovovich kicks ass, ala Laura Croft, without trying to act. Something Angelina Jolie tries too hard to do and fails at miserably. Milla plays Alice via the way a male action star would play a Rambo or a super cop. Because of the way Milla approaches Alice, it works.Oded Fahr is the best part of the movie. Fans may remember him from the Mummy series as the Templar Knight. Fahr is a scene stealer and a very pleasant addition to the cast.Sienna Guillery is just there as Jill Valentine. The kick ass character, from the games, takes a back seat to Alice and never is fully developed. Whenever Fahr or Milla are in the scenes, Guillery gets lost in the mix. Guillery is still hot to look at though (same as she was in Troy as Helen) and I had to laugh at the tight (very non-police) uniform that she struts around within. Overall, I enjoyed this film. While I really liked it, I am not sure what anyone else would think. I enjoy these kind of horror/action films: Resident Evil, Dawn of the Dead, Army of Darkness, 28 Days, and the Omega Man. If you are a fan of those types of films, I believe you would enjoy Apocalypse.",7,0,1,11 September 2004
The Great Raid," Great Attempt at staying awake
","I will not bother with a summary of the movie's details since you will read it other places on this site. This movie was boring from beginning to end. The producers (and director) took an important story and made basically a big screen movie of the week. The Great Raid has a low budget feel from the first scene until the last scene. Now the cinematography is nice, but the acting and story are just weak. There is not one character that you really care about because of the tepid acting. Benjamin Bratt is the WRONG choice for this film. Bratt is more of a TV actor and not a film actor. When Bratt tries to give his inspirational speech (to his men) he falls flat on his face. Bad speech, bad acting. The Japanese (and yes, they were HORRIBLE to our men) brutality was shown over and over and over. I believe it should have been shown to make the audience realize what our men went through. Again the film falls flat here---the brutality is shown in the civilian population and hardly ever in the POW camp. Why did we need to have a love story? Is it needed? No. The love story had no significance whatsoever. Another Hollywood write-in to have a female lead. I give this movie a 5 because of it's historical significance. The movie going experience would have been a 3. Directing would have been a 3. Acting would have been a 2.",5,10,22,12 August 2005
The Da Vinci Code," Well Worth It
","The Da Vinci Code is an outstanding film. Ron Howard does an excellent job of direction. The timing is nicely paced, the acting is outstanding, the scenes are beautifully shot and the film feels right.Ian McKellen steals the movie. McKellen is superb and his performance is definitely worth an Oscar bid. I enjoyed every single moment that McKellen was on the screen. This is McKellen's best work since he played Gandolf and he took full advantage of every second that he was on film.While the church, and the ignorant religious zealots, are condemning this movie; there is nothing in this film that exhibits an anti-church or an anti-Christian movement. The film does show the ignorance of some members of the church in their quest to gain more power over people. The movie shows the evils that religious intolerance can cause when one priest says that Christ sacrificed himself for the betterment of mankind and so shall his descendants. The priests talks about this to assure himself that it is right, and good, to kill innocents in the name of the church. While this is going on, that same priests talks about how the Vatican would punish him, and his cohorts, if they found out what they were doing. Therefore, the movie shows that it is not the entire church, but a small part, doing the evil things. As intelligent people, we see that this is true in all religions. This is exhibited in the news on a regular basis. There is nothing in this movie that would make a person question their faith--but there is enough that may make someone take an interest in Christian history. Is that a bad thing? I do not think so.",8,1,4,19 May 2006
Mr. & Mrs. Smith," Chemistry is not there
","Mr and Mrs Smith is not a bad movie, nor is it a good movie. Neither top biller (Angelina Jolie or Brad Pitt) have really been known for making superior films throughout their careers. With all the tabloid news and all the media hype about the Jolie-Pitt relationship, you think that maybe there would be a flame upon the screen. Especially since this is the supposed film that jump started their relationship. I am thinking Bogart-Bacall or Tracy-Hepburn type chemistry after reading all the media hype, but alas the chemistry is warm to moderate. It looks as if the stars are trying harder to act like they are not interested in each other than to act like the couple the script calls for. Mr and Mrs Smith is a typical low brow action movie. The kind where hundreds of enemy personal shoot at them and never hit, but they kill everyone without a scratch (maybe one scratch). The action is boring. The dialog is boring. The only saving grace would have been for Jolie and Pitt to let their real life desire flow into the movie. I rate this a 5. It is alright, but it is not good.",5,0,0,3 December 2005
Wedding Crashers," Crash Landing
","Earlier reviews tell enough about the 'Wedding Crashers' story that I will skip the summary and just dive right into my thoughts and commentary: The Wedding Crashers is a very good comedy. There are some moments of adult sexual humor, so do not take the kiddies to see this movie. Wedding Crashers is a fun movie with a great deal of laughs. Vince Vaughn is excellent as Jeremy Grey. This is Vaughn premiere role and well worth seeing. The other spectacular performance is by Isla Fisher. Isla Fisher is extraordinary as Gloria Cleary. If Marisa Tomei can win an Oscar from her average performance in 'My Cousin Vinny, then Isla Fisher deserves an Oscar for her comedic role in the Wedding Crashers. Yes, she is that good. Fisher steals each and every scene she is in. She devours her role and sinks her teeth into every line that she delivers. Vaughn and Fisher are the reasons to see this movie and both are worth the admission price. As for Wilson and McAdams: they are there and fulfill the require roles. But as the two main characters, they are severely lacking compared to Jeremy and Gloria.",7,0,1,2 August 2005
Ben-Hur," The pinnacle of film making
","I own over 2,000 movies on DVD or VHS. I have gone to many many more movies that have not been worthy of my collection, thus my exposure to film has been extensive. I mention this because through every film I have seen; I still come back to a film from 1959 as the greatest achievement in cinematic history. I have seen great films like: Return of the King, Saving Private Ryan, Braveheart and many more. While the modern films are wonderful and have a fantastic richness to them, they still are a 'small' notch below Ben-Hur. Today's films use a lot of computer effects for their battles scenes, their backgrounds, and even computer images for the stunts of their actors. Yet, Ben-Hur did it all without computers. I am still fascinated by the chariot race. Never, in film history, has anything matched the depth and excitement of the chariot race. Remember folks, this is 1959, nothing is computer generated. Some may say the naval battle scenes look a bit cheesy, but again it was 1959 and the scenes still work today. What can you say about the acting? Every single actor is wonderful. Heston is in top form as Ben-Hur. Steven Boyd is incredible playing the merciless Messala. Jack Hawkins, Haya Harareet, Martha Scott--all fantastic in their roles. Each performing the role of a life time. The actors are fantastic, but William Wyler brings more out of each actor than any director ever could in this day and age. Wyler had no computer animation to rely on, he had no high tech special effects crew, he had no computer program to fill in extras. Wyler had to find thousands of extras for many scenes and maintain control. Did you ever see Steven Boyd better? Probably not. Did you ever see any of the actors (except Heston, who is an acting marvel) better in any other role? Wyler just pulled the greatest performance out of each actor. The story: fantastic from beginning to end. While the film is over 3 hours long, you do not feel that it is that long. Every scene is lovingly crafted: the reunion between Messala and Judah, the trek to the gallows, the rowing scene, the naval battle, the chariot race, the Messala death scene, the reunion with Judah and his family, etc. After seeing thousands and thousands of movies, I always come back to Ben-Hur. This is the mark of fantastic movie making. Today's film makers could learn a lot by watching this film and 'learning' about acting, directing, and screen writing.",10,245,417,26 November 2005
Casino Royale," Boring James Boring
","After multiple generations of James Bond, it is time to put this tired, old, terrible franchise to rest. There was hope that a new Bond would inject life into a franchise that had long worn out it's welcome. Starting with the same boring old animated opening, it looked like more of the same regurgitated garbage from the past. This James Bond movie was poorly designed. There was limited story to try and force more action and killing into the movie. It felt more like a bad video game than a feature film. The story was terrible, the directing was juvenile and the (suprise)ending was too damn predictable. Put a tombstone of James Bond and move on----PLEASE.",4,4,7,15 March 2007
300," Decent Telling -- but inaccurate
","I hope that this movie inspires people to read about the history of the Spartans and the Greek cities that fought bravely against the Persians. I offer this link http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/300_Spartans for those interested to give a brief background and history about the battle. For those not interested in reading, I would suggest renting/buying the 1962 movie '300 Spartans' to get a better feel for the historical part of this tale. First, this is a super bastardization of the tale. There is very little historical value whatsoever in this movie or in the graphic novel. If you are looking for historic accounts, do not go to this film. This is pure entertainment--plain and simple. The visualizations are wonderful, the movie is nicely paced and it is highly entertaining. Acting is not at a premium though. Butler just constantly screams into the camera, rather than talking, and he plays his character more like a WWF wrestler than a Greek hero. Most of the dialog came straight out of the historical (see link) quotes or from the 1962 movie. I enjoyed this movie and I could accept 90% of the Hollywood/graphic novel liberties that took the place of historic accuracy. The one thing that I found highly amusing was that the Greeks were not armored clad (as they would have been). As I stated earlier, WWF was more the feel of the movie--muscled men wearing only helmets, but no body armor. Only an idiot soldier would wear just his helmet and history shows that the Spartans did wear beautifully crafted leather armor. I give this movie an 8 for it's entertainment value and it's nicely shot battle scenes. Had there been a little more historical accuracy, and a little better acting, this could have been a 10.",8,3,8,17 March 2007
Fantastic Four," Fantastic flop
","Fantastic Four was a joke. FF was a complete mess from the first frame until the last frame. The acting was sub par, the script was absolutely ridiculous and the direction was juvenile. Only one thing was remotely decent in this movie: the special effects. I did not think that a superhero film could be worse than 'The Hulk', but I was wrong. FF makes 'The Hulk' look like a great piece of film making. It is too bad that Spiderman and Batman have resurrected the comic book movie industry. Since Hollywood is swamped with terrible screenwriters, we have only to look forward to pitiful interpretations of comic heroes. The Spiderman and Batman Begins will be the rare treat we can hope for among this mess of garbage (Hulk, Daredevil, Electra, and Fantastic Four).",1,28,53,6 December 2005
The Simpsons Movie," The Funniest Movie of the Summer
","After 18 seasons on television, the Simpsons could have been an average product and it still would have drawn a big audience from it's loyal fans. The makers put a lot of heart and effort into the feature film to add new life, new jokes and a lot of laughter. The movie was refreshing and fun from the beginning shot to the end. Homer was hilarious at every turn and this cartoon character was more impressive than any feature film actor in this summer season of movies. Each family member had their moments and provided wonderful lines, humor and events that made The Simpson Movie a precious gem in a summer of bad movies. I would highly recommend this movie.",10,2,5,14 August 2007
The Island," Modern Logan's Run Atmosphere
","The Island is a story about an installation that houses clones. Clones that are purchased by (and bred for) society's rich and powerful. These clones are kept, in the installation, for insurance purposes. Insurance purposes you ask? It seems that the clones are being kept in the installation in case their 'sponsor' needs a new heart, a new kidney, or just to breed a child for the sponsor. The clones are led to believe that they are rescued people from a world that has been 'contaminated' and destroyed. This belief keeps the clones within the walls of the society and keeps them under control.Ewan McGregor plays Lincoln. Lincoln begins to start having nightmares and questioning his surroundings and the world. This starts the journey of discovery for Lincoln. Without revealing too much of the story, Lincoln finds out that the world is not what it seems. Lincoln escapes with his best friend (Scarlett Johannson) into the real world.Sean Bean, who is just good at everything he does, plays the manager of the clone installation. Once Lincoln escapes, he sets a mercenary unit on the loose to recapture the clones.Overall, I enjoyed the movie. I thought each of the three main stars were adequate. Bean was very good (as usual), McGregor is in fine form, and Johannson fits the bill as the female love interest. While the movie was entertaining, there is a flaw (of course) that may cause some people to lose interest: the mercs flying all over LA blowing everything up to recapture two escape clones. I found that a bit over the top. All these ex-SEALs running around (in broad daylight) blowing up vehicles, buildings, other people just to capture two lost clones. But while that was a bit ridiculous, the movie works. The movie promised to be a summer popcorn flick and it delivers.Remember that most movies are ridiculous. But a good product can overshadow the over the top antics and still produce quality entertainment. If I had to rate this picture (scale of 10), I would have to say 7.5.Besides Batman, this is the only worthwhile film thus far. In a summer of movies like Bewitched, The Island is a nice break in the idiotic and the stupid.",7,10,20,23 July 2005
