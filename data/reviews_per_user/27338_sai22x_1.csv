Requiem for a Dream," One of the best ever movies made.
","The most dark and disturbing movie I have seen. This is an epic on it's own. It has the same class as that of American Beauty, The Shawshank Redemption, Fight Club & Moulin Rouge! - Great flick in it's own league. Jared Leto and Jennifer Connelly look like they are made for each other.If you don't have a strong heart, don't rent this movie.",10,0,1,22 March 2002
