First Man," Shake and rattle
","Shake the camera and make loud noises repeat and we are flying. No we are not. Test aircraft do not sound like a worn out washing machine on spin cycle with a bucket of bolts inside the drum. Space capsules are almost surgically clean and do not have filthy panels and switches. So much for technical gripes and there were several more. On the human side: Test pilots are some of the most positive and aggressive folks on the planet not the morose, depressing individuals portrayed here. Foyle acts irritated about everything. I was willing to give this movie the benefit of the doubt but I should have paid attention to the users reviews and stayed home.",3,8,13,18 December 2018
