The Blair Witch Project," Anyone who thinks this is a good movie needs help!!
","Now I am the biggest fan of low budget films but this is just too much. I cannot believe that people say this is scarier than the Shining and Exorcist. It makes me want to throw up. There is no art to this. This is a piece of garbage I could have put together in my back yard in two days for under $50. This is even pretty bad for a shot on video movie. The people in this couldn't act even if they had the scripts nailed to their foreheads.These yuppie college kids talk like gangsters using the F word every chance they get. It took two people to direct this! I am sure the guys behind this think they are something, but I am also sure that this will go down in film history as the biggest scam ever.Now thats a label a film director wants! Makes Red Neck Zombies look like Dawn of the Dead.",Null,0,0,20 November 1999
The Blair Witch Project," Worst piece of garbage ever released!!!
",This movie mad me throw up! Not from the motion but from the thought that this trash is actually being called some kind of magic moment in cinema history. This movie insults me as a film fan! It is so sad that great directors like Dario Argento can't even get a theatrical release of one of his films and this can make millions. This is a perfect example of what is wrong with entertainment in America. It is no longer about art it is all about hype. This movie isn't even original it stole from not one but two movies 'The Last Broadcast' and 'Cannibal Holocaust'. This movie just got all this hype form a website! It would have sunk with out a trace if it didn't have an R-rating so they throw in the F word instead of coming up with some decent dialogue. The acting is some of the worst I have ever seen. The quality of the film is just like 'Redneck Zombies' and even that had better dialogue. I am a huge fan of independent film but this is something I could have done on a camping trip in two days with a $50 budget. I guess this is the future of low budget film so everybody go and buy a cheap camera and start shooting. Because you just might get your film released and become a millionaire. The worst movie I have ever seen!!,Null,1,2,23 October 1999
