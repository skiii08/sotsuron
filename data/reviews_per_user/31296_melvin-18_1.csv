Requiem for a Dream," Just Great
","This movie is so real and...just wanna say it made me feel so shocked. After reading lots of comments, I prepared my mind for something depressing, but this movie is just beyond that, its impact is, as one of the commenters here said, at the level of one of the powerful movie of all time.  Every actors did their job so great (For me, Ellen should get 2 Oscars for this role) and the directing is not just modern but very effective.  I love this movie and just hope everyone can see it.",10,0,0,16 May 2003
