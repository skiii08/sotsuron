10 Cloverfield Lane," Why Hollywood? Why?
","I don't usually write reviews and when I actually do it's mainly to praise good films that I love and want to share. If it's so bad I guess people will find out for themselves. But in this case I can't help myself because they've totally ruined all that was good about the first movie and I feel I must warn all innocent people about the upcoming disaster they are about to witness I'll give this one a 2 star rating only because Goodman's performance was fine and the initial setup, if not original is well presented. So the story goes with a girl waking up after a car crash, wounded and tied up in some basement by what seems to be some kind of creepy guy. It's not hard to realize that there is something more behind all this and we immediately start to suspect that this guy is not what the girl fears. Its very predictable but for now we can let it pass, hoping that the outcome will be surprising and amazing. Long story short: the outcome is surprising..ly , awfully stupid! Remember the monster from the first movie? well it seems that it was actually some kind of organic vehicle for some kind of aliens, and this girl suddenly becomes some kind of superhero and even destroys one of this huge monster-vehicle with a molotov she prepares while hanging from a car at 30 mts high while the monster tries to eat her inside that car! Really that happens! she drops a lit whisky bottle to the mouth of this gigantic thing and this molotov suddenly transforms into a mini nuke and starts exploding in the monster belly. You might be thinking: 'What?! You talking about Clover? You talking about the monster that destroys an entire city by itself and seemed unstoppable even by the whole army?' Yes I am. That same monster is now a vehicle and is destroyed by a girl with superhuman powers, a whisky bottle and a lighter.And you know what? I'll take that star back because it ended like they intend to keep doing more of this crap",1,5,10,22 June 2016
