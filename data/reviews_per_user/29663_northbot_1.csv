Skyfall," Not a Bond Movie
","I felt so mislead I am submitting my first IMDb review.Although an entertaining action movie, this did not feel like a Bond Movie to me. As many others have mentioned it was missing most all of the ingredients except for the Actor playing Bond and action sequences the rest were either non existent or very limited. Missing were the expected quantity and quality of Women, Gadgets, Cheesy One Liners, Fearsome Villain, Lead Henchman/woman, Final Rescue, Final Innuendo Scene and placement of the normally opening credit shot(Bond shooting at the barrel at the end.)For an action movie it was an 8, but as a Bond film it left me very disappointed.",4,2,6,20 December 2012
