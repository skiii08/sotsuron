Iron Man 3," Good... but not as good as the rest.
","How can you not like any of the Iron Man movies? They are exciting, funny, clever, and original. Robert Downey Jr. is amazing as Tony Stark. Of the 4 movies (including Avengers) this was my least favorite however.Having said that, however, this is NOT an unfavorable review. I loved Iron Man III. I just don't think it was as strong as the previous 3 movies.My main issue with the movie was the lack of actual Iron Man in it. You rarely get to see Iron Man in all of his glory, and then when you finally do, he is easily ripped apart by the enemy. Other than that, Tony Stark is great as usual, and the movie has all of the great one-liners, funny moments, and action that you would expect.",7,1,2,18 June 2013
The Hunger Games," Excellent Adaptation
","I was aware that the movie had been made while reading the novel. One thing I kept wondering was, 'How in the heck are they going to do this in the movie?' I just couldn't picture how the film could capture the imagery and storyline. I was very impressed with the movie. The casting was spot on, the acting was excellent, and the settings were perfect. So much of how the movie was filmed was exactly how I imagined it in the book.Obviously, the biggest hurdle in any movie adaptation from a book is trying to encompass everything that happens in the book into a 2 hour time slot. Let me just say that NO movie can do this, and no movie ever has recreated the entire story of a book. It just can't be done in such a time frame. Had they done that, people would complain that the 6 hour movie was too long. Despite these restrictions, the film did an excellent job of capturing the feel of the book, and the emotions of the book.In my opinion, anyone who is a big fan of the books should watch the movie twice. Once to learn about what is kept, edited in the movie and to digest the differences; then a second time to simply enjoy the movie, knowing already what has been cut/added, and just enjoy the feel of the movie.",10,3,10,29 March 2012
Man of Steel," Good movie, but should have been split into two movies.
","When I saw the original trailers for this movie, I thought 'Wow! This is going to be awesome!' Then a couple of weeks ago I saw the newer trailer that showed the General Zod scenes and all of the alien spacecraft and I was very confused. 'Is this the same movie?' After viewing the movie last night, I had kind of the same feeling. It was like Superman and Superman II all mashed together. I would have rather seen an entire movie of Superman being brought up by the Kents, growing up in Kansas and discovering his powers. As it turns out, that was the smallest part of the movie.The movie focuses much time on the back story in Krypton, and then a huge war on earth with General Zod. The entire story of Superman growing up in Kansaas is just a few rushed scenes viewed from flashbacks.The casting of Superman however is perfect. Henry Cavil is amazing as Superman. This could have been a great movie, but in the end, it's just a good action packed movie.",7,6,12,18 June 2013
The Runaways," Very Disappointing
","The movie is titled 'The Runaways' yet only tells the story of two members of the band... and the two least talented members as well. The best musicians in the band were Lita Ford, Jackie Fox, and Sandy West, and they are barely mentioned or shown. The movie ends up being a very self serving Joan Jett and Cherie curry promo and it is clear their egos and self interest got the best of them.For those of you who are unaware, 'I Love Rock and Roll', 'Crimson and Clover' and 'Love Hurts' were all covers. Joan didn't write any of those songs. There is nothing wrong with that... I'm just stating that to enforce the fact that while Joan is very famous, she is famous for her covers, not really for her own music. She is a great performer and understands the attitude and 'look' to entertain a crowd. Those skills are very important. I just take offense at how she ignored the other members of the band... especially when the other members were the REAL MUSICIANS who made the backbone of the band.If you are going to make an entire movie about the troubled family of Cherie Curry and her friendship with Joan, then don't title the movie 'The Runaways.'",1,11,21,12 September 2011
