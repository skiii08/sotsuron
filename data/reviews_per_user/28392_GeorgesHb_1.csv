Blade Runner 2049," beautiful
","Now if you are not a scifi fan you can still watch this movie.
Why? Simply put, it's beautiful. From the cinematography, to the light, to the contrast, to the color saturation, you will be in for a treat. In my humble opinion, Villeneuve made of this movie a work of art.Now if you are actually a scifi fan, you must watch this. The story line and setting are spot on. This movie surpasses the 30 year old one while remaining authentic to it.In short, be relaxed, attentive, and don't forget the popcorn trust me you will need it. :-)",9,0,2,20 January 2018
