The Equalizer," 'You are what you are in this world'
","If that line from the movie were true, Denzel Washington and Antoine Fuqua are the embodiment of it in 'The Equalizer'.Those familiar with Antoine Fuqua's filmography know that he likes it gritty, dark and violent, but also that his films are very much character-driven. That's what separates this film from your average action, revenge-type movie. Denzel Washington is Robert McCall, a man with a mysterious past who strikes an unlikely relationship with a young prostitute (Chloe Grace-Moretz). This relationship and what comes of it will make his past come clashing with his desire to leave it behind. Washington plays a broken man at odds with his choices, and it's no surprise how well he can play it. After all, he's done it before. But make no mistake, this is not 'Man on Fire'...This film is much slower and takes its time exploring both the character and his choices, which as the film progresses seem logical and consistent with what you've seen. It doesn't have Tony Scott's flare and visual tricks, but it's much smoother, less distracting, slicker and atmospheric. The action scenes are mostly well done, and Marton Czokas plays a worthy adversary to Denzel's McCall. Yes, some of the dialog is a tad cliché and some lines seem out of place, but it won't pull you out of the movie: this is not a movie about great dialog and it certainly won't win an Oscar for best screenplay; its strengths lie in the exploration of the character, his motivations and inner conflicts, as well as in the creation of a great visual atmosphere totally ad-hoc with the story. In the end, that's really what the film is about: a man, his past, which is never entirely revealed but does help to understand him, and how it will affect his future decisions (I did say mostly well done because for most of the film the actions scenes were actually plausible and added realism to the film, whereas the final showdown does go over the top...It's fun, mind you...but highly unrealistic. When you see it you'll know why)One additional aspect I'd like to highlight is the soundtrack, which contains songs by Eminem and Zach Hensey, among others, and really adds to the general dark atmosphere of the film. Sometimes songs in films are badly chosen and kill the mood...It's the complete opposite here, they enhance it and help heighten emotions.I'm not a huge fan of Fuqua's previous films, but I did enjoy Training Day, The Replacement Killers and Shooter for what they were. This movie is a step up in pace, story and visuals, while keeping some of his trademarks. If you like dark, well-paced gritty thrillers, or Denzel walking around with a broken gaze and nothing to lose, this film is definitely for you.",7,0,1,25 December 2014
Gravity," A minimalistic piece of cinematic beauty
","'Gravity' is a perfect example of how special effects can be used in an extraordinarily clever fashion to enhance the story instead of trying to tell it. This very minimalistic movie, with only two characters on screen, is visually stunning. It follows the aftermath of a space shuttle being hit by debris which leaves two astronauts adrift in space with all the odds against them. Space, with its vastness, unpredictability and empty silence becomes a character all in its own as our protagonists try to survive. That's when the special effects create a fantastic, wondrous world that captures the audience as it lays trap after trap for Ryan and Michael, played wonderfully subdued by Sandra Bullock and George Clooney. Especially the former, who totally plays against type and succeeds. You're never at ease, you never what know what's coming, what's true or what's an illusion and I don't think you'll ever feel the same about going into space. The short running time, the tension build-up, the intensity and the (for me) very satisfying ending make this a movie that you really shouldn't miss; it is a unique and beautiful piece of cinematic art. Movies which generate this kind of hype usually draw a lot of regular movie goers while driving away those with a more sophisticated taste. This time I'm pretty sure neither group will be unhappy.",8,1,2,24 November 2013
Life of Pi," A truly extraordinary adventure
","Amidst movies like The Hobbit, Jack Reacher and Skyfall, all packed with action, fighting, shooting, killing and breaking, comes 'Life of Pi', from director Ang Lee, someone who brings a different kind of cinema to audiences.I should tell you that I'm a fan of Ang Lee's and he's only let me down once (Hulk, anyone?), but I went into this film with an open mind and ready for whatever came my way.'Life of Pi' follows the life of Pi Patel from his very early childhood to his grown up years as he tells it to a writer interested in his unusual life story. We get a glimpse of Patel's life as a boy in India, his relationship with his parents, brother, God and.....animals. As a teenager and after surviving a shipwreck, Patel will experience loss, faith and the loss of it as well, but he will also develop a bond with a Bengal tiger that will change and shape him forever, and challenge everything he knew about life.Most of the movie is spent in showing this relationship and its effects in the leading character. Nothing can really prepare you for what's in store for you: I suggest you abandon any preconceptions you might have and simply enjoy the experience because as simple as it sounds, this story is absolutely surprising and there's no way to tell where it will go and how it will end.In fact, the characters in the movie didn't know it either and this helps your own disbelief.Additionally, the film is a visual feast. Unlike some other visually stunning films, however, the effects here are used to tell a story and to actually enhance it, not to dazzle the audience with outstanding visual effects. As beautiful as it is, the story is the most compelling part and though it might not be 100% original (we've seen movies of human befriending animals before), I guarantee you, as a movie junkie that I am, that you have never seen one like this; I think the fact that the protagonist is Indian and the director Taiwanese helps this film to be culturally and philosophically very different to what we're used to and this factor made the experience all the more rewarding. As a side note, this movie is ideal for families: the movie theater was full of kids and they all enjoyed it. There are no scary scenes, no brutality, no cursing: just life, with its share of sadness, love and happiness.I wouldn't go as far as saying this is the best film of the year, but I can say for sure that you will not see another film that even slightly resembles this one in terms of story, visuals and life lessons. Go see it, you won't regret it.",9,4,8,5 January 2013
The Grand Budapest Hotel," Why you are likely to enjoy the Grand Budapest Hotel
","Some people seem to wonder why The Grand Budapest Hotel has garnered so much attention, praise and box-office success compared to other, arguably better Wes Anderson films. I, for one, have to say that I found The Royal Tenenbaums or Moonrise Kingdom better, more complex films. But I do understand the appeal and on reviewing this film will try in my very humble opinion, to dispel the mystery.Having watched 99% of Wes Anderson's filmography I would say this is by far his more accessible movie, both in the story and narration of it. It's a simple, pretty linear story, easy to follow, charming from the beginning. What I found makes this film different and easier on the viewer is that much more streamlinedThe Royal Tenenbaums had a lot of intersecting stories, as did Moonrise Kingdom and here every characters seems to serve the purpose of telling ONE story: how the aging Mr. Mustapha came to own the Gran Budapest Hotel.As always in Mr. Anderson's films, the concepts of family, friendship and loyalty are explored with nuance and subtlety as young Mustapha befriends the hotel concierge, Mr. Gustave H (played wonderfully by Ralph Fiennes) in a relationship that will change both of their fates. Young Mustapha, a lobby boy at the hotel, is being tutored by Mr. Gustave, and finds himself in the unique position of having to help his mentor when he's accused of murder. What ensues is a cat-and-mouse situation as Gustave is being chased by the police and assassins while he tries to clear his name. Although it sounds dramatic, the film is mostly a comedy that revolves around the two main characters and how their relationship evolves into a friendship that will last a lifetimeas they try to stay alive.For those familiar with Wes Anderson, you'll find some of his trademarks here: colorful supporting characters who make brief appearances with long-lasting impressions; tremendous attention to the detail of each frame, beautiful symmetry in the shots and a visual style that is all his own. One particular element that enhanced the film this time is that it was filmed in Europe so the shots of pre-war European towns totally add to the general feeling of nostalgia depicted throughout the movie (it's set in the early 1930s).I read somewhere that this resembles more a European film in that explores a social world that does not and did not exist in the US, and I have to agree. The myriad of British actors present add to that feel: Jude Law, Tilda Swinton, Tom Wilkinson and of course Ralph Fiennes.I honestly think that being much more accessible to wider audiences than his previous films, friendlier if you will, this is a movie that will appeal not only to Wes Anderson fans. It's just a beautiful cinematic experience, both narratively and visually. It actually reminded me a lot of Ernst Lubitsch's 'Ninotchka', in the humor, wit and nostalgia. Add to that the bonus of seeing F. Murray Abraham in a prominent role again and you're set.",9,1,3,26 December 2014
