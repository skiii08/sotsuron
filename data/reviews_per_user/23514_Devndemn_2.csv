The Blair Witch Project," 'Blair Witch' Revives Faith in Originality and Terror in Horror Films
","Sick of the recent wave tepid and trite horror to come from Hollywood, I am delighted to report that this film revives not only the genre itself...but filmmaking as a whole.  This 'mockumentary' follows three film students into the Maryland woods in search of the mythical Blair Witch.  They disappear...and the footage found four months later details what terrifying occurences befell them.  While knowing the film if ficticious, the viewer is still left with a feeling of uneasiness watching the slow and painful mental and physical breakdown of the central characters.  The tears and sheer fright portrayed on screen by the actors, however, is real.  With this in mind, certain scenes carry more impact and leave the viewer both frightened and quesy.  The scene in which Heather apologizes to the families of her friends (and her own family) while crying is especially moving...she then closes with the line:  'I'm scared to close my eyes and I'm scared to open my eyes.'  A few words summarizing her fear and anguish to emotional climax.This film plays on the old 'things that go bump in the night' scenario and puts it into a perspective where every sound heard becomes relentlessly horrifying.  Every little thing that goes wrong becomes seemingly bigger and more engulfing.  Here, the characters' panic becomes increasingly more profound and their fear paramount.  By the end of the movie, they lapse into a state of total shock as things become more and more harrowing...and the final scenes show a blood-curdling glimpse of pure terror in the wake of an unbelievable nightmare.'Blair Witch' works on so many levels, and is by far the most orginal film to come along in many years.  With no need for the Hollywood image of mainstream horror, it sets itself apart on the sole purpose of a horror film:  the scare the audience. In this film, you will not find the typical, boring cliches of the slasher film...nor the trappings of FX-laden frighfares...no 'Buffy', 'Party of Five' bad actors/actresses...no 'hip' teen music or look.  What you will find is a well-made, well-conceived, and well-produced picture with exellnt casting and a feel that will linger with the viewer forever.  This film challenges the viewer to use the imagination...and to think of the deep, dark horrors of our own minds in the darkness.",Null,1,1,31 July 1999
The Fly," Thinking Man's Horror
","David Cronenberg has always managed to direct stylish, off-beat films that bear his unmistakable touch.  This film is an example of the director at his finest moment.  More than anything else, this is a love story...a story of human compassion in the face of transfiguring degeneration.  Jeff Goldblum excels as Seth Brundle, a man with good intentions that go bad through no fault of his own.  Equally as powerful is Geena Davis as Veronica, his love. One of the main themes of 'THE FLY' is how love transcends the boundaries of the physical.  Even as Seth's body deteriorates and metamorphasizes into a monstrousity, Veronica never leaves his side.  She remains the one constant in his life as it crumbles about him.  She never lets his appearance deter her from keeping her love the only solace Seth knows. Even as Seth fights to keep in control of his mind as the mind of the fly (the instinct as opposed to the reason) continues to take over, Veronica remains at his side.Another theme, as mentioned above, is not only the physical deterioration of the body...but the mental breakdown as well.  Seth battles constantly to keep the irrational, instinct-driven mind of the fly at bay as to keep his own logic and human reasoning in control (to keep Veronica safe more than anything else).Cronenberg has always managed to invent films that have a 'body and mind' theme.  Efforts such as 'THE BROOD' and 'VIDEODROME' relate to this theme more clearly.  Despite the visceral special effects, this film remains a seminal classic.  It gains and never loses a human touch that drives the horror elements home with gut-wrenching success.  A must-see for Cronenberg fans and a nice, surprising shock for evryone else.  You do not need to be a horror buff to appreciate this classy, but sick, film!",Null,1,1,11 July 1999
