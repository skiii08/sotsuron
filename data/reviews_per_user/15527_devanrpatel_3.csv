Moneyball," It's interesting, but not quite my type of movie.
","I personally liked seeing the characters push past their issues, but I would have enjoyed it more if I was more into sports.",7,0,0,19 March 2020
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," Accurate to the book and even has a chilling conspiracy!
","The previous movie deviated from the book in multiple places and in general I didn't really enjoy that, but I saw this and I noticed everything aligned well. Plus, I have a feeling that Willy Wonka planned every minute of his tour down to who would be eliminated and where! All in all it was pretty good.",8,1,3,18 February 2020
Joker," At first confused, but I figured out the beauty of it looking back
","Thing is I at first was continuously confused by this movie because I thought it was riddled with plotholes, but when I looked back and took into consideration that it may not all be real, I actually saw this as pretty good! Plus Joaquin Pheonix was so confident in his role!",8,2,3,18 February 2020
