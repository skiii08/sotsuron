Blade Runner 2049," A slightly fuzzier reflection of the original
","I loved Blade Runner, so was apprehensive about this, especially when I saw friends comments about it on social media. But I was relieved on seeing it. It has recaptured the feel and loo of the original, but updated it as well. The plot, whilst a bit hokey, is a minor factor (as it was in the original, to some extent) as the real point of this is to examine the similar themes of the original - who am I? Where am I from? This does that equally well, and also added some newer elements to consider.",9,2,9,14 April 2018
Requiem for a Dream," A well constructed cautionary tale
","This is a harrowing watch in places. But it is also well constructed. Camera angles are distorted, as are the images, to create a sense of the disorientation that comes with drug use. Edits are used to show the repetition of the drug taking itself, as well as the various arrests. And the various stories, none of which end well, are convincingly told, so that the downward spiral they all take - some due to choices to get high, some due to bad choices over dieting pills, are all convincing, if neccesarily going to the worst extreme. The soundtrack also adds to the disjointed ness and disorientation of the film. This is not for the faint hearted, but it is well acted, directed and written, to add up to an excellent piece of cinema.",8,0,0,30 November 2019
Deepwater Horizon," Action move NOT documentary
","The events in this film are true, and terrifying as a result. But it still feels like an action movie in many respects. The set up of the good guys and bad guys is plausible (though a little too technical for me to follow) and the actual disaster is suitably adrenalin fuelled, and harrowing. But its unclear how much, if any, of this has been dramatised, so whilst and enjoyable film, the simplistic black and white analysis of what went wrong is unsatisfying.",7,0,1,4 November 2018
Detroit," Tense and disturbing
","A film which shows what happens when racist police are cut loose without restraint. The horrific actions of the Police in the Algiers Hotel is shown in disturbing detail. I knew little of these events before seeing the film, and the film says parts are a best guess at what happens, but even so, if this is even partially correct it is truly shocking. The actors are all convincing, and the film is tightly directed and well edited, so that whilst quite long, it doesn't drag. A harrowing, but essential watch.",7,0,2,3 August 2018
The Death of Stalin," Blackest of black comedies
","An examination of the absurdities of dictatorships, where whats is acceptable is decided by who has the most power, even though all are in fact equally repugnant. The film is funny in places, but also truly horrifying in places when characters casually discuss or joke about truly evil acts. The characters are all well formed and acted, particular stand outs for me were Beria, Khruschev and Zhukov",7,0,1,14 April 2018
Akira," Animated Art
","Its been a while since I've seen this, but as the first anime I saw, it stuck in my memory. The animation, and style of animation (how shots are framed, etc) are excellent, the story intriguing (though from memory, it goes a bit bonkers at the end), and this is talked up by many reviewers for good reason.",9,0,0,23 August 2018
Darkest Hour," A behind the speeches biopic of a few crucial weeks in World history
","This is a great mini biopic of Churchill, shown with a lot of his all to obvious frailties (hes a bit of a bully, prone to depression, and also flight of fancy) built around key speeches he gave which kept Britain, teetering on the brink of negotiating an end to the war, still in the fight. The politicking against him is well documented, and as a character piece this is accurate, and well portrayed by Oldman. However, having read a biography of Churchill, I was troubled by one scene, which was pivotal, but actually fictitious. Whilst I understand that this is film, not a documentary, I still felt it jarred slightly. It didn't ruin the film for me, as overall this was well done.",8,0,3,14 April 2018
Amistad," Slavery on trial
","A well crafted tale. This is about the legal case surrounding the Amistad, though the horrors of slavery are presented on more than one occasion. The cast are all excellent, with many famous faces taking part. It is a long film though it is hard to see how it could have been shorter, as there is no real wasted time, and it passes quite quickly.",8,0,3,9 November 2018
The Impossible," Decent,but not outstanding
","After the Tsunami, the rest of the story is less compelliing, even if based on a true story. That said, the actual disaster is terrifying to watch, and this is worth watching just for that.",7,0,0,19 August 2018
"Crazy, Stupid, Love"," VErry funny Rom Com
","This is a great film. The characters are well rounded, and acted, the stories all believable, and the way they all intertwine is well done, with an actual surprise twist in one respect. I laughed out load a lot to this film, Steve Carrell is ace as the boring husband, and in fact all the roles have good turns.",9,1,2,28 October 2018
Alexander," Overlong but decentbiopic
","This has been slagged off by some reviewers, but I found it to be easy to follow, and reasonably acted. I can't assess its historical accuracy, but usually feel that criticisms on that basis are often over done - these are historically based fictional films, not documentaries. The story is a good mix of battles and biopic, and my main criticism is that a good half an hour at least could have been trimmed off.",7,0,1,8 November 2018
Spider-Man: Homecoming," Spider man comes of age
","The basic story line is that after the Avengers gig, Spidey is mentored by Tony Stark, who effectively ignores him and lets him just be a normal kid.Except for giving him a new suit. When a new villain emerges, Spidey has to deal with him, but in so doing messes up enough that he losses the suit, and has to prove himself without it. This nicely meshes Iron man into the story as a mentor, and obviously sets up closer work for Spidey with the Avengers in the future. But it also stands alone as Spidey comes of age having to make tough choices. Well acted, with some good light heartedness fromSpidey, but also his school buddy,. This ages down Spidey - from older to younger teen - than some of the other version, but works well anyway.",8,0,1,6 August 2019
Alien," Space as industry
","The look of the Nostromo in this film is mainly like a huge refinery, or oil platform in space, with dirt, steam and pipework everywhere.. The only exception is the crew areas, which has some softening comforts. So this is space as an industrial project. The alien horror is iconic, and the film captures well the claustrophobia and fear of the untrained crew as they battle a hunter which out classes them in all but technology. A Classic.",9,0,1,16 August 2018
Black Mass," A steady, but not standout, true gangster film
","The film tells the true story of Whitey Bulger, and there are various strands of it which could have been the focus of that story (his links to his Senator Brother, links to the IRA, etc) , but the one chosen is his partnership with the FBI. This reveals the murky nature of the FBI at that time in which his agent handler is more concerned with using Whitey to further his own career, protecting him as a source, rather than using Whitey as an informant to bring down the Italian Mafia. This is because they grew up togethor. The inter-relationships are sketched out more as politics, and business, rather than personal, and whilst engaging, the lack of that personal element is what keeps this film as a steady film, rather than an outstanding one, despite some excellent acting, and period style.",7,0,0,24 May 2018
Doctor Strange," Hokum Pocus fun
","A good romp, with a fairly standard trope about a scientist becoming a scrceror, but played well with the usual elements of marvel humour which work well. The story is fairly simple, and again a trope (rogue great pupil goes to the dark side) but is enough of a macguffin for the real point of this film - to set up the Dr and lay the foundations for future films. The SFX are excellent and mind bending/confusing in parts, and the Inception style street bending during fights very originally done.",7,2,2,4 November 2018
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," A Coen-esque thriller
","I started watching this believing it to be a true story (whereas it is just inspired by one). I gradually twigged that as the story became increasingly surreal, and the characters became more extreme in their actions. But that said, the actions and twists make sense within the characters as portrayed, as they are all well rounded and acted, if all slightly nuts in their own way. The film had the off kilter feel of some Coen Brothers movies, which is no bad thing in my book.",8,1,2,14 April 2018
Bohemian Rhapsody," Great biopic and tribute
","As a Queen fan, there are enough songs in here to remind me why I loved them. But as I was never an obsessive fan, theres also a lot of story in here that makes it seem refreshing and interesting. The performances are all excellent, though I can't verify the trueness of the incidents - based on other biopics I suspect there will have been some fiddling. However, this feels like a balanced insight to their story, and one I enjoyed watching",8,2,2,5 June 2019
Bird Box," Well done Apocalypse with a gimmick
","Whilst the central threat is vague and unexplained, the characters in this react fairly realistically to it - some want to help others, some are just scared, and some are only concerned with their own survival. The film nicely charts the survivors development of strategies to cope with the situation, and adds in a nice curve ball with the idea of 'collaborators'. The idea of birds warning of the danger gives the film its name. Sandra Bullock is excellent, as are the other performances. The film is tautly played switching between the present and the backstory, maintaining tension in each storyline.",7,2,5,6 January 2019
Watchmen," A rare treat
","Adaptations of Alan Moore graphic novels have a mixed record, but this one is one of the ones that works. Although the story is altered significantly from the Graphic novel in terms of the final twist, and a lot of the supporting details is necessarily missed out, this is still true to the spirit of the graphic novel. The characters are brought to life and acted well, and the special effects are well done but not over the top. A good adaptation.",8,0,0,14 November 2018
28 Weeks Later," Weaker than the original, but still good
","Less original than the previous film, this is a more typical zombie film, of a besieged area trying to withstand the hordes. It is well enough told, and filmed, but nothing outstanding.",7,0,1,9 August 2018
The Revenant," Grim but beautiful
","Beautifully shop, with some fantastic lighting effects (the first moose hunt for example), but also grim in its subject matter and violence, this is a western which is realistic rather than mythologised. The action is fairly constant, and despite being quite long, this was an enjoyable romp.",7,0,0,23 April 2018
Apocalypse Now," Epic
","I love this film. I've read the book it was based on, watched all the extras on the DVD, and the documentaries about its making. And the more I know about it the more I love it. Its hard to realise how ground breaking (technically) and controversial it was at the time (due to its subject matter, but also due to cost), and how difficult it was to make. All of it which made its name at the time, but its reputation now is based on the film, which still works today, with some epic set pieces, and excellent depiction of the lunacy of the Vietnam war, and a flawed, but still interesting, journey into the madness and immorality of war in general.",10,0,2,19 August 2018
Dunkirk," Divisive work of art
","Reviews on here seem to love this film or hate it. Some of the criticisms seem churlish (it didn't talk about this or that aspect of the battle - well it isn't a documentary); others have perhaps some merit (the characters are pretty thin - but theyre thick enough I think). But I LOVE this film. I thought it was visually stunning, some of the action scenes (various ship sinkings in particular) are truly terrifying, the soundtrack was compelling and helped pace the story, and while there was not much dialogue, that was part of the point, and the structure of the storys intertwining is technically fantastic. I think the characterless ness of the main characters was to make them more of an everyman, rather than anyone in particular. It allows you to become emersed in the rollercoaster without having to keep track of complex characters arcs. And whilst some see that as a weakness, I see that as a strength. The point is to try and make this a visceral experience of the desperation and fear, and helplessness of those involved. And it does that extremely well.",10,2,4,14 September 2019
Aliens," Let's rock!
","One of my favourite films. An action war film, in which its ok to cheer every kill - they're not human after all. The Aliens architecture is both mesmerising and terrifying, the Colonial Marines are a great military squad, with all the banter and bravado that comes with it, as well as some cool kits - M41a Pulse rifles, APC, gunships. This is space as a battlefield, even though its mainly planetside. And although an action/war film, it still has some nice sci fi elements - Waldos, suspended animation, shake and bake colonies. A perfect mix of elements, nicely paced and shot, with enough characterisation for you to be rooting for the marines as they go down, or cheering when Carter does.",10,2,5,16 August 2018
The Princess Bride," A Classic
","A great adventure romp, book ended by the fact that this is a story being read to a sick kid. It has adventure, sword fights, pirates, romance, great comedy, memorable and well rounded characters, and a great case. I have watched this many times. I expect to watch it many more.",10,0,0,13 November 2018
The Grand Budapest Hotel," Engaging Fantasy
","A fantasy, comedic story of the owner of a grand hotel. Luridly coloured, and inventively shot, the story is daft but engaging, with many humorous moments (but few to me were laugh out loud) and the characters and events quirky, but not to the extent of disbelief.",7,0,0,18 November 2018
Tucker and Dale vs Evil," Hilarious role-reversal horror
","This achieves what many comedies fail to do - its really funny. The story is a daft role reversal where the red necks are just going about their business, and the white college kids, in trying to 'protect' themselves form the, end up dying in horrific ways. The humor is constant, and the horror is more gore than horror, but well enough done. A great fun film for horror fans",9,0,0,27 December 2018
28 Days Later...," A very British Zombie apocalypse
","Although the zombies don't eat brains, and are more accurately infected, this is a good presentation of the apocalypse in Britain. The key point being the lack of guns, making this a more visceral survival film, and when the guns are available, it involves Squaddies. The soldiers are believably shown, and overall the characters are good. The depiction of the apocalypse in Britain is well depicted. A good addition to the genre.",9,1,4,9 August 2018
Get Out," A modern classic
","This is a great film. Its original in its story line, well put together, building an unsettling atmosphere from early on which carries on even when it lurches into slightly daft horror. There is an undercurrent of black and very dry humour, which whilst not laugh out loud, is noticeable. The performances are all excellent, and the pacing excellent, and the cinematography is quirky and often visually striking. All round an excellent film.",8,0,5,27 April 2019
The Theory of Everything," Scince light biopic with a heart
","This tells the story of Richard Hawking and his wife, and is sensitvely told from all perspectives, the difficulties he faces, as well as those of his wife, as she struggles to care for so long for some one she loves, but ultimately thought would only be alive for a much shorter time. The characters are all sympathetically detailed, so no one is the goodie or the baddie, all just very human, with foibles an failings that they try to overcome. Heart warming.",8,1,1,2 November 2018
2001: A Space Odyssey," Space as a ballet
","With its long drawn out scenes of simple space activity, this creates the impression of space as a ballet. It also explores the themes of the book well, and with notable visual effects throughout this is a visual feast. But the long scenes drag in places.",8,1,2,6 August 2018
A Clockwork Orange," Stylish adaptation
","This film looks great - the gang style, and the decor of the various sets is great. The story, based on the book, has the cop out american book version ending, but is still a good adaptation of that book. It captures well the banality of the gangs actions, and also questions societies response to their violence.",8,1,2,16 August 2018
Mystic River," Dark crime drama
","This is a great, if depressing film. It has well drawn characters, who although all share the same roots, have become very different people, and all are wrestling with their own traumas, though one dominates. The who dun it element is done well enough that it give so enough clues to work out who did it, but only at about the same time the other characters do. The ending is tragic for one character, unjust for another, and sort of happy for a third, but overall this is a gritty drama, with dark themes, and no happy ending. But it is extremely well put togethor and acted by all involved.",8,1,1,27 December 2018
Zombieland," Fun spin on the zombie movie
","A not bad take on the genre. Hearing the neurotic nerds rules, contrasts nicely with the rednecks dive in attitude. It introduces the new idea of what would happen if you met a celebrity after the apocalypse, and is told quite entertainingly. The zombies themselves are not well realised, but then like many zombie films, its not really about them.",6,0,0,23 April 2018
Tenacious D in the Pick of Destiny," Pretty good
","I had just watched the TV series before watching this, so was a little dissappointed, as it re-hashes a fair amount from those shows, but it spins it enough and adds enough new bits to still be fun, and most importantly in ANY comedy, funny.",7,0,0,1 March 2018
All Quiet on the Western Front," The definitive version
","Although remade, the original packs a punch the remake doesn't, mainly because it being made in black and white and when it was made giving it an authenticity that is hard to replicate. The characters are well sculpted and acted, and he message resonate down the ages, with the failure to heed it in WWII adding to its strength",9,2,2,17 August 2018
Downfall," Sheer lunacy
","Well acted and shot, this details the banality and surreal existence of the Fuhrer bunker in the closing days of the war. It shows the party-ing in desperation, compared to the fanatiscim of others, against the fantasy of control of the battles by Hitler, contrasted with scenes outside the bunker showing the reality of the collapse of the reich. Uncomfortable, but fascinating, viewing.",8,0,0,17 August 2018
12 Strong," Intersting story, dull film
","The story presented here is interesting - the story of how special forces worked with anti-Taliban forces shortly after 9/11. But there doesn't appear to be any tension in the battle scenes, or in the political manoeverings between the different allied commanders. the delivery of dialogue is generally emotionless, and there are few surprises. Its just hard to care what happens in the war or to the characters, which is a shame as there is an interesting story here, which isn't done justice, despite some good actors, and a decent budget.",5,0,1,1 December 2018
Arrival," Time bending thoughtful sci fi
","The film deals with humanity meeting with aliens, and how to communicate with them, but also deals with the nature of time, and how humanity needs to learn to co-operate more. All good themes, and all well played out and developed, especially as as the film progresses the earlier parts of it get called into question. This is an intelligent, slow burning film, but never dull. Things don't happen at a frenetic pace,but the story move along well. An underrated film",9,2,5,4 November 2018
Centurion," Fun historical action fantasy
","Loosely based on the story of the dissappearance of the ninth legion, the only thing historical about this film is the setting. And even then it takes a few liberties. So if you want a documentary loo elsewhere. However, this is a fairly fun action romp of soldiers cut off behind enemy lines and trying to survive and escape. Theres some daft plot points, but the action is well paced, and the fights suitably gory. Its not the most though provoking film, but it is a fun romp.",7,0,2,28 December 2018
The Greatest Showman," Uplifting eye candy
","I loved this film. Its a showy, unchallenging, fun movie with an uplifting simple message, and great catchy songs. The film has been criticised for being a white wash of the true Barnum story - but thats to miss the point. It has been recast to tell sell an inclusive message for today, it is not a documentary, and I have yet to see a depressing musical - they are by their nature intended to be upbeat and fun. Which means that nuances of history are skipped or left out. Whilst the criticisms may be valid, if you want a fun uplifting film watch this. If you want the real Barnum story - go somewhere else.",9,2,4,14 April 2018
300," Stylish fantasy
","Based on a graphic novel, the film is reasonably faithful to the comic, but the comic itself was a fantasy take on the battle and situation. So the film is stylishly shot but with little historical detail shown. For all that, it is incredibly well done and enjoyable as a spectacle, with some great battle scenes. But you won't learn much about the actual events.",8,1,2,28 July 2018
Annihilation," Not as meaningful as it tries to be
","This is a slow paced film told with flash backs. There are plot holes (why only small teams? Why is this team all females?) But that doesn't really detract from the film. Its visually quite impressive but overall incoherent. It borrows from various sci fi films - invasion of the body snatchers; 2001, Aliens - to a lesser or greater degree, but fails to touch any of them in terms of quality. It seems to be trying to convey some sort of idea about identity and who we are - but fails to come up with anything particularly significant and ends up just being interesting for its sci fi visuals, with no substance to back it up.",6,1,2,1 August 2018
True Romance," Tarantino at his best
","Great Characters, great dialogue, a great array of actors, and a fun filled, over the top story, well told.",8,0,0,7 April 2020
The Breakfast Club," Classic for a reason
","Reviewing this so long after it came out seems pointless, in some ways, but then my reviews are more of an exercise in memory than the work of a critic. The trope of this film is well known, and well worn. But though this film is almost 35 years old, it still works. Because this is all about the characters and the journey they go through togethor, rather than the setting, or the time its set. As such, it doesn't date too badly, and whilst much is predictable, its still a good emotionally engaging and fun ride.",8,0,0,27 January 2019
The Pursuit of Happyness," The Pursuit of money
","Its hard for me to like this film, as basically I distrust stockbrokers, as people who make money for nothing by gambling in ways which can, and does, destroy others lives when it goes wrong. So the happyness here is the pursuit of riches - which seems fairly shallow.
But Will Smith is excellent as ever, and the story has enough highs and lows to keep you engaged, even if the outcome is obvious. Well constructed, but hard for me to score higher.",6,2,2,27 October 2019
