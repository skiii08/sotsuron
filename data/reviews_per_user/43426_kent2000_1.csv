The Blair Witch Project," terrifying movie helped by top notch acting
","While the grainy look and jittery camera work help set the mood for this unconventional horror story, it's the flawless acting that really drives home the terror. These kids are superb. The dialogue between them, the arguments, the fear in their faces: never once did i see these characters as actors. I saw them as real people. And that made the film all the more engrossing. Add to that the final 5 minutes of the film, which for me, were the most excruciatingly terrifying moments i have ever experienced in a movie. Breathless edge-of-the-seat excitement!",Null,0,2,21 August 1999
