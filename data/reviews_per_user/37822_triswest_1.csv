The Hangover," Infectiously Funny
","The Hangover is one of the few comedies that manages to be funny all the way through. aside from the funniness (which points to the good writing and acting) it actually does a very good job at describing the experience of being that mashed and in that sense has a seriously good side too.do not watch it if you're easily offended. if you're not easily offended and you haven't seen it you have a treat in store. it's not necessarily a guy film either, a bit like Forgetting Sarah Marshall isn't necessarily a girl film- they are just both very funny films.Hangover 2 is out late May 2011 and i'll watch it for sure. if it's half as good as the first it'll be twice as good as most comedies.",9,2,4,7 April 2011
