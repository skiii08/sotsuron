Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Great intro to Star Wars!
","This movie has a lot of things going on below the surface. It has to set up it's own plot to resolve to feel like a self contained story. It has to set up the arch that is going to happen for the next three movies. And connect to what we've already seen. It effortly does them all.Another achievement from Lucas. This movie is the most important movie to come out in the last twenty years. It literally changed the way all movies were made. Nothing looked evenclose to this before. And CG characters hadn't been used like this by a long shot. And now you look at every movie and they have all changed their methods because of the cost effective CG this movie revolutionized.This movie is able to capture the spirit of the original Star Wars by keeping it light and fun without overtly copying A New Hope. A studio would do as many call backs as they could. This has nothing that could be a straight up call back. When the original creator is involved they can do this effortlessly because they are the Gods of their universe. Lucas is not only able to maintain Star Wars but also redefine what Star Wars is. This movie isn't created for nostalgia, Lucas is, as always telling a story. In a way this is much closer to his original vision. When you read his rough draft The Star Wars, it's very close to this.There are so many great scenes in this movie. Of course the lightsaber fight and the podrace are the two most disputed but I always loved the beginning with Obi-Wan and Qui-Gon sneaking around dismembering battle droids. Seeing a Jedi do what they do was a nice treat as well. Luke didn't know nothing. Anakin is great as well because he's nothing like we thought. He is the best kid that ever could be. Remember when we were all like that? So selfless and willing to help others? It's that love that hurts Anakin and saves him in the end. Without his love he wouldn't have created Luke and without Luke he wouldn't come back from the dark side.I think that the designs are the best in this movie. The characters, ships, buildings, costumes and interiors are all so cool in this. I can see why, after years of being restricted by practicalities Lucas is able to let his hair down and just go for it. And from a design standpoint and really story this movie had to look different from the originals. Not only is it 30 some years before but the galaxy is in a much different state than how we know it. The design has to reflect that so we know we're in an age of romance not industry.Qui-Gon is such a cool character. I love that he is a rebel of the Jedi and he's the reason that things to eventually work out. Without his maverick thinking things would have gone much differently.Darth Maul is a great representative of the Sith. We don't get to see too many in the movies so his archetype image is a good window into what we can assume the Siths of old looked like.Jar Jar is really a new type of character that really works well. 3P0 was as goofy as it got. His physical comedy is great and works in good contrast to the seriousness of the plot and everyone else. And I love that he can't help it. But he isn't there merely to relieve tension when things get serious. He goes away or isn't wacky when the plot is serious.
But he's not an idiot, he's really helpful, he's just county clumsy.I do like how inherently goofy the Gungans are just as a culture. They talk goofy and their leader Boss Nass is the goofiest of them all. Their technology is so cool. The under water energy shields an the deflector shields during the fight are awesome.I could keep going as I love this movie so much. But yes, great intro into what Star Wars is and can be.",10,4,5,6 April 2020
John Wick," Boring slaughter
","The story is pretty good. Keanu is good but I found it rather boring. The action scenes aren't exciting, it's just Wick killing a butt load of people with little effort. There's an occasional over the shoulder move in there but this is basically an unexciting massacre. The body count had to be close to 100.I grew up with a 69 mustang so that was fun to see. And the dogs death is handled with taste.",5,3,8,23 February 2020

"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"," Magical!
","This is a such a great movie, especially for kids. It's fun and exciting and draws you into the fantasy. But you don't feel like they're holding back for kids. This really ignited the innocent kid inside of me. Good to see technology catching up to the imaginations of writers so we can see these visions on screen.And that aside they did such a good job adapting the book it's kinda insane. The mood is perfect and they way they portray Aslan... Even his voice sounds like Lewis is describing Nesson. They didn't change much. Really in the book you don't see the final battle and in this you do because it's a movie and it works better.I remember when this came out atheist didn't want their kids to see this because of the Christian aspects. I'm technically an atheist, but I don't like to call myself one because I don't like associating myself those people or with any group for that matter. But this isn't going to make your kid Christian. The Adam and Eve reference is brief and in a movie so full of stuff that kids don't know what they're talking about this reference will be included in there. And if you are so atheist that you can't understand the good messages that come out of religion or you don't even want your kid to wonder if there is a God then I don't think this family movie is your biggest problem. I like that they didn't remove this aspect because that's what CS Lewis believed in and we should respect other points of view and artist integrity.All in all great fun for the kids and the kids in us.",10,1,1,27 March 2020
Public Enemies," Much better on a second watch
","I never hated this movie, but it felt like a missed opportunity, I kept waiting for the directors cut and I'm still waiting. But since this came to Netflix I figured I'd try it again and I was surprised. Really I guess the only problem was pacing? I don't know. A couple weird musical choices. Something seemed to be missing but I can't put my finger on it. A lot of things were very similar to Heat, of course that movie was based on this real event so they was unavoidable but as a movie watcher it was familiar.I'm a huge Michael Mann fan. Heat was my favorite movie before that became cool, I even love Miami Vice and The Keep. When I go into one of his movies I expect a game changer which this wasn't, but there's nothing wrong with that. I was impressed. I may watch it again. The shoot out in the woods is crazy cool. And I love how the muzzle flash lights up their faces when they shoot.I followed the development closely on this one, again huge Mann fan. When Christan Bale and Johnny Depp were announced I was excited. I'm not even a huge Depp fan but of course he's good and he's got the necessary presence for the role. And he was great. And arguably Mann has the best casting sense. You go back on his movies and so many people you saw for the first time are big now, or at least established. This movie was no different.If you weren't a fan the first time it's worth a second watch. If you hated it then I'm sure you'll still hate it.",8,1,1,22 May 2020
The Irishman," Honestly, it was nice to see a movie that wasn't PC
","Aside from everything being top notch in this movie, an unforeseen joy for me was seeing something that wasn't a board room movie. The story is told how it should be and cast just how it should be. There wasn't anyone forced unnaturally into the cast to fulfill a demographic. And that really helped the movie. I'm not racist or sexist in anyway but when the focus is on making a movie PC and not the story then the quality of the movie is going to suffer.And everybody picks up on this, including the people that they are spoon feeding to. Look at the recent PC board room movies that have come out: Terminator: Dark Fate and Charlie's Angels and they have bombed. People want good movies, not crap that thinks it's culturally aware.They need to return to this style of movie making, letting the director's make their movies and not demographics. I hope Hollywood is paying attention or else all of the high quality movies are going to be made independent from them.",10,7,10,29 November 2019
Terminator Salvation," Just stupid...
","Why Christian Bale?! Why?!The idea of being in the future was great. But instead of following through they tried too hard to make it tie into the old movies. Sam Worthington is such a terrible actor. He can't even keep an American accent for one scene.This movie was a waste of time, money, energy, resources even the exhaust of the cars and explosions.",1,1,4,19 March 2020
Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy," Great, but....
","By the time we got to the ending I knew what was going on but was a little confused as to how we got there. Other than that everything is top notch. The mood, the story, the characters, the cast and the plot are great. I'm not exactly sure where I got lost but when we arrived at the end I knew something had happened. I think the only other movie I was genuinely confused in was Godfather 2.",5,2,6,27 March 2020
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," The perfect ending to Star Wars.
","This is such a great ending to not only the first 3 but all 6. The empire is defeated, Luke becomes a Jedi, Han and Leah get together, the emperor's plan back fires and Anakin proves that he is the chosen one.The force does prevail but not how the Jedi thought. Anakin's 'mistake' is what makes him see the error of his ways when Luke is dying. Why? Because we see the world through our kids eyes. And Anakin is still there feeling empathy. If he didn't have kids he wouldn't have turned to the dark side. And if he didn't have kids he wouldn't have come back from the dark side. If he was able to express his love he wouldn't have had to hide his human nature and could have openly talked with friends and not turned to the dark side.Because Luke proves that love wins in the end. I wonder if Anakin's purpose wasn't just to kill the emperor but also to bring balance to the force by screwing up so the Jedi could go extinct so they could start fresh? Because they were going wrong as an order. I guess they always were by surpressing people's natural urges, as history has shown doesn't go so well.The three most innovative Jedi are the ones that break the rules: Qui-Gon, Anakin and Luke. Not to say that the Jedi are bad but they aren't doing things as well as they could, they are flawed. Their method created an opening for Anakin to fail, when in the end he was doing the right thing by falling in love.Luke doesn't listen to Yoda and Obi and goes to save his friends, which was the right thing to do. His love for his friends is the right choice. He delays his training but saving his friends does so much for the future. And he never wants to kill Vader, he couldn't and because his refusal to be an assassin and to trust that his father was still good he won. Because even if he killed Vader he wouldn't have killed the emperor and everything that he fought and suffered for would have been for nothing. Yoda and Obi are using Luke to kill Vader and don't want to tell him the truth. But the truth makes him do the right thing.It must be said that Mark Hamill did a great job in these movies. It kinda seems like he's not acting in 4 because he's so natural, but when you get to 6 you see how different he has become and that he was infact acting the whole time. He really transitions Luke very well and matures him nicely.I really love the Ewoks. They are the fiercest things in the Galaxy, only problem is that they're three feet tall. But that doesn't stop them. I really like how willing they are to help the rebels. A joke I read long ago that has always stuck with me is that they ate the Stormtroopers. Think about it there's helmets everywhere and they were going to eat Han and the others.The first half an hour is awesome because it's a little self contained story that is only about saving Han. Which of course you want to see. It's really a short on its own and a celebration of Star Wars really because no plot comes from it. We get to see our guys have an adventure of saving their friend. There's great monsters and action scenes.Jabba is great, so gross and evil. And such a work of art as well. So much work to get him alive, but it paid off because he's so real.The Emperor delivers in every way. You thought Vader was evil, no way, this guy is pure evil. And since 3 he has been living as his true self and his evilness is out in the open. I also love now that 3 told us that he has a lightsaber up his sleeve so during these scenes you know it's there.Just like with Revenge of the Sith there weren't really any innovations here, just perfection of what had been started with the first movie.The best change from the Special Edition for all 3 was the end song to this movie. The Ewok song was fine for an Ewok song but this new song really has such a reflective, end of the road, sad and happy feel to it. It feels like an ending, bitter sweet. It always pops into my head when something in my life is ending. It really says it all and nothing needs to be said because the music conveys the mood perfectly.A perfect end to the saga. You get everything that you want but it's not cheap.",10,1,1,16 April 2020
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Can we just stop counting this as Star Wars?

They don't care about George Lucas.Just because they own the rights doesn't mean that they can contribute to Star Wars. They own it in name only. You can like this as EU but it is not Star Wars.Star Wars isn't about space ships and nostalgia, it's about being new and original and having a story to tell that will help people's understanding of the world or themselves. Disney is making these for all the wrong reasons.Stop Disney from raping Star Wars and stop giving them the money to keep doing it.",1,107,209,21 December 2019
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," The most fun of all 6.
","The great thing with Lucas going back to his baby is that he can change the landscape of what it means to be Star Wars. And Attack of the Clones is the least Star Wars of all 6 episodes in the best way possible. It's the only one where nothing big is really at stake. There's no race against the clock and it's the lightest of all the movies. Which I enjoy greatly. This is the final outing before everything goes to hell in the galaxy.Not only does it take balls to set your movie 10 years after the first but it takes even bigger balls to change your main actor on the second movie. Even bigger than casting a 10 year old as your main character.We get to see the conflict of Anakin that was set up in 1. Those traits that made him a great kid work against him preventing him from making a great Jedi. And because he is torn from his instincts and his training he is conflicted.The thing about this movie is that in terms of plot not a whole lot happens. This movie sets up the plot that is about to happen in 3. And without this set up 3 wouldn't be as good as it is. For some reason I think about this movie more than the others. Something about the colors in the spring time or the cool set pieces or something.This is the most fun Star Wars, plot wise the least impactful but has some of the coolest scenes. Jango, the arena, Yoda fighting, giant clone war fight, Kamino... Everything that happens in this is really really cool and I can't get enough of it.Jango Fett is cool because we get to see more Boba like we always wanted. And we see him unasked without actually seeing him unmasked. Boba isn't ruined he is just expanded upon. The silver armor is as cool to Boba's as we can get. And the two guns are not only new to the movies but continue with the Western motif.Dooku it's cool because you didn't know that a Jedi could leave the order before. The archives are cool to see and of course the younglings are cool. As is seeing Yoda teach. This whole movie really gets into the details of Star Wars to show you how it all works.Also digital Yoda was new. Really it had to be done. The puppet looked bad in the release version of 1. All the other characters had become much more realistic then the puppet, he would have looked out of place. They were smart to not reinvent Yoda but just slightly expand what he could do so he still fits in with 5 and 6.The arena fight is great for so many reasons. But really the best part is that all these different story threads are out there and culminate in the arena. The clone war begins, Padme, because they're going to die admits her love for Anakin, Obi-Wan finds out Dooku's intentions... The fighting is amazing. Of course with something we've never seen before.It was strange to see the clones as the good guys because you know they end up being bad but you don't know how.The monster fight is cool, I love the Acklay. Then Mace shows up with, 'This party's over.'
Seeing all the Jedi fight was something we've always wanted to see. Then the war which has never been like this. The clones save the day for another surprise. Mace finally in action was a great joy.Anakin with two lightsabers and then of course the crown jewel: Yoda fighting. I do have to admit seeing this brought tears to my eyes. Not sure, of happiness or just pure sensory overload but it did. I knew going into the movie that he fought. Which I didn't think that he could and was kinda against at first. But of course it made sense, he's a Jedi. But he didn't fight in anyway that my mind could imagine. He fought in a way that only Yoda could. It was so awesome.Kamino is cool with the rain and ocean. The different parts of Naboo. The ground level of Courscant... This movie has so many cool things in it, I wanna go watch it right now!Funny thing about this movie is that there is a lot happening behind the scenes. Everything with the clones and Sidious. You have to really think about it. The pieces are there but you have to put them together yourself: After Maul's death Sidious recruits Dooku. Dooku orders the clone army using the name of a Jedi he just killed: Sypho-dias. Then he creates the separatists to create the issue of an army of the Republic. So when Obi discovers the droid army and the republic is scared of a defense, there is already a clone army just waiting around that they might as well use. Sidious wants the war to start to not only prolong his stay as Chancellor but to get his clones on every planet and the Jedi divided for order 66. Because you can't overthrown an entire galaxy overnight.The best part about this trilogy is that Lucas was telling a story. This wasn't fan service and you didn't get what you wanted because it would sell tickets. There was a story to be told and Lucas told it very well without rushing and cutting corners and realistically. Governments crumble from within before your eyes without the people knowing it. And this story does that.Star Wars never gets credit for being realistic. Like Anakin complaining about sand. I've never related so much to a Star Wars line!",10,6,8,8 April 2020
The Matrix Revolutions," Amazing conclusion to Reloaded!
","And of course the entire trilogy but since this is the second half of Reloaded it perfectly pays off what the first half set up and comes to a satisfyingly conclusion to the story of The One.The siege is truly amazing. The swarms of sentinels bursting in is so jaw dropping. The upsides down fight at the start. And of course the epic duel with Smith.I absolutely love where this story goes. We've seen so many of these epic series come to great ends and they usually do it the same way: an epic fight with the bad guys. I'm not knocking that but Neo stopping the war by making a deal with the machines to stop Smith, their common enemy just blew my mind. I did not see that coming and it made so much sense. Every action has a reaction. There's The One, brought to bring peace. Then the many, Smith, the opposite to Neo, the anti matter to his matter, created to destroy that's it. This deal couldn't exist without the One because he created Smith. And this deal ends the war. I loved it. And I love that they end the war but don't destroy the machines. Very realistic ending.Full of great themes. We need machines. Neo beats Smith with the help of the machines. Trinity's death is a very moving scene, the whispering was a nice touch and made it much more intimate. I love the machine God saying 'We don't need you, we need nothing!'I really liked following the secondary characters. They were good and the ground work was laid. And they aren't main so they could die, a lot of suspense. And I like how Z and the Kid meet up at the very end. Jada was great. I really like that character. Very tough and good.I could keep going and going. If you don't like this movie it's probably worth watching this and Reloaded closely together if not back to back. It is one movie.",10,5,6,25 February 2020
Man of Steel," So good!
","How people weren't into this is such a mystery. I loved everything about it. The only thing wrong is that the action scenes go on a little long but they're cool so it's fine. It's great to see Superman with a new spin after basically being the same for 70 years but still staying true to what he is.This isn't a Superman comic this is a becoming Superman movie, which we've never had before. He's usually young an then suddenly Superman. It's great to see him learning how to be Superman.I really like how SciFi it was. Because finding out an alien was on Earth would shake things up. Every other version people just see that a man can fly and basically accept it.",10,10,13,31 January 2020
The Shining," Not what I remembered...
","Saw this for the first time in years and it wasn't the movie I remembered loving. Every scene goes on far too long. The dialogue takes the longest way to get to the point. And every dialogue scene is only two shots and becomes very boring after a while.Many shots are very long and just cut after nothing happening. The suspense builds with nothing actually happening. Look at the first three shots of the movie, we only needed one of those. The shots are very boring too. Nothing interesting on terms of framing. And other than the Steadicam shots the camera hardly moves in an annoying way.Examples: when Jack is locked in the cellar and the ghost is talking to him, that scene could be half the length. That scene basically happens twice. Grady tells him what to do, Jack says he'll do it and then they repeat this again. When the wife looks at all of his typed pages. It just keeps going after the point has been made. The chase at the end goes on for so long and becomes redundant very quickly.The acting is all over the place. Every actor is in a different movie. Some people act like they're in a commercial and others act like they're in a horror movie. They're not bad, they're just in different movies.The script needed another pass at it and the movie needed another edit. I have not read the book and I used to love this movie.",1,1,5,5 January 2020
"I, Robot"," Not very good
","So many twist and turns that towards the end you don't know who to trust and lose interest. The humor was all really forced and didn't fit. The story is nothing new and we've seen it all too many times: Robots think humans are destructive and want to save them from themselves.The twist and turns could have been handled much better. When you think the owner of the robots is trying to take over the world for some reason it is stupid. When what's really going on is revealed it's much better but too much time had passed.Will's reason for hating everything about robots is dumb. Not trusting sure, but hating, I don't think so.Will is suddenly afraid of heights? He says something about the height of the scientist falling but it's not a set up.Will's robot arm was teased and not addressed for so long that I questioned if I actually saw it and was distracted from what was happening on screen because I was trying to figure out if Will was an advanced robot and wondered why he hated his own kind.The doctor killing himself because he knows that Will will investigate and figure this all out because he hates robots and piece all this together from finding a book was absolutely insane.",2,0,4,27 February 2020
Independence Day," So good and so bad
",When I was a kid this was the best thing ever. A few years later it wasn't. So full of cheesy and corny moments. Everything about this it good except for those things. If they weren't in here it would be a great movie.I want to like this but oh my God the cheese.,5,1,5,21 December 2019
Gone with the Wind," I know it's classic but it sucked...
","I of course fully acknowledge the achievement and contribution this had to movies but I didn't like it. Even as a fan of movies, including old movies. I'm a movie lover and I couldn't enjoy this. And I'm not criticizing this for being racist or anything. That's stupid not only considering when the movie was made but also the point of view of the story.Just as a movie my God! It's so unnecessarily long and doesn't go anywhere. At the end Scarlett doesn't change so why did it take 4 hours to go nowhere?This movie is untouchable to the point where everyone says what they're supposed to say about it instead expressing their own opinion. But I haven't meant anyone born after 1960 that actually likes this movie. Which is fine tastes change in society and movies can be important without being good, they're two different things. I wish people would stop lying that they love this movie.I don't know what was going on in the culture in the 30s where people loved seeing this movie over and over. Did they hate themselves? Maybe more Catholics were around and they wanted to punish themselves for their sins? I don't know.",1,0,1,15 May 2020
Get Out," It's good but calm down people!
",It's not amazing. It's a well done little thriller but it's nothing to go crazy over. I thought the set up and feel were well done but then the end kinda fell apart.They had this cool idea and approach and then the end just becomes your typical thriller ending. I felt like they didn't deliver on the promise that had been made with the first half. I don't know if they got lazy at the end and gave into convention or what but I was disappointed with the sudden lack of quality.And Allison Williams did not look believable holding a gun. She might be one of the best looking women alive right now but she obviously had no idea how to hold a gun. The damn thing probably weighed more than she did.,7,1,1,4 April 2020
1917," Boring! Boring! Boring!
",Boring as all hell. I've never seen a movie about such an exciting subject be so boring. The 'one take' gimmick hurt the movie. If this could have been edited with multiple set ups the movie could have been much better. After about 20 minutes of following behind people and time filler dialogue I really started to notice the real time format. I was really interested to see how they were going to pull it off. I am very interested in new camera work and story telling but this time it hurt the movie.When he goes up the hill in the woods forever I almost left. There was no reason for that. I'm sure Mendes was watching the movie during editing and wished he could make some cuts. Doing Rope as 'one shot' works and doesn't dictate the story. With this it dictated the story telling.,1,49,120,13 January 2020

Avatar," The horror.... The horror...
","Like everybody else I eagerly awaited James Cameron's return. And this looked like such an ambitious return at that. Then the movie started. Between the crappy narration, stupid story, terrible dialogue, awful writing and unoriginal everything I don't know where to start. Of course Sam Worthington can't act.Really the worst part about this is the writing. Everything that's said is dumb and the good actors try their best. The story is of course ripped off of Dances with Wolves. It would be one thing to take the basic idea, but this goes far beyond that. The main guy falls in love with the chiefs daughter, they fall in love while she's teaching him the language, he narrates the movie through writing his journal... I'm sure there's more.This story isn't worth telling, it's been done so many times: evil corporation, money, invading native culture... Yada yada yada.... We need something new not the same message. and it's really hard to believe that with how PC everything is these days that in 200 years all of that would be completely gone.Looking back on it the seeds of this started with Titanic. When Cameron used generic storytelling devices to get to his worlds. Titanic is original enough to work but this isn't. Also I'm sure after making the biggest movie ever that you're not going to hear a single criticism from anyone reading you script.The world is really cool looking. But since it's all fake I wonder why they didn't go for it and make something completely fantasy? The Avatars look like humans with makeup basically. If I was going to CG everything I would take advantage and really utilize the CG and make something that couldn't be a guy in a suit.But the worst part of all: Colonel badass. No subtly, over the top and borderline cartoonish. I don't know why he has a big duel with the main character at the end when they have absolutely no connection whatsoever.I guess everything in this is heavy handed. It feels like Cameron hasn't watched a movie since 1997 so he's taking the next step in 97 terms. Now we know why he wrote this so long ago, it was right after watching Dances with Wolves.I hope that Cameron just got lost in his love for the world and returns to the original film maker that he was.",1,0,1,23 April 2020
Sinister," I'm not a horror fan
","I like good movies and sometimes those happen to be horror. But I'm not a fanboy for the genre or anything that restricts itself to the rules of the genre.This movie was really good. A few jump scares but not overdone like a lot of scary movies. The fear comes from the story and not the anticipation of the jump.I saw this preview years ago and thought that it had a good premise. But given that it's scary and produced by summit and Blum that didn't bode well. Ethan Hawk helped to legitimize it though. He's of course a really good actor but I feel like he can be talked into doing anything so he's done some crap. But I like that he's not above anything.I was glad that the movie delivered on the good idea and made a good movie out of it. I normally don't like it when a good idea turns out to be supernatural because it feels lazy but for this story it works.There's something scary about footage through a low quality camera. Again, done very well here.It was very engaging and I had my eyes glued to the screen. It actually prevented me from drinking my hot beverage because I didn't want to jump and spill it.The only annoying part was the wife. It felt like if you married a true crime author that you wouldn't be mad when he did things that a true crime author had to do.",10,2,3,13 May 2020
Titanic," Very good
","I haven't seen this in a very long time. I have always been a fan. Looking back on it now it's not as good as it was then, but still very good. There are a million little dumb things that bother me but they're not real complaints. And maybe this is from seeing the movie so many times. I can tell you exactly where the first VHS cut off.The only real complaint I have is the modern day scenes, this whole story line doesn't need to be there. This is a long movie already and about a half an hour goes into this story that ultimately doesn't matter at all. I found myself not giving a crap about these scenes and just waiting to go onto the ship. And then when they come back saying, 'Oh yeah.' And not caring.And this story line really doesn't mean anything because she has the diamond the whole time and doesn't tell them, for some reason, throws it into the water, for some reason and then dies I'm assuming, for some reason. So having Rose tell the story in modern times doesn't amount to anything. The only thing about showing Rose older is to show that she lived a good life like Jack wanted but they don't really go onto that all that much.The best thing this movie does is make you feel for the people who were actually on the ship and do justice to what they went through. And does a really good job of including real people without making anyone look bad. You even see where the people who made bad decisions were coming from.",8,6,9,29 January 2020
The Matrix Reloaded," Much better the second time around
","I did not like this very much the first watch. But after watching Revolutions, which I thought was much better, I gave this another chance. The first time you are of course wondering where the story is taking you and it ends up being basically no where. Then Revolutions does go there.Because Reloaded is a second movie, it's the first half of the second movie. With that knowledge this first act becomes much better. Sure the action scenes go on a little too long, while they are very cool, but the second time when you aren't wondering about the plot you can enjoy them a little more.Maybe it would have be easier if they called this movie part one.My only problem with this movie is that it's uneven. There is over an hour of laying down plot line after plot line. Then action scenes that are very long and lose their significance to the story about half way through.Now all of the dialogue and action scenes are very good but there should have been a little bit of break up to make it easier on us and even it out. The last third corrects this problem though.Very good after a second viewing. The two movies are structured like one movie. It's really like watching The Empire Strikes Back, pausing it after Darth Vader shows up at cloud City and waiting 6 months to finish the movie.Please give it another chance and you will enjoy.",9,6,7,12 December 2019
The Disaster Artist," Great movie about bromance.
","And you don't need to see The Room first. It's not just a movie about a making of, it's about a friendship.I watched this right after watching The Room and loved it. It's funny, weird and touching. I went and read the book right after. The movie does a great job of adapting it and making it a movie. There are changes for sure, but the essence is there.If you loved this movie I highly recommend the book, it's much better, only because there's more of it. Tommy is so funny I laughed out loud many times reading it. The 'Hi, Mark,' scene has so much more to it. When asked what Tommy got his degree in he says, 'I study the psychology.' Tommy is a landlord to many places and has a giant key ring but doesn't label them so when he goes to his place he tries key after key until he gets the right one. Those are just a few...Franco does a great Tommy. And actually they make Tommy look a little better in this, in the book he's meaner at his worst.The thing that makes The Room so bad isn't that the acting is bad, or the dialogue is bad, or the set decoration is bad, or the story is bad, which it all is. It's really that the situations are so strange and bizarre. You've never seen a movie like this because even the worst Hollywood movie is going to be done by professionals and the script is going to go through a few filters. The Room has zero. You are seeing into Tommy's head. And it's weird. In Tommy terms all of this stuff makes sense, because this is how he sees the world.I made a short of my own and sat in a theater full of people watching my years and years of hard work so I really felt for Tommy during the premier. It hurt me to watch him. I knew that feeling. Fortunately people enjoyed mine, or at least they pretended to.",10,4,4,25 May 2020
"Hail, Caesar!"," Could have been great
","The movie starts off fine, good characters, good humor. Then about halfway through I realized that wherever this was going was taking way too long. All of the scenes are really good but there isn't any focus. After the long dance number in the middle my interest was lost for good.The Cohen's seem to be in this rut of trying to be themselves or trying not to be themselves or not like anybody else, I can't really tell. But there is too much trying on their part. Before they naturally wrote their movies and it seems that they are aware of the spotlight or something.Seems like after winning best picture that they've tried not to repeat that move? I don't know, that's an easy time to point at and say it happened here. But ever since then their movies have tried to be outside the box instead of naturally being that way. Buster Scruggs was good for the most part. I hope they find their passion sooner than later.",4,4,4,23 April 2020
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," My favorite Star Wars
","Not only is this the movie that we were all waiting for but it's also an absolute masterpiece. The story is tight and flows quickly with precision. And I think the biggest wow factor of this movie was what we had all been waiting for: how Anakin became Darth Vader. It was not a reason that any of us predicted or even could. But it felt right and natural. He became Vader because he thought he was doing good and not evil? What? And that's real stuff. Bad people don't think their bad, they think they're doing good.That's what is so good about this trilogy, it focuses on the grey of good and evil while the original trilogy focused on the black and white nature. It's a good contrast. I don't know about you guys but I've learned most life lessons from Star Wars and as an adult I was able to learn still.The opening is amazing. About a half an hour of the clone war. We don't see a lot of this war, so this half an hour really let's us see what it was like between movies. Also what it does is give us Anakin's and Obi-Wan's relationship. Because they don't share much screen time. This sequence shows their rapport and puts them through many life and death situations to show us how much they mean to one another. And R2 finally gets his day. Of course they don't realize that he's saving their skin. Seeing R2 destroy two super battle droids it's just greatThe end is again beyond what I thought Star Wars could be or even any ending to an epic series. Instead of the giant fights that have always ended these movies we climax with a duel. Two duels really but two duels! They are epic but still it's a personal climax. You don't need a huge action ending you need an ending that you're emotionally pulled into. And that's just what you get.The scene before the duel is the most powerful of all 6 movies. Husband versus wife and friend versus friend. Obi-Wan doesn't want to kill his friend but will as always to do his duty.And emotions cause Obi to be unable to kill his friend. But Jedi don't have emotions? Well maybe the Jedi aren't right. Mace is going to break the rules to do what's right. Anakin's repression of his emotions caused him to go to the dark side. He ignored them until he could be used by evil. Luke listens to love and it's that love that kills the Emperor. If he killed Vader he would have been unable to kill the Emperor himself. Again, the grey area of this movie. Luke doesn't pretend he doesn't have emotions, he learns to control them. This is where the Jedi mess up.You really get the sense that they're going all out on this one. All of the set pieces are as cool as it gets. General Grevious, the Boga, the Jedi star ships, the new clones, Wookies, even Obi-Wan's beard.And I can't stress how important Attack of the Clones is to this movie. It sets up Anakin's dreams with his mom. You saw that he was right in 2 so when he has the dream about Padme you don't question for a second that it's going to happen. If Anakin was able to respect nature and not try to change what he coveted his wife wouldn't have died. He wants to persevere what he wants so badly that he kills to keep it. But that's not how it works and because of his actions he loses it all.The clone war is an excuse for the Clones to be all over the galaxy so when order 66 is issued the divided Jedi can easily be killed and the emperor's soldiers are already enforcing his rule.We waited to see the Emperor show up and boy did he. His facial deformation was a nice surprise too. But I love him in this because he is the most evil he has ever been or ever will be. Because he has been hiding his true self for 30, 40 years? So he is really able to let his hair down and explode with evil. We get to see him fight with a lightsaber which is almost as cool as seeing Yoda fight. And then they get to fight each? Mind blown! I love the trash talking that happens between the two.Padme dying of a broken heat isn't some fantasy thing about love. People that are really sick really do die when they stop fighting and give up. She gives up.One of my favorite parts is when Obi is asking Padme where Anakin is on the veranda. He figures out who the father is and says, I'm so sorry.' Very cool.Other great part is when the Jedi council is talking about the Wookies and Yoda says that he has good relations with the Wookies. Your two favorite Star Wars things combined. And then when Yoda rides on Chewie's back.Two of my favorite parts show the genius of Lucas as a director. After the huge nonstop half an hour there is a little interlude with Grevious flying to Utapau. It's a cool little visual scene with killer music but as an audience it gives us a chance for our minds to take a break.The next 'breather' interlude is after Anakin does his murdering and the empire is declared and we get to see Anakin crying over what he has done while looking at the awesome volcano planet and the music swells to a great climax. After a lot of things have happened emotionally and plot wise we get a break.Another great choice from Lucas is to not show Anakin killing the young Jedi. I think that after seeing such an atrocious display of cold blooded murder, as an audience you wouldn't feel any sympathy for Anakin. There's a difference between knowing it happened and actually seeing it.I use this example of what comic relief is all the time. After the duel of best friends starts and a very emotional scene Yoda walks in to the Emperor's office. They move their staff's to strike and Yoda lifts a finger and throws them against the wall knocking them out. I laugh every single time. I saw this movie in the theaters a lot of times. Even more than what you think a lot is. And it got a robust laugh every time. It's comic relief where comic relief is needed. It's not a joke, it's relief. And for those of us who grew up and wishing the red guards were in the movies more and then they're finally in this one and they are finally going to fight and they don't. Very funny.When I walked out of the theater in 2005 I thought this was the best Star Wars and after almost 20 years my opinion has not changed and only strengthened. Hayden does a great job, as well as everyone else. Ewan fully becomes the Alec Guinness that he had been laying the ground work for two movies. This movie takes everything from the other 5 movies and builds upon them to go where no movie has gone before.You wanna know how good this movie is? It's so good that you forget that General Grevious was in it.",10,3,3,8 April 2020
X-Men: First Class," Possibly the best X-Men movie
","After X3 and Wolverine Origin our expectations for the X-Men franchise were pretty low if not gone completely. This seemed like a last ditch effort by Fox to make something out of X-Men. When pictures were being released I laughed at them with my friend. Beast looked weird and everything looked cheap. I went to the theater thinking, 'I don't know why I'm seeing this it's gonna be stupid.'What they made was so much more than a prequel. A lot of the times when these movies are made there only function is to explain why everything you already know came to be. This actually had a story to tell. And was the beginning of a great franchise. Casting was good. Even their self referential jokes were good.I don't know if Bret Ratner hated X-Men and was deliberately trying to ruin it but he did. Goddamn he did... So much that not only was the past the only place to go by the fact that they used time travel to correct this later on.They made the characters real, who we know but different. They aren't set in their ways yet. Magneto has his evil foundation but he's not there yet. Xavier isn't the teacher but it does come naturally to him. It's fun to see them young doing what kids do.The story is exciting and worth telling. A lot of really cool things happen. The 60s feel it's nice too.Little did we know then they this was the start of saving X-Men.",10,4,4,4 June 2020
Speed," Fantastic crap
","As a kid this movie was one of the best. As a grown up, one of the worst. It's everything that you hate about movies: cheesy, corny, stupid, predictable, dumb, formulaic, illogical, cliched, cheesy and more cheesy. But with that said, it does it very well. Great actors help, the story is also great but it's all wasted on this 'crowd pleaser.' It's an R rated movie for kids, which they don't make anymore. This is the movie my wife watches when she's sick. If she watches it when she's not sick, she doesn't enjoy it. It's a comfort movie.",4,0,3,7 March 2020
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Can we just stop counting this as Star Wars?
",Disney obviously just sees this franchise as a cash grab. They don't care about art. They don't care about story. They don't care about originality. They don't care about George Lucas.Just because they own the rights doesn't mean that they can contribute to Star Wars. They own it in name only. You can like this as EU but it is not Star Wars.Stop Disney from raping Star Wars and stop giving them the money to keep doing it.,1,13,16,18 November 2019
The Matrix," Truly incredible
","I have a long history with this movie of hating it. It came out at a time when Kung Fu was taking over action movies which I didn't like. I wasn't a fan of the slow mo and the style of this movie. So when this changed movies my hatred was only reinforced.Fast forward twenty years where I've learned to love Kung fu and tolerate slow mo. The Matrix was added to Netflix and since it was free I decided to give it another shot and absolutely loved it. Still not a fan of the style but it doesn't ruin the movie. I of course see how it's cool, it's just not my thing.This is one of the best written movies ever. The way the story unfolds is genius. Because you are getting a lot of information from what is the matrix to it's origin and it all flows very naturally. Very hard to do. The concept is genius and brilliantly executed. They really explore every aspect of this world and utilize it well.Keanu... I used to think he was awful. Watching this now I don't think that. Sure he has a few not great lines, enough to pounce on for a hater. But he is really good. He is very subtle. Something only a confident actor can do. Which the teenage me couldn't pick up on.I have gone on to watch the other two and loved them and now am a huge matrix fan and have watched them many times since. Reload took me two watches to realize what the brothers were doing, one movie split in two.It's fun to discover this movie now because they don't make them anymore. Big budget, ambitious movies. I miss them and hope their return is around the corner. Hopefully Matrix 4 will remind everyone what a good movie really is.",10,0,0,18 February 2020

Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," The most important movie of all time
","Who would have thought that an experimental director would have had to resurrect classic hero story telling? Well, that's where they were in the 70s. And Lucas did it with such perfection. He did his research and he cared. And most importantly he was trusted to make the movie that he wanted.A New Hope is the greatest successes story in Hollywood not only because it changed movies and made a lot of money and continues to touch people to this day. But because nobody believed in Lucas. Alan Ladd Jr at Fox and Mark Hamill were about it. Not only that but this production had everything go wrong with it. It was literally against all odds from everyone including the studio. Then it was a smash hit of unheard of proportions.Once a teacher of mine asked if movies were more than movies. And he said, 'look at Star Wars, yes they are.' And he wasn't even a fan. This is more than a movie because it speaks to people in a way that can't be described. They've tried but no one can. It's something that you feel because Lucas updated the hero myth. He took what worked in stories from all around the world since the dawn of time and made it his own.And he's really good at making movies. I think really the biggest contribution to movies overall isn't the special effects and the return to good versus evil storytelling. It's that Lucas really cares about how quickly the movie flows. He doesn't keep things that hang and everything is always moving. Movies became much faster after this. Because Lucas really focused on the pace and feel.Out of all 6 movies this one can stand
alone, as it was intended, well not intended but it was equipped to be one movie. As a fan this was always the worse of the original 3 because the next two were better. But when I got older and saw the movie proceeding this I understood it. After the French Connection and Dirty Harry and The Godfather and so many others, which are all good but I finally saw why Lucas wanted to make this. And the movie clicked for me and I loved it much more. Fun, simple, fast and good vs evil.This movie really does everything right. Every time I watch it I'm excited and laugh at every joke. It's an uplifting movie that many have tried to duplicate and are either too much of this or that.We talk about the influences for this but that's not what makes it so good, it's Lucas. While themes and motifs are taken from other sources there really isn't anything that is directly from something else. He took those ideas and made them his own. He knew how far to go, where to stop. Because Lucas has always shown restraint.I wonder what people will think when they watch them in Episode order? Where's the Emperor? Where's Yoda? Who are all these new people? Why is Vader hardly in it?Anakin is now pathetic. He always was but we never realized it. Grand Moff Tarkin is his boss. Vader takes orders from him. He is just doing what the Emperor tells him to do. It's funny that he became such a pop culture icon of evil. That was never the intention. I love James Earl Jones voice in this one because it's much more angry and sinister that the other two.I love when Wedge blows up the Tie then flies through the flames. I'm glad Lucas changed this for the special edition because I was always confused as a kid there.The music... My God the music! John Williams is always great and all 6 are great but this one in particular is the best. Especially during the last fight. Just think of it with other music and it's totally different.3p0 and R2 bickering is so funny. And Alec Guinness really helps bring weight to the history in the movie. Something about his warm presence really adds a lot to the movie. He makes it so seem real.But I have to say my favorite scene and I don't know why. Maybe because you can boil Star Wars down to this one moment. Is when Luke and Leah swing across the chasm. The music, the guy holding the girl, the adventure, the romance... Something about it gets me every time.As a kid Star Wars was dead. I was born in 85 and that was the lowest year of Star Wars popularity. So this wasn't shoved in my face. My dad showed me the movies because they were PG. There were no adds, none of my friends were into it. But I loved it and was obsessed. No influence from any where. That shows you the effect it has on a kid. It did in 77 all the way till now and it will forever.Lucas made something that speaks to not only kids but the kid in all of us. I can't tell you how many times I site star wars to distinguish between right and wrong. And my lessons haven't stopped, they continue with age. Lucas is the Midi-chlorian that shows us the force/this side of ourselves. I really wonder where the world would be without Star Wars",10,2,3,12 April 2020
Cloud Atlas," Mind blown
",I just finished it and extremely enjoyed it but my mind hasn't wrapped around the entirety of it. Nice to see a big ambitious movie. Felt like I was watching something from the 70s.A large story that is genuine and doesn't thrive on the 'just because' logic that so many small movies do. I can't wait to watch it again because I know there's so much more to get from it. And a nice surprise to see that Halle Berry can act. Also very nice to see Tom Hanks pushing his acting to the limits.,10,3,6,24 February 2020
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," The snow movie!
","That's what I called this when I was too small to reach the movies in my house. My poor mother had to decipher that description.Just as important as A New Hope was to movies, Empire Strikes Back is to sequels. And why? Because Lucas paid for this himself. No one has ever been in his position before. To make huge movies that are financed by the creator. No studio would ever allow a movie like this, it took risks: It's not a rehash, its darker, a realistic puppet was a serious main character and a lot of the story is left in the air.But while this movie is darker than it's predecessor it's not a dark movie, its just darker. People seem to forget that. It's a more serious story but it's still able to maintain the fun feel of 4. It also continues the speed from 4 as well. Instead of getting in huge fights they are just small scuffles. This doesn't feel for a second that it's trying to outdo the original. The story and the characters are expanded and deepened.Yoda was a huge risk, it's hard for us to think of a puppet not being taken seriously, but no one had ever attempted to make a life like puppet before. And sequels weren't a sure cash in either. In order for this movie to break even it had to be the most successful sequel of all time. It's these things that Lucas gave us. He not only knows how to tell a story and make a great movie but he takes risks to do it at the same time. He did this his whole career. If this movie failed not only was Star Wars dead but so was Lucas' career. That'll motivate you.My favorite SW set is in this, the carbon freezing chamber. I don't know if it's the steam, the orange light or the vastness but I love this room. Everyone looks cool here. Especially the Stormtroopers, their white really illuminates the orange well. And you get Vader and Boba in here too.The snow troopers are very cool. I can't figure out if I like them or the Episode 3 clones best.Lando is a great addition because he's the Han that could have been. And Lando gets crap for being bad but he really does make the best call. He appeases Vader to save his life while still giving himself the freedom to save Han in the end. And he hasn't seen Han in years maybe he's become a real , the last time he saw him he was a smuggler after all. And Billy Dee is great, I don't know if anyone is as effortlessly smooth as this guy.3P0 in pieces is a great addition that provides endless jokes.I love Han's love story with Leah because she's given him no indication that she's interested. And he acts like they have this dating history. But he is right because she does want him.And the best part of the movie: Yoda/training. Not only is Yoda the most powerful Jedi of all but you hang on his every word of wisdom. Lines repeated for my entire life. I have always loved the fact that the most powerful Jedi was the smallest. There's just something about that idea that really gets me.And there's really something to be said for the fact that Yoda is not actually real. We all know that Frank Oz did the voice and puppeteered Yoda but the fact that Yoda is not actually real really helps to make his character real. it's not necessarily Frank Oz as Yoda, what you see is the little green puppet as Yoda. There aren't pictures of him at studio 54 or news of him getting married. Yoda is Yoda. when he is not being the puppet on screen he doesn't exist which really helps to his reality.The biggest complaint since Lucas finished the saga was that 'I am your father,' is now not a surprise any more. Which is true, you do know, but watching them in order you'll probably be surprised that Anakin turns to the dark side. And it might be a surprise that Vader tells Luke this because as far as we know Vader doesn't know who Luke is. He doesn't even know that he has a kid. And we think that Anakin is dead. I don't know... Only time will tell with people who watch these in episode order",10,1,1,14 April 2020
Alien: Covenant," This is why you don't listen to fans!
","They don't know what they want and they're going to hate everything they see the first time only in a year later on a second viewing, love it.Prometheus was an amazing movie. It was original and Ridley Scott fully jumped back in with his return to sci-fi to give us something on par with Alien and Blade Runner. And you goddamn nerds ruined it because the alien wasn't in it? Who cares!? Did you see that there was an actual movie being made that had a real story to tell?No you didn't because all you do is go into movies expecting to recapture nostalgia then you go on the internet and feed off of each other's hate and ruin the future of the next movie. That's why George Lucas retired and that's why Ridley gave into what you idiots wanted to give you exactly what you asked for. And you still hated it!The movie was fine as a 'Alien' movie. But as a sequel to Prometheus it was terrible. So much was set up in that movie and in this it wad all dealt with off handedly with a flashback because you stupid nerds didn't like Prometheus.One of Ridley Scott's strengths has always been to make a movie that the studio can like and that can be original. He's very good and adapting to corporate demographic desires while still being an artist. I don't know how he does it but he's very good at walking that line.He wanted to make fans happy so he read all of your stupid 'follow the leader' comments and made a movie based off of that. I really don't blame him. But I wish that even Ridley wouldn't give into the uncreative, nerd mob.",5,4,5,12 May 2020
