Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," HIGh FIvE!
","funniest movie I've seen all year, maybe funniest movie in the past 2 or 3 years! My body was hurting after laughing so much at some of the skits and some of the things Borat would do. This isn't a movie for everyone, if you are easily offended, don't even try it. If you are a fan of the Borat character in any way, you will be loving it all the way through, most of the things he does in the Ali G show, he does here but shows no remorse for anyone he comes to meet. You should not watch it if you are a Gypsie or a Jew because he just tears them a new one in this movie. (Even though he is Jewish himself) You know there will be like an Un cut version on DVD when it comes out and I will be in line to pick it up HIGH FIVE!",8,1,6,5 November 2006
Juno," jason reitman did it again
","first was thank you for smoking then this gem... JUNO this was a very surprising little movie... well i don't know if you can call being the #2 movie in America little, but for an independent staying above some of the Hollywood big budget movies, its holding its own... actually its winning in some areas! like story, acting, directing, etc. reitman surprised me with thank you for smoking and i went into this thinking i would enjoy it and i did. maybe one of the best movies of the year so far. jason bateman surprised me with his great acting here and he gave the scene stealing performance of the movie, every scene he was in, he stole in my opinion. everyone else did what i expected of them, jennifer garner was alright, but in my opinion she was the weakest link in all of the actors... she got alittle annoying during the whole thing, maybe that was the point. my review goes well on the acting, directing, story, script, and overall i give it a 9. top 5 of 2007-08 so far!",7,3,11,12 January 2008
Zodiac," very very very very very good
","this was probably one of the best movies of 2007, it was very well done. some people would say it was slow and dull but i beg to differ, it was very captivating and thrilling. especially when there wasn't a whole lot of killing in the second half to keep the audience interested. it kept my attention the whole way through, especially after other viewings of it. it explained a whole lot but never lost me in trying to put the puzzle together to try and catch the killer. there were some intense scenes and some creepy scenes, all in the calling card of David f. here! the acting is what did it for me too. jake g. was actually very good, robert d. was good as usual, mark r. was good, everyone of the main characters was great",9,1,2,12 January 2008
American Psycho," great performance by Bale
","When i first saw this movie, i didn't know what to expect, and after viewing it, i was confused and didn't know what to think. Was it a slasher movie? was a comedy? was it a horror movie? what did i just see. I read up on it some and found out that it was mostly a satire about the economic boom of the 80s rightly called 'reagan-economics' and what one man goes through when he really can do anything he wants because he is so powerful and rich. It goes into things like respect of women and how men in the 80s cared more about what they wore, the way they looked and the music they listened to more than ever. Batemans rant about Phil Collins and his music right before he doubled up on a pair of hookers should go down in cinema history. Christian Bale gives a stellar performance here. Every time i see him in a movie now days, i just think back to American Psycho as his really star making performance. If you want to see someone put on an acting clinic, check out his performance. Fans of the book, should be happy, i haven't read it but i hear from people that have, say it is more like the book than not like other movies that are based on books. If you are a Bale fan you will be greatly pleased as this is the movie that he will probably be remembered for, also Batman Begins, but thats another story.",8,1,2,15 November 2005
No Country for Old Men," more movies like this PLEASE!
","maybe the movie of the year... 2007 and 2008?? could be. this was a very impressive movie that delivered with all the hype it was getting, people were saying this was the best coen brother movie yet and all this and that. i don't know if its the best coen brother movie, but its quite up there. maybe top 3. it just depends on what kind of coen brother movie you want. a fantastic film, a great cat and mouse thriller with great performances by both the main characters. especially the wild haired hit-man with the silenced shotgun and the air hose gun thing. the scene in the convenience store with the guy flipping the coin was maybe the scene of the decade, pure gold. tommy lee jones was usually great, its about time he did a coen brothers movie. no music at all i don't believe, and if you can pull a movie off without music then you have really done something and this did! ill have to watch it again to fully understand it, maybe read the book. but easily a top 3 movie of 2007-08!",8,0,5,12 January 2008
Batman Begins," best movie of 2005! Best comic book movie ever!
","all i can say is go and see it!!! it is the best comic book movie ever made!! i dare anyone after seeing this film to name a comic book movie better than this one!! This IS better than the original Batman!! everything is there, good script, good directing, excellent acting, excellent everything. This is now in my top 5 all time favorite movies. Christian Bale is now the definitive Batman and anyone that wants to take it, has to take it from him. I cant say anything bad about this movie, except it was too short!! (it is 2 1/2 hours) Batman fans will be glad to see a real batman movie and not one with George 'ER' Clooney and his nippled suit! The pacing was great, never boring at all, never checked my watch or anything like that. Best movie of 2005!! and Best Comic Book movie EVER! I cant wait to go and see it again and again!! PS- when you see it...at the end...there is a VERY COOL Surprise!! not going to give it away...but see it just because it has my vote for best movie of 2005!",9,3,4,15 June 2005
I Am Legend," DARK KNIGHT did it for me... this didn't
","The dark knight trailer at the beginning was better than this whole film combined. it just was slow and had about 3 or 4 good thrilling spots in the film that i enjoyed but everything else was dull and questionable. it left me with a whole lot of questions that didn't get answered and i don't like that if i am more confused to end the movie than before. I'm just glad it was only like 1hour and 40 mins. Will smith did well for basically being the only star in the movie, but there is still more things missing that he cant fix by just taking off his shirt and working out for all the women to see!! like i said before, i could of walked out after the dark knight trailer and been happy. this just didn't do it for me, for all the hype it got.",6,1,3,12 January 2008
Dumb and Dumber," my all time favorite comedy!!
","To this day, no other comedy has hit me like this one, it is my all time favorite and its not one of those all time favorite comedies, then out of nowhere there is a new all time favorite. This one is the king of the mountain until another comes along to knock it off and going on 11 years there is still no other. The writing, acting, everything to make a classic comedy was here. Carrey gave us the role of his career, that he will always be remembered for. The real surprise here is Jeff Daniels, he comes from mostly dramas and other genres but not comedy but he pulls this role off to a perfection. This also will be the role everyone remembers him for. So, 2 iconic characters were defined here. There aren't that many movies you can say that about. From the gags to the pranks to the downright stupidity of the characters, this is a classic hands down. There isn't a scene in this movie that isn't well known by the people who have seen it. From the opening scene where Lyoid ask for directions to the ending scene where they turn down a job oiling down models, there is not 1 scene that isn't memorable. Some of my favorite scenes are: the snow ball fight, the Dante's atomic pepper scene, the dinner preparations scene, the Jeff Daniels bathroom scene, the Sea Bass scene, the urination in the Beer Bottles, Carrey's dream sequence, the 'Mockingbird' singing scene, The apt. scenes, When they find the money scene, the airport scene, the Pete bird scene (his head fell off), the crying like girls watching TV commercial scene, both of them driving into Aspen on a motor cart. The great part about this movie, is about friendship and all the ups and downs friends go through on a trip like this. Its something you should watch with friends. If you look at it as a whole, its actually a heart warming movie about something sacred like friendship and thats something no one should ever mess with. The Farrelly Brothers best movie.",10,0,2,6 March 2005
Major League," the best baseball movie??
","In my opinion this is the best baseball movie out there. Sure there are others (the natural, the babe, field of dreams, etc.) but this one had it all. Put it this way, it had everything all the good baseball movies had in it plus alittle extra. It had great acting (Berenger, Sheen, Snipes, Bernson, Haysbert, Russo, Gammon, etc.) they were all spot on with their characters and some will never live down their characters here. The story was intriguing one as well, the basic story is this 'evil' GM of a terrible baseball team, and of course its a woman, is trying to get the team to loose all their games so she can move the team to Miami and out of Ohio where she hates being and replace the current players with better 'personel' Along with that story, there is kind of a love triangle with Berenger/Russo/and her new man. This doesn't take over the main story though and its good it doesn't stray far from what it is, a baseball movie. It is good to have other side stories as well to keep the pace of the movie going: Cerano having trouble with the curve ball and the old pitcher that gives him crap about being into Voodoo. Rick Vaughn having trouble with seeing, his temper, and his control. Willie Mayes Hayes trying to show off his 'hit like Hayes, Run like Mayes' style, and Roger Dorn with his trouble trying to keep his self clean of any injuries and trying to cleanly field a ground ball. All these side stories get played out very well and they help the 2 main story lines keep the pacing of the movie very sharp. The script was sharp as well, a lot of baseball jargon and quick witty dialog, I think some was ad libbed by some of them and the comedic timing was right on. If you are a baseball fan you cant NOT like this movie and you should get chills like I do every time I see the final game and the finale of the film, very emotional and a great ending. The finale might of just made this one of, if not the best baseball movie ever made. Like I said before you aren't a baseball fan if you didn't like this movie! plan and simple.",9,0,1,12 March 2006
The Dark Knight," Bob Kane would be so proud!
","this masterpiece was so much more than a batman film, it was clearly one of the best 'crime-thriller-action- drama' epics. One of the movies in my list of 'best in the last 5-10 years.' Far and away the best comic book movie ever made. Heath Ledger was awe inspiring as the maniacal, psychopath Joker. If you ever wanted to know how the joker was suppose to be played, watching Ledger is basically a character study on how it's done. That character is crazed and demented but at the same time he will get you to laugh at the things he is doing. Ledger was everything I could ever want out of the joker and Jack Nicholson's performance NOW seems more like a Ceasar Romero Joker of the 1960s. Aaron Eckhart was just as good as Harvey Dent /Two Face, his transformation from one to the next was so well done. Christian Bale was once again spot on as the Caped Crusader. I loved every part of this cinema masterpiece, there was nothing really flawed about it, everyone was on their A game, and that puts it among my all time favorites. One for the ages! Bob Kane would be so proud!!",10,3,7,18 July 2008
Saw," a low budget thriller genius
","this movie along with many others proves that you can make an entertaining thriller that audiences can enjoy without the 100 million budget, if your into movies like this. It was only made for like 1.5 million dollars and it grossed 50 mil in the US alone and i think another 50 mil overseas. It is a graphic thriller that pits 2 strangers in a cellar somewhere and they are forced to play this game from this serial killer named Jigsaw and they only have until a certain amount of time to complete each of their task or both will be killed. It is a cool concept that teaches the victims the value of life, not like all these other serial killer movies. The little ventriloquist puppet was a freaky looking thing. The movie has some cool flashback scenes to tell the story (or lack there of) of the Jigsaw killer and how he captured the 2 guys stuck in the cellar. As the movie goes along you start to understand more and more about the detectives that chase the killer, the Jigsaw killer himself or herself, and the 2 main characters stranded in the cellar, you find out why he/she chose them. There are Hitchcock moments and many twist and turns but not so many that you don't know whats going on. If you like 'Se7en' you will like this one. It reminds me more of the Christopher Lambert movie 'Resurection' but most people haven't seen that movie so...",8,0,1,27 February 2006
