Black Swan," boring......
","OK, keep in mind that i took my 80 year old Mom and my 20 yr old daughter to this movie, which i would not have done if I'd known it had a masterbation scene and lesbian action! Besides that, the movie was way too slow moving-now I remember why I don't like the Ballet-it's boring. I kept waiting for the scary stuff which didn't even happen til near the end of the movie. Meanwhile, we didn't know what was real and what wasn't and my Mom and daughter were totally lost. This movie could have been a lot better, there was just too much of the nambypamby good queen in it and we'd all been better off without the sex stuff. So, in retrospect, i wish we'd gone and seen anything else.",4,2,8,20 January 2011
