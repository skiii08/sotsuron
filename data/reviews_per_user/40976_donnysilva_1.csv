Hereditary," Gabriel Byrne didn't deserve this!
","I believe that Gabriel Byrne was chosen for this role for having participated in two great films of the genre 'Stigmata' and 'End Of Days'. The film is slow, the script is confusing and the cast does not shine. Do not waste your time.",5,1,3,21 August 2018
