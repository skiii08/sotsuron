The Avengers," Really,It's a invincible movie
","This movie is very nice.It's a action and fantastic movie.And used special effects in the film. A lot of Hollywood stars plays film.They are very good actors.Movie's superheroes Iron man,Thor,Hulk,Captain America and two agents.And the film's bad hero Loki.Loki wants to conquer the whole world.And he has an army.Loki has a box.This box is pure energy and is very powerful.This box is very strong.Superheroes wants this box.And they wants to save the world.I think,The Avengers is better than Twilight.Because,Twilight is very boring.But The Avengers is very amazing and creative movie.Hulk and Iron man is my favorite heroes.They are very durable,strong and interesting.I would recommend this movie to everyone.",9,0,4,27 March 2013
