Come and See," Feeling vs unfeeling
","The film follows the mounting mental anguish of a fresh boy soldier in the face of the atrocities of war  his face steadily more haggard as horror piles upon horror. There is a mix of familiar Tarkovsky elements: the child's embroilment in war; the forest as a kind of Eden, the cabin home of childhood, burning buildings. The best parts come early on during some beautiful lyrical moments in the forest  showering in a rainbow, the dance on the box, and inside the cosy little fir-branch shelter which goes down among my favourite movie scenes of all time  the stork looking in was inspired. And his voice goes hoarse after the bombing  how intelligent - only the Russians could have done that. The largely ambient soundtrack in the second half of the film (to reflect the boy's temporary deafness) coloured the madness of it all by means of sound  a brilliant concept done to astonishing effect. And yet... I wasn't completely convinced by it all. It was over-dramatised in places (the burnt man's speech, for example, and the boy's face was contorted with insanity a bit too often)  a more restrained approach might have been more effective. And I was sorry when the ditsy Glasha disappeared because she really had something. The relentless depiction of the German army as a travelling circus of drunks, whores and eccentrics was superficial and smelt of propaganda... another superb film marred by the Soviets. Let's not suppose the Nazis were the only ones to have burnt villages. The Russians themselves had been committing pogroms like this for decades, and had done the same to non-Jews in their civil war (remember Dr Zhivago?).The reverse-montage at the end also didn't work for me. There were deeper questions to be asked here, not simply about Hitler's childhood, but about humanity in general. The veneer of civilised behaviour is only skin deep. These events were not in the distant past but within living memory. Don't suppose for a moment that it was the fault of one man, that it can't happen again, that it is not happening somewhere in the world right now - that barbarity is not somewhere deep inside all of us.The killing of the cow? Well, it's silly to want your sensibilities spared in a film like this. Thankfully, it wasn't gratuitous.",Null,0,1,19 December 2008
50 First Dates," Nice film with stunning ending
","It's been interesting reading the other users' comments on IMDb. A lot of people have their prejudices: 'this turns out to be typical Sandler', or, 'this is not what we want from Sean Astin', or, 'Rob Schneider - yuck!'. Seems that many have their own ideas how the film should have been before they see it. I rarely watch these spongy Hollywood comedy/romances so I had little in the way of expectation (I didn't even know Rob Schneider was in it till I saw the credits at the end, nor did I know that Sean Astin had been in the Lord of the Rings as I have studiously avoided seeing those films). Probably as a result, I thought both Schneider and Astin were great. In fact, Schneider and his kids were hilarious in every scene. The scary thing is, if I'd known it was Rob Schneider beforehand I might have judged him more severely. Don't ask me why, that's psychology folks, but it shows how difficult it is to be objective sometimes, and it certainly paid off to approach the film without any prejudice.Anyway, the story is engaging enough - it even makes you think a little: what would it really be like to wake up each day and not remember the recent past? You know how sometimes you wake up and wonder where you are (or who you are)?... it's not totally unrealistic (as opposed to Groundhog Day, which was just fantasy) but not totally serious at the same time. Drew's performance - a bit silly, a bit serious - was in perfect balance, and this balance between silly/serious was echoed throughout the whole film quite successfully. Some people have criticised the use of cute animal characters, but Sandler has to play it straight for most of the time, and the animals (plus Schneider) provided the necessary balance. Very nicely done, I would say.A slight feeling of repetition in the middle is the film's only real flaw, but any weakpoints are forgiven by the time we reach the stunning ending. Stunning is not too strong a word - I don't think anyone was expecting the final scene, in which the story - and Drew - provides a very satisfying, beautiful and thought-provoking moment that will (if you are a person of reasonable sensibility) stick in your mind for some time. This final scene was marvellous in the way it captured and tied up all the elements of the story very quickly and with just a little low-key dialogue - with Drew, in fact (and understandably) being lost for words. To imagine this scene being repeated every day is fairly breathtaking.Recommended.",Null,2,3,15 August 2004
North by Northwest," Go ahead, vote me down
","My favourite film at age 10, I watched it again with mounting dismay. The whole thing now looks badly dated and Cary Grant is just too old and stiff for the part - his mother looked like his younger sister. Cotton or Holden would have done it better. The romance scenes are just horrible, and Hitch was never any good at comedy. The Technicolor (or whatever process it was) turns Grant's face bright orange and Eva Marie Saint's face bright pink, which is quite startling when they are in a clinch. Hermann's score helps but it's only James Mason who redeems things - he only has to speak to raise the quality a notch. But to be brutally frank, nothing was really working. The tension failed to mount. What action there was was arthritic. The gf actually fell asleep during the crop-duster scene - I kid not. Towards the end, the DVD jammed terminally, but I didn't mind. By then only the inertia of overfamiliarity was keeping me going. Sad, really.",Null,2,10,19 December 2008
The Battle of Algiers," No perspective
","A fairly detestable film. The people and the circumstances are unutterably paltry - guerilla thugs against army thugs at the fag end of colonialism. History is far bigger than all this. Did the Algerian people stop to consider the legitimacy of the Arab invasion centuries earlier, not even feeling a slight twinge of irony about their heroic revolution? Nobody can claim the world should retain the status quo of a particular point in time (except the hapless individuals who get trodden on). Flux and reflux of people has moved the world forward for aeons. Morality lies in the treatment meted out by the victorious forces, not necessarily in the act the occupation itself. Here we had our faces pressed too closely into the lives of individuals and their self-inflicted pain, pride and anger. And what did it earn them? The right to suffer decades more of authoritarian rule and civil war at their own hands.Nor do women generally go bombing milk bars full of children - that reduced the 'revolution' to the level of criminal psychosis and skewed things too melodramatically, just like the pile-up in 'Weekend' is hardly representative of a day out. The director was zooming in too closely and the picture was distorted simply by that.I also felt manipulated by the documentary approach and the grainy black and white which creates a disingenuous world view. The sky is still blue, the trees still green, people are still people despite any amount of film-processing. Certainly, carnage was involved, but I was resisting the the snapshot that the film presented of the world. Mainly though, seems to me that the point of any film is to invest morality and compassion in things, not strip them away for barren effect. The effect was of filming a real cock-fight, with the director secretly relishing the sight of the animals tearing each other apart but throwing his hands up and saying 'hey, I make no judgement, it happens' I don't call that accomplished art.",Null,0,0,6 June 2010
Collateral," Treats us like morons
","There was a lot of clever talk in the beginning, which was good, and they should have kept it that way. But before long the movie inevitably sold its soul to the usual Hollywood idols: guns and cars. What is it with movie producers and guns and cars? This could have been a great movie if it had kept up the tension in the talking rather than the usual childish blasting and crashing about. And funny how Tom Cruise's gun was made to sound so much louder than everyone else's...If you start to think about this movie for just a few seconds the whole thing falls apart. Cruise just doesn't look like a guy who can scythe his way through a crowd of bouncers in a nightclub, nor did his character seem like a guy who would think that such a ridiculous thing is necessary in order to take someone out, but he does look like some edgy guy who can do a lot of talking, trying to rationalise what he's doing. More of that sort of thing would have helped paper over the incredible holes in the plot. Hey, don't even start thinking about the plot for a moment, absolutely none of it makes sense. Like how could Vincent with a single blow of an axe cut off the power in an entire office block, including the telephones? - and why did he have to do that anyway...? Nor did Vincent's inane philosophising about Darwin and I Ching - two diametrically opposed concepts - make sense. I can only suppose we weren't supposed to be intelligent enough to worry about that.Well, Cruise and Foxx did good enough jobs. Unfortunately, everyone else in the movie were mind-numbing stereotypes. If I was Cruise, who seems to be taking care of his own career and the films he chooses, I would have darn well pointed out all these shortcomings to the writer and director. Are actors so wrapped up in their own roles that they don't know how good or bad the rest of the film is going to be...? Just wondering...Anyway, in the end this movie proved to be just so much glossy movie packaging rather than something that would really engage us or thrill us intellectually. It just wasn't up to it. And finally, the ending was nothing. Like something we'd seen before in twenty other movies. You could sense how the producers picked up the first ending that came out of the box, wanting to finish up and go home having done their routine 9-5 - without the slightest inclination to give us something to think about, like an alternative, surprise, unorthodox ending, that really didn't waste Cruise's rather interesting character.Watchable stuff, but a big disappointment for a movie that's being so highly rated on this website.",Null,0,0,8 August 2004
Gone with the Wind," Cinematic museum piece, not masterpiece
","This is a story by and mainly for women, in any case only women might be able to appreciate and understand Scarlett O'Hara's totally irrational behaviour (if anyone can, please explain it to me). Still, it's such a cinema milestone you have to see it. It's an attractive, fairly durable (and fairly endurable) movie - everything you'd expect from a classic Hollywood epic, though time has revealed some deep flaws in its construction. 
On the positive side, there are some lush sets and rich colours, and the repeated use of silhouettes against a dramatic sky is very effective and memorable. The film also succeeds in making us think: what life was like in the heyday of the South; what the slaves made of it all; the utter waste of war (as always); how we would cope if our lives and homes were suddenly devastated. But unfortunately the film doesn't really want us to think, and scenes are hurried along presumably in order to squeeze in everyone's favourite episode from the book. There are some amusing moments, and some stirring moments - the story is clearly capable of arousing strong emotions, though this is mainly due to the numerous tragic deaths which are so liberally sprinkled throughout the film that we begin to feel distinctly manipulated.This main failing of the film is that there is too much script. The dialogue is rapid fire and unnatural, it is often impossible to hear clearly what is being said. There is little in the way of dramatic silence and every action and emotion is represented or accompanied by an exhausting gush of Southern drawl. At times, such as when Prissy ascends the stairs with Melanie Hamilton, you can sense the actors' real exhaustion with the script.As a result of the script, the acting is too stylized (nobody could speak those lines in a normal voice), and while this is no doubt intentional, subtlety and cinematic effect is sacrificed for an unsatisfying theatricality. In particular, Lesley Howard brings this film to its knees with a performance so wooden you can hear his legs creak, and the narrative slows perceptibly during his every scene. This is very disappointing, as Ashley could have been one of the more interesting and original characters in the story. Originality is generally in short order. Margaret Mitchell's book may well have been a big success but is highly derivative of the feisty 19th century female literature of the South. There is nothing original in GTTW's story of rebellious womanhood, of urbane cads, or of chaps throwing their hats in the air at the prospect of going to war (dusted off yet again in `Cold Mountain'). This over-familiarity may tell on a sophisticated modern audience.Vivien Leigh (who is rarely off-screen) is excellent, almost miraculous, but Scarlett is made to sustain a tone of coquettish petulance for the full duration, and Leigh has no opportunity to modulate dramatic key. The result is a monotonous and eventually annoying performance (not helped by Scarlett's irksome irrationality). Gable and the lovely Olivia de Havilland are also victims of one-dimensional characterization.The power of the film rests largely on the more dismal aspects of the story, and in the end it is the dismal aspects that leave the lasting impression, leaving us feeling slightly ill-at-ease and unsatisfied - particularly concerning the behaviour of Scarlett. To get this movie and its relative merits into perspective, compare Hollywood's facile treatment of another blockbuster novel `War and Peace' with the 1968 Russian version. Then consider again how different - and how much better - GWWT might have been.",Null,1,4,24 August 2004
Three Colors: Blue," Disengaging
","A woman (Juliette Binoche) survives a car crash which kills here husband and child. Her life wrecked, she sells up and withdraws from life. Fortunately she is extremely wealthy  her husband was a world famous composer - in fact we are led to believe she wrote his stuff for him. This had me groaning - the woman's existence is on such impossibly ethereal plane that it undermines the emotional core of the film - the old problem of watching someone suffering who has less excuse for suffering than most. Far more tragic, surely, if they had been struggling and she had been left penniless, but then, Kieslowski is clearly only interested in dealing with refined, precious people - even his Dekalog series dealt mainly with doctors, lawyers, professors and suchlike  it's probably significant that my favourite episode deals with a taxi driver (though not the murdered one). As a result of the socio-economic distancing, Binoche's post-crash trauma is too indulgent, too minutely detailed, too drawn out. The sterile affair she then has with her husband's associate seems predictable, and the salvation achieved in the latter part of the film when she takes to working on the music is only banal.There are some nice things here though. The sense of throwing everything up and withdrawing from the world ('I have only one thing left to do. Nothing.') is something rare and valuable in film. The scene with the rats nest is memorable  it was perhaps the moment in which we can relate to her most. But on the whole, Binoche's character is a priggish, hard-headed, snooty bore, too willful and self-controlled, too wealthy and too preternaturally talented to be of much interest. No doubt Kieslowski was chummy with world famous composers who live in country mansions the size of small citadels and who have wives as tasty and accomplished as Juliette Binoche. The rest of us have to put up with real world.",Null,1,4,3 May 2008
Parasite," Objectionable
","How has this film has won the best film Oscar? What a travesty. It's inane, rebarbative, empty, childish, overlong, silly, dull, cluttered and generally irritating. The social message, presuming there is one, is garbled, superficial and hollow. Everything is over-exaggerated to mind-numbing effect. How easily pleased all the people raving about this film are.There's a dude in the secret basement flashing morse code messages every day on a light upstairs. It doesn't occur to anyone to fix the light. That's just one example of the intellectual level of the utter narrative drivel that we are subjected to here. It would take me too long to go into all the others.It's bad enough that the Academy should be leaping on the 'it's different so it's great' bandwagon. I'm just afraid that the new social idiocracy that we now live in means that we will be subjected to this kind of clueless, jejune fantasy-comedy-horror melange for the next few years.",Null,170,291,10 February 2020
Vicky Cristina Barcelona," Bedazzled
","After confining himself to New York all his life, Woody Allen has now discovered Europe. You can sense his excitement with it all...artists...old buildings...genuine culture rooted in real history, and most importantly, liberated attitudes. Europeans will find his sense of wonder painfully naive. This film is for those who have never heard of Gaudi - Woody seems determined to introduce him to us, as if it is all something new. Okaay, it will be to many, but the real problem here is the idealisation of everything.In Europe you apparently get to live in a millionaire's mansion simply by splashing (literally) paint on a canvas. Even supermodels are artists...nay, geniuses. And the magic of Europe is infectious - Cristina (Scarlett Johanson) miraculously discovers her true talent as a photographer (together with a pretentious rediscovery of the darkroom). It's a shock to discover Woody is really so unsophisticated as to think we need to be handed these little artistic homilies. New York must be a narrower world than New Yorkers think.There's a threesome in this film that comes about simply because everyone is, well, so wonderful in Europe, so avant-garde, so uninhibited - it's a love affair with a continent. Anyway, even if you're European and are choking on this, as well as the usual Allenesque stammering, plus the nagging suspicion that the awful title is infecting the whole film with its ungainliness, you can always simply sit back and enjoy the view. Johansson is gorgeous - and a fine actress in the right role, if only this were one - and Rebecca Hall, who gives a fine, assured performance that holds things together. Javier Bardem seems to be the new Gerard Depardieu, but like Depardieu, should stick to his own language. Woody should stick to New York.",Null,0,0,17 February 2016
The Wizard of Oz," Hidden third layer
","One of those films that helps define the conscience of western civilisation Â– full of those little homilies that the generations pass down. A hundred of them are crystallised here in this film. The theme is wanting things without realising that you have them all the time, a dream whose moral is to stop dreaming. It's still sweet and funny, only occasionally veering too far into the world of cartoonery. I could have done without Toto and the blasted Munchkins Â– though the Lollypop Guild trio are worth seeing. Shirley Temple was considered for the part and would have been good, but then the film would have been without its essence, which, on deep reflection, is July Garland's sexual innocence. Dorothy might well have gone to the Wizard asking for desirability, without realising that she was already the hottest thing in the Land of Oz. The Wicked Witch of the West was clearly envious of Dorothy's beauty Â– that must have been the real power of those ruby slippers.",Null,2,4,3 May 2008
From Here to Eternity," Seamy soldiery
","This has all the hallmarks of a film scratching away at the surface of a popular novel. The literary title seems ill-suited to the pettiness of much of the storyline and it fails to resonate even in the final fate of it's chief character, Prewitt (Montgomery Clift), which seems tagged on and unnecessary, like an alternative ending.Soldiers patronise their officers and chase their wives, squabble amongst themselves, even murder each other over trivial issues that assume life and death importance under the pressure-cooker lid of army life. It's a nasty world of philandering, drunkenness, ineptitude, vanity, and boorishness. The women put the uniformed clowns into context, rejecting them for their inadequacy and their soldier-ant careers. The film pushes away at the edges of the Hays Code (Deborah Kerr really checks out Burt Lancaster as he's getting undressed  but you can't prevent people going for a swim) - but just when you think the film is doing an admirable job of showing the seamy side of humanity and building up to something powerful, it backs down as the boys predictably turn into heroes during the Pearl Harbor attack.The main theme, the hard-head holding out against authority, is the same as in Zinneman's A Man For All Seasons, another film full of squabbling men with a downbeat ending. Clift and Sinatra (drunk much of the time) are outstanding, but the film belongs to Lancaster, bull-necked, angular as a piece of origami, who somehow manages to square uprightness and corruption, solidity and fallibility, and stands astride the rank and ruck of lesser men like a colossus. Classic stuff from the movies' greatest decade.",Null,2,4,21 December 2008
"O Brother, Where Art Thou?"," A colossal misjudgement
","What on earth were the Coen brothers thinking of? Why base a story about 1930s escaped convicts in Mississippi on Homer's Odyssey...? Are they trying to heducate us, or was it just a darn stupid idea?You know the movie is not going to work right from the beginning. Clooney plays an astonishingly annoying guy who prattles on in high falutin' language. Yes yes, we get it - but we still have to listen to him right through the film. The characters and the situations are not funny. There is not one memorable line in the whole movie (perhaps the biggest sin of all). The fantasy elements just make us care less. Scenes creak from one to the next with little meaning or continuity. The quirkiness is too smug and self-conscious. The in-jokes that presumably are meant to keep us nudging our neighbour and justify our time are too obscure and pointless. The clichés pile up: Chain gangs breaking rocks... Big Daddy figure running for governor... KKK shenanigans. All caricatures of caricatures of caricatures... Yawn... Soon we are begging to be shown something original. Oh, the film had a nice colour wash to match the parched landscape, and there was a digitised cow being run down, but artificial gimmicks are not going to make me like the movie. I've usually enjoyed the Coens' movies but O Brother is a huge let down that makes me wonder how much of that all that stuff in the past was actually as good as I thought. One foot either side of the fine line between between quirky genius and utter hogwash.",Null,1,5,4 July 2004
