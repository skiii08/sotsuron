Requiem for a Dream," A master piece with disturbing parallel
","This movie was a blast for me and I thought it was very very well done. A must see for sure, although not for general audience (some humor but tough scenes, both on the emotional side and to some extent, some violence coming from the sordid environment). The casting was quite good - from the main characters, in my view Harry and Sara, to the secondary ones (Marion, Tyron), all play with a pretty good dynamic making the movie and storyline believable. I found the idea of making a parallel between street drugs and controlled drugs a very smart base for this story - In one hand, Harry goes down a trail of addiction, business from drug then go onto a swirl down to hell ... while Sara on weight loss pills become addicted and end up hallucinating and being hospitalized. Both and a the characters are in search for happiness, success, recognition ... they never get. This is a MUST see.",9,0,0,29 August 2011
Guardians of the Galaxy," Surprisingly entertaining
","Note ahead: although I am a huge fan of Marvel comics an consequent (recent years) movies, when I saw the preview, I though this would be a disaster. An enraged raccoon and a tree like creature saying only one thing (his name)? Oh boy! But this movie was not at all what I expected. It was very entertaining, with touching characters all with a unique background and depth delivering all the way. Every one of the character has its issues and to first order, it does not seem like they would be forming the right brew of individuals for a team 'saving the galaxy'. An assassin, a destroyer, an enhanced raccoon and a humanoid tree end to be loosely led through and unlikely bound of friendship and realization of a commonality by the character of Peter Quill aka Star Lord. The dynamic was great, the acting superb for characters which were difficult to embody in the first place.The movie is full of humor and avoids getting you bored with cliché. A scene may start and feel like it will go toward a common lecturing between two characters but aborted by a 'yeah yeah!' and a gun shot. Seems trivial and simple minded but this is just one example (don't want to provide spoilers) that this film is not following the standard framework for the genre, does not take itself that seriously and as a result, is highly entertaining (actually, you probably would have liked to shoot yourself to stop the boring lecturing, wouldn't you?). Some parts and explanation are a bit under-developed (not sure what made the end possible still) but I did not mind. I was equally surprised by the awesome graphics, visual effects and spectacular fast moving and well executed fight scenes.From start to end, I was totally taken by this flick as the dynamic and balance between dialogs & actions was well done and extremely well executed. It was captivating, not pretentious or over-serious, full of humor and overall a great fun. Go see it and judged by yourself (I may go and watch it again if in 3D).",9,1,3,24 September 2014
Super 8," Disappointing at best ...
","Although the acting was good in general and the characters entertaining, this movie comes with no surprises: at first, the atmosphere of an unknown threat to a little town of Ohio tend to grab you. But by the time the plot is understood (very early in the movie), there is a feel of a bad remake of ET mixed with the Goonies mixed with any other movie with a bad alien in a rampage. It is also full of scenes defeating any logic and laws of physics and some of the outcomes make no sense. The (rotted) cherry on top: add to the mix a few classic themes such as 'the two family do not talk to each other but let's get together for our children' or 'the child saves us all and empathize with the Alien' (with a scene to cry for). Nauseating. If there was not so many cliché, it could have been a good movie.",4,6,13,11 June 2011
Thor," Can't believe I watched it to the end ...
","On an airplane, I thought that an action movie would be the perfect way to kill time: I was not expecting a super-script or the greatest movie of all times but this was far below my expectations. This movie is simply bad.The casting is awful, the actors are insipidly acting and emotions are not at all coming through. The story line is in the genre is the worst I have seen. Love story between Thor and a human? Is this what we are lead to believe happened?? Where? When? There was no emotional scene, connection between the characters or hero/love connection of any kind and no character development in general (none!). The story is very poor and under-developed to under-achieved with many holes. Scenes tend to succeed each other without much dynamic and soon, you settle for a mighty boredom. Some of the special effects were 'fine' but overall, the whole thing appeared super-artificial (movie directors, please stop believing that a movie will do great with special effects and no stories or no 'art') and not that entertaining.This movie overall is one of the rare which make me think (not only one third through) that it would be better off stopping before the end rather than continuing - don't waste your time.",3,1,4,24 January 2012
Prometheus," Even with low expectations, you will be bored
","This movie is barely worth a matinée and I would right away recommend waiting for it to come on Netflix or similar. It is unclear if anyone can even write a review containing a spoiler: not only the scenes are very predictable but they make no sense, seem to drop from nowhere and for no purpose and follows no logical order. Ridley Scott's Alien and the incoming of Prometheus raised expectations so naturally, one may expect reviews affected by the hip going sour. But this is not the case. Even with no expectations, this movie is not well threaded as far as the storyline is concerned and direly suffer from story creativity (the visuals are fine).You have all read the IMDb storyline so no need to repeat it. How I understand: engineered goo+albino alien= populate the earth with creatures, goo+worm=snake with acid-like blood (why? where does this come from?), goo+human=not sure what but that raging zombie made no sense and did not fit in the story at all, same goo + human having 'intimate relation' prior to becoming a raging zombie=woman give birth to a squid, squid in a sterile isolated lab with nothing to eat = spontaneous growth out of nowhere to a giant squid, Albino alien+giant squid= Alien (like in the real deal, the Alien movie). Pfiou! We are glad the non-sense cycle ended here - I feared squid + android would create something even more awfully stupid. Again, no spoiler there. As a good sport, I clicked on 'contains spoiler' but you will all know it will happen next when you see the scene unfold. This movie fails to create the climax of the first Alien movie. There is no suspense, plenty of screaming for no reasons (not even frightening), scenes with scientist who clearly have no scientific background or training (careless, not knowledgeable, erratic), ... the list is long. This is not the crew of the Nostromo. Did I mention the Albino aliens resembles the ones in John Carter ? (lack of imagination is the extra killer).The grade of 4 I gave are for: - 2 points for Michael Fassbender (David) and Noomi Rapace (Dr. Shaw) performance. I thought their acting was done well all considering and within their characters. - One point for also for the 3D, I could resisted going leaving the theater before the end - One point for some of the visuals - they were very detailed and quite amazing at times, another disappointment at the end at this movie had great potentials but really no story.",4,4,8,10 June 2012
Donnie Darko," An endearing character in a mad world
","Donnie Darko, a teenager going through life with his family, school and small town events. His condition (apparent mental illness for which he is treated by a psychiatrist and medications) makes him sleep walk and see life around in a surreal manner - speaking giant bunny predicting the future or instructing him to perform acts, vision of vortex connecting space and time, the character is overall very likable in his struggles - his behavior may not be aligned with the rest of the town but would would like to be? His nature and character seems true and it is easier to empathize with him than many of the other characters: he does not buy-in the local showman motivational speech (and turn to be right to doubt his motives), treat people around with interest and sometime care (his newly made girlfriend Gretchen or the lonely depreciated Karen) or paying interest in an old lady (in a sense a key character to his hallucinations).Donny is simply a normal teenager trying to go through life with a sweet side, mixed with apprehension, confusion, awareness, fascination for the unknown but always trying to make sense of the life around him. I really felt the character was one of the most endearing character I have seen. Forget the cast including more famous names such as Patrick Swayze and Drew Barrymore - they get near unnoticed as the principle actor (Jake Gyllenhaal) delivers a stunning performance in his incarnation of Donny Darko. Gyllenhaal as Donny convincingly goes through a range of emotions from happiness, shyness, clumsiness, rage, fear, hopes, care and love as Donny tries to escape the reality of sordid life in high-school and the mad-world around him. At the end, Donny's choices seem to be the right one ending with the ultimate sacrifice for love and saving the one he cares for. And throughout the film, you follow his life completely absorbed in this very stimulating (intellectually and emotionally) master piece.My only disappointment is that I discovered this movie as a near random accident as it seems to be more of an underground movie than a top classic. I watched ti three times already and certainly considering a few more as you always get absorbed by the character, the story line, the orchestration and discover more and more details in this complex maze of intertwined stories and interpretations. Pure art form, very stimulating, this one gets a high rating from me and I highly recommend it.",10,1,4,16 September 2011
