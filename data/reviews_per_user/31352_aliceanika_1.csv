The Ring," I think the Japanese version is better
","I have seen the Japanese version of ' The ring', I think it is better. The atmosphere is so great. I really think this movie is not remake, it's just copying the original version. If you go see the Japanese version, you will find out that the acts are exactly the same. If you have a strong liking of this film, I recommend you the Japanese version.",Null,1,1,17 October 2002
