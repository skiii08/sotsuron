Angels & Demons," Great Adaptation!!!
","I saw this movie as a preview and to say the least I had a wonderful experience. although for some absurd reason the critics in London have grilled the movie but for no reason the director or the movie as a project deserves the thrashing.da vinci code was a good movie but i had my reservations against its adaptation. as far as the adaptation is concerned angels and demons was great. there are a few things that do not coincide with the book but the changes were acceptable and fully justifiable.some sequences have been shown with less depth and some deleted but it has to be kept in mind that if all these minute details were considered, this movie would have been at least 5 hours in lenght. and thats not the case with this movie rather its with any adaptation be it Charlie and the chocolate factory or the Bourne identity.tom hanks as Robert langdon does not need any description. to say the least he carried forward his spell created from da vinci code as Harvard symbologist. the role of Vittoria vetra played by ayelet zurer was carried out efficiently but Ewan McGregor as camerlengo Patrick was the surprise package. his acting was superb! Ron Howard has moved to a different level of direction. direction was nearly flawless.in the end what matters is whether the cast & crew were able to recreate the magic as the author or not. my brother who went with me to see the movie had'nt read the book but was astounded by the 'magic created'. for me its recommended to every movie lover. u wont be disappointed for sure.",9,2,4,15 May 2009
