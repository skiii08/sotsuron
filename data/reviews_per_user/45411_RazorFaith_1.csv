Alien 3," a thrillingly dark and thoughtful tale
","I know it's probably not as good as the others, but for me, this is so different and refreshing that it's my favourite of the series.   It's just so dark, and it focuses on the human element of the characters, i'm not sure, it isn't as well scripted or choreographed as either of the earlier ones, but it feels much more morbid and sad.",10,3,6,16 April 2001
