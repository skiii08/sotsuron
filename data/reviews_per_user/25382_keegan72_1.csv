Skyfall," I feel bad for the casual viewers
","I personally think this movie got a bad rap. Sure all the film critics loved it but for the casual viewer i'm afraid you might not like it which is wrong.I talked to a lot of people who said they weren't a fan of the new bond movie which i think is terrible because Skyfall is an almost perfect movie. I won't say anything about the plot but the director Sam Mendes did a magnificent job, it looked beautiful and it was magnificently paced. Most people might call it boring because all they need is Michael Bay explosions but it was a great story that had me glued to the screen from start to finish, for a nearly 3 hour movie i wanted more. The smart introduction of Q and Moneypenny into the series plus the new M was wonderfully well done and i hope to see them in all the new entries into the series. There is too much to say about this masterpiece. The only thing they could have added to make this a 10 out of 10 would be the famous Shaken not stirred line but i fear it would let the movie down a bit after the last two movies without it. And it would also be nice to see the gun shot at the start next time but if they plan on putting it at the end from now on that would be fine just don't get rid of it, all bond fans know the importance of that tradition. A word of caution to any casual viewers, please don't go into the movie with a casual mentality as you really must watch it closely to fully appreciate the amazing movie that is...
