The Ring," what was that?
",The ring is officially the most overrated film of this year. I went in expecting to be wowed and left wishing there was some way i could get my money back. the movie fills its time block with useless attempts at artsy symbolism which in fact are meaningless. The movie tells a story which could have been adequately told using 15 minutes of the material it showed. The only ALMOST redeeming quality was the cinematography...the images were quite nice but hard to appreciate when absolutely POINTLESS. The entire movie is jumbled; it is quite obvious that someone involved in the creation of the story got carried away then lost themselves trying to bring it back (the horse? the fly?). Complete misuse of good cinematography. i give 'The Ring' * out of *****,Null,4,7,11 November 2002
Pearl Harbor," right...superb...
","this movie is a waste of film and time. Never see it. There are too many flaws to comment on, and if you want to get the idea of the story tune into any daytime soap opera. NO WONDER this movie is in related movies to the 'great masterpiece' titanic.",Null,1,2,11 November 2002
