Sucker Punch," Awful...Just Awful
","My sister and I were talking about the Man of Steel trailer and I said that Zack Snyder probably wasn't the best choice to direct Man of Steel. I gave Sucker Punch being a disappointment for critics and audiences. My sister said it was great. Then again, she likes Green Lantern, Indiana Jones 4 and the Star Wars prequels. So, she lent it to me to watch and I was shocked. Here's why:1. The Plot: It's another bland prison escape movie, just with hot chicks who fight dragons, samurai and zombies for no real reason except that Zack Snyder thought it would be awesome. The problem is, is that the fights with the dragon, samurai, zombies and other things make no sense whatsoever. For example, if they needed an item with a dragon on it, they could've fought the dragon. In a movie that's suppose to be symbolic, that kind of seems like a good idea that the director forgot about. Don't say that I don't get it, because I understood everything about this movie. 2. The Heroes: The heroes are incredibly boring. They show no emotion whatsoever. They don't even seem like they want to be there. By that I mean, the actors don't want to be on set. They don't even bother to ask each other about each other. They could ask each other what their real names are and try to identify themselves outside of this prison, but since when does Zach Snyder care about character development? Also, why not have some of these girls die off in these earlier action sequences? I mean it's a fantasy after all, so they wouldn't actually die, but that would help them make them stronger in the next sequence. But since no one dies, it's just incredibly boring. Also, since all Babydoll has to do to get in these fantasy worlds is dance, why not show the dance? Well, because Zach Snyder says that he didn't want to show her dancing because it was a female empowerment story. So, it was sexist to show her dancing, but it wasn't sexist to show all of the girl's panties while they were fighting? I'll get back to that point later.3. Everyone Else: The main villain is this clichéd villain, who just hates these characters for no real reason other than being a sexist a-hole. Also, he is overacting in every scene he's in. The heroes are under acting and the villains are over acting, and it just comes off as just plain awful. Carla Gugino provides nothing in this movie whatsoever. Also, Babydoll's step dad is an idiot. So he doesn't get money from his wife so in order to get it, he starts raping Babydoll's sister? Why doesn't he just kill them, make it look like an accident and just collect the money? Oh yeah, because all men are idiots and jerks apparently. I'll get back to this point later as well. 4. The Visuals, Cinematography and Music The visuals, which probably drove most people to see it, are not that impressive. I've seen better special effects in TV shows. The cinematography is probably the only good thing in this movie, but it's not that good, it's only okay. The music, I hate the music. All of the music is just cover songs that don't really sound that good. I prefer the original songs. What's wrong with the original songs? Maybe it's copyright reasons, who knows? More importantly, who cares? Apparently I do since I'm writing this review.5. Sexism at its finest This movie manages to be offensive to men and women. It's offensive to men, because it treats every male character like a jerk and an idiot. Not all men are jerks and idiots. Worst of all, they treat women so poorly. They don't give these girls that much of an identity, they're boring, I couldn't care about them. The worst part of that is, is that these girls are tired are being treated as sex objects and are trying to break out of this prison, but they constantly fight all of these random things in slow motion (which there's too much of), half-naked. How is that empowering to women? I don't approve of sexism of any kind, but this movie just doesn't get it.Overall, this was one of the worst movies I've ever seen. It's boring, pretentious, clichéd, predictable and hypocritical movies I've ever seen. The actors are either under acting or over acting. The visuals are not that impressive. They manage to offend men, because it treats them like jerks and a-holes. They manage to offend women, because they sexualize them when they don't want to be sexualized by these clients and are not really all that empowering. It's like watching someone play a video game, they're doing all the action and you're just sitting bored out of your mind. The worst part of this whole experience is not the acting, the accidental sexism, but that my sister yelled at me because I didn't like it. I showed her a list of the most disappointing movies a long time ago and this was placed at number 7. She explained this by saying that people don't understand good filmmaking. This? Good filmmaking? If people don't understand it's good filmmaking, then explain why critics and audiences love movies like The Godfather, Inception, Pulp Fiction, The Shawshank Redemption and The Lord of the Rings to name a few, and why people hate movies like recent spoof movies, Transformers, Twilight, The Last Airbender and others? Calling this good filmmaking is like calling Jersey Shore quality television. I understand it's her opinion and she's a feminist and all. But, she should be offended by the characters and how they're not all that empowering, but I can see where she's coming from. Where I'm coming from, this movie is awful. It manages offend men, women and possibly everyone's intelligence.",1,6,14,20 August 2013
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," Can someone tell me why people love Pirates 3, but hate Spider-Man 3? They're practically the same movie.
","This may be a biased review, but I am not really a big fan of the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise. I mean the first one was pretty okay, it was fun and enjoyable. The second one was okay, but it kind of felt more like Jack Sparrow mania. The third one was just horrible. This movie felt like it was a half hour too long, and it felt like they could've cut a lot of it out. It felt like some of the scenes didn't make sense. Also, some of the scenes dragged on at some points. And the humor that is usually in the movies was just worn out, and just awkward, and by the end pathetic. And towards the end, they try to tie up random loose ends like Will and Elizabeth's relationship during the final battle. During that scene, I was like really. And the whole relationship between Davy Jones and Tia Dalma, just felt ridiculous, and just didn't make sense when Calypso was revealed. It felt more like the second movie, more like a Johnny Depp fest even though he didn't appear in the movie until about thirty minutes in. I really wanted to like this movie more than I thought I would. But I didn't. The worst part of the movie was I kept thinking why was everyone praising this movie as the best movie ever, and Spider-Man 3 the worst movie ever. For the record, neither Pirates 3 or Spider-Man 3 is either the best or worst movie ever. Here's why I brought up Spider-Man 3. Pirates 3 is on the same level as Spider-Man 3. Both featured too many extra characters, both felt too long, both dragged at times, and had numurous plot holes. The only difference is that I thought Spider-Man 3 did it better than Pirates 3. Why would people hate a movie for many reasons, but like a movie even though the same things are in the same movie that everyone hated? It just seemed hypocritical. Sure, the whole Spider-Man 3 comparison might of been irrelevant, but I just thought of it when I was forced to watch Pirates 3. It's the not the worst movie of all time, but it is one of my least favorites.",5,3,4,27 June 2012
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," What's with all the hate?
","First of all, I'm not too big of a fan of The Lord of the Rings. I say that because I have never read the books but the movies are fantastic and I was very excited to see this. But then I heard all of the negative reviews and I was worried. I went in not really expecting much, but I felt it was almost as good as the trilogy. First off, the performances are fantastic, especially from Martin Freeman, Andy Serkis and Ian McKellan. Everybody else is fantastic in the roles. I also liked the comic relief in the movie, as I felt that the first trilogy was a little too serious at times. But don't worry, it isn't like the Star Wars trilogy at all. At least The Hobbit's tolerable. Also, I know it's almost three hours long, but it felt like an hour and a half. Any movie that can do that is good in my book. The scene between Gollum and Bilbo is also worth the price of admission alone. But like most movies, it's not perfect. While I enjoyed the comic relief at first, it did get old by the middle of the movie. But if you love The Lord of the Rings, just go in and lower you expectations a little bit, and you will enjoy it.",8,2,8,23 February 2013
2012," 2012
","One of the worst movies I have ever seen. IT was just a terrible movie. It was inaccurate, overlong, lacks a good story, and pretty stupid. I never believed in this whole 2012 crap, but the trailer looked made it look good. But, if the trailer looks good, it's probably a terrible movie. 2012 pretty much proves this. It also has characters you don't really care about, if they die no one gives a crap. You don't even care about a dog in the movie. And who's idea was it to cast John Cusack? He was just terrible, everyone was just god awful in this movie. I had to watch in my Earth Science class last year over Armageddon. I would have rather watched Armageddon over this piece of crap. The only thing that is good about the movie is the special effects, but you only saw the good ones in the trailer. This is the third worst movie I have ever seen. Behind The Core and The Last Airbender, I'm letting you know I'm only giving one star, because I'm forced to give at least one star.",1,9,13,22 February 2011
